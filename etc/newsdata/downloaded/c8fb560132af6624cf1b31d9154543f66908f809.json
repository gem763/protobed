And it remains a dangerous threat in Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is: This puts the enemy on its heels, but the ideology \u2014 and this sounds so cliched \u2014 it is not dead,\u201d said Chris Costa, a former senior director for counterterrorism for the National Security Council in the Trump administration.\n\nKey to the Islamic States is its \u201ckill where you are\u201d ethos, encouraging a far-flung network of followers, including those in the United States, to commit violence however and wherever they can. That jihadist message is likely to live on, even with the death of al-Baghdadi.\n\nThat means U.S. forces, perhaps in reduced numbers, will continue hunting and attacking key Islamic State targets, even as Trump says he\u2019s committed to a 2016 campaign pledge to bring them home and end \u201cendless wars\u201d started under his predecessors.\n\nTrump earlier this month went from declaring a near-complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria to deciding that some \u2014 perhaps several hundred \u2014 must stay to keep eastern Syria\u2019s oil fields from falling back into the hands of the Islamic State. Trump also agreed to keep about 150 U.S. troops at a base in southern Syria.\n\nIn announcing Sunday that al-Baghdadi had blown himself up after being cornered in a dead-end underground tunnel in Syria, Trump acknowledged that IS, which he often calls \u201c100 percent\u201d defeated, still has ambitions to make a comeback. The group is \u201cvery, very strongly looking to build it again,\u201d he said.\n\nThis, he said, explains why Baghdadi was in the Idlib province of northwestern Syria, an area largely controlled by a rival group \u2014 the al-Qaida-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 although other jihadi groups sympathetic to Islamic State are also there.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s where he was trying to rebuild from because that was the place that made most sense, if you\u2019re looking to rebuild,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump suggested that other countries, including Russia, carry on the fight against IS, but there is no indication that U.S. forces will abandon the mission any time soon.\n\n\u201cOur job is to stay on top of that and to make sure that we continue to take out their leadership,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, said five years of U.S. and coalition effort inside Syria have not eliminated the Islamic State threat.\n\n\u201cWhile the death of its leader is a tremendous blow for the group, about 10,000 ISIS fighters remain in the region and will continue to carry out guerrilla attacks and seek new territory,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to defense officials in Iraq and Afghanistan who study Islamic State and have watched its movements, the group is growing in power and numbers outside of Syria.\n\nIts flagship affiliate is known as ISIS-Khorasan in Afghanistan, and it is expanding into other countries, including Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Many of those affiliates have liaisons in the terror group\u2019s hub in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nIn addition to conducting high-profile attacks inside Afghanistan, the official said the Islamic State has also already proven its ability to inspire and enable terrorist attacks outside Afghanistan, including a deadly one in Sweden.\n\nIt is this global reach that makes the Islamic State a continuing worry, including for U.S. officials seeking to protect the homeland.\n\nAl-Baghdadi served as a direct inspiration for extremists in the United States, where multiple jihadists in the last five years invoked his name as they carried out deadly acts of violence.\n\nOmar Mateen, the gunman who in 2016 killed 49 people inside an Orlando, Florida nightclub, pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi during a 911 call in which he identified himself as an Islamic soldier. Months earlier, Tashfeen Malik, who along with her husband killed 14 people at a San Bernardino, California, holiday party, took to Facebook after her massacre was already underway to declare her support for al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cThat voice, the face associated with it \u2014 the name in particular \u2014 it\u2019s all directly linked to those in the United States who have pledged allegiance to him so as to conduct attacks in the group\u2019s name,\u201d said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the Obama administration.\n\nThe death of al-Baghdadi leaves the group without an equally brand-name successor and deprives would-be jihadists of a figurehead leader to rally behind. Counterterrorism experts say that leadership void is a significant loss for a terror group that had lost the vast stretches of the physical caliphate in Syria and Iraq it had once controlled. But they also caution that they expect the group\u2019s ideology to endure beyond al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said, yes, I will celebrate when Baghdadi is dead, but at the same time, that celebration is quiet and quick, because there are other Baghdadis out there who have been radicalized,\u201d said Costa, the former NSC official.\n\nStill, Costa said, the raid was hugely significant in part because it shows the U.S. can use solid intelligence to carry out a successful military operation, no matter the current Syria policy.\n\n\u201cThis impacts morale and that\u2019s an important idea \u2014 the fact that the enemy is on the run. We can track them, and we can hunt them, and we can kill them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lolita C.
