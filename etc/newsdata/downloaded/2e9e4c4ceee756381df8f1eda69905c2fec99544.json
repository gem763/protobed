Despite such preconceived notions, Singaporean avant-rock band The Observatory is marking a nearly twenty-year trajectory through multiple line-up changes, while homegrown record labels like Ujikaji Records are curating seminal releases that support independent artists through their sonic experimentation.\n\nThe latest constellation of The Observatory features Yuen Chee Wai & Dharma Shan on guitars and Cheryl Ong on drums; with Ong and Yuen multitasking on electronics. Their recent live performance featured elements of prepared guitar with spoons, wood mallets and violin bows.

Sound travels faster and farther. The ethos of the underground is now broadcast overground.\n\nBlackKajiXtra - Nusasonic drew a crowd with its curation of forward-looking experimental musicians.

Take for instance Bali-based Gabber Modus Operandi\u2019s frenetic face-melting tempos paired with Thai voguer Amazon Sun\u2019s fluid fem poses. Or the raw energy from Setabuhan\u2019s modern take on tribal trance music matched with the tension and spectacle of sparring performances by Singaporean silat clubs. There\u2019s also notorious Singaporean techno-punks Horizon99 joined by Bangkok-based post-internet drag queen Nuh Peace in a celebration of the queering of club culture.\n\nMore than ever, experimental music is about rebuilding connections - to other humans, and to our histories.\n\nKasimyn of Gabber Modus Operandi on the decks.

Experimental sound is becoming closely intertwined with the spirit of underground party culture in upholding an environment for openness, acceptance and freedom.\n\nThe raw energy from Setabuhan \u2019s modern take on tribal trance music matched with the tension and spectacle of sparring performances by Singaporean silat clubs.

Through such performances, we become part of a rite, and are confronted with the power of musical vibrations.\n\nIcan of Gabber Modus Operandi supplies powerful vocals and performance reminiscent of his punk roots. Photo courtesy of BlackKajiXtra - Nusasonic.\n\nGabber Modus Operandi is making waves on international party circuits for constructing an Indonesian hardcore rave fantasy, riding on the energy of jathilan, supported by beats of kendhang drums found in dangdut koplo and pentatonic scales of gamelan. They recently released HOXXXYA on Shanghai-based label SVBKVLT, and went on tour in China to seal that Asian connection. They even performed all the way in Uganda at Nyege Nyege Festival this year, alongside a whole host of Chinese artists such as 33EMYBW, Hyph11E and Kilo Vee.\n\nSingaporean producer FAUXE mined Malaysian folk and pop music for his album Ikhlas. Photo courtesy of BlackKajiXtra - Nusasonic.\n\nWith less boundaries and barriers to entry, cross-cultural exchange and recontextualisation is rife. During a long stay in Kuala Lumpur, Singaporean producer FAUXE mined Malaysian folk and pop music for his album Ikhlas, and polished his rock solid finds with playfulness and dance floor-ready sampling dexterity.\n\n\n\nAll around, we see artists going back to the roots in a world where everything is overground.\n\nInstead of pushing sonic limits and asking the question \u201cwhat is music?\u201d, experimental music today is bringing the organic back to the electronics. It is punk of the digital era, an invitation to return to the bunker of collective being, as defense against disillusionment with our broken socio-political structures. It is about finding release and freedom through our connections with each other.\n\nRully Shabara conducts Cari Padu, a participatory performance art piece involving public to form spontaneous improvised choir, exploring the role of voice and harmony in community. Photo courtesy of BlackKajiXtra - Nusasonic.\n\nIn the words of Rully Shabara, vocalist of Setabuhan and renowned experimental band Senyawa: \u201cIt all comes down to knowing what we need. It\u2019s not financial, it\u2019s not money, it\u2019s not support from the government. It\u2019s working together. [...] It\u2019s about networking and infiltrating. \u201d\n\nSharon Shum is the Content Manager of VICE Asia who believes noise and movement are essential to life.", "description": "As regional artists increasingly come together, more than ever, experimental music is about rebuilding connections - to other humans, and to our histories.", "authors": ["Gavin Butler", "Caleb Quinley", "Sarah Ngu"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d75d229d412b700085a4981/lede/1568002808801-nsa-60.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
