Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nWhen did you find out you got in?\n\nThe end of March. I missed a call, and then they called my mom, I guess, because I got a text from her saying \u201cIs your phone on? Is everything all right? Did you happen to get any phone calls?\u201d Then I was just sitting around dying and waiting, and finally I got a call from a 212 number. And I thought, OMG, that\u2019s a New York number.\n\nHow does it feel to be here? Have you ever heard of impostor syndrome?\n\nYes. Well, there seems to be a little bit of that going around in the freshman class. There are only 24 dance students, and thousands and thousands applied. We\u2019ve all been sort of wondering if we got in by mistake. But then, actually, the president of the school said during his welcome speech, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t get in by mistake.\u201d So that was pretty reassuring.\n\nAlexander Ramazanov, 23, Florida, Trumpet.

And as soon as I picked it up, I knew: The trumpet was the instrument I was looking for.\n\nRachel Qin, 19, Beijing, Flute. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nEirin Rognerud, 20, Lommedalen, Norway, Vocal Arts.

Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nDid you expect to get in?\n\nWell, I\u2019d gotten rejected before. When they finally let me in, I said, \u201cAre you sure? No take-backsies. They were like, \u201cYes, no take-backsies!\u201d\n\nLi Hanke, 17, New York, Violin. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nCoby Petricone-Berg, 18, New York, Jazz Saxophone.

Then I must have looked like I\u2019d been sweating a lot, because they offered me water.\n\nXiaofu Ju, 19, Nanjing, Piano. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nAmari Frazier, 18, Illinois, Dance.

Everyone was very mature, and it was a very deep conversation.\n\nLuk Rosario, 18, New York, Drama. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nJade Diouf, 18, Washington, D.C., Dance.

After each, they make cuts. After ballet, no one called me, so I turned to leave. Then I heard it: \u201cMakani! Makani!\u201d\n\nStella Everett, 18, Sydney, Drama.

But I am quite prepared for any sort of teacher because I had some very strict ones back in Chicago. Sometimes there\u2019d be yelling. Yelling doesn\u2019t faze me.\n\nZiyao Guo, 18, Connecticut, Piano. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nJake Safirstein, 18, Oregon, Composition. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nWho were you with when you got in?\n\nMy dad. It was a nice confirmation for him that I hadn\u2019t been dicking around during all those hours spent alone in my room.\n\n*This article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
