At the hearing, Thunberg and other students were stunned by the questions they received from the adults in the room, which included, \u201cWhy should we listen to the science?\u201d Really.\n\nBut she was also flanked by what appeared to be a boy angel, who rose up suddenly to shield Thunberg from photographers when she was sitting outside the Capitol during a press conference ahead of the hearing.\n\nThe Guardian caught the actions of this tiny bodyguard, who leapt up like a mini bouncer at a club for children, using his very small wingspan to block photographers as Thunberg sat talking with other teens. While her champion stood stone-faced, projecting steely reserve, Thunberg smiled.\n\nWho is this brave boy? We may never, ever know. (In any case, he should certainly receive some type of commendation \u2014 can they give out the Congressional Medal of Honor to middle-schoolers?)\n\nBut he represents the absolute courageousness of these kids who, in all seriousness, are up against some supremely ignorant, fully grown politicians. Instead of the usual introduction, Thunberg\u2019s opening statement to her testimony at the hearing lasted only 90 seconds, during which she pointed to the UN\u2019s IPCC report on climate change. \u201cI am submitting this report as my testimony because I don\u2019t want you to listen to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take action.\u201d", "description": "A tiny bodyguard leapt up to shield fellow child Greta Thunberg from photographers today on Capitol Hill; Thunberg and other young people are there to testify in Congress and demand action on climate change.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/18/17-cherub-greta-thunberg-guardian-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
