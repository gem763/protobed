I've supported the inquiry,\" she said at the town hall. \"I still remain concerned about this inquiry being overshadowed by partisan interests.\"\n\nGabbard doubled down on her stance on impeachment, telling Hannity, \"I have long expressed my concern about going through impeachment proceedings in a very, very partisan way because it will only further tear apart an already divided country.\"\n\n\"I think there are areas of concern that were raised around the conversations that happened between Trump and the Ukranian president, which is why I supported the inquiry,\" she said of the July 25 phone call between the two leaders. Congressional Democrats alleged that Trump tried to pressure Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, the 2020 hopeful and former vice president, and his son Hunter for possible corruption in exchange for the release of foreign military aid. Trump repeatedly has denied doing anything wrong.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGabbard continued, \"I think that the inquiry needs to be done in a very narrowly focused way and it must be done transparently. I don't what going on in those closed doors. We, as members of Congress, don't have access to the information that is being shared and I think the American people deserve to know exactly what the facts are, what the evidence is that is being presented as this inquiry goes on.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers on Wednesday stormed a secure House facility, stopping a closed-door deposition related to the Trump impeachment inquiry, to protest what they called a lack of transparency by House Democrats.", "description": "Democratic hopeful Tulsi Gabbard, who has recently defended herself against assertions that she is a Russian asset, accused the Democratic National Committee (DNC) of \"trying to hold a pre-primary,\" in the media to weed out a potential 2020 party nominee.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
