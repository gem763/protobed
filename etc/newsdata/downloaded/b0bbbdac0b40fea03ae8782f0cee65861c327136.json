(AP) - It was a cold Monday morning at C.V. Koogler Middle School in Aztec. Students stumbled into Shannon Albores\u2018 history class and take off their rumpled jackets. After reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, they greeted their teacher by saying in unison, \u2018magandang umaga!\u2019- which is Filipino for \u2018good morning.\u2019\n\nAlbores was born and raised in a city called Cebu in the Philippines. There she earned a teaching credential and started teaching kindergarten and elementary school. She liked it, but after learning of an opportunity to teach abroad - and with it, the chance to earn a higher salary - she took the opportunity.\n\nAlbores, along with seven other teachers from various parts of the Philippines, started working in the Aztec Municipal School District at the start of the 2019 school year to fill persistently unfilled vacancies at the school district, especially in special education departments in all grade levels.\n\n\u201cThese are positions that had been vacant for seven years,\u201d said Tania Prokop, the Deputy Superintendent of the Aztec Municipal School District, \u201cluckily we found a local company to bring teachers here from the Philippines.\u201d\n\nThat Farmington-based company charges fees to those teachers, and its owner said she keeps those fees as low as possible because she, herself, paid much higher fees when she came to this country years ago through another agency that charged her twice as much.\n\nSchool districts, like Aztec, and others throughout the country have turned to an emerging international contract teacher industry that recruits teachers from around the world to teach in school districts throughout the country. One of those contracting companies, Bepauche International, has its offices in Farmington.\n\n\u201cOur pool of teachers can be 500 to 1000 teachers big. We\u2019re ready and willing to fill vacancies,\u201d said Cheryl Marie Maghinay, the co-owner of Bepauche International, via telephone from the Philippines, where she was on a recruiting trip looking for Filipino teachers to send to schools across the U.S.\n\nMaghinay herself was a teacher, immigrating to the U.S. from General Santos city in the Philippines. She got her masters degree in education in the United States, and then taught in Antelope Valley, California, and then on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona.\n\nOn the Navajo Nation, Maghinay said she saw the need schools in the U.S. had for teachers, especially in rural schools, so in 2015 she said she started Bepauche International to bring qualified Filipino teachers to the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe check to see if our teachers are legitimate,\u201d Maghinay said. The teachers she works with not only have to have a degree in education, and years of experience teaching, but she said she also looks for teachers with a certain amount of familiarity with U.S. culture.\n\nMaghinay then coordinates with school districts in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Florida, Montana, and now New Mexico, for teachers that she vets to conduct interviews with school administrators over video telecommunications apps like Skype.\n\nThe Aztec school district isn\u2019t alone in its teacher vacancies problem. School districts throughout the state, and the country, are in dire need of qualified teachers.\n\nA report published in 2018 by New Mexico State University found that there were 740 unfilled public school teacher vacancies throughout the state. Some school districts have tried to fill those positions by hiring more long-term substitute teachers.\n\nThe New Mexico State University study points to factors that may explain why there might be so many unfilled teaching positions - comparatively low salaries, working conditions and high work expectations, as well as a high level of stress revolving around job insecurity and a high rate of student testing.\n\nThe problem, however, plagues school districts nationwide. A study from the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank, estimated that the country currently has a shortage of 112,000 teachers.\n\nMaghinay first started working here in the U.S. on a temporary worker visa, called a H-1B visa.\n\nInitially Bepauche worked with Filipino teachers to get them H-1B visas, which allows recipients to stay and work in the country for a maximum of six years, with the option to apply for citizenship while working. But as the Trump administration began its crackdown on immigration, H-1B visas eventually came under scrutiny, and in 2019 32% of H-1 B visas were denied, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services documents released through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nNow Bepauche, and numerous international teaching contracting companies across the country, apply for J-1 visas, that technically are for students and teachers participating in \u201ccultural exchange,\u201d programs. The visa can be extended for a maximum of five years, and recipients cannot apply for citizenship or permanent residence.\n\nThe end result of the complex process that brings teachers from other countries to San Juan County happens in the classrooms.\n\nAlong with teaching her students bits and pieces of the Filipino language, C.V. Koogler Middle School history teacher Albores says when she teaches aspects of world history, she tries to include snippets of Pilipino history into her lesson, and how that history connects and interacts with world history - especially U.S.-Philippine relations.\n\nThat subject matter not only includes the American invasion and occupation of the Philippines from 1899 to 1902, but also the establishment of the first public school system by Americans in the Philippines.\n\n\u201cWe learn from the culture, but at the same time we share our culture,\u201d says Albores, \u201cOur students are very interested. They ask a lot of questions. It\u2019s a privilege for me to be in a history class, I can share the history of the Philippines.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will learn a lot from here,\u201d said Erika Rose-Cahilig, a fifth grade teacher who is also contracted through Bepauche at Park Avenue Elementary, \u201cThere are big opportunities for teachers to learn, at the same time, we will have a chance to share and talk about our culture.\u201d\n\nMaghinay moved to Farmington in 2016 to take on a teaching position at Kirtland Central High School, and, with her, Bepauche moved into a small office on Main street. With that office space, Maghinay built and now co-owns a Filipino grocery store and restaurant attached to her office called Manila Sunrise. It is filled with Filipino snacks, frozen fish, Boba milk tea and a rotating menu of Filipino dishes cooked by Mary Grace Hundumon.\n\nMaghinay hopes that the market can not only serve the needs of San Juan County\u2019s Filipino population, which she described as, \u201cbigger than you think,\u201d but she also hopes that the market can introduce Filipino food and culture to local people.\n\n\u201cIn the Philippines rice is the staple food, here it\u2019s a side dish,\u201d said Riva Alipin, an integrated algebra teacher at Aztec High who is also contracted by Bepauche. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly adjusting, but we\u2019re gaining weight because of carbs and more calories in the food here.\u201d\n\nAlipin, Rose-Cahilig, Albores, and five other international teachers all live in an apartment complex in Aztec.\n\nThey all agree that they are enjoying working in Aztec, but there are adjustments. Other than the cold weather, the teachers are adjusting to the food in Aztec, behavioral problems in their classes, and some still feel a little bit jet lagged from a 14-hour plane ride from the Philippines that ended in Albuquerque the weekend before school started,\n\n\u201cOf course we miss the food, and our family, but it\u2019s okay, through the internet we can contact them anytime,\u201d said Alipin, \u201cbut that is the biggest challenge we have to endure, being far away from home.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge rarely talked about is the fee each teacher paid to come to Aztec. Bepauche itself charged $4,500 for \u201cservice fees.\u201d Another $4,000 went to procuring visa and transcript services, and another $1,500 went toward airplane tickets and other miscellaneous travel costs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s big money in our country,\u201d said Alipin, \u201clike a half million.\u201d\n\nAlbores described having to go into debt to a \u201cloan shark\u201d in the Philippines to help raise the needed funds.\n\nMaghinay acknowledges the high cost, and the debt that most of her clients have to take on to pay it, but, she said, \u201cI paid a lot of money when I first got here, so I try to make our prices fair.\u201d The $10,000 is about half of the total amount of what she said she paid when she came to the U.S.\n\nIn 2010 a group of Filipino contract teachers filed a class action lawsuit against the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, claiming they were cheated out of tens of thousands of dollars and forced into exploitative contracts.\n\nMaghinay stresses that she, and her company, are transparent at the very beginning about the cost of her services.\n\n\u201cI have to protect our teachers,\u201d she said, \u201cI know what they\u2019re going through. I remember I got depression, I couldn\u2019t sleep when I first got to the U.S., I know all of those things. We treat teachers like our own family.\u201d\n\nThe contracted teachers interviewed for this story had nothing but praise for both Bepauche and the Aztec school district.\n\n\u201cHere we found a family,\u201d Alipin said, \u201cWe are happy to be in Aztec.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Times, http://www.daily-times.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It was a cold Monday morning at C.V.
