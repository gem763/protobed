These tools build on a feature rolled out in May that allowed users to more easily manage and delete data.\n\nThe new features are part of a broader attempt to make privacy controls the same across Google's products and therefore easier to use, Eric Miraglia, director of product management for Google's privacy and data protection office, wrote in a blog post announcing the features.\n\n\"Managing your data should be just as easy as making a restaurant reservation, or using Maps to find the fastest way back home,\" Miraglia wrote.\n\nThe security tools will roll out for Android this month and iOS \"coming soon,\" according to the blog post.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the new features and how they work.", "description": "The new features are part of a broader attempt to make privacy controls the same across Google's products and therefore easier to use.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94a835d5985803974b0c37?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
