What we have presented today will showcase the huge potential of 5G applications for both the private and business sectors,\" said Olaf Swantee, CEO of Sunrise.\n\nThe 5G Joint Innovation Center is the latest among many instances where the two companies have worked together. Last week, the Chinese equipment provider and the Swiss telco partnered up to achieve a top speed of 3.67Gbps with multiple 5G smartphones during speed tests in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nThe test was conducted over the 100MHz wave spectrum brand and used Sunrise's 5G network.\n\nEarlier this year, Huawei opened a 5G research lab in South Korea, which it claimed was the \"world's first 5G Open Lab\".\n\nHuawei's telco equipment is currently banned in the US, Australia, and Japan, with the countries citing that the company is likely to conduct espionage or be subject to extrajudicial directions from China as the reasons behind the bans.\n\nDespite these security concerns, Huawei's telco equipment has continued to be used in Europe. Switzerland was the first country in Europe to roll out its 5G networks, with Sunrise using Huawei's telco equipment to build out its 5G networks.\n\nMeanwhile in the UK, all major telcos in the country are using Huawei's 5G equipment for their rollouts. This is despite the UK government not yet making a decision on whether Huawei equipment can be used in the UK's 5G network.\n\nSunrise currently has the largest 5G network in Switzerland, covering more than 262 towns and cities with 5G.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nMalaysian Maxis signs up to Huawei for 5G\n\nChinese telco equipment manufacturing giant to supply LTE and 5G radios and services.\n\nHuawei and Airtel use 1Gbps microwave MIMO backhaul for 5G\n\nAdding carrier aggregation will see links hit 2Gbps across two lots of 28MHz spectrum.\n\nHuawei opens flagship store in Shenzhen\n\nIn the works since 2017, the Chinese smartphone maker's three-storey flagship store spans 1,300 square metres and is manned by 120 consultants who hail from various fields including hotel, art, and aviation.\n\nHuawei urges Australia to embrace better Chinese products\n\nHuawei Australia chairman John Lord said Huawei is willing to allow the Australian government to test its products to make this happen.\n\nHuawei drops lawsuit against US after having its telco equipment returned\n\nThe telco equipment was detained for two years.\n\nMicrosoft's top lawyer: Trump's Huawei ban makes no sense\n\nHuawei ban is like preventing a hotel chain from buying beds, says Microsoft president Brad Smith.", "description": "It is Huawei's first 5G research centre in Europe.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/df3d9234-a77a-4091-bd4d-59b3b23c2d41/thumbnail/770x578/b2ddfbe0065e6e6deb9da2a9fe8e7273/istock-10287100281.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
