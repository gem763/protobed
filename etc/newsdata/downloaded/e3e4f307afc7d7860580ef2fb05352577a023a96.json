How they vote and if they vote could have a big impact on who wins.\n\nAs part of our election texting initiative, we've been hearing from a bunch of young voters curious about what they need to know to vote. Here are some of the most common and interesting questions we've received.\n\nIf yours didn't make the list, text ELECTION to 22222 and we'll try to get back with an answer.\n\nHow do I register to vote?\n\nIf you haven't voted in a federal election before, you'll need to register \u2014 it's a requirement to vote. You can register before Oct. 15 here or at an Elections Canada office. You can also register in person when you go to the polls on election day or in the advance polls running Oct. 11 to 14.\n\nThere's a chance you're already on the voters list. You can check that here.\n\nI'm turning 18 right before the election. Am I allowed to vote?\n\nWe heard from someone turning 18 the day before the election who was curious if there is any sort of waiting period to process registration.\n\nElections Canada says as long as you are at least 18 on Oct. 21, you are good to vote. And though you still may be 17 right now, you can actually register to get on the voters list in advance right here.\n\nAnd yes, this also means you can't vote in the advance polls if you don't turn 18 before them.\n\nStudents smile after voting early on campus at Ryerson University in Toronto. There are many options for youth hoping to vote: in-person on election day or in the advance polls, on campus, at an Elections Canada office or you can even apply to vote by mail. (John Beebe)\n\nIs anyone considering changing the voting age limit?\n\nIt's an idea that's been mulled over many times \u2014 even Canada's elections chief thinks it is \"worth considering.\" Advocates argue it could help squash voter apathy at a young age.\n\nThe change would have to happen in Parliament though. So both the NDP and the Greens are campaigning on lowering the voting age to 16. The Liberals have said they won't touch it.\n\nWhat are you voting for exactly?\n\nIn a few of the questions we received, there was some confusion about exactly who you vote for in this election.\n\nYou get one vote \u2014 and that's for your local MP.\n\nHow you choose to vote is up to you. Some people choose to vote for their local candidate, for a party or that party's leader. But your actual vote is for that MP. The candidate who gets the most votes locally will represent your riding on Parliament Hill.\n\nAnd you probably already know this already, but it's worth repeating: Canadians don't vote directly for a prime minister.\n\nWhat does the ballot look like?\n\nIf you are voting in the advance polls or on election day, the candidates in your riding will be listed on your ballot. It will look a little something like this.\n\n(Elections Canada)\n\nTo properly vote, mark the circle beside the candidate you want to vote for. It can be an X or another mark to make it clear that is the candidate you want to vote for.\n\nIf you are voting by special ballot (that includes voting by mail or at an Elections Canada office), you'll be given a ballot where you have to write in the name of the candidate you want to vote for. If you write the party name down, it won't be counted.\n\nIf you misspell the name of the candidate, your vote is at the discretion of the deputy returning officer. If the intent is clear \u2014 Elections Canada gives the example of spelling MacDonald instead of McDonald \u2014 then the vote will most likely still be counted.\n\nWhat if I voted for the wrong person?\n\nIt happens. If you put a mark beside someone you didn't want to vote for, let a polling staffer know. Your ballot will then be counted as a \"spoiled ballot\" and will be kept secret. They are tracked, but the number of \"spoiled ballots\" aren't made public.\n\nElections Canada will give you a replacement ballot but will also warn you that you only get one replacement.\n\nIf it's already gone into the ballot box, it's too late. There's no way to take back your ballot then.\n\nHow do I vote if I'm at school/living somewhere else?\n\nIt depends on which riding you want to cast a vote in.\n\nIf you consider your student/away from home housing (including residence buildings) your current home and have valid ID confirming the address (you can use a voter card for this), you can vote in that riding at a polling station in the advance polls or on election day. You can update your address here.\n\nStudents walk toward the voting station at Conestoga College in Kitchener. (Kate Bueckert/CBC)\n\nIf you want to vote at your home away from where you are right now, you can do it via mail by applying here. Or you can head to the local Elections Canada office before Oct. 15 and vote there for your \"home\" riding.\n\nElections Canada is also running polls on 115 different campuses across the country from Oct. 5 to 9, where you can vote for either your current riding or your riding back home. There is a full list of all the schools involved here.\n\nHow do I get involved if I'm too young to vote?\n\nThere are plenty of ways to get involved if you aren't old enough to vote just yet.\n\nIf it's a party or candidate you want to support, you can contact a particular campaign and volunteer your time. You are also allowed to donate money to a campaign, but parties have to be sure you are doing it \"willingly,\" using your own money.\n\nYou can also get involved by applying to work at the polls themselves. The jobs are open for those who are 16 and older on election day. You might have to take the day off school but, hey, it's a good learning experience and you get to make money!\n\nWhat are the parties doing for young people?\n\nYoung voters came out in droves in the last election, contributing to the big bump in overall turnout. Elections Canada estimates that about 57 per cent of the population between the ages of 18 and 34 voted in 2015, up from a mere 42.5 per cent in 2011. That's about 1.2 million more voters \u2014 votes which parties are hungry for.\n\nThere are some specific promises parties are making to appeal to youth voters \u2014 including climate change initiatives, cellphone bills and bans on unpaid internships.\n\nBut perhaps the most explicit pitch to young people is through each party's education platform.\n\nUntil election day, we'll be rounding up your questions and answering some in articles like the one you just read. If you've got questions (youth vote related or otherwise), text \"ELECTION\" to 22222 or send Haydn an email at haydn.watters@cbc.ca. He'll try his very best to get you an answer \u2014 he may even add it to this article or include it in a future one.", "description": "We've been getting lots of questions from young people voting for the very first time.
