Her overarching theory of what\u2019s wrong in the country is that the power of the big guys\u2014lobbyists, Wall Street, corporations, and the government in cahoots with them\u2014keeps the system from working for the little guy.\n\nTo emphasize her point, she re-released her plan, embodied in proposed legislation, to stop corruption where it thrives, among the ruling class exchanging money for influence. For drama, she spoke in the shadow of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, where 146 people, mostly young female immigrants, burned to death in 1911. That\u2019s what happens, she said, \u201cwhen the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people.\u201d\n\nFor a show of power, she was introduced by Maurice Mitchell, the president of the influential Working Families Party, whose coveted endorsement she snatched from Bernie Sanders that very day. The group claims progressive wins in dozens of races across the country, and its backing may be a sign to the Bernie bros that it\u2019s safe to come over should he drop out.", "description": "Biden is electable because he tops the polls.
