I would ask the DUP to accept this compromise.\"\n\nOn Monday the DUP were being wooed on all sides - with Labour's Keir Starmer saying he was courting the party.\n\nBut the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the Belfast Telegraph: \"We'll be back in Westminster and we'll be engaging with the Government in the next 24 hours on how we move this forward.\"", "description": "European Research Group chairman Steve Baker urged to vote for the deal despite their fears for Northern Ireland's place in the UK", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Will Oliver Epa-Efe Rex", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20644297.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Cabinet-Meeting-in-London-United-Kingdom-16-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
