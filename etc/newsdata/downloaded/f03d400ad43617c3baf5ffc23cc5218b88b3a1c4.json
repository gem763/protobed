The day is overcast and the light is flat. Our ship is floating in front of a patchwork of dark new ice and white snow that looks much like any other. It takes me a minute to realise that there is a much larger floe in the distance.\n\n\u201cWe have just parked this far away so as not to damage it,\u201d says Stefan Hendricks of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), an ice expert on the Mosaic expedition, the largest-ever scientific voyage to the Central Arctic. Just in front of the bow of the ship is a refrozen lead \u2013 a large fracture in the sea ice \u2013 covered in a thin layer of blackish-grey ice. Beyond the lead is the white expanse of the floe. (Read more about the Mosaic mission to the Arctic.)\n\nMatt Shupe of the University of Colorado, who had the initial idea for the expedition, and Markus Rex of AWI, who is now leading it, lean over a pair of images on a screen. They try to orient themselves and match up the information from the ship\u2019s radar to what they can see out of the window. They are looking at a large ice floe, about 2.5km (1.5 miles) by 3.5km (2.2 miles), in an elongated hexagonal shape. They are assessing its potential as a home for the expedition over the next year.", "description": "The largest Arctic expedition in history has been struggling to find ice thick enough to support their mission, but one unusual ice floe offers them some hope.", "authors": ["Martha Henriques", "In The Arctic"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/fb/p07rfbgf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
