That allowed her to become the first tennis player representing Japan to reach No. 1 in the rankings.\n\nThe 13th-seeded Bencic, who is from Switzerland and has been mentored by Martina Hingis, showed again that she is a big-match player. She improved to 3-0 against Osaka this season and now has a tour-leading nine victories over top-10 opponents in 2019.\n\nBencic also is 4-1 over her career against top-ranked players.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Naomi Osaka's 10-match U.S. Open winning streak and title defense are done after she was outplayed in the fourth round by Belinda Bencic and lost 7-5, 6-4.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/US_Open_Tennis_68218.jpg-d1355_c61-0-5245-3023_s1770x1032.jpg?b103dcddfce43cb10394ab8670a127a07e9889ef"}
