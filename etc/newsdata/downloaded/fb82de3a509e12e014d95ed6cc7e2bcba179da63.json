Aboard the rocket was the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft, which, in turn, was carrying the ISS Expedition 61 crew members Jessica Meir of NASA and Oleg Skripochka of Roscosmos, as well as Hazzaa Ali Almansoori of the United Arab Emirates. This launch was notable, as it was well covered by photographers both on the ground and in orbit, as astronauts aboard the ISS were able to look down and capture images of their approaching colleagues as they climbed into the sky, accelerating to approximately 17,000 mph (27,350 kph).", "description": "Photographers on the ground and in orbit captured images of the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft being lifted from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to the International Space Station.", "authors": ["Alan Taylor"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2019/09/iss/i01_80402-1/facebook.jpg?1569521782"}
