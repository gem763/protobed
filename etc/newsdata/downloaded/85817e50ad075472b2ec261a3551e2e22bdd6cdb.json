In Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas\u2014two crazy people decided to commit senseless acts of violence. It was used as fodder for the anti-gun crowd. The 2020 Democratic candidates tried to blame Trump for the El Paso shooting since the shooter was a white supremacist who hated Mexicans while burying the environmentalist roots of the shooter\u2019s manifesto that\u2019s more in line with those on the Left. The El Paso shooter also hated Republicans, but please\u2014blame Trump. My eyes couldn\u2019t roll any harder when that narrative was being tossed around the news cycle.\n\nYet, gun violence occurs every day in blue-state America. Chicago is a prime example. Scores of people are shot and killed on a weekly basis, the holiday weekends in the Windy City especially are brutal. And yet, why no coverage? Well, it\u2019s because the victims are usually minorities. That\u2019s what CNN\u2019s Christian Sierra, the network\u2019s media coordinator told Cary Poarch, the insider who is the basis for James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas investigation into CNN\u2019s liberal bias.\n\nIn clips released by PV, Sierra said, \u201ca white kid gets shot at Princeton University. He\u2019s walking, he\u2019s visiting his big brother who\u2019s a student there, he gets shot in the head. He gets killed. We\u2019re going to get coverage on that because, oh my God, we have to put the precious little white.\u201d When Poarch asked what would happen to three kids shot in Newark, Sierra said nothing would happen, no one would care unless the shooting occurred on Cory Booker\u2019s block.\n\nSierra adds that unless 20 people are shot and killed in urban America, the network would probably take a pass:\n\nIn the second Project Veritas insider video segment covering racial bias and it\u2019s effect on coverage at CNN, Media Coordinator Christian Sierra, states, \u201cI think that shootings in poorer areas or, um, minority communities don\u2019t get as much coverage as if they were to happen in a white area.\u201d [\u2026] \u2026 \u201cI think if, unless if were looking a mass, if you\u2019re a mass shooting like if it were like 20 people killed, they would cover it.\u201d \u201cBut if there were like two people killed, like in a gang related violence shooting, they\u2019re not gonna really care.\u201d\n\nAnd on top of that, cities are run by Democrats, this makes Democrats look bad, and therefore CNN would probably deep-six it. And yet, even with the spikes in violence in cities like Chicago, which has improved in their crime statistics for this year, violent crime across the country remains low, we\u2019re safer than we\u2019ve ever been, and schools are safer than they were during Columbine. We\u2019re not a shooting gallery, but the insane amount of coverage CNN and other networks dole out for mass shooters makes you think we\u2019re like the Bakara Market in Mogadishu. We\u2019re not. But damn the facts if it means putting Trump, the GOP, and the NRA on their heels, or so that goes the logic.", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:48:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/259/763525b1-6817-4b27-aac5-4eaed2007251.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
