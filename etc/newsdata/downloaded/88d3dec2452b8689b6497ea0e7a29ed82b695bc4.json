It is not clear what caused the problem.\n\nWhat many hoped would be a brief closure grew into a shutdown that lasted more than three hours.\n\nSeveral people called for help on social media. Ryan O\u2019Reilly, secretary of the union that represents firefighters at Walt Disney World, said emergency medical workers received phone calls about anxiety attacks.\n\nA Disney World spokeswoman told The Orlando Sentinel that the company was investigating what led to \u201cthe unexpected downtime\u201d, but declined to provide more information.\n\nThe whole gondola system is now shut down, and it is not clear when it will reopen, the newspaper reported.\n\nLive from the Riviera @Disney #Skyliner station.

We started to use the glow stick and notepads to try and calm the kids down.\u201d\n\nThe gondola started moving again after 11pm, Wallace said.\n\nNew York Times\n\nRead more\n\nMother says childless millennials should be banned from Disney World\n\nDisney World theme park visitors warned of rabies outbreak\n\nMan banned from Disney World after flying \u2018keep America great\u2019 sign", "description": "Holidaymakers riding a new aerial gondola system at Walt Disney World in Florida on Saturday night were stranded in the air for several hours after an unknown problem caused some of the gondolas to come to a halt.The Disney Skyliner gondola system launched on 29 September.", "authors": ["Mihir Zaveri"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K5EQzYb09iXLHvm264x5nA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/0bb4944ccf8ca636da8bde9f503a0e40", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
