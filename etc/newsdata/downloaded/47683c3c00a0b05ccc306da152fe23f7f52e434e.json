People can dream, says Anwar", "language": "en", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 24 \u2014 Aspiring to become the prime minister is not wrong but it will continue to be a dream until one commands the majority support of the Parliament, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said in an apparent swipe at Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali.\n\nIn an interview with Turkish broadcaster TRT, the PKR president also revealed that he was never told by Azmin of the latter\u2019s supposed intentions to become the next prime minister.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime for anyone to aspire to become the prime minister but he has to enjoy the support of the majority and I think for now, until the meeting last week among the party leaders, there is no consideration of any other name,\u201d Anwar said.\n\n\u201cPeople can dream, can aspire, but that does not mean that you are going to shake or scuttle the process, and furthermore, it has been duly agreed and signed so you have to then undo this process.\n\n\u201cThere is no attempt or initiative to undo this,\u201d he added in The Newsmakers show while attending the TRT World Forum in Istanbul, Turkey earlier this week.\n\nThe interview was uploaded on YouTube on Tuesday.\n\nAnwar made the remark when asked about the growing speculation that Economics Affairs Minister Azmin can potentially supercede him to the post.\n\nThe Port Dickson MP was then pressed on whether he felt Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad will actually give way to him before the end of Pakatan Harapan\u2019s first term.\n\nHe again replied in the affirmative, and reiterated how there is an agreement that has been signed by party leaders even before the 14th general election.\n\nAnwar also expressed his trust in Dr Mahathir to fulfil his promise of making way, saying their relationship has been built on trust and there has been no indication for him to doubt it.\n\n\u201cBut the issue is not Dr Mahathir or Anwar\u2019s [choice], it\u2019s not my decision, or Dr Mahathir\u2019s personal decision.\n\n\u201cUltimately it\u2019s a decision of the majority of the House of Parliament and that\u2019s what the system says, and as it stands there is no change whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\nAnwar also revealed how it was not too difficult for him to forgive Dr Mahathir following their political fallout in the late 1990s, saying time itself was a remedy that allowed him to heal.\n\n\u201cTime is by itself a reprieve and with my age, I realised that there were so many things to be done than to be stuck with the old anger.\n\n\u201cIt was not difficult, a lot of friends were a bit suspicious that I was just making a politically correct statement to say, well, let bygones be bygones; I said no, it was not too difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nYesterday, Anwar insisted that the Pakatan Harapan leadership council will decide whether or not he is to replace Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad mid-term.\n\nAzmin had on Tuesday come in support of Dr Mahathir serving out a full term as prime minister instead of passing the baton to Anwar as promised.\n\nRelated Articles Azmin: Gig economy will be given emphasis in 12MP Anwar says committed to repealing Sedition Act when he becomes PM Anwar says unaffected by labels, doesn\u2019t care about being called a political Islamist", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 24 \u2014 Aspiring to become the prime minister is not wrong but it will continue to be a dream until one commands the majority support of the Parliament, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said...", "authors": ["Emmanuel Santa Maria Chin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6hSirnYc5e_kOIgIP4minw--~B/aD02Njc7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/1f84d7828909bc433b94af77140ad237", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
