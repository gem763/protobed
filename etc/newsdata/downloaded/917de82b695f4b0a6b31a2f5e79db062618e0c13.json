India Cuts Key Rate for Fifth Time as It Lowers GDP Forecast\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s central bank cut its key interest rate for a fifth straight time this year, moving aggressively to revive economic growth as the banking system faces new stresses.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India lowered its benchmark repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 5.15% on Friday. A majority of the 39 economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted the move, while the rest forecast cuts ranging from 15 basis points to 40 basis points.\n\n\u201cThere is policy space to address these growth concerns by reinvigorating domestic demand,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. The Monetary Policy Committee \u201cdecided to continue with an accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.\u201d\n\nAll members of the six-member Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rate cut. One member voted for a 40 basis point cut, while the others opted for a quarter-point easing. The RBI retained its accommodative policy stance.\n\nGovernor Shaktikanta Das last month alluded to the chance of more easing, given concerns about economic growth. The RBI on Friday lowered its full-year growth forecast for a fourth time to 6.1% from 6.9% previously.\n\nThe benchmark stock index and the rupee pared gains after the decision, while India\u2019s 10-year bonds fell.\n\nCentral banks around the world are loosening monetary policy to offset a global slowdown made worse by U.S.-China trade tensions. Australia cut rates earlier this week for the third time this year, while the Philippines and Indonesia eased policy last month.\n\nGross domestic product rose 5% in the quarter ended June, the weakest pace in six years, and leading indicators tracked by Bloomberg News suggest fairly subdued investment and consumption activity in August.\n\nFriday\u2019s cut takes the benchmark rate to the lowest in almost a decade and follows a number of fiscal steps taken by the government recently to spur growth, including a surprise $20 billion reduction in corporate taxes.\n\n\u201cWhile the recent measures announced by the government are likely to help strengthen private consumption and spur private investment activity, the continuing slowdown warrants intensified efforts to restore the growth momentum,\u201d the central bank said.\n\nThe cut takes the cumulative easing so far this year to 135 basis points, prompting economists to question how much more easing room the RBI has.\n\nThe RBI is also facing mounting problems in the banking system, which could further hurt lending in the economy. It recently imposed withdrawal curbs on a small bank and lending restrictions on another lender. Addressing some of those worries, the RBI said earlier this week the banking system was \u201csafe and stable.\u201d\n\nThe central bank raised its near-term inflation forecast slightly to 3.4% for the second quarter of the fiscal year started April, while projecting the headline number to continue to stay below its medium-term target of 4% -- a level it\u2019s been under for 13 straight months.\n\nThe core measure, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, has been decelerating amid subdued demand.", "description": "India Cuts Key Rate for Fifth Time as It Lowers GDP Forecast", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED8L1F0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
