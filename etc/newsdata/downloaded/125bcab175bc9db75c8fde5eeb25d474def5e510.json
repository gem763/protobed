If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nTeaching can be a thankless job. Late nights grading papers, pressure to meet standards, wrangling overcrowded classrooms\u2014there are a number of reasons that teachers deserve appreciation this holiday season. We polled real teachers for grades K-12, consulted our lists of the best gifts for men and women, and gathered some of our top-tested products to provide plenty of ideas for ways to show you care.\n\nHere are the 25 best gifts for teachers this year:\n\n1. For the teacher who's constantly distracted: Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug (Photo: Ember)\n\nWith more than 20 students in a class, a teacher is lucky to enjoy a cup of coffee or tea when it's actually hot. Instead, they're pulled in a number of directions to answer questions, tie shoes, and hand out assignments\u2014their much-needed caffeine boost cooling down more every minute. With the stainless steel Ember mug, they can keep that cup of coffee set to a specific temperature for hours, adjusting it via their phone as needed, and even receiving reminder notifications of its status within the app.\n\nGet the Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug on Amazon starting at $66.99\n\n2.

For the teacher with a green thumb: The Sill ZZ Plant\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: The Sill ZZ Plant (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nWe fell in love with a ZZ plant from The Sill, an online plant retailer that offers helpful resources and trendy planters, and would recommend it as a low-maintenance gift to anyone on our list. But for a teacher, it's the gift that keeps on giving. It will look attractive on her desk, brightening up the classroom this winter. And when it comes to watering and general care, it becomes a learning opportunity for students. Think of it as the class pet that won't bite.\n\nGet a ZZ plant at The Sill for $44\n\n4. For the teacher who needs a helper: Amazon Echo Dot\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Amazon Echo Dot (Photo: Amazon)\n\nA more compact version of the popular Amazon Echo, the Amazon Echo Dot is a small smart speaker that can be mighty helpful for any classroom. Teachers can ask her to play music, tell jokes, set alarms, set multiple timers, tell stories, spell words, translate, and so much more.

Treat him to the best tea infuser we've ever tested. This Manatea may look cute, but it's tiny fins actually work well to hold the infuser in place while tea steeps. And its silicone body makes it easy to rinse and clean. Throw in our favorite electric kettle, the Hamilton Beach 1.7-liter electric kettle, for the total tea package.\n\nGet the Fred & Friends Manatea Silicone Tea Infuser on Amazon for $8.33\n\n6. For the teacher who drinks a lot of coffee: Hario V60 Ceramic Coffee Dripper\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Hario V60 Ceramic Coffee Dripper (Photo: Reviewed / Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nDon't make your teacher drink old coffee from the teacher's lounge. With our favorite pour-over coffee dripper, they can brew their own cup using high quality beans. We loved the Hario V60 for its extra-large drip hole that made for faster brewing than the other drippers we tested. Want even more java-themed gift ideas? Consider our favorite French press or the best cold brew iced coffee maker we've ever tested.\n\nGet the Hario V60 Ceramic Coffee Dripper on Amazon for $21.50\n\n7. For the teacher who enjoys music: Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nWhether your teacher wants to broadcast an educational podcast, or simply listen to tunes on the weekend, the Anker Soundcore 2 portable speaker is a perfect gift. It's small enough to carry in a backpack, but has a sound quality you'd might expect from a more robust product. Plus, it has reliable Bluetooth connectivity.

For the teacher who packs a lunch: Monbento Original Bento Box\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Monbento Original Bento Box (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nWhile we've dubbed the Coleman 9-Can Soft Cooler our favorite lunch cooler in testing for its utility, we can't help but swoon over the adorable Monbento bento box for packing lunches. Since teachers aren't usually able to head off campus for their midday meal, everyone will appreciate a better way to store their food from home. We love the Monbento for its ability to keep foods separate (even hot and cold foods!) and pack up neatly at the end of the meal.\n\nGet the Monbento Original Bento Box on Amazon for $36\n\n9. For the teacher who stays hydrated: Hydro Flask 18-Ounce Water Bottle\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Hydro Flask (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nTeachers spend most of their days talking to students, a lot of time while also on their feet. Chances are they get a bit parched from time to time. Fortunately, our favorite water bottle can keep water ice cold or coffee piping hot from first bell to dismissal, and its double-walled design will keep condensation from leaking onto that stack of essays on the teacher's desk. Opt for a Hydro Flask in the school colors (and consider personalizing it to go the extra mile).\n\nGet the Hydro Flask 18-Ounce Water Bottle on Amazon for $29.95\n\n10. For the teacher who stands all day: Royal Anti-Fatigue Comfort Mat\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Royal Anti-Fatigue Comfort Mat (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWhen it comes to being on your feet all day, comfortable shoes can only do so much.

This Royal mat was our best value pick after months of testing\u2014it provides tons of cushion and it won't slide around underfoot.\n\nGet the Royal Anti-Fatigue Comfort Mat on Amazon for $29.95\n\n11.

Teachers can use it to interface with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, or set it up to automate lights or other electronics.\n\nGet the eufy Smart Plug on Amazon for $22.99\n\n12. For the teacher who cares about the environment: Hummingbird Glass Straws\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Hummingbird Glass Straws (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nA new set of reusable straws can show your biology teacher you care about her and the environment. Since the overly saturated reusable straw market can be difficult to navigate, we tested a number of top products and found that the Hummingbird glass straws were the best around. They're bent for easy sipping and won't give off any metallic taste as you're drinking. Plus, they're dishwasher-safe and recyclable, earning an A+ in sustainability.\n\nGet the Hummingbird Glass Straws, Set of 4, on Amazon for $19.99\n\n13.

With high-quality ingredients and easy-to-follow instructions, Home Chef is perfect for the busy home cook who still wants to eat healthy. Teachers will appreciate having grocery shopping time back to work on their curriculum.\n\nGet a gift card from Home Chef starting at $60\n\n14. For the teacher who commutes: Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWhen we were testing travel mugs, our tester accidentally left a Zojirushi full of hot coffee in the car overnight and it was still piping hot the next day. So it's ready to go the distance for the teacher who leaves their house at the crack of dawn and still wants hot coffee as a midday pick-me-up. Plus, its sleek design fit into any cupholder, messenger bag, or backpack with ease.\n\nGet the Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug on Amazon for $25.89\n\n15. For the teacher who's always low on battery: RAVPower USB C Battery Pack 20100 Portable Charger\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: RAVPower USB C Battery Pack 20100 Portable Charger (Photo: Reviewed / Michael Desjardin)\n\nWe would argue that any working professional (or person with a smartphone, for that matter) could benefit from a portable charger. There's nothing worse than being without power in the middle of a long commute. But this is especially true for teachers, who may need to recharge several devices. Our favorite USB battery pack features two USB ports and one USB Type-C port, meaning it can even charge some laptops. Plus, it's slim enough to fit into a backpack or purse.\n\nGet the RAVPower USB C Battery Pack 20100 Portable Charger on Amazon starting at $49.99\n\n16.

With our favorite laptop sleeve, at least they can tote their computer in style. In addition to its stylish design, it withstood our assaults with scissors and water, proving that it was as much about function as it was about fashion. There may be cheaper sleeves on the market, but this is one your teacher will cherish for years to come.\n\nGet the Kate Spade 13\" Laptop Sleeve on Amazon for $53.99\n\n18. For the teacher who's running low on essentials: School Supplies\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Puffs Ultra Soft Facial Tissues and Expo Dry Erase Markers (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar; Expo)\n\nWhen we polled teachers about their wish lists for the holidays, school supplies topped every list. Since most teachers have to fund basic classroom necessities out of their own pockets, gifts of dry erase markers like the top-rated Expo brand, and pencils (we hear great things about Ticonderoga) will go a long way. And since no classroom can have too many tissues on hand during cold and flu season, we recommend picking up a pack of our top-tested option, Puffs Ultra Soft.\n\n19. For the teacher who likes capturing special moments: Fujifilm Instax Mini 9 Instant Camera\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Fujifilm Instax Mini 9 Instant Camera (Photo: Fujifilm)\n\nClassrooms may be primarily digital these days, but parents will always appreciate actual photos of their little ones performing in a school play or presenting a project to the class.

Its design makes sure you can still blink while it's on, and its adjustable Velcro strap means it's the perfect fit for every teacher on your list.\n\nGet the Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask on Amazon starting at $10.95\n\n21.

For the teacher who likes accessories: Leather Pouch Wallet\n\nBest gifts for teachers 2019: Madewell Leather Pouch Wallet (Photo: Madewell)\n\nSince many teachers end up carting around tote bags full of gear like laptops, papers to grade, papers that have been graded, lunch boxes, books, and the like, they'll appreciate a way to ditch a purse and keep all their important cards and cash in one pocket-sized place. This leather wallet from Madewell is highly rated for its soft material, and the option to monogram makes it a perfect gift.\n\nGet the Leather Pouch Wallet at Madewell for $29.50; personalization is an additional $10\n\n23.
