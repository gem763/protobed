Happ, the Yankees\u2019 ninth pitcher, to give the Houston Astros a 3-2 win Sunday night that tied the AL Championship Series at one game apiece.\n\nOn a night when starter James Paxton lasted just 2 1/3 innings and 51 pitches, Yankees manager Aaron Boone treated the third inning like he would the sixth during the regular season.\n\n\u201cJust felt like we were covered as far as today with getting some length and having guys rested. Obviously going into an off day tomorrow we\u2019re just going to be aggressive,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThought he was struggling with his command. And it ends up \u2026 doesn\u2019t end well.\u201d\n\nChad Green relieved Paxton with one on and one out, then retired all six batters he faced. The Yankees went ahead 2-1 on Aaron Judge\u2019s two-run homer in the fourth off Justin Verlander, but Adam Ottavino came on with one out in the fifth and George Springer homered on his first pitch, a flat slider.\n\nTommy Kahnle pitched 2 1/3 hitless innings, Zack Britton worked around a one-out walk in the eighth and Aroldis Chapman struck out the side in the ninth around a two-out walk, a taxing inning that took 25 pitches.\n\nSabathia made just the third relief appearance of his career when he entered to start the 10th, falling behind Michael Brantley 3-0 in the count before retiring him on a grounder.\n\nOut of high-leverage relievers, Boone brought in Jonathan Loaisiga, who walked two batters, then was replaced by Happ. The 36-year-old left-hander escaped the jam, striking out rookie Yordan \u00c1lvarez and retiring Yuli Gurriel on a flyout, then tried to elevate a fastball to Correa on his first pitch of the 11th.\n\nHouston had five relievers combine for 4 1/3 innings of one-hit shutout ball after starter Justin Verlander left with the score 2-2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Yankees went to the bullpen early and kept a parade of relievers going to the mound - even CC Sabathia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/alcs_yankees_astros_baseball_97988_c0-193-4632-2895_s1200x700.jpg?73282eae7842558c1fdc1e993a8ba761fb50a373", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
