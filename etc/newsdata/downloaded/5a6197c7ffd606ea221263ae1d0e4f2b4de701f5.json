Yet the iPhone maker debuted it on stage and in advertisements with the slogan, \u201cCreated by Apple, not a bank.\u201d\n\nGoldman\u2019s consumer banking division, Marcus, made several concessions to win the Apple Card mandate. It agreed to scrap late fees and not sell customer data, sacrificing two common revenue streams, the Journal said. It also gave into Apple\u2019s demands to use its signature font on monthly statements and prune them of standard industry language, against the advice of its lawyers, the newspaper reported.\n\nCreating the card was also costly and distracted from other initiatives. Goldman spent about $300 million to build Apple Card, and reassigned thousands of engineers across the company to fix a security vulnerability earlier this year, delaying other Marcus products by months, the Journal reported.\n\nGoldman resisted Apple\u2019s calls to charge all Apple Card customers the same interest rate regardless of their credit score, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. Despite the bank\u2019s role in building the card, Marcus executives were barred from entering Apple\u2019s base of operations \u2013 a Tribeca loft \u2013 ahead of the Apple Card\u2019s launch in August, the Journal reported.", "description": "Business Insider - Goldman conceded to Apple's demands to scrap late fees and not sell customer data, and agreed to use Apple's font, the Wall Street Journal reported..
