He made sure to spend time with him and get him out of the house as much as he could.\n\nHis aunt, Lindsay Holland explained: \"It's something we will never, ever get over.\n\n\"Chad was the rock to the family, he was outgoing, happy. Our family is broken as far as I'm concerned.\n\n\"He was full of life and a proper mammy's boy, he was not shy to say that. They did everything together. He took his mum to the gym, shopping, all sorts.\n\n(Image: MEDIA WALES)\n\n\"He was a handsome boy and always very happy. It's hard, we have had no answers to what actually happened to him.\"\n\nLisa said: \"He was a happy, bubbly character and had a heart of gold. He loved being with his friends and they all loved him.\n\n\"He was one of the most popular boys and would be the first one on the dance floor. He was handsome, all the girls would be after Chad and he would always look after his friends.\n\n\"He was my amazing beautiful boy and my world. He loved being a mammy's boy and was so proud of me. He always spoke so highly of me.\n\n\"He would go and see his grandfather, who he would call 'Daddo' about 10 times a day and in the last five or six weeks before he passed, he got my father out of the house to take him shopping, wheeling him around in his wheelchair, which he enjoyed doing.\"\n\nA special tribute was paid to Chad at the weekend, as 65 members of his family and friends decided to climb Pen Y Fan, in the Brecon Beacons, on Saturday.\n\n(Image: MEDIA WALES)\n\nIt raised more than \u00a3500 for 2 Wish Upon A Star, a charity which supports parents, siblings and other family members affected by the sudden and unexpected death of a child or young adult aged 25 and under.\n\nAll who took part wore t-shirts with his picture emblazoned on them, along with their own special messages such as: \"In loving memory of my boy Chad. Always in my heart.\"\n\nThere was also a balloon release at the top.\n\nChad's aunt Lindsay added: \"It was a very, very emotional day. When we got to Penyfan it was raining, but we were determined whether it was rain, show, thunder or lightening we were going up there.\n\n\"We had children as young as 10 and people in their seventies taking part. Everyone had t-shirts on with Chad's face on it and at the top we left balloons off.\n\n\"We went back to Ferndale Rugby Club for food, and then his local the Maerdy Hotel.\n\n\"We really did not expect all that. We thought there would be seven or eight of us at the most but for all of them to turn out it was emotional for us all.\n\n\"When we got to the top there was a mix of happiness and sadness. It brought a lot of comfort to the family to see how liked he was and how many of his friends made the effort to be there with us.\n\n\"He will always be remembered for the person he was. He was a lovely, caring boy.\"", "description": "Cha Holland, 18, from Maerdy in Wales, had text his mum to tell her he had got home safely before she found his body in the morning", "authors": ["Robert Dalling", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Media Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703626.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MEDIA-WALES-Chad-Holland-01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
