But the Turks say they never agreed to a ceasefire, merely a pause.\n\nMr. Trump declared the U.S. is \"doing very well\" with Turkey, after speaking with Turkey's authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2014 whom he has described as a \"friend\" \u2014 on Friday.\n\n\"It was a lot of, a lot of pain for a couple of days and sometimes you have to go through some pain before you can get a good solution, but the Kurds are very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said Friday in the Roosevelt Room during a last-minute event honoring the first all-female NASA space walk. \"President Erdogan in Turkey is satisfied with it. And we are in a strong position.\"\n\nThe president also said the U.S. has taken control of oil in the region, although it's unclear what he meant by that.\n\n\"We've taken control of the oil in the Middle East, the oil that we're talking about. The oil that everybody was worried about. We have, the U.S. has control of that,\" he said.\n\nThe Kurds were the biggest U.S. ally helping to defeat ISIS in northern Syria. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump ordered U.S. troops to pull out of the region. Shortly after, Turkey invaded, killing hundreds, displacing thousands and allowing ISIS prisoners to escape from detention facilities.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump assured that \"we have ISIS totally under guard. Turkey is also guarding separately; they're watching over everything.\"\n\nIn the last few days, the president has placed the Kurds and Turkey on the same moral plane. Earlier this week, the president repeatedly said the Kurds are \"not angels.\"\n\nOn Friday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Syria is going as planned. No U.S. ground forces, Esper said, will help in the enforcement of the safe zone.\n\n\"The force protection of our service members remains our top priority, and as always, U.S. forces will defend themselves from any threat as we complete our withdrawal from the area,\" Esper said. \"No U.S. ground forces will participate in the enforcement of this safe zone, however, we will remain in communication with both Turkey and the SDF.\"", "description": "The president also claimed the Kurds were \"very happy about the way things are going\"", "authors": ["Kathryn Watson", "Kathryn Watson Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/ff9c9555-8018-4ed3-aff4-fc8e828758b1/thumbnail/1200x630/aa498d17ab02236d3c00cd6aa57676ed/gettyimages-1176485795.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
