He was accused of using the procedural device of \"prorogation\" for political purposes to curtail MPs' ability to scrutinize the government's Brexit plans.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman confirmed at a daily briefing on Monday morning that the suspension, which under the queen's order can begin between Monday and Thursday, would commence on Monday night.\n\nBefore parliament prorogues, the government will hold a vote on whether to hold an early general election. However, opposition MPs have said they will not back the plan, meaning the two-thirds majority required for it to pass will not be met.\n\nAfter Johnson's decision to suspend parliament, MPs acted quickly last week to legislate for a delay to Brexit, beyond the current date of October 31, if no agreement is in place by October 19. That legislation is expected to become law on Monday before parliament is suspended.", "description": "The prime minister is accused of using the procedural device of \u2018prorogation\u2019 to curtail debate on Brexit.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "Naomi O'Leary", "Zosia Wanat"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1173296559-1-1200x628.jpg"}
