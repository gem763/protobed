Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 17 percent. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images 2020 Elections Poll: Biden down 5 points, while Warren edges past Sanders\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s lead in the Democratic primary has been cut in half, according to a new poll out Wednesday, and while Biden still maintains his grip on front-runner status, the CNN poll shows Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders incrementally creeping up on him.\n\nThe CNN poll shows a drop of 5 percentage points in support for Biden in the past three weeks, to 24 percent from 29 percent. The national survey of Democratic primary voters also saw Warren jump Sanders for second place, though the two are still within the margin of sampling error at 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe latest numbers come a little over 24 hours before the top three contenders appear on the same debate stage for the first time in the primary contest. Thursday\u2019s debate in Houston, more specifically, will feature Biden and Warren together for the first time, a dynamic that comes with more scrutiny as Warren continues her steady climb in the polls.\n\nWednesday\u2019s survey shows an increasingly wide gap between the top tier of candidates and the rest of the field, despite three candidates dropping out of the race in recent weeks.\n\nSanders\u2019 17 percent is more than double the next-highest candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, whose poll numbers have largely bottomed out after initially spiking following her takedown of Biden in the first debate. Harris pulled in 8 percent support, followed by another once-rising star, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 6 percent, up from 5 percent for both candidates last month. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke also rose 2 points in the poll, to 5 percent, while the remaining candidates polled at 2 percent or less.\n\nBut despite some erosion of Biden\u2019s lead, the CNN poll also indicates that his campaign\u2019s recent concerted efforts to sell the candidate as the most electable in the primary field might be boosted by voters\u2019 determination to unseat President Donald Trump.\n\nFour in 10 Democratic voters said that they wanted to see their party nominate a presidential candidate they agree with on major issues \u2014 the same as three weeks ago. But a majority, 55 percent, maintained that the party should prioritize nominating whichever candidate has a strong chance of ousting Trump from office.\n\nThe survey found a less drastic split among Democrats when it came to their concerns about the eventual nominee being on the wrong side of the ideological spectrum: Forty-nine percent said they were worried the Democratic nominee would be too liberal, while 41 percent said they feared the party would nominate a candidate who was not liberal enough.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Results from the sample of Democratic voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.", "description": "The latest numbers come a little over 24 hours before the top three contenders appear on the same debate stage for the first time.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5c/ec/a6cb9f0b4abeb85782e03e8f7748/20190910-joe-biden-rallynh-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
