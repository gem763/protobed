He will become the fourth pitcher in MLB history to finish a postseason game and then start the next day, and the first since 1924.\n\nManager AJ Hinch said he didn\u2019t even consider starting ace Gerrit Cole on short rest and feels confident going with Peacock after his solid outing in Game 5.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really good at staying calm in what\u2019s going to be probably one of the more intense games that we\u2019ve had this season up to date,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nThe Yankees also are using a bullpen day and starting reliever Chad Green. The right-hander is 1-0 with a 3.18 ERA in five appearances this postseason. He last pitched in Game 4 on Thursday night, when he allowed two hits and two runs in one inning.\n\nNew York manager Aaron Boone said Green is comfortable in that situation and is throwing the ball well.\n\n\u201cHopefully he\u2019ll give us a little bit of length starting off,\u201d said Boone, anticipating that Green could go through the Astros\u2019 lineup once.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion was back in the Yankees\u2019 lineup as the designed hitter after Stanton went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts as the DH in Game 5 on Friday night after missing the previous three games because of a strained right quadriceps suffered in the ALCS opener a week ago.\n\nBoone said Stanton got through Friday\u2019s game OK, and that the switch was just one of those hard lineup decisions and not because of the lingering injury.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get Edwin back in there. I feel like he\u2019s got a big at-bat in him. I feel the same way about (Stanton) frankly,\u201d Boone said. \u201cToiled over it and decide to keep the infield as it is. \u2026 That was just my decision.\u201d\n\nEncarnacion is 1 for 15 in the ALCS. Stanton was 2 for 4 with a homer in Game 1 against the Astros.\n\n\u201cHe knows there\u2019s potentially a big at-bat off the bench today,\u201d Boone said of Stanton.\n\nPeacock, who has been a starter and also pitched out of the bullpen in his career, was left off the ALDS roster after missing time late in the season with discomfort in his throwing shoulder. Friday was his first appearance since Sept. 29.\n\nHinch said he didn\u2019t know how long Peacock would go. He has a 4.73 ERA in eight career postseason appearances with one start.\n\nPeacock is one of the longest tenured Astros after joining the team in 2013. The 31-year-old pitched in some big games for the Astros during their 2017 championship run. He made four appearances in the 2017 World Series, including pitching two scoreless innings in Houston\u2019s Game 7 win over the Dodgers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as even-keeled as anybody we have,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed him a lot throughout the last month just in how he can be a weapon \u2026 he\u2019s pitched in a lot of different scenarios for us so this moment will not be too big for him. I don\u2019t expect him to be very emotional.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Stephen Hawkins contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Brad Peacock is starting for the Houston Astros in Game 6 as they use a bullpen day to try to close out the AL Championship Series on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/455d78_alcs-astros-yankees-baseball-23686-houston-astros-watch-play-dugout-ninth-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
