Deb Conroy, a Villa Park Democrat, would bar all vaping flavors except menthol, The Chicago Tribune reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a health crisis,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cPeople are dying.\u201d\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker said he supports banning flavored vaping products, which critics contend are marketed at children.\n\n\u201cThere is much more research needed to understand the short and long-term health effects of using e-cigarette products,\u201d Pritzker said in the statement, urging the public to stop usage of e-cigarettes.\n\nNew York and Michigan have already approved bans on flavored products due to growing safety concerns.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently announced that over 500 people throughout the country had been diagnosed with vaping-related breathing illnesses, though the cause remains unknown. Eight deaths have been reported, including one in Illinois. Doctors say the illnesses resemble an inhalation injury. No single vaping product or ingredient has yet been linked to the illnesses, but most patients reported vaping THC, the compound that gives marijuana its high.\n\nIn Illinois, a committee hearing on vaping is planned for Monday in Chicago. Young students who have studied the issue are expected to testify.\n\nIllinois lawmakers\u2019 fall session starts late next month.\n\nLegislators could also take up related proposals.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Grant Wehrli of Naperville wants exceptions on the flavored vaping ban for mint, wintergreen and menthol flavors. He said he doesn\u2019t think they are as \u201cegregious\u201d as other flavors. Another plan sponsored by state Sen. Terry Link, a Vernon Hills Democrat, proposes extending the state\u2019s indoor smoking ban to include e-cigarettes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Illinois lawmakers this fall will consider banning most flavored vaping products, following recent restrictions that some other states have enacted amid concerns about the safety of vaping and its allure to young people.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
