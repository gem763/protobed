HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That\u2019s what I do, Win,\u201d he wrote. \u201cToo Bad!\u201d\n\nThe president concluded his online tantrum by complaining that Fox News was \u201cletting millions of GREAT people down\u201d and that he needs to \u201cstart looking for a new News Outlet\u201d since the one-time \u201cFair & Balanced\u201d channel \u201cisn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately after the president\u2019s tweets, Fox News senior political analyst and former news anchor Brit Hume sounded off: \u201cFox News isn\u2019t supposed to work for you,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHume wasn\u2019t the only conservative Fox star to fire back at the president. Fox News contributor and radio host Guy Benson essentially repeated Hume\u2019s remarks: \u201cWe don\u2019t work for you,\u201d he stated.\n\nFurthermore, Benson also said that Trump was \u201cworking the refs,\u201d agreeing with Axios\u2019 Sara Fischer that Trump was playing to a \u201cfringe culture\u201d of rabid supporters whom the president hopes would help push Fox News to intensify its already largely pro-Trump coverage.\n\nMediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz, a former Daily Beast columnist, also took a mild swing at the president\u2019s criticism, writing, \u201cour job is to cover both sides.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Trump has made it a habit to regularly scorn Fox and make it appear that the network is not sufficiently loyal to him, his administration, or his followers.\n\nMost of these attacks have centered on the so-called \u201cstraight news\u201d division or Fox\u2019s liberal commentators. Brazile, for example, has been a favorite target lately.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s recent attacks haven\u2019t been addressed publicly by network brass, many of the news-centric figures have publicly rebuked the president. For instance, earlier this month when Trump trashed Fox\u2019s polling, telling reporters that \u201cFox has changed\u201d and he\u2019s \u201cnot happy with it,\u201d Special Report anchor Bret Baier said on-air, \u201cFox has not changed. We have a news side and an opinion side. Opinion folks express their opinions. We do polls.\u201d\n\nThis all appears to be part of the president\u2019s ongoing insecurities about the network\u2019s loyalty and subservience to him. This past spring, following Fox News\u2019 highly rated town hall with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, The Daily Beast reported that Trump began telling aides to \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on Fox, expressing concerns that the network would provide even the remotest positive coverage of Democrats.\n\nAnd then last month, The Daily Beast reported, Trump began grilling his closest loyalists and confidants at the network\u2014including primetime star Sean Hannity\u2014asking them all the same question: \u201cWhat the hell is going on at Fox?\"\n\nIn the end, while Trump sweats Fox\u2019s \u201cstraight news\u201d programming and publicly courts other alternatives, those inside Fox News actually feel the president\u2019s repeated attacks are extremely helpful, as it allows them to rebut widespread criticism that the network often acts as \u201cstate media,\u201d especially in light of a constantly revolving door between Fox and the White House.\n\n\u201cEverybody wins,\u201d one Fox opinion-side staffer told The Daily Beast.", "description": "The president on Wednesday morning had a tantrum about the network giving coverage to Democrats.
