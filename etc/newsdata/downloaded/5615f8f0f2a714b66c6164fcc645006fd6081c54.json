It was about raising awareness, and showing people what this market could become. It's the largest meat market in Europe and has been going for about 800 years.\n\n'They used to sell women here and it has evolved with society over time.

Sending solidarity to all workers in this iconic market.'\n\nDr Chris Newton asked what the police were doing to stop the sit-in, describing demonstrators as 'rich, spoilt brats'.\n\nOthers joked it was a bad idea to anger meat traders equipped with meat cleavers in the early hours of the morning.\n\nOne person tweeted: 'Winding up people with knives and meat cleavers at four in the morning is never a good idea.'\n\nMorning breaks over Smithfield Market, one of London's busiest Meat suppliers, as an Extinction Rebellion offshoot Animal Rebellion wake up after a night occupying the space which is usually open from 2am to supply London's wholesale food industries\n\nCity of London police officers are pictured surveying the fruit and veg stalls set up by Animal Rebellion as meat traders look on\n\nA sign that reads 'Super tasty multi-award winning veggies' advertising a plant-based catering service is pictured at Smithfield this morning\n\nAnother said: 'Good luck with that!
