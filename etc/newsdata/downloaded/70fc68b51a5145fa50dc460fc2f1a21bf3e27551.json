The HomePod also acts as a hub for HomeKit, allowing users to remotely monitor all paired smart home gadgets, but as CNET point out, it's cheaper to use Apple TV as a home hub.\n\nApple can count on a few hundred devices that are compatible with HomeKit, however it lags Amazon, which counts 85,000 Alexa-compatible devices, and Google's home ecosystem, which numbers 10,000.\n\nThe job openings Apple lists include a HomeKit partner engineer, a HomeKit protocol engineer, and an embedded firmware engineer for the HomeKit Accessory Developer Kit Software Team, which makes embedded software for HomeKit partners to use in their smart home products.\n\nAnother job for a HomeKit engineer with expertise in computer vision and machine learning notes that Apple is \"developing technologies and crafting experiences that revolutionize the way people get along with the accessories around them.\"\n\nThe smart home push is being led by Andreas Gal, a former Mozilla chief technology officer whose company Silk Labs was acquired by Apple last year. Silk Labs made privacy-focussed AI technology for connecting smart devices. Its engine processes data locally so it doesn't need to go to the cloud \u2014 an approach that fits with Apple's recent privacy messaging around AI on the iPhone.\n\nOverall, Apple's goal appears to be to make it simpler for users to set up smart home products. Amazon is also attempting to solve setup challenges in the home, last month launching the Certified for Humans program, which identifies devices that are \"struggle-free, tinker-free and stress-free\", such as its own Amazon Smart Oven that goes on sale in November.", "description": "Apple hopes to breath new life in its HomeKit smart home initiative and catch up Google and Amazon.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/13/8b75f94c-a9e3-4964-8427-c882389a36f9/thumbnail/770x578/cc862b5e41d737a1d79416a6ae15d4f7/apple-sign-on-storefront.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
