Flames consumed about 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) and destroyed an unknown number of structures, according to the Los Angeles City News Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORIC TOWN EVACUATED\n\nBy Thursday, the Sonoma County blaze had scorched about 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares), Cal Fire said. No injuries have been reported.\n\nGround crews fought the blaze at close range with hand tools and bulldozers, assisted by water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers carrying payloads of fire-retardant slurry.\n\nThe Sonoma County sheriff's office ordered the evacuation of Geyserville, a town of nearly 900 people, founded in the mid-19th century and named for nearby hot springs and geothermal attractions.\n\nA Reuters photographer saw about a dozen homes in flames in the town on Thursday.\n\nBy midday, mandatory evacuation notices covered a total of roughly 2,000 people, the sheriff's office said. An evacuation warning in the northern end of the nearby larger town of Healdsburg, urged residents to be ready to flee at a moment's notice.\n\nBoth towns, about 75 miles (120 km) north of San Francisco, are hubs of upscale restaurants, wine-tasting rooms, inns, and shops surrounded by rolling hills dotted by vineyards.\n\nLarge parts of California were under red-flag alerts this week following forecasts of hot, dry winds blowing into populated areas from deserts to the east.\n\nThe number of homes and workplaces without power could climb to more than 500,000 under worst-case scenarios for precautionary outages this week, according to PG&E, Southern California Edison and other electricity providers.\n\nPG&E said in a statement on Thursday it had shut off power for about 178,000 houses and businesses in northern California during an Oct. 23 public safety power shutoff (PSPS) event.\n\nThe company has restored power to 93% of those customers following announcements that the weather was \"all-clear,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Safety patrols, inspections and power restoration took place throughout the day and continues through the night,\" PG&E said, adding that it expects power to be restored to all customers on Friday, unless any equipment is damaged and needs repair.", "description": "A wind-driven wildfire that forced some 2,000 people to flee homes in Northern California's wine country on Thursday erupted near the base of a damaged high-voltage transmission tower owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Co, utility and fire officials said.
