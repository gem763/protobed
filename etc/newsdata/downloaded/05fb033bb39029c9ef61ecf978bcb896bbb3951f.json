At a town hall meeting in Templeton, most voters instead talked about bolstering corn-based ethanol, preventing mass shootings, and coping with Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nBut Ernst, a target for Democrats looking to take control of the Senate, couldn\u2019t entirely avoid the uproar over Trump\u2019s entreaties to China and Ukraine to help investigate a political competitor.\n\n\u201cWhere is the line?\u201d asked Amy Haskins, a self-described independent and stay-at-home mom from Manning, Iowa. \u201cWhen are you guys going to say, Enough. And stand up and say, I\u2019m not backing any of this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a situation that increasingly will confront many of the GOP senators running for re-election next year as Trump looks to them and their colleagues as a firewall against his removal from office if the Democratic House impeaches him.\n\nNumerous recent polls have shown a shift in public support in favor of an impeachment inquiry of Trump, and his own public remarks suggesting China and Ukraine investigate a Democratic rival, Joe Biden, have only sparked more questions about his presidency.\n\nAt the same time, Biden and the other 18 Democrats running to challenge Trump in 2020 are criss-crossing early primary and caucus states, such as Iowa, and delivering a barrage of criticism of the president.\n\nSome of the most vulnerable Republican senators in 2020, such as Arizona\u2019s Martha McSally, Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner and Susan Collins of Maine, have avoided bringing up the topic of Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nCollins has declined to comment, citing her potential role as a juror in any impeachment trial.\n\nBut GOP lawmakers running for re-election in solid Trump states, such as Senator John Cornyn of Texas, have aggressively defended the president.\n\nErnst says she hasn\u2019t seen real evidence of impeachable conduct by the president, though she separated herself from him a bit.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for him,\u201d she responded when Haskins also asked what she thinks of Trump\u2019s dismissive treatment of past U.S. allies and his embrace of dictators like North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un. \u201cI\u2019ll just say that. I can\u2019t speak for him.\u201d\n\nErnst is favored to win re-election, but her fate next fall could be closely tied to Trump\u2019s. Iowa is a classic swing state in presidential races.\n\nWhile Barack Obama won Iowa in 2008 and 2012, Trump won it by 9 points in 2016. But even before Ukraine and the impeachment inquiry, the president\u2019s popularity had taken a hit in in the Hawkeye State. His net approval rating has declined 18 percentage points there since he took office in January 2017, according to tracking polls by Morning Consult.\n\nThe Ukraine allegations and the impeachment controversy could make that worse, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball election forecast at the University of Virginia. That risks turning Ernst\u2019s race more competitive, he said.\n\n\u201cIf Trump loses Iowa, she\u2019s probably endangered by that,\u201d he said.\n\nOver a two-week congressional break, Ernst is making her regular rounds of the state -- Templeton was her 33rd town hall this year -- providing a window on what\u2019s on the mind of voters.\n\nEconomic Issues\n\nAs angry as Haskins and some other constituents might be, most are focused on other issues, especially those affecting their farm-state economy that\u2019s struggling under trade uncertainty. And many say they are so tired of the partisan controversies during Trump\u2019s presidency that they have stopped paying attention.\n\n\u201cI was in tune with the news and what\u2019s going on with Trump in the first two years, but it got to be a soap opera. So I just kind of shut it out,\u201d said Tim West, an elementary school teacher in Sioux City who said he\u2019s an independent.\n\nA member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s leadership team, Ernst backed Trump immediately after the release last week of a rough transcript of his July phone call with Zelenskiy. In a prepared statement on Sept. 25, she said House Democrats were \u201c determined to impeach\u201d the president, adding that \u201cI\u2019ve looked at the transcript, I don\u2019t see anything there.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Joni Ernst, like most Republican senators running for re-election in 2020, would like to stay focused on the bread-and-butter issues that voters say they care about rather than political fire surrounding President Donald Trump.Many of her Iowa constituents seem to want to avoid the impeachment", "authors": ["Laura Litvan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
