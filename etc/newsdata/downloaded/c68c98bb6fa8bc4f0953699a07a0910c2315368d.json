Photo: Courtesy of TIFF\n\nThe revelation of Morgan Neville\u2019s wonderful 2018 documentary Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? was that Fred \u201cMister\u201d Rogers was exactly who he appeared to be: a man whose chief goal in life was to make every child feel loved. Although he was an ordained Presbyterian minister, he kept doctrine out of his TV show: The enemy wasn\u2019t Satan but a boy or girl\u2019s self-judgment and its attendant despair or cynicism. The gimmick in the new, fictionalized film A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is to pair Mister Rogers (played by Tom Hanks) with a cynic, an Esquire journalist named Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) who\u2019s on assignment for a profile he didn\u2019t ask for and doesn\u2019t want to do. Lloyd doesn\u2019t believe in benevolent patriarchs. The root of his curdled worldview is his fury towards his father (Chris Cooper), who abandoned the family when Lloyd\u2019s mother got sick, and now that anger is disrupting Lloyd\u2019s ability to be present with his wife, Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson), and baby son. What is Mr. Rogers \u2014 the magical Christian \u2014 to do? He gives Lloyd a safe space to show his vulnerability, gently but firmly ushering the journalist into his \u201cneighborhood,\u201d with its primitive puppets and ding-dong choo-choo train. He looks into the camera and tells us kids, \u201cMeet my friend Lloyd.\u201d\n\nIn other hands, this might be a horror movie (It Chapter 3?), but here it\u2019s a ticket to salvation, and it ought to make you roll your eyes \u2014 except that Mr. Rogers had a way of disarming doubters who fell into his orbit, and the film does, too. Leaving the world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, I heard people say, \u201cI actually liked that\u201d \u2014 emphasis on \u201cactually,\u201d as if they couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d gone so soft. But there might be more than softness at work. Watching our nicest Hollywood star playing our nicest-ever children\u2019s show host, you don\u2019t want to look like a sourpuss. There\u2019s peer pressure to succumb.\n\nI actually liked about two-thirds of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood; I got impatient when Mister Rogers receded into the background and the film turned full-time to solving the problems of Lloyd Vogel, who\u2019s based on the magazine writer Tom Junod. It\u2019s not that Lloyd is a drag. He\u2019s just not \u2014 as written here \u2014 that special. But as I write that I feel a twinge of shame. Mister Rogers said everyone was special. One of his weirder lyrics was, \u201cEverybody\u2019s fancy, everybody\u2019s fine. Your body\u2019s fancy and so is mine.\u201d Yes, I know all the songs. As a kid, I even wrote to Mister Rogers to thank him for making me feel less judged, and though I didn\u2019t hear back, I know the message got through because the local PBS station made sure to send me fundraising letters every year. (\u201cMister Rogers tells us you\u2019re a big fan of his!\u201d) Perhaps if he had reached out, I wouldn\u2019t have become so judgmental myself. I wouldn\u2019t have been a critic. Ah, well. In this movie, Mister Rogers reduces Lloyd to a blubbering child and I envied the guy.\n\nDirected by Marielle Heller (Can You Ever Forgive Me?), the movie has a neat visual hook. The cityscapes are cardboard-like, as in Mr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood, and Mr. Rogers introduces the film as Lloyd\u2019s story. He\u2019s the emcee, like Jiminy Cricket. Instead of \u201cWhen You Wish Upon a Star,\u201d he opens with, \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor would you be mine?\u201d while jauntily changing from a sports coat and shoes to a zip-up sweater and sneakers. Hanks\u2019s movements are a little jerkier than the real Fred Rogers, but this isn\u2019t an exact impersonation. It\u2019s Tom Hanks merging his own gentle public persona with Rogers\u2019s, and allowing the teeniest bit of irony to creep in \u2014 as if Rogers sees through Lloyd\u2019s obfuscations. Hanks\u2019s Mr. Roger is a better interviewer than Lloyd. He knows his effect on people. He takes an almost naughty pleasure in stopping his show\u2019s taping for over an hour to play with a visiting boy with autism, and the movie is honestly hilarious when we see Mr. Rogers doing things on camera (messing up the folding of a tent, for example, but refusing to do another take) that no TV host is ever supposed to do. You might even call him subversive. There\u2019s one amazing moment: Lloyd is listening on the phone to Mr. Rogers say, \u201cI want to look through the camera into the eyes of a single child,\u201d and happens to glance out his window to see his father \u2014 eager for a reconciliation \u2014 lurking under the fire escape.\n\nMatthew Rhys\u2019s Lloyd is antsy, high-strung, with no evident equilibrium, but he\u2019s also \u2014 he can\u2019t help it \u2014 rather lovable. I hate to say this (Rhys was peerless on The Americans and proves here that he can hold his own in a movie), but I wish the role had been played by a wilder, more profane actor, a young Jack Nicholson or even an amorphously scuzzy Method man like Joaquin Phoenix. Imagine Joaquin Phoenix assigned to profile Fred Rogers \u2014 that\u2019s funny.\n\nAs Lloyd\u2019s dad, Cooper has some of that scuzziness, but he loses his edge along with everyone else. In its final act, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood slows down and turns maudlin, as if Mr. Rogers had weighed in on the story line. Look, I\u2019m not dumping on Mr. Rogers. I told you I wrote him a fan letter. I cried when he died. I just wouldn\u2019t want him as my script doctor. I do believe that his tender call for respect and forgiveness can induce us to take our first steps on the road to grace, but those are first steps only \u2026\n\nOh, no, I feel his presence:\n\nCan you say hello to my friend David? He\u2019s a film critic. Critics think if they\u2019re too nice, people might think they\u2019re not very smart. But people who are nice are the smartest of all, don\u2019t you think? They would like this movie very much, all the way through. Can you say, \u201cOne of the year\u2019s best?\u201d", "description": "Watching our nicest Hollywood star Tom Hanks playing our nicest-ever children\u2019s host Misters Rogers in Marielle Heller\u2019s A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, you don\u2019t want to look like a sourpuss.
