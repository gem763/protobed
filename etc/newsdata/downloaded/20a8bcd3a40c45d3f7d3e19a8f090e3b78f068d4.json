It now has the opportunity to defend itself or appeal against the charges, before the judges decide whether to send the case to trial. The process could take months.\n\nFCC is now controlled by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, who took a 25% stake in 2014 and gained control of the board in 2016.\n\nDocuments published by the court on Wednesday show its investigation centred on allegations that FCC overcharged for steel in construction projects with a consortium including Brazilian company Odebrecht, using the funds obtained to pay bribes to officials in Panama.\n\nThe High Court said the managers who participated in the scheme were fired by FCC.\n\nIn 2016, Odebrecht agreed to the world's largest-ever corruption leniency fine with prosecutors in Brazil, the United States, and Switzerland, paying at least $3.5 billion. The scandal over bribes for public works contracts spread to other countries where Odebrecht did business, including Peru, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nAt 1325 GMT, FCC shares were down 1.8% at 10.66 euros.
