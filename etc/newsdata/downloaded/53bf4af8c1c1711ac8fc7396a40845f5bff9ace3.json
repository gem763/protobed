Most takeaways major in bold rich flavours and happily there are legions of characterful bottles to match.\n\nGoing spicy? Pick a rich peachy white. Pinot Gris is great, and with chicken tikka masala it\u2019s a masterful match. There\u2019s a dash of Pinot Gris along with Riesling and Gew\u00fcrztraminer in my Aldi wine of the week, which is a triumph with Thai.\n\nReds with fruity depth are the best for hearty take out food \u2013 rogan josh with a Rioja Reserva can work, but keep Chilean Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re in mind for its sumptuous spice.\n\nAnd why not raise the bar? I\u2019ve bought some of the Domaine Vallet Ritou Syrah I\u2019m recommending this week \u2013 it transforms takeaways into banquets.", "description": "These days takeaway food is more varied than ever.
