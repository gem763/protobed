It feels regular, almost boring at this point, to hear a presidential candidate speak vaguely about fighting for the middle class or those in poverty. It is, in part, how President Donald Trump became President Donald Trump\u2014where his opponent trotted out lines about how America was \u201cgreat already,\u201d Trump, mushed in between the racist rants, managed to speak some truth about the present condition of workers.\n\n\u201cOur workers\u2019 loyalty was repaid with betrayal,\u201d he told a crowd of manufacturing laborers in June 2016. \u201cOur politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization\u2014moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.\u201d\n\nThe approach by Sanders and Warren\u2014a universal workers plan, if you will\u2014isn\u2019t new either. North Carolina Senator John Edwards courted the nation\u2019s labor force early and often in his bid for the 2008 ticket. But he didn\u2019t just reserve his time for the major union leaders. He altered his schedule to meet with kitchen workers on their breaks. He listened to delivery workers describe their back-breaking hours. He spoke with hotel workers about low wages. Then he engaged in an extramarital affair and fathered a child behind the back of his cancer-stricken wife, Elizabeth, and the nation was left to choose between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile, in the places that actually matter for workers\u2019s rights, namely state legislatures and federal regulatory boards, an anti-worker movement was underway.\n\n\n\nThe National Labor Relations Boards has been increasingly filled by conservatives with little desire to rebuild labor strength in the United States. A product of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, there are 28 Right-to-Work states and counting; the 2018 Supreme Court decision in Janus v. AFSCME extended similar open-shop abilities to government employees. These are issues that cannot be unilaterally addressed by a single presidential administration. It requires a rejiggering of the entire system: the courts, of Congress, and, the executive branch.\n\nUnions have long been pandered to by politicians. But the current reality is that the path to organizing is a steep hill, filled by management teams with short-term promises for organizing staffs, sometimes followed shortly by threats and eventual firings. In offices and work floors and workspaces across the nation, when at-will employees face discriminatory actions, be it for their gender or race or their subsequent decision to file HR complaints, or stagnant wages, the realistic options for those with families to support and rent and debt payments to make are slim. Without a union representative, the path to obtaining outside legal assistance in the wake of a mistreatment by an employer is unnerving and costly. This leaves workers to either accept their current degrading working conditions or to take their chances on the open job market. Far too often, instead of addressing this universal reality, American politicians have sought to blame workers\u2019 woes on outsourcing, undocumented workers, drugs, or changes in family structures: a response that distinguishes between groups of workers rather than dealing with their shared experience.\n\nRather than setting these people against one another, Sanders\u2019s and Warren\u2019s plans offer a shared vision. By uniting temporary H2A field laborers with the workers on manufacturing floors, and the teachers with the home health aides, Warren and Sanders move past the shallow rhetoric that has defined the Democratic Party\u2019s messaging of recent and into territory that allows for both the unionized and the individual worker to see a hopeful path forward. The policies are not particularly new or fresh in the grand scheme of things, but they don\u2019t need to be. They just need to exist. As history has shown, the workers can take it from there.", "description": "It\u2019s been a while since American laborers\u2014rather than just their union leaders\u2014were properly courted.
