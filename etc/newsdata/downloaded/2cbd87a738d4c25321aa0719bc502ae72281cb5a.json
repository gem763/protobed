It\u2019s China.\n\nThe New START treaty, the last major arms control accord between the world\u2019s two nuclear superpowers, is set to expire in early 2021. Like another key treaty covering intermediate-range nuclear missiles, which collapsed this year after the U.S. quit that accord, Trump administration officials say the agreement may not be worth extending if China isn\u2019t brought into the fold.\n\nA failure to renew or extend the accord would mark the effective end of decades of agreements aimed at limiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Experts say it would also send a worrisome signal to other nations -- from Saudi Arabia to North Korea -- already pursuing or seeking to pursue nuclear programs.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in August that the U.S. should consider \u201cmulti-lateralizing\u201d the agreement. \u201cIf we really want to go after avoiding an arms race, and capture these systems, we should multi-lateralize it.\u201d\n\nYet while the U.S. believes China will double its nuclear stockpile over the next decade, most arms control experts say it would be better for Washington and Moscow to settle on an extension of New START and worry about Beijing later.\n\n\u201cChina doesn\u2019t have anything like the number of warheads the U.S. and Russia possess,\u201d Sam Nunn, a former Democratic senator from North Carolina who co-chairs the Nuclear Threat Initiative, said in an interview. \u201cWe will at some point have to have China in the equation but that won\u2019t happen now. Common sense would be to at least extend a treaty that already exists and work from there.\u201d\n\nRussian officials say they want the current agreement extended for the allowed five years beyond its 2021 expiration. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters last month that that the U.S. continues to insist China be brought into negotiations, a message he said Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered to him at the annual United Nations General Assembly meetings.\n\nBut Moscow says time is running out. Negotiations for a new deal would typically take as long as a year. Even settling on an extension would be lengthy.\n\n\u201cWe urge our American colleagues not to lose time anymore,\u201d Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview with Russia\u2019s International Affairs journal. \u201cThere\u2019s almost none left. Simply letting this treaty die would be unforgivable. This will be perceived by the international community as neglecting one of the key pillars of international security.\u201d\n\nDespite American efforts, Beijing has so far balked at trilateral talks, arguing it is far behind Moscow and Washington, which together hold more than 90% of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cChina has no interest in participating in a nuclear-arms-reduction negotiation with the U.S. or Russia, given the huge gap between China\u2019s nuclear arsenal and those of the U.S. and Russia,\u201d said Fu Cong, director general of the foreign ministry\u2019s Arms Control Department. \u201cThe U.S. and Russia, as the countries possessing the largest and most advanced nuclear arsenals, bear special and primary responsibilities on nuclear disarmament.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s stockpiles are expected to grow rapidly. The country \u201chas developed a new road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, a new multi-warhead version of its silo-based ICBM, and a new submarine-launched ballistic missile,\u201d Lieutenant General Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said in May. \u201cWith its announcement of a new nuclear-capable strategic bomber, China will soon field their own nuclear triad, demonstrating China\u2019s commitment to expanding the role and centrality of nuclear forces in Beijing\u2019s military aspirations.\u201d\n\nGetting China to participate in any talks is complicated by Beijing\u2019s own calculus, which involves deterring India and expanding its weapons program, said Gary Samore, a former U.S. senior director for nonproliferation and export controls during the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cA trilateral approach is not practical at the moment because the Chinese will not agree to institutionalize their very small numbers compared to the U.S. and Russia,\u201d added Samore, who now directs the Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis University.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A key hurdle to extending a landmark nuclear treaty between the U.S. and Russia isn\u2019t Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin.
