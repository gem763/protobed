Patrick Toomey fears that trade uncertainty is contributing to an economic slowdown. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo trade Republicans grow anxious about the Trump economy Trump's trade war with China could undermine GOP chances of holding the White House and Senate in 2020.\n\nRepublicans have sat patiently with President Donald Trump on his tariff roller-coaster ride with China. Now they\u2019re starting to feel queasy.\n\nTrump argues his escalating trade war will force China to the table for a deal. But his ever-rising tariffs \u2014 and his market-rattling tweets \u2014 are increasingly alarming the GOP.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that trade uncertainty is contributing to the slowdown,\u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), a leading free-trader. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very good place. The danger is: Where are we going to be a year from now if concerns about trade continue to be an irritant to growth?\u201d\n\nAsked about Toomey's comments on Fox News Radio Thursday morning, Trump responded: \"What does Pat Toomey want me to do? Does he want me to say 'Let me put my hands up, China ... continue to rip us off?\"\n\n\n\nBut particularly as the global economy cools, key Republicans say new levies on almost all Chinese goods threaten to step on the president\u2019s good news story: A growing economy, rising wages and low unemployment. And that could have outsize effects on Republicans\u2019 tough task of defending the Senate and the White House in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe biggest risk to the economy is the whole trade situation,\u201d added Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in an interview. \u201cI think the president did a great job, we stopped doing the regulatory burden, we have a fairer tax system ... and the whole trade war has injected a huge dose of uncertainty and instability.\u201d\n\nMost Republicans have resisted Trump\u2019s protectionist tendencies for ideological reasons as well as for the hit to the economy and their own political fortunes. But they've made an exception on China given its economic rivalry with the United States. Now his tariff regime on Chinese, European and North American imports have reduced economic growth and increased household costs, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAmid some talk by Trump of new tax cuts to juice the economy, his own political party is cool to the idea. Instead GOP senators are urging the president to conclude new trade deals with Japan and the United Kingdom and intensify the effort to push the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement through Congress.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a former U.S. trade representative. \u201cAnd there\u2019s been some disagreement about that within the administration. Some are saying they should come off and others are saying we should keep them. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get a good agreement if you do that.\u201d\n\nTrump has largely staked his reelection on his economic prowess, so any slowdown could narrow his path back to the White House and undercut the GOP effort to hold the Senate majority.\n\n\u201cAn economy slowing could be a political threat. If you slow down to 1 percent going into the 2020 election, that\u2019s the same thing as a recession politically,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum and a former CBO director. \u201cYou grow at 1.8 percent? You\u2019re back to Obama territory. You can\u2019t survive that.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans up for reelection, \u201cat what point is it better for you separate yourself from the president as opposed to riding his coattails?\u201d Holtz Eakin added.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said the president is merely trying to \u201clevel the playing field for American workers\u201d and played down fears of a slump, citing the current expansion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the president\u2019s polices of fair and reciprocal trade along with lower taxes and deregulation are working,\u201d Deere said.\n\nAny Trump-fueled economic drag will quickly fall on the at-risk GOP senators who hold the keys to the Senate majority. Susan Collins\u2019 Maine has seen lobster sales to China plunging; farmers in Joni Ernst\u2019s Iowa have had a brutal year.\n\n\u201cEveryone acknowledges that the economy is good, but they are still uneasy about their own circumstances,\u201d said one Republican official working on Senate races. \u201cI am nervous that people will lose their patience and want to start seeing results.\u201d\n\nThe GOP is eager to give markets some semblance of certainty, and Republicans are openly brainstorming ways to stabilize the economy. Some are urging the White House to index capital gains to inflation; others are advising a singular focus on passing the USMCA.\n\n\u201cThe biggest risk to the economy is the whole trade situation,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has thus far resisted voting on the new North American trade deal despite support for the pact among some swing-district Democrats. It might not come to the floor at all while Trump is president given Pelosi\u2019s demands to strengthen labor and environmental standards in the agreement.\n\n\u201cIt would be great to get USMCA done this year. But it would not at all surprise me if it happens in the next administration,\u201d said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.).\n\nPelosi previously stalled trade deals under President George W. Bush, but Republicans argue a repeat of those tactics would more difficult with her majority staked in large part on pro-trade Democrats.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an untenable position for them to continue to block it,\u201d Portman said. \u201cUSMCA is practical. At some point, you\u2019ve got to allow people to have a vote.\u201d\n\nCongress has taken some steps to keep the economy humming, raising the debt ceiling and passing a two-year budget deal that will likely help avoid a government shutdown at the end of September. Some Senate Republicans are also eager to pass a long-term transportation bill and members of both parties want to vote on legislation aimed at reducing health care costs.\n\nNo firm decisions about the fall agenda have been made by GOP leaders. Collins said she\u2019s personally asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to make a bipartisan health care package a priority and turn the Senate\u2019s focus toward legislation, rather than nominees.\n\nOthers are diving into the geopolitics of Trump\u2019s conflict with China. Portman is urging White House officials to develop an international coalition to isolate China, while Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) is traveling to China next week to discuss trade with the country\u2019s leaders.\n\nTrump has toggled between calling Chinese President Xi Jinping the \u201cenemy\u201d to showing \u201cgreat respect\u201d for him. He\u2019s ordered U.S. companies to move out of China before backtracking and saying a few days later that he\u2019s likely to \u201chave a deal\u201d with Beijing.\n\nAnd some Republicans say the fight with China is worth the short-term pain.\n\n\u201cDo I like tariffs as a matter of policy on any given day? No. What other alternatives do you have to rebalance what has now been 30 years of cheating, lying, stealing and unfairness on behalf of the Chinese?\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\n\nFor months, Republicans have agreed that Trump is right to take on China even as they opposed his tariffs on allies. But their patience isn\u2019t endless.\n\nSome blame White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who\u2019s pushed a hard-line approach toward China and asserted the economy will remain strong.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Peter Navarro understands the instability of what he promotes. [And what] his trade war, is injecting into the economy,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe worry among free-traders is that China\u2019s one-party system can wait out Trump and avoid political consequences. That\u2019s something that the White House and Republicans simply can\u2019t do with an election 14 months away.\n\n\u201cI give the president credit for confronting China on the very bad behavior they\u2019ve engaged in. I\u2019m not sure these are the best tactics,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cThe Chinese have the capacity to hold out for a very long time.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump's trade war with China could undermine GOP chances of holding the White House and Senate in 2020.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/16/30/e63e94e8488a90d8218dc7bb34c8/190828-toomey-ap-773.jpg"}
