We took a year to let everybody [in the family] take it in and let the dust settle,\" Paltrow told the outlet. \"And now we\u2019re moving in together this month.\"\n\nLater in the article, Paltrow lavished praise on her husband, who she described as being \"a real equal\" who challenges her on a daily basis.\n\n\"I adore my husband. He\u2019s brilliant and deeply kind,\" she says. \"I feel like he\u2019s a real equal too. And he pushes me in the best ways. I really like being married. It\u2019s fun.\"\n\nGWYNETH PALTROW TALKS AGING IN HOLLYWOOD: 'I'VE ALWAYS FELT SO FUNNY ABOUT MY LOOKS'\n\nEarlier this year, Paltrow revealed that Falchuk only stayed at her house on nights and weekends, before heading back to his own home for the rest of the week.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Lifestyle last month, Paltrow said the arrangement sounded \"ideal\" to many of her married friends, and that her intimacy teacher, Micaela Boehm, claimed it would increase \"polarity\" in their relationship.\n\nPaltrow is no stranger to unconventional relationship practices.

The \"Royal Tenenbaums\" actress claimed that having children \"completely\" changed her as a woman.\n\n\"Having children was so extraordinarily profound. It turned my world completely upside down in the best possible way,\" Paltrow told the magazine. \"I think women understand that there are different chapters to our lives. My life looked a lot different in that decade than it did in my 20s, when I was very immersed in acting. In my 30s my focus was my kids.\"\n\nGWYNETH PALTROW LAUNCHES GOOP MEN WITH NOD TO HUSBAND BRAD FALCHUK AND OTHERS WHO INSPIRED BRAND\n\nShe later added, \"I was home most of the time.
