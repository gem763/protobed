How Caitlin Doughty teaches kids about death", "language": "en", "text": "When faced with the question \u201cwhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d, very few kids would answer \u201cundertaker\u201d. Caitlin Doughty, perhaps most famous for her YouTube channel Ask a Mortician, certainly wouldn\u2019t have. \u201cI never had any sense of the funeral industry as anything other than this dark, archaic hole with a man in a suit putting electric green fluid through a tube into a corpse. It never even occurred to me that I could be a part of it,\u201d she says.\n\nBut maybe that is about to change. Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? answers 35 questions about death, sourced from curious children. From \u201cWill I poop when I die?\u201d to \u201cCan I use bones from a human cremation as jewellery?\u201d, it gets down to the morbid questions we all have \u2013 asked by children unburdened by shame. \u201cThe kids make it clear that we\u2019re not being direct enough in how we talk about death,\u201d Doughty says. \u201cI think that a lot of adults never really got the kind of death education that they need.\u201d She compares the silence about death to the reticence around sex: \u201cMy parents weren\u2019t necessarily talking about it, but I was watching porn at my friend\u2019s house when I was nine because her older brother had it. There\u2019s always going to be these things slipping in somehow.\u201d\n\nTo the uninitiated, Doughty\u2019s work, unsurprisingly, sounds a little morbid. She has written two other books about death: her 2014 memoir Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, and 2018\u2019s From Here to Eternity, about death rituals around the world. On her YouTube channel, where you\u2019ll find videos including \u201cCan I become mummified?\u201d and \u201cCorpse phallus capers of Rasputin and Napoleon\u201d, she\u2019s been answering questions from curious adults for seven years. But lifting the lid on that antic Pandora\u2019s box, reveals a very admirable personal aim; to dispel the west\u2019s fear of death.\n\nAfter attending mortuary school in San Francisco, Doughty, then 22, started working in a crematorium. It was not something she expected to become her life\u2019s work. \u201cI kind of thought it would be a cool story to tell at a dinner party when I\u2019m 45,\u201d she laughs. But she took to it quickly, and found her mission on the way.\n\n\u201cWhen I started to learn about the commodification of death and the death industry in the western world, I realised we had something taken from us as a culture,\u201d she says. For From Here to Eternity, she travelled the world to observe different cultures\u2019 death rituals; the book is both sensitive and light, and thoroughly researched, written by an author who genuinely wanted to learn from, not fetishise, other customs. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem in the US and the UK that we just suck our immigrant cultures up into our cookie-cutter, bland death rituals. Forcing them to leave behind rituals and ways of doing things that are really important to them,\u201d she says.\n\nTurning grief into healthy grief is not a disservice to the person who died, even if it was someone incredibly close to you Caitlin Doughty\n\nIn 2011, Doughty founded The Order of the Good Death, a \u201cdeath acceptance\u201d collective that aims to educate people on better ways to handle dying. From there, she started Ask a Mortician to answer people\u2019s questions about death. As well as the kookier queries, her videos also include \u201cHelping a Friend Through Grief\u201d and \u201cOvercoming Death Denial in Your Family\u201d. She advocates for the family caring for the bodies of loved ones, and has found that \u201cpeople instinctively want to be more involved, they just need an expert to say go for it.\u201d In 2015 she opened Undertaking LA, an \u201calternative\u201d funeral home in Los Angeles that focused on being more affordable and getting the family involved (a new branch is about to open).\n\nShe has been building up to Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? for years, with videos such as \u201cIt Gets Better, Morbid Kids!\u201d While the idea might send shivers up some parents\u2019 spines, she says adults shouldn\u2019t shut down children\u2019s questions. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re terrified that something you say is going to set off some deep death fear in them. Say it honestly, tell them \u2018If something is bugging you, or you want to keep talking, I\u2019m always happy to talk to you about this\u2019,\u201d she says. She wishes more adults would give children information early on, so that when they inevitably encounter death, \u201cthey\u2019re already used to talking about it, used to the more fun, interesting, curious parts.\u201d She believes it\u2019s possible, through science and humour, to train the brain \u201cto see death as simultaneously very heavy and a source of great curiosity\u201d.\n\nAs a child, Doughty learned about death violently when she saw another child fall in a shopping mall (\u201ca complete aberration\u201d). Afterwards, she developed OCD symptoms including tapping and compulsive spitting. \u201cMy brain was being invaded with the knowledge of death and the fact that people could be taken away from me at any moment and I couldn\u2019t control it. All I could control were these little rituals.\u201d\n\nLike Doughty, my early relationship with death also manifested through OCD. Once I learned that people could be taken away, I started trying to regain control through repetitive actions. That obsession has only intensified as I\u2019ve got older, but the work of Doughty and other death-acceptance advocates has helped quell my fears. \u201cI have never gotten a message that said \u2018I watched your videos and it made it worse for me. I\u2019m more anxious now, I\u2019m more obsessive compulsive,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily like it when I use the word \u2018control\u2019, but I personally like it because I think that\u2019s what happened to me. The feeling of empowering myself to know the reality. That truth did set me free, in a way, and made me feel better. It still makes me feel better about the fact that we will all die.\u201d\n\nNot everyone feels the same. Some people find comfort in denial. Doughty\u2019s humorous and transparent approach can be controversial, with some of her viewers and readers criticising her for not discussing grief enough. But she\u2019s anything but insensitive, and knows better than anyone about the impact of losing someone: \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be the same again. But how can we turn this into something healthy as opposed to something else? Turning grief into healthy grief is not a disservice to the person who died, even if it was someone incredibly close to you. It\u2019s not a disservice to mourn them in a healthy, open way. You\u2019re never going to get over it, no matter what, but you remember the experience with a sort of melancholic, whimsical engagement. You can really do the work, or you can just remember it as a source of deep trauma. You\u2019re going to remember it one way or the other \u2013 so what is that going to look like?\u201d\n\nNobody likes to think about mortality, but if you\u2019re going to, there are far worse places to start than Doughty. Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? is funny, dark, and at times stunningly existential, revealing not only how little we understand about death, but also how much kids can handle. As to whether or not your cat will eat your eyeballs? You\u2019ll just have to read the book to find out.\n\n\u2022 Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?
