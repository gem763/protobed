Warnings for areas north of the capital began to be lifted by Sunday morning.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis was expected to head out to sea on Sunday evening after churning its way up the northern island of Hokkaido.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe convened emergency meeting of relevant ministers and dispatched the minister in charge of disaster management to the worst-hit areas. He offered condolences to the families of those who died and said the government was working to save people\u2019s lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe government will do everything in its power to cooperate with relevant agencies to restore services as soon as possible,\u201d said Abe. The government has also set up a taskforce to deal with the damage, NHK reported.\n\nTen people were killed in areas including the Chiba, Gunma, Kanagawa and Fukushima prefectures surrounding Tokyo, NHK said. Among them was a man in his 60s who was found in a flooded apartment in Kawasaki, it said.\n\nSixteen people were also missing on Sunday, it said, adding that the full extent of the damage was only beginning to emerge because it was widespread and many areas were still under water.\n\nSome 425,000 homes were without power, the government said, reviving fears of a repeat of the weeks-long power outages suffered after another typhoon hit east of Tokyo last month.\n\nIn Fukushima, north of the capital, Tokyo Electric Power Co (9501.T) reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overnight. The plant was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nNHK showed swathes of low-lying residential areas inundated in parts of central and eastern Japan by overflowing rivers, with some of the worst damage caused by Chikuma river in central Japan\u2019s Nagano prefecture.\n\nRelated Coverage Japan cancels maritime fleet review after typhoon: spokesman\n\nNHK showed military helicopters airlifting stranded residents from homes near the river, after they got trapped by massive quantities of brown water reaching the hooves of their houses.

The buzz of rescue helicopters and wailing of fire engine sirens was the main remainder that emergency services were still working to help the residents.\n\nAuthorities issued evacuation advisor and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Some 126 injuries have been reported so far, NHK said.\n\nRESUMING OPERATIONS\n\nThe storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nHagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday evening. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook Tokyo shortly after.\n\nShinkansen bullet trains from Tokyo would begin on schedule Sunday with the exception of some services to the most affected parts of the country, NHK said, while the Tokyo subway system was also operating.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency had issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of the potential for once-in-decades rain totals, but lifted them early on Sunday.\n\nJust last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages.\n\nThe capital\u2019s main airports, Haneda and Narita, stopped flights from landing and connecting trains were suspended, forcing the cancellation of more than a thousand flights.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nJapan has canceled a maritime fleet review planned for Monday, a spokesman for the Maritime Self-Defence Force said, after a fierce typhoon pounded Tokyo and surrounding regions over the weekend, causing flooding and widespread power outages.\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi on Sunday was canceled, although the crucial Japan-Scotland match was set to go ahead.
