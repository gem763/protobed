By the time I come back, there will not have been enough time to do a proper canvass and campaign.\u201d\n\nMSIMANGA EYED FOR FEDERAL CHAIR\n\nFormer Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga, who vied for the post of federal chair and lost to Trollip at last year\u2019s congress, has been touted for the position of interim federal chair.\n\nMsimanga said that he had not been formally lobbied for any position.\n\n\u201cIt is something that at the moment I am not looking at. I think I have got too much on my plate to even be available for an internal position. And I do not know whether for me, personally, it is a good time to be standing for any position within the party.\u201d\n\nIt is also very likely that the position of federal chairperson will cease to exist if the recommendations of the review panel to do so are adopted at the policy congress.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, whoever gets it will know that it is only for a few months,\u201d said a source in the DA.\n\nMAIMANE\u2019S DRAMATIC FINAL HOURS\n\nMaimane\u2019s resignation hit his allies hard, and although they were expecting it, most are seemingly struggling to regroup and strategise.\n\nThey added, however, that there was no time to waste and that the group should be planning their next move.\n\nRead: Maimane also resigns as parliamentary leader and DA member\n\nMaimane had for weeks told those close to him that he would walk if Zille emerged victorious as federal council chairperson.\n\nAccording to those who attended the federal executive meeting last week, the party\u2019s top brass spent hours trying to convince both Maimane and Trollip to stay, but they failed.\n\n\u201cThe two were even given a brief adjournment to reconsider, but their minds had been made up,\u201d said an insider.\n\nA provincial leader told City Press that when concerned members of the party asked Maimane on Wednesday morning about the rumours of his resignation, he was rather evasive.\n\n\u201cHe just said that there was a press conference organised for 1pm. We asked whether we could get a briefing on what the press conference was about, but he was uncomfortable to answer this question, or rather reluctant to answer, which automatically meant that the rumours were true,\u201d said the leader.\n\nHe did, however, officially tell council members in the meeting that morning of his firm decision.\n\nEven a two-hour private conversation which he had with federal council leader Zille was not enough to change his mind.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when they disappeared for two hours, privately, in the building. There was a time when an announcement was made during the federal executive meeting that Mmusi was resigning. Then Trollip said he would also be resigning,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cWe literally begged them and asked that they not leave. It was traumatic for the party because that was not something we could anticipate.\u201d\n\nThe party was hoping that both Maimane and Trollip would delay their resignations until the early congress projected for April.\n\nMeanwhile, Mashaba has played down talk that he and the departed leaders are plotting a new party.\n\nMashaba said he had \u201cno interest in that and people are just making it up\u201d.\n\nHe said he would be taking a break to decide what to do next.\n\nA provincial leader told City Press that he believed Steenhuisen would most likely be the new leader if he was nominated in the upcoming special congress.\n\n\u201cI think Steenhuisen is a strong candidate and I think he will be able to pull it off. I think his credentials in Parliament can be a testament that he has done very well. If it does happen that Steenhuisen is elected, he will be able to the carry the position well.\u201d\n\nRead: Mmusi Maimane was once SA\u2019s most favoured political leader\n\nIn the same breath, the provincial leader expressed concern regarding the upcoming elections and whether black voters would still see the DA as a viable option.\n\n\u201cMmusi was trying his level best to attract the black vote and I think he has managed to a large extent, but not at the level we actually wanted.\n\n\u201cNow what worries me is that in the market we are trying to break into, the black market, we may run the risk of people becoming a little bit unsure \u2013 because the trust factor in politics is important.\n\n\u201cWhat is going to happen when we start campaigning in the black areas \u2013 how are the voters going to accept us?\u201d", "description": "Intense behind-the-scenes lobbying has begun for the top leadership positions in the division-wracked DA, with at least four leaders being pushed to take over from Mmusi Maimane.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele", "Queenin Masuabi", "Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8943/006b6305dd014c60bc039dddf6d7cdab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
