This could be reverted by reverting all chain activity since the hack and doing a DAO-style HF to recover the funds,\u201d he wrote.\n\nContinuing, he asked how many coins would need to be stolen in order for followers to support manual reversal.\n\nThe survey appeared to touch a nerve among commentators. Ethically, they argued, the amount of money should not matter \u2014 rolling back transactions removes the benefits of a blockchain without centralized control.\n\n\u201cFailchain,\u201d popular Bitcoin pundit Dennis Parker summarized.\n\nDead against intervention\n\nCorrespondingly, more than 60% of the over 10,000 responses to the survey confirmed they would not tolerate remedial measures under any circumstances.\n\nEthereum developers have reversed transactions before, notably following the notorious Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, hack in June 2016, which lost Ether (ETH) worth $60 million at the time.\n\nEthereum is currently undergoing a major transformation in a long-term upgrade which will ultimately even see it change its algorithm. The changes will help resolve some of the network\u2019s growing pains - in August, Buterin warned its blockchain was almost full.\n\nThe largest altcoin by market cap, ETH has nonetheless fared underwhelmingly this year as Bitcoin (BTC) cements its position at the top.", "description": "A survey by co-founder Vitalik Buterin drew more ire than feedback, with Twitter users berating him for even suggesting devs could intervene in smart contracts", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy83Zjg0M2MzN2MxYjc4MDcwNWMwYzgyNjRlMjY1MmZmNi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
