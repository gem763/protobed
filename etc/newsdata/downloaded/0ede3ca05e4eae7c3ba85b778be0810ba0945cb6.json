It says it still plans to complete it this year.\n\n\"The We Company is looking forward to our upcoming IPO, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year,\" WeWork told Markets Insider in a statement. \"We want to thank all of our employees, members, and partners for their ongoing commitment.\"\n\nThe group's largest investor, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, discussed kicking in $750 million to $1 billion to support the IPO, the sources told Reuters. WeWork, however, reportedly determined that a listing would have raised little more than $2 billion even with SoftBank's help. That would be short of the $3 billion it needs to unlock a $6 billion credit line. The bank financing is also contingent on an IPO by the end of this year.\n\nWeWork has faced growing concerns about its path to profitability, the sustainability of its business model, and its corporate governance. The doubts have led the company to slash its targeted public valuation to as low as $10 billion to $12 billion, according to Reuters, a far cry from the $47 billion private valuation it secured in January.\n\nThe group reported a net loss of about $1.6 billion last year, almost matching its roughly $1.8 billion in revenue. Its strategy \u2014 signing long-term leases for properties and then dividing them up, renovating them, and offering short-term rentals \u2014 could suffer during an economic downturn.\n\nCEO Adam Neumann's control of WeWork, large stock sales, property deals, and family members' involvement in the business have also raised flags, leading the group to announce sweeping changes to its governance last week.", "description": "WeWork has delayed its IPO, according to Reuters.
