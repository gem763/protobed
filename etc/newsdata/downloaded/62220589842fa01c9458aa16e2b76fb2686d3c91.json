But I looked at it and said to them, congratulations you've found something more substantial.\n\n\"It just seemed too good to be true in the presentation that I was compelled to go visit as soon as possible. I don't like waiting to find out if i like something or not.\"\n\nKumova was on a plane to Utah a week later with long-time confidant Tom Eadie, a former general manager of exploration at former zinc giant Pasminco, and was startled by what he saw.\n\n\"They were sitting on this copper deposit. Literally you could see the blue rocks on the surface. You usually have to go something like 500 metres deep to see it, but there it was. So I picked up a rock and kissed it, that was how happy I was.\"\n\nKumova emerged as a 15 per cent shareholder in Alderan when it floated on the ASX in June at 20\u00a2 per share. The stock has surged 400 per cent since, with investors betting on its copper resources as part of a wider play for minerals that are used in batteries - a similar story that Kumova oversaw at Syrah with its graphite resources.\n\nAlderan is one of a string of successful investments Kumova has made in recent months. He says he wants to invest in companies that have \"great assets with great people you want to back over the long-term\" but is also conscious of the following he has developed among small and micro cap mining investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You do the due diligence but it's your own money and reputation in there. But I think the benefits far outweigh the risks and while there's never any guarantees the ones I've got in I think you've got you be unlucky for them not to work.\n\nTolga Kumova in Utah, where Alderan Resources has a copper mine Supplied\n\nA month after the Alderan float, Kumova in July joined the board of New Century Resources as corporate director (Eadie also became a director), and emerged with about 17 million shares and options over another 30 million.\n\nNew Century shares have since surged more than 630 per cent, with excitement building over its century zinc project in north-west Queensland as the price of the commodity rises, though it took New Century director Evan Cranston three attempts to entice Kumova to invest. \"I eventually said I'd put $2.5 million of my own money into the company and get options as well to help them develop the asset. They agreed.\"\n\nThe company's shares were up 10 per cent alone to about $1.58 on Wednesday after a Deutsche Bank analyst report revealed a 12-month price target of $2.40.\n\nKumova's travels during the past year have also taken him to Slovakia with European Cobalt, of which he became non-executive chairman of in May. The company's shares are up 209 per cent since. Kumova has about 32 million direct shares in the stock, which has been trading at about 20\u00a2, and another 30 million options which are already in the money.\n\n\"This is again part of the thematic...of supplying the battery industry,\" says Kumova of European Cobalt, which has a high grade cobalt, copper and nickel mine in central Slovakia, where Kumova claims the mine has boosted local employment. \"You have to think about the local region, after all what you've got basically is the right to market their soil so why shouldn't they benefit.\"\n\nKumova is also a substantial shareholder in Hill End Gold, to which he and Eadie sold a alumina project near Ballarat in mid-July. Their private Pure Alumina Pty Ltd was paid $100,000 and issued 8 million shares in the deal and will be issued another 20 million shares after the completion of a feasibility study on the mine, which has kaolin deposits. HEG shares are up 340 per cent this year and 111 per cent since the deal was announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there is Draig Resources, which holds the Bellevue gold project in Western Australia. Kumova had previously bought shares and reportedly was part of a placement in August that raised $3.3 million from sophisticated investor. Draig shares are up about 355 per cent since January 1.\n\nKumova in May also emerged with a 6.78 per cent stake in Meteoric Resources, which has a cobalt project in the Canadian province of Ontario. Meteoric shares have surged 540 per cent since.\n\nEven stock in Syrah, of which Kumova still has about 13 million shares, has recovered since his departure. Syrah shares up are up about 20 per cent since January 1.\n\n* The 2017 Financial Review Young Rich list is published on Friday in The Australian Financial Review Magazine and at afr.com", "description": "How Young Rich Lister Tolga Kumova found six hot small mining stocks that have surged up to 600 per cent this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_620%2C$height_414/t_crop_fill/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0a146c5d37895b4fd9c9080e79b1c74eba502f01", "published_at": "2017-10-24"}
