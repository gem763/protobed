All that\u2019s needed is a receipt for proof of purchase, which can be uploaded to thewinningwaffle.com\n\nIn an interview with FOXBusiness.com, White Castle Vice President Jamie Richardson said, \u201cWe think that customers who love the Castle here should be able to see a different kind of castle. We [also] think there\u2019s something magical about every trip to White Castle and we want to be able to reward one lucky customer with a chance to get over to Belgium.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhy not go to where the waffle was made famous?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to sales, Richardson said the Belgian Waffle Slider lineup was a limited-time item in 2018, but demand was so high, White Castle decided to add it to the everyday menu. He also pointed out that White Castle\u2019s expanding breakfast menu and all-day availability has greatly contributed to profits.\n\n\u201cBecause we have smaller sandwiches, it\u2019s not all or nothing at the Castle. Customers have room to explore their taste preferences and what feels right at the moment,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cSo, you get that breakfast waffle sandwich along with a double cheese slider or whatever else you want. Morning, afternoon or night, we think it gives more opportunity or choice.\u201d\n\nThis tactic he explained, really connects with millennial and Gen Z customers. In his own words, \u201cWhat they crave most is convenience and flexibility.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledged that breakfast menu expansion makes White Castle competitive with other big names in the fast-food industry.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, we started with four menu items in 1921. Today, customers want more and we also find that they\u2019re craving different tastes,\u201d Richardson explained.\n\nFor the Belgian Waffle Slider lineup in particular, it has been strategically priced to remain competitive. At most White Castle franchises, customers can get two of these sliders for $3. The logic behind this according to Richardson, is that it extends a good deal to customers and allows them to try something new without a big risk.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to take out a second mortgage on your home to enjoy a great sandwich,\u201d he said jokingly.\n\nIn a world where fast food establishments are trying to capitalize on breakfast -- NPD Group data reports that morning meal traffic has increased 3% to 5% since 2013 -- White Castle isn\u2019t alone in its love for waffles. Last week, Burger King introduced a Mapple Waffle Breakfast Sandwich and days before that Tim Hortons released a Blueberry Waffle Breakfast Sandwich.\n\nEven Taco Bell tried a waffle taco in 2014 until it was subsequently replaced by a biscuit. Dunkin\u2019 dabbled in limited-edition waffle sandwiches for National Waffle Day in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, if fast food breakfast is not to your liking the frozen waffle market is shown to be a growing field in the breakfast category as a whole. According to a report in Business Wire, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett\u2019s financial servicing company Berkshire Hathaway, the global frozen waffle market is expected to reach a compounded annual growth rate of over 5% from 2018 to 2022.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "White Castle Vice President Jamie Richardson says the Belgian Waffle Slider is so popular that the fast food chain wants to give back to their dedicated base.
