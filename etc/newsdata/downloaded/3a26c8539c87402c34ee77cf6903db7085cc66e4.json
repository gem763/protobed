Bernie Sanders that so much wealth for one person shouldn't exist.\n\nZuckerberg, who is the fifth richest person in the world, said he agreed with Sanders.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the comments about billionaires during a Q&A livestream on the social media platform with employees on Thursday\n\n'I understand where he's coming from,' he said.\n\n'I don't know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level no one deserves to have that much money.'\n\nSanders announced last month a plan to tax the nation's wealthiest households, saying it will generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade and substantially reduce billionaires' fortunes.\n\nThe plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for $10 billion-plus fortunes.\n\n'We are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy,' Sanders said at the time.\n\nSanders has also previously vowed to clamp down on media mergers and toughen enforcement of antitrust laws against tech giants like Facebook and Google.\n\nHis take on billionaires came after he was asked to respond to recent comments made by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders that so much wealth for one person shouldn't exist\n\nIt comes just days after audio of two internal Facebook company meetings from July were published by The Verge in which Zuckerberg told employees that Sanders' rival, Elizabeth Warren, becoming president would be bad for tech.\n\nZuckerberg said the company would 'go to the mat' to defeat Warren's expected effort to break up the world's largest social media company if she were elected president.\n\n'If she (Warren) gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,' he said, according to the leaked audio.\n\nWarren, who in March called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc , Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc, quickly issued a retort on Twitter.\n\n'What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights,' Warren tweeted.\n\nIn a later series of tweets, Warren noted that Facebook has built more market dominance in recent years by acquiring potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nDemocratic 2020 contender and Senator Elizabeth Warren accused tech giants of participating in 'illegal anticompetitive practices' after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would 'fight' her on trying to break up big tech\n\n'More than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook,' she wrote. 'They've got a lot of power-and face little competition or accountability.\n\n'They\u00b4ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.'\n\nIn the audio, Zuckerberg said breaking up big tech companies would make election interference 'more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together.'\n\nZuckerberg also drew laughter by saying Facebook's investment on safety is bigger than Twitter's entire revenue.\n\nDuring his livestream on Thursday, Zuckerberg said he would 'try not to antagonize' Warren even further.\n\n'Sure, I may have said it in more of an unfiltered way, but fundamentally we believe in everything that was in there,' he said of the leaked recordings. 'At this point, I do such a bad job at interviews, it's like, 'What do we have to lose?'", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the comments about billionaires during a Q&A Facebook livestream with employees on Thursday.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/15/19299740-0-image-a-163_1570198135853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
