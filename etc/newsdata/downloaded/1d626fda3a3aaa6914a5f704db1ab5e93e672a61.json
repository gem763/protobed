When he had the ball, Mahomes was mostly ineffective thanks to relentless pressure from the Indianapolis defense and a left ankle injury that appeared to limit his mobility.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOld-school football tops NFL\u2019s most dynamic offense\n\nIt was a victory for Frank Reich\u2019s throwback, grind-it-out football over Andy Reid\u2019s high-octane offensive attack led by the game\u2019s most dynamic young quarterback and defending league MVP.\n\nIndianapolis ran the ball 45 times for 180 yards and held the ball for 37 minutes compared to Kansas City\u2019s 23. When the Chiefs had the ball, the Colts were constantly on attack, sacking Mahomes four times for a loss of 33 yards. Prior to Sunday, Mahomes had been sacked just three times in four games.\n\nThe Colts showed the best way to beat the Chiefs is to keep the ball out of Patrick Mahomes' hands and keep pressure. (Getty)\n\nThe decisive sequence of the game wasn\u2019t a potent display of offense from the Colts, but an example of precise execution of a gameplan to limit the effectiveness of juggernaut Chiefs offense.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nHolding a 13-10 lead with 2:30 remaining in the third quarter, the Colts elected to punt on fourth-and-seven from Kansas City\u2019s 41-yard line.\n\nMahomes tweaks ankle\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Chiefs took over at their own five-yard line. Two Mahomes incompletions and a Damien Williams run for no gain later, and the Chiefs were forced to punt out of their own end zone. At the end of the drive, Mahomes limped off the field after having his already-taped left ankle stepped on by a teammate during his third-down drop back.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened to Patrick Mahomes\u2019 ankle on that last drive: pic.twitter.com/OaSnu94DLC \u2014 Terez A. Paylor (@TerezPaylor) October 7, 2019\n\nMahomes initially twisted the ankle during the first half \u2014 the same ankle that forced him to miss some plays in Kansas City\u2019s season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nColts dominate ball late\n\nWhat the Colts did next wasn\u2019t pretty. But it was effective. After taking over on the punt at the Kansas City 48-yard line, Indianapolis ran 14 plays for 35 yards, eating 8:34 off the clock. The drive didn\u2019t end in a touchdown, but an Adam Vinatieri field goal to take a 16-10 lead with 7:43 remaining.\n\nThe Indianapolis defense did its job once again on the next Chiefs possession that gained eight yards on five plays and ended with former Justin Houston stuffing Williams in the backfield on fourth-and-one at Kansas City\u2019s 34-yard line in a certainly satisfying moment for the former Chief who was cut this spring in a salary dump despite being one of the league\u2019s most effective pass rushers.\n\nBIG fourth down stop for the @Colts defense!\n\n\n\nIndy takes over on downs. #Colts\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #INDvsKC on NBC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app\n\nWatch free on mobile: https://t.co/ZqkGgcuCUY pic.twitter.com/jj7Ho9SMWz \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like the way things ended when I left here,\u201d Houston told NBC after the game. \u201cTo come back and get a win, it mans so much to me.\u201d\n\nHouston ended the night with four tackles, a sack and the biggest defensive play of the game.\n\nThe Colts scored another Vinatieri field goal on their ensuing possession for a two-possession lead that proved too much for Mahomes and the Chiefs to overcome on a last-ditch drive that ended in a field goal. When their onside kick failed, the game was over.\n\nMack outshines Mahomes\n\nMarlon Mack was a frequent star of the Colts grinding game plan, running 29 times for 132 yards behind a bullying offensive line. The Chiefs, by comparison, gained just 36 total rushing yards on 14 attempts the entire game.\n\nMahomes finished the game completing 22-of-39 pass attempts for 321 yards with a touchdown and no turnovers. He opened the game with a few of the trademark plays that made him the NFL MVP last season, including a remarkable 27-yard touchdown pass to Byron Pringle after escaping pressure form the Colts front four. He threw for 130 yards in the first quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to attribute how much his ankle bothered him and how much of his play was strictly due to the Colts defense, but he was largely ineffective after halftime.\n\nWith the win, the Colts improve to 3-2, while the Chiefs fall to 4-1.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Colts showed the best way to beat the Chiefs is to keep the ball out of Patrick Mahomes' hands and keep pressure on when he does have it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Sy9445GVI9AO7xJKvqlgeg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDMuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Up8HMcdgXqP.N0dQ6UKVlQ--~B/aD0yNDI1O3c9Mzg2NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9e164ae0-e8b0-11e9-97cf-a81af5d33919", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
