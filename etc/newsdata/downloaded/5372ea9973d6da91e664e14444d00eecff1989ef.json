Robertson, said at the same conference. Since Q4 2017, the day rates for jack-ups have increased by 80-90 percent in the North Sea, by 50-70 percent in the Middle East, and by 15-25 percent in Australia, Noble said in the presentation at the conference.\n\nThe company noted that there are encouraging indicators of activity with project economics supported by lowered costs and technology advances. In addition, exploration activity is on the rise, geological success rises, and further fleet attrition is expected, according to Noble.\n\nRelated: Russia Capitalizes On America\u2019s Thinly Stretched Middle East Focus\n\nPacific Drilling said at the Pareto conference that offshore supply will be the largest contributor to reserve replacement, and offshore projects are providing healthy cash flows to the exploration and production (E&P) companies. Offshore capital expenditure and floater demand continue to increase, Pacific Drilling said.\n\n\u201cEquity prices should increase towards mid?cycle valuations as utilization pushes higher and day rates rebalance,\u201d the company said in its presentation.\n\nPacific Drilling\u2019s equity trades at a significant discount to most peers on enterprise value (EV)/Rig basis, it says.\n\nWhile offshore rig providers claim that they are a good investor play, they admit that there is a discrepancy between improving offshore drilling market and sliding share prices.\n\nBorr Drilling, for example, noted in its Q2 financials presentation the total disconnect between rising day rates for rigs and sliding share price of the company over the past year.\n\nTransocean\u2019s Vice President Jeremy Lake had this to say on the Q2 conference call:\n\n\u201cReserve replacement ratio for many of our customers continue to decline and our customers are coming off a year during which they collectively generated record cash flows. So it should come as no surprise that utilization rates and day rates have moved off of the bottom and every major operating base around the world.\u201d\n\nIn an H1 market update, Maersk Drilling said last month that \u201cwith stronger free cash flow generation among oil companies, and more financially robust projects supporting increased sanctioning of new projects, demand for offshore rigs is expected to continue increasing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Saudis Scramble To Restore 1/3 Of Disrupted Oil Production Today\n\nHowever, Maersk Drilling noted that the \u201ctiming and magnitude of the recovery, particularly in the floater segment, remains uncertain.\u201d\n\nDrilling contractors have reason to be mildly optimistic this year, Rystad Energy said in June, while Westwood Global Energy Group said in July that there was improvement in the offshore rig market over the past 12-18 months, although utilization remains below the 2010-2014 average.\n\n\u201cWhile there remain some regional markets which continue to be challenged, the rig market as a whole appears to have emerged from one of the worst downturns in its history,\u201d said Matt Adams, Senior Analyst, Rigs & Wells at Westwood.\n\n\u201cWhilst, even in the most optimistic scenario, it seems unlikely that the offshore rig market will return to the heights of the previous upturn, there should no-doubt be cautious optimism,\u201d Adams said.\n\nAnalysts and rig providers are optimistic about the future of the offshore segment, but equity investors have yet to come on board.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Following an \u201cabsolutely horrible year,\u201d analysts are cautiously optimistic about the offshore drilling sector, though investors still aren\u2019t buying in", "authors": ["Tsvetana Paraskova"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
