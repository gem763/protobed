I\u2019m a huge believer in rich countries working together, especially when it\u2019s to help poorer countries. But I don\u2019t think the rise of this populist \u2018every country for themselves\u2019 rhetoric is the full picture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to say we should ignore the rhetoric, but its partly that people don\u2019t see that the co-operative efforts have had great results.\u201d\n\nSpeaking ahead of next week\u2019s annual Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s goalkeepers event in New York, celebrating progress in global development during the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN general assembly, the Microsoft founder admitted that the ambitious targets set at the UN in 2015 \u201care looking unlikely\u201d to be met.\n\nThe 17 sustainable development goals, committed to by 193 world leaders four years ago, are a series of objectives to achieve three things by 2030: end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and fix climate change.\n\nIn the foundation\u2019s own third annual goalkeepers data report, released this week, the data shows progress is being made on health and development, but that inequality remains a major barrier.\n\n\u201cIts definitely a mixed story,\u201d said Gates. The report shows vast improvements being made in child mortality around the world. Even in the worst-off parts of low- and low-middle-income countries, more than 99% of communities have seen an improvement in under five death rates and in schooling.\n\nBut persistent gaps in opportunity mean that nearly half a billion people \u2013 one in 15 \u2013 still do not have access to basic health and education, while inequality between boys and girls means development investments aren\u2019t reaching everyone. Using new, sub-national data, the report uncovers vast inequalities within countries that have been masked by averages.\n\n\u201cWhere you\u2019re born is still the biggest predictor of your future, and no matter where you\u2019re born, life is harder if you\u2019re a girl,\u201d said Gates.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Melinda and Bill Gates at a foundation event in New Delhi, India.

That was very concerning, but what actually happened was that the congress chose not to cut. In the case of the medical research budget, they made a substantial increase.\n\n\u201cFor example, when I called President Macron a year ago and asked him to host the Global Fund this year, I had to be frank and say I didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d get the increase [in cash] we needed to fight malaria, TB and HIV. I didn\u2019t know if Germany were going to come in with the increase we were asking for, I didn\u2019t know if we were even going to be successful in getting everyone to the table, but in fact we saw a meaningful increase in commitment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t predict that this polarisation is going to go away, but I do predict that the human desire to help other people is not; it\u2019s a very strong thing, and in the UK you have a powerful commitment to that. The Conservative party did preside over the aid budget going from 0.5% to 0.7% of gross national income, which was an amazing increase at a time when the budgets were tight. So while I know these things are up to the UK voters and the UK politicians, I haven\u2019t seen that consensus that its important to help the poorest come apart.\u201d\n\nGates said that while things were getting better for people worldwide, the key issue now was inequality within countries, which would only be exacerbated by climate change.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates will use the goalkeepers event to call for a new approach to development, targeting the poorest first, especially with healthcare, and supporting farmers to adapt to climate change.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation under fire over award for Narendra Modi Read more\n\n\u201cIts absolutely right that, over time, climate change will front substantial problems for developing countries. Most of the poorest in these countries are farmers, so temperature extremes, floods and droughts will affect their ability to grow food and feed their families. Most of the focus has been on migration, but the foundation is very involved in adaptation \u2013 where the weather patterns will affect the poorest, helping them adapt,\u201d said Gates,whose foundation has come under fire in the past for its investment in fossil fuels.\n\nGates has said climate activists are wasting their time lobbying investors to ditch stocks, calling it a \u201cfalse solution\u201d that did not reduce emissions. They would do better to get behind the disruptive businesses like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, non-meat protein food companies he supports.\n\nAfter the Guardian spoke to Gates it was announced that a goalkeepers invitation had been extended to India\u2019s president, Narendra Modi \u2013 intended to recognise his work in bringing better sanitation to India, but deeply controversial because Modi is accused of human rights abuses in Kashmir.", "description": "Microsoft billionaire says economic strife undermines \u2018world\u2019s ability to work together\u2019", "authors": ["Tracy Mcveigh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7adf6ba5d34d2961fd00913a16362a6660a920e5/0_13_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0d40f9f3e2e770304a7170635bb307a", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
