Chepngetich herself then collapsed some time after the race while talking to the media.\n\nJust seven athletes managed to break 2hr 40min, with Bahrain\u2019s defending champion Ruth Chelimo taking silver and Commonwealth champion Helalia Johannes, of Namibia, bronze.\n\nBritain\u2019s Charlotte Purdue was one of 16 athletes who failed to even reach the halfway point as the conditions caused problems from the outset. Athletes had become strung out across the course barely half an hour into the race, grimacing as they ploughed lone furrows in an attempt to keep moving.\n\nAll three Ethiopian runners failed to finish, prompting their team\u2019s marathon coach Haji Adillo Roba to tell the BBC: \u201cWe never would have run a marathon in these conditions in our own country.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Roberta Groner, who finished sixth, described it as \u201cabsolutely the most brutal marathon I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nThe 41-year-old mother of three said: \u201cThe key was to finish and not hurt myself. I was just constantly drinking or pouring water on me. Either I had my own water bottle in my hand or I was coming up to the water station and dumping their water on me.\n\n\u201cI used a headband with some ice to trickle down my neck when I could. We tried as hard as we could to stay as hydrated as possible.\u201d\n\nThere will now be major concerns over the safety of remaining distance events, with the men and women\u2019s 50km race walk due to start at 11.30pm this evening and the men\u2019s marathon also starting at midnight next weekend.", "description": "The Doha World Championships descended into carnage in the early hours of Saturday morning, with close to half the women\u2019s marathon field failing to finish as sweltering conditions caused shocking scenes of multiple athletes collapsing in distress.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kgZmO2E46FStE611CCKhvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aW2izDzCJaLdKyQ5T53wTw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/5100ad43040a255ae37f465cc6c21910", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
