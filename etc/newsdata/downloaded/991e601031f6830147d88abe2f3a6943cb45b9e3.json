From 5.30pm, tiny quails rotated on a grill while their eggs were fried in a doughnut maker, pots and woks bubbled with Thai curries, and stir fries and bamboo sticks full of sticky rice were griddled. Whole salted fish, coils of round sausages and meat skewers were all being barbecued over hot coals. Other foods were ready to go: silkworms, dried shrimps and goong ten, or dancing shrimp (raw translucent shrimps eaten alive with chilli), while green papaya salad was pounded in huge pestles \u2026 with as many chillies as you dared.\n\nHelen Jackson\n\nFez, Morocco\n\nFez market has to be the best. It\u2019s car-free and donkey-full. The sights, smells and sounds are a wake-up call to all your senses. Our guide Mohammed\u2019s first words were, \u201cDo not lose me as you will never find your way out.\u201d The narrow streets are full of vendors and craftsmen of ceramics, leather, weaving, mending, and food, both to eat there or to cook at home. The donkeys are shod with rubber recycled from tyres to prevent slipping on the cobbles. Handcarts rule \u2013 with shouts of \u201cbalak, balak\u201d to warn all to move aside as they make their way through the narrow passages. Thankfully we didn\u2019t lose Mohammed and came out the other end.\n\nKate Hendy\n\nProfile Readers' tips competition: send a tip for a chance to win a \u00a3200 voucher Show Hide Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

There\u2019s no place quite like it, a real melting pot \u2013 especially on a Friday. I had my guy for potatoes, my guy for herbs, two lovely Persian Jewish brothers I bought pots and pans from and Samir, a Palestinian from East Jerusalem, who was my guy for veg. There\u2019s something way more enjoyable about going to buy your dinner every night this way, and that something is the people you buy from. I don\u2019t know why I like Samir so much: he\u2019s just a really nice guy. Every time I go back to visit, I seek him out and go and say hello. Here\u2019s to \u201cThe Shuk\u201d keeping its fabulous food and wonderful people.\n\n\u2022 en.machne.co.il\n\nKatie Stobbs\n\nLau Pa Sat food market, Singapore\n\nFor a taste of the colonial among the gleaming skyscrapers of Singapore, head to Lau Pa Sat. The inside of this ornate building has latticed cast-iron pillars, reminiscent of an old Victorian bandstand. Outside, it is at its best at night: when the satay stalls open, the air soon fills with the enticing aroma of sizzling meat. Tables and stools are quickly occupied, and \u201cbeer aunties\u201d roam between the crowds selling jugs of ice-cold Tiger. And, as the main market is open all night, it is a jet-lagged traveller\u2019s dream, albeit a hot, smoky and sweaty one!\n\nJoanna Lawrence\n\nCollege Street book market, Kolkata\n\nThis market sells a bewildering and extensive variety of secondhand books, whose origins can only be guessed at. The booksellers sit on raised wooden stalls peering over randomly stacked towers of secondhand books. I had many friendly conversations with white-bearded vendors about politics, science, religion and literature. I loved watching mothers dragging reluctant first-year university students around trying to find all the textbooks on their reading lists for bargain prices. The Indian Coffee House on Bankim Chatterjee Street, a famous meeting spot for Kolkata\u2019s intelligentsia, provides a welcome retreat, brilliant eavesdropping opportunities and sugary coffee.\n\nTess\n\nWinter Night Market, Melbourne\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Nigel Killeen/Getty Images\n\nFrom June each year, Melbourne\u2019s Victoria Market runs a Winter Night Market that is at once a cheap culinary adventure around the world and an opportunity to have moments of random conviviality with locals and travellers while you queue for your halloumi fries/dumplings/kimchi/paella/froyo. It\u2019s lively and cool but unpretentious; it\u2019s free to get in; there\u2019s often a band that you can listen to with your inventive margarita; and people seem to come determined to have a good time in a particular make-your-own-fun Melbourne way. It\u2019s good for friends, solo adventurers and families of some ages (it\u2019s hard to get around with a pram, and toddlers may need carrying).\n\n\u2022 thenightmarket.com.au\n\nBridget\n\nPike Place Market, Seattle, US\n\nPike Place is the source of the area\u2019s fresh fruit, fish and flowers. All of this produce is put to good use as Pike\u2019s is home to several independent coffee shops and restaurants that overlook the Pugent Sound. If there is a more perfect way to spend the evening than drinking a craft beer and watching the sunset over Bainbridge Island, I am yet to find it. If you are a fan of grunge music, Pike Place is massively important as it\u2019s opposite the legendary Showbox venue and was also one of the locations in the cult film Singles. Ironically for such an independent venue, it is also the birthplace of one of the world\u2019s biggest brands \u2013 Starbucks first ever store is there.\n\n\u2022 pikeplacemarket.org\n\nJennifer\n\nTurkish market, Berlin\n\nBerlin\u2019s most charming flea market takes place next to the stunning Landwehrkanal every other Sunday. While tourists head to Mauerpark, this is where, to me, the real fun (and bargains) can be found. If you\u2019ve ever wondered where Berliners pick up their unique clothes, answers can be found here. You can quickly assemble a new clubbing outfit from one of the many stalls where hungover Neuk\u00f6llners are passing on half their wardrobe. There is also plenty of East German kitsch, straight from the attic, beautiful kids\u2019 clothes and toys, and food from Japanese, French and Turkish stalls, which you can eat on the banks of the canal. Go late, like a local, coffee in hand.\n\n\u2022 tuerkenmarkt.de\n\nKatie\n\nMercado de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de \u00c1frica, Tenerife\n\nThe beautiful market building with its statues and flowers was gorgeous, but more astounding were the displays of seafood, fruit and vegetables. The colour and variety of the produce blew my mind. When you realise that this market was threatened with extinction and was saved by a group of merchants, it becomes even more impressive. Fighting the invasion of junk food and big box stores, they formed a non-profit group and eventually were rewarded by the Canarian Government and the Santa Cruz City Hall for restoring the market as a hub for the community.\n\n\u2022 On Facebook\n\nKate Holbrook\n\nEl Mercado Central de Atarazanas, M\u00e1laga, Spain\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Getty Images\n\nEl Mercado Central de Atarazanas is the indoor food market in the centre of M\u00e1laga, selling fresh local produce. The building is impressive, with a huge stained-glass window at one end, but of equal artistic merit are the displays of seasonal fruit and veg. We watched the fishmongers at work on the latest catch and were tempted by the charcuter\u00eda and olive stalls. There are a couple of bars inside, opening out on to the street but we retired to an old sherry bar, only a five-minute walk away, to toast our purchases.\n\n\u2022 malagaturismo.com\n\nMoira\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
