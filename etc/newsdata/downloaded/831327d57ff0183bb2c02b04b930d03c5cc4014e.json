No problem \u2014 you can share the game with them easily.\n\nJust note that if you start playing the game on your system, it will pause their game right in the middle of the action.

This means you can't share games you only have the physical version of.\n\nTo share a downloaded game, you'll have to temporarily deregister your Switch as your primary console (don't worry, you can always undo that change) and give your login information to the other player, so trust is key here.\n\n1. From your Switch homepage, go to the Nintendo eShop using the orange shopping bag icon near the bottom of the screen.\n\n2.

Now have the user of the other Switch log into your Nintendo account. They'll now be able to download any game you've purchased without having to pay.\n\nWhile both consoles will have that game downloaded, only one account can play the game at a time. If a second account attempts to log onto a game simultaneously, the primary console will get kicked off.\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "You can gameshare on your Nintendo Switch by logging someone into your Nintendo account.
