Trysta Krick reacts to all the biggest games and moments from a wild weekend in the NFL. USA TODAY\n\nSometimes NFL players decide to play through pain.\n\nBut what Tampa Bay Buccaneers right guard Alex Cappa did Sunday in a 31-24 loss against the New Orleans Saints was remarkable.\n\nBuccaneers head coach Bruce Arians told reporters on Monday that Cappa suffered a broken left arm but did not miss a snap after sustaining the injury in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cI commend Alex Cappa,\u201d Arians told reporters. \u201cHe broke his arm in the second quarter and played the entire game. He\u2019ll miss a few weeks. But it\u2019s next man up.\"\n\nAccording to the Pewter Report, Cappa told reporters after the game that the injury was \"just a bruise.\"\n\nIn Cappa\u2019s place, the Buccaneers are likely to turn to backup guard Earl Watford. Cappa, 24, is entering his second season with Tampa Bay, and his first as the full-time starter after the team took him in the third round of the 2018 draft, No. 94 overall.\n\nThe Bucs must now scramble to keep the line intact, as Cappa wasn\u2019t the only starter to go down. Arians added that starting right tackle Demar Dotson will miss Week 6\u2019s game against the Carolina Panthers in London with a hamstring injury.\n\n\"We can\u2019t make excuses, but we\u2019ll have a new right side of our line, probably,\" Arians said.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "After Buccaneers right guard Alex Cappa suffered a broken left arm in the second quarter of a loss against the Saints, he didn't miss a snap.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
