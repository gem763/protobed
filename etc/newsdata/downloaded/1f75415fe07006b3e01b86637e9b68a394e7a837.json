A keen eye has spotted a tub of a truly game-changing Caramilk Philly cream cheese. Sweet Jesus Mary and Joseph, this is big.\n\nThe lovechild of the fought-over Caramilk choc and the cream cheese has landed on shelves in Woolies around the traps, sending lovers of the choc and the creamy chez into a damn tizzy. Hell, even I want to try it. Imagine that shit schmeared on a toasted blueberry bagel, or whipped into a perfect cheesecake.\n\nJesus this is a blessed image, thank you for these sacred treasures.\n\nI wish to acquire several of this heaven-in-a-tub and either eat it all with a spoon or make some kind of fucked-up Caramilk Philly dessert cob loaf. Can you even get brioche buns big enough to turn into a cob? My heart is racing and my mind is buzzing with ideas of what I can do with this frankly insane thing.\n\nWhat about if you get the Caramilk Philly cream cheese, melt it down, and then turn it into a fondue where you dip the Caramilk choccy INTO it. I\u2019ve dreamt up a god-damned monster here, friends.\n\nMuch like the return of the choccy blocks, the Caramilk Philly cream cheese is a limited edition treat, and is going for $4 a pop over at your local Woolies. You\u2019re welcome.", "description": "Tubs of Caramilk Philly cream cheese have been spotted in the wild and it is simply illegal for those to exist unless I am given one immediately.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/caramilk-philly-site.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
