That may, and arguably should, have been Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s plan going into Friday night. The last time they\u2019d played Leverkusen, they had begun with hope and ended humiliated. Eintracht\u2019s trip to BayArena was set between the two legs of their Europa League semi-final with Chelsea, the third-from-last Bundesliga game of the season and with the team having the chance of a Champions League place in their own hands.\n\nIt was, ultimately, the moment in which it became abundantly clear that Eintracht\u2019s tank had pretty much run dry. After 36 minutes in Leverkusen they were 6-1 down, shell-shocked and bereft. That ended up as the final score as they zombie-marched through the remainder of the game \u2013 as an almost equally-stunned home side did as well to an extent \u2013 and even though they ended that Sunday afternoon still in fourth place, it felt as if a fat wedge of possibility had been left there. They still managed, improbably, to pull a heroic performance out from somewhere for the second leg with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and it was agonisingly close to being enough to get them to the Baku final. They fell to the Blues on penalties in the end, and that used up the last few drips of fuel Adi H\u00fctter and his team had.\n\nEintracht ended 2018-19 as they had begun it in the DFL-Supercup, being absolutely flamed by Bayern and their former boss Niko Kova\u010d. Only Mainz\u2019s late surge against Hoffenheim, scoring three times in the closing ten minutes, enabled the most fun team in the Europa League the privilege of a return to the competition, beginning in July\u2019s second qualifying round, after hanging on to seventh place. The club\u2019s fans are a special breed, grateful for the journey as much as they are the destination, so recriminations for missing out on the top four were strictly limited.\n\nWhen footballers and coaches say that they\u2019re never interested in revenge, though, they\u2019re fibbing. On Friday night, Eintracht\u2019s will to put that first half horror show of five months back behind them couldn\u2019t have been clearer. Eintracht tore into the game, which was only three-and-a-half minutes old when Danny da Costa\u2019s through pass revealed their intentions. Open them up like they opened us. The ball trimmed Leverkusen\u2019s rearguard in two and Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia cruised on to that perfect transmission, holding off the floundering Aleksandar Dragovi\u0107 before sweeping home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Bas Dost celebrates scoring in the morale-boosting 3-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen last Friday.

The script was a well-worn one for Frankfurt, with the front men making the magic happen but the detail of the difference is key. It\u2019s not just the result for the BayArena that has flipped in the last few months.\n\nThe front three that made Eintracht such an essential watch last season are all gone \u2013 S\u00e9bastien Haller to West Ham, Luka Jovi\u0107 to Real Madrid and Ante Rebi\u0107 went late in the window to Milan, in a swap which brought Portugal\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Silva back in return. It\u2019s hard to think of a more different forward trio to Haller, Jovi\u0107 and Rebi\u0107 than Paci\u00eancia, Silva and Dost (not least due to the fact that H\u00fctter seems disinclined to play all three at the same time). Paci\u00eancia comes closest of the three to filling the void of what Haller\u2019s all-round game provided, but the comparison (not least in terms of quality) feels a bit stretched. Yet for now, the new trio are filling their boots in a similar way to their predecessors. They have 11 of Eintracht\u2019s 14 Bundesliga goals to date between them.\n\nWhether H\u00fctter sees them as a three is a different question. The click between Paci\u00eancia and Dost, incidentally, might not even have got to work on Leverkusen had the former\u2019s compatriot Silva not been a late pull out with a foot problem. The assumption, on the completion of the transfer window, would have been that Dost and Silva would start with supplementary help from Filip Kosti\u0107.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\n\nThe Kosti\u0107 part of the equation is right. His performance on the left against Leverkusen was of such verve and ferocity that Mitchell Weiser, charged with taking care of him by Peter Bosz, was hooked after half-an-hour. Yet as Dost has been gradually blooded into H\u00fctter\u2019s system since returning to the Bundesliga from Portugal, he and Silva have fitted around the man who was back-up last term. Paci\u00eancia has blossomed.\n\nA graduate of the Porto academy like his father Domingos, it feels like this is Paci\u00eancia\u2019s time. At 25, he is no longer one for the future, but one that needs to produce now. He always had big shoes to fill. Domingos, a key part of Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s conquering Porto sides of the mid-90s, scored 131 goals for the club and won seven league titles while doing it. \u201cAt home, they always want to talk to my father, not me,\u201d he noted with a smile recently. In Germany, where Domingos\u2019 legend is less noted, Paci\u00eancia junior seems to be off the leash. At Porto, he was always destined to be compared with what went before. It\u2019s significant that his best spell back home was in a productive half-season loan with the more modest Vit\u00f3ria Set\u00fabal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eintrach Frankfurt manager Adolf H\u00fctter, right, with Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia during the Champions League meeting with Vitoria SC earlier this month. Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images\n\nIt has taken time to adapt. He made a scoring debut for his new club but in the most inauspicious of circumstances; a consolation goal in the embarrassing DfB Pokal exit to fourth-tier Ulm last August, which meant the holders were turfed out of the competition before the Bundesliga campaign had even started and piled pressure on the new coach H\u00fctter before the club staff even knew how he likes to take his coffee. Then he suffered a torn meniscus that kept him out for four months.\n\nNow, he\u2019s ready. Paci\u00eancia is becoming a tremendous focal point for H\u00fctter\u2019s team. That Dost had his best game for the club so far, with Paci\u00eancia doing his stuff, was surely no coincidence. On top of that, the Portuguese has already matched his best-ever goal tally for a league season \u2013 five, which underlines how peripatetic and sometimes frustrating his first-team career to date has been \u2013 with the promise of more to come. Eintracht fans might not have imagined their front three looking like this but for now, it looks pretty good.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 Eintracht are in the mix with a clutch of other teams, with only two points separating the top nine. Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach remain top despite losing at Dortmund. Marco Reus, inevitably, scored the winner against his own club while Thorgan Hazard (who created the goal) had his best BVB game yet against his former club \u2013 which he needed to, with Jadon Sancho left out for returning late from international duty.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marco Reus, of Borussia Dortmund, was on target against Borussia Moenchengladbach.
