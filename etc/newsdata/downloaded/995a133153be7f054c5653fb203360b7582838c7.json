The third debate confirmed that the former vice president isn\u2019t up to the task.\n\nRahm Emanuel helped Chicago police cover up Laquan McDonald\u2019s murder for more than a year, but ABC viewers Thursday night had to listen to him say he thought Juli\u00e1n Castro had been too unkind to Joe Biden. Since it requires the least analysis and garners the most eyeballs, the punditry after presidential debates tends to be focused primarily upon the most tense moments, not the substantive ones. Castro, an underdog candidate who once served as President Obama\u2019s HUD secretary, gave pundits like the disgraced former mayor considerable grist when he rather bluntly questioned the septuagenarian former vice president\u2019s memory during a discussion about health care.\n\n\u201cI think for Castro \u2014 he could have made the point, he had a legitimate point, but it\u2019s a disqualifier the way he handled it,\u201d Emanuel said shortly after ABC began its postgame coverage. \u201cIt will come across as mean and vindictive. That\u2019s not who he is.\u201d (He is an expert in \u201cmean and vindictive\u201d himself, so feigning horror at Castro\u2019s attack is pretty rich. Emanuel is clearly better at hiding videotapes.)\n\nI don\u2019t know whether people like Emanuel have forgotten whom these Democrats are preparing to run against. If Castro\u2019s point was correct, which it seems he wasn\u2019t, how is it disqualifying if it\u2019s only perceived as rude? Will they spend all of the general election scolding Donald Trump for being too cruel and obnoxious to their nominee?\n\nPerhaps they will, if it is Biden, a person whom party centrists like Emanuel are already prone to coddling. Treating the 76-year-old front-runner so delicately is arguably more insulting than questioning his mental fitness, especially considering the incumbent whom he is preparing to run against.\n\nDonald Trump is not merely a bully, but a racist one. Bigotry has been the marrow of his presidency, so whoever hopes to face him next year will need to at least be fluent in the language of antiracism, if not be practicing it. It is not enough, as author Ibram X. Kendi writes in his new book How to Be an Antiracist, to simply claim that you are \u201cnot a racist.\u201d Democrats, particularly white liberals, have skated on that for generations. There is too much institutional cruelty for the next president to undo should a Democrat defeat Trump next fall.\n\nThat is why though they are often contentious and occasionally unpleasant for the likes of Emanuel, debates are essential vetting tests, particularly this time around. Thankfully, ABC seemed to understand this. They had excellent moderators, including Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos and ABC correspondent Linsey Davis, the panel\u2019s only African American. She asked several questions of the entire field that provoked the kind of frank and open discussion of black concerns and political interests that is rare for a presidential debate. It was fitting, given the setting on the historically black campus of Texas Southern University, but also because Davis said that young black voters consider racism their chief concern.\n\nDavis\u2019 questioning provoked some fascinating responses. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend who has released a comprehensive \u201cDouglass Plan\u201d to attack systemic racism, took note of how often our framework of \u201cworking class\u201d defaults to whiteness. The two ex-prosecutors on stage, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, faced questions about their records (with varying success). Cory Booker called out jurisprudence for its simulacrum of enslavement, noting that \u201cwe have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke signaled his support for a Congressional inquiry into reparations and took a cue from the recent New York Times Magazine\u2019s 1619 Project. \u201cRacism in America is endemic. It is foundational,\u201d the former Texas Congressman said. \u201cWe can mark the creation of this country not at the Fourth of July, 1776, but August 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave built the greatness and the success and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy.\u201d\n\nHowever, Davis later directed a question at Biden concerning his alarming 1975 comments on school segregation. She read the full quote, \u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago,\u201d and Biden smirked oddly as she did so. The correspondent followed up by asking, \u201cWhat responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\u201d Without missing a beat, the Democratic front-runner delivered a response that was considerably more disqualifying than anything Castro said all night.\n\nHaving just had something offensive that he said 44 years ago quoted back to him, Biden took the opportunity to say something that was arguably worse.\n\nAfter proposing that teacher raises are the first step to undoing the legacy of slavery, Biden said the following. It\u2019s worth reading in full.\n\nNumber two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home, we need \u2014 we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It\u2019s crazy.\n\nThe teachers are \u2014 I\u2019m married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have \u2014 make sure that every single child does, in fact, have 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds go to school. School. Not daycare. School. We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\n\nThat\u2019s the current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination a) first appearing to treat the mere mention of an old segregationist quote of his as ridiculous, then b) responding to a question about repairing the legacy of slavery by saying that the government needs to have teachers go into the homes of kids in poor schools to teach the parents how to raise those children. And what color are the children, disproportionately, going to those poor schools? Nowhere in that answer is a prescription for making the poor families less so, nor for improving the schools. It\u2019s the kind of paternalistic racism that has so long existed in both liberal and conservative circles, and was on Thursday night spilling out of the mouth of the former vice president on the campus of an HBCU. It was all quite a sight to behold.\n\nI should mention that there is a c): Biden never truly gave Davis\u2019 question any serious consideration. Whether or not white political candidates like Biden consider repairing slavery\u2019s legacy to be a more abstract and amorphous notion than protecting Obamacare or ending Trump\u2019s policies of migrant persecution, it is at the very heart of the fight to end systemic racism and white supremacy. Metastasizing both have been top agenda items for the Trump administration. Yet the top contender appears not to have even the vocabulary to engage in an antiracist conversation, let alone combat Trump\u2019s agenda properly. He chose to use that stage to proselytize about record players in the homes of poor families of color who need the teachers to raise their kids for them. Who chooses to do that in a party that needs black voters to win?\n\nEven worse, Biden\u2019s terrible quote was just part of his evening\u2019s racial disaster. He showed that he is not only unprepared to take on Trump, but that he is actually starting to emulate some of his worst traits. When Ramos inquired what he\u2019d done to stop the record 3 million deportations during the Obama administration, Biden responded with a purely false statement. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages. We didn\u2019t separate families. We didn\u2019t do all of those things, number one.\u201d They did do all of those things. Though not to the grotesque extent of the Trump administration, certainly, but Biden is fighting photographic evidence here. Ramos had asked him, openly, \u201cWhy should Latinos trust you?\u201d And the first thing Biden did was lie.\n\nBiden\u2019s thinking on incarceration may have evolved his thinking since his Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, known more infamously as the crime bill, was signed into law 25 years ago today by President Bill Clinton. However, it was jarring to see the man behind the legislation that helped explode mass incarceration in this country, especially on the state level \u2014 and who said in a 1994 Senate floor speech, \u201cI would say, \u2018Lock the S.O.B.s up\u201d \u2014 stand last night in Texas and claim that \u201cNobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.\u201d Considering who was mostly hurt by the crime bill, I\u2019ll paraphrase Ramos: why should African Americans trust you?\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s swelling poll numbers with black voters, we don\u2019t have to trust him. In fact, the former vice president should do the honorable thing after that disgrace of a debate and remove himself from contention for the nomination. Yes, even with him leading most polls. It isn\u2019t about him winning. It\u2019s about the party winning, then having a successful presidency undoing Trump\u2019s racist policies.\n\nDemocrats will need an antiracist candidate to defeat Trump because Trump is a white nationalist with white-nationlist policies. Good poll numbers with the black electorate do not make one antiracist. A moderate, milquetoast criminal-justice plan that largely seeks to repair some of the damage he did with the 1994 crime bill does not make one antiracist. Biden not only isn\u2019t picking up what it means to fit the definition, but his debate remarks provide evidence that he is actively rejecting it. As such, he should leave the race to contenders who have the party\u2019s most loyal constituency, black voters, in mind.\n\nNear the end of How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi, the author, relates the fight to end racism with his own recent battle with cancer. \u201cWhat if we treated racism in the way we treated cancer? What has historically been effective at combating racism is analogous to what has been effective at combating cancer,\u201d Kendi argues. \u201cSaturate the body politic with the chemotherapy or immunotherapy of antiracist policies that shrink the tumors of racial inequities, that kill undetectable cancer cells.\u201d\n\nBut as Kendi writes after his metaphor, the important thing, as with medical treatment, is belief. We must believe that all is not lost, and that this racist society can be transformed. However, I doubt sincerely that I can be convinced that the current Democratic presidential front-runner is equipped to carry out that transformation, if he were even lucky enough to defeat the white-nationalist incumbent lying in wait.\n\nThursday\u2019s debate was indeed a defining moment, but not for the candidate most pundits claim. While some may cry that the low-polling Castro blew his chance at a V.P. selection or clamor for him to step out of the race, it is the man he targeted whom we need to be focused upon. The former vice president can trumpet his Obama associations all he wishes, but after that debate, it comes across merely as the \u201cI have a black friend\u201d excuse. Biden is not only deficient as an antiracist, if he ever was one, but he is saying things \u2014 at a Democratic debate on an HBCU campus, no less \u2014 that make it absolutely impossible to trust him to be the party\u2019s best candidate to address systemic racism and to ameliorate the nation the current administration leaves behind.\n\nIf defeating Trump in 2020 is as important to Biden as he so often claims, he should end his campaign and remove himself from contention for president.", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Jamil Smith", "Senior Writer", "Jamil Smith'S Most Recent Stories", "Why It S Time For Joe To Go", "We Can Reverse This", "Why A Black Pastor Supports Joe Biden", "Being Right When Trump Is Wrong Is Apparently A Fireable Offense", "View All"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167635068WW.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
