Biden's ability to finance a multi-state primary campaign, persistent questions about Senator Elizabeth Warren's viability in the general election and skepticism that Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters, Democratic leaders are engaging in a familiar rite: fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute.\"\n\nWe're mindful that American politics is always capable of producing plenty of surprises \u2014 so it's entirely possible another Dem can break through in the next 100 days before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nBut if you had, back in February or March, the 20-plus candidates being whittled down to these four Democratic candidates after the fourth Democratic debate, you might want to go buy a lottery ticket.\n\nIt was far from preordained that these would be the Top 4 in late October 2019.\n\nImpeachment inquiry update: Taylor testifies\n\nAmbassador Bill Taylor \u2014 the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine \u2014 is set to be deposed today in closed session, per NBC's Geoff Bennett.\n\nTaylor, if you recall from those released text messages, is the U.S. diplomat who appeared HIGHLY skeptical of the Trump administration's maneuvers with Ukraine's new president.\n\nTaylor on July 21 \u2014 four days before Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's Zelensky: \"Gordon [Sondland], one thing Kurt [Volker] and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk's point that President Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\"\n\nTaylor on Sept. 1: \"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\"\n\nTaylor on Sept. 9: \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"\n\nAlso, the New York Times reports that Trump met with a critic of Ukraine's new government \u2014 Hungary's Viktor Orban \u2014 just days before a key meeting, and Trump \"heard a sharp assessment that bolstered his hostility toward the country, according to several people informed about the situation.\"\n\nMore: \"Mr. Trump at a critical moment in the Ukraine saga sat down in the Oval Office with a European leader with a fiercely negative outlook on Ukraine that fortified opinions he had heard from his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia repeatedly over the months and years.\"\n\nOther countries' elections\n\nLast night, Justin Trudeau won a second term as Canada's prime minister.\n\n\"Official results won't be announced until all votes are accounted for, but based on ballots already reported, the CBC, CTV News and Radio Canada projected that Trudeau's Liberal Party would win enough seats in the House of Commons to be able to form a minority government,\" per NBC News.\n\n\"Under a minority government, the Liberals would have to join with a smaller party to pass legislation in the House of Commons.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu admitted he couldn't form a new government after last month's election.\n\n\"The opportunity to form a stable government will now fall to his rival Benny Gantz, who leads the main opposition Blue and White party.\"\n\nTweet of the day\n\n2020 Vision: A Tale of Two Different Democratic Campaigns\n\nRepeating a gambit first deployed by Cory Booker last month, Julian Castro yesterday told supporters that he'll drop out of the 2020 campaign if he can't raise $800,000 by the end of October, NBC's Maura Barrett reports.\n\nBy contrast, Amy Klobuchar told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow last night that her campaign has raised $2 million since last week's debate, per NBC's Amanda Golden.\n\nOn the campaign trail today: A busy day in Iowa\n\nElizabeth Warren hits Waterloo (for a small-business walking tour) and Cedar Falls (where she holds a town hall)\u2026 Kamala Harris is in Cedar Rapids, Vinton and Iowa City\u2026 And Marianna Williamson also visits in Iowa City\u2026 Andrew Yang is in New Hampshire\u2026 Pete Buttigieg campaigns in Las Vegas\u2026 And Tulsi Gabbard speaks in DC.\n\nDispatches from NBC's embeds\n\nNBC's Gary Grumbach notices a change in Bernie Sanders' approach to discussing his friendship with opponent Elizabeth Warren during an interview on PBS: \"Host Judy Woodruff asked Sanders, 'For people who are out there looking at these two world views, what is the difference?' Sanders responded how he typically does, suggesting he and 'Elizabeth' are 'good friends,' but he did add a new phrasing to this answer. 'I think the only way we bring about real change in this country is not within Capitol Hill,' Sanders said, invoking past political and cultural movements like the women's movement and labor movement to make his point. This is a minor change, for sure, but it does seem that gone are the days of his 'Elizabeth is a good friend and I will not disparage anyone else' answers.\"\n\nData Download: The number of the day is \u2026 26 percent\n\n26 percent.\n\nThat's the share of Americans who say they approve of Donald Trump *and* that there's almost nothing he could do to lose their support, per a new PRRI poll.\n\nThat includes 37 percent of all Republicans, 31 percent of white evangelicals and 55 percent(!) of Republicans whose primary news source is Fox News.\n\nOn the flip side, nearly half \u2014 46 percent \u2014 of Americans say they disapprove of Trump and that there's almost nothing he could do to win their approval.\n\nThe Lid: Fifth Avenue Freeze-out\n\nDon't miss the pod from yesterday, when we took a closer look at that \"Fifth Avenue\" vote.\n\nShameless plug\n\nLate last week, NBC News launched Article II: Inside Impeachment \u2014 a new podcast looking at all of the latest developments during the impeachment inquiry, hosted by Steve Kornacki.
