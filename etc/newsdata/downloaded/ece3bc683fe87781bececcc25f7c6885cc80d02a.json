Richard Ciccarella tearfully apologized to a federal judge for posting photos on a Russian website of an underage girl who was wearing only underwear, The Palm Beach Post reported . One of the photos had a title urging users to submit \u201cdirty\u201d responses, according to court records.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Schiller said the photos didn\u2019t constitute child pornography, but Ciccarella lied to investigators about posting the photos.\n\n\u201cHere the lie and the obstruction was to cover up an email address to cover up a much bigger investigation that was going on,\u201d Schiller said.\n\nCiccarella, a 34-year-old who is now stationed in Virginia, said he lied because he was afraid.\n\n\u201cI will forever regret my actions,\u201d he said.\n\nCiccarella pleaded guilty in July to making a false statement to a federal agent. He was sentenced to three years of probation and is required to receive treatment as a sex offender and prohibited from having any unsupervised contact with minors. He must also complete 100 hours of community service.\n\nSchiller had asked U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks to send Ciccarella to jail for as long as six months.\n\nCiccarella led the Army\u2019s communication detail for Trump\u2019s exclusive Palm Beach club from August 2017 to March 2018. He uploaded the photos to the Russian website from November 2017 to February 2018, according to court documents.\n\nPrior to being stationed at Mar-a-Lago, Ciccarella had done two tours in Iraq and had worked for about five years in the White House, where he helped operate the switchboard as he placed calls for the president and vice president.\n\nCiccarella\u2019s superiors have said he could be court martialed, said his defense attorney Michael Salnick.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A military officer who had been in charge of the U.S. Army's White House communications at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club received probation Friday for lying to federal agents during a child pornography investigation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/05/28/trump_mar_a_lago_interloper_53742_c0-168-4025-2514_s1770x1032.jpg?fce4937da916f316b2afbb4a5d6ba7faaf1892e8", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
