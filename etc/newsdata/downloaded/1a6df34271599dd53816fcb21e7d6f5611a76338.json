This attention is distracting them from the important work that they do.\"\n\nThe University of Sussex said: \"This year, and in light of the legal situation in the US, the University and Sackler Trust decided not to progress with further pledges.\"", "description": "Two institutions were awarded a combined \u00a33.4m last year from the family behind Purdue Pharma.", "authors": ["Dearbail Jordan", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C402/production/_109287105_kingscollege-index-alamy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
