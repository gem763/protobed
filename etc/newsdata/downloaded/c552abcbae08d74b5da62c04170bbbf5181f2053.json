Legend has it that Martins, after her mother died, moved her father into the outside room, which she painted black. The room had no windows, only had a potbellied stove and a bed for him to sleep on. Her father had been verbally abusive to her and this was her way of getting back at him...\n\nAfter her father died in this room, Martins started to transform the house and the garden \u2013 decorating it with eerie statues. Some tales say Martins fell in love with her gardener \u2013 a man of colour - and proceeded to take her own life by swallowing poison as interracial relationships were illegal in South Africa at the time.\n\n\n\nThe route to the Owl House is a trip through the eerie, arid heartland of the Great Karoo.\n\nSEE: Owl House reflections in Nieu Bethesda\n\n\n\nA photo posted by Amilinda Wilkinson (@my_mon_ammi) on Oct 18, 2015 at 10:57pm PDT\n\n\n\nCaptain and crew of The Flying Dutchman\n\n\n\nMade famous by the Pirates of the Caribbean movie, the 17th Century Der Fliegende Hollander is a ghost ship some people claim to have seen appear in the waters of the Cape of Good Hope. True to the tales, it has been sighted over the centuries by everyone from sailors to royalty.\n\n\n\nThe ship did sail the seas once, and was one of the many shipwrecked along the notorious Cape of Storms.\n\n\n\nThe route to seeing where The Flying Dutchman came to its end is along Cape Point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaisy de Melker's house - Turffontein\n\n\n\nThe notorious Daisy de Melker was the first serial killer ever to be convicted in South Africa after killing off two husbands and a son through poisoning in the 1920s. She was hanged for her crimes in 1932 and is said to haunt most of the places associated with her, among others Court 3 in the Johannesburg Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nHer home in Club Street in Turffontein, however, is the scariest place. It is still standing and sometimes Daisy can still be seen there, peering out the upstairs window.\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo posted by Tarryn Lochner (@tarryoterra) on Apr 14, 2013 at 8:50am PDT\n\nLord Milner Hotel, Matjiesfontein\n\n\n\nMatjiesfontein is home to numerous ghosts, but the most commonly sighted ones are seen in or around the Lord Milner Hotel, built in 1899. The ghostly gang includes Kate, a 19-year old Boer Nurse, James Logan, the original town founder, and a poltergeist called Lucy.\n\n\n\nYou can drive along the N1 to this haunted hotel, but taking the old-school train is a much cooler outing!\n\nWATCH: A laid-back weekend along the Forgotten Route\n\nA photo posted by Greg Carlin (@gregcarlin) on Sep 29, 2015 at 1:14pm PDT\n\n\n\nGhost of Uniondale\n\n\n\nThis is probably the best known ghost legend in South Africa. Legend has it that a recently engaged couple drove through stormy weather one Easter weekend to the town of Uniondale in 1986. The couple was driving in their Volkswagen Beetle when the young lad overturned the car, killing his fianc\u00e9 \u2013 Marie Charlotte Roux.\n\n\n\nEver since, many drivers have reported ghost-like activity in the area, especially over the Easter weekend.\n\n\n\nThe route follows the Barandas-Willowmore road, around 20km from Uniondale.\n\nA photo posted by Going Somewhere Slowly (@going_somewhere_slowly) on Jun 24, 2015 at 2:49pm PDT\n\n\n\nPrince Albert, Klein Karoo\n\n\n\nPrince Albert has a doomed bride who was said to have died in a cart accident on the eve of her wedding, decades ago. She is known in town to haunt the parlour of the house that is now the Fransie Pienaar Museum.\n\n\n\nPrince Albert is in the heart of the Klein Karoo and a road trip to the area is equally exciting as a ghost walk through the town itself.\n\nSEE: Cheese, bougainvillea and slow living in the Great Karoo\n\n\n\nA photo posted by @ekshelga on Oct 22, 2015 at 10:39am PDT\n\n\n\nThe Castle of Good Hope, Cape Town\n\n\n\nThe Castle of Good Hope is one of the oldest colonial buildings in South Africa, and is said to be home to several unexplained phenomena, such as ghostly footsteps, flickering lights, and specters that appear; one of which is reputed to be the castle\u2019s first official hostess, Lady Anne Barnard.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year Traveller24 received a letter from a reader who told us of another ghostly experience. He explained peering into a supposedly empty room, and seeing men dressed in colonial attire stand over an old world map \u2013 in heavy conversation\u2026 Years after, the reader said, he thought he must have seen something otherworldly as he was the only one of his tour group to have seen this sight\u2026\n\n\n\nThe route around the Castle of Good Hope is a short one, but none the less hair-raising\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo posted by Marluce Fagotti (@marlucefagotti) on Sep 18, 2015 at 6:28am PDT\n\n\n\nKaroo Mermaids\n\n\n\nStories of a beautiful dark-haired, blue-eyed mermaid living in the Klein Karoo near De Rust have been murmured about in local circles for the last few centuries. Legend has it that she lives in the bottomless pool below Skelm waterfall in the Meiringspoort.\n\n\n\nA drive though the iconic Meiringspoort, with a stop at the Skelm waterfall will lead you right to her.\n\nSA ROAD TRIPS MAPPED: Highlights of the Karoo Highlands Route\n\n\n\nA photo posted by Manoushka Kraal (@noushprojects) on Sep 29, 2015 at 1:09am PDT\n\n\n\n\n\nUitkomst Farm, Machadodorp\n\n\n\nAbout 20km outside of the Mpumalanga town of Machadodorp, a beautiful waterfall can be found on a farm called Uitkomst. According to legend, aA young honeymoon couple was exploring the waterfall when the woman lost her footing and slipped to her death. A year later her distraught husband returned and took his own life on the same spot.\n\n\n\nOn moonlit nights, the reunited pair may still be seen at the top of the waterfall. Dare to drive it on Halloween night to see the love-lost couple.\n\nWelkom hospital\n\n\n\nAnother Traveller24 reader, Thinus Heunis, told us about this haunted house. Ghosts and spirits have been noted in the abandoned Kopano Hospital so many times that there is now a dedicated Facebook page where visitors can share their otherworldly experiences...\n\n\n\nTake a drive up Long Road in Welkom at night to feel the chills at the back of your neck. Who knows, you might even spot a flickering of lights in the long-abandoned building!\n\nSEE: Discover SA's less-explored road trip wonders of the Free State\n\n\n\nAlanglade House in Pilgrim\u2019s Rest\n\n\n\nThis Pilgrim\u2019s Rest family was repeatedly hit by tragedy, with all three sons dying in their 20s. When Mrs Barry \u2013 who occupied Alanglade house \u2013 died, she left all the sorrow of her life and losses behind in the house. The original furniture is still standing around in the house, hauntingly. From the baby\u2019s cot to the dolls with which the children used to play.\n\n\n\nTake a trip to Pilgrim\u2019s Rest, but be sure to go on one of the facilitated ghost tours through the town.\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo posted by Marius (@grussundkuss_marius) on Sep 6, 2015 at 12:42am PDT\n\n\n\nThe road outside East London\n\n\n\nThe Christian community of East London came together to erect a cross and signpost just outside East London along the R346 after multiple, inexplicable accidents took place on the road on one particular spot.\n\n\n\nVarious unconnected drivers who survived these strange accidents say ghosts caused them to crash their cars. The victims said they were driving alone in their cars past this particular spot when suddenly they would hear loud voices in the car. The fright of the voices made them swerve and in some cases overturn their vehicles\u2026\n\nWATCH: The pure beauty of East London\n\nA photo posted by Tsepiso Nzayo (@tsepisonzayo) on Mar 21, 2015 at 5:56am PDT\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Escape by searching and comparing flight prices here.
