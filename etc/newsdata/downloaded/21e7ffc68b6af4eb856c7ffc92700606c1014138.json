These devices are turning into a showcase for a new version of Microsoft, one where the PC and Windows, while important, are no longer the company's primary concerns.\n\nWindows is not the core of Microsoft anymore. Microsoft has been evolving into a cloud and productivity applications company for some time now. Sure, if those apps are running on Windows, then Microsoft is even happier, but making sure Windows is everywhere is no longer the goal. The focus has shifted.\n\nSEE: What if Microsoft had invented Android?\n\nThat, for example, is why the Surface Duo phone will run on Android, a decision that Microsoft could not have made a few years ago.\n\n\"If you have to meet the customer where they are, where are they?\" said Panay about that choice. \"We think we have something here that is the start of a new category. The opportunity to meet our customers where they are going is so important,\" he said.\n\nNo doubt, by unveiling these devices a year before they will go on sale, which is an unusual move, Microsoft will be hoping to encourage other hardware makers to test out folding Windows tablets, too.\n\nThat dual-screen look might be enticing the developers who wouldn't otherwise consider building their app for Windows. Microsoft is hoping the sum of the Surface device range is greater than the parts.\n\nREAD: Windows 7 vs Windows 10: The next big challenge\n\nSome people may swap their laptop for a folding device, Panay said, while others will have both.\n\n\"With every massive shift in tech, or when that change starts to the happen, the form factor changes too, and that's what we are starting to see here,\" said Panay.\n\nThis is not to say that the new devices will be a success, or even that they will be any good. Just because the industry has latched on to foldable devices as the next big thing that doesn't mean that they will be \u2013 and Microsoft's previous attempts at the smartphone market are well documented.\n\nBut for Microsoft, the Neo and Duo \u2013 and indeed the rest of the Surface range \u2013 are the ultimate physical manifestations of a huge and ongoing shift in Microsoft's strategy.", "description": "These two foldable devices say a lot about where Microsoft thinks it is going next.", "authors": ["Steve Ranger"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/02/494f1569-bed3-4c6c-8e98-90d120d07b33/thumbnail/770x578/b210943ddd547a90f161fe96e99a5c28/surfaceduo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
