The 47-year-old rapper and well-known sports fan was expected to take the minds of players, fans and recruits off the specter of the NCAA investigation and turn attention fully to a season in which the Jayhawks are expected to be title contenders.\n\nThe school even promoted his appearance with a social media video of Hall of Fame coach Bill Self wearing a gaudy chain and Adidas shirt \u2014 the focus of the NCAA inquiry has been on the apparel company\u2019s dealings with recruits, including whether officials paid them to steer them to its schools.\n\nWearing a No. 20 jersey with \u201cSnoop\u201d on the back, the artist performed for about 35 minutes to a full house that included the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams. But he wound up singing unedited versions of several hits, such as \u201cGin and Juice\u201d and \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d as pole dancers performed and fake $100 bills featuring the rapper\u2019s face were shot over players and recruits.\n\nSelf said he wasn\u2019t feeling well and spent most of the performance in the locker room. He later told The Kansas City Star he expected a \u201cradio edited\u201d version of the songs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t guess you have visuals on radio. I learned that tonight,\u201d Self told The Star. \u201cThat\u2019s not the direction anybody at our school would want that to go at all, regardless of any entertainment that it provided many, it was still not the right way to provide the entertainment.\u201d\n\nEspecially given the controversy already surrounding the tradition-rich program.\n\nThe school received a notice from the NCAA late last month alleging three severe violations tied to recruiting and a responsibility charge leveled against Self. Also cited is a lack of institutional control within the program.\n\nThe document does not detail what Kansas is accused of doing. The program is among the most prominent in an NCAA inquiry into a pay-for-play scheme that began with an FBI investigation into the apparel company Adidas.\n\nA former employee for the company later testified that he made payments to the family of one Kansas recruit and the guardian of a current player, and text messages presented in court revealed a close relationship between Self and the Adidas employee.\n\nThe school has said it will appeal and \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the assertion it lacks institutional control.\n\nKansas will be allowed to present its case at a hearing. The NCAA will then rule, often within several months, and the school has the right to appeal.\n\nNorth Carolina State also has received a notice of allegations. Arizona, Auburn, Creighton, Louisville, LSU and Southern California are among those under the NCAA microscope.", "description": "LAWRENCE, Kan.
