Art from the Middle East is outgrowing its \"Orientalist\" straitjacket.\n\nHer work is part of a major exhibition in London's British Museum called Inspired by the East, that explores the significant - yet often unacknowledged - influence of Eastern culture on the West.\n\n\"Discover centuries of art inspired by the Islamic world,\" the museum promises visitors.\n\nCo-curator Julia Tugwell said there has been a resurgence of interest in Orientalist work after it fell out of fashion for years, and she hopes the exhibition can help to reduce barriers thrown up by politics.\n\n\"People might forget that there has been an exchange between East and West for centuries, much longer than we think and while, of course, some of that has been warfare, a lot of it has been diplomatic relations and artistic exchange.\n\n\"Looking at this through an artistic medium and showing how there has been this interest in the 'other' from both directions over the years shows that there has been an ongoing dialogue.\"\n\nOrganised in collaboration with the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia, the exhibition traces Western fascination with the Eastern and Muslim world since the medieval era.\n\nEugene Delacroix (1798\u20131863), Algerian interior.

Iythar, Egyptian-British artist\n\nPoets, writers, musicians and playwrights contributed to a large body of work depicting the \"Orient\" in imaginary terms.\n\nOrientalist scenes often evoked a tranquil, settled way of life that contrasted to the disruptive industrialisation in Europe and America.\n\nSome artists such as Austrian Rudolf Ernst travelled throughout the Middle East and North Africa, while others, like the Italian Ettore Simonetti, remained in their studios, painting imagined landscapes.\n\nThe Islamic faith and figures at prayer became a marker of difference, and the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca was a recurrent theme - as was the harem, with which male European artists took considerable erotic licence.\n\nLeft: Bottle in the Persian (late Safavid) style, glazed and lustre-painted ceramic, France, late 1800s.

There was absolutely no knowledge of this body of information.\n\n\"Soon after the invention of the daguerreotype it was the French who went to Egypt to take photographs of Egyptian antiquity, and very soon there was a massive archive of photography of the region.\"\n\nContemporary resonance\n\nThe concluding section of Inspired by the East displays photographs by contemporary female artists from the Middle East challenging Orientalist depictions of women - often through political compositions.\n\nShirin Neshat's portrait of herself posed as if in prayer next to a rifle is a comment on Muslim female identity referencing the Iranian Revolution.\n\nA self-portrait by Palestinian artist Raeda Saadeh reimagines the passive woman from the harem as a confrontational witness to today's turbulent regional politics.\n\nWilliam Kynan-Wilson of Aalborg University, who discusses the origins of Orientalism in the catalogue, told Al Jazeera Western scholarship has increasingly been uncovering the contribution of Islamic art.\n\nRaeda Saadeh (born 1977), Who will make me real?
