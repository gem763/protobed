Beto O\u2019Rourke said on the debate stage Tuesday night that Americans who refuse to turn over banned semi automatic rifles under his mandatory gun buyback program would be met with unspecified \u201cconsequences,\u201d a stance which drew major pushback from his fellow Democratic contenders.\n\nThe Texas Democrat didn\u2019t get into much more detail, but made clear that police will exercise force to confiscate weapons banned under his plan, the most sweeping gun control proposal offered by any Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cIf someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47...then that weapon will be taken from them,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cIf they persist, there will be other consequences.\"\n\nEvery candidate who addressed the issue on Tuesday evening supported additional restrictions on the sale of so-called assault weapons, but none went as far as O\u2019Rourke. And his proposal prompted a harsh rebuke from others, especially South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cCongressman, you just made it clear you don\u2019t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets,\u201d he told O\u2019Rourke. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal. The problem is not other Democrats who don\u2019t agree with your particular idea of how to handle this. The problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress, and we should be united in taking the fight to them.\u201d\n\nThat drew a heated response from O\u2019Rourke, who accused Buttigieg of minimizing the problem of gun violence and the toll it\u2019s taken on victims of mass-casualty shootings.\n\n\u201cWhen you, mayor, describe this policy as a shiny object, I don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy,\u201d O\u2019Rourke shot back. \u201cBut to those who have survived gun violence, those who have lost a loved one to an AR-15 or an AK-47, marched for our lives, formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politicians and poll-tested politicians, that was a slap in the fact to every one of those groups and every survivor of a mass casualty assault.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would likely require a massive police mobilization to enforce the confiscation of millions of firearms targeted by the plan. And that raised concerns for other candidates on the stage.\n\n\u201cIn the place I grew up in, we weren't exactly looking for more reasons for cops to come show up at the door,\u201d said Julian Castro, the former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cI am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in these communities.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
