Further, cornerback Quinton Dunbar was listed as questionable with a knee injury, while cornerback Fabian Moreau is doubtful with an ankle injury \u2014 potentially leaving Washington\u2019s secondary incredibly thin.\n\nIn related moves, the Redskins placed Guice (knee) and Brantley (foot) on injured reserve Friday \u2014 freeing up two roster spots. Washington filled one of them, however, by promoting wide receiver Robert Davis to the practice squad.\n\nReed will miss his second straight game with a concussion, despite practicing on Wednesday and Thursday. The 29-year-old was not at practice on Friday and coach Jay Gruden said Reed wasn\u2019t feeling \u201c100%\u201d to play in a game. Reed suffered the concussion last month against the Atlanta Falcons in the preseason.\n\nAllen and Brantley both did not practice this week with their respective injuries. Allen suffered a knee sprain against the Philadelphia Eagles, while Brantley re-injured his foot.\n\nAs for the secondary, the Redskins will wait to see if Dunbar will be able to go after the cornerback felt knee soreness on Wednesday. Gruden said if Dunbar can\u2019t go, veteran Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie will start opposite of Josh Norman. Moreau, too, has yet to play this season.\n\n\u201cWe have the guys on the depth chart, that\u2019s who gonna play,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to line them up accordingly, depending on who\u2019s in there and how we decide to do it. The depth chart is up there and we\u2019ll have to decide to line them up.\u201d\n\nIf Dunbar and Moreau are both out, the Redskins will have four cornerbacks on the active roster, when most teams carry five active corners on game day.\n\nWith Guice on injured reserve, the running back will now miss a minimum of eight games. The 22-year-old underwent surgery Thursday to repair a torn meniscus, which he suffered against the Eagles. NFL teams can bring up to two players back from IR when they\u2019re eligible.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
