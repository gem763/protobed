Lately I've been working with the same guy a lot, and I've started to notice my heartbeat rising before I walk into the door. He and I get along very well and have very similar ideologies. We like the same shows and games and have similar hobbies. We end up closing a lot later than normal lately because we talk so much.\n\nThe problem is that he's 22. Normally I wouldn't be okay with such an age difference, but for some reason I really just want to ignore it. I'm really falling in love with him, and I'm not so sure what to do anymore.\n\n\u2014 Crushing\n\nCrushing: Your \u201cnormally\u201d impulse is the right one \u2014 please don\u2019t ignore this age difference.\n\nI should say specifically, don\u2019t act on these feelings, which themselves are normal and okay.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nIt\u2019s just that acting on them, and getting involved with Mr. 22 while you\u2019re still a minor, could land him in a statutory hellscape that no compatible tastes in shows and games could ever justify.\n\nAs the adult in this budding attraction, he is supposed to know this and keep the necessary distance, but humans being humans means it\u2019s better if both of you are respecting the invisible guardrail between you.\n\nBonus old-lady observations: 1. The heart palpitations and like-mindedness on shows and ideas create one of the best feelings in the whole world. 2. These great feelings when it\u2019s just a passing crush are virtually indistinguishable from these great feelings when you\u2019re falling in real love. At least they are at first \u2014 and for a long time, so you typically have no idea which one they\u2019re pointing to until you\u2019re months in and they start to either deepen or vanish so fast you can find yourself on a date with your once-overwhelming crush suddenly wondering what in dog\u2019s name you\u2019re doing there with this person.\n\n3. If there\u2019s already a good reason not to be with someone \u2014 and you have a great one \u2014 then just write the attraction off as a crush and starve it of all attention, hopes and wishful thinking.\n\nEnjoying a crush and the happy mood and the getting-dressed-with-a-little-extra-care moments are not illegal.\n\nBut, reminder, being stupid often is, often for someone else but not for you. So don\u2019t be. Please. If he\u2019s the guy for you, then he will still be right in a couple of years.\n\nRe: Coffee crush: There is no way to say this without sounding creepy, but the relatively close age difference makes things worse for him: old enough to know it's wrong but young enough that he's still making poor judgments and could probably justify the relationship in his head, getting him into a lot of trouble.\n\nI was a student teacher when I was 21 and was propositioned a couple of times. I never acted on it, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted. Looking back, it's scary what could have happened. Statutory hellscape is right.\n\n\u2014 A Guy", "description": "One reason that ignoring the age difference is a bad idea: It could put him in legal jeopardy.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
