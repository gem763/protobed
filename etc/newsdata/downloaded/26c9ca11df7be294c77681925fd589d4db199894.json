That\u2019s normally a good thing, since Google takes this data, hashes what you\u2019re attempting to access, and is only able to sort-of match what you were looking for with your IP address. However, Apple is also sending this data to the Chinese company Tencent in some instances, and there\u2019s a little extra cause for concern \u2014 but odds are good you\u2019re still fine.\n\nJohns Hopkins University professor and professional cryptographer Matthew Greene wrote a detailed blog post about the technology Apple is using for its \u201cFraudulent Website Warning\u201d feature and how it came to be the standard for \u201csafe browsing.\u201d\n\nThe most important point, however, is that the option is on by default for all iOS 13 users. While you can turn it off, your device will be at a much greater risk of malware attacks and phishing scams. Leave it on, however, and your data could be shared with Tencent, a company that isn\u2019t as interested in protecting your privacy as Google.\n\nAs Apple clarified in a statement, data only goes to Tencent if you\u2019re in China. If you\u2019re not, you don\u2019t have to stress \u2014 Google, not Tencent, is analysing the websites you\u2019re visiting to make sure they aren\u2019t trying to scam you. As Apple\u2019s statement reads:\n\n\u201cApple protects user privacy and safeguards your data with Safari Fraudulent Website Warning, a security feature that flags websites known to be malicious in nature. When the feature is enabled, Safari checks the website URL against lists of known websites and displays a warning if the URL the user is visiting is suspected of fraudulent conduct like phishing. To accomplish this task, Safari receives a list of websites known to be malicious from Google, and for devices with their region code set to mainland China, it receives a list from Tencent.\u201d\n\nIf this entire setup is a surprise to you, you\u2019re not alone; the only way you would\u2019ve known was if you read every line of Apple\u2019s safe browsing privacy policy and its fine print, and the company didn\u2019t expressly disclose this elsewhere before or after iOS 13 launched.\n\nWe\u2019ll let you decide whether you\u2019re more comfortable with your Safari browsing data being shared or less-secure browsing. We recommend the former, but if you want to disable the safe browsing feature entirely, go to Settings > Safari and turn off the \u201cFraudulent Website Warning\u201d option. (You can also tap \u201cAbout Safari & Privacy\u201d to view the current privacy policy information.)\n\nWith this turned off, your iPhone will no longer alert you before visiting potentially dangerous websites, so you need to be extra vigilant with your browsing practices.", "description": "iOS 13's \u201cFraudulent Website Warning\u201d feature for Safari mobile shares some of your browsing data by default.
