No policy changes are expected after the ECB launched new stimulus measures (link)just last month.\n\nInvestors took a moment to take a deep breath as there were no major developments on two major forces influencing global markets -- the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit.\n\nJapan's Nikkei gained 0.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced 0.4%. The Shanghai Composite dipped 0.1% while the Shenzhen Composite slipped 0.2%. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.2% while benchmark indexes in Taiwan , Singapore and Indonesia gained. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.3%, while New Zealand's NZX-50 inched up after falling sharply Wednesday following a warning from mining giant Rio Tinto that sparked a selloff (link).\n\nAmong individual stocks, SoftBank (9984.TO) fell in Tokyo trading after announcing a takeover of WeWork (link) the day before. Honda (7267.TO) rose, along with Rakuten (4755.TO) and Inpex (1605.TO) . In Hong Kong, AAC (2018.HK) gained, along with food processor WH Group (0288.HK) and New World Development (0017.HK) . Chip maker SK Hynix (000660.SE) advanced in South Korea despite an 89% year-over-year plunge in third-quarter net profit (link), which was actually better than analysts feared. Rio Tinto (RIO.LN) and Oil Search (OSH.AU) gained in Australia. In New Zealand, Meridian Energy (MEL.NZ) , the nation's largest company by market cap, was stable after plunging 8% on Wednesday.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 23:16 ET (03:16 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
