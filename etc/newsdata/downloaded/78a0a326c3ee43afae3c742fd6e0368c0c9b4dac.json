Liverpool don't want him, they've got Jurgen Klopp. Pep (Guardiola) is at Manchester City, they don't want him.\n\n\"Where is going to go with a better team than what Tottenham have got? There isn't one around, with a better stadium, better training ground and in England.\n\n\"OK, if Real Madrid comes up and he may fancy going to Spain, obviously being from Argentina. The language wouldn't be a problem and living in Madrid would be very nice. Managing a club like Real Madrid, if that came up I'm sure it would be a difficult one for him to turn down.\n\n(Image: James Marsh/BPI/REX)\n\n\"But other than that, I don't see where he goes. Manchester United? Maybe but Pochettino is not silly, he knows he's got a massive rebuilding job there.\n\n\"Manchester United gave it to David Moyes who did wonderful at Everton . Then they gave it to Louis van Gaal who is one of the world's great managers. Then they gave it to Jose Mourinho who has won everything there is to win. They couldn't turn it around.\n\n\"Now Ole is struggling with it. Poch is not silly. He knows there is a long-term rebuilding process and that could take years.\"\n\nWhile Spurs strengthened their ranks in pre-season with the \u00a365million arrival of record signing Tanguy Ndombele, they also endured a summer of uncertainty with Christian Eriksen among the first-team stars linked with a move elsewhere.\n\n(Image: McDonald's)\n\n(Image: McDonald's)\n\nEriksen was expected to leave Spurs this summer, having said that he was looking for a new challenge, but has now entered the final year of his contract after the big move to Europe he was hoping for never materialised.\n\nJan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld are also out of contract in the summer, while Danny Rose almost joined Watford but eventually stayed put too.\n\nAnd Redknapp says those players, plus Dele Alli, need to focus on improving their performances on the pitch if Spurs are to overcome their woes.\n\nHe added: \"The problem they have got is those players who wanted a move are maybe not playing particularly well. Eriksen's form has not been what it was. I think he's a great player. There are a few of them who haven't been playing so well.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n\"Dele Alli, who I think is amazing, has gone bang off the boil at the moment. He needs to find his form again. They are not firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"The two centre halves as well (Vertonghen and Alderweireld) - the two Belgian boys - they have to start performing.\n\n\"Danny Rose has not been in the best of form either. But I'm sure they'll find their form and when they do, they'll have a run. I see them finishing third again.\"\n\nHarry Redknapp was speaking at a McDonald\u2019s Fun Football Session where he helped deliver the 2,000,000th hour of the Fun Football programme.
