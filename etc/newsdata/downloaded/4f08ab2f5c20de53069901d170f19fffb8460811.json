It\u2019s Ghost Recon: Breakpoint\u2019s turn to serve us with the all-too-familiar Ubi-formula of a huge open map filled with a thousand little icons to explore.\n\nIt isn\u2019t Ghost Recon\u2019s first foray into open world territory; 2017\u2019s Ghost Recon: Wildlands was Ubisoft\u2019s previous attempt to apply this format to the tactical shooter series. Unfortunately I\u2019ve never played it, I was led to believe Wildlands was best enjoyed in co-op with a couple of friends, and my little gaming crew never got around to it. This time around, I convinced the boys to start playing Breakpoint with me.\n\nGhost Recon: Breakpoint is set 4 years after the events of Wildlands. The real-world Bolivia locale from the previous game is swapped out for a fictional island, called Auroa. The opening minutes of the game show a \u2018Libertarian utopia\u2019 city that has gone off the radar, and the player character being sent to investigate, only to have their helicopter taken down by swarm of hostile drones.\n\nShortly after the intro you encounter the game\u2019s main antagonist (played by Punisher-actor Jon Bernthal) and you get introduced to the game\u2019s main hub area, Erewhon. After that, you\u2019re free to explore Auroa on your own. Either by vehicle, helicopter, or on foot.\n\nThe island is overrun by bad guys, but you get a decent arsenal to deal with them. There\u2019s a big variety of guns, an assortment of consumable items like medkits and grenades, and, most importantly: your drone. You can deploy your drone whenever you want and fly it around to scout enemy locations and other hazards. These get conveniently marked in your UI, so you can easily keep tabs on your foes.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to utilize every tool in your arsenal if you want to stand a chance, because the opposition is vicious. Breakpoint is not made to be played like an action game; it basically begs you to take your time, plan your attack, and be very wary of your surroundings. When you play by the game\u2019s rules, it\u2019s enjoyable \u2014 sometimes even satisfying. Simply scouting out an entire camp, picking off enemies one-by-one with your sniper rifle, and stealthily making your way to the objective feels good. It\u2019s especially fun if you do it with a group of friends that wants to play by the game\u2019s rules too \u2014 but you\u2019ll have to find some very patient friends.\n\nUnfortunately, mine weren\u2019t. After encountering a plethora of weird bugs and egregious microtransactions, my friends bailed on me, and I don\u2019t blame them. Breakpoint reminds me of how bad Assassin\u2019s Creed: Unity was at launch. Missing guns, flying player models, disappearing helicopters, frozen NPCs; we\u2019ve seen it all. The performance isn\u2019t as bad as Unity\u2019s (on my PS4 Pro at least), so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s unplayable. The bugs just constantly take you out of the immersion. See for yourself:\n\nAfter my friends dumped me, I decided to give it a go on my own, only to be frustrated by how Breakpoint feels when you don\u2019t play exactly by its rules. Like I said, it\u2019s all fun and games when you\u2019re sneaking around undetected, but as soon as you\u2019re spotted by one of the many soldiers, drones, tanks, or helicopters, you\u2019re fucked. These scenarios have always been a problem for games that emphasize stealth, but I have rarely been as frustrated as with Breakpoint. It\u2019s simply not fun to fight a massive tank drone with a sniper rifle and a health bar that depletes after a handful of enemy bullets.\n\nEven if everything worked perfectly, Breakpoint still would have little to offer that other Ubisoft games with the same formula don\u2019t already. The worlds and the stealth action in Assassin\u2019s Creed games are vastly more interesting \u2014 blowing shit up with helicopters is better done in the Far Cry series, and if you\u2019re looking for a good co-op military shooter you\u2019re better off playing The Division 2. You can also just buy Wildlands for about half the price of Breakpoint. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do, I just hope my friends are down to give it another go.\n\nRead next: The 4 biggest product launch mistakes \u2014 and how to avoid them", "description": "Even if everything worked perfectly, Breakpoint still would have little to offer that other Ubisoft games with the same formula don\u2019t.", "authors": ["Nino De Vries"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F2510225d95d8619bc522.69295210-GRB_screen_LAUNCH_Water-Crossing_191003_6pm_CET.jpg&signature=bcc65e6ef524a684564af978475026b4", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
