My hair grew back in time for high school but unfortunately the damage to my self-esteem had already been done.\n\n\u2018I lost all of it by my 30s and, as a result, I went through life making mistakes and poor decisions, often giving away my power and allowing others to treat me badly.\u2019\n\nBut now the 41-year-old is on a mission to spread self-love and positivity. Starting with herself.\n\n\u2018I realised how much I had allowed my alopecia to effect my self-esteem over the years and just how much my lack of self-love had negatively impacted my entire life,\u2019 says Victoria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So, I made a decision there and then to focus on the positives of my condition, to celebrate who I was, to remind myself of my strengths and give myself a dose of well over-due self-love.\n\n\u2018It was like a light going on, my life immediately began to change for the better and the happier and more confident I became.\u2019\n\n\u2018I made a decision there and then to focus on the positives of my condition, to celebrate who I was\u2019 (Picture: Victoria Lysaght)\n\nSix months ago, Victoria, who works as an illustrator, had a chance encounter with an incredible woman who changed the course of Victoria\u2019s life.\n\n\u2018It was a normal, rainy Manchester morning and I received a message from a bubbly, energetic lady inquiring about booking one of my \u201cWonderful Me\u201d doodle workshops.\n\n\u2018The lady turned out to be the female founder of a women\u2019s running club called Solemother. Curiosity got the better of me, so I signed myself up to the group on Facebook \u2013 more to be nosey than to actually run!\u2019\n\n\u2018I received so many comments from others to say how I\u2019d helped to inspire them to be themselves\u2019 (Picture: Victoria Lysaght)\n\nBut there was something about the club that struck a chord with Victoria, and she knew she had to give it a try.\n\n\u2018It didn\u2019t take me long to realise this was a very special running club,\u2019 she explains. \u2018Everyone was welcome, whatever your ability or circumstance, and everyone was treated equally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But the main thing that struck me was the supportive, non-competitive vibe.\n\n\u2018Women were sharing their achievements to inspire and motivate each other and instead of competing, they were cheering each other on, offering nothing but love, respect and admiration for each other.\u2019\n\nBut there was one small problem \u2013 Victoria didn\u2019t feel at all confident with her running abilities. She had been a strong runner when she was younger, but losing her hair sapped her of her confidence.\n\n\u2018When I lost my hair in my thirties, my enthusiasm for running had disappeared along with it,\u2019 she says. \u2018Running with a wig was hot and uncomfortable, so I had given in to my condition and avoided any exercise that made me too sweaty.\u2019\n\n\u2018I soon realised that if I was going to complete the race, the wig had to go\u2019 (Picture: Victoria Lysaght)\n\nDespite her reservations, Victoria felt inspired by reading the stories of other women in the group \u2013 so she signed up, dusted off her trainers and started running again.\n\n\u2018It felt so good,\u2019 she says. \u2018I could feel a huge improvement in my mental health. I often suffer with stress and anxiety and struggle to relax, but I would come back from a run feeling uplifted and in such a positive place. It has become my meditation.\u2019\n\nIn what Victoria calls a \u2018moment of madness\u2019, she found herself signing up for the Manchester Half Marathon.\n\n\u2018The furthest I had ever run was 10k, so a half marathon was a huge jump for me \u2013 I was pretty scared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Once I started training for the event, I soon realised that if I was going to complete the race, the wig had to go.\n\n\u2018So during, one of my morning runs around my local town, I ditched the wig and ran bald for the last 5k. It felt amazing.\n\n\u2018It was much cooler, much more comfortable and because I was being brave enough to show the world the real me, I felt hugely empowered.\u2019\n\nFrom then on, there was no looking back for Victoria, and wig-free runs became the norm. She felt incredible being able to embrace her appearance without any embarrassment or shame.\n\n\u2018I not only received support from the ladies in the club, but from the whole community,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018People helped me reach my sponsorship target in just 24 hours after I shared a photo of myself on Facebook after my first bald run.\n\n\u2018I received so many comments from others to say how I\u2019d helped to inspire them to be themselves which made me feel so happy.\u2019\n\nVictoria was even more delighted when she received a letter from the Trafford Sports Awards to say she had been nominated for the Changing Lifestyle Award \u2013 which she went on to win.\n\n\u2018I threw my wig on the table in front of everyone, and marched up to the front\u2019 (Picture: Victoria Lysaght)\n\n\u2018When I went up to accept my award, I knew I had to be brave and accept the award as the \u201creal me\u201d so I threw my wig on the table in front of everyone, and marched up to the front!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It felt incredible! I now go on to represent Trafford in The Greater Manchester Final on 15 November.\u2019\n\nEarlier this month, Victoria completed the Manchester Half Marathon in 2 hours 20 minutes \u2013 completely bald and with the biggest smile on her face.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what I\u2019ve achieved, but the true satisfaction comes from inspiring others.\u2019\n\nStrong Women Strong Women is a weekly series that champions diversity in the world of sport and fitness. A Sport England study found that 40% of women were avoiding physical activity due to a fear of judgement. But, contrary to the limited images we so often see, women of any age, size, race or ability can be active and enjoy sport and fitness. We hope that by normalising diverse depictions of women who are fit, strong and love their bodies, we will empower all women to shed their self-consciousness when it comes to getting active. Each week we talk to women who are redefining what it means to be strong and achieving incredible things.\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018Female jockeys are just as good as men\u2019\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018Two of my friends took their own lives \u2013 now I\u2019m walking 1,300 miles to raise awareness\u2019\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018I was struggling to cope with my husband\u2019s MS \u2013 mountain biking brought me back from the brink\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Victoria lost her hair to alopecia in her 30s.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris", "Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/strong-women-37-2322_1571470240.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
