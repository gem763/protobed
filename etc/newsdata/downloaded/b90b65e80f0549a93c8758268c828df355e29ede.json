That\u2019s the real vandalism to democracy that\u2019s going on \u2026 so I regret it and we need to keep the family together, but the prime minister was very clear.\u201d\n\nQ&A Who were the rebel Tories? Show Hide Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government on Tuesday night\u2019s motion to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit. Guto Bebb, Aberconwy Richard Benyon, Newbury Steve Brine, Winchester Alistair Burt, North East Bedfordshire Greg Clark, Tunbridge Wells Kenneth Clarke, Rushcliffe David Gauke, South West Hertfordshire Justine Greening, Putney Dominic Grieve, Beaconsfield Sam Gyimah, East Surrey Philip Hammond, Runnymede and Weybridge Stephen Hammond, Wimbledon Richard Harrington, Watford Margot James, Stourbridge Sir Oliver Letwin, West Dorset Anne Milton, Guildford Caroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton North Antoinette Sandbach, Eddisbury Sir Nicholas Soames, Mid Sussex Rory Stewart, Penrith and The Border Edward Vaizey, Wantage\n\n\n\nRudd told the BBC on Sunday morning she felt she had little choice but to resign after colleagues had lost the whip for backing Hilary Benn\u2019s bill instructing the prime minister to ask for a delay to leaving the EU on 31 October and in effect blocking a no-deal departure.\n\nPlay Video 1:01 Rudd explains why she quit Boris Johnson's cabinet \u2013 video\n\n\u201cI know I couldn\u2019t carry on in the Conservative party at such a high level and see 21 of my colleagues who are good, moderate people, who also want a deal, excluded from it, and I just needed to move and stand by them,\u201d she told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show.\n\nShe said there was a \u201chuge machine\u201d preparing for a no-deal Brexit, which was taking up \u201c80-90% of government time\u201d; but when she had asked No 10 earlier this week for an update on the work going into the negotiations, she had been sent a one-page summary.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge amount of planning and preparation around no deal. I have attended a number of those meetings. We are really stepping it up, which is the right thing to do, but I have not seen enough work going into actually trying to get a deal.\u201d\n\nRudd insisted she did not regret joining Johnson\u2019s cabinet, which required signing up to his plan to leave the EU by 31 October, come what may. \u201cI entered in good faith, had frank conversations with the PM, and when I said I supported him on his strategy I was absolutely genuine.\u201d\n\nRaab said his former cabinet colleague had signed up to Johnson\u2019s plan to leave the EU at the end of October come what may, and that extensive no-deal planning was crucial to getting a deal, but the government was also working on solutions to present to the EU. This included plans being worked up on technological \u201cpossibilities\u201d on the Northern Irish border to avoid using the backstop arrangement.\n\nAsked by Ridge if the prime minister would ignore the legislation passed in parliament asking him to seek a delay to Brexit, Raab said the government would test its legality to the limits and could not rule out that a legal challenge would be brought in the future.\n\nHe said the prime minister was absolutely committed to not asking Brussels for an extension.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will adhere to the law but also this is such a bad piece of legislation \u2026 we will also want to test to the limit what it does actually lawfully require.\n\n\u201cWe will look very carefully at the implications and our interpretation of it.\u201d\n\nThe court challenge may come from outside government, he added. \u201cWe can\u2019t necessarily control that,\u201d he said, on exactly who would bring a legal case.\n\n\u201cPeople at various points challenged the government over Brexit. We had two legal challenges last week alone and we won both of those,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether the prime minister would resign rather than ask for an extension to Brexit, he ducked the question and said: \u201cWe are always going to behave lawfully as a government.\u201d\n\nAccusations that the prime minister\u2019s chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, is not a Conservative party member were batted away by the minister.\n\nCummings has been blamed by many Tory MPs this week for the much stricter treatment of Brexit rebels and for narrowing down the party\u2019s appeal by focusing solely on leaving the EU.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to ask him.\u201d", "description": "Foreign secretary blames Tory rebels for \u2018vandalism\u2019 after criticism from Amber Rudd", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e46e01b22424f4e72dd611e77890de5527f5a52a/0_114_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7da0493bacc1e9bc1bed7080cf7a28a", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
