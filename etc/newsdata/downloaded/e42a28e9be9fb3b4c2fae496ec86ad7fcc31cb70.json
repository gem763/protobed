In a research note, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney makes the case that Google Maps and Waze are \u201dburied treasure,\u201d one of the least monetized platforms on the internet with more than a billion users. Mahaney notes that data show over 75% of smartphone owners regularly use navigation apps\u2014and that Alphabet\u2019s Google has a market share of better than 80%.\n\nGoogle, he says, has competitive advantages in digital maps, with a lead in data collection and map-creating automation using satellite and Street View imagery, plus machine learning and computer-vision technology. Google recently announced expanded access to its Local Campaigns program, making it available to a broader set of advertisers, and with new actions, like clickable calls and directions. And Google has collected enough data through Waze, he says, \u201cto roll out more solutions for advertisers in Maps without severely impacting the user experience.\u201d\n\nRBC ran more than 400 mobile keyword searches on Google Maps across 15 U.S. cities and six international cities and found advertising load levels about half those for Google Maps on desktop\u2014evidence that \u201cGoogle Maps has a long way to further monetization\u201d of mobile maps.\n\nMaps could generate $1.9 billion to $3.6 billion in additional 2021 revenue, he says. Mahaney, who has an Outperform rating on Alphabet shares, raised his price target to $1,500 from $1,425. \u201cMaps isn\u2019t a thesis changer, \u201cbut it may well provide Google with yet another lever to maintain its impressive 20%-plus revenue growth for nine-plus years at massive scale.\u201d\n\nLast Week\n\nStocks Swim Upstream\n\nTrade sentiment waxed and waned, German manufacturing cast a pall, public offerings sank, and an impeachment tempest blew in. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, reports surfaced that the White House was mulling delisting Chinese companies and limiting U.S. investments in China. Well, it could have been worse. For the week, the Dow industrials shed 0.4%, to 26,820.25; the S&P 500 lost 1%, to 2961.79; and the Nasdaq Composite thudded 2.2%, to 7939.63.\n\nTrump and Ukraine\n\nA whistle-blower charge that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating former Vice President and Democratic candidate for president Joe Biden, and his son, gave new life to impeachment. As both Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani admitted that they urged Ukraine to investigate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to an impeachment inquiry. A transcript of a Trump call with the Ukraine president and the whistle-blower complaint then tossed gasoline on the fire.\n\nRepo Market Rescue\n\nThe New York Federal Reserve\u2019s injection of liquidity into the repurchase market isn\u2019t over. The Fed made $50 billion available to the markets on Monday, then more than doubled that by midweek. The liquidity problems seem to be fallout from the draining of reserves from the system. Fears have also arisen over a new benchmark, the secured overnight funding rate, or SOFR, designed to replace the London interbank offered rate in 2021. SOFR is based on repo rates.\n\nJohnson Loses Again\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson absorbed another defeat when the Supreme Court, in an 11-0 vote, declared that his move to suspend Parliament was unlawful. Parliament then reconvened, with Johnson facing a majority opposition, which has already passed a law saying the U.K. could not leave the European Union without a deal. Johnson has promised an exit on Oct. 31, \u201cdo or die.\u201d In a raucous debate, Johnson demanded a no-confidence vote on his own government so he could call elections, but was again blocked.\n\nWeWork\u2019s CEO Steps Down\n\nAdam Neumann, the co-founder and CEO of WeWork, stepped down after an initial public offering had to be postponed. Neumann will remain the nonexecutive chairman of the board of WeWork\u2019s parent, We Co.\n\nThe Week in Deals\n\nTalks between Altria Group and Philip Morris International broke off, in part because of the vaping crisis at Altria investment Juul Labs\u2026Shares of fitness company Peloton Interactive fell 11% on its debut from an initial offering price of $29. Endeavour Group then called off its IPO\u2026Tesla\u2019s board must defend Elon Musk\u2019s compensation in Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery.\n\nWrite to Eric J.
