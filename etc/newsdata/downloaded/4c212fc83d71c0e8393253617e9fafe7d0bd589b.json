Biden.\n\nThe intelligence community inspector general said the complaint had to be forwarded to Congress quickly because it was both \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nMichael K. Atkinson, the inspector general, said in the report that President Trump\u2019s own executive order highlighting the danger of foreign influence in elections fed the determination that the whistleblower complaint was urgent enough to be flagged for Congress.\n\nThat September 2018 executive order declared foreign influence in elections an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Adam Schiff to acting DNI Joe Maguire: \u2018You stood silent\u2019\n\nMr. Atkinson said given that, the complaint needed to be shared with Congress.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s Aug. 12 complaint and the IG report were released Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint has reinvigorated House Democrats\u2019 efforts to impeach Mr. Trump.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department on Wednesday said it had cleared Mr. Trump of violating campaign finance laws, saying the request for a corruption probe did not amount to an item of value provided to the Trump reelection campaign.\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower describes having \u201curgent concern\u201d about Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and what the complaint describes as White House attempts to cover it up.\n\n\u201cIn the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript for eh call that was proceeded \u2014 as is customary \u2014 by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nMr. Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption stemming from Mr. Biden\u2019s visit as vice president to Kyiv in 2016. During the visit, Mr. Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country\u2019s leaders fire Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor.\n\nThe prosecutor was looking into a Ukraine gas company where Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, had a high-paying position on the board.\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower describes Mr. Trump\u2019s actions as \u201cpressuring a foreign county to investigate one fo the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d\n\nThe complainant said the president\u2019s conduct potentially posed \u201crisks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nMany of the details in the complaint have already been leaked to the news media. The White House also released a transcipt of the July 25 call in which Mr. Trump asks for the investigation but does not suggest a quid pro quo for U.S. military aid.\n\nThe whistleblower, who did not have first-hand knowledge of the phone call or related events, said the information was passed on by a half dozen administration officials who were alarmed by the goings ons at the White House.\n\nThe complainant says he gained knowledge of the events as follows:\n\n\u201cOver the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed me of various facts related to this effort. The information provided herein was relayed to me in the course of official interagency business. It is routine for U.S. officials with responsibility for a particular regional or functional portfolio to share such information with one another in order to inform policymaking and analysis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not a direct witness to most of the events described. However, I found my colleagues\u2019 account of these events to be credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patters that were consistent with one another. In addition, a variety of information consistent with these private accounts has been reported publicly,\u201d wrote the whistleblower.\n\nMr. Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption stemming from Mr. Biden\u2019s visit as vice president to Kiev in 2016. During the visit, Mr. Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country\u2019s leaders fire Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor.\n\nThe prosecutor was looking into a Ukraine gas company where Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, had a high-paying position on the board.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
