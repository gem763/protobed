Of those, 83 were enforced and 49 were overturned on video review. There were 171 targeting penalties called at this point in 2018. Of those, 122 were enforced and 49 were overturned.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to know how precisely to attribute the decline, but it is a significant drop,\u201d national coordinator of football officials Rogers Redding said.\n\nRedding pointed to three possible factors: players using better tackling technique, the removal of \u201cstands\u201d as called on the field as a review option and the threat of a one-game suspension for three targeting fouls in the same season.\n\n\u201cThe main reason is that coaches and players have responded,\u201d Redding said. \u201cWe anecdotally see player behavior changing, although we can\u2019t prove it. This is difficult to quantify, but it comes from several (officials) coordinators and me, based on years of experience with this rule.\u201d\n\nVideo review officials are now required to overturn targeting calls if any element of the penalty cannot be confirmed. Previously, video review officials could let the call on the field stand. Redding said about 11 percent of reviews resulted in \u201cstands\u201d in 2018. Redding said in the unlikely event all of those \u201cstands\u201d were reversed under 2019 rules, it still would not totally account for the decrease.\n\nA player committing a targeting foul is ejected for the remainder of the game in addition to his team being penalized 15 yards. If the foul occurs after halftime, the player is ejected and must sit out the first half of his team\u2019s next game.\n\nThis year the NCAA passed a \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule that calls for a player to be suspended for the entirety of his next game if he has three targeting fouls in the same season.\n\n\u201cThe specter of the progressive penalty - three strikes and you\u2019re out - might give coaches and players pause,\u201d Redding said, \u201csince now history matters when it didn\u2019t previously.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The number of enforced targeting penalties is down 32% in the Football Bowl Subdivision compared with the first seven weeks of the 2018 season, the NCAA said Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
