Ultimately what he is doing is trying to implement the processes Sir Alex had in place prior to his retirement.\n\n\"I think that is a huge ask. Remember Sir Alex went years prior to winning his first trophy and that will be very, very difficult to replicate because of the modern-day pressures.\n\n\"Having said that, if things are moving in the right direction then he will get some time. I also think Ole is a character that\u2019s not putting himself front and centre; he\u2019s putting his club front and centre.\n\n\"So he will be part of a process moving forward to make United successful again, and I don\u2019t think he makes any qualms about that. I think that is something to be applauded and respected.\"", "description": "United have made their worst start to a season for 30 years - and Mark Robins says there is no quick fix", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554751.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
