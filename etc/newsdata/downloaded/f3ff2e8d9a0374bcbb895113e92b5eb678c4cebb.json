The abandonment of the Kurds, stalwart allies in the region who have lost 11,000 fighters in the battle against ISIS, triggered a storm of bipartisan criticism.\n\n\n\nNATO ally Turkey says the offensive is necessary to drive away Syrian Kurdish forces, which it considers linked to Kurdish separatists waging an insurgency on its own soil. It says it plans to repopulate a strip along the Turkish border with about 2 million Syrian refugees currently sheltering in Turkey.\n\nMost of the U.S. troops who once fought alongside Syrian Kurdish forces will now be based in western Iraq, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in an apparent backtracking on Trump\u2019s earlier pledge that the U.S. forces would be brought \u201cback home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current game plan is for those forces to re-position into western Iraq,\u201d Esper said to journalists on a flight to Afghanistan, adding the U.S. forces would be deployed to \u201chelp defend Iraq\u201d and counter any efforts by ISIS to re-establish itself. About 5,000 U.S. troops are already stationed in Iraq.\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds is as incoherent as it is dangerous.\n\nSeparately, Trump is said to be considering a plan to keep about a small contingent of about 200 troops in eastern Syria, along the Iraqi border area, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe proposal was intended to prevent an ISIS resurgence in the region, and block Syrian regime forces from seizing Kurdish-held oil fields in the east, according to the Times. Esper said he had not made a decision on that proposal yet, or presented it to Trump.\n\nAs U.S. forces withdrew, Kurdish forces evacuated from the contested border town of Ras al-Ain Sunday as part of a U.S.-brokered temporary ceasefire agreement with Turkey. Under the terms of the deal, struck between the U.S. and Turkey last week, Turkey is insisting Kurdish forces withdraw from what it calls a \u201csafe zone\u201d along its border.\n\nREAD: Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s \u2018great\u2019 ceasefire deal is going.\n\nEach side has accused the other of breaching the truce. On Saturday, Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that if Kurdish forces haven't left the region by Tuesday night, when the ceasefire is due to end, \u201cwe will start where we left off, and continue to crush the terrorists\u2019 heads.\u201d\n\nErdogan is due to discuss his Syrian offensive during a meeting in the Russian city of Sochi Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose influence over the future of the country has only grown since the U.S. withdrawal.\n\nCover: American military convoy stops near the town of Tel Tamr, north Syria, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019.
