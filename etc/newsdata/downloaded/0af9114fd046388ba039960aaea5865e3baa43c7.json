Photo: John Minchillo\n\nMost weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, what last night\u2019s debate tells us about the Democratic field.\n\nLast night was the first Democratic primary debate since Congress opened its official impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump. Did that change anything?\n\nThe opening question, a softball about impeachment, allowed every last one of the 12 candidates on the overcrowded stage to tell us what we already know: They are all for it! So the advent of the impeachment inquiry per se didn\u2019t change anything. But once we moved beyond that dull panorama of like-mindedness, this turned out to be a clarifying debate. By that I don\u2019t mean it was an exciting debate, or an inspiring debate, or a debate that would draw in those Americans (most of them) who don\u2019t want to think about 2020 politics before we get to 2020. But the shape of the Democratic field now seems crystal clear. Tuesday night seemed like a death knell for seven of the dozen candidacies on stage, including Joe Biden\u2019s. It\u2019s time for the actual contenders to go at it on a less cluttered field.\n\nAmong the seven also-rans, the low-hanging losers are Beto O\u2019Rourke, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Tom Steyer (we hardly knew ye), the billionaire vanity candidate whose main attribute is that at least he is not Howard Schultz. Their time to gain traction in this cycle has come and gone. Obviously O\u2019Rourke and Castro are future prospects, though it may take a while for some Democrats to forgive O\u2019Rourke for his vainglorious decision to run for president rather than to challenge the incumbent John Cornyn in next year\u2019s Texas Senate race.\n\nCory Booker and Biden, two candidates who\u2019ve always looked highly plausible in theory but repeatedly fail to deliver, are more complicated cases.\n\nBooker is sunny and personable \u2014 as unobjectionable as an easy-listening radio host. His upbeat, why-can\u2019t-we-all-get-along shtick is surely sincere, but it\u2019s part of the reason why he\u2019s never risen in the polls: It comes off as empty bombast \u2014 cheery bombast, to be sure, but no substitute for substance. In a dark time, voters are not looking for a \u201cpolitics of joy,\u201d to recall the thesis of Hubert Humphrey\u2019s ill-fated campaign in 1968. And they aren\u2019t looking for rage, a market that has been cornered by Trump in any event. What they are looking for is fight. Booker has yet to show that he has much of that, despite his periodic pumping up of his mellifluous voice to simulate fisticuffs.\n\nIn last night\u2019s debate, he also revealed just how hard it is for him to depart from his over-polished prefab scripts. It was somewhat embarrassing when, in an obviously planned bit of grandstanding, he (politely) chastised his rivals for neglecting to talk about how much women\u2019s reproductive rights are under attack \u2014 only moments after Kamala Harris had made the exact same point, and stirringly so. Booker\u2019s attempt to concede that she\u2019d upstaged him was awkward (a patronizing \u201cGod bless Kamala!\u201d) as was his effort to draw a distinction by congratulating himself on being a man who cares about women\u2019s reproductive rights. (It was just grating enough to recall his mortifying \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d gambit during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.) In another demonstration of his lack of intellectual agility, he glowingly quoted the former Trump defense secretary, Jim Mattis, while making no reference to Mattis\u2019s recently much-discussed cowardice in failing to speak up about the White House horrors that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBiden also lacks that intellectual agility. He didn\u2019t repeat the viral glitches of the previous debates. But that\u2019s a low bar to rise above. Like Booker, he seems incapable of the improvisational moves necessary to take on Trump. He ducked a question about why it was okay for Hunter Biden to trade on his name for cushy foreign paydays, however lawfully, and instead repeated an anodyne soundbite three times (\u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself\u201d). This was a lost opportunity because Biden might have joined other Democrats in denouncing the nepotistic follies of his hypocritical Republican critics, notably Donald Trump Jr., Rand Paul, and Liz Cheney. And he might have passionately lit into the criminal White House conspiracy to strongarm foreign governments to soil him and his son. After all, Trump\u2019s assault on the Bidens is the best argument for his candidacy \u2014 it makes the case that Joe Biden is the candidate Trump fears the most. But unaccountably Biden has made only fitful use of this political gift horse in the weeks since the Ukraine scandal became front-page news \u2014 even as his campaign\u2019s fundraising has wilted.\n\nThere were other examples of his lack of improvisational skills as well. After delivering a meaty tirade against the outrage of Trump\u2019s surrender to Erdogan and Assad, he ducked the question of whether he\u2019d send American troops back into the region. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from repeating more than once his newly favored shtick (intended as a stab at Warren) trumpeting himself as the only candidate who\u2019s gotten anything done. That claim is not only false, but is wielded as a dodge to avoid any treacherous policy question. Worse, it left him open to this memorable riposte from Bernie Sanders: \u201cYou got the disastrous war in Iraq done.\u201d Sanders damaged Biden in a less explicit way as well. Post\u2013heart attack, he seemed looser, sharper, and less programmed than he did pre\u2013heart attack. He seems younger than Biden though in fact he\u2019s two years his senior. Who would have ever imagined that Bernie Sanders could be a comeback kid?\n\nAmong the others still left standing, Kamala Harris remains an enigma. She\u2019s a sharp and tireless prosecutor (as she never hesitates to remind us), capable of real fire when she\u2019s passionate about the subject at hand. But she\u2019s just as often studied and cautious, and you have to wonder about her political acuity when she marshals her considerable resources to push such a marginal, Bay Area\u2013centric crusade as calling upon Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account.\n\nAs nearly everyone has noted, the two who did themselves the most good last night were Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who seized the initiative and poked holes in the best-laid Medicare for All plans of front-runner Elizabeth Warren. Their blows, respectful but firm, landed.\n\nFor the first time in a debate, Warren occasionally seemed defensive and misspoke. She will not be able to get away indefinitely with stonewalling Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cyes or no question\u201d about whether her health plan mandates tax increases. At another point, she could be found self-righteously claiming that \u201ceveryone else on this stage\u201d wants to protect billionaires even though, as Klobuchar pointed out, even the one billionaire onstage, Steyer, had come out against protecting billionaires.\n\nAs of now, Warren remains the best candidate the Democrats have, but she hasn\u2019t closed the deal, and there are plausible alternatives. Talking heads at CNN and elsewhere relentlessly promoted last night\u2019s debate as historic because it was the most presidential candidates ever on a debate stage. But only after a ruthless culling will the campaign finally begin in earnest and real history be made.\n\nBut what about Michael Bloomberg? He has begun to float the idea of entering the Democratic primary as a centrist option if Biden falters. Would he be a contender?\n\nAt 77, he would at last remedy a glaring shortcoming of the septuagenarian Democratic field by filling the age gap between Biden (76) and Sanders (78). And it would be highly gratifying to see a genuinely successful and accomplished New York billionaire go up against the fraud in the White House. He might drive Trump crazy \u2014 that is, crazier \u2014 and he could be self-financing to an extent.\n\nThe downside? Trump\u2019s revenge, make no mistake about it, would be to further stoke anti-Semitism among his alt-right stormtroopers. And should either Buttigieg, Klobuchar, or Harris catch fire with Biden\u2019s up-for-grabs constituency, a tardy Bloomberg candidacy would be fighting a two-front war against opponents both in the party\u2019s center and on the left. If he really wants to get in when Biden falters, someone should tell him that that time has arrived.", "description": "Tuesday night seemed like a death knell for seven of the dozen candidacies on stage \u2013 including Joe Biden\u2019s.", "authors": ["Frank Rich"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/15/15-warren-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
