Fitch Rtgs: Track Record Key for New Lenders in Australian Securitisations\n\n(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Sydney-October 09: The assignment of investment-grade ratings to securitisation transactions by new lenders in Australia depends on whether they can establish a stable set of underwriting criteria, a viable business model and a reliable asset performance track record over a considerable period of time, Fitch Ratings says. Australia in 2019 granted full banking licences to four start-up banks (86400, Judo Bank, Volt Bank and Xinja Bank), and saw significant growth in the \"buy now, pay later\" sector (AfterPay and Zip Money). In addition, existing lenders have expanded their product ranges, typically from mortgages to other secured or unsecured consumer lending, and three lenders came to the securitisation market for the first time (Pepper Asset Finance, Zip Money and Wingate). In addition, the enabling legislation to establish the AUD2 billion Australian Business Securitisation Fund (ABSF) received the last approval to pass into law in April 2019. The Australian government established the ABSF to boost competition in the SME lending market, and to improve access to, and the price of, finance available to SMEs by investing in warehouses and the securitisation market. The rise of new lenders has the potential to change the financing landscape in Australia, with many of the new lenders seeking to use technology to originate and service new products in their target markets. This will result in increased competition for existing lenders in the residential mortgage, SME, auto, equipment and personal-lending markets.\n\nLenders entering new markets need time and proprietary data to develop stable underwriting policies and to adjust policies to stabilise and optimize performance. New lenders may suffer from adverse selection, in which they are only shown potential transactions that established lenders may have previously rejected, thus steering their portfolio towards borrowers with weaker credit quality. As lenders mature, such problems should become less prominent. When Fitch reviews issuers and lenders for the first time to determine if their transactions can be rated and whether a rating cap is appropriate, Fitch seeks historical performance data for at least five years for each product that is proposed to be securitised. Fitch's rating criteria expect historic data to cover a number of origination vintages where the loans have matured and completed their full life cycles. Ideally, historical data will include data derived under economic stress, although new lenders in Australia are unlikely to have this as the benign economic environment stretches back for more than 25 years.\n\nWhere a complete data set is not available, Fitch may use market-based default data as a proxy for the lender's defaults, subject to the agency being comfortable that the data is sufficiently comparable in terms of products, origination channels, borrower profiles, performance and underwriting criteria. In practice, finding proxy data for secured lending, particularly residential mortgages, has proven substantially easier than for SME loans or unsecured lending where origination strategies and underwriting models often lack similarities. The absence of a complete data set may lead to either a rating cap or Fitch deciding not to rate the transaction at all.\n\nFitch recently rated Pepper Asset Finance's auto finance and equipment transaction, Pepper SPARKZ Trust No. 1, which did not have a full data set available. In this case, Fitch was able to use proxy data to augment Pepper's own historical data to determine base-case default rates. In addition to performance data, other considerations may also be relevant such as the competitive environment, including regulations and barriers to entry, to evaluate whether a new lender can enter its chosen market without compromising credit quality and whether its customer base is comparable with that of the incumbent. Financial viability is also a consideration especially if the company is a start-up. Investment-grade rated securitisation transactions are characterised by: established lenders with employees who have significant experience in lending; well-developed processes and procedures; sophisticated collections and arrears management processes and systems; and operating platforms that have securitisation segregation and reporting functionality. In addition, Fitch expects the product classes to have a proven track record in the lending market.", "description": "Fitch Rtgs: Track Record Key for New Lenders in Australian Securitisations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE470C4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
