Per the deal, Ericsson will provide its industry-leading radio system for use across Xtreme Enterprises' network solution and service portfolio to deliver stable broadband speed and reliability of data usage.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Xtreme Enterprises \u2013 a Pennsylvania-based Internet connectivity services provider \u2013 has carved a niche market for providing network capabilities to WISPs. With Ericsson\u2019s state-of-the-art LTE equipment, it aims to facilitate the WISPs to extend coverage by reaching more customers with higher speeds. In particular, it will offer Ericsson's Micro Radio 2208, which delivers the highest allowable power output for outdoor deployments, for Citizens Broadband Radio Service.\n\n\n\nEricsson Micro Radio 2208 ensures robust, wide-area coverage and capacity. Notably, the radio system comprises hardware, software and services for radio, antenna system, transport, power, enclosure and site solutions. It provides the required infrastructure to support the burgeoning demand for high-bandwidth connections and supports real-time, high-reliability communication requirements of mission-critical applications.\n\n\n\nBuoyed by the strategic partnership, Ericsson aims to reach various underserved markets throughout the country and fill the void created by the trade restrictions on Huawei equipment. With the emergence of the smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased in recent times. Further, to maintain superior performance as traffic increases, there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization. Ericsson, being one of the premier telecom services providers, is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. Notably, Ericsson is the world\u2019s largest supplier of LTE technology with a huge market share. Also, it has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide.\n\n\n\nEricsson is actively pursuing three key areas \u2014 core business expansion, targeted growth, and cost and efficiency to fuel growth. The company maintains strong control of its cost position to stay competitive. AI and automation remain key enablers for its future business development. Ericsson remains confident of reaching its long-term target of at least 12% operating margin beyond 2020.\n\n\n\nDespite the inherent growth potential, Ericsson\u2019s shares have lost 4.6% against the industry\u2019s growth of 17.3% year to date. Favorable industry trends are likely to boost its long-term growth and profitability. The company intends to accelerate its planned cost cuts and efficiency measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nEricsson currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
