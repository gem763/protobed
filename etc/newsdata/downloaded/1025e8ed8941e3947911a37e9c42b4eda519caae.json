County: he's on the outside looking in. So, he's even walked away from his own organization on this,\" Homan said.\n\nWhile some argue that sanctuary policies are \"protecting\" the immigrant community, Homan said that criminal illegal immigrants are a threat to those communities.\n\n\"This sheriff is taking a political stance. He forgot the oath he's taken. He stopped being a cop, [he] became a politician, because he's not protecting these communities as much as he could,\" he told Kilmeade.\n\nSome members of Congress want to pass legislation to make cooperation with ICE mandatory -- with the threat of losing federal money for those agencies that refuse.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he is working on another solution. His bill would allow sanctuary cities to refuse cooperation, but would then make them liable for a civil lawsuit from anyone who was victimized by a migrant released under the sanctuary policy.\n\nHoman noted that while the Department of Justice is still fighting sanctuary state laws, \"all law enforcement across this country knows that this president...has their back.\"\n\n\"We've got the right guy. These people running for the Democratic nomination, every one of them, they want sanctuary cities, they want open borders, they want to abolish ICE...\" he concluded.", "description": "Voters need to make their voices heard if they want to repeal sanctuary city policies,\u00a0former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director and Fox News contributor Tom Homan said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/723222ea-HOMAN-CROP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
