KiK claims Kin is not a security, but if the SEC\u2019s allegations that Kin is a security are deemed true, then the sale was a violation of securities laws.\n\n\u201cAfter 18 months of working with the SEC the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court,\u201d Livingston wrote, framing the company\u2019s decision as a \u201cfight\u201d for the future of cryptocurrencies. \u201cBecoming a security would kill the usability of any cryptocurrency and set a dangerous precedent for the industry.\u201d\n\nIn the post, Livingston said he will reduce the staff to 19, which would reportedly affect more than 100 employees. He wrote that moving forward his company will focus on its cryptocurrency Kin, which is at the centre of the SEC lawsuit.\n\n\u201cInstead of selling some of our Kin into the limited liquidity that exists today, we made the decision to focus our current resources on the few things that matter most,\u201d Livingston wrote, apparently referring to his cryptocurrency plans, adding that \u201cwe need to become the first project that creates real demand by getting people to buy Kin to use it.\u201d\n\nLivingston asserts that these changes will lower Kik Interactive\u2019s burn rate by 85 per cent, allowing the company to survive the trial.\n\nKik Interactive did not immediately respond to a Gizmodo request for comment on when the company will shut down Kik.\n\nCryptocurrency news site CoinDesk added to the company\u2019s headaches when it published an inaccurate story late Tuesday falsely claiming that Livingston sent the reporter a message saying he had been drinking and wanted to quit because \u201cI\u2019m not going to jail for this.\u201d\n\nLivingston immediately tweeted that the report was false and CoinDesk retracted the story.\n\nI just landed in Washington. I took off from Tel Aviv 12 hours ago. This is obviously fabricated. I\u2019m not sure how Coindesk could make such an obvious mistake, but we\u2019ll find out https://t.co/SjL9wMVGkp \u2014 Ted Livingston (@ted_livingston) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cCoinDesk has become the apparent victim of a Telegram hoax, in which an unknown individual sought to spread misinformation by posing as Ted Livingston, CEO of messaging startup Kik,\u201d the retraction states.\n\nThank you for taking responsibility. This article has done a lot of damage, and will live on despite the correction for years to come. Will you commit to sharing the findings of your evaluation with the community, and what responsibility the author will be taking? https://t.co/vLe7FDjQL9 \u2014 Ted Livingston (@ted_livingston) September 24, 2019\n\nLivingston tweeted that the \u201carticle has done a lot of damage.\u201d The immediate hiccup does not bode well for the company as it continues its \u201cfight.\u201d", "description": "Kik Interactive plans to shut down its popular messaging app following a legal battle with the Security Exchange Commission, and will instead focus on its cryptocurrency Kin, which is at the centre of the lawsuit....", "authors": ["Robb Holland", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/hj00e2amgey7mecy2ajr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
