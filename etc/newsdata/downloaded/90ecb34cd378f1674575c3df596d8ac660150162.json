The allegation is that the president withheld military aid from Ukraine and used it in an effort to get dirt on the Bidens. The whistleblower also claims that the administration went to great lengths to \"bury\" a controversial phone call on July 25 between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Selensky.\n\nTrump denies any wrongdoing and said he was just making sure that the country -- which is known for corruption -- was getting off on the right foot with its new president.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" reported Sunday that it received a letter that indicated that the government whistleblower has been put under federal protection due to safety concerns.\n\nThe report had a PDF of the Sept. 28 letter from the Compass Rose Legal Group, to the officer of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nWHO IS JOSEPH MAGUIRE?\n\nThe letter said, in part, \"The purpose of this letter is to formally notify you of serious concerns we have regarding our client\u2019s personal safety. We appreciate your office\u2019s support thus far to activate appropriate resources to ensure their safety.\"\n\nThe letter did not specify the \"support\" or \"resources\" that were offered.\n\nThe news program later tweeted that it stood by its \"sources and reporting on the whistleblower.\"\n\nZaid asked if the program's response meant that it has a source other than the letter sent by the legal team.\n\n\"Because if it doesn\u2019t, and I know it doesn\u2019t, then it is literally making stuff up. That helps no one, especially the #whistleblower,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe letter stressed the urgency in protecting the whistleblower's identity and claimed that there's a $50,000 bounty for information about the client. The letter was signed by Andrew P. Bakaj, the lead attorney in the case.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" did not immediately respond to an early morning email from Fox News.\n\nOne social media user highlighted the sentence in his legal group\u2019s letter that expressed gratitude to Maguire\u2019s office for activating the \u201cappropriate resources to ensure\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s safety and asked what was misinterpreted.\n\nAn email to Zaid was not immediately returned.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nZaid said talks are still ongoing and we \u201ccontinue to work w/both parties in House & Senate & we understand all agree protecting whistleblower\u2019s identity is paramount.\u201d He said no time or date has been set.", "description": "A lawyer representing the unidentified whistleblower in Congress' impeachment investigation was critical of \"60 Minutes\" after the Sunday broadcast and said the program \"misinterpreted\"\u00a0a letter from\u00a0his legal team that they reported indicated that his client is under federal protection.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
