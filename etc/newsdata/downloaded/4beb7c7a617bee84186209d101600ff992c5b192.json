A new national survey from Grinnell College, conducted by the respected Iowa pollster Ann Selzer, probes public attitudes in more plain language \u2013 and gets revealing results.\n\n\u201cIs it okay with you or not okay for political candidates in the U.S. to ask for assistance from a foreign government to help them win an election?\u201d In response to that question, only 7 percent of U.S. adults say it\u2019s okay. Eighty-one percent say it is not okay.\n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll earlier this month asked whether it was appropriate for Trump to request that Ukraine investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. When the names Trump and Biden were included in the question, 32 percent of U.S. adults said it was okay and 62 percent said it was not. Predictably, in this era of tribalism, there was a stark partisan divide: 59 percent of Republicans said Trump\u2019s request was appropriate, while 84 percent of Democrats said it was inappropriate.\n\nThe Grinnell poll, conducted Oct. 17-23, surveyed 1,003 adults. Its margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The numbers of people who say it\u2019s wrong to seek assistance from a foreign government are remarkably consistent across ages, demographic groups, education levels, income and even party lines. More than 80 percent of self-identified Republicans, evangelicals and rural dwellers say it\u2019s not okay for a president to ask for assistance from a foreign government to help win an election.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to foreign interference, having findings this close to a consensus are rare in polling these days,\u201d said Selzer, who also conducts the gold-standard Iowa poll for the Des Moines Register. \u201cThe substance of the question at hand in the impeachment inquiry does not seem in dispute. What\u2019s appropriate in terms of process and consequences is far less clear.\u201d\n\nThis helps explain why Trump defenders on Capitol Hill have fixated more on complaining about the impeachment process than offering a substantive defense of Trump\u2019s conduct toward Ukraine or his public call for China, from the White House lawn, to investigate the Bidens. The rough transcript of the July 25 call released by Trump shows the president asking explicitly for a \u201cfavor\u201d right after Zelensky raised the subject of military aid to Ukraine. Additional reporting, along with sworn testimony from administration officials, has established that this was part of a broader campaign to compel Kyiv to help Trump tar Democrats generally and Biden specifically. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney even acknowledged in the briefing room that military aid to Ukraine was being held up to secure a politically advantageous investigation, though he later sought to walk it back.\n\n-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that the House will take its first vote related to the impeachment inquiry this Thursday, dictating the rules for the next phase of the investigation. Her goal is to undermine what has been a central Republican line of attack and to create additional legal cover for ongoing court fights aimed at breaking through the administration\u2019s stated policy of stonewalling. Pelosi said the resolution that the House votes on will lay out which hearings would be open and how the transcripts from witnesses who have testified in closed sessions would be released. It will also grant due process to the president and his attorney.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,\u201d the speaker said in a Monday letter to her Democratic colleagues.\n\nThe Grinnell poll finds that 42 percent of Americans believe that Trump should be impeached and removed from office while 44 percent say he should not. On a separate question, 48 percent agree with the House\u2019s decision to open an impeachment inquiry while 42 percent disagree. \u201cWhile nearly all Republicans believe that asking for foreign help to win an election is the wrong thing to do, in this case, most don\u2019t believe it rises to the level of an impeachable offense,\u201d said Grinnell political scientist Peter Hanson, who directs the school\u2019s polling project.\n\n-- White House officials, who have justified noncompliance with the investigation by pointing to the lack of a formal vote, suggested that their approach won\u2019t change even after Pelosi does what they\u2019ve been demanding. Republican allies on the Hill coordinated their messaging and cited the planned vote as proof that the process was flawed. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew \u2014 that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the president due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\n-- A separate poll from USA Today and Suffolk University, also released this morning, shows that most Americans want Trump to cooperate with the investigation. Asked if the White House had an obligation to comply with subpoenas from the House committees demanding testimony and documents, 66 percent of those surveyed said yes and only 26 percent said no. Those who think the White House should comply with congressional subpoenas include 35 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe poll included the names of the relevant politicians and thus found more predictable partisan breakdowns on questions related to underlying conduct. To wit: Nearly four in 10 said Trump\u2019s phone call pressuring Zelensky to meddle in U.S. politics is itself an impeachable offense, but three in 10 said there was nothing wrong with the conversation. The poll found that 46 percent of Americans support Congress voting to impeach and remove Trump from office. On the other end, 37 percent said the House should stop investigating the president and his administration altogether.\n\n\u201cLast week, even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of distancing himself from a tweet by Trump that likened his impeachment to \u2018a lynching.\u2019 In the poll, though, 40% say they agree with the racially charged tweet; 54% disagree,\u201d Susan Page, Savannah Behrmann and Jeanine Santucci report in USA Today. \u201cTrump\u2019s strongest support comes from those who say Fox News is the TV network they trusted most; 78% of Fox viewers say they agree that Trump\u2019s impeachment was like a \u2018lynching.\u2019 In contrast, just 2% of those who trust MSNBC most and 10% of those who trust CNN most agree with the statement. \u2026 The telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Oct. 23-26, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\u201d\n\nU.S. Army Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, arrives on Tuesday for a closed session before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees at the Capitol. (Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Rex)\n\n-- Bad facts continue to emerge for the president: An Army officer who is assigned to the White House plans to tell House investigators today that he was disturbed by Trump\u2019s demand that Ukraine investigate his political rivals. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, is the first person to testify who was actually on the line for Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky. His prepared testimony returns repeatedly to his fears that Trump\u2019s manipulation of Ukraine policy to discredit Biden is unethical and damaging to U.S. national security. His six-page prepared statement bolsters previous testimony by Fiona Hill, his former boss at the NSC, and Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cVindman states that Trump\u2019s initial call with the new Ukrainian president, made after Zelensky\u2019s April election, was positive. \u2026 But within weeks of that initial promise, he grew worried that the policy was being hijacked by partisan politics,\u201d Greg Jaffe reports. \u201cVindman cites a July 10 meeting in which Gordon Sondland, a major Trump donor and ambassador to the European Union, emphasized that to secure a meeting with Trump, the Ukrainians would have to \u2018deliver investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\u2019 a Ukrainian natural gas company that had controversially tapped Biden\u2019s son to serve on its board. \u2026 Following the briefing, Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council\u2019s top lawyer. Vindman\u2019s statement notes that an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma would likely inject Ukraine\u2019s new president into U.S. politics and cause the struggling democracy to lose bipartisan support in Congress. \u2018This would undermine U.S. national security,\u2019 Vindman writes.\n\n\u201cVindman\u2019s most direct contact with Trump came in the form of preparing documents for the president to sign regarding Ukraine. At the direction of his superiors at the NSC, including John Bolton, then the national security adviser, Vindman drafted a memorandum in mid-August that sought to restart $391 million in security aid that was being withheld from Ukraine \u2026 But Trump refused to sign it. He also drafted a letter in May congratulating Zelensky on his inauguration that Trump declined to sign.\u201d (The New York Times has additional details on the memo and the letter.)\n\nVindman\u2019s family fled the Soviet Union when he was 3. He describes himself as a patriot and proud immigrant. The lieutenant colonel was assigned to the White House in July 2018 after a tour in the Pentagon, where he helped prepare the U.S. military\u2019s principal strategy for managing competition with Russia. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman writes in his opening statement. \u201cIt is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics \u2026 A strong and independent Ukraine is critical to U.S. national security interests because Ukraine is a front-line state and bulwark against Russian aggression.\u201d (Read the full statement here.)\n\n-- \u201cIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said the House resolution would establish that his committee will conduct the open hearings, further solidifying his role as the Democrats\u2019 point person,\u201d John Hudson, Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis report. \u201cRepublicans have complained the probe should be led by the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over the State Department. The resolution also would ensure that any evidence or a report would be provided to the Judiciary Committee, which would vote on articles of impeachment before sending them to the full House. \u2026\n\n\u201cWord of the vote came as the investigation hit a new roadblock, with former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman failing to show for his deposition Monday. Kupperman had asked a federal judge to referee a constitutional dispute between the House and the Trump administration over whether he should testify. Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit threatened to slow down the probe and could affect the House\u2019s ability to secure testimony from [Bolton], who has retained the same lawyer as Kupperman.\n\n\u201cBut instead of waiting for courts to resolve the standoff, Democrats are pivoting to a new strategy and seeking to bring in lower-ranking government officials they hope can corroborate previous testimony alleging a quid pro quo. In recent days, they have fired off new letters requesting testimony from Robert Blair, a senior adviser to [Mulvaney]; two officials with experience at the Energy Department, Brian McCormack and Wells Griffith; and two State Department officials familiar with Ukraine policy, Catherine Croft and Chris Anderson \u2026 In a major victory for Democrats, an attorney for the White House\u2019s senior director for Europe and Russia, Tim Morrison, said Monday that her client would testify if summoned by House investigators.\u201d\n\n-- A federal judge has scheduled a hearing for 3 p.m. on Thursday in the Kupperman case. Judge Richard Leon worked as both a congressional committee investigator and a Justice Department attorney before George W. Bush nominated him for the U.S. District Court in 2001, so he ostensibly understands the perspective of both parties. He pledged to move expeditiously because of \u201cthe time-sensitive nature of the issues raised in this case.\u201d\n\n-- Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) said on Monday that they will join Mitt Romney in not co-sponsoring a resolution spearheaded by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to condemn the House\u2019s impeachment process.\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers. Polling director Scott Clement helped with the Big Idea.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nA satellite view of the residence of ISIS commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. (Maxar Technologies/Reuters)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- \u201cWhen U.S. forces found Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State militant group, he was not in some forgotten border town or remote patch of desert but in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, a place where Baghdadi surely knew he was surrounded by enemies, and eyes,\u201d Kareem Fahim and Sarah Dadouch report from the region. \u201cThe province, a major battlefield in Syria\u2019s civil war, is dominated by an Islamist militant movement hostile to the Islamic State. In the skies, Syrian and Russian warplanes are ever-present, carrying out bombing raids to help the government of President Bashar al-Assad recapture Idlib, Syria\u2019s last rebel-held bastion. Observation posts manned by Turkish soldiers dot the province. Three million people live or shelter there, in a place only slightly larger than Delaware and nearly impossible to escape.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear how long Baghdadi had been in Idlib or what he was doing there. But the province where he died \u2014 with its refugee camps, its front lines, its unshakable sense of dread \u2014 stands as a stark reminder of the misery and threats still radiating from Syria\u2019s civil war. Western intelligence agencies are nervously monitoring the fighting in Idlib, which has become a proving ground for a new generation of extremists, in a war that has already bred thousands of hardened militants. Since late April, the Syrian government\u2019s offensive to retake the rebel-held territory has killed or injured more than a thousand civilians, according to the United Nations and human rights groups. More than 500,000 have fled the fighting in southern Idlib and neighboring Hama province. Syrian and Russian warplanes have bombed hospitals and schools. ...\n\n\"The Islamic State has a low-key presence in Idlib as well, with its fighters forming \u2018sleeper cells\u2019 in the province ... There was no obvious reason Baghdadi would have felt safe in Idlib ... The Islamic State had been targeted in raids carried out by HTS and was seen as an adversary by other militant groups, including Hurras al-Din.\u201d\n\n-- Pentagon officials indicated that more operations targeting ISIS are possible now that Baghdadi is gone. Dan Lamothe and Karen DeYoung report: \u201cOfficials said two men were captured during the weekend raid who could provide intelligence about the group. Baghdadi\u2019s remains, which were tested to confirm his identity, were buried at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Muslim custom ... The new details emerged as Trump administration officials sought to place the operation in the context of an overall strategy to bring peace to Syria while ending the terrorism threat in the region.\"\n\n-- U.S. government officials are worried Trump has shared too many sensitive details of the Baghdadi raid. From NBC News: \u201cA robot had been on standby to aid in the hunt for al-Baghdadi if needed. U.S. Special Operations Forces arrived in eight helicopters and were on the ground for about two hours. They entered al-Baghdadi's compound within seconds by blowing holes in the side of the wall. They chased al-Baghdadi into a web of underground tunnels \u2014 many of them dead ends \u2014 that they already knew existed. Before the U.S. forces left for the 70-minute, \u2018very low and very, very fast\u2019 helicopter ride back along the same route from which they arrived, they captured some of al-Baghdadi's henchmen and seized \u2018highly sensitive material and information\u2019 outlining the origin of ISIS and plans for future plots. A few of those colorful details were wrong. Many of the rest were either highly classified or tactically sensitive, and their disclosure by the president made intelligence and military officials cringe, according to current and former U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cThe al-Baghdadi raid is the most high-profile exhibit of a reality U.S. officials have had to contend with since Trump took office: a president with a background in show business who relishes delivering a compelling narrative and deals daily with the kind of covert, life-and-death sets of facts that inspire movie scripts. \u2026 Current and former senior U.S. officials said from the earliest days of his presidency that Trump consistently wants to make public more than his advisers think is legally sound or wise for U.S national security. \u2018We agonized over what we would put in his briefings,\u2019 one former senior White House official said, \u2018because who knows if and when he's going to say something about it.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump has also fed intrigue about a classified military dog that was injured in the Baghdadi raid by posting a picture of the animal on Twitter. The raid was carried out by elite members of Delta Force and the Army\u2019s 75th Ranger Regiment, per Lamothe: \u201cThe Pentagon kept most details about the covert canine, including its name and background, on a tight leash. \u2026 Three U.S. officials \u2026 said Monday that the dog\u2019s identity was classified because of its affiliation with a classified unit. Releasing the name, they said, ran the risk of identifying the service members to which it was assigned.\u201d\n\nPentagon sources tell us that the dog is a male Belgian Malinois, a common breed in Special Operations that is prized for its intelligence, athleticism and ferocity \u2013 when required: \u201cThe dog\u2019s participation in the operation adds a new hero to military lore. It follows in the paw prints of Cairo, who participated in the 2011 raid by Navy SEALs that killed Osama bin Laden, but dogs have served in the military for decades. While the dog in the latest raid was wounded, it will not be eligible for a Purple Heart or valor medal. The U.S. military once recognized canines for such exceptional service but suspended the practice amid complaints that it diminished the service of humans, according to an Army history of military dogs. Other countries, such as Britain, still award dogs for valor.\u201d\n\n-- Trump said the U.S. will be \u201ckeeping the oil\u201d in northeastern Syria, a move considered a war crime by some. From ABC News: \u201cTrump has a long history of calling for the U.S. to \u2018take the oil\u2019 in the Middle East, in Iraq and Syria in particular. But any oil in both countries belongs to their governments, and according to U.S. law and treaties it has ratified, seizing it would be pillaging, a technical term for theft during wartime that is illegal under U.S. and international law. \u2018We're keeping the oil,\u2019 Trump said Monday to a conference of police chiefs in Chicago. \u2018I've always said that -- keep the oil. We want to keep the oil, $45 million a month. Keep the oil. We've secured the oil.\u2019 \u2026 Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed Monday that U.S. troops will remain in the eastern Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor \u2018to secure the oil fields\u2019 against ISIS. But the senior State Department official said the administration was \u2018just beginning to look at the specifics of this,\u2019 and downplayed a U.S. role in seizing any oil.\u201d\n\n-- There's a bear in the woods: Russia has been quietly building a low-profile infrastructure of political influence across Africa to challenge American power. From the Times: \u201cDeploying its international propaganda arms, the television channel RT and the Sputnik news agency, the Kremlin is honing this message: While Western Europe and the United States are continuing a centuries-old tradition of exploiting Africa, Moscow is ready to engage with Africa on mutually beneficial terms. Russia is also benefiting from a desire by African countries to lessen their reliance on China, even as Moscow acknowledges that it cannot come close to matching Beijing\u2019s financial firepower. \u2026\n\n\"Moscow has already injected itself into the geopolitics of Libya and the Central African Republic. Now it is looking for inroads in public opinion and the political elite across the continent. \u2026 Perhaps the most prominent figure in Russia\u2019s Africa push is Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the St. Petersburg businessman indicted by the United States for running the online \u2018troll farm\u2019 that sought to sway the 2016 American presidential election, who is said to run a military contractor called Wagner that is involved in several African countries. Another is Konstantin Malofeev, a nationalist banker under American sanctions who has cultivated ties with far-right politicians in Europe and the United States, as well as pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\u201d\n\n-- A cyberattack affected 2,000 offices in the country of Georgia, including those of the president. Will Englund reports: \u201cAccording to local news sites, it was the largest cyberattack in the country since 2008, when Russians are suspected to have launched an assault as the two nations were briefly going to war with each other. Analysts said that Monday\u2019s action was not very sophisticated but that it shows the weakness of Georgia\u2019s cybersecurity.\u201d\n\n-- Lebanon\u2019s Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced he will resign from his post. Following nearly two weeks of countrywide protests over high prices, unemployment and poor services, Lebanon\u2019s prime minister announced his resignation in a televised address. Over 10 days of protest, the dissolving of the government has been a key demand. (Developing.)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- One day after announcing her resignation from Congress, Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) said she will become an advocate for victims of \u201crevenge porn.\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \u201cIn a message Monday to supporters, she apologized for her \u2018imperfections\u2019 and promised to \u2018fight to ensure that no one else has to live through what I just experienced\u2019 in connection with the release of the intimate photos. \u2018Some people call this electronic assault, digital exploitation. Others call it revenge porn. As a victim of it, I call it one of the worst things we can do to our sisters and our daughters,\u2019 Hill said in the video. \u2026 In her resignation announcement Sunday, Hill said she was considering legal options over the photos and that \u2018as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The conservative blogger who published a nude picture of the 32-year-old congresswoman is now promoting Republican candidates for the special election to fill her seat. From Politico: \u201c\u2018If you want to help us flip @KatieHill4CA's former #CA25 seat BACK to RED, please learn more about [Republican Mike Garcia] and contribute to his campaign\u2026' tweeted Jennifer Van Laar, a deputy managing editor at RedState. Later, Van Laar suggested that she\u2019d back former Congressman Steve Knight if he decided to run for the seat he lost to Hill in 2018. \u2026 Van Laar\u2019s views, like RedState\u2019s leanings, are no secret: She\u2019s worked in Republican politics and the site is conservative, as is its owner, Salem Media Group. But Van Laar\u2019s shift from reporting on Hill, and publishing what some have deemed \u2018revenge porn,\u2019 to promoting Republicans for Hill\u2019s old job is a blurring of roles that would be unacceptable in mainstream newsrooms.\u201d\n\n-- The top Republican on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee will not seek reelection next year \u2014 another sign that GOP lawmakers are pessimistic about retaking the House majority in 2020. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) served as chairman of the powerful panel for the first two years of the Trump presidency. \"Walden is the 22nd House Republican to retire, resign or seek another office since the 116th Congress convened in January. Seven Democrats have retired or resigned in that time,\" Mike DeBonis reports. \"Walden, 62, could have served as the committee\u2019s top Republican through 2022 under party rules, but is opting instead to relinquish a chance to again wield one of Capitol Hill\u2019s most powerful gavels \u2026 Walden has shown occasional discomfort with some of President Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 voting with Democrats this year to cancel Trump\u2019s border emergency declaration and to end the government shutdown that stretched into January \u2014 but he has strongly defended Trump amid the pending impeachment probe. His eastern Oregon district is heavily Republican, voting for Trump by 19 points in 2016.\u201d\n\n-- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) scheduled the special election for April to replace the late Elijah Cummings. Democrats are expected to easily hold the seat. (Erin Cox)\n\n-- Former attorney general Jeff Sessions of Alabama is weighing a bid for his old U.S. Senate seat, meeting with consultants, retired senators and allies in recent weeks to plot out a potential 2020 campaign. This would likely infuriate Trump, who attacked Sessions dozens of times for recusing himself from Bob Mueller\u2019s Russia probe and occasionally still complains about the former attorney general. \u201cSessions, 72, has joked in recent weeks that he was glad he was not shot by the president, and he has continued to give public and private remarks supporting him,\u201d Josh Dawsey and Felicia Sonmez report. \u201cHe has not taken any public positions since being fired from the administration. The move was first reported by Politico. A close Sessions ally said the former attorney general had not yet made a final decision....\n\n\u201cIf he runs, Sessions would be joining a crowded field of Republicans seeking to face Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) \u2026 Among the Republicans who have already announced is Roy Moore, the party\u2019s failed 2017 candidate. Other Republicans who have already joined the race are former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and state Rep. Arnold Mooney.\u201d\n\n-- North Carolina\u2019s 2020 congressional elections must happen under new maps, a state court ruled last night, in a win for Democrats with implications for who controls the House. From the News & Observer: \u201cThe legislature must now redraw the state\u2019s 13 U.S. House districts. The judge \u2014 two Democrats and one Republican from different parts of North Carolina \u2014 wrote that the maps show signs of \u2018extreme partisan gerrymandering\u2019 which \u2018is contrary to the fundamental right of North Carolina citizens to have elections conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the people.\u2019 Monday\u2019s ruling, a preliminary injunction, said the state may not hold any elections for Congress using the current maps passed in 2016. Those maps replaced a different set of maps from 2011, also drawn by the Republican-led legislature, which were struck down as unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. The judges ruled that if there aren\u2019t new maps in time for the primary elections on March 3 then they could delay all or some of the primaries until later in 2020.\u201d\n\n-- Georgia is planning to purge about 300,000 voters from its rolls because they haven't voted in several years. From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: \u201cThe purge comes after Georgia canceled 534,119 registrations in July 2017, the largest single removal of voters in U.S. history. Under a new state law, election officials will notify voters before canceling their registrations, a step that didn\u2019t exist two years ago. The voter list cleanup, announced Monday by the secretary of state\u2019s office, reinforces Georgia\u2019s role as a voting rights and political battleground ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\n-- During a conversation about Israel policy, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) broached an issue he rarely mentions while campaigning: his identity. Sean Sullivan and David Weigel report: \u201cThe senator from Vermont spoke of relatives killed in the Holocaust and centuries of suffering before concluding that \u2018if there is any people on earth who should do everything humanly possible\u2019 to combat Trump\u2019s divisiveness, \u2018it is the Jewish people.\u2019 The comments, at a conference in Washington hosted by the liberal Jewish organization J Street, were Sanders\u2019s most direct attempt yet to fuse his heritage to his political approach and policy agenda. His participation also served as a stark reminder of the distinctive space he occupies in the Democratic field. Sanders is the only prominent Jewish candidate, a vocal critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch Palestinian defender and the preferred candidate of the nation\u2019s first two Muslim congresswomen.\u201d\n\n-- While Trump and his allies have embraced the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants in campaign rallies, the seemingly spontaneous outburst of \u201cLock him up!\u201d chants during Game 5 of the World Series ignited a debate among Democrats: Should they give Trump a taste of his own medicine, or should they stick to the high road? Annie Linskey reports: \u201cOne side of the debate \u2014 as represented Monday by figures like Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a surrogate for the campaign of former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 argues that such coarse chants are inappropriate for a democracy, and that talk of jailing political opponents is the stuff of authoritarian regimes. \u2026 Other Democrats argue that Trump, a president they see as morally unfit for office and worthy of impeachment and removal, does not deserve the esteem that would be reserved for any other occupant of the White House. \u2026 Calls to the Democratic campaigns suggest the candidates are not inclined to embrace chants like the one Sunday night, though several chose not to address the issue. \u2026 The debate among Democrats over \u2018Lock him up\u2019 reflect a concern in some parts of the party that Trump has changed the nature of politics and it would be foolish to play by rules that no longer apply.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cAndrew Yang was groomed for a high-paying job at an elite law firm. He lasted five months,\u201d Kevin Sullivan writes in a profile: Yang\u2019s \u201cmarquee policy \u2014 giving every U.S. adult $1,000 a month in guaranteed income \u2014 is the most un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox proposal of any major candidate. It\u2019s the product of a nontraditional career, which began with his decision, in early 2000, to quit his law firm and walk away from all that money, prestige and comfort. He frequently refers to his lawyer days as \u2018the five worst months of my life.\u2019 \u2018Working at a law firm was like a pie-eating contest, and if you won, your prize was more pie,\u2019 Yang said in a recent interview on the Acela train from Washington to New York, between hurried bites of a turkey sandwich. The law jokes play well, especially because seven of the 12 candidates in the last televised Democratic debate have law degrees. But quitting law was not really about walking away from something. It was more about running toward something else that was calling to him with a sudden, urgent clarity.\u201d\n\n-- A new trend in the 2020 race: Donating to candidates you won\u2019t vote for, just to keep their voices on the trail. From Medium\u2019s Gen: \u201cJuli\u00e1n Castro has a plea to voters: Help him raise $800,000 by October 31, or he will be forced to drop out of the Democratic presidential primary. \u2026 His plea elicited a rush of small donations \u2014 including some from people who say they have no interest in voting for him. \u2018My preferred candidate is Cory Booker,\u2019 says Lee Jolliffe, a journalism professor at Drake University in Iowa who says she\u2019s donated around $40 to the Castro campaign. \u2026 \u2018But I want Juli\u00e1n in the race, I want his voice on the stage for the debate. It\u2019s wildly important to hear a voice that represents 20% of our population.\u2019 Castro is the only Latino in the race and one just six candidates of color running for president.\u201d\n\nPeople take part in a rally for DACA and TPS recipients in New York. (Johannes Eisele/AFP)\n\nTHE NON-IMPEACHMENT AGENDA THAT SHOULDN'T BE OVERSHADOWED:\n\n-- The Trump administration said it will extend the temporary work permits of 200,000 Salvadorans living in the U.S., reversing course on Trump\u2019s vow to deport them. Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti report: \u201cU.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Ronald Johnson and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said that the United States is extending El Salvador\u2019s temporary protected status, a provisional residency granted to thousands of Salvadorans after the country was ravaged by an earthquake in 2001. The status had been renewed on an 18-month basis since, until the Trump administration announced its termination in 2018, saying TPS was no longer warranted for nationals of El Salvador, Haiti, Sudan and Nicaragua. \u2026 In a statement, DHS said it arrived at its revised decision on TPS for Salvadorans after considering the possible consequences of mass deportations. \u2026\n\n\u201cKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, disputed the U.S. ambassador\u2019s description of the arrangement as a TPS extension. \u2026 DHS framed the TPS decision as part of a larger collaborative security package the United States and El Salvador signed Monday in Washington. \u2026 The U.S. government typically provides public justification for TPS extensions by explaining the conditions within a country that make it too dangerous for nationals to return, but the Trump administration offered no such explanation Monday. The Trump administration in September signed a separate deal with El Salvador that allows the U.S. government to divert asylum seekers from the southern border to El Salvador as part of a broader strategy to discourage would-be immigrants from seeking refuge in the United States. \u2026 Immigrant rights advocates celebrated the reprieve from deportation but criticized what they saw as the administration\u2019s leveraging the safety of hundreds of thousands of immigrants as part of a \u2018trade\u2019 to keep new asylum seekers out of the United States.\u201d\n\n-- Case in point: The Trump administration will begin sending Honduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers to Guatemala as soon as this week. Nick Miroff reports: \u201cThe Trump administration is preparing to finalize an agreement this week to begin sending asylum seekers from the U.S. border to Guatemala, implementing a deal the two countries reached in July, according to three people with knowledge of the plan. \u2026 Guatemala\u2019s highest court initially ruled that the asylum accord could not go forward without the approval of Guatemala\u2019s congress, but a subsequent decision left open the possibility that outgoing President Jimmy Morales could implement the deal without lawmakers\u2019 approval. \u2026 Kevin McAleenan, who plans to step down as acting DHS secretary as soon as Thursday, has secured similar agreements with Honduras and El Salvador, but those deals have not been implemented ... Trump suspended aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador this spring [and] announced that he would restore some of the assistance this month after the three countries agreed to accept U.S. asylum seekers.\u201d\n\n-- A new report by the Government Accountability Office finds mixed results for 370 projects funded by Americans to battle poverty and misgovernance in the three Northern Triangle countries. The projects cost $2.4 billion between 2013 and 2018. The GAO reviewed 190 of the projects and found that agencies provided uneven evaluations of their projects and collected inconsistent data needed to evaluate progress. In its report, the GAO recommended that the Department of State collaborate with the Departments of Defense and Agriculture to develop a more comprehensive approach to monitoring and evaluating these projects.\n\n-- Google hired Miles Taylor, who served as a top aide to then-DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Facing a massive backlash from rank-and-file employees, company executives falsely claimed that he was not involved in Trump\u2019s family separation policy, according to BuzzFeed News: \u201cAs Nielsen\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Taylor was included on some of the DHS secretary\u2019s emails and privy to her events schedule, often prepping his boss with reports and talking points ahead of public appearances between April and June 2018, when the family separation policy was in effect. In one email ... Taylor assisted Nielsen in preparing what he described as the \u2018Protecting Children Narrative\u2019 \u2014 the department\u2019s spin on a policy that horrified Americans when images of abandoned, caged migrant children in squalid camps emerged. Other emails from Nielsen\u2019s events planner show that he had been scheduled to participate in at least two weekly calls to \u2018discuss Border Security and Immigration Enforcement\u2019 in June 2018. Two former DHS officials dismissed Google\u2019s claim that Taylor \u2014 who last month joined the company as a government affairs and public policy manager advising on national security issues \u2014 could have kept his hands clean from the policy.\"\n\n-- In related news: More than 250 Facebook employees have signed onto a letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg that decries their company's decision to allow politicians to make false claims in ads. From the Times: \u201cFor the past two weeks, the text of the letter has been publicly visible on Facebook Workplace, a software program that the Silicon Valley company uses to communicate internally. ... While the number of signatures on the letter was a fraction of Facebook\u2019s 35,000-plus work force, it was one sign of the resistance that the company is now facing internally over how it treats political ads. Many employees have been discussing Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to let politicians post anything they want in Facebook ads because those ads can go viral and spread misinformation widely. The worker dissatisfaction has spilled out across winding, heated threads on Facebook Workplace.\"\n\n-- A San Francisco man registered as a candidate in California\u2019s 2022 gubernatorial election just so he can run false Facebook ads of his own.

(WSJ)\n\n-- As fires continue raging, Californians are refining an important skill: Evacuating. Heather Kelly, Scott Wilson and Joy Lanzendorfer report: \u201cMemories of the fires in Sonoma County a mere two years ago \u2014 which claimed 22 lives \u2014 are still fresh here in this area which saw an exodus of 200,000 residents over the weekend. In interviews, businesses, families and others expressed a remarkably similar sentiment: this time, the evacuation went much smoother. \u2026 It is too early to tell whether the current blazes will be as deadly as two years ago. But some authorities attribute the lack of deaths to the way Californians are adapting. As if to punctuate this new normal, authorities said Monday that the fires in Northern California, which are burning more than 66,000 acres, may not be contained until Nov. 7, according to officials. And PG&E has said its rolling power outages to prevent fires may continue happening for a decade. Fires also burned in Southern California on Monday, forcing the evacuation of 10,000 people and destroying several homes.\u201d\n\n-- Hurricane-force winds have been fanning the blazes across the state, raising fears that this seemingly annual onslaught of fires is the new normal. Jason Samenow and Andrew Freedman report: \u201cIn Northern California, this year\u2019s windstorms have shocked forecasters for happening so closely packed together. After being bombarded by a windstorm on Wednesday and Thursday last week, and a stronger \u2018historic\u2019 blast this weekend, the area is bracing for a third surge Tuesday and Wednesday. \u2018I\u2019ve been in this business for 28 years. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u2019 said Steve Anderson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s forecast office serving the San Francisco Bay area. Meanwhile, Southern California is bracing for its second dangerous wind storm in three days on Wednesday.\u201d\n\n-- A coalition of international automakers, including General Motors, Toyota and Chrysler, announced an effort to intervene on the side of the Trump administration in its ongoing fight with California over fuel standards. Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin report: \u201cThe move could pit the powerful auto manufacturers against other industry giants such as Ford, Honda and Volkswagen, which this summer struck a deal with California regulators to produce more fuel-efficient cars and trucks through 2025. It underscores carmarkers\u2019 desire to achieve some sort of regulatory certainty, at a time when the Trump administration and the nation\u2019s most populous state remain at a standoff.\u201d\n\n-- Boeing\u2019s CEO Dennis Muilenburg plans to acknowledge that his company made mistakes with the 737 Max Jet that led to a pair of deadly crashes. Ian Duncan has a sneak peek at his upcoming congressional testimony: \"We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong,\" Muilenburg plans to say. \"We own that, and we are fixing them.\"\n\n-- U.S. stock indexes reached record highs as the busiest week of the earnings season kicked off. Thomas Heath reports: \u201cThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index closed at 3,039, up almost 0.5 percent, eclipsing the broad market\u2019s previous high of 3,025 from July 26. The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite index were close behind, sending stocks upward in what is historically a bumpy month for markets.\"\n\n-- The president of the AFGE, the largest union representing federal workers, is taking a leave of absence as the union investigates sexual harassment claims made against him. Eli Rosenberg reports: \u201cJ. David Cox Sr., who has led the American Federation of Government Employees since since 2012, disclosed the investigation against him as well as his decision to take a leave of absence in a letter to a union\u2019s leadership council. \u2026 The allegations against Cox were outlined in a report by Bloomberg Businessweek. Ten men and women told the news outlet that they either witnesses or experienced inappropriate conduct by Cox on the job. One man, one of Cox\u2019s subordinates, described Cox telling him that he loved him repeatedly and at one point licking his ear.\u201d\n\n-- Jarrod Ramos admitted that he killed five people in the Annapolis newsroom of the Capital Gazette newspaper. Now a jury must decide whether Ramos was so mentally ill at the time that he should not be held legally culpable. Lynh Bui, Erin Cox and Paul Duggan report: \u201cIn court Monday, as survivors of the shooting and loved ones of the dead looked on, Ramos appeared before the judge, clad in green jail clothing, with a flowing beard and his hair tied in a ponytail. He listened for an hour as State\u2019s Attorney Anne Colt Leitess recounted previously undisclosed details of the attack. \u2026 If Ramos had not admitted committing the crimes outlined in the 23-count indictment, Leitess said, survivors would have testified that they had to step over the bodies of slain co-workers as they evacuated the building after police arrived.\u201d\n\n-- Charles J. Ogletree Jr., 66, the dazzling legal mind who inspired Barack and Michelle Obama at Harvard Law, represented Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings and became a crusader for civil rights, is now leading a quiet life at home with his wife, Pa,m following an Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis. From the Boston Globe: \u201cThree years ago, at 63, Ogletree went public with his battle. He named his nemesis and vowed to fight it, the way he\u2019d fought injustices so many times before. He is fighting still, holding onto what is left. But so much of who he was has been taken from him: Reading and writing. Traveling the world. Debate and discussion and his first great passion, fishing. The losses happen without ceremony. One day things are possible, another they are gone. They had told themselves they would not dwell on that. \u2018I want to focus on what I have,\u2019 Charles told Pam when he was diagnosed, \u2018not on what I\u2019m losing, or on what I had.\u2019 They pledged to stay in the moment, savor it. To spend their time living. And so as his world closes in, she pushes back. She plays the music he loved, tells him the old stories. In almost any kind of weather, they go walking. Charles always liked to walk, she says, but now he walks as if his life depends on it.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nHere's the declassified picture of the military pup that aided the Baghdadi raid:\n\nWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw \u2014 Donald J.
