Take no notice of what they say.'\n\n\n\nIn a police interview afterwards, Gascoigne told officers he only had 'three or four cans' prior to the incident because spirits made him 'spew up' following an operation.\n\nHe said during the interview: 'Before the operation I could drink gin no problem.'\n\nAsked whether Gascoigne regarded the kiss as sexual harassment, he responded: 'I get kissed all the time, so if that's the case I have been sexually harassed for 20 years.'\n\nHe also told officers that although the woman had not asked for the kiss, it was not sexual, adding: 'I'm not a serious guy, I enjoy life. I've got myself in trouble down the years.'\n\nYesterday, the court heard he forcefully kissed a woman on a train for 'three or four seconds'\n\nThe former midfielder said that the kiss itself was 'just a little peck', that no tongue had been involved and that it was not sexual.\n\nThe defendant said he had been kissed constantly, and jurors were shown a montage of images of Gascoigne kissing and being kissed by other people, featuring former footballers Steve Bull, Ian Wright, Ally McCoist and Wayne Rooney, as well as Princess Diana.\n\nHe said that, following his arrest, an officer had asked him about taking a selfie together at some stage.\n\nBritish Transport Police Pc Robert Moody told the court he arrested Gascoigne at the Jesmond Dene Hotel in Newcastle some hours after the incident.\n\nPc Moody said he saw Gascoigne sat in the foyer in an 'intoxicated, drunken state' with a glass of beer in his hand.\n\nGascoigne later told a custody sergeant: 'All I was doing was trying to help a fat lass.'\n\nProsecuting, William Mousley QC said: 'Instead of showing any real contrition, he lied by making up a story that he had overheard someone abusing her about her build and weight.\n\n'He had given her, he said, a peck on the lips to reassure her because he felt sorry for her. He appeared to indicate that what he had done was not serious and nothing to be bothered about.\n\n'He denied trying to sit on her and said that if his behaviour was sexual harassment then he had been a victim for 20 years or more, every time he had been kissed.\n\n'His lies were deliberate and told out of guilt but he was not prepared to face up to them.'\n\nSpeaking from behind a screen at Teesside Crown Court to maintain her anonymity, the victim said she 'completely froze' when Gascoigne kissed her on the mouth.\n\nShe added: 'He was trying to sit on my lap almost. I didn't want to make a fuss. I knew I was not too far from where I wanted to get off, I didn't want to do anything to antagonise him.\n\n'He kept saying 'sorry' and I kept just looking out of the window. He said 'sorry' a second time and then tapped my arm again and I turned around. He grabbed my face, kissed me full on the lips.\n\n'I was taken aback, it came completely out of the blue. I pushed him off, I pushed him away and said, 'that is not OK, get off '. It was on the mouth, I kept my mouth firmly shut, I just completely froze. It was sloppy, not a peck on the cheek that you might give someone, it was very full on the lips and it was forceful. He just kind of mumbled.'\n\nThe incident happened on a York to Newcastle train at Darlington (pictured in file photo)\n\nPassenger Rebecca Jacques sat across the aisle from Gascoigne.\n\nShe told the court she first became aware of him when he offered her a salmon bagel, which she could not eat because she was a vegetarian. She said: 'He put his hand on the lady's head and he put his tongue in her mouth. I was sitting side-on so I could see exactly what he had done.\n\n'It was clear he had got carried away with whatever he thought was going on.' Miss Jacques said Gascoigne told her what he did was 'fine'. 'I said to him, 'you cannot say that is fine, it is not fine what has happened'.\n\n'He said to me that it would not have been me because I was buck-toothed and ugly. I said to him, 'you can insult me all you like - it was sexual assault and you should not have done that.'\n\nHe was angry - he did not like that I was telling him off.' Miss Jacques said she had not recognised Gascoigne, and asked a male passenger why he had not done anything. He told her: 'It's Paul Gascoigne.'\n\nGascoigne denies one count of sexual assault.
