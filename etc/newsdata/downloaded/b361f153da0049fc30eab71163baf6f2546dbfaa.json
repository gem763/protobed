(Who among us has never made an email error? I once cc\u2019d an entire company saying I like jazz.) One of the more prominent Sunday-circuit crutches stated: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, there was no quid pro quo for Ukraine to get US aid in exchange for looking into Biden or his son.\u201d\n\nLate on Thursday, that argument collapsed when leaders of the House impeachment inquiry sent a public letter to House lawmakers, including 22 pages of text messages that former envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker provided in his House testimony \u2014 messages that he sent to European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland, Ukrainian administration staff, and former Ukraine ambassador Bill Taylor.\n\nNEW: Schiff/Engel/Cummings just sent this letter to House members, along with 22 pages of text messages Kurt Volker provided to the committees today. https://t.co/J3aWt9iYAk pic.twitter.com/8WPfcEeZeL \u2014 Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) October 4, 2019\n\nThree texts are worth highlighting, as they immediately shatter the notion that the administration did not engage in a quid pro quo when they withheld aid in order to influence Ukraine into investigating a political rival. On July 25, before Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky, Volker wrote to a top aide of the Ukrainian administration that he had \u201cheard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened in 2016,\u2019 we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nI don't see how it can be anymore clear cut than this. Zelensky gets a visit to White House (which he desperately wanted) in exchange for investigation of Biden & Clinton. This is from text sent before July 25th phone call. pic.twitter.com/tAJYpxRT1A \u2014 Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) October 4, 2019\n\nBy September 1, the you-investigate, we-provide-aid dynamic was established, as is apparent by Taylor\u2019s text to Sonland conveniently laying out the exchange Trump has been pining for.\n\nHouse chairs investigating Trump and Ukraine just released the full text messages that were leaked today between Kurt Volker, Gordon Sondland and Bill Taylor.\n\n\n\nThey are...explosive. https://t.co/YRppfhtFUZ pic.twitter.com/iCmV0zenH8 \u2014 Zach Basu (@zacharybasu) October 4, 2019\n\nPoor Gordon Sondland \u2014 All he wanted to do was to commit impeachable offenses, but over the phone. You can almost feel his face-palm in the acerbic \u201ccall me\u201d reply to Taylor, who appears to have never stepped into a law school classroom, or has never seen a mob movie. In another text from September 9, he outlines the plot even more explicitly: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland did his best to sneak in a whiff of plausible deniability: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d Good save.", "description": "Text messages sent from ex-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker to House Democrats shatter the idea that Trump wanted anything but an investigation in Ukraine in exchange for aid.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/25/25-trump-phone.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
