climate.\n\n\u201cThe east and southeast will be a parched grassland in the summer and, if there is livestock on it, it will be low stocking level. The lowland grassland plains will be much drier than we\u2019re used to and probably won\u2019t sustain wheat production because they will just be too dry.\n\n\u201cThis is unlike the lush grasslands that can support high stocking densities in the UK at the moment.\u201d\n\nAgriculture accounts for 72 per cent of land use in the UK and employs around 1 million people. Arable farming is generally more profitable than livestock farming, but poor soils and steep slopes in the north mean that it is currently often not a viable option.\n\nAlthough the overall picture is bad for farming, livestock farmers that are able to switch to arable farming might do better.\n\nDr Paul Ritchie, from the University of Exeter, said: \u201cBritain is relatively cool and damp, so a warmer and drier growing season is generally expected to increase arable production.\n\n\u201cCrops could still be grown with the aid of irrigation, but this would involve either storing large quantities of winter rainfall or transporting water from wetter parts of the country. The amount of water required would be vast, representing a major challenge for UK agriculture.\u201d\n\nPart of the impact of warmer conditions could be offset by higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2013 meaning plants will be able to use water more efficiently. This is because an enzyme contained in plants is more efficient when there is less oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\nResearchers say this is a crucial uncertainty in projecting the impact of climate change on farming land-use and needs to be researched further.\n\nThe paper was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council.", "description": "Climate change could turn the Garden of England\u00a0into a \u201cparched grassland\u201d that is unable to\u00a0support crops, according to a new study.\u00a0 Currently, cows and sheep are typically grazed in the north and west of Britain but, by 2100, warmer temperatures could force farmers to switch to more profitable arable farming.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/12/istock-585067052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
