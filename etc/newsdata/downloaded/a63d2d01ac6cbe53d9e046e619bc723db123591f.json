He\u2019s going to France, and I hope he has a very long, happy life.\n\n\u201cI hope he gets some better-looking brides now as well!.\n\n\u201cI am just so pleased to get a Group One for King Power.\u201d\n\nDe Sousa has had an injury-troubled season but this more than made up for the frustration of not being able to successfully defend his third jockey\u2019s crown.\n\n\u201cI wish the chairman could be here \u2014 he loved Ascot and having winners here,\u201d said De Sousa.\n\n\u201cI hope that wherever he is he can see this win.\n\n\u201cIt means everything to get one for King Power Racing.\u201d\n\nIt crowns a successful season for them which has seen them accrue over \u00a31million in prizemoney and almost 60 winners.\n\nDonjuan Triumphant\u2019s victory comes on a day when Leicester\u2019s fans are marching in tribute to Vichai and the four other victims of the crash from the city centre to the ground prior to their match.\n\nThe anniversary on October 27 will be marked by the club officially opening the Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Memorial Garden, \u201ca carefully developed, peaceful space, designed to protect the scene of the accident and form a permanent tribute to those so tragically lost a year ago.\u201d", "description": "Ascot (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Donjuan Triumphant, the first horse bought by the late Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, provided an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/f2c79f_leicester-city-late-owner-vichai-srivaddhanaprabha-had-big-ambitions-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
