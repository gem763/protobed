Two of his three Bundesliga strikes this season have come at home.\n\nCologne head into their fixture with Mainz on the back of a vital 3-0 victory over Paderborn\n\nSATURDAY\n\nBayern Munich vs Union Berlin\n\n2:30pm UK time\n\nThings have been going swimmingly for German giants Bayern in the Champions League - picking up maximum points from their opening three games - but the same can't be said in the Bundesliga.\n\nThey have tip-toed their way to just 15 points from their opening eight games, already drawing three and losing one in their worst start to a season for nine years. But they will be very confident of picking up victory when they host newly-promoted Union Berlin at the Allianz Arena.\n\nWhile it seems a huge uphill battle for Berlin in Munich, they can take some confidence from their 2-0 home victory over Freiburg last weekend that ended a four-match losing streak.\n\nFor Niko Kovac's Bayern side, who have struggled defensively so far this campaign, they will once again be hoping Robert Lewandowski can fire them to an emphatic victory as they look to push on in the title race.\n\nThe 31-year-old Poland international will break Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's record for goals scored in consecutive matches at the start of the season if he adds to his tally of 12 strikes this weekend.\n\nWhile at Dortmund, Aubameyang got on the scoresheet in the opening eight Bundesliga games of the 2015-16 season - something which Lewandowski has equalled.\n\nBayern have shone in the Champions League but have struggled so far in Bundesliga\n\nHertha Berlin vs Hoffenheim\n\n2:30pm UK time\n\nIt has been a very mixed start for Hertha Berlin and Hoffenheim, with both sides sitting level on 11 points from their opening eight matches.\n\nBut it appears that Hoffenheim are on their way up, stunning reigning Bundesliga champions Bayern 2-1 at the Allianz Arena before sealing a routine 2-0 win at home to David Wagner's Schalke in their last two matches.\n\nFor Ante Covic and his Hertha outfit, they will be desperate to bounce back from their 1-1 draw away at Werder Bremen, having won their previous three.\n\nHertha, who will be desperate to have centre-back Niklas Stark back from injury, will be wary of Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric. He marked his first appearance of the season in style against Schalke after a lengthy injury lay-off - scoring his 12th goal of the calendar year.\n\nFreiburg vs RB Leipzig\n\n2:30pm UK time\n\nSaturday's fixture at Freiburg should prove an extremely difficult task for Julian Nagelsmann and his Leipzig players, especially following their Champions League exploits during the week.\n\nLeipzig have failed to win any of their previous three Bundesliga games and sit fifth in the table, just a point above their opponents in what has been a topsy-turvy campaign so far.\n\nFreiburg also suffered huge disappointment last time out, falling to a shock 2-0 defeat away from home against newly-promoted Union Berlin.\n\nAnd inevitably the man to look out for will be Germany international Timo Werner, who will be hopeful of battling it out with Lewandowski to finish top scorer come the end of the season.\n\nThe 23-year-old striker already has six goals to his name, netting every 108 minutes so far in this season's Bundesliga.\n\nRB Leipzig travel to Freiburg on Saturday following their Champions League win over Zenit\n\nPaderborn vs Fortuna Dusseldorf\n\n2:30pm UK time\n\nFollowing their promotion from the second division, it has been grim viewing for Paderborn and their supporters so far, having picked up just one point from their opening eight matches.\n\nRelegation is already looming large for Paderborn, who last time out were heavily defeated 3-0 away by Cologne at RheinEnergieStadion.\n\nIf they are to have any chance of surviving come the end of the season, then they must beat the teams around them and the weekend meeting with Dusseldorf represents a good chance to get points on the board.\n\nThe visitors sit 13th on just seven points but they will be buoyed following their narrow 1-0 victory at home to Mainz and will be desperate to punish Paderborn, who have conceded 15 goals in their last five league games.\n\nSchalke vs Borussia Dortmund\n\n2:30pm UK time\n\nThe game on everyone's minds this weekend. The Revierderby has thrown up plenty of classics in the past, and fingers crossed another is in store at the Veltins-Arena on Saturday between these two fierce rivals.\n\nFans witnessed one of the most incredible derbies going back in 2017, when away side Schalke remarkably came from four goals behind inside the first 25 minutes to somehow draw 4-4 with all their strikes coming after the hour-mark.\n\nAnd Schalke will be desperate to clinch the bragging rights this Saturday after spurning the opportunity to go top of the table in their last two matches - drawing to Cologne before losing away at Hoffenheim.\n\nBut actually it's Dortmund who sit a point above their bitter rivals in the extremely tight Bundesliga table after beating Monchengladbach 1-0 in their last outing at Signal Iduna Park thanks to Marco Reus.\n\nDortmund must be very careful to keep their heads this weekend however, picking up eight red cards in games against Schalke - more than against any other club. Reus and Marius Wolf were sent off in the last meeting.\n\nDortmund beat Monchengladbach in their last outing thanks to Marco Reus' winning goal\n\nBayer Leverkusen vs Werder Bremen\n\nSunday 5:30pm UK time; live on BT Sport 2\n\nDespite losing at Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano to a late Alvaro Morata goal in midweek, Bayer Leverkusen will take plenty of confidence heading into the weekend's action.\n\nHowever, Leverkusen are set for a tough battle at the BayArena against Werder Bremen, who currently sit five points behind in 12th place.\n\nBoth sides came away with one victory each in their two meetings during the 2018-19 term but goals should be expected on Saturday evening. Last season's matches produced plenty of highlights, with there being a combined 12 goals on show.\n\nAnd both defences appear leaky at the start of this season, with Leverkusen conceding 11 already while the visitors have shipped in a massive 17 in total.\n\nSUNDAY\n\nWolfsburg vs Augsburg\n\nSunday 2:30pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 3\n\nThere have been contrasting fortunes for Wolfsburg and Augsburg so far with the season eight games down already. The former sit second, behind leaders Monchengladbach on goal difference while the latter sit third from bottom.\n\nWolfsburg, who were in Europa League action on Thursday night, have been very efficient in terms of producing results, scoring 11 but conceding only five - they currently hold the best defensive record in the league.\n\nThey will be very optimistic of maintaining the pace at the top of the table against an Augsburg side, who despite snatching an unlikely draw against Bayern last time out, have already been breached 21 times - the second most in the division.\n\nAnd with title challengers Dortmund up next for Wolfsburg on November 2 away from home, victory is imperative for Oliver Glasner's side.\n\nWolfsburg boast the best defensive record in the league after their impressive start so far\n\nBorussia Monchengladbach vs Eintracht Frankfurt\n\nSunday 5pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 3\n\nFrankfurt's trip to leaders Gladbach - who are top of the table for the first time since way back in 2011 - rounds off yet another action-packed weekend of Bundesliga football.\n\nDespite their narrow defeat by Dortmund last weekend, Gladbach have made a blistering start to the season under new manager Marco Rose, with his front three doing the damage so far.\n\nRose's preferred attacking trio of Breel Embolo, Alassane Plea and Marcus Thuram have 10 goals between them in the Bundesliga and will be hopeful of firing their side to a sixth victory of the season on Sunday.\n\nBut eighth-placed Frankfurt are by no means an easy task and the hosts should be very wary of Portuguese forward Goncalo Paciencia's threat. He netted twice against Leverkusen last weekend and has five goals in total so far.", "description": "Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig all sit a point behind  surprise leaders Monchengladbach in a very bunched up table.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20171118-0-image-a-4_1571991985415.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
