I ordered 'black shiny trousers' for Halloween but wtf are these boohoo.com?\n\n\"Name me a person who's gonna walk around sounding like a roll of f***ing cellotape?\n\n\"What's worse they stick together, I nearly fell over trying to walk.\"\n\nShe then went on to reference an iconic scene from the sitcom Friends, where Ross Geller has to cover his legs in talcum powder after his leather pants shrunk.\n\n\"And don't even get me started on trying to get the f***ers off either. I felt like Ross on Friends and nearly had to reach for the talc,\" she added.\n\nPeople on social media who saw the clip thought the whole thing was hilarious.\n\nOne person commented: \"Omg I am crying.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Pmsl, sounds like you need baby oil.\"\n\nA third added: \"I'm sure you have some WD40 about.\"\n\nSpeaking today, Abi said: \"When they arrived I thought 'what the f*** is this?'.\n\n\"I had to push my arm through the leg holes just to prise them apart as they were stuck together.\n\n\"It didn't take long to get into them, it was getting them off that was the problem. It took a few panic-stricken minutes. As I began to sweat they just stuck to my feet as I tried to pull them off.\n\n\"I don't know how or why they sell them. No one would wear them surely! They are so loud.\"\n\nShe added: \"I've had bin bags better quality.\"", "description": "An online shopper has shared a hilarious video of herself modelling vinyl trousers she purchased from Boohoo", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20679339.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Sticky_Boohoo_trousers_DN06JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
