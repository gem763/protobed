All words I\u2019ve heard, and I\u2019m sure many of our peoples have heard, to describe us, usually in a negative way for not \u201cfitting the mould\u201d. Yet there\u2019s never been a more exciting time to be disruptive, especially in the field of health.\n\nThis week the Australian Indigenous Doctors\u2019 Association is holding its annual conference on beautiful Larrakia country (Darwin) with the theme \u201cDisruptive Innovations in Healthcare\u201d, which frankly is well overdue. Mainstream healthcare systems designed by and for non-Indigenous people are not only less effective than community-controlled health organisations in improving outcomes for our peoples, they can be downright harmful.\n\nHealthcare systems in Australia that are considered \u201cmainstream\u201d are fundamentally colonial organisations: designed, established and informed by Western paradigms and biomedical models of care. As such, these healthcare systems, from tertiary level hospitals to local health services, are run by and for those who \u201cfit the norm\u201d.\n\nWhat is the norm, I hear you ask, and who defines this?\n\nAt present, the norm is those who will fit within the constraints of the Western worldview of health, including how healthcare is accessed, understood, adhered to and accepted.\n\nUltimately, this results in a health system which is not fit for purpose, fails to cater our peoples\u2019 values and results in many people not receiving the care they need.\n\nIt's black and white: racism in Australia is common and accepted | Marni Tuala for IndigenousX Read more\n\nFirst Peoples are the antithesis of colonial; we are inherently disruptive to how the healthcare system (and many other systems in fact) operate in Australia. Our disruption has historically been, and continues to be, rejected by the mainstream. Our unique lens, which views health as holistic and all-encompassing, has often been ignored or worse, considered inferior, as evidenced by a lack of traditional practices in these services.\n\nI acknowledge, however, that there are many impressive Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people working in health who are challenging these systems, and I recognise and deeply appreciate the many elders and ancestors before me who have tremendously fought for health systems designed by our ways of knowing, being and doing. Aboriginal community controlled health organisations have been incorporating First Peoples\u2019 unique worldview and practice of health for the last 40-plus years (or 60,000-plus years if we\u2019re acknowledging the traditional healthcare provided long before this).\n\nOur people drove this healthcare innovation, which has been a crucial step towards providing more culturally appropriate and safe care for our peoples, but there are still many healthcare services and hospitals that are dragging behind.\n\nIf innovation in healthcare is to be truly successful, it has to be across all levels and sectors of the system.\n\nWe need to see a transition from outdated approaches to health, such as those that only focus on the disease or illness, towards an approach that incorporates the whole person as well as their family, community and the social, cultural and environmental determinants that affect wellbeing.\n\nThis holistic method is something that has always been understood and enacted in healthcare by First Peoples, not just in Australia, but around the world.\n\nGlobally, we continue to see Indigenous excellence in healthcare.\n\nOne exemplary example is from Adelaide, where one hospital provides traditional healers, known as Ngangkari, to patients, so that both methods of healing are delivered within the same service. Similar practices have also been established in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and Turtle Island (North America).\n\nThese types of innovations are successful because there is a commitment from these services to embrace all knowledge systems and views of health and wellbeing.\n\nHealthcare systems don\u2019t just include hospitals and clinics. They also include the educational institutions that teach our health professionals. Hence, there is also a need to see change and innovation in the academy for medical and other health professionals\u2019 curriculum.\n\nAs a doctor, I have embraced disruption and have chosen to reject conventional medical training pathways. I have been drawn to the public health space because I recognised a need to look at health at a systemic level.\n\nJust as there is a strong need for doctors to be \u201con the ground\u201d disrupting systems in health services, there is an equally persistent need to be disrupting systems through education, research and advocacy.\n\nWe are beginning to see universities championing First Peoples\u2019 leadership in these areas, allowing for a process of decolonising medical curriculum and the way medicine is presented to future doctors. This type of disruptive innovation follows one simple principle. Equity.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve never been asked for our views before\u2019: giving families a voice | Lisa Rafferty for IndigenousX Read more\n\nEquity in healthcare is providing care that meets the needs of all and is inclusive of individual circumstances and values of health.\n\nBy this definition, equity of ideas or worldviews of health and wellbeing should have mutual respect, without hierarchy of knowledge systems.\n\nIf this is to happen to provide equity of healthcare for all, then there is a strong need for disruptive views and innovation in healthcare. Western medicine and First Peoples\u2019 medicine (or any other \u201calternative\u201d medicines for that matter) don\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive, but rather can and should coexist and learn from each other with reciprocity.\n\nWe are seeing Western medicine recognise its limitations and slowly move towards more holistic models of care, and there is now more than ever a pressing need and opportunity to broaden this even further.\n\nWe have a real opportunity to build a healthcare revolution and design a health system which is fit for all \u201cnorms\u201d.\n\nThere has never been a more exciting time to be disruptive.", "description": "To properly care for First Peoples\u2019 health, medical systems need to incorporate First Peoples\u2019 beliefs", "authors": ["Ngaree Blow For Indigenousx"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5dd459462498d3a3e7badc1d6bac7e95520f99/0_1321_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7fcb451328329c447fbf2258d7f9337b"}
