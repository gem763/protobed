Charlie Baker (R-MA) cited a public health emergency when the ban was made public.\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 decision led other New England states to follow suit.\n\nRhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-RI) signed an executive order last week banning the sale of flavored electronic nicotine-delivery system products, and Connecticut announced that they will look into a ban on flavored vaping products.\n\nVermont and Maine officials announced on Thursday said they are considering taking the same action to create a regional response to the national crisis.\n\nMichigan was the first state to ban flavored e-cigarettes on Sept. 4, and, 11 days later, New York announced a ban on flavored vaping products - which will be effective on Oct. 1.\n\nLast Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the death toll from vaping-related breathing illnesses has risen to 13, while there are now 80-5 confirmed and probable cases.\n\nMassachusetts has 61 suspected cases of vaping-related lung illness that have been reported to the state's Department of Public Health and no deaths.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to pass one set of rules in New York when they can just drive across the border to Connecticut and have a different set of rules and vice versa\" - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo\n\nAs Monday's lawsuit suggests, businesses in Massachusetts are not happy with the new legislation, which came with no prior notice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally a disaster for us. For the whole industry,\" Pete Patel, owner of Liquid Smoke & Vape Shop in Allston, Mass., told WBUR radio, \"Now we have to close down.\u201d\n\nPatel opened his store \u2013 which is lined with vaping products \u2013 just six months ago. Patel said those products accounted for 60 percent to 70 percent of his total sales, and without them, his business just can\u2019t survive.\n\n\u201cEverything now is zero value, you know,\u201d Patel said shortly after hearing about the ban. \u201cEverything is zero value for four months and we gonna lose the money, everything.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Cannabis Control Commissioner Shaleen Title -- who was appointed by Gov. Baker -- has concerns that people will look to the black market for vaping products and said the ban was a \"terrible decision\u201d which could lead people to get them on the unregulated market.\n\nThe ban is scheduled to be in effect until Jan. 25, 2020, and will be enforced by state and local officials. If businesses don't comply, Massachusetts\u2019 Department of Public Health says store owners could face fines, product seizures, or other penalties.\n\nThe response in the Empire State to the vaping ban has been swift. The New York State Vaping Association is likely filing a lawsuit that aims to reverse the ban, according to Spike Babaian, who owns several Vape New York shops in the city.\n\nThe lawsuit will seek to keep flavors on the market so they\u2019re accessible to adults that are looking for an alternative to smoking.\n\n\u201cEvery [vaping] business in New York would close within 30 days if they couldn\u2019t sell 90 percent of what they sell,\u201d Babaian said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody to go back to smoking because they can\u2019t access the product they use to keep them off cigarettes.\u201d\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D-CT) will attempt to execute an executive order to ban flavored vaping products, but it is not clear if he legally can do that. He also said he will ask legislators to enact a ban in a special session this fall or in the regular 2020 session.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do by executive order,\u201d Lamont said at a recent press briefing, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to be very strong going forward.\u201d\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) joined Lamont on Wednesday outside the Connecticut governor\u2019s residence, and he added, \u201cIt makes no sense to pass one set of rules in New York when they can just drive across the border to Connecticut and have a different set of rules and vice versa.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cuomo also said that a comprehensive approach does not mean all states must enact identical rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t agree on everything,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to. We\u2019re supposed to represent the people of our respective states. But the conversation is always good, the discussion is always good, and I believe we\u2019re going to find many common paths to a better future.\u201d\n\nCuomo also said that Connecticut must also end a five-year diversion of tobacco settlement funds away from cessation programs, but he did not pledge any specific funding level.\n\nLamont agreed, saying that - for Connecticut to work with its neighbors on a comprehensive approach to vaping - it will have to change its approach to cessation programs.\n\nSince 2000, Connecticut has received more than $2 billion as part of a multi-state legal settlement with the nation\u2019s five largest tobacco manufacturers, but only around $200 million of that has gone into the Tobacco and Health Trust, a special fund set up by legislators to fund anti-tobacco efforts. Lawmakers also took more than $113 million of that to help balance the budget.\n\n\u201cI know that over the last 10 years we\u2019ve been siphoning off some of the money that\u2019s supposed to go to tobacco cessation to other things,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to stop.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit was filed against e-cigarette maker Juul in the British Columbia Supreme Court, alleging the company targets minors and misleads consumers.
