We absolutely love a cheap drink, and I\u2019ve written countless articles about alcohol. There\u2019s also no doubt in my mind that the alcohol problem that Australia has is tumultuous, a systemic cycle that borders on toxic more often than not.\n\nBut what are the red flags to look out for when you have a sneaking suspicion that a mate, a family member, or even you, have a bad relationship with alcohol? And what can you do to help out? And can you be an alcoholic in your twenties?\n\nI spoke with Kevin Vun, a psychotherapist from The Indigo Project in Sydney, about maintaining a healthy relationship with alcohol, and what to do if you spot some warning signs from the ones you love.\n\nWhat are some red flags of someone with a toxic relationship with alcohol?\n\n\n\nTherapist Kev believes that there is a wide range of signs that could point toward an unhealthy relationship with alcohol \u2013 as, with all matters of the mind and the heart, it\u2019s not as simple as it seems.\n\nHe told me that there are a few common signs to be aware of, which include:\n\nDrinking alone, and feeling the need to hide this from people.\n\nFeeling like you only want to drink alone, and hide your behaviour from your friends may suggest there is something else at play behind your drinking.\n\nCraving alcohol.\n\nIf you have a serious compulsion to drink, where you physically, and/or psychologically need to drink.\n\nYou need to drink more to get drunk.\n\nWhile some people might be heavy drinkers, noticing that you are continuing to push your limits despite negative effects may be a sign.\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t stop drinking.\n\nSimilar to craving alcohol, when you can\u2019t stop when your body is telling you to, or when it is having a negative impact on the world around you.\n\nOver-relying on alcohol to cope or to get by.\n\nBeginning to rely on it to get through uncomfortable experiences in life, when alcohol becomes a crutch.\n\n\n\nAs for yourself, and any worries that you might be the one with the alcohol problem, Kev said that it\u2019s all about checking in with yourself from a place of kindness, so you don\u2019t freak out if you realise a hard truth.\n\nYou essentially want to pause, stop and notice \u2013 with kindness \u2013 what is going on in your life when you drink, when you aren\u2019t drinking, and after you\u2019re drinking. The last thing you want is to be freaking out, or hating yourself, for something that is most likely uncomfortable to admit.\n\nSo, what can I do if I think a friend might have an alcohol problem?\n\n\u201cI would be asking myself \u2013 how severe is this problem? There is a myriad of different situations, depending on your relationship with them,\u201d Kevin said.\n\n\u201cAre they at risk of harming themselves or another individual? If so, make sure you have emergency services ready on your phone.\u201d\n\nOn top of these first responses, Kev recommends a few simple things to do to help your mate, including:\n\nTaking care of them when they are drunk. Make sure they get home safe, or make them some toast and get some water or electrolytes into them if they come home drunk.\n\nSuggesting other things to do that doesn\u2019t involve alcohol. Kev suggested, \u201cstarting small\u201d with things like nights in with no or minimal drinks and be the one to initiate the decision to have a sober night.\n\nDon\u2019t be judgmental, or push your friend away. The last thing they need right now is people abandoning them. Your mate might potentially hurt you with their actions or behaviour, but Kev said to \u201cbe patient, kind, and understanding of them, supporting them when you can, and if you can\u2019t \u2013 and you\u2019re comfortable telling them why \u2013 express it to them gently.\u201d\n\nEducating yourself. Do some research into how to support a friend with an alcohol problem, or reach out to professionals. Help is always there. (Therapist Kevin and the Indigo Project team are really lovely, I promise.)\n\nWait so, can you actually be an alcoholic in your twenties?\n\nHoney, anyone can be anything \u2013 regardless of age. Our 20s, for a lot of people, is about trying on different hats, learning about friendships, relationships, what it means for one to be outside of school. You have more freedom to be an \u2018adult\u2019, whatever that means. And what comes with this space, is drinking \u2013 one of the most socially accepted drugs.\n\nWe are broadening our life experience, and sometimes we develop bad habits, get swept up with the wrong crowd, and things can get hard.\n\nSo when does a bad relationship with booze turn into alcoholism?\n\nKev said that more often than not, the transition from an alcohol problem into alcoholism happens slowly, and subtly.\n\nLife is full of variety, and the scope of the human experience is varied, but if you begin to notice some of the aforementioned signs, then maybe it\u2019s time to speak to someone. If you are beginning to question what\u2019s going on in your life, stop, pause, breathe, and see if there\u2019s a common denominator in life \u2013 aka alcohol. Then maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider your relationship with alcohol.\n\nHow can I help to break down that whole \u2018being sober is uncool\u2019 idea?\n\nLeading by example is the best way to help remove the negative taboos around staying sober. Kevin recommended doing activities and experiences that don\u2019t rely on alcohol to be fun and inclusive.\n\nHe also said that a huge part of breaking down these systemic thoughts is by having a good, honest chat with your mates about alcohol, and how you all interact with it.\n\n\u201cHave open, respectable, and judgement-free conversations around drinking and being sober, but be open to people\u2019s choices,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOne might enjoy drinking from time to time, the other a wine, another still likes to party, and one might be a teetotaler. Respect their choices, understand it, talk about it if it helps you.\u201d\n\nThe last piece of sage advice from Therapist Kevin is all about going \u201cback to basics\u201d \u2013 if you\u2019re worried about a friend, or yourself having an alcohol problem, try and lean back on things you and your mates love to do that doesn\u2019t involve alcohol.\n\nGo climbing, kick a footy, have a crafternoon, do some work in the garden, hang out and shoot the shit.
