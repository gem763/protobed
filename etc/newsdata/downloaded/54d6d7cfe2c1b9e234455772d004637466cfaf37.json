The 5th Ave. Apple Store, situated underground beneath its iconic glass cube, has been closed since 2017 while Apple expanded and reworked its layout.\n\nCook and Apple senior vice president of people and retail Deirdre O'Brien opened the doors of the store promptly at 8 a.m., inviting throngs of fans who waited in line to tour the subterranean retail location and, more importantly for Apple, get their hands on the newly launched $699 iPhone 11, $999 iPhone 11 Pro, and $1,099 iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nCook arrived at the event shortly before the start of the festivities, stepping onto the sidewalk on 5th Ave. from his car, before shaking hands, petting dogs, and taking selfies with the Apple faithful.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook pets a very good dog at the re-opening of the company's flagship store.

Downstairs in the store, Cook toured the displays, each meticulously aligned.\n\nCook's presence at the revamped Apple store was evocative of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' appearance at the store's opening in 2006. The location has been an icon for the store and Apple fans around the world thanks to its unique design.\n\nIt's also one of the most visited tourist spots in New York, surpassing both the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty with 57 million people passing through annually, according to Apple.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook tours the company's re-opened flagship store in Manhattan.

The phones each sport all-new cameras, including ultra-wide angle cameras that allow you to capture more content in a single frame. A new low-light photo mode helps capture images in dim lighting, though, you'll have to stay still while capturing them.\n\nThen there's the battery life. Apple says the iPhone 11 gets an hour more battery life than its predecessor the iPhone XR. The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, meanwhile, get four hours and five hours more than the iPhone XS and XS Max.\n\nAll three phones are available now, though you might want to call ahead to your local Apple Store to see if they're still in stock.\n\nMore from Dan:\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook met with fans and diehards waiting to get a look at Apple's newly re-opened flagship store in Manhattan.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nIwD91.XVmgX5vWIRnArnw--~B/aD04MzQ7dz0xMzg2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/088ecef0-dbd3-11e9-9be3-4b424e4d95a8", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
