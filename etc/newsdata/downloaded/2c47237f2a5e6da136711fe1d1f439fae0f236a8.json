Gerald Baliles has entered a specialized care program for complications arising during his ongoing battle with kidney cancer.\n\nA statement from 79-year-old Baliles\u2019 family says the former Democratic governor has been fighting a type of kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma for several years.\n\nThe family says that in 2016, he had a tumorous kidney removed and began treatment for cancer cells that had migrated to his lungs. The Roanoke Times reports that a recent diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease, required additional treatment and Baliles has now entered a palliative care program.\n\nBaliles served as governor from 1986 to 1990. The newspaper says he oversaw transportation improvements, reformed the state\u2019s income tax structure and focused on state education and economic development efforts, among other contributions.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Roanoke Times, http://www.roanoke.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Virginia Gov.
