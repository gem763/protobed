It calls on other cities, states and the federal government to do the same.\n\nThe resolution from the board of supervisors \u2014 and 11-member legislative group representing the city and county \u2014 is mostly symbolic, and does not have a direct impact on local policy.\n\nIt was passed weeks after a mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in the San Francisco Bay Area, where three people were killed and 12 were injured. The resolution notes that there have been more mass shootings than days in 2019.\n\nThe NRA tweeted Wednesday calling the resolution \"a reckless assault on a law-abiding organization, it's members, and the freedoms they all stand for.\"\n\n\"We remain undeterred - guided by our values and belief in those who want to find real solutions to violence,\" the NRA said.\n\nThe NRA has consistently opposed gun control efforts and financially supported politicians who oppose them as well. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre spoke with President Trump on the phone last month in the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Soon after the call, Mr. Trump backed away from his previous calls for stronger background checks \u2014 something the NRA has lobbied against.", "description": "\"The leadership of National Rifle Association promotes extremist positions,\" the resolution says", "authors": ["Jason Silverstein"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/5043a871-aac6-4969-8cb8-3a761f3e9e89/thumbnail/1200x630/fa2a259b90d4d5d134543d6c0b4371a9/gettyimages-469199110.jpg"}
