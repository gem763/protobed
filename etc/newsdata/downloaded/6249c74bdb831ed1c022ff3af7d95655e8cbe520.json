People noticed that the blocks are slow and only partially full, and it turned out that an unknown miner controlled 50% of the network hash rate. Still, it seems that the coin\u2019s price wasn\u2019t affected. As a matter of fact, while all this was developing, BCH price was rising.\n\nAt pixel time (15:02 UTC), BCH trades at c. USD 263 and is almost unchanged in the past 24 hours, while BTC is down by 1.65%. BCH is up by almost 13% in the past week.\n\nBCH price chart:\n\n___\n\nHashrate comparison\n\n30 day moving average. Source: Bitinfocharts.com\n\nWhile slow blocks are certainly not a novelty, BCH blocks have raised some eyebrows recently as they seem to have been slow and partially full, and according to a recent tweet by a user called \u2018dennis\u2019, instead of c. 10 minutes, BCH had a three hour time between blocks. \u201cWhen a block was finally produced, it was only 2.4MB (less than 10% of the 32MB cap),\u201d says the user. \u201cHashpower was 0.1% of Bitcoin\u2019s. Someone needs to put this coin out of its misery.\u201d\n\nBitcoin educator Andreas M. Antonopoulos explained that the BCH chain switched to a different mining difficulty targeting algorithm from the BTC chain after the fork in 2017. \u201cThere appear to be some problems with BCH mining,\u201d he said, \u201cperhaps related to the difficulty re-targeting algorithm. Many people have shared their opinions on why this happened:\n\nSo far, my best guess about the sudden \"drop\" of BTC hashrate is that it's a combination of 3 factors:\n\n- miners switching to BCH after penultimate BTC diff. adjustement,\n\n- miners switching back and forth between BTC and BCH to \"abuse\" BCH adjustement algo,\n\n- bad luck on BTC chain \u2014 LaurentMT (@LaurentMT) September 29, 2019\n\nHowever, Antonopoulos added: \u201cIt also appears one entity is now in effective control of mining.\u201d Similarly, Jameson Lopp, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of crypto security specialist Casa, noticed that \u201cBitcoin Cash's improved Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm was supposed to reduce block time variance, but that \u201cit's looking rather volatile lately, often seeing hourlong periods with 2 blocks or with 20+ blocks.\u201d User \u2018zender\u2019 however suggested that BCH is undergoing an attack.\n\nMy take why I think BCH is undergoing an attack which will drive their hashrate down.https://t.co/MEchtipna8 \u2014 zender \ud83d\udee1 (@zndtoshi) October 27, 2019\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nThe information, apparently first posted on Reddit, rushed through the Cryptosphere that there seemed to have been an attack on the BCH network, and that there is a miner controlling 50% of the network\u2019s hash rate. This is of major importance, as the person or a group that controls the majority of the network effectively controls the entire thing, which might be used against the network.\n\nIn his Twitter thread, \u2018hash.fail,\u2019 self-identified as a Blockchain research specialist, said that \u201cthere is *enormous cause for concern* as the entity in question on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain essentially has full control over the chain at this point in time.\u201d The research specialist continues, explaining that an educated guess about who mined a given block can be made from the address receiving 'coinbase' transaction [block reward] and/or the mining pools that sign blocks, he says. These are some of the conclusions he makes in regards to the address in question:\n\nit has been the recipient of countless coinbase rewards, which would suggest that its working in unison with whatever entity/entities it\u2019s attached to;\n\nthe address is not only dominating in terms of percentage of blocks found/won, but it is also finding blocks \u201cat an absurd rate,\u201d with 24 blocks found in just two hours on October 26th, instead of an expected average of 6 blocks/hour.\n\nwith this \u2018unknown\u2019 entity finding 24 blocks in 2 hours, \u201cit is not only beating out the entire network, it\u2019s pretty much 'broken' the retargeting algorithm for BCH\u201d;\n\nat one point, \u2018unknown\u2019 has won 8/14 blocks, meaning that \u201cbetween this entity & BTC.top, no one else has won a block on the protocol (besides BTCC) since block 606283\u201d;\n\nadditionally, 21 blocks have been found in an hour;\n\nBCH developers \u201care aware of the problem,\u201d but \u201cthere's nothing that they can realistically do about the situation since it\u2019s out of their hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is strongly recommended that users *avoid transacting on or with BCH at any and all costs* until this issue is resolved,\u201d \u2018hash.fail\u2019 concludes.\n\nBut this is not the end of potential problems, as some suggest that BCH could now be attacked by a larger number of entities.\n\nExchanges should act accordingly and get ready to require at least 6 conf per 10 000$ deposited. \u2014 Dr. Checksum 0. Zero, Ph.D. (@checksum0) October 26, 2019\n\nAnd miners could be facing additional consequences as well:\n\nAlso this means that the attacker can switch to bch to mine a lot of blocks while the \"honest\" bch miners will just pay a lot for the electricty during the \"slow periods\". This effectively will decrease revenue of the bch miners and they could be forced to move the BTC mining. \u2014 zender \ud83d\udee1 (@zndtoshi) October 27, 2019\n\nPeople continue to debate what exactly happened, with a number of different theories going around the Cryptoworld, including the one by a Redditor 'bitmeister' saying that they \u201cthink this is a sign of the approaching [mining reward halving],\u201d and that \u201cwe will likely see more miners experimenting and playing with their otherwise useless BTC hashpower by pointing it at BCH.\u201d", "description": "While the Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate is breaking records, its fork, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), seems to have run into some troubles.
