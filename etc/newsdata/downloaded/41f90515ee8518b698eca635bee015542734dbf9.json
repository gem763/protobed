They are quite confident that they have what people want.\"\n\nThe e-commerce giant late Thursday reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations. The company also gave disappointing revenue guidance for the holiday shopping season.\n\nHowever, revenue in the third quarter beat estimates and grew 24% to $70 billion, suggesting a heavy investment in free, one-day shipping was translating into more purchases.\n\nCramer said it's clear that customers want one-day delivery \u2014 predicting that by the middle of next week investors will realize that Amazon made the right move in heavily financing its new delivery standard, which will make one-day shipping the default for Prime members.\n\nAmazon spent more than $800 million in each of the last two quarters to expand free, one-day delivery to more products and more regions. The company expects to spend another $1.5 billion on the initiative during the fourth quarter to expand its warehouse footprint and product selection.\n\n\"The people who are worried about Amazon are the same people who turn on Amazon time and time again,\" Cramer added. \"Amazon is doing what the customer wants, then it tries to figure out how to do it more cheaply.\"", "description": "\"This stock is a buy by next week, mid-week,\" advising investors to wait until the selling clears out before getting in, says CNBC's Jim Cramer.", "authors": ["Jessica Bursztynsky"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104326296-20150310-8625-1120.JPG?v=1488902930", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
