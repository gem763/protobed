They both pride themselves on going the distance and not being physically dominated and what is expected to be the tightest of contests is more likely to be decided by a mistake rather than a moment of brilliance.\n\nEvery Wales player who has been on media duty this week has said the same thing, following the lead taken by their head coach, Warren Gatland. The quarter-final victory over France was notable for the result rather than the performance and a repeat against the Springboks will result in a flight home next Saturday rather than an appearance in the final.\n\n\u201cFrance were the better team on the day and the match was decided by a red card,\u201d said the Wales prop Tomas Francis whose battle up front against Tendai \u201cBeast\u201d Mtawarira will be one of the key individual contests. \u201cWe stuck in there and while we were not too happy with the performance, we are not dwelling on it but making sure we step up as a pack.\n\n\u201cWe were not good enough against France. We let them outmuscle us a bit and we were not pleased. A lot of it is about attitude and we showed that, especially when Ross [Moriarty] received a yellow card shortly after coming on. We stayed strong and we know the threats South Africa will pose.\u201d\n\nWales made three changes from the team that defeated France through Moriarty\u2019s late try. Two were enforced with Josh Navidi\u2019s tournament ending that afternoon when he suffered a hamstring injury while Liam Williams damaged ankle ligaments in training this week after colliding with a teammate.\n\nMoriarty replaces Navidi while Leigh Halfpenny takes over from Williams at full-back. The Lions centre Jonathan Davies, who pulled out last week because he felt he had not fully recovered from the knee injury he sustained against Fiji in the third round, resumes his partnership with Hadleigh Parkes.\n\nPlay Video 1:10 'I believe there\u2019s a dream': Gatland urges Wales to reach World Cup final \u2013 video\n\n\u201cWhen you have a player of Leigh\u2019s ability and achievement coming into the side it shows the strength in depth that we have built up,\u201d said Francis. \u201cThe same with Ross in the back row. South Africa beat us in the last World Cup with a try late on in the quarter-final and we have not forgotten that.\u201d\n\nErasmus adamant Cheslin Kolbe had to be sidelined for Wales encounter Read more\n\nGatland predicted at the start of the year that Wales would win the Six Nations, which they did. He then said he believed they were good enough to lift the World Cup. His players are two matches away from proving him right.\n\n\u201cWinning the World Cup is one of the things you have to dream about and I am probably the greatest optimist in terms of believing something is possible and that there is a dream,\u201d said Gatland.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that attitude and portray it, it will not happen. A big part of success is the belief and the desire to do something. That is what we will be building on in the next two days and I want to go back to New Zealand with my head held high.\n\nQuiz: how much do you know about Rugby World Cup semi-finals? Read more\n\n\u201cI thought we handled the end against France outstandingly after we had gone in front and you could see in the body language of their players that they did not expect to beat us. In the past, we might have panicked or got nervous but we were composed. That is something you cannot coach and which players have to learn themselves.\u201d\n\nGatland said Wales were braced for the physical approach of South Africa who battered Japan into submission to reach the last four and predicted an ugly kick-fest.\n\n\u201cWe have played some big teams in this tournament already,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a World Cup semi-final and we have to bring our own physicality, something that is always important against South Africa. They have improved under Rassie Erasmus and gone back to their strengths, but I am looking forward to this game more than I was last week and I am more confident.\u201d", "description": "The loss of Lions\u2019 full-back Liam Williams for Sunday\u2019s semi-final against South Africa does not weaken Wales, according to coach Warren Gatland", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7edeceefa6e4838111f209280e72329049e9072/0_148_8400_5041/master/8400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e4230c5501de84e5cc311027319850cb", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
