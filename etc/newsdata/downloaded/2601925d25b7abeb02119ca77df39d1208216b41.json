She was so drunk all she could say to police was 'I did not touch no one'.\n\nMadison's lawyer, Rebecca Hudson, told the court the casual cleaner drank two bottles of liquor that day because it 'settled the PTSD' from a violent past relationship.\n\nMadison ran over to the pair and invited them to 'join the party', which the officers refused - but she wasn't taking no for an answer\n\nShe grabbed one of them by her jacket with both hands and yelled in her face 'I'm going to get my family to bash you'\n\nThe mother-of-two had been seeing a psychologist since June to deal with these issues, Ms Hudson told the court.\n\nProsecutor Len Brown said the concern for the victim was the potential transmission of disease but noted spitting on her face was unintentional.\n\n'It is not alleged that it was the intention of the defendant to spit in the face of the victim, the assault was the pulling of the victim's jacket,' he said.\n\nMagistrate Cathy Wadley fined Madison $600 without a conviction recorded.", "description": "Ruth Madison, 32, grabbed the firefighter by her jacket with both hands and yelled in her face 'I'm going to get my family to bash you' after they walked past the campfire romp in Charters Towers.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20014988-0-image-a-2_1571705481260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
