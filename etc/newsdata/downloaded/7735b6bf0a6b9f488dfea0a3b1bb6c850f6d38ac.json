Now, it wants to be known for producing the least amount of pollution, too.\n\nOn October 16th, the China-owned / Sweden-based automaker unveiled its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge. Everything about the reveal event was understated: the stage was small, the SUV was compact, and the backdrop was a pink so soft you could almost call it rose. Sure, there was a little dry ice and some EDM when the car was revealed, but Volvo was less concerned with the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and more concerned with the message.\n\nVolvo was less concerned with the mise en sc\u00e8ne, and more concerned with the message\n\nBut there was still a car to consider. The XC40 Recharge won\u2019t blow people away or engender rapturous headlines in the same way as the Tesla Model 3 or the Porsche Taycan. The least you can say about it is that it looks almost exactly like the gas-powered XC40, just without a front grille and a tailpipe.\n\nThe real differences, of course, are just beneath the surface. The battery pack, stuffed into the floor of the vehicle, is encased in a neon orange aluminum case that Volvo is calling \u201ca safety cage.\u201d Embedded in the middle of the car\u2019s body, the safety cage creates a built-in crumple zone around the battery. Leave it to Volvo to put as much thought into keeping passengers safe as it does its drivetrain.\n\nInterestingly enough, the battery almost ended up being much weaker, with fewer cells and less capacity, than what was eventually decided upon. According to Henrik Green, Volvo\u2019s chief technology officer, the company\u2019s engineers were halfway through the XC40 Recharge\u2019s development cycle when something big happened in the EV space that threw them for a loop: the unveiling of the Model 3.\n\nWhen Volvo learned that the Model 3 would have a range of over 300 miles, the company\u2019s engineers set to work to do what they could to increase their own range by upgrading the vehicle\u2019s battery. \u201cWe decided to go for a bigger size than we originally thought,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cThat was not a fun decision.\u201d\n\nThat meant contacting the automaker\u2019s battery suppliers, South Korea\u2019s LG Chem and CTAL in China, to add modules to its battery to improve the performance. If customers wanted electric cars with bigger batteries and longer ranges, then Volvo would have to deliver, he said. \u201cThat was not a fun decision,\u201d Green added, \u201cbeing adamant about quality and everything about producing vehicles, doing that very late in the program was super critical.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where things ended up: the car\u2019s powertrain offers a range of over 400 kilometers on a single charge based on Europe\u2019s WLTP standard, or 200-plus miles in the US, though the automaker has yet to obtain an official EPA rating. It will have an output of 408 horsepower (or 402 hp in the US), and the battery charges to 80 percent of its capacity in 40 minutes on a fast-charger system.\n\nAnother crucial decision was the one to work hand-in-glove with Google to embed the tech giant\u2019s Android Automotive software in the car. That meant replacing Volvo\u2019s own operating system with Google\u2019s \u2014 something that most other car companies have been hesitant to do. Green said one of the motivating factors was making a car with one of the best voice assistants on the market today. \u201cHonestly speech functions in cars typically suck today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a nice experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly speech functions in cars typically suck today.\u201d\n\nGreen predicts that other OEMs will follow suit once they realize that the voice assistants they are trying to develop fall short of the standard set by Google, Amazon, and others working in this space.\n\n\u201cI just came to the conclusion that there is no chance on earth that a car company, with the volume we have, with the power we have, would compete on probably one of the biggest battles going on in tech today,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should the car industry be there, up against the Amazons and the Googles and the Apples, on who\u2019s going to build the best assistant in the world? It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an obvious choice: Volvo is a luxury marque, and Android is closely associated with mass-market phones. Still, Green calls the collaboration between the two companies \u201cthe perfect match.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an obvious choice maybe, but it certainly has obvious advantages. The native Android Auto infotainment system means the XC40 Recharge can receive over-the-air software updates. So while the car\u2019s driver-assist system isn\u2019t nearly as advanced as Tesla\u2019s Autopilot or GM\u2019s Super Cruise, it can get better once Volvo develops the right software. And then it can simply push out an update to its entire fleet.\n\nThe XC40 isn\u2019t the first vehicle in Volvo\u2019s lineup to get the embedded Android Auto operating system; that would be the Polestar 2 from the automaker\u2019s performance sub-brand. The XC40 bears a lot of similarities to the Polestar 2. Both cars are slated to go on sale in 2020, but the XC40 Recharge is less expensive and higher volume than Polestar, so it will obviously reach more customers.\n\nThe XC40 is just the first in what will eventually be an entire lineup of electric cars. And Volvo is taking a more holistic view by promising to reduce its own carbon footprint by 40 percent by 2025. The company has big goals, and it all starts with this compact SUV. It\u2019s a modest start to a very transformative endeavor.\n\nPhotography by Andrew J. Hawkins / The Verge", "description": "Volvo has unveiled its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge.
