New evacuation orders were put in place for a portion of Lake County as the fire was expected to move eastward.\n\n\u201cWe are fully capable and ready to respond to all of the state\u2019s fire emergencies plus going through this part of the season,\u201d Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said, according to The Bee. \u201cI want you to feel very confident that the fire service system and emergency response system is ready for California\u2019s emergencies going into the rest of this fire season.\u201d\n\nFirefighters braced for high winds to return by Tuesday, with gusts expected to reach 60 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Officials said the fire was about 15 percent contained as of Monday evening, an improvement from just 5 percent containment earlier in the day. Winds in the region briefly died down Monday, allowing firefighters to catch up to the blaze.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing both offense and defense right now on two different sides of the fire, and we\u2019re going to have to flip-flop that tomorrow when that wind event comes through,\u201d Cal Fire Division Chief Jonathan Cox said at a Monday night news conference.\n\nThe windstorm prompted officials to issue \u201cred flag\u201d warnings for \u201ccritical\u201d fire weather in most of the Bay area from early Tuesday until Wednesday afternoon as the blaze may spread rapidly and become more difficult to control. The Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Monday permitted residents in two evacuation zones west of the metropolitan hub of Santa Rosa along the Pacific Coast to return home but warned they may need to leave again should conditions worsen, the Post reported.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Monday issued a state of emergency as several wildfires blazed across the state, including the Getty Fire near Los Angles.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric company on Monday made the decision to cut power for about 600,000 northern and central California customers amid high wind conditions, The Bee reported. The power utility company implemented a historically large blackout over the weekend on nearly 1 million customers, prompting criticism from officials who questioned what Newsom was doing to ensure veterans hospitals and other facilities could remain in operation.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the Sonoma County fairground Monday evening, Newsom said PG&E had to \u201cget their act together,\u201d as widespread blackouts could not be the new normal in its approach to high wind wildfire conditions. He added a major investigation by the public utilities commission would assess the company's protocol.", "description": "Strengthening and shifting winds on Tuesday are expected to reenergize the Kincade Fire, placing red flag weather warnings into effect for most of the San Francisco Bay Area as northern California\u2019s sweeping wine country battles what\u2019s now the largest fire in the state this year for the fifth day in a row.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/52057412-AP19300450007698.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
