Speaking about it now to Metro.co.uk, he insisted it was their choice not to watch it, but he feels if they did he\u2019d \u2018still be picking up the pieces\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s my job to pre-empt the bad stuff; re-experiencing watching your mum die, it\u2019s going to be a new experience as teens. To experience with a greater level of understanding and comprehension,\u2019 Jeff, 40, told us.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not trying to make them forget, that is the complete opposite. I\u2019m all up for maintaining the memory and keeping the love and they have a great sense of who mum was.\n\nJade Goody passed away 10 years ago from cervical cancer (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018That documentary was not the right way to learn about their mum. There is some really adult, complicated things in it.\n\n\u2018I got the godparents together to make sure there are more voices than my own. Those pre-emptive chats are vital; I\u2019d probably still be picking up the pieces now. It\u2019s there whenever they want to watch them \u2013 I won\u2019t be able to stop them. But I want them to do it when they feel ready.\u2019\n\nWhen it comes to speaking about Jade and keeping her legacy alive, Jeff insisted it\u2019s going to be \u2018impossible\u2019 for his sons to forget every memory they have of her, as he continues to teach them about the woman she was.\n\nJeff with his sons and partner Kate (Picture: Instagram/jeffbrazier)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t feel a responsibility to [speak about her] publicly, but there absolutely is a responsibility for me to do that privately,\u2019 he said. \u2018Every time I take them to the grave, every time we talk about her, every time they see their godparents, you\u2019re being respectful to her and I guess doing what I would hope she would have done for me if the roles were reversed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s impossible for them to forget and not have those memories, she was far too important.\u2019\n\nAs life continues to go along for Jeff and his family, he recently revealed his eldest Bobby has just gained an apprenticeship and is on the job learning after some stellar GCSE results.\n\nGaining a level of \u2018freedom\u2019 back in his life as his sons grow up and become young men, capable of looking after themselves, Jeff is excited about the next chapter.\n\nThe TV presenter has been supporting McDonald\u2019s Ronald McDonald House Charities UK on its latest campaign. Showing the benefits of the charity\u2019s new fundraising methods, introducing a \u2018rounding-up\u2019 system at the tills when you order, Jeff visited families at Evelina House and spoke to those who benefit most.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve gone into McDonald\u2019s for 30 odd years and I\u2019ve never questioned what those collection boxes are on the counter. Those donations go towards helping families stay near their sick children while they\u2019re in hospital by providing the free home away from home accommodation,\u2019 he explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When you consider a cashless society, charities have been affected. If it wasn\u2019t for that accommodation near the hospital, how on Earth would [parents] juggle work and other kids and everything life entails while trying to be that parent by their children. For some it would be absolutely impossible.\u2019\n\nGoing through what he went through during Jade\u2019s treatment, in and out of hospital with his young sons, does he find he\u2019s in a better position to empathise with the struggles of families in RMH?\n\nJeff uses his platform on good causes (Picture: BACKGRID UK)\n\n\u2018I can always show a lot of empathy, life experiences, negative ones will always be negative and moving forward it at least enables you to be a person that can show the right attitude towards others,\u2019 Jeff said.\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s part of being human. I would not want to be a version of myself that didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s journeys, that would feel quite numb. I am grateful that I\u2019m able to feel people.\u2019\n\nFinding more time to get back into football presenting on the weekends, now his boys are finding their way in the word, Jeff admits he feels proud of loosening the reins on his boys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018For the past 11 years it\u2019s been all on me, the point I\u2019ve got [Bobby] from school stage to work stage feels important and it\u2019s freed something up for me. I feel less pressure, because he\u2019s out there and doing things for himself,\u2019 Jeff enthused, revealing he was getting back into football presenting.\n\n\u2018I like the idea of him now taking the reins and being on his way\u2019\n\nJeff is supporting McDonald\u2019s raising money for the Ronald McDonald House Charities UK. Customers are now able to donate to the charity at kiosks in McDonald\u2019s restaurants.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
