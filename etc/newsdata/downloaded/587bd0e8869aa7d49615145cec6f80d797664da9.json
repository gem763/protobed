Flowers have been planted and red lanterns hung along all the major thoroughfares of Beijing. Almost 100,000 people have been practicing their formations in Tiananmen Square.\n\nThe Communist Party is ready to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1 with the kind of military extravaganza that only Stalinist states can pull off.\n\nIt ought to be a particularly sweet anniversary for China\u2019s leaders: Their Communist state has now lasted longer than the Soviet Union, which endured for 69 years.\n\nBut it is not. The months-long standoff between the party and the millions who have been protesting in Hong Kong is set to come to a head on Oct. 1, when the demonstrators plan to stage a counter-rally.\n\n\u201cA confrontation of monumental proportions is coming up,\u201d said Orville Schell, a China specialist at the Asia Society. \u201cClearly, something will happen on Oct. 1.\u201d\n\nChinese officials have been going to great lengths to ensure \u201cstability\u201d in Beijing on the day of the parade. Homing pigeons and kite-flying have been banned. Airports and train stations are planning extra security checks. Local journalists have been told to report only good news, and foreign ones have been told to stay off their office balconies to avoid being shot by snipers. The skies have been ordered to be blue.\n\n\n\nMilitary aircraft fly over a trail of colored smoke in Beijing on Sunday.

Britain invaded Hong Kong in 1841 at the beginning of the First Opium War, when it forcibly redressed its trade imbalance with China by getting people addicted to the narcotic.\n\n\n\nStreets were shut down for the parade rehearsal. (Jason Lee/Reuters)\n\nThese factors make the expression of a different kind of Chinese dream in Hong Kong and Taiwan inconvenient, to say the least, for the Communist Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of counter dream, one with a more cosmopolitan view of Chinese-ness and a more inclusive view of Chinese-ness that\u2019s separate from the Chinese Communist Party but linked up to things that really fit in with the Chinese tradition,\u201d said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China at the University of California at Irvine.\n\nIndeed, the \u201cChinese Dream\u201d has almost zero appeal in Hong Kong, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the Hong Kong and Chinese identities had always been distinct, but they have been diverging since 2012,\u201d Cabestan said. That was the year mainland Chinese patriotic education, including a book titled \u201cThe China Model,\u201d extolling the Communist Party, was introduced into Hong Kong schools.\n\n\u201cMore and more Chinese young people think that they can\u2019t be both,\u201d Cabestan said. \u201cThey might feel Chinese, but they don\u2019t feel PRC. That\u2019s why the Chinese Communist Party feels threatened.\u201d\n\nA survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong in June found that the percentage of people who identified as Chinese had fallen to a record low.\n\nOnly 11 percent of the 1,015 respondents said they were Chinese. More than half \u2014 53 percent \u2014 described themselves as Hong Kongers. Twenty-three percent said they were \u201cHongkongers in China.\u201d When asked whether they were proud of being a Chinese national, 71 percent said no. That rose to 90 percent for respondents aged 18 to 29.\n\n[Hong Kong activists press U.S. to counter China\u2019s erosion of city\u2019s freedoms ]\n\nWhile Hong Kongers say they have felt more distance from the mainland, they say they also have begun to feel closer to Taiwan.\n\nIn 2014, Hong Kong and Taiwan saw large-scale demonstrations bristling against the mainland\u2019s influence.\n\nHong Kongers took to the streets in their Umbrella Movement to protest Beijing\u2019s increasing intervention in their governance. Young people in Taiwan launched the Sunflower Movement to oppose greater integration with mainland China.\n\n\u201cSince 2014, since the Sunflower and the Umbrella movements, they have felt that they share the same values,\u201d Cabestan said.\n\nThis poses an existential challenge to Xi, whose top priority is the perpetuation of Communist Party rule over a rejuvenated greater China.\n\nIn the years since Hong Kong\u2019s return from British control in 1997, Beijing held up the territory as an example of what the future could hold for Taiwan: a vibrant Chinese territory with a degree of autonomy. Hong Kong held the promise of how the \u201cOne country, two systems\u201d framework could work for Taiwan.\n\nBut since 2014, that promise has begun to look more like a threat.\n\n\u201cWith the umbrella movement, the protesters in Hong Kong began to say: \u2018Look Taiwan, Hong Kong today could be Taiwan tomorrow,\u2019 but in a warning sense,\u201d Wasserstrom said.\n\nNow, five years on from those protests \u2014 and five years of increasingly authoritarian leadership under Xi \u2014 young people in Hong Kong and Taiwan are finding more concerns in common.\n\nAfter the Hong Kong protests began in June, demonstrators in Taiwan took to the streets chanting \u201cTaiwan cheng Hong Kong,\u201d using the Mandarin word for \u201csupport.\u201d\n\nThen musicians from Taiwan and Hong Kong joined forces to release a song called \u201cCheng.\u201d \u201cThe dark night is falling, but I will keep you company. The rain pours down heavy and hard, but cannot drown our dream,\u201d the lyrics go. \u201cLet us hold up the umbrella, never give in, never back down.\u201d\n\nThe situation is clearly uncomfortable for Beijing.\n\n[Protesters scatter after Hong Kong police deploy tear gas, water cannon ]\n\nAs if to show that \u201cOne country, two systems\u201d can work, the party plastered photos of Xi and the next chief executive of Macao, a special administrative Chinese region like Hong Kong, over the front page of its mouthpiece, the People\u2019s Daily.\n\nWhen Ho Iat Seng visited Beijing this month, Xi said Macao, which was handed back to China by Portugal two years after Hong Kong, showed that the principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d was \u201ccompletely feasible, and can be achieved and well received with people.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Ho emphasized the \u201cone country\u201d part of the formulation and said he would work to make sure the casino state became further integrated \u201cinto the nation\u2019s development.\u201d He encouraged young Macanese to work on the mainland.\n\nCommunist Party leaders have condemned the violence of some of the protests and accused Western countries of fomenting the unrest. But they have stopped short of direct action.\n\nThey have publicized military training on Hong Kong\u2019s borders and at the Hong Kong garrison of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which reports to the party. But apparently conscious of the international criticism that would follow military action and the effect on Hong Kong as a financial center, it has shown restraint.\n\nThe big question now is whether, after the spectacle of Oct. 1, Beijing will be less worried about the optics of action.\n\nRead more\n\nParamount and paranoid: China\u2019s Xi faces a crisis of confidence\n\nWith threats and propaganda, China tries to silence support for Hong Kong protests\n\nWill China crush Hong Kong protests?
