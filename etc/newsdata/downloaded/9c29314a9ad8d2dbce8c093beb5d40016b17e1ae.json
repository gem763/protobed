But as often happens, the fiercest debates take place between those with similar beliefs who disagree over how best to advance them.\n\nAhmari, a 34-year-old Iranian immigrant who converted to Catholicism three years ago, has adopted an apocalyptic approach to the culture war against secular liberalism. He wrote in May that \u201cprogressives understand that culture war means discrediting their opponents and weakening or destroying their institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cConservatives should approach the culture war with a similar realism. Civility and decency are secondary values,\u201d Ahmari wrote, and he wrote in that column that French\u2019s approach was a defeatist\u2019s strategy.\n\nFrench, a 50-year-old constitutional lawyer, a recipient of the Bronze Star for his military service in Iraq, and a fierce critic of President Trump, has argued that civility and free speech are central values to American flourishing and are in fact a part of Christian duty.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a sleepy affair. The debate between the two \u201cdiscussants,\u201d as Douthat called them, reached a fever pitch that ultimately led to a heated personal exchange.\n\nBut Ahmari was not an equal match for French. And so the most revealing moment came when Ahmari complained about conservatives who oppose Trump and claim that support for him damages the credibility of the Christian message.\n\n\u201cIn a certain kind of \u2018What about our Christian witness all the time,\u2019 behind it the unspoken assumption is we should take this because that\u2019s the path of martyrdom,\u201d Ahmari said.\n\nBy \u201ctake this,\u201d he was referring to the central question of the night, which was how Christians should respond to those who disagree with their views, and who in their view often try to bully, intimidate and coerce them into disavowing their beliefs on cultural issues.\n\nChristian martyrs facing hungry lions in the Colosseum in ancient Rome. (Photo: North Wind Picture Archives/Alamy Stock Photo) More\n\nAhmari talked about \u201cmartyrdom\u201d in the United States as if the execution of Christians for their religious beliefs was a real danger. \u201cNow there are people who are called to that, and they\u2019ll face it when it happens and they should,\u201d Ahmari said of martyrdom. \u201cAnd there are also religious people here \u2026 priests and so forth, who are called to this sort of heroic life. But we shouldn\u2019t want that for all Christians while we have political agency.\u201d\n\nAhmari referred to the practice in ancient Rome of Christians being led into the Colosseum to die at the hands of wild animals. \u201cWe should try to forestall the Colosseum. So that means not Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said.\n\nFrench was amused. \u201cDo you think Bernie Sanders would bring the Colosseum? He doesn\u2019t even have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell,\u201d French said, referring to the Republican Senate majority leader.", "description": "Would a President Bernie Sanders throw Christians to the lions?
