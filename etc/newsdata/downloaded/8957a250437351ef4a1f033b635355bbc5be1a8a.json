If you find you are often tired, you aren't getting enough.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHow to get to sleep\n\nIt's the question we all wish we had the magic answer to.\n\nA dark, quiet room with the fewest distractions possible are the ideal conditions to find before you try and nod off.\n\nHaving a set routine to prepare your body for sleep is also important, which includes no blue light from phones and other devices, as well as keeping a set bed time.\n\nFinding the right body temperature and avoiding caffeine should also help.\n\nIf none of these are working, Neil suggests trying sleeping apps or even seeing a GP if it's becoming a real problem.\n\nWhich sleep position is best?\n\nJust like knowing the right amount of sleep to get, the best sleeping position is individual to us all.\n\nThe most common with adults is the foetal position, on the side with the knees tucked, with 41% of adults drifting off this way.\n\nNeil says sleeping on your back is the 'ideal position' as it can reduce pressure on muscles and joints, as long as you don't have sleep apnoea or snoring issues.\n\nThe bad news for people who sleep on their front is that the position offers very little in the way of benefits.\n\nIf it's the only way you can get to sleep, it's advised you sleep with your head against a pillow facing forward so you have room to breathe, which reduces pressure on your neck.\n\nPregnant women are recommended to sleep in the foetal position to increase blood flow.", "description": "Sleep expert Neil Stanley reveals his secrets for getting more shut eye", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20067954.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Cant-sleep.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
