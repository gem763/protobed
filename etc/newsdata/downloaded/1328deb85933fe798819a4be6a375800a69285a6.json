REUTERS/Kham\n\nThousands of people respond to the lure of a better life abroad every year, but many take the underground route - via smugglers and sometimes dangerous journeys by sea and road.\n\nThat phenomenon is now in sharp focus after 39 bodies were discovered in a truck outside London last week.\n\nMany are feared to be Vietnamese from Nghe An and Ha Tinh, rice-growing areas in the northern-central part of the country.\n\nPoor job prospects, encouragement by authorities, smuggling gangs, environmental disaster and government pressure on Catholics are all local factors behind the wave of migrants.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone round here has a relative overseas,\u201d said Bui Thac, whose nephew Bui Phan Thang is feared to be among the container dead.\n\n\u201cAlmost all households have someone going abroad. Old people stay but young people must find ways to work abroad because it\u2019s difficult to work at home\u201d.\n\nImpoverished rural communities in Nghe An and Ha Tinh have been plunged into despair amid fears that missing loved ones are among those who died in the tragedy.\n\nLABOUR \u201cEXPORTS\u201d A PRIORITY\n\nFor Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist Party, the benefits of people legally moving abroad to work are clear.\n\nThe People\u2019s Committee of Nghe An issued a report on boosting labour exports this September.\n\n\u201cLabour exports are a priority for the Party and the state\u2019s socio-economic development programme to promote job creation, poverty reduction, career development and income generation for the People,\u201d the report on Decision No. 274/2009/NQ-HDND reads.\n\nGDP per capita in both provinces is lower than the national average of $2,540. Last year, people in Nghe An and Ha Tinh earned a total of $1,636 and $2,217 respectively.\n\nBut remittances from overseas help. Nghe An alone brought in $255 million a year, according to state media.\n\n\u201cLabour exports are one solution to unemployment,\u201d Nguyen Quang Phu, deputy chairman of Thanh Loc Commune, Can Loc district, told Reuters. \u201cRemittances have helped to improve the lives of the people here\u201d.\n\nDespite economic advantages, the tragedy has exposed the limits of the Communist Party\u2019s ability to govern how people are leaving.\n\nVibrant Catholic communities and people-trafficking gangs both pose headaches to the party, which rules from Hanoi some 300 km (180 miles) to the north.\n\nA toxic spill that poisoned fishing grounds three years ago is a further incentive to go abroad.\n\nGANGS\n\nAmong those who once set out from Nghe An to find work abroad was communist revolutionary and founding president, Ho Chi Minh.\n\nVietnam\u2019s first billionaire, Pham Nhat Vuong, went to the former Soviet Union in the 1990s before returning to build his Vingroup VIC.HM conglomerate. His roots are in Ha Tinh.\n\n\u201cPeople from these provinces have a long history of going overseas to earn money to send back home, especially during the time of the labour export programme to the former Soviet bloc countries,\u201d said Mimi Vu, an independent anti-trafficking advocate based in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\u201cAfter decades of this, the people believe that it\u2019s the only way to be successful and support the family with remittances,\u201d Vu said.\n\nThough impossible to quantify, local residents and people-trafficking experts believe many people leave with the help of smuggling gangs in Vietnam, who charge families thousands of dollars to get a relative overseas.\n\nPeople-smuggling to Britain has persisted for a long time, and London\u2019s National Crime Agency has posted a liaison officer to the British Embassy in Hanoi who helps combat the problem with Vietnamese police, along with handling other issues.\n\nIn an opinion piece published last month, Britain\u2019s Ambassador to Vietnam, Gareth Ward, warned of the dangers of believing promises made by the gangs.\n\n\u201cThey are not friends. They are criminals.\u201d\n\nPOISONED WATERS\n\nOpportunities for local employment have been hampered by environmental disaster.\n\nSandwiched between thin sandy beaches and herds of buffalo wallowing in rice paddies, the smoking chimneys of the Formosa Steel plant dominate this small corner of Ha Tinh province.\n\nThe steel mill, owned by Taiwan\u2019s Formosa Plastics, was blamed by Hanoi in 2016 for causing one of Vietnam\u2019s worst environmental disasters when a chemical leak poisoned coastal waters, unleashing widespread protests and damaging livelihoods.\n\n\u201cWe decided to let my husband work abroad in 2016 when the Formosa incident happened,\u201d said Anna Nguyen, whose husband left Vietnam and travelled illegally to Ukraine, France and then the UK to find work in a nail salon.\n\n\u201cWe were afraid that the contamination would harm our health and future so we took the risk. But now our life is so hard,\u201d she said.\n\nHa Tinh\u2019s state-run newspaper said last month that over 40,000 people leave the province annually for work elsewhere, including overseas.\n\nTHE PRIEST\n\nLike Anna Nguyen, many of those feared to have died in the container incident had Catholic names.\n\nNorthern-central Vietnam is dotted with clusters of small, Catholic communities, a hangover from France\u2019s conquest. Nghe An is home to 280,000 Catholics, according to state media and 149,000 live in Ha Tinh.\n\nAt a special ceremony held in the white-walled My Khanh Catholic church in Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, on Saturday night, father Anthony Dang Huu Nam blamed pollution, social difficulties and natural disasters such as floods and drought for the region\u2019s most recent migrant exodus.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nNam\u2019s outspoken sermons and criticism of Vietnam\u2019s government have earned both him and his church extra attention from the police, another factor encouraging some people to look for a new life elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWhy do so many Vietnamese people have to pay lots of money just to be dead?,\u201d Nam said during the ceremony.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that, even though Vietnam is not at war anymore, so many people are forced to leave for another land?\u201d", "description": "The countryside in the Vietnamese provinces of Nghe An and Ha Tinh is dotted with billboards for labour export companies advertising jobs or study overseas.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445891956&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R17T", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
