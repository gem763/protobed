So we asked an airline pilot how she takes care of herself.", "language": "en", "text": "When she\u2019s not flying four-day routes across the country, Jackson also volunteers on the board of the International Society of Women Airline Pilots, which supports and recruits female pilots; women make up only 6 percent of the worldwide pilot population, according to Women in Aviation International.\n\nJackson has flown for 21 years and worked as a flight instructor and regional pilot before joining American two years ago. \u201cPeople are entrusting their lives to us,\u201d she said. \u201cAs they walk onto my airplane, they\u2019re trusting that I got enough sleep, that I\u2019m healthy and eating right and I have the mental acuity and I\u2019ve done the preparation to safely get them from point A to point B so they can relax and watch a movie.\u201d Here\u2019s how she does that. This interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ: What do wellness and self-care mean to you?\n\nA: For me, it\u2019s a preferred lifestyle. It\u2019s not just a diet, an exercise set that I\u2019m into right now. It\u2019s all-encompassing, everything from what I\u2019m putting into my body to what I\u2019m spending my time doing when I\u2019m on the road.\n\nQ: Take me through your routine on days when you're flying, and not.\n\nA: My routine before I fly starts the day before, because I do meal prep. When you\u2019re gone for three or four days in a row, it\u2019s hard to eat healthy if you don\u2019t plan it out. The bag that I bring with me is half-tote and half-cooler. In the tote part is where I keep all the things that I need for flying, like my flight manuals, my work iPad, a safety vest. . . . In the cooler part is where I\u2019ll put my meals.\n\nAD\n\nI generally try to avoid eating meat; I\u2019m not a strict vegetarian, but it\u2019s actually a little bit easier to travel knowing that I don\u2019t have to keep anything really cold. I have a really amazing bean and corn salad that I make with a cilantro dressing. I make a tofu pad thai peanut meal that I eat with rice. I also keep a bag of raw almonds in my tote. It\u2019s a fantastic snack and a great way to get some energy.\n\nAD\n\nUsually I\u2019m up by about 6:15 a.m. If I have to work a late flight that night, I\u2019ll get the kids on the bus and come back and take a nap.\n\nThe hard thing about being a pilot is there\u2019s not always structure, so day-to-day, it\u2019s going to be different. There\u2019s variety, and you\u2019ve got to have flexibility while still finding time to make sure that you know you\u2019re staying healthy. I made a commitment to myself that every day I\u2019m home, I\u2019ll find time to work out. I usually try to make a 9:30 class at the gym, and then I run my errands. After my errands, I come home, and I\u2019m here for when the kids get off the bus. There\u2019s something just about every night, between baseball and basketball. All of my kids are musicians, too. We try to eat dinner together, and usually we make it work.\n\nAD\n\nQ: What do you do to relax when you're on the road?\n\nAD\n\nA: I do yoga in my room. I usually just lay the hotel towel on the floor and find a routine on YouTube. It\u2019s tempting to just get out of my uniform and veg the whole rest of the night, but just getting in a little bit of movement helps me feel better and brings things down for the day. The interesting thing about being a pilot is that you\u2019re using your brain a lot to fly an airplane. I\u2019ve found that if I don\u2019t find a way to physically exert some energy, I\u2019m tired from my day, but I\u2019m not physically tired. Sometimes I\u2019ll FaceTime my family depending on what time of day it is, or my husband if he\u2019s in another city.\n\nAnd I get caught up on emails \u2014 I do this when I\u2019m laying on the floor and I\u2019m doing leg lifts. When you are a parent and in aviation, sometimes it\u2019s like trying to conduct an orchestra from a thousand miles away. I\u2019m on the floor trying to get some physical exertion, and I\u2019m emailing a teacher back or one of my board members back. The nice thing about my husband being a pilot is sometimes I call him to unwind about my day, and he understands what I\u2019m saying. It goes back to having a support system. I chat with my best friends almost every day over text messages, or we send each other funny memes.\n\nAD\n\nQ: Do you get lonely when you're traveling? What do you do to combat that?\n\nAD\n\nA: It can be lonely to be traveling on the road for so many days in a row by yourself, away from your family. We [airline employees] all have that same understanding. We have this phrase, \u201cthe four-day family.\u201d We\u2019ll say, Hey let\u2019s meet downstairs at the hotel restaurant for dinner at 6. It\u2019s a nice little camaraderie type of thing.\n\nQ: What does your sleep schedule look like when you're on the road?\n\nA: I have different work schedules based on what time of day I\u2019m operating the aircraft. I always try to get a workout in. Having physical activity is imperative to getting a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nAD\n\nWhen I go to sleep, I always try to keep the temperature about the same as it is at home. I keep a water bottle next to me. Typically, I move the hotel air conditioning system\u2019s fan to the \u201con\u201d position, so there\u2019s a little bit of white noise in the room. If I get a hotel whose air system doesn\u2019t do that, I have a white-noise app.\n\nAD\n\nQ: How do you recover from jet lag and prevent getting sick?\n\nA: Even though I don\u2019t travel across a lot of time zones, I try to make sure that I\u2019m avoiding coffee late at night and staying hydrated so that I can go to sleep when I need to, to get my full eight hours before I fly the next day.\n\nNot getting sick is a concerted effort. I take a multivitamin every day. I avoid drinking a lot of pop. I\u2019m a firm believer of, if you put good things in your body and you take care of yourself, then you\u2019ll generally be a healthy person.\n\nAD\n\nQ: How do you keep your mind sharp?\n\nA: I think it all goes back to what I\u2019m putting in my body for overall health. Vitamin B really helps with mental acuity, so that\u2019s in the vitamin I take. I really try to stay healthy and balanced and get plenty of rest.\n\nI like to read when I\u2019m on my off time, and I play Words with Friends with a couple of friends on my phone. I actually just got a book called \u201cNerves of Steel,\u201d by Tammie Jo Shults [the captain who landed the severely damaged Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 last year]. I review my manuals every so often, too. Exercising your mind and doing those things helps keep your mind sharp. It\u2019s about using it just like any other muscle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ: What muscles are you working when you pilot a plane, and do you target those when you work out?\n\nA: It\u2019s probably mostly my arm muscles, and some core and my legs. Takeoff and landing are the most physical parts of flying the plane. Obviously you need arm muscles to rotate and pull back on the controls when you\u2019re taking off. When you\u2019re coming in to land, you\u2019re using your arm muscles, too. I have one hand on the thrust levers and the other hand on the yoke, and my feet are controlling the rudder to stay aligned with the runway if there\u2019s a crosswind. I still do an overall-body workout. The class I go to at home uses weights, so I\u2019m getting toning. I think keeping tone is important.\n\nQ: What does a really good day look like to you?\n\nAD\n\nA: The reason I got into the field I\u2019m in is because I love to fly airplanes \u2014 the exhilaration of being in the air and being in control of this magnificent, beautiful machinery and dealing with the airspace and the weather. A great day for me is being able to pass on my love of aviation to somebody in some way.\n\nMore from Lifestyle:", "description": "Erin Jackson, a 737 pilot for American Airlines, uses YouTube yoga workouts and packing healthy meals to stay well.", "authors": ["Helen Carefoot"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FGXB2oY_XTDTZYmMt0sJKMoVjJo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MPIEOZHXKYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
