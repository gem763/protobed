'Three for three boosters today for the Falcon Heavy.'\n\nThe megarocket took off in a cloud of smoke and fire at 6:35 p.m. (ET) carrying the high-capacity communications satellite, marking its first commercial mission.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket successfully took its second flight ever on Thursday afternoon, when it lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida carrying Lockheed Martin's Arabsat 6A communications satellite\n\nFALCON HEAVY: SPECS Height: 70 meters (229.6 feet) Stages: Two Boosters: Two Re-usable Cores: Three Engines: 27 Payload to LEO: 63,800kg (140,660 lb) Payload to Mars: 16,800kg (37,040 lb) Total width: 12.2m (39.9 ft) Mass: 1,420,788kg (3,125,735 lb) Total thrust at lift-off: 22,819 kilonewtons (5.13 million pounds)\n\n'Falcon Heavy is headed to space,' a SpaceX announcer confirmed on the livestream shortly after lift-off. 'Vehicle is supersonic.'\n\nIn a smooth launch and flight that lasted just a matter of minutes, Falcon Heavy successfully carried its first commercial payload to space.\n\nThe firm confirmed its accomplishment roughly 30 minutes after takeoff, revealing the Arabsat-6A satellite made it where it needed to go.\n\n'Successful deployment of Arabsat-6A to geosynchronous transfer orbit confirmed\u2014completing Falcon Heavy\u2019s first commercial mission!' SpaceX tweeted.\n\nSpaceX was forced to push back the Falcon Heavy launch several times due to uncooperative weather.\n\nA last-minute decision to delay it yet again on Wednesday night was made because of high upper-level winds and a poor forecast that made for unsafe launch conditions.\n\nBut, Elon Musk's rocket company confirmed in a tweet at 4:46 p.m. Thursday that 'all systems and weather are currently go,' for launch later that day.\n\nThe two side boosters can be seen during their synchronized descent to the landing pads back on Earth after the successful launch\n\nThe giant rocket's central core landed safely on SpaceX's offshore barge in the Atlantic Ocean, dubbed 'Of Course I Still Love You,' while the two side boosters landed back on pads at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Landing Zone 1 and 2\n\nIt\u2019s been fourteen months since Falcon Heavy's maiden launch, when it blasted off to become the most powerful rocket in use today.\n\nThe latest launch marked the first time Falcon Heavy flies using the new Block 5 hardware, which is designed to last longer than previous versions without the need for refurbishment.\n\nBecause of this, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk said they were being \u2018extra cautious,\u2019 and previously noted that the schedule could shift.\n\nAfter its first launch last February, SpaceX managed to successfully land the two side boosters back on Earth in a remarkable, synchronized feat.\n\nFalcon Heavy rocket is headed back to space for the second time after a successful liftoff from Kennedy Space Center.

It carried a red Tesla Roadster with a dummy in the driver's seat\n\nBut this time around, all went according to plan.\n\nThe current iteration of Falcon Heavy is even more powerful than the first, with a maximum thrust of 2,550 tons, according to Musk \u2013 or about 10 percent higher than last year\u2019s demo.\n\nFalcon Heavy launched for the first time last year, on February 6 following roughly five years of setbacks.\n\nThe rocket boasts three reusable cores, each containing nine Merlin engines for a whopping total of 27.\n\nThis gave it a total thrust of 2,500 tons \u2013 or the equivalent of 18 Boeing 747 aircraft at full throttle.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t more powerful than NASA\u2019s Saturn V rocket, which took its last flight in 1973, SpaceX\u2019s heavy-lift rocket is the most powerful currently in operation.", "description": "SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket successfully took its second flight ever on Thursday afternoon, when it lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center  carrying Lockheed Martin's Arabsat 6A satellite.", "authors": ["Annie Palmer", "Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/12/00/12170874-0-image-a-22_1555024000735.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-11"}
