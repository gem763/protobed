Its qualities are subjective, often intangible and niche, though we all know one when we see it. Think Mervyn Peake\u2019s quirkily gothic Gormenghast novels or The Bloody Chamber, Angela Carter\u2019s seminal reworked fairy tales. Think Doris Lessing\u2019s radical showstopper, The Golden Notebook, or The Dice Man by Luke Rhinehart, a countercultural yarn still spoken of in rapt tones by its acolytes.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Book review: The Testaments\n\n- The best books of the year so far\n\n- Is failure the new literary success?\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that the cult classic inspires passionate devotion among its fans, who frequently weave their own myths around the texts. But another, under-examined, feature of the cult book is this: in contrast to the examples above, it can sometimes age really badly. Every bit as badly as giant shoulder pads, velour tracksuits and platform hiking boots.\n\nWe\u2019ve taken a blushing look back at some of the formerly hip tomes now shelved in that spectral section of the bookshop reserved for the irredeemably dated, the hopelessly irrelevant, the plain offensive. Their fate tells us a little something not only about why cult novels fade but also about how they\u2019re made in the first place.\n\nHalf a century later, On The Road exudes tiresome stoner machismo\n\nIf there\u2019s one lesson to be learned, it\u2019s this: stay sceptical, dear reader. Don\u2019t, for instance, rush to empty your home of anything that doesn\u2019t \u2018spark joy\u2019 at the behest of a book that may yet turn out to be our own era\u2019s Jonathan Livingston Seagull. (Then again, if you do still have a copy of that particular avian-inspired title lurking in your bookcase, now might be a good time to pay a visit to the charity shop. Just saying\u2026)\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger, 1951\n\nPoor Holden Caulfield. Mired in a funk for more than half a century, the angst-ridden \u2018everyteen\u2019 is now regarded by the cool kids as being a bit \u2013 well, self-indulgent. His ennui is, if not exclusively a rich-white-dude problem, then certainly nothing compared with looming climate collapse and other woes weighing on the minds of his 21st-Century peers. Plus, in the era of helicopter parenting and geo-tagging, not to mention hyper-vigilant mental-health awareness, the idea that a depressed teen could simply go AWOL in New York City for a couple of days is increasingly hard to indulge.\n\nAtlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, 1957\n\nAs a philosopher, Rand gave the world Objectivism, idealising laissez-faire capitalism and the pursuit of self-interest. Accordingly, her novel tells the 1,200-page story of a dystopian US, buckling beneath burdensome rules and regulations. Mauled by critics, it became a word-of-mouth bestseller thanks in part to superfan Nathaniel Branden, who proved his allegiance by memorising her earlier work, The Fountainhead \u2013 all 750 pages of it. But adoration can be a mixed blessing: while Atlas is still revered by libertarians and political conservatives, the nature of its latter-day fans \u2013 a host of President Trump\u2019s associates among them \u2013 has helped alienate a new generation.\n\nThe Beach by Alex Garland, 1996\n\nYou likely had to be there to even begin to get how The Beach exerted such a hold over its readers. \u2018There\u2019 being not its exotic location \u2013 an idyllic island off Bangkok \u2013 but the 1990s, when rave culture ruled. It was a moment ripe for this amphetamine-fuelled, hallucinogenic novel whose disaffected narrator has been given directions to a supposedly pristine Utopia. Here\u2019s the catch: Richard is searching for a truly authentic experience, something that few even pretend to want any longer, preferring instead to enquire about what filter\u2019s been used. Plus, who\u2019d know what to do with a hand-drawn map these days?\n\nIron John by Robert Bly, 1990\n\nA consciousness-raising polemic based on a German folk tale, this is the book that inspired a generation of middle-aged men to braid leaf crowns and circle dance bare-chested in the woods. As with so many books on this list, its flaws have been magnified by the passage of time. Utterly devoid of irony and blinkered by his orientation as a straight white bloke, its lute-strumming (oh yes) author is just too easy to send up. And then there are the honking great phallocentric metaphors that he just can\u2019t let go of\u2026 We may well need to redefine masculinity, but re-wilding doesn\u2019t seem the optimal way of going about it.\n\nThe Outsider by Colin Wilson, 1956\n\nIn its heyday, every Angry Young Man was paging through this rambling study of the outsider in Western literature. Written by a 24-year-old with apparently neither formal education nor a home (he was living rough on London\u2019s Hampstead Heath), it won glowing reviews. Then, just two years later, Wilson\u2019s second novel was so comprehensively panned that The Outsider was re-evaluated and found badly lacking. Not that it inhibited Wilson, who went on to write more than 100 further books, comparing himself to Nietzsche, and accusing Shakespeare of having a mind \u201clike a female novelist\u201d. And nope, he did not mean that as a compliment.\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway, 1952\n\nHemingway\u2019s supposed masterpiece of a novella describes a luckless old fisherman who sets sail on a solo fishing expedition and finds himself in a three-day tussle with a gigantic marlin. Lacking the complex plots and satisfying character arcs of his better work, its wisdom includes pearls such as \u201cpain does not matter to a man\u201d. There are alternative readings of this text but so long as \u2018Papa\u2019s\u2019 persona as a bullfighting brawler retains its power, it will remain a paean to faltering virility that\u2019s likely to put readers off his entire oeuvre.\n\nOn the Road by Jack Kerouac, 1957\n\nBased on a road trip from New York to Mexico with Beat muse Neal Cassady, Kerouac wrote what would become the Beatnik\u2019s bible in just three weeks. It took six years to get published and more than half a century later, it exudes tiresome stoner machismo. Kerouac pokes fun at gays, and isn\u2019t much better where women and blacks are concerned. A few years back, a spate of books and films inspired only a flicker of revived interest in his legacy. Boorish egotist or inspired prophet? The jury isn\u2019t just out, it left the building long ago, dancing after the hippies who supplanted the Beats.\n\nThe Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider, 1995\n\nMen have The Game; women have The Rules, a manipulative, oddly heartless bestseller whose slavish followers (they\u2019re said to include Blake Lively) were gluttons for dictums like don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t have curly hair, don\u2019t even think of returning that call. Never mind the feminist critiques \u2013 its opinion of men is so low you\u2019re left wondering why any of us would want to land such a catch in the first place. In 2013, the book was up-dated for the era of internet dating and sexting, but it still seems positively Victorian in the context of a cultural marker like Lena Dunham\u2019s Girls.\n\nJonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, 1970\n\nSo, yes, Jonathan Livingston Seagull really is a seagull, but he\u2019s a seagull with aspirations, a non-conformist who yearns to soar above the flock and up into the heavens, just as the book itself conquered the bestseller charts back in the day. Its saccharine idealism isn\u2019t made any more palatable by learning that Richard Nixon\u2019s FBI director, L Patrick Gray, ordered all his staff to read it, and a 1973 movie adaptation, complete with Neil Diamond soundtrack, did it no favours either. Film critic Roger Ebert summed it up: \u201cThis has got to be the biggest pseudocultural, would-be metaphysical rip-off of the year\u201d.\n\nLittle Red Book by Mao Zedong, 1964\n\nDuring China\u2019s Cultural Revolution it was essential to own and carry one of these pocket-sized volumes of Chairman Mao\u2019s aphorisms, making it second only to the Bible in terms of copies printed. It was also adopted by Western hippies, becoming a must-have accessory for every blissed-out fellow traveller, but it\u2019s suffered doubly in the decades since. For a start, there\u2019s the matter of Mao\u2019s involvement in torture, mass killings and the devastating famine that resulted from his Great Leap Forward. Then there are the rumours \u2013 denied by Beijing \u2013 that the dictator might have had some help from ghost writers.\n\nInfinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, 1996\n\nThe story of a reformed addict who navigates enormous personal trauma without falling off the wagon, this novel\u2019s fate is a melancholy example of how writers can become victims of their own cultdom. Since his suicide in 2010, DFW\u2019s fans have canonised him. The hero worship has rendered books like Infinite Jest \u2013 whose physical heft makes it big enough to be used as a weapon \u2013 symbols of \u2018bro-lit\u2019. It also made stories about his abusive treatment of women harder to hear. This may still be a cult read among a certain type of young dude, but female readers have by and large dropped it like a sweaty jockstrap.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
