He has promised to force a vote this week on various Trump Administration directives that have injected flexibility into Obamacare. As The Hill reports, \u201cSenate Democrats plan to force vulnerable Republicans to vote on legislation that would overturn a controversial Trump administration directive on ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nThe idea is that Democrats can force besieged lawmakers such as Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Martha McSally (R-Arizona) to take a stand and make an unpopular vote on the issue that voters consistently identify as the most important: health care.\n\nBut just like that impeachment fracas taking place in the Romper Room, this ploy on healthcare threatens to recoil badly on Democrats.\n\nRemember \u201cif you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan\u201d? That was the rubric under which President Obama sold the American public the bill of goods we now know as Obamacare. Even Politifact called it the lie of the year. He promised premiums would go down. In fact, they have skyrocketed. Thanks to Obama, when it comes to health care, people have fewer choices, pay more, and have to wait longer to receive treatment, which is increasingly rationed by the bureaucrats in Washington.\n\nA Cynical Exercise\n\nNo issue is more important to American voters than health care. No issue has brought out more forcefully the authoritarian, top-down instincts of Democrats. As Ronald Reagan noted way back in 1961, \u201cOne of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine.\u201d Indeed. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy,\u201d Reagan pointed out, \u201cto disguise a medical program as a humanitarian project. Most people are a little reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people who possibly can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nObamacare was a cynical exercise in the opposite: disguising a so-called humanitarian project as a medical program.\n\nOne of the chief architects of that misbegotten initiative, Jonathan Gruber, later admitted that he deliberately misled the American people about the true costs of Obamacare, adding that the deception wasn\u2019t difficult because of \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\nJust how stupid are we? Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has made abolishing private health care insurance a centerpiece of her campaign. Some other Democratic presidential candidates, with greater or lesser candor, have followed suit. This would tip health care even further into the clutches of the busy bureaucrats who want to run your life and tell what you may and may not do. Is there more powerful vote-losing platform?\n\nImpeaching the president because he committed the sin of having been elected without the permission of Democrats is right up there, but pushing the U.S. healthcare system further into the one-size-fits-all template of wannabe socialists will give it stiff competition.\n\nNipping Reform in the Bud\n\nDonald Trump tried to get rid of Obamacare soon after taking office. The late and wretched John McCain (R-Ariz.), petulant narcissist par excellence, cast the deciding vote against Trump\u2019s initiative, scoring a grubby point against Trump while also kicking his party and the American people in the teeth.\n\nIn the months that followed, Trump endeavored to open up Obamacare and repeal some of its more onerous requirements. Among other things, he brought some creative thinking to the so-called \u201c1332 waivers,\u201d which allowed individual states to apply to opt-out of some of Obamacare\u2019s provisions. This is what The Hill called \u201ccontroversial.\u201d The Obama Administration imposed stringent requirements on such waivers, with the result that only four states qualified. The Trump Administration has loosened those requirements, with the result that, to date, 13 states have been able to take advantage of the waivers and consequently reduce premiums while increasing patient choice.\n\nSchumer aims to nip that initiative in the bud and stymie efforts to turn health care back to the states and local authorities. The more voters know about Schumer\u2019s initiative and his heavy-handed efforts to push the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic party, the more vigorously they will reject it.\n\nWhich is why the people who should be worried are not lawmakers like Collins and McSally, but vulnerable Senate Democrats like Gary Peters in Michigan, Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, Tina Smith in Minnesota, Mark Warner in Virginia, and Doug Jones in Alabama.\n\nSchumer and his leftist colleagues want to eliminate private health insurance and turn over health care to government bureaucrats in Washington. The goal is not better or more affordable healthcare but more control over the lives of the people whom they regard as their wards.\n\nTheir agenda is an agenda of dependency. Attacking Trump\u2019s efforts to open up and improve upon Obamacare is a step in that direction. Voters in 2020 will remember who voted for this tool to further enslave the American people. They will not look kindly upon it.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RogerK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
