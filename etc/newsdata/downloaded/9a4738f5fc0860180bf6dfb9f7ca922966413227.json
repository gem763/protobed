I guess it\u2019s anxiety and pressure of life ... and when I actually reached out to someone they said I was draining. I feel like this is why some people keep their emotions to themselves.\n\n'I certainly hate talking about my feelings. And being a burden is my biggest fear.... I\u2019m lucky to be able to pick myself up when things feel s**t. But what happens if someone can\u2019t . Be nice to people. You never know what\u2019s going on .
