She was woken up by pack pain, for which she took ibuprofen.\n\nBut when pins and needles struck and her legs began to feel numb over the next hour, she suspected something was very wrong.\n\nMs Langley alerted her boyfriend, Tom, and was rushed to hospital where an MRI scan showed a worrying mass on her spine.\n\nIt was later revealed to be a haematoma, or blood clot - which caused a spinal cord injury, leaving her paralysed from the waist down.\n\nDoctors determined the blood clot must have formed very quickly, given how rapidly the bookkeeper became ill. But they still do not know why it happened.\n\nShe has been given a two per cent chance of walking again and will likely need round-the-clock care for the rest of her life, but is determined to stay independent.\n\nThe couple had just bought their dream house in Newark, Nottinghamshire, before Ms Langley's ordeal. They are now raising funds to renovate to accommodate her needs.\n\nOlivia Langley, 27, had just bought her dream home with her boyfriend, Tom, in Newark, Nottinghamshire, before she suddenly was paralysed from the waist down\n\nAt hospital, it was revealed Ms Langley had a haematoma, or blood clot, on her spine, which caused a spinal cord injury, leaving her paralysed from the waist down\n\nMs Langley was raced to theatre to have a four-hour operation, which saw surgeons 'drill' into her spine to remove the mass. She is pictured in hospital\n\nMs Langley said: 'I went to the gym five times a week, looked after myself and had loads of outdoorsy hobbies. This just goes to show that it can happen to anybody.\n\n'Nobody knows what will happen next, or whether or not I will walk again. The main thing for me is to keep my independence.\n\n'This has been so hard on my family and Tom. You never think at 26 you'll be dealing with your girlfriend becoming paralysed overnight.\n\n'Sometimes I feel like I've ruined his life, but he has been there, carrying on beside me \u2013 and that's more than I could ever ask for.'\n\nShe added: 'This has all been so incredibly shocking. People often think a spinal cord injury happens after a fall or some trauma \u2013 but they can affect anybody. I had no signs or symptoms at all until that night.'\n\nMs Langley was preparing to sit accountancy exams and progress in her career before her ordeal began that night in August.\n\nMs Langley said: 'I went to the gym five times a week, looked after myself and had loads of outdoorsy hobbies. This just goes to show that it can happen to anybody'\n\nMs Langley woke up with back pain, for which she took ibuprofen. But when pins and needles struck and her legs began to feel numb, she suspected something was very wrong. She is pictured in hospital\n\nDoctors determined the blood clot which must have formed very quickly, given how rapidly Ms Langley, pictured with her parents, fell ill. But they still do not know why it happened\n\nWHAT IS A SPINAL HAEMATOMA? A spinal haematoma is a collection of blood that compresses the spinal cord and nerve roots. Significant compression of the spinal cord can result in irreversible neurological damage. Symptoms may include pain, weakness, numbness, difficulty walking, loss of bowel and/or bladder control, or paralysis. Without treatment, permanent loss of neurological function or paralysis may occur. Anything that results in haemorrhage around the spinal cord may produce a spinal haematoma.

There was no reason to suspect what was coming.\n\n'As a teenager, I'd had a few back problems like muscle spasms, so I assumed it was that.\n\n'I took some ibuprofen and got Tom to hold some frozen peas against my back. But over the next hour or so, the pain got worse, and I got pins and needles in my legs before they went numb.\n\n'I knew then that something really wasn't right.'\n\nAfter phoning 999, Ms Langley was taken to King's Mill Hospital, in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, by ambulance. An MRI scan revealed a mass was restricting blood flow to her spinal cord.\n\nShe said: 'I was in so much shock over how I'd been fine just a few hours before, and it was all happening so quickly that I didn't have time to really process it.\n\n'I wasn't in the frame of mind to fathom it. It was terrifying, but I just went along with what doctors were telling me.'\n\nMs Langley was transferred to the more specialist Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham, where she was raced down to theatre.\n\nSurgeons 'drilled' into her spine to remove the mass in an emergency four-hour operation on August 22.\n\n'The focus at first was just getting rid of the haematoma before it got any worse,' said Ms Langley.\n\nThe couple, who have been together for two years, found a property - a new-build three bed - in summer 2019. But before they could move in, Ms Langley was in hospital\n\nMs Langley had a four-hour operation which saw surgeons 'drill' into her spine to remove the mass. But sadly the damage had been done and she was left paraplegic. She is pictured in hospital in a wheelchair with Tom\n\n'Paralysis had been on my mind as, when I arrived at hospital, I'd been unable to feel my legs. But I thought that the feeling would come back after my surgery.\n\n'It was only when I came round and a doctor came to see me that it dawned on me it might not.'\n\nFollowing her operation, doctors told Ms Langley that she had sustained a serious spinal cord injury.\n\nBetween 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury every year across the world.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 Britons and 290,000 Americans are living with a spinal cord injury.\n\nIt has left Ms Langley paraplegic - the lower half of her body is paralysed.\n\nFor the next six weeks, Ms Langley remained in QMC, recovering and building up her strength before being transferred once again.\n\nThis time she went to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital in South Yorkshire for rehabilitation, where she remains today.\n\n'There's still no set answer about my paraplegia and whether I will ever walk again,' she said. 'Spinal cord injuries are very complex, and every case is different.\n\n'At my last appointment, I was told that, although doctors are really pleased with the progress I am making in physiotherapy, I am working with a one to two per cent chance of walking again right now.\n\n'It's all those little things people take for granted and don't even think of that have been the hardest.\n\n'For example, my stomach muscles have gone so I can't hold myself up without leaning on somebody.'\n\nOn the rehabilitation ward, Ms Langley's days are made up of a timetable of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and optional extras like hydrotherapy.\n\nShe said: 'As soon as I was able to do so, I signed up to do some sports. It's helped get me active again, and also meet some people going through the same thing.\n\nMs Langley said: 'There's still no set answer about my paraplegia and whether I will ever walk again. Spinal cord injuries are very complex, and every case is different'\n\nBecause Ms Langley is paralysed from the waist down, her stomach muscles are also unable to support her. On the rehabilitation ward, her days are made up of a timetable of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and optional extras like hydrotherapy. She is pictured in a wheelchair\n\nMs Langley is determined to stay independent, with her new home being adapted for her needs. She hopes to one day drive again in a special car and have children, but it is not clear if she will ever walk again. She is pictured on an outing from hospital\n\n'Although I haven't been able to meet many other young women, which has been hard.\n\n'It does give me hope to see people coming out the other side of a spinal cord injury and rebuilding their lives, but it would help to talk to other young women like me.'\n\nOne particularly challenging part of Ms Langley's ordeal has been the thought that it may potentially affect her chances of having children \u2013 something she had always dreamed of.\n\nFertility and sexual function may be affected by a spinal cord injury, but it is not clear if this is the case for Ms Langley.\n\nShe said: 'I very much envisaged being a mum, but that's now a long way in the future.\n\n'I have to get myself back to where I want to be, and feel able to look after myself before I can think about looking after a child.\n\n'Plus when that day comes, I will likely need carers to help me, which is something I find difficult as independence is so important to me.'\n\nMs Langley has a provisional discharge date of December 3, which doctors are confident she will meet \u2013 meaning she will be home for Christmas.\n\nHer plan once she leaves hospital is to live with her parents while the home she bought with Tom - a new-build three bed - is being adapted to cater for her new needs.\n\nHer best friend Rosie Bown set up a GoFundMe page to help with the cost of the alterations, equipment, such as a lightweight wheelchair and standing frame, and ongoing physiotherapy.\n\nAlready, more than \u00a34,000 has been donated, and her loved ones have also planned a string of fundraising events.\n\nMs Langley said of Tom: 'Sometimes I feel like I've ruined his life, but he has been there, carrying on beside me \u2013 and that's more than I could ever ask for'\n\n'This has turned everybody's lives upside down, not just mine, but my loved ones have been my rock.'\n\nOnce home, Ms Langley has vowed to grow as strong as possible in the hope that she will one day be able to enjoy the hobbies she once loved, like the gym or exploring the countryside.\n\nShe added: 'While nobody can say for sure what will happen in the future, I believe you get out what you put in, so I am doing everything I can to work hard and get strong.\n\n'I'm determined to keep my independence, even if that means doing things differently. For example, I want to drive again, so have a plan to get a specially adapted car.\n\n'It's really important to have goals \u2013 however small they may seem \u2013 to get through.\n\n'I can't wait to be in the home Tom and I bought together. When I envisaged moving in to my first house with him, it wasn't like this at all.\n\n'I just want to work as hard as I can to get home in time for Christmas.'\n\nTo donate to Ms Langley's page, visit here.", "description": "Olivia Langley, 27, of Newark, woke up with back pain and numbness in her legs.
