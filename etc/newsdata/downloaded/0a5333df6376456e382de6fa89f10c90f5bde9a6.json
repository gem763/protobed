(Jonathan Bachman/Reuters)\n\nThere is no good reason for a faithful conservative to support this man.\n\nPartisan politics does strange things to human minds. I continue to see Twitter, Facebook, and my email inbox light up with the most bizarre comparisons. Roy Moore is like Martin Luther King Jr. Moore is like General George S. Patton. Moore is like Thomas Jefferson. In other words, Americans have a long history of tolerating sexual indiscretions for the sake of larger and more important causes. Great men can have feet of clay and still be great men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere does exist a fascinating moral question, here: To what extent should we honor undeniably brilliant and important men even after we learn of their profound moral failures? The short answer is that we can certainly honor their accomplishments while still recognizing and condemning their failures. The Declaration of Independence is one of the great documents in world history, yet that doesn\u2019t make Jefferson\u2019s reported treatment of his slaves acceptable or tolerable.\n\nBut the question of how we remember men like Patton, Jefferson, and King \u2014 men whose greatness was known well before many of their sins were disclosed \u2014 is completely separate from the question of the day. That question is not whether the people of Alabama should vote for a great man with a serious flaw, but whether the people of Alabama should vote for a terrible man who lacks any redeeming virtue. In fact, Moore is so terrible that the most likely outcome of his elevation to the Senate is direct and important harm to the causes most Alabama Republicans claim to support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Americans learned one single thing about Moore\u2019s alleged mistreatment and sexual assault of young girls, they had more than enough information to know that he was unfit for higher office. This was no mystery. He\u2019d been tossed from office twice before, and his record of vicious constitutional ignorance was well known.\n\nLet\u2019s review the facts:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoore believes he\u2019s a law unto himself. For those unfamiliar with Moore\u2019s history, let\u2019s take a quick walk down memory lane. He\u2019s been removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice. The first time, in 2003, he defied a federal court order requiring him to remove a granite Ten Commandments monument \u2014 a monument he\u2019d commissioned \u2014 from the Alabama Supreme Court building. The second time, he was suspended without pay after issuing an order to Alabama probate judges declaring that they had a \u201cministerial duty\u201d not to issue same-sex marriage licenses. He issued this order six months after the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in Obergefell v. Hodges, that the Constitution protected a right to same-sex marriage.\n\nThere are multiple ways to lawfully protest federal court orders. There are even lawful ways to change or reverse odious Supreme Court precedents. But the very instant that we permit any judge to actively defy the constitutional order simply when he \u2014 in his subjective wisdom \u2014 believes a superior court has overstepped its bounds is the instant we begin to lose the rule of law.\n\nIronically enough, those who support Moore because they hate \u201cjudicial supremacy\u201d are endorsing the most dangerous form of judicial supremacy possible: a judge who actively defies controlling authority on the basis of his will alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Moore\u2019s defenders not realize the extent to which religious freedom in this nation depends on a host of progressive judges and government officials complying with lawful court orders? For example, the ability to hire and fire pastors according to the dictates of the church and not the federal government was only recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. What if some state judge, somewhere, disagrees? If you accept Moore\u2019s behavior on the bench, you must accept that any judge can defy the Supreme Court whenever he sees fit.\n\nI spent most of my career securing court order after court order protecting the most basic religious-freedom rights for people of faith in the most hostile of environments \u2014 places, for example, where government officials believe that Christian student groups are no better than the Klan. I suppose, following the Moore precedent, those officials should be celebrated and promoted if they defied court rulings they despised.\n\nI remember Moore\u2019s first expulsion vividly. I remember Christian talking heads celebrating his grandstanding even as the most serious and most effective Christian lawyers were quietly (too quietly, it turns out) disgusted. With so many critical cases pending in court, were Christians sending a message that the rule of law applied only to our opponents?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, Moore\u2019s actions as chief justice were so brazen and so egregious that they should disqualify him from the Senate on their own. Yet they don\u2019t even come close to constituting the totality of his sins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoore is a vicious constitutional and historical illiterate. One could write thousands of words on Roy Moore\u2019s countless stupid and vile statements. Let\u2019s consider only a few. For a man who professes to be a student of the Constitution, he\u2019d happily violate its express terms. In a 2006 op-ed, he wrote that Muslim representative Keith Ellison \u201ccannot swear an oath on the Quran and an allegiance to our Constitution at the same time.\u201d Article VI of the Constitution directly, unequivocally, and unambiguously says otherwise. It prohibits any \u201creligious test\u201d as a \u201cQualification to any Officer or public Trust under the United States.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, this is a man who\u2019s built his entire public personae around the false idea that he\u2019s a guardian of the original meaning of the Constitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoving on from Moore\u2019s broken conception of the law, let\u2019s look at his understanding of history. In September, a man asked him when he thought America was great. \u201cI think it was great at the time when families were united \u2014 even though we had slavery \u2014 they cared for one another,\u201d he responded. \u201cOur families were strong, our country had a direction.\u201d\n\nThis is bizarre. In the antebellum South, black families were ripped apart constantly and intentionally. Husbands, wives, sons, and daughters were bought and sold, as Clint Smith pointed out on Twitter:\n\nI *really* think people need to understand how ahistorical & morally egregious Roy Moore\u2019s comments were when he said, \u201cI think it was great at the time when families were united \u2014 even though we had slavery.\u201d This is what slavery did to black families: pic.twitter.com/JNUM4DPrwE \u2014 Clint Smith (@ClintSmithIII) December 10, 2017\n\nMoore is, however, right that the \u201ccountry had a direction\u201d in those days; it was marching directly to civil war.\n\nWhen conservatives argue that Moore will be a walking campaign commercial for Democrats, it\u2019s comments like this that come to mind. And they\u2019re just the tip of the iceberg. He\u2019s a birther; he\u2019s said it \u201cwould eliminate many problems\u201d if our nation passed a constitutional amendment revoking all amendments after the Tenth, a list that includes amendments prohibiting slavery, guaranteeing the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d of citizens and the equal protection of the law, and granting women the right to vote.\n\nPeople of Alabama, is this the champion you want in the Senate? Is this the man you want representing your interests and allegedly defending your values?\n\nMoore is absolutely, positively obsessed with gay people. There\u2019s an old slander of Christian conservatives. Sexual revolutionaries relentlessly attempt to change sexual mores, and when they encounter resistance, they cry out, \u201cWhy are you obsessed with sex?\u201d Feminists view the right to abortion as sacred yet mock conservative \u201csingle-issue voting.\u201d Social-justice warriors are so consumed with ensuring sexual liberty that they\u2019ll attempt to purge even from private workplaces men or women whose sole sin is opposing same-sex marriage. Sex is their obsession, not conservatives\u2019. There is nothing obsessive about or wrong with defending religious freedom and free speech from sexual revolutionaries.\n\nBut then there\u2019s Roy Moore. He is the stereotype. \u201cYou could say\u201d America is the \u201cfocus of evil in the modern world,\u201d Moore opined earlier this year. The reason? \u201cWe promote a lot of bad things\u201d like \u201csame-sex marriage.\u201d\n\nVideo: Roy Moore: Putin may be right, America is the focus of modern evil in the world. pic.twitter.com/fOUZfygEgm \u2014 The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) December 8, 2017\n\nLast month, he refused to debate his Democratic opponent. The reason? \u201c\u201dWe\u2019ve refused to debate them because of their very liberal stance on transgenderism and transgenderism in the military and in bathrooms.\u201d\n\nAlso last month, he identified the \u201cthey\u201d he believes are behind the multiple, corroborated claims of sexual misconduct lodged against him. Surprise, surprise, look who\u2019s on the list:\n\n\u201cWhen I say \u2018they,\u2019 who are they?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re liberals; they don\u2019t hold conservative values. They\u2019re the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered who want to change our culture. They\u2019re socialists who want to change our way of life.\u201d\n\nThe pattern is clear: When Moore is angry, feels cornered, or wants a scapegoat for his own political troubles, he lashes out at LGBT Americans without any sense of proportion or regard for the truth.\n\nAnd, of course . . .\n\nYes, Moore is a likely sex abuser. The fact remains that multiple women have come forward offering corroborated stories that as a 30-something prosecutor, Moore dated teenage girls. In two instances, one of them involving a 14-year-old girl, he is credibly accused of grotesque misconduct. Moore\u2019s defenders have spun conspiracy theories (for example, that the Washington Post paid women to come forward), issued inconsistent stories (at one point Moore admitted knowing some of the women; now he says he didn\u2019t know any of them), and spread their own \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nYes, to no one\u2019s surprise, Gloria Allred\u2019s extraordinary incompetence helped complicate one accuser\u2019s story, but the fact remains that now two women have come forward with remarkably similar inscriptions from Roy Moore that appear to date back to their teen years. Other evidence \u2014 like court dates, contemporaneous, corroborating witnesses, and widespread knowledge of Moore\u2019s dating habits \u2014 bolsters the stories of Moore\u2019s multiple accusers. Simply put, the evidence is so strong that no meaningful number of Republicans would give Moore the benefit of the doubt if he were a Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoore will hurt the pro-life cause. Given everything outlined above, it\u2019s hard to imagine a worse ambassador for the cause of life than Roy Moore. The battle to end abortion is every bit as much cultural as it is political or judicial. For the sake of electing a single junior senator (a man who\u2019s not even a swing vote) to serve one-half of a Senate term, pro-life Republicans would make it more likely that Republicans lose the upper chamber in 2018. In 2012, the Left hung Todd Akin around Republican necks like a millstone. Moore makes Akin look like a gentleman and a scholar.\n\nThe GOP will enjoy its majority in the short term with or without Moore. It will confirm judges between now and 2018 with or without Moore. It cannot, however, continue to drift toward vile, malicious ignorance and hope to remain the majority party. Moore won\u2019t overturn Roe, but he will continually embarrass its pro-life opponents.\n\nThe choice isn\u2019t binary. Anyone who tells you that your choice is limited to pro-abortion Doug Jones or an incompetent, unfit apparent child abuser like Roy Moore is simply lying to you. If you are a faithful conservative, you can write in a different name or stay home. You can reject the choice served up by the plurality of Alabama GOP primary voters and simply say, \u201cIf you want my vote, you have to do better.\u201d\n\nDoing so would send a message to both parties. Democrats can\u2019t win over voters with their own warped version of the \u201clesser evil.\u201d The Democratic party knows full well that Alabama has an overwhelming pro-life majority, but its progressive core is so committed to abortion rights that it won\u2019t move one inch \u2014 and then it sits back and condemns GOP voters for holding true to their most important principles. You can\u2019t refuse to compromise and then condemn your opponent for inflexibility.\n\nThere is no comparison between Moore and men like Patton, Jefferson, and King. Their legacies are complicated by their flaws. Moore\u2019s candidacy is unambiguous. There is no positive political legacy to \u201ccomplicate.\u201d There is only a sordid, ignorant, and revolting reality.\n\nNo party or politician is entitled to your vote. Every man or woman who seeks public office has to earn the public\u2019s trust.
