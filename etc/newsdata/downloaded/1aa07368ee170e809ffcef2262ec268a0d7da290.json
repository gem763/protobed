Her critiques of culture, art, and society have garnered a lot of attention from friends and foes alike. Love her or hate her, when Camille Paglia speaks, the world listens. As it should. She is a writer of enormous intellect, who has a feel for the nuances and intricacies of how being human works. She is a great synthesizer of the large and great ideas upon which civilizations were built and crumbled, and her views on gender, sexuality, and art are delivered with a verve and speed only a few can match.\n\nPaglia\u2019s new book, Provocations, is a collection of essays written over the course of the last 20 years. As one might expect, the essays cover a multitude of topics: feminism, politics, gender, higher education, film, and art. In many ways, Paglia has continued the approach of analysis and synthesis of ideas she did in Sexual Personae. She has the ability to take a large idea that encompasses one civilization in history and show us that those signs never left us.\n\nPaglia certainly did this in Sexual Personae, in which she brilliantly posited the theory that the Apollonian and Dionysian divide in man never really left us despite the cultural and chronological distance of ancient Greek myths. Men are still thrusting toward the need to conquer and women still nurture but also have an incredible power over men. These are tough pills to swallow in today\u2019s society of identity politics in which the struggle to erase the differences between men and women is all consuming, but according to Paglia, we are still re-enacting the most primal archetypes of humanity.\n\nIn the introduction to the new book, Paglia tells us that \u201cthis book is not for everyone.\u201d It is not for people who believe to have found an \u201cabsolute truth about mankind;\u201d it is not for people who are interested in controlling speech; or \u201cfor those who believe that art is a servant of political agendas;\u201d or for people who wallow in victim culture; or \u201cfor those who see human behavior as wholly formed by oppressive social forces.\u201d Instead, this book is for people who \u201celevate free thought and free speech over all other values; for those who see art as a \u201cmedium of intuition and revelation; it is for people who support gender equality but don\u2019t demand \u201cspecial protections for women as weaker sex\u201d; for people \u201cwho see nature as a vast and sublime force\u201d; and finally, \u201cfor those who see life in spiritual terms as a quest for enlightenment, a dynamic process of ceaseless observation, reflection, and self-education.\u201d In other words, this book is for people who are interested in reflecting on what it means to be a human being.\n\nNo matter which subject Paglia writes about, she seems to at once channel Friedrich Nietzsche, Marquis de Sade, and Georges Bataille and yet, out of nowhere, she can become Plato, Shakespeare, and Bernini, chiseling and crafting words that come out of utterly masculine power, and then she throws another curveball and draws inspiration from St. Teresa of Avila\u2014a Spanish Carmelite mystic\u2014whom she calls \u201ca woman of the future, blending practical realism with passionate idealism.\u201d\n\nThe intellectual and spiritual openness that resides in Camille Paglia\u2019s being is visible in all of the essays collected in this book. It is impossible to mention every essay here (the book is a whopping 736 pages!) but the overarching theme running through all of them is Paglia\u2019s concern for freedom and individuality.\n\nToday, the most apparent danger to free speech is found on college and university campuses. In \u201cFree Speech and the Modern Campus,\u201d Paglia centers her discussion around the notion of political correctness. For her, political correctness is always borne out of revolution but, inevitably, it turns sour. After the revolution is over, the original \u201crebels begin to fight among themselves, which may lead to persecution and assassinations. The victorious survivor then rules like the tyrants that were toppled in the first place.\u201d\n\nInevitably, Paglia claims, the original and well-meaning \u201crevolutionary principles . . . become merely slogans, verbal formulas enforced by apparatchiks, that is, party functionaries or administrators who kill great ideas by institutionalizing them.\u201d Today, most institutions of higher education ought to have the same advertising slogan: a place where freedom of thought comes to die.\n\nPaglia is emphasizing the irony that institutions that once were hotbeds for individual and academic freedom are now petri dishes of dangerous and yet boring ideologies. They\u2019ve become places, it seems, with a mission to destroy any authentically wisdom-seeking mind. The problem of higher education is also \u201cintensified by the increasing fixation of humanities and even history departments on \u2018presentism,\u2019 that is, preoccupation with our own modern period.\u201d Indeed, everything is seen through the lens of today\u2019s problems and so, reading Plato or Shakespeare or Milton becomes about deconstructing the text instead of understanding it on its own terms. But this isn\u2019t akin to parsing a sentence for grammar and then putting the parts back together. Rather, this kind of deconstruction is an assault on the text with an explicit intention to discredit (as if they can!) the literary and philosophical canon.\n\nPaglia is a great contributor to the elevation of film as an art form while at the same time she rejects the dullness and joylessness of film analysis from an academic perspective. In \u201cThe Waning of European Art Film,\u201d she reflects on fond memories of seeing films by Ingmar Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni and the fact that \u201cTragically, very few young people today, teethed on dazzling special effects and a hyperactive visual style, seem to have patience for the long, slow take that deep-think European directors once specialized in.\u201d Although this is true, it is highly plausible that even at the time of their release, very few people had the patience for such films, especially in America. Nevertheless, Paglia\u2019s wide-rangng knowledge of film directors, such as Bergman, Truffaut, and Fellini, illuminates her own thirst for cinematic provocations and the probing of the human soul.\n\nPaglia\u2019s writings on gender culminate in her discussion of gender fluidity as seen in the various personae of David Bowie. In \u201cTheater of Gender: David Bowie at the Climax of the Sexual Revolution,\u201d Paglia\u2019s commentary on the great performer is just as unique and deep as Bowie himself. She rightly recognizes Bowie\u2019s early performative choices as Romanticism and his constant playing with the notion of androgyne. As Ziggy Stardust, Bowie took gender \u201cinto another dimension of space-time, where sexual personae of both East and West met and melded.\u201d\n\nThroughout his entire career, Bowie constantly redefined the notion of gender and sexuality but the difference between him and the ideological gender warriors of today, is that for Bowie this was a fluidity that had aesthetic foundations as opposed to the elimination of biological differences between men and women.\n\nPaglia fully supports this, and in \u201cFeminism and Transgenderism\u201d (an interview with Jonathan V. Last), Paglia says that \u201cAlthough I describe myself as transgender (I was donning flamboyant male costumes from early childhood on), I am highly skeptical about the current transgender wave, which I think has been produced by far more complicated psychological and sociological factors than current gender discourse allows. Furthermore, I condemn the escalating prescription of puberty blockers (whose long-term effects are unknown) for children, which I regard as a criminal violation of human rights.\u201d As we can see, Paglia\u2019s position is unique and does not fit neatly into any existing intellectual categories.\n\nAlthough she has always supported the Democratic party, Paglia has no problem calling Bill Clinton a \u201chormonal president.\u201d Of course, her political commentary would be incomplete if she didn\u2019t reflect on Donald J. Trump, whom she calls the \u201cviking dragon.\u201d Trump, according to Paglia, \u201cis his own publicist, a quick-draw scrapper and go-for-the-jugular brawler. He is a master of the unexpected (as the Egyptian commander Achillas calls Julius Caesar in Liz Taylor\u2019s Cleopatra).\u201d\n\nPaglia has always exhibited an aesthetic \u201cdisinterestedness\u201d\u2014a writer\u2019s disposition that looks at the subjects (whether persons or ideas) as objectively as possible, and this is clearly visible in her treatment of political leaders and even of moral subjects. Is this a weakness? Not necessarily because Paglia does not pretend to be a moral philosopher. She has always been authentic and straight-forward about her views and positions.\n\nRather, Paglia is a cultural critic who sees the threads that connect one aspect of society with another and because of this, her perspective is invaluable. Paglia\u2019s own stubborn freedom of thought, as well as her intellectual and spiritual openness, are inspiring. She is and remains a significant voice in the analysis of culture.\n\nAt times, her love of popular culture (low art) appears to minimize the importance of high art but it is precisely this unusual way of looking at the world that makes her unique and powerful. More than anything, her style and \u00e9lan vital invites readers to think further about culture and ideas and, in a society dominated by ideology, this is something we need now more than ever.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Melonic.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
