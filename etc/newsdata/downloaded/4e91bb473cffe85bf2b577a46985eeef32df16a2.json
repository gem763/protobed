They also believe it will delay necessary investment in new ships that would use carbon-neutral engines.\n\nShipping companies have used slow steaming before, not for the environmental benefits but to effectively reduce capacity and cut fuel costs in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis while keeping vessels operating. The IMO said in a 2014 report that the average speed of ships declined 12% from 2008 to 2012. The report said shipping\u2019s contribution to global greenhouse-gas emissions fell from 2.8% in 2007 to 2.2% in 2012.\n\nMaritime broker Clarkson PLC wrote in a separate report that average vessel speeds have declined by around 21% across all ship types over the past 10 years, and that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in the sector has declined by an average 18%.\n\nThat reduction has come with a broader restructuring of the maritime sector, with massive consolidation over the past five years and a move by the remaining carriers to operate larger but fewer vessels.\n\nFor retailers and manufacturers, a slow-steaming mandate would ripple across international supply chains, with products taking more time to arrive and companies likely paying more for transport costs because of the longer sailings.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cCargo will be delayed, there will be higher stock volumes and more waiting days at port terminals and more port congestion,\u201d said Jordi Espin, maritime policy manager at the European Shippers Council, which represents Europe\u2019s biggest exporters and importers.\n\nShipping companies would have to add more ships in major trade loops between Asia and Europe to make up for the delays, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf more ships are added to compensate for slow steaming, it will cost significantly more to move cargo and I don\u2019t know how will this help the environment,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, a trade body representing America\u2019s biggest retailers.\n\nFrance first made its slow-steaming proposal at the IMO in April, backed by other European countries, including Greece, Germany, Belgium and Spain, where local owners make money by chartering their ships. But the move, which is going to be discussed again in November, \u201cis not gaining traction, with South American and Asian countries being flatly against,\u201d according to a senior delegate participating in the talks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will pass,\u201d this delegate said.\n\nAn array of countries including Japan, Korea, India, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Turkey fear slower deliveries in an industry already being hit by trade disputes and a weakening global economy, would harm transport of meat, vegetables and other time-sensitive exports.\n\nThe U.S. and China are also leaning against the proposal.\n\nShips move the world\u2019s commodities like oil, iron ore and grains and the vast majority of retail manufactured goods, including cars, home appliances, clothing and food.\n\nThey also collectively contribute up to 3% of the world\u2019s global pollution, an amount comparable to major emitting countries. To comply with the 2016 Paris climate accord, IMO members have agreed to improve fuel efficiency by 30% by 2025 and pledged to slash greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2050, compared with 2008 levels.\n\nThat effort is starting to reset the fundamentals of how ships get their power.\n\nShips have a 20- to 25-year lifespan so any new orders over the next decade will have to be for vessels with new designs that will burn ammonia, hydrogen, batteries or biofuels as a means of propulsion.\n\n\u201cMandatory speed reduction will favor old, inefficient ships in service and remove the incentive to engage in efficiency improving innovation,\u201d said a spokeswoman for A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, parent of Danish container ship behemoth Maersk Line, which has pumped billions of dollars into bigger and more efficient vessels.\n\nLars Jensen, head of Copenhagen-based SeaIntelligence Consulting, said the industry can\u2019t afford to invest in new, environmentally friendly ships while also buying conventional vessels to mitigate the impact of slow steaming on their services and finances.\n\n\u201cIt will either go to build the next generation of sustainable ships, or to build more conventional ships to adhere to an artificial speed limit,\u201d he said.\n\nBig banks including Citigroup Inc., France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA, Norway\u2019s DnB AS A and Netherlands-based ABN AMRO Bank NV recently said they would take climate considerations into account for the first time when extending shipping loans.\n\nThe banks, with a combined shipping portfolio of about $100 billion, signed in June an industrial framework known as the Poseidon Principles, which will direct new money for shipping toward environmentally friendly vessels.\n\n\u201cWe will say yes for those kind of vessels that contribute to green shipping and no to others that are not needed in the world fleet,\u201d said Michael Parker, chairman of Citigroup\u2019s shipping and logistics business \u201cThat\u2019s how you help the environment, not slow steaming.\u201d\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s call for commercial ships to reduce their speed on the water to address climate change is music to the ears of many shipowners, but maritime regulators aren\u2019t likely to join the chorus.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102176/social"}
