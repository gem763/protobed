On the left, the ancient Greek ruins of Solunto; on the right, the splendid Arab-Norman city of Cefal\u00f9. In the centre, a crystalline sea as blue as the sky.\n\nFor twenty years, Sicily\u2019s most powerful mafia bosses plotted the murders of countless policemen and politicians from this spot, part of a 400 sq metre villa in the coastal resort town of Casteldaccia, known as the Miami of Sicilian mobsters, a few kilometres from Palermo.\n\nBut the godfathers are now gone and in their place is Gianluca Cal\u00ec, an anti-mafia businessman who is about to turn their former stronghold into a holiday house.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The entrepreneur Gianluca Cal\u00ec, photographed in the small private harbour of his villa \u2013 previously owned by the former mafia boss Michele Greco, and now turned into a holiday house. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nThe villa, hidden among low walls and vegetation, has been vacant for almost 25 years, despite investigators\u2019 suspicions that the premises may have continued to serve as a drugs and weapons deposit or a hiding place for kidnapping victims. The estate even has its own dock; a luxury reserved for a tiny minority of the island\u2019s inhabitants. Mafia bosses could freely dock their boats a few metres from the villa, or make an easy escape in case of a police raid.\n\nWork is currently underway. In a few weeks, the villa will be equipped to receive up to 32 guests among its 24 rooms. The mafia is still remembered, but with a twist \u2013 in the living room hangs an iconic anti-mafia photo of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, the two magistrates killed in 1992 after their investigation of the Sicilian mafia, known colloquially as Cosa Nostra (our thing), led to the arrest of hundreds of mobsters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gianluca Cal\u00ec holds the photo of the judges Falcone and Borsellino, killed by the mafia in Palermo in 1992. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nCal\u00ec, 46, knows the mafia too. The owner of a car dealership, he can count the number of vehicles he has had torched in the last 9 years. \u201cAround ten,\u201d he says, smiling nervously.\n\nHis problems began at the end of 2010, a few months before the purchase of the villa, when a successful year of used car sales did not go unnoticed in Casteldaccia. \u201cTwo members of the local mafia family came to our office and told my brother that they needed cash to pay for the clan\u2019s legal expenses. It was a request for protection money. We refused and shortly thereafter they torched the first car.\u201d\n\nCal\u00ec reported the incident to the police and decided to invest part of his profits in a villa on the coast of Casteldaccia that was going up for auction.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The BMW X5 of Gianluca Cal\u00ec, burned in a mafia attack in November 2015, is today parked at the Cal\u00ec\u2019s car dealership as an anti-mafia memorial. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nHe had no idea that the previous owner had been Michele \u201cThe Pope\u201d Greco, the boss of bosses of Cosa Nostra and, for several years, the head of a group of leading mobsters called the Sicilian Mafia Commission.\n\nGreco had purchased the land in 1965 and built his summer residence there two years later. He hadn\u2019t chosen the site by chance. Next door lived the boss Pietro Vernengo, AKA \u201cBazooka Eyes\u201d, a multiple murderer who had dissolved some of his victims in acid. Fifty metres away lived Stefano Bontade, one of the most powerful Sicilian mafia bosses, later gunned down on his birthday in 1981.\n\nGreco used to hold summit meetings of the Sicilian Mafia Commission in the villa, planning some of the most infamous murders in Italian history. The killing of Pio La Torre, an Italian communist party leader who proposed a law making Mafia association a crime, was ordered on the terrace. The murder of General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, sent as prefect to Sicily to combat the mafia, was commissioned by the bosses while relaxing in the living room the same year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aerial view over the coast of Altavilla Milicia, about 20km from Palermo.

It was a blatant threat. That\u2019s when something clicked. I had already been through the first arson attacks for refusing to pay protection money, but I was determined not to let them win. I then decided to transform the villa into an anti-mafia museum and a vacation home for tourists.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The villa, seen from the air. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nCal\u00ec, moved to Milan in the meantime and says he lost count of the threats. In 2014, a local mafia boss, now a police informant, stated that he had decided to shoot Cal\u00ec with a .45 calibre pistol that year. Fortunately the police arrested him a few days later.\n\nCal\u00ec sleeps with a gun under his pillow and drives an armoured car, but he says he has not given up. His extortionist, the mafia boss Antonino Virruso, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last September. A sign on the villa gate reads: \u201cIn the house, the Mafia has lost\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gianluca Cal\u00ec\u2019s assistant inside one of the rooms of the villa. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nIf you ask him whether the guests will be safe spending the night there, after the hardships suffered by himself and his family, Cal\u00ec points to the dozens of security cameras. \u201cThe only time someone tried to break in, in 2014, an arrest was made the following day.\n\n\u201cThere is also law enforcement, who patrol this area and protect me and my customers. The mafia and the Grecos shouldn\u2019t frighten anyone,\u201d he adds.\n\nMichele Greco was arrested in 1986. He joined hundreds of other defendants in a large anti-mafia trial that lasted six years and became known as the Maxi-Trial. Greco was charged with ordering 78 murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 2008, two years before Cal\u00ec bought the villa.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gianluca Cal\u00ec photographed inside his villa, previously owned by former mafia boss Michele Greco and now turned into a holiday house. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\n\nThe men who orchestrated his downfall are the same two depicted in the photo now hanging inside.\n\n\u201cI could care less what Greco must be thinking from hell about what has become of his villa,\u201d says Cal\u00ec. \u201cBut I\u2019m confident that, from heaven, Falcone and Borsellino, just like in that photo, are doubled over in laughter.\u201d", "description": "Gianluca Cal\u00ec was threatened by the mob for years, but now he\u2019s turning an old mafia villa into a holiday house", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36157a543412de9a08300f52b253d1b8adca3f0f/690_213_6030_3618/master/6030.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=251e2fd5729e4f3d662f7f98e240ec69", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
