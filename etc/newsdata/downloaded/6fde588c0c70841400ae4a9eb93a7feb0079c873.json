Given the uncertain increase in graphical abilities I\u2019m not really sure what to expect from the new consoles but what I am hoping for is new IP, i.e. things that aren\u2019t sequels or licensed games. We have had so few of these this gen that I think it has been the biggest failing by far.\n\nI can only hope publishers think the same way but it has got me wondering what is the best new IP of this gen, after all it\u2019s not like there\u2019s been many. Bloodborne is the first to come to mind, even though it\u2019s a SoulsBorne game and so not completely distinct from Dark Souls and Demon\u2019s Souls from the previous gen.\n\nARMS was pretty good on Switch but a bit underdeveloped and there\u2019s been no sign of a new one so far. Splatoon sort of counts, because it started on the Wii U, but there\u2019s still debate as to which generation that is, but I\u2019ll say it\u2019s a pass and so the best new game Nintendo has had in a long while.\n\nOverwatch, Rocket League, and the often forgotten Nioh have also been really good. Sony has also been excellent in general in terms of promoting new IP and while it\u2019s not the best they\u2019ve put out I think Horizon Zero Dawn has the most potential. Loved the setting, the art style, and while it was a little shallow there\u2019s plenty of scope to improve it. So I think it\u2019s between that, Overwatch, and Splatoon. Three great games but it\u2019s not exactly a crowded category!\n\nSurotu", "description": "The Thursday Inbox asks whether Red Dead Redemption 2 reviews were too generous, as one reader hopes that Bluepoint are making an Ico remake.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/horizon-zero-dawn_1571267234.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
