She wrote that he is her favorite of her three children, saying: 'Dez and I have a special bond that no one else will ever match because we\u2019ve grown up together'\n\nOn October 5, Jaime shared a snap of her smiling outside with son Dezi James Calvo, whom she shares with ex-fianc\u00e9 Eric Cubiche.\n\n'Best time ever hangin with my favorite son, Dezi,' she wrote. 'That\u2019s right I said it. I have a favorite son although I luv all 3 of my boys with everything I have in me.\n\n'Dez and I have a special bond that no one else will ever match because we\u2019ve grown up together. #firstborn #iloveyou,' she concluded.\n\nJaime also has twins with boyfriend Hamzi Hijazi, something her Instagram followers are well aware of.\n\nSince she posted the admission, several of those followers have chastised her for admitting she has a favorite, particularly in such a public way.\n\nThink twice before posting! Commenters have chastised her for admitting she has a favorite, particularly in such a public way\n\n'I feel so sorry for your other boys... I can't imagine how this must make them feel. This is heartbreaking,' wrote one.\n\nThe lesser children: Jaime has twin one-year-olds (pictured with Dezi)\n\n'This is ridiculous,' chided another.\n\n'Literally any therapist would tell you how damaging this is to your other children. I'm sure you're a great mom but this was not a cool thing to put out there... forever.'\n\n'I really truly hope that this is not how you really feel,' another said. 'If so, why use social media to make your other children feel bad. Please tell me this is a joke. Signed, 1 of 6. Not the favorite.\n\nOther shared their own memories of being the children of parents with clear favorites, with one writing that it 'always made me feel like s***.'\n\n'That's an insane thing to say when u have other children,' one woman commented. 'I feel for the others. And how they may feel after hearing this.'\n\nWhen one person said that they hoped that Dezi had stolen her phone and wrote this himself, another follower replied in agreement, saying that Jaime is 'literally telling her other two boys that they will never match the bond that her and their big brother have with their mom.'\n\nFamily: Jaime and boyfriend Hamzi Hijazi (left) share twins Lenon and Leo (right)\n\nFine by then: Others came to her defense, calling her honestly admirable and admitting that they, too, have favorites\n\nSurprisingly, though, dozens of commenters also chimed in to defend Jaime, claiming that they, too, have favorites and aren't afraid to admit it.\n\n'I have 6 kids and always say my favorite is my first born. Sorry, he is. I love them all but the first is special,' wrote one.\n\nOthers said there was 'no shame' in what she said, while several found her honestly refreshing.\n\n'Too many people/parents are unwilling to be truthful and say things like this,' said one.\n\n'You gotta respect honesty,' wrote another.\n\nJaime, whose on-screen credits include My Name is Earl, Joe Dirt, and Mom, has not responded to the backlash.", "description": "On October 5, Jaime Pressly shared a snap of herself with her eldest son Dezi.
