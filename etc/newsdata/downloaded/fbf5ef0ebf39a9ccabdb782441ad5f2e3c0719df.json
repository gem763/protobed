But it\u2019s where she sat, and the very place she occupied in the culture for close to a half century \u2014 up front, in the midst of the action \u2014 establishing the tone and terms for debates on taste, language, global literature, ethics and photography, involving herself in matters of military intervention and genocide. Not for her the stately remove of the American intellectual, the retiring panel-dweller \u2014 never mind the risk to her neck; Sontag was in Sarajevo during the Bosnian War and Berlin as the wall fell. She was the striking subject of photographs by Richard Avedon, Diane Arbus and Robert Mapplethorpe \u2014 a Zelig-like figure who even made a cameo in \u201cZelig.\u201d\n\nSontag died in 2004, of complications of leukemia. Since then, another essay collection has been published, along with the first two volumes of her diaries, chronicles of her \u201csore heart + unused body\u201d \u2014 the one place where she wrote frankly about her homosexuality and grieved for her unhappy relationships. Monographs, memoirs and remembrances have followed, including her son David Rieff\u2019s account of her final illness, \u201cSwimming in a Sea of Death\u201d; Phillip Lopate\u2019s affectionately rivalrous study of her work, \u201cNotes on Sontag\u201d; the scholar Terry Castle\u2019s tart essay on their friendship; and the novelist Sigrid Nunez\u2019s \u201cSempre Susan,\u201d an account of sharing an apartment with Sontag when Nunez and Rieff dated in the \u201970s. To add to the shelf, there is now the authorized biography, \u201cSontag: Her Life and Work,\u201d by Benjamin Moser, a book as handsome, provocative and troubled as its subject.\n\nOne note recurs through many Sontag stories. It is puzzlement \u2014 ranging from the amused to the appalled \u2014 at the gulf between her public preoccupation with ethical action and some truly filthy private behavior. She was prone to fits of grandiosity and torrential abuse, particularly to her longtime partner, the photographer Annie Leibovitz. She was said to oscillate, as a mother, between neglect and invasive closeness. There was \u201cGood Susan and Bad Susan,\u201d Salman Rushdie wrote in his memoir, \u201cJoseph Anton.\u201d \u201cBad Susan could be a bullying monster.\u201d", "description": "Benjamin Moser\u2019s authorized biography of the essayist, critic and cultural icon Susan Sontag pays closest attention to its subject\u2019s persona as a \u201cgreat original creation.\u201d", "authors": ["Parul Sehgal"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/books/17bookmoser1/17bookmoser1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
