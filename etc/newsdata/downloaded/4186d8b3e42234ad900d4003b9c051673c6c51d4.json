REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nLawyer Michael Levy said the company has not been given any material information as to why its counsel, James Cole, should be removed.\n\nCole is Huawei\u2019s lead lawyer in the U.S. case against the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker for allegedly misleading global banks about its business in Iran.\n\nU.S. prosecutors have asked the judge in the case to disqualify Cole, claiming his work as the No. 2 official in the Justice Department created \u201cirresolvable conflicts of interest.\u201d Prosecutors say Cole, who served as former deputy attorney general until 2015, had access to confidential information that he could use against the government.\n\nIn oral arguments in Brooklyn federal court, Levy told U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly that the decision to try to disqualify Cole was part of a \u201cbarrage\u201d against the company that also includes a separate Justice Department case alleging trade secret theft and a decision to place Huawei on a Commerce Department blacklist that bans most U.S. sales to the firm.\n\n\u201cThis case is quite clearly part of an overall agenda by the government against Huawei,\u201d Levy argued. The move to disqualify Cole, Levy said, \u201ccan be seen as one more tactical step.\u201d\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney David Kessler told the judge the matter related to \u201ca single criminal case,\u201d and that Huawei had numerous other lawyers.\n\nMuch of the government\u2019s argument is confidential and classified. Prosecutors say Cole supervised and participated in aspects of an investigation related to the Huawei case which has not been made public.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate question is whether Mr. Cole has the government\u2019s confidences,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s a close call.\u201d\n\nCole claims he has no recollection of matters referenced as the basis for him to be disqualified from the case, according to another court filing. He served as deputy attorney general until 2015, and he has represented Huawei for at least two years.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cole said he would make his case to the judge after she closed her courtroom to the public because of the classified information involved.\n\nThe judge did not indicate when she would rule on whether to disqualify Cole, and set the next court hearing for December 12.\n\nThe case against Huawei is proceeding as Beijing and Washington engage in an escalating trade war.\n\nIt also is taking place as the United States has pressured other countries to drop Huawei from their cellular networks, worried its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the company says are unfounded.\n\nHuawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the United States in connection with the case.\n\nMeng and others are accused of conspiring to defraud HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei\u2019s relationship with a company that operated in Iran, putting them at risk of violating U.S. sanctions.\n\nMeng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.\n\nCole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in Brooklyn in March.", "description": "The effort to stop a former U.S. Justice Department official from representing Huawei is another step in a broader U.S. government campaign against the Chinese company, a lawyer for Huawei argued on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Karen Freifeld", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426372140&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830T3"}
