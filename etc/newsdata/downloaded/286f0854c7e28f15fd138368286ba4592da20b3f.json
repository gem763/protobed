Kevin Huerter made big strides during his rookie season. De\u2019Andre Hunter, Cam Reddish and Bruno Fernando were drafted this year to further bolster the roster. Former No. 2 overall pick Jabari Parker was signed in free agency.\n\nNone are older than 24.\n\n\u201cWe need to see what this little young core can do together,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cDo they fit together? We certainly think they\u2019re going to fit together nicely. That\u2019s the plan. But we haven\u2019t been able to see it yet. We need to see those guys in action. That doesn\u2019t mean a month. I\u2019m talking about seeing them together for a whole year.\u201d\n\nSchlenk will concede there are no certainties in the rebuilding game, that much of the process is just gut instinct hopefully coupled with a lot of luck.\n\nWhen he was at Golden State, no one knew that Stephen Curry would develop into one of the NBA\u2019s biggest stars. But the front office began to sense something special was happening when a sixth-seeded team won a playoff series and took San Antonio to six games in the second round in 2013, so the decision was made to pursue a risky trade for Andre Iguodala.\n\nTwo seasons later, the Warriors won the first of what would be three titles in a run of five straight trips to the NBA Finals.\n\nRemembering how the Iguodala trade fell into place, Schlenk said, \u201cWe could continue to go with these young guys, but we have a veteran who wants to come play with these young guys. We knew that would speed up the timeline, but we felt like we had a chance with that acquisition to become a really good team.\u201d\n\nThe Hawks aren\u2019t in that position.\n\nNot yet anyway.\n\nThe big push could come next year, when expiring contracts will free up some $64 million for free agency or trades.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to really know until we see this young group play together,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and say today, unless you\u2019re one of a handful of teams, that we have a chance to be special.\u201d\n\nWhen training camp begins on Tuesday, the Hawks will be keeping a watchful eye on several of their young players.\n\nCollins is dealing with a right hip strain, so his workload will be limited during the preseason. The same goes for Huerter, who returned to Atlanta late last month complaining of a sore knee. An MRI showed no structural damage, but the Hawks won\u2019t take any chances.\n\nThen there\u2019s Reddish, the No. 10 overall pick out of Duke. While he has been fully cleared to resume on-court activities after undergoing core muscle surgery, the team will carefully monitor his workload leading up to the regular season.\n\nPierce said it\u2019s vital that the Hawks keep everyone healthy if they\u2019re going to take the next step in their development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re putting a team together, especially a young team, if you can\u2019t see them all out there together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to see what to expect moving forward and having that breakthrough moment. That\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re being cautious and will remain cautious with every guy. We\u2019re in no rush to advance anyone. We don\u2019t want to skip steps. Health is at the forefront of everything we do, then take it from there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As the Atlanta Hawks head into the third year of a massive overhaul, there are definite signs of hope.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
