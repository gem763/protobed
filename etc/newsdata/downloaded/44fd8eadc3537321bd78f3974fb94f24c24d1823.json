REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nThe exchanges were released by Democrats in the House of Representatives as part of an impeachment investigation to determine whether Trump pressed for Ukraine to probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in connection with Ukrainian gas company Burisma.\n\nBiden is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. His son was on the board of Burisma for a number of years.\n\nKurt Volker, who resigned a week ago as Trump\u2019s special representative to Ukraine, provided the messages to members of the House and staff of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees in a closed-door meeting earlier on Thursday.\n\nDemocrats are focusing on a July 25 telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the Republican president urges Zelenskiy to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\nIn the hours before that call, Volker told one adviser to the Ukrainian president that a meeting between the countries\u2019 two leaders was tied to Kiev\u2019s agreement to investigate the 2016 U.S. election, according to the committees.\n\n\u201cHeard from the White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d Volker wrote.\n\nLater messages between the aide, Andriy Yermak, and Volker showed dueling efforts to lock in a date for a Trump-Zelenskiy meeting and to issue a statement from Kiev announcing a \u201creboot\u201d of relations along with the probes into Burisma and the 2016 election.\n\nIn a separate exchange last month, another top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine wrote that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold military aid for the country as it confronted Russian aggression, according to copies of the messages released by the panel\u2019s Democratic chairmen, who noted their \u201cgrave concerns.\u201d\n\nThe cache also included messages from Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who played a major part in the administration\u2019s dealings with Kiev.\n\nJoe Biden leads in most opinion polls among the 19 Democrats seeking the party\u2019s nomination to take on Trump in the November 2020 election. His campaign has blasted Trump\u2019s efforts as desperate.\n\nIn a signal of how Kiev will handle investigations being watched in Washington, Ukrainian prosecutors said they would review 15 old probes related to Burisma\u2019s founder but added that they were unaware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Biden\u2019s son.\n\nWHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS\n\nSeparately, the White House plans to argue that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, must have the full House vote to formally approve an impeachment inquiry, a source familiar with the effort said.\n\nWithout a vote, White House lawyers believe Trump, who has called the impeachment probe a \u201choax,\u201d can ignore lawmakers\u2019 requests, the source said, meaning the federal courts would presumably have to render a decision and potentially slow the march toward impeachment.\n\nA White House letter arguing Pelosi must hold a House vote could be sent to Capitol Hill as early as Friday, the source said. It comes as the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee plans to issue more subpoenas in the coming days as it pushes ahead with the investigation.\n\n\u201cCongress must not back down from our duty to defend the Constitution as ... (Trump) ignores the Founders\u2019 warnings about foreign interference at every turn,\u201d Pelosi tweeted early on Friday.\n\nTrump\u2019s gambit is emerging at the end of a storm-tossed week for him as the president lashed out at Democrats, reporters and anyone else standing in his way to air complaints that he was being unfairly accused and had done nothing wrong.\n\nTrump sees the impeachment probe as a harassing follow-up to the Russia probe that investigated accusations he colluded with Moscow in the 2016 presidential campaign. Russia denies interfering in the election.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded Russia did interfere with a scheme of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy and disparage his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nMueller found insufficient evidence to establish that Trump and his campaign had engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia and did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice.\n\nIn a new wrinkle, Trump said on Thursday that \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens\u201d over Hunter Biden\u2019s business ties to China, again inviting foreign interference in a U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. China experts said Beijing was unlikely to act on Trump\u2019s invitation.\n\nAdministration officials did not know Trump was going to raise the issue of China but said he had talked about it previously and they were not surprised by it, two sources familiar with the situation said.\n\nCNN reported late on Thursday that Trump raised the subject of Biden and another political rival, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, in a June call with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping that, like the Ukraine call, was stored on a secure server.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment on CNN\u2019s report.\n\nTrump\u2019s appeal to China was particularly striking given that Washington and Beijing are locked in a bitter trade war that has damaged global economic growth. They are due to hold another round of talks in the United States next week.\n\nPelosi, on Twitter, raised questions about what Trump may have offered \u201cChina in exchange for interfering in our election,\u201d including any possible action on trade.\n\nTrump, in his own tweet, wrote that his efforts to solicit foreign nations to investigate the Bidens have \u201cNOTHING to do with politics.\u201d\n\nMichael Atkinson, who is the inspector general of the intelligence community, is also expected to testify on Friday in another closed-door session centred on his review of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that lies at the heart of the Democratic complaint.\n\nMembers of the House Intelligence Committee will return to Washington from their home districts for the interview with Atkinson, who had determined the complaint raised issues of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nU.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, confirmed that Atkinson would appear, but the committee has not released any further details.", "description": "U.S. officials pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to launch investigations that could benefit President Donald Trump's personal political agenda in exchange for a meeting between the two countries' leaders, a cache of diplomatic texts released late on Thursday showed.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437090254&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9317J", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
