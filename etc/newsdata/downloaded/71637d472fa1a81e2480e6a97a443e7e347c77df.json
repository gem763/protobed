The Pro Controller was always what I recommended to anyone looking for a Switch gamepad, but not any longer. 8BitDo\u2019s SN30 Pro+ isn\u2019t perfect, but its biggest draw \u2014 its ability to be completely customised and reprogrammed \u2014 more than makes up for its few flaws.\n\n8BitDo SN30 Pro+ WHAT IS IT? A highly customisable Bluetooth controller. PRICE $74 LIKE It made a game I was highly looking forward to actually playable. DISLIKE Can only be customised through a Windows or macOS app.\n\nEditor's Note: For Aussies, this controller is only offered through Amazon US, so expect to pay a reasonable shipping fee.\n\nIf you grew up playing classic consoles like the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, or N64, you probably remember third-party controllers being just awful. If I ever went over to a friend\u2019s house to play video games, I always made sure to bring my own controller lest I be stuck with a knock-off and destined to lose at Mortal Kombat. (Sometimes a carpenter\u2019s tools are to blame.)\n\nThe state of third-party controllers has improved since then, thankfully, while still remaining competitive in price. If you need a couple of extra controllers for split-screen multiplayer gaming, no one\u2019s going to complain about getting stuck with an off-brand gamepad these days. But with 8BitDo\u2019s new SN30 Pro+, it\u2019s now actually hard to recommend Nintendo\u2019s $100 hardware when for $75 you can get a Switch-friendly wireless controller that feels better in the hand, offers buttons with a nicer tactile response, works with other gaming systems, and can be completely reconfigured and customised to suit even the most obsessive gamers.\n\nPhoto: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo The SN30 Pro+ is available in three colours including an all-black option, and versions mirroring the Game Boy and SNES\u2019 button colours. Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo The SN30 Pro+ charges and syncs over USB-C, and includes a pair of analogue triggers while Nintendo\u2019s Pro Controller doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe SN30 Pro+ looks like a mashup of the Switch Pro Controller and the PS4 DualShock gamepad, with side by side analogue joysticks and a directional pad paired with a set of four action buttons. I actually prefer the asymmetrical analogue stick layout of the Switch Pro Controller, but the directional pad on the SN30 Pro+ feels mushier (in a good way) and better suited to the intense button-mashing needed for playing retro 2D games, while the glossy action buttons rekindle fond memories of the N64 and SNES\u2019 own controllers.\n\nAnother big improvement is that unlike the Switch Pro Controller and the Joy-Cons, the SN30 Pro+ includes a pair of analogue triggers with extensive travel so that when playing titles like racing games you can better control your acceleration.\n\nIt\u2019s a feature that\u2019s supported by many games in the Switch library, but not by Nintendo\u2019s actual controller hardware, which is bizarre. The SN30 Pro+ also includes motion controls and rumbling. Neither are quite as effective or nuanced as Nintendo\u2019s own implementations, but those are also features I, personally, don\u2019t care about.\n\nThe SN30 Pro+ not only features a swappable rechargeable battery, but it can also be replaced with a pair of AAs as needed. (Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo)\n\nUnlike the third-party controllers of yesteryear, 8BitDo\u2019s build quality is satisfyingly solid and more and more I find myself reaching for the company\u2019s hardware for gaming. The SN30 Pro+ also includes a rechargeable battery that can be juiced up with a USB-C cable, but it only offers about 20 hours of gameplay. Nintendo\u2019s Pro Controller boasts 40. But 8BitDo has made its battery pack removable, so you can swap it for a backup, or a pair of readily available AA batteries should you find yourself in a gaming emergency.\n\nSyncing the SN30 Pro+ to the Switch, a computer, or even an Android device isn\u2019t terribly complicated, but it requires different combinations of buttons to be pressed at power up for each specific device. It\u2019s a process I always need to look up first online, so I would love for 8BitDo to print or etch those instructions and button combos on the back of their controllers for easy reference. Once synced, however, the SN30 Pro+ automatically paired with my Switch whenever they were both powered up.\n\n8BitDo\u2019s Ultimate Software is currently only available for Windows and macOS, there\u2019s no mobile app, which is kind of disappointing. (Screenshot: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo)\n\nAt this point, I\u2019d still consider it a toss-up between the Switch Pro Controller and the SN30 Pro+, but with the latter, you also get the 8BitDo Ultimate Software which, in a manner of speaking, can be a literal game-changer.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone into a game\u2019s settings to remap a couple of buttons or invert a joystick\u2019s behaviour, then you\u2019re mostly familiar with what the Ultimate Software can do. But whereas only a few games actually offer a good level of controller customizability in their settings, the SN30 Pro+ brings it to everything.\n\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Software, available for Windows and macOS computers, lets gamers customise almost every aspect of the controller, and save various configurations for easy access later. You can remap any of the buttons, turn down or increase the rumbling feedback, program custom macros to trigger a series of commands with a single button press, adjust the sensitivity of the analogue joysticks and triggers, and generally make the controller behave exactly how you prefer.\n\nMany of the tweaks you make to the SN30 Pro+ can be tested in real-time inside the 8BitDo Ultimate Software app. (Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo)\n\nI understood why such customizability was important to some gamers, but the SN30 Pro+\u2019s best feature didn\u2019t seem like something I\u2019d ever actually use until I downloaded Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast \u2014 a game I was very excited to see ported to the Switch until I played it.\n\nOn a PC the game\u2019s first few missions, when your character doesn\u2019t wield the Force or a lightsaber, are easy to beat with a mouse, but dramatically more challenging when played with a gamepad. So much so that I immediately sought out cheat codes to give my character the Force, a lightsaber, and an admittedly unfair advantage right from the start.\n\nMaking matters worse was the fact that inverting the joystick\u2019s Y-axis for aiming isn\u2019t possible in Jedi Knight II\u2019s settings: an option that many gamers, including myself, prefer.\n\nFrustrated, I turned to the SN30 Pro+ and sure enough, inverting the Y-axis on the joystick was an easy one-click fix, as was re-arranging the action buttons because, for some reason, I kept accidentally activating the weapon select menu while playing. It took all of two minutes to fix and remedy some missing features in a game I was ready to completely abandon.\n\nIf there was one thing I\u2019d improve about the SN30 Pro+ it\u2019s that right now it can only be configured using the 8BitDo Ultimate Software app on a computer, and repeatedly having to connect and reconnect the controller with a USB-C cable to test your tweaks gets tedious. It also makes it hard to load up other configurations when you\u2019re away from your laptop. A mobile version of the app that worked wirelessly would be a big improvement as you could just turn to your iOS or Android phone which is always in reach.\n\nIt would also help to be able to do A/B testing right on the controller, where two different configurations could be uploaded and quickly toggled with a switch so you could easily test which one played better in a game.\n\nBut even with those suggested improvements, I\u2019m still quite impressed with the SN30 Pro+. 8BitDo has finally managed to do something this old school gamer never thought possible: it\u2019s created a controller that\u2019s not only better than Nintendo\u2019s, but cheaper too.\n\nREADME", "description": "Nintendo makes an excellent standalone controller for those who prefer gaming with something more substantial than the Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons.
