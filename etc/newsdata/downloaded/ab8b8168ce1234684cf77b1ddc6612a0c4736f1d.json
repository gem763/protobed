He purchased the house \u2013 where he spends no more than three weeks per year \u2013 in 2011 for $290,000.\n\nHe had already been paying taxes on income earned in New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeoffrey Weinstein, special counsel in the Tax, Trusts & Estates Department of Cole Schotz, told FOX Business that the ruling shows how New York State is not letting up on second homes.\n\n\u201cThe lesson learned is that maintaining any habitable vacation or second home in New York State will cause you to be subject to NYS/NYC tax if you work in Manhattan and spend more than 183 days there,\u201d Schotz said. \u201cTypically, the harm is much worse for those that keep a NYC apartment and are subject to NYC tax and unable to receive credit in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nGlenn Newman, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig who worked with Obus on the case, told FOX Business they will appeal the decision.\n\n\u201cWe believe that ownership of a vacation home should not qualify as a permanent place of abode,\u201d Newman said. \u201cThe judge concentrated on the physical aspects \u2013 it had heat, had a kitchen, had a bathroom \u2013 but didn\u2019t take into account the actual use of the house.\u201d\n\nNewman added that Obus\u2019 wife did not use the property at all, while he used it just a couple of times per year. It is located 200 miles from his place of employment.\n\nBy law, a \u201cmere camp or cottage,\u201d can be considered a vacation home.\n\nNewman went on to say that this ruling could affect the second home market in New York \u2013 which essentially makes people subject to double-taxation in the high-tax state. Obus can receive a refund from New Jersey for portions on which he was double-taxed.\n\nExperts have also told FOX Business that as New York State loses tax revenue from the flight of individuals to lower-tax havens \u2013 like Florida \u2013 auditors are likely only going to get more aggressive, specifically where wealthy residents are concerned.\n\nWeinstein noted that another takeaway from the tax case is that New York State has sophisticated audit tools for locating taxpayers who maintain a permanent place of abode in the state.\n\n\u201cThis case should serve as a warning for those who are maintaining residences in New York State/New York City and either: (i) have not clearly established domicile in another state and abandoned ties in NYS/NYC; or (ii) are over the 183 day count \u2013 NYS will find you!\u201d Weinstein warned.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAs previously reported by FOX Business, most individuals lose their audit cases against the state of New York. The average amount they are forced to cough up to the Empire State is $144,000.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2017, New York State collected about $1 billion from residency audits, according to data from audit defense company Monaeo.
