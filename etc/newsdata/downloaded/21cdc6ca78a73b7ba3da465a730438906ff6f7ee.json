Then Explain These Results", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s critics have called him many things during his nearly three years in office. \u201cRacist.\u201d \u201cFascist.\u201d \u201cMisogynist.\u201d \u201cAnti-middle class.\u201d \u201cAnti-poor.\u201d And so on. But if that\u2019s so, he\u2019s failing miserably at all those things they accuse him of.\n\nA spate of recent data and reports, including an update of the income and poverty statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau for 2017 and 2018, show just how bad that failure is.\n\nTake that \u201cracist\u201d charge. The Census report shows that black unemployment, at 5.5% in August, is the lowest it\u2019s been since records started being kept in 1972.\n\nThe gap between black unemployment and white unemployment is also the lowest on record.\n\nTypically, the unemployment rate for African Americans is at least two times the white unemployment rate. Today, it\u2019s about 1.6 times the white rate.\n\nIt isn\u2019t only African Americans who are doing better. Both Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans now have near-record low unemployment rates.\n\nJust ask the Washington Post. To its credit, it recently analyzed Labor Department data. What it found was shocking: More than 86% of the jobs added since the end of 2016 went to minorities. Out of 5.2 million new jobs, minorities accounted for 4.5 million.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s an abject failure.\n\nWhat about that other favorite epithet of the left, \u201cmisogynist\u201d? If Trump hates women so much, why do his policies seem to provide so many opportunities for them?\n\nAs The Daily Signal\u2019s Mary Margaret Olohan notes: \u201cAmong full-time, year-round workers, the number of women increased by 1.6 million and the number of men increased by about 700,000 between 2017 and 2018.\u201d\n\nThe median real income for female-headed households with no spouse rose 5.8% from 2017 to 2018. For married couples, there was no change. The poverty rate for female-led households shrank from 26.2% in 2017 to 24.9% in 2018.\n\nOK, but surely, billionaire Trump hates the poor and his policies have been disastrous for them, right?\n\nIn fact, as the Census data show, the number of people living in poverty fell by 1.4 million people in 2018 alone, with the poverty rate dropping from 12.3% to 11.8%, its lowest since before the 2007 financial crisis. That decline was led by female-headed households, minority ones in particular, the most vulnerable of all.\n\nMeanwhile, Department of Agriculture data show that 6.3 million Americans have fallen out of the food stamp program since Trump took office. The main reason: parents in poor families are getting jobs and are no longer eligible.\n\nCritics might have a point about the shrinking middle class. There are indeed fewer Americans falling into that classification. But not for the reasons you might think.\n\nAs economist Mark J. Perry notes, the middle class is shrinking and has been for a long time. The reason: As the economy expands, more people have entered the high-income brackets than ever before in history.\n\nSince 2007, the year before the financial crisis, the middle class \u2014 defined as those earning $35,000 to $100,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars \u2014 has fallen from 43% of the population to 41.7% in 2018.\n\nA sign that the middle class is being \u201csqueezed,\u201d as the left likes to say? Hardly.\n\nThe share of those considered \u201cpoor\u201d has also fallen, from 29.4% to 27.9% of the population.\n\nWhere did all the poor and middle class go? To the upper-income level. It swelled from 27.7% to 30.4%.\n\n\u201cMany prominent people like Paul Krugman and progressive politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren claim that American\u2019s middle class has been declining, disappearing, collapsing, losing ground, vanished, stagnated, etc.,\u201d Perry, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute recently wrote. \u201cBut the Census Bureau data on household income over time displayed above demonstrate conclusively that those assertions are incredibly and verifiably wrong.\u201d\n\nAs for those at the bottom, a recent report by the group Just Facts found that the poorest 20% of Americans consume more goods and services than the average citizen does in most rich countries, including Europe.\n\nAs James D. Agresti of the Foundation for Economic Education put it, \u201cIn other words, if the U.S. \u2018poor\u2019 were a nation, it would be one of the world\u2019s richest.\u201d\n\nThe point here is, those trends have accelerated under Trump, data show.\n\nAre these data surprising? Not when you consider that economists are almost unanimous in saying that the best antidote for poverty is a job.\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulation helped push economic and job growth up strongly after years of Obama-era stagnation.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean every policy the White House puts forth has been good for the economy, as the raging debate over tariffs shows.\n\nStill, as the old saying goes, \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d That\u2019s still true today. And for women and minorities, thanks to Trump\u2019s policies and the economy\u2019s ongoing expansion, the boats have never been higher.\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
