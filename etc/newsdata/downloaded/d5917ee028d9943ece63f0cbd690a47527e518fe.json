Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court raged, then-Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) struck a deal. Mr. Flake would delay confirming Mr. Kavanaugh until the FBI completed an investigation into credible allegations of sexual misconduct \u2014 but the investigation couldn\u2019t be open-ended or last ages. Despite these caveats, both senators insisted that the inquiry must be conducted in good faith. Mr. Flake said, \u201cIt does no good to have an investigation that gives us more cover.\u201d Mr. Coons declared that \u201cthe FBI needs to be allowed to pursue all reasonable investigatory steps.\u201d GOP senators who subsequently voted to confirm Mr. Kavanaugh praised the resulting investigation for being thorough.\n\nNow comes additional evidence that the investigation was, in fact, far from thorough and more of a sham than it seemed at the time. Reasonable investigative steps were not pursued.\n\nthe FBI interviewed practically no one regarding one of the allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh, in which one of his Yale classmates, Deborah Ramirez, said Mr. Kavanaugh drunkenly exposed himself to her.\n\nThis investigative shoddiness was apparently the fault not of the FBI but of Republicans looking for the cover Mr. Flake had claimed he did not want.\n\nAt first, they limited the FBI to questioning only four people about two separate allegations. Agents eventually got an expansion of the number of people they could contact \u2014 they interviewed 10 \u2014 but not an extension of their deadline: a mere week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) insisted that the Senate would vote within days. Under these pressures and limitations, the FBI interviewed few and turned in its report early.\n\nThe Senate got a woefully incomplete report. Republicans got their cover.\n\nThe Justice Department Office of the Inspector General should investigate exactly what marching orders the FBI got and when, and how its agents responded.", "description": "The FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be more of a sham than it seemed\nIn September 2018, as the battle over the confirmation of Brett M.
