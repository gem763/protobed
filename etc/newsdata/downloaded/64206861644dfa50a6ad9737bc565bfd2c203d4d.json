She returned to her surgeon, who allegedly said it was because she wasn\u2019t working hard enough in physical therapy \u2013 but she hadn\u2019t even been able to start the healing exercises because of the excruciating pain.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a trip to her primary care physician for pain management landed her in the office of Dr. Richard Lee at the Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Irvine, Calif., that she learned her C1 ring had flipped horizontally to rest on her C2 vertebrae, which was preventing her from turning her head from side to side and had resulted in a crooked posture, also known as a \u201ccock robin\u201d positioning.\n\nBOY, 12, SURVIVES 'FREAK' TRAMPOLINE ACCIDENT AFTER SPRING SHOT THROUGH BACK 'LIKE A BULLET'\n\nLee, a Harvard Medical School-trained spine surgeon, told his 70-year-old patient that she, unfortunately, would need to head back to the operating table, but not in the way that many people assume neck surgery is done. Bobeczko would also soon learn that Lee would possibly need to separate her skull from the rest of her body in order to completely free her from pain.\n\n\u201cThe first step was to remove the hardware that she had in her neck that her neurosurgeon had originally treated the fracture with,\u201d Lee told Fox News. \u201cThe second step was to go in and actually re-break her neck that had already healed to recreate essentially the original injury and remove the healed bone matter from her body\u2019s response to the natural healing process. The third step was to realign the head and neck back to the original angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no special trick to this \u2013 you have to do it very slowly and very meticulously.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Richard Lee\n\nLee and his team were hopeful that if steps one and two were successful in alleviating her pain, they wouldn\u2019t have to advance to step three. But nearly two weeks after they had operated on Bobeczko, her pain had only decreased by about 10 percent, so she was faced with the high-risk procedure of step three, that would require Lee and his team to access her spine through an incision in her mouth.\n\nROOSTER PECKS WOMAN TO DEATH IN 'RARE' ATTACK\n\n\u201cThe body had healed so that the C1 ring had flipped laterally on the C2 ring \u2013 the only way to fix something like that was to do a high-risk procedure of going in there and completely cutting across the C1/C2 joint, releasing all of the ligaments that were contracted and the joint capsule that was contracted, completely separating the C1 ring off the skeleton and realigning the lateral shift,\u201d Lee said.\n\nWhat made the procedure especially risky, was that Lee and his team had to go in through an incision in Bobeczko\u2019s mouth, which could welcome the opportunity for \u201ccatastrophic infection.\u201d They also faced the challenge of avoiding the major blood vessels located near the C1 area that lead to the brain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no special trick to this \u2013 you have to do it very slowly and very meticulously,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to break through the mouth, through the back of the throat.\u201d\n\nThe risk paid off, as Bobeczko just weeks later is back at home working toward returning to her job as a flight attendant.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cMy pain is gone, I have a little neckache at night time depending on how long I\u2019ve been walking \u2013 I go walking every day with my neighbor, she comes and gets me and we just walk around the complex,\u201d she said.\n\nBobeczko will remain in a brace for several more weeks, but has taken to calling Lee her \u201cmiracle worker.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe literally saved my life,\u201d she said.", "description": "He cut through her mouth to separate her skull from the rest of her body before realigning her head and neck back to the original angle.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein", "Dr. Richard Lee"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/pre_post_surgery.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
