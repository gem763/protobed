It notes that unhealthy habits such as smoking, poor eating and inactivity all add to the risk.\n\nThe atlas \u2014 an overview of cancer around the world \u2014 was produced by the American Cancer Society (ACS), Union for International Cancer Control, and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).\n\nCancer is the leading or second-leading cause of death before age 70 in 91 countries.\n\n\u201cThis much is clear. We simply must do better to ensure everyone can benefit from advances in the fight against cancer,\u201d Gary Reedy, ACS chief executive officer, wrote in the report\u2019s foreword.\n\nBut progress against cancer \u201cis not only possible, but also achievable,\u201d he said in an ACS news release.\n\nDr. Elisabete Weiderpass, director of IARC, noted that cancer is an issue of sustainable development.\n\n\u201cFacing the cancer problem is a prerequisite for addressing social and economic inequities, stimulating economic growth, and accelerating sustainable development,\u201d she wrote in the foreword. \u201cPrevention is, and should continue to be, the first line of attack in tackling the challenges posed by the global cancer epidemic.\u201d\n\nTobacco is the leading cause of preventable cancer death, according to the atlas. In 2017, smoking claimed 2.3 million lives worldwide, 24 percent of all cancer deaths.\n\nInfectious agents account for 15 percent of all new cancer cases worldwide, but the proportion varies widely. It ranges from about 4 percent in many affluent nations to more than 50 percent in several sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nMore than 90 percent of infection-related cancers are caused by Helicobacter pylori, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.\n\nOverweight and obesity increase the risk of 13 types of cancer and accounted for 3.6 percent of new cases in adults worldwide in 2012.\n\nCancer associated with overweight/obesity, unhealthy diet and inactivity are expected to rise in most parts of the world, the atlas said.\n\nAlcohol, meanwhile, is linked to 4.2 percent of cancer deaths worldwide, with significant country-to-country rate differences.\n\nIn almost all nations, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, accounting for nearly 1 in 4 new cancer cases among them.\n\nIf current trends continue, there will be about 44 million cervical cancer cases worldwide over the next half-century.\n\nAbout 270,000 cancer cases are diagnosed in children worldwide each year. Five-year survival rates in high-income countries top 80 percent, but can be as low as 20 percent in poor nations.\n\nMore information\n\nThe World Health Organization has more on cancer.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
