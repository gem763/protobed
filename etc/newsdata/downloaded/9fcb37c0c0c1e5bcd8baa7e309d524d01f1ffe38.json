PewDiePie), became a name associated with the shooting in Christchurch when the shooter said \u201csubscribe to PewDiePie\u201d before walking into the mosque and murdering everyone he could find.\n\nThis clearly put Kjellberg into a state of grief that he didn\u2019t talk about much, and despite the reality of the situation being that he had no part in the killing, he clearly carried some guilt. It didn\u2019t help that the mainstream media was pointing at this incident as proof that PewDiePie is the alt-right leader they\u2019ve always said he was.\n\nFast forward and you have the YouTube star passing the 100 million subscriber mark, which is monumental. To celebrate, Kjellberg declared that he was going to make a large donation to a charity, and chose the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Needless to say, the backlash against the move was massive.\n\nThe ADL had previously attacked Kjellberg and congratulated Disney for severing ties with him after a video which displayed Nazi imagery and two men holding a sign that said: \u201cDeath to all Jews.\u201d The video was proving that you can find anybody who will do anything online for money, and Kjellberg has denounced antisemitism and bigotry many times since.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many of Kjellberg\u2019s fans were upset due to the ADL being a part of various councils that advise social media companies on who and what they should restrict or ban, creating a lopsided political atmosphere on many social networks.\n\nKjellberg initially defended his choice to donate to the ADL in a Twitter post.\n\nHe has since deleted this tweet, as according to his latest video, he has changed his mind about the entire thing and has withdrawn his donation to the ADL.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I saw it as an opportunity to put an end to the alt-right claims that have been thrown against me,\u201d Kjellberg said.\n\nKjellberg continued by stating that he felt some responsibility for the Christchurch shooting, but that donating to the ADL was not the right way to go about it. He also mentioned that some things came out about the organization during the time that he learned about, and withdrew the donation.\n\nKjellberg continued by saying he would have known all this if he hadn\u2019t rushed to make this decision and explained that this decision was made while he was planning his wedding, and with the 100 million subscriber deadline coming up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for all the confusion, and I\u2019m sorry for messing this up,\u201d he concluded before going into his intended video.\n\nDespite the mistake that he made, Kjellberg deserves both our sympathy and our appreciation. Not only did he listen to the words of his fans, but in the end, he did the right thing and didn\u2019t take the route of appeasement, which too many people in the spotlight do in order to make bullies stop bullying them.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to point out a glaring problem in relation to how people are treated by these bullies, namely in the media.\n\nThe Christchurch shooter promoted Kjellberg right before a murdering spree and the media used this opportunity to bully Kjellberg, and pair him with supremacist radicals. I can\u2019t imagine what kind of hurt Kjellberg was feeling when he saw the video initially, and I can\u2019t imagine how it was compounded by articles and tweets sent to him, all declaring that this was his fault.\n\nIt\u2019s horrible that people with an ax to grind would go so far as to put the actions of a madman on an innocent person strictly because he ran afoul of them politically a few times.\n\nI want to commend Kjellberg for not caving to these people, as they really don\u2019t deserve to be caved to. More people should follow his lead.", "description": "YouTuber PewDiePie Withdraws Massive Donation to the ADL and Stands Up to Hard-Left Bullies", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Sister Toldjah", "Kira Davis", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Brad Slager", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-2-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
