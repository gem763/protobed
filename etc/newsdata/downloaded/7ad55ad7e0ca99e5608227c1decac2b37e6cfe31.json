But that history is unlikely to repeat now.\n\nGlobal crude oil prices initially jumped more than 10% in trading Sunday evening in response to Saturday\u2019s drone attack on a Saudi Arabian oil facility, which hit half of Saudi\u2019s productive capacity. The kingdom claimed one-third of the lost output would be restored by Monday although that remains to be seen.\n\nAway from energy, the market reaction Sunday evening was negative, as would be expected, with S&P 500 futures off 0.6% and most Asian markets also trading lower. But the dollar and Treasuries were little changed, with no evident flight to quality to boost these traditional havens.\n\nThe weekend attacks revived memories of past Middle East conflicts that presaged jumps in energy prices, from the Yom Kippur War in 1973 to the Iranian revolution of 1979 to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. President Donald Trump implied Sunday the U.S. was ready to take military action, tweeting \u201cwe\u2026are locked and loaded\u201d after accusing Iran of being behind the attack on the Saudi oil facilities.\n\nOn the assumption that the impact is confined to the oil market, however, the effect on the economy of the U.S. and the rest of the world should be contained. Trump also tweeted he has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which should forestall sharp price rises being felt by U.S. consumers.\n\nMore important, oil producers previously have only managed to put a floor under the price by cutting production, an indication that the market has been well supplied. To put things in perspective, the jump in benchmark U.S. crude prices Sunday evening only brought the active U.S. futures contract over the $60 a barrel mark, below where it traded last May and well below the $75 recent peak last October.\n\nTo be sure, the U.S. economy hasn\u2019t been immune to oil price spikes. Cornerstone Macro points out five of the past six recessions have been preceded by 20% oil price jumps, including the downturns of 1974, 1980, 1990, 2001, and 2008 (1981 was the lone exception that might be viewed as the second dip following the 1980 recession.) The firm offers three scenarios: Crude rising to $80 would result in a headwind to growth; $100 crude would mean a bigger headwind but no recession; and $150 would increase the risk of recession.\n\nThe U.S. skirted recession in 2015-2016 when oil prices collapsed, dropping from over $90 to under $30. The result was a wave of bankruptcies among leveraged producers and U.S. economic growth slumping below 1% in the final quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. As an oil producer, the U.S. now is hurt by falling prices at least as much as consumers are helped by paying less at the gasoline pump or to heat their homes. That is vastly different from when consumers were hard-hit by gas lines in the 1970s or 2008\u2019s shock of paying over $4 a gallon to fill their fuel tanks.\n\nThe U.S. economy also is in a markedly different place now from previous price spikes. Cornerstone Macro notes the 1990 recession already was likely when the oil spike worsened that downturn. During the 2002-2007 expansion, energy prices often jumped more than 20% year-on-year, including in Gulf War 2, without triggering downturns.\n\nIf consumers think the oil-price jump is temporary, they may be able to keep up their robust spending. Retail sales rose 0.4% last month, the Commerce Department reported Friday, following an upwardly revised gain of 0.8% in July, originally estimated as 0.7%. High Frequency Economics\u2019 Jim O\u2019Sullivan estimates personal consumption should grow at a strong 3.7% annual rate in the third quarter, after the second quarter\u2019s 4.7% pace. Strategas economist Don Rissmiller also points out the consumer savings rate of 7.7% provides a cushion to offset the pain of higher energy costs.\n\nAuto strikes in the past also have dealt a blow to the economy. The United Autoworkers struck General Motors(ticker: GM) at midnight Sunday, which was the first stoppage in over a decade. The 1998 strike against GM\u2019s Flint, Mich., facility stands out because it spread throughout the industry, costing the company $2.3 billion in foregone earnings and an estimated 1% from gross domestic product that year.\n\nThis walkout looks \u201cmanageable from a macro perspective,\u201d Rissmiller notes, but is added on top of numerous other issues weighing on the manufacturing sector. That would include the effects of U.S.-China trade tensions, which also have weighed heavily on Germany.\n\nFinally, the Federal Reserve seems set to provide further support for the economy with another one-quarter percentage point interest rate cut this week. The Fed focuses on so-called core inflation so it is likely to ignore any inflationary impact of an energy spike. And heading into next year\u2019s elections, Trump is apt to pull out all the stops to see the economy doesn\u2019t stumble, including from any possible impact from higher prices at the gas pump.\n\nWrite to Randall W.
