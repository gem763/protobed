He insisted U.S. interests, including preventing ethnic cleansing of the Kurds in the region and a resurgence of the Islamic State, or ISIS, are being served.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that this administration\u2019s efforts to crush ISIS will continue,\u201d Pompeo said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nParallel Universe\n\nBut New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and others on the Sunday morning political shows called the administration\u2019s actions a mistake that abandons the Kurds and other allies while bolstering Russia\u2019s position in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI think the secretary lives in a parallel, alternative universe,\u201d Menendez said on ABC.\n\nFormer Army General David Petraeus said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the U.S. has abandoned its Syrian Kurdish partners and called the U.S. actions \u201ca grave, strategic mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis does not end an endless war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt probably prolongs it.\u201d\n\nCritics say Trump gave Erdogan a green light to attack American-allied Kurdish militias, risking a resurgence of the Islamic State and a slaughter of the Kurds, when he pulled U.S. troops out of Syria.\n\nPolicy by Tweet\n\nThe president often makes policy on the fly, said Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful. \u201cWhat President Trump does is wake up in the morning and have a phone call or maybe a tweet and completely change years or even decades of U.S. policy, surprising his own generals and country,\u201d Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the Republican Party this year, said Trump knew what Turkey was going to do and can\u2019t justify his response now.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t wait \u2019till after withdrawing the troops to make a plan to go pressure Turkey to ease up and then call for a cease-fire,\u201d Amash said on \u2018Meet the Press.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult to put it all back together.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a tweet Sunday morning that the cease-fire is \u201cholding up very nicely,\u201d citing U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper -- whom he called \u201cMark Esperanto\u201d before correcting the spelling after almost two hours.\n\nEsper said U.S. troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq and continue to conduct operations against the Islamic State to prevent is resurgence, the Associated Press reported.\n\nGraham, who\u2019s been a harsh critic of Trump\u2019s Syria actions, said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that he spoke with the president this weekend and now sees a \u201chistoric\u201d result possible in Syria that protects oil interests.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is thinking outside the box,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI think we can end Syria successfully.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is in Jordan this weekend, leading bipartisan talks about Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria.\n\n\u2018Kangaroo Court\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to ISIS, Iran and Russia,\u201d Pelosi\u2019s office said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nPompeo, meanwhile, rejected accusations that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine for political reasons, saying \u201cI never saw that in the decision-making process that I was a part of.\u201d\n\nHe also said is \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d that state department lawyers are not allowed into depositions that Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been holding in private as part of the impeachment inquiry into Trump.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Secretary of State Michael Pompeo led the defenders of President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria, saying Sunday that a cease-fire is holding and that U.S. goals in the Middle East are being met despite criticism allies are being betrayed.Republican Senator Lindsey", "authors": ["Mark Niquette", "Billy House"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
