REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun\n\nThe 1,285-megawatt Xayaburi Dam\u2019s debut coincides with parts of the Mekong drying to a trickle even at the end of the rainy season, though its builders and operators say it is not responsible for the reduced river flow.\n\nXayaburi, which will sell 95% of its power to Thailand at an average rate of 2 baht ($0.066) per unit, is the first of at least nine more hydropower projects either under construction or planned on the lower Mekong in Laos.\n\nThe new spate of dam-building is poised to turbo-charge already-fraught water and food security disputes after years of worry about the 11 existing Beijing-built dams on the upper Mekong in China are choking the river on which millions depend for their livelihoods in Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nXayaburi Dam has been nine years in the making and the 135 billion baht ($4.47 billion) project, built and financed by Thai companies and banks, has been controversial since inception.\n\nOn Tuesday, Buddhist monks on the Thai side of the Mekong chanted and provided blessings in a ceremony for the river, which activists from the Freedom Mekong Group says is in danger of dying.\n\n\u201cWhen Xayaburi dam officially generates electricity ... we won\u2019t be able to know how the river will change and how bad it will deteriorate, said activist Montri Chanthawong.\n\nAbout 150 km (90 miles) to the south of Xayaburi, the fishing village of Ban Namprai is having its driest year in living memory.\n\nVillagers say the Mekong is normally at least 3 meters high at the end of the rainy season, when Ban Namprai typically holds dragon boat races, which this year had to be canceled.\n\nFishermen and fish farmers said that since March, when Xayaburi first started testing their turbines, they\u2019ve seen ever-more erratic river flow that can\u2019t be explained just by a drought earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cI think the future of the river is dire. This is just the beginning,\u201d said Ban Nampai\u2019s village chief, Sangtong Siengtid, 45, who is a fisherman himself.\n\n\u201cWith more dams, the once powerful Mekong river will become just a small creek,\u201d he said.\n\nSome fish farmers in the nearby town of Nong Khai have begun moving fish enclosures out of the river and into manmade ponds fed by pumped-in water, said Krit Hemarak, 39, a local fish farm entrepreneur.\n\nXayaburi\u2019s main developers, Thailand\u2019s CK Power PCL , blamed the dried-up patches of riverbed downstream on late monsoon rains and an upstream Chinese dam.\n\nCK Power, a subsidiary of Thai construction company CH. Karnchang Public Company Limited , declined requests for interviews from Reuters and did not respond to written questions.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nIts Facebook page features videos of special 6 billion baht ($200 million) \u201cfish ladders\u201d and sediment gates that CK Power says will ensure the Mekong\u2019s fragile ecosystem of fish migration and the sediment crucial to farming in Vietnam\u2019s Mekong Delta will not be harmed.\n\nThe company will invest in \u201cthe most sustainable manner\u201d, Thanawat Trivisvavet, CK Power\u2019s managing director, said in an article in a local newspaper on Tuesday.\n\nEnvironmental groups say the technology has not been tested.", "description": "The first hydropower dam on the lower Mekong River began commercial operations in Laos on Tuesday amid protests from villagers in Thailand who say the Xayaburi Dam and several others in the works will destroy their livelihoods.", "authors": ["Panu Wongcha-Um", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446185313&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S10H", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
