The major banks paid for the funding guarantees that followed foreign governments\u2019 intervention in markets that had frozen up, adding to federal government revenue coffers.\n\nBanks are leveraged 15-20 times and credit risk assessment is at the heart of a quality bank. When that goes wrong, it is a very slippery slope to the bottom. Money matters but credit counts.\n\nWe should be pleased as a community that our major banks are conservatively run and tend to be risk averse. As a former British chancellor wryly noted, big international banks come home to die. He should know, as the UK government became the major shareholder in those banks: Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Bank.\n\nIncreased competition\n\nSome argue that four major banks is excessive concentration and they should therefore be broken up. Yet many major Australian markets have less than four major players \u2013 supermarkets, airlines and media, to name just a few.\n\nEconomists know that the number of major players is less important for competition than low barriers to entry. It is not easy, nor economically rational, to build a major bank from scratch, but various segments of the banking value chain are now heavily exposed to competition \u2013 in payments, mortgages and personal finance in particular.\n\nThis has been good for consumers, and has forced banks to unwind cross-subsidisation and address lower value products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMajor bank returns on equity have been falling here since 2008 and are now broadly similar to the USA and other markets that have normalised. Bank share prices have plateaued and are well below peak levels. Investors and analysts are expecting reductions in dividends from the sector. Foreign investors are said to be steering clear.\n\nThis background and outlook hardly suggests profiteering and excessive returns.\n\nThe intense focus on mortgage rates is unsurprising in an economy with high household debt.\n\nThe Australian tax system sends powerful signals to households to pursue financial leverage secured by property and hold assets in owner-occupied housing and superannuation.\n\nBanks are the major source of housing finance and fund themselves from a mix of sources, with only a small percentage directly linked to the official cash rate. It is not and never was sound pricing practice to peg the home loan rate to cash rates.\n\nMajor banks\u2019 net interest margins are the true test of banks\u2019 pricing power. The trend is down over both the long and short term, and net interest margins can only fall further if cash rates continue to fall.\n\nBanking in essence is a spread business and deposit margins get progressively squeezed as cash rates fall and the banks\u2019 margin on low or no interest funds reduces. In effect, a bank's net interest margin becomes increasingly dependent on loan rates and less and less on deposit rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is therefore no surprise in the current environment that banks cannot fully pass on cash rate reductions in mortgage loan rates.\n\nWe should remember the wise words of a former RBA governor who, when challenged on bank profitability, said there were countries with unprofitable banks and there were countries with profitable banks. He would much prefer the latter.\n\nAndrew Mohl is a former non-executive director of Commonwealth Bank of Australia and former chief executive of AMP Ltd.", "description": "Banks are neither risk-free utilities nor predators to be broken up.
