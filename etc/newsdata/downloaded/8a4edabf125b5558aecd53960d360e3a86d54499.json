A formal submission must be made to the publisher of the images; when that\u2019s Facebook, your request will be put into a queue by a team of human moderators. \u201cThere\u2019s no machine learning or automation around the publishers\u2019 process,\u201d Bell says.\n\nI\u2019ll be thinking, mate, why did you let a phone anywhere near you when you were doing that?\n\nThis makes requesting removal an ordeal that many victims struggle to face themselves. Bell charges nothing until the offending pictures are gone: a successful erasure campaign costs between $500 and $2500.\n\n\u201cA client will warn us there are some photos of them getting up to something pretty weird. And I\u2019ll be thinking, mate, why did you let a phone anywhere near you when you were doing that?\u201d\n\nRegardless of the answer, Removify is there to help. And it\u2019s helping lift Bell\u2019s net worth from an estimated $170 million in 2018, to $217 million in this year\u2019s Young Rich List placing him in 18th spot on the list.\n\nBell grew up on a sheep and cattle farm at Mount Macedon, north of Melbourne. His first business was selling extra sandwiches and snacks to his schoolmates that he\u2019d convinced his mum to pack. \u201cShe just thought I was hungry,\u201d he says. \"And she made the best lunches.\"\n\nThe natural entrepreneur lasted six weeks in a university business degree, dropping out to take a job in recruitment \u2013 \u201cthat was my apprenticeship in cold-calling\u201d \u2013 before starting a skincare business which he sold out of in 2010.\n\nHe studied the Google playbook and began cold-calling again, promising small businesses he found on the second page of searches that he could get them on to the first. Within a week he had his first paying customer, and WME was born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf they didn\u2019t hang up on me straight away, I knew there was at least a sliver of interest. But you have to show value very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nWhenever he got a business owner to tell him what they were paying someone else per month for SEO, Bell would offer to halve it, and not charge until agreed objectives had been met. He still owns six international WME agencies and wants to be in 50 countries by 2023.\n\nNick Bell sees a big future for Removify in the US, where \"anything goes\" when it comes to defamation. Janie Barrett\n\nAfter the sale of WME in 2017, Bell had planned a year off, but just three weeks in became restless to create a new enterprise. Removify now has 20 employees in Melbourne; offices are set to open in London in October, and Toronto in November. Growth prospects are good.\n\nThe criminalisation of revenge porn in Australia last year means that publishers bound to local laws will usually act on Removify\u2019s takedown requests quickly, Bell says.\n\nMeanwhile, defamation laws in Australia, Britain and Canada help to make malicious reviews vanish. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit like a law firm in our knowledge of the platforms\u2019 review policies.\u201d\n\nBut what if the review is from a genuine customer? In those cases, Removify employs a tactic called \u201csuppression\u201d.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019ve got a guy who was done for tax fraud 10 years ago, he\u2019s trying to rebuild his career and the first result on a search of his name is the Financial Review article on the old court case,\u201d Bell says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll gradually populate page one of the search results on his name with positive or neutral results about him, and push that article onto the second page.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds a bit suspect, Bell feels no need to apologise. \u201cThe internet is an unfair and an unregulated place,\u201d he says. \u201cTo the extent the whole thing\u2019s a game, whoever plays best wins.\u201d\n\nWith Bell claiming revenue had reached $1.5 million a month by its third month in business, Removify would appear to be winning. Indeed, Bell\u2019s just getting started.\n\n\u201cThe US is absolutely anything goes when it comes to defamation, so we think the suppression business there could be huge.\u201d\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
