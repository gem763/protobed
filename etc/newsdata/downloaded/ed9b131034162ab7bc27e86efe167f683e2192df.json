When I met Olympia, I plunged into her eyes and not into her family tree. Afterwards we were able to smile at this historical coincidence.'\n\nFollowers of the Bonapartist movement see Jean-Christophe as a kind of French hero, in a time when the country is losing faith in modern politicians.\n\nBonapartists view Jean-Christophe as the head of the former Imperial House Of France.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte's stormy marriage to Austrian Archduchess Marie-Louise who was 22 years his junior and had not met him before the wedding Napoelon met widowed mother-of-two Marie Jos\u00e8phe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie in September 1795, who was six years his senior, and was instantly smitten. They married in March 1796, making her Empress Jos\u00e9phine, the first Empress of France. Jean-Christophe's great great grand uncle is Napoleon I, who married Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria to secure an ally of the country when fighting Britain and the Russians Their relationship was stormy and in 1810, he divorced her after she failed to produce an heir, in favour of Marie Louise, 18, daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria. Archduchess Marie Louise was not happy about the union with a man 22 years her senior, who she had never met. Her great-aunt Marie Antoinette had also been executed while she was Queen of France, and she feared for her own fate. However, she had to bow to her father's will, and the couple were married by proxy in a religious ceremony on March 11, 1810, which Napoleon did not attend. Marie Louise had grown up against a background of continuous conflict between Austria and revolutionary France, and her home country had suffered a series of heavy defeats. In 1809, the year before their wedding Austria and Britain were engaged in the War of the Fifth Coalition against France and Bavaria, which ended in favour of the French at the Battle of Wagram in July. The resulting Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn led to Austria losing more then three million subjects, after ceding territory to France and Bavaria. However, the marriage of Napoleon and Marie Louise in 1810, signalled a temporary peace between Austria and the French Empire. Despite her initial misgivings, Marie-Louise seemed to warm to Napoleon after the wedding, and became an obedient wife. Napoleon meanwhile compared the shy and timid girl to his former wife Josephine, who was passionate and outgoing. The pair remained in close contact, which upset Marie-Louise. She gave birth to a son in 1811, Napol\u00e9on Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Charles Bonaparte, and was a devoted mother. In 1813, Prussia and the UK joined Russia in declaring war on France, but Austria remained neutral due to the connection between the Imperial families. As Napoleon set to battle in Germany, Marie-Louise was appointed Regent and, though she tried to convince her father to ally with France, Austria soon joined the opposition. In January 1814, Marie-Louise saw Napoleon ride off into battle for the last time, as he attempted to stave off the Allied invasion in the north of the country. Three months later, at the instigation of Talleryrand, the Senate announced the deposition of the Emperor and Napoleon abdicated. While he was exiled to Elba, Marie-Louise retained her imperial rank and title, becoming ruler of the duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, with her son as heir. She was dissuaded from contacting her husband, who was said to be distraught over the death of his ex-wife, Josephine. When Napoleon escaped in 1815 and reinstated his rule, Marie-Louise was asked by her stepmother to pray for the success of the Austrian armies, but rejected this. Later that year, when he was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to Saint Helena, he made no attempt to contact his wife. Napoleon died on 5 May 1821 having suffered a hard life in exile, and Marie-Louise went on to marry Count Adam Albert von Neipperg on 8 August, whom she had three children with. She fell ill on 9 December 1846, with her condition quickly worsening, and died on December 17.\n\nThe family history that has led to the historic union between Countess Olympia and Jean-Christophe Prince Napoleon. Jean Cristophe is the great-great-nephew of Napoleon\n\nIndeed, his own grandfather Louis, Prince Napol\u00e9on, said in his will that he wanted his grandson, then 11, to succeed him as head of the Imperial House, after falling out with his son, Charles, for embracing republican principles and re-marrying without his permission.\n\nJean-Cristophe has played an influential role in public affairs, appearing alongside the royals of European countries such as Belgium and The Netherlands at official engagements, such as the anniversaries of the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nThe bride has a degree in Political Science from Yale, and is believed to have met her fianc\u00e9 while spending a semester in Paris.\n\nThe couple married at Les Invalides, where Napoleon's body was brought back from St Helena after his exile from France.\n\nJean-Christophe told the French newspaper Le Figaro that their marriage was 'the fruit of European reconciliation and construction, which I believe in enormously'.\n\nPrincess Beatrice started dating the Italian property developer, 36, who is a father-of-one, in October last year. His powder-blue waistcoat matched the Princess's coat\n\nHe went on to say he felt a deep commitment and sense of duty to France, and that he was keen to honour the legacy of his ancestors.\n\nHe said: 'The Bonapartes have always been modern men in the avant-garde and helping their era to move forward, and figures who have built their own lives with an extraordinary freedom.\n\n'I firmly intend to pursue my heritage in this direction.'\n\nThe bride beamed as she arrived for her wedding. Her demure gown had a long cape that cascaded over her shoulders and into a train\n\nLook of love: The couple look thrilled as they celebrate their wedding. Louis, Prince Napol\u00e9on, said in his will that he wanted Jean-Christophe, then 11, to succeed him as head of the Imperial House\n\nThe couple are greeted with applause as they leave the cathedral. Jean-Christophe told the French newspaper Le Figaro that their marriage was 'the fruit of European reconciliation and construction, which I believe in enormously'\n\nPortrait of Napoleon I (1769-1821) and Archduchess Marie Louise with their son, the King of Rome, Napoleon II, Duke of Reichstadt in the Tuileries Gardens\n\nNapoleon married Archduchess Marie-Louise, a niece of Marie Antoinette, in 1810 after divorcing his wife Josephine, when she failed to produce an heir.\n\nNapoleon's only son died young, leaving his sole successor Napoleon III, who ruled France between 1848 and 1870. Napoleon III was Jean-Christophe's great-great grandfather.\n\nThe modern-day Bonaparte has insisted that echoes of the past in the French-Austrian alliance with his wife-to-be are purely coincidental.", "description": "Jean-Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte, 33, wed Countess Olympia von und zu Arco-Zinnerberg, 31, in Paris yesterday.
