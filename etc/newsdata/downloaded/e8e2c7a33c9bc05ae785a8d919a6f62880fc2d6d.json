Household finances are under pressure \u2013 earlier this year the Resolution Foundation thinktank described it as \u201can unprecedented income squeeze over the past decade\u201d. Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, agrees: \u201cThere are people in this country who have less income than their minimum outgoings, and that is a real crisis,\u201d he says. However, part of it may also be an attitude problem: the NatWest survey found that those earning over \u00a390,000 were just as likely not to put anything away. So, if you have money coming in and a potential to free up cash, how can you get into the savings habit? Lewis has some tips.\n\nLook at your debt first\n\n\n\nIf you have expensive debts, it\u2019s better to clear them than to save. If you are debt-free except for your mortgage, the interest rate on that will probably be higher than savings rates, so you should consider overpaying your mortgage, although I would like to see a minimum of three months\u2019 worth of bills put aside.\n\nAnalyse what you spend\n\n\n\nSit down with three months\u2019 worth of bank and credit-card statements, factor in Christmas and other expenses. Make sure you are not overpaying your gas and electricity bills, you\u2019re getting the best deals on things like your digital TV, and work out your necessary expenditure. Look at your discretionary spending \u2013 that \u00a33 coffee every working day is \u00a3750 a year. Set up different accounts, and as soon as you get paid, put money away \u2013 but manage your cash so you don\u2019t go overdrawn, because that defeats the point. You can start to learn what spare money you really have, and start to discipline yourself. We are very unrestrained when we don\u2019t have a budget.\n\nThe Money Saving Expert: how Martin Lewis became the most trusted man in Britain Read more\n\nLook for the best-paying savings account\n\n\n\nThe minimum anybody should be earning on savings right now is 1.45%, which is the rate of the top easy-access account. There are ways to earn more, such as locking money away. If you are young and saving for a property, open a Lifetime ISA, which will give you a 25% boost. For those people on a low income, the government has a Help to Save scheme \u2013 I was worried it would encourage people to keep money in savings when they should be clearing their debts, but it\u2019s a clever scheme.\n\nGet into the right mindset\n\n\n\nIf you are able to free up some cash, saving is about a mindset change. Some people like a challenge \u2013 put a penny aside on the first day, 2p on the second day, 3p on the third. Anything that gets you into the habit is worthwhile. For younger people, if you\u2019re lucky enough to get a pay rise, put a quarter of it into savings straight away, because once we get used to having more money, we find it very difficult to have less. It\u2019s a difficult time to save at the moment because interest rates are so low, but anything you can do break your habitual pattern, and start to put money aside \u2013 if your finances have room \u2013 will be helpful.", "description": "As incomes are squeezed and millions of Britons put nothing aside, the savings expert explains how best to build a healthy bank account", "authors": ["Emine Saner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab3bbf4986cdb5eedebd11c9ed4b75e2cc7da78/953_969_2526_1515/master/2526.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cae4ecf580c349460b50b2f01f20db72", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
