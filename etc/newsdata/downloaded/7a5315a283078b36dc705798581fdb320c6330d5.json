The United Nations said 100,000 people had fled their homes.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Turkey's Defence Ministry said that 415 YPG militants had been \"neutralised\" since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed.\n\nISLAMIC STATE\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with the Kurdish YPG as its main fighting element, now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State's \"caliphate\" in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe Kurdish militia say the Turkish assault could allow the jihadist group to re-emerge as some of its followers were escaping from prisons.\n\nIn its first big attack since the assault began on Tuesday, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area, even as the city came under Turkish shelling.\n\nFive Islamic State fighters fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the SDF said.\n\nU.S. lawmakers introduced more legislation on Friday seeking stiff sanctions on Turkey over the offensive, underscoring unhappiness from both Democrats and President Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress over his Syria policy.\n\nU.S. military officials denied lawmakers' accusations that the Trump administration had abandoned U.S. allies to a Turkish military onslaught. Ankara says it aims to defeat the YPG, which it sees as an enemy for its links to militants who have fought a decades-old insurgency in Turkey.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump had authorized the drafting of \"very significant\" new sanctions against Turkey, a NATO ally. Washington was not activating the curbs now but would do so if necessary, Mnuchin said.\n\nTurkey aims to set up a \"safe zone\" inside Syria, where it can resettle many of the 3.6 million refugees it has been hosting. Erdogan threatened to send refugees to Europe if the European Union did not back his assault, prompting a furious response from the EU.\n\nFor a graphic on 'Where Kurds live', click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/SYRIA-SECURITY-TURKEY-USA/0H001QXBW8SM/KURDS.jpg\n\nFor a graphic on 'Turkey hits Kurdish militia targets', click https://graphics.reuters.com/SYRIA-SECURITY-TURKEY-USA/0100B2G11PV/index.html\n\n(Reporting by Daren Butler and Reuters correspondents in the region; Editing by Angus MacSwan)", "description": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish forces stepped up their bombardment around a town in northeast Syria on Saturday, the fourth day of an offensive against a Kurdish militia, after U.S. troops in the region came under artillery fire from Turkish positions.", "authors": ["Daren Butler"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
