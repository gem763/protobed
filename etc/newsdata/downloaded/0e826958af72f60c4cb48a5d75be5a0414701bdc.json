Did you ace your chemistry and physics classes in high school? Do you dream of wearing a lab coat to work?\n\nIf so, you might have a thing for science.\n\nTo find the top 12 jobs for science lovers, we used data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), a US Department of Labor database full of detailed information on almost 1,000 occupations.\n\nOne of the many things O*NET analyzes is how important science is to each of the 974 jobs in its database. We focused on jobs where science had an \"importance\" rating of 81 or higher.\n\nWe then used the BLS data to look for the median annual pay for jobs, which was last reported in 2018. We also listed the projected job openings (openings due to growth and replacement) from 2016-2026.\n\nFinally, we made sure to note which jobs were labeled as \"green occupations,\" meaning that they will likely evolve as a result of the green economy, which is influencing the demand of scientists in the field. Any \"green occupation\" is likely going to have an increased employment demand in the years to come.\n\nAs it turns out, most of these science-heavy gigs pay fairly well \u2014 but this doesn't come as a surprise, given that almost every occupation on the list requires an advanced degree (and all 12 require at least a bachelor's).\n\nSo, if you love science and you're willing to go the extra mile in your education, you may want to consider the following professions:\n\nNatalie Walters contributed to a previous version of this article.", "description": "Do you consider yourself a science geek?
