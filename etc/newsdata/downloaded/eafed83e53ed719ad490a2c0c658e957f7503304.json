So begins homework, tests, and required readings.\n\nNow that you\u2019re in back-to-school mode, it could be a good time to check out some of our favorite books about investing.\n\nLearning about financial concepts can feel intimidating. Even finding a starting spot can prove challenging. If you search for an investment term on the Internet, you often end up with an alphabet soup of complex financial terms.\n\nA better entry point can be picking up a book by an expert who thoughtfully and sequentially presents and explains financial concepts and investing topics. Resources like these can help you realize investing doesn\u2019t have to be intimidating or complicated. Here are five books that are great places to get started.\n\nThe Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing by Benjamin Graham\n\nBenjamin Graham is known as the father of value investing. He taught Warren Buffett, a modern investing icon. His book lays a framework for evaluating a business\u2019s worth based on financial value, not short-term trading techniques. In his book, Graham defined many important investing concepts such as \"margin of safety,\" which is an important input in the Morningstar Rating for Stocks.\n\nThe revised edition includes commentary on every chapter from Wall Street Journal personal-finance columnist Jason Zweig, which contextualizes and modernizes the text. With Zweig\u2019s commentary, the book is north of 500 pages, which is a lot; however, it\u2019s a thorough introduction to investing. If getting through means skimming a few chapters, no judgment here.\n\nA Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing by Burton Malkiel\n\nIf Graham teaches you how to evaluate a business, Burton Malkiel explains why that might not help you. The Princeton economist argues that markets demonstrate efficiency because people are analyzing a company\u2019s value. (Efficiency means a company\u2019s share price reflects its current worth, and its price will change when new information alters a business\u2019s worth.) Malkiel recommends earning the market\u2019s return instead of beating it, which he compellingly argues is good enough.\n\nThe book was first published in 1973, but updated editions have added contemporary topics. These include exchange-traded funds and investment techniques like smart beta (which Morningstar prefers to call \"strategic beta,\" but I digress).\n\nThe Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns by John Bogle\n\nInvesting icon John Bogle passed away early this year, but he leaves behind an impressive legacy: He revolutionized the mutual fund industry and was a tireless advocate for investors. He pioneered the index fund, which allowed investors to gain diversified exposure to the stock market at a very low cost, which has helped investors keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets. His book explains why low fees significantly affect returns. It also addresses topics like mean-reversion and tax costs.\n\nThe text is accessible and shorter than many other investing books, and it includes quotes from many prominent financial figures that support Bogle\u2019s claims.\n\nMorningstar\u2019s 30-Minute Money Solutions by Christine Benz\n\nEven if you understand investing basics, you might struggle to incorporate them into your personal finances. Executing them in manageable steps can prove even more challenging.\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of Christine Benz\u2019s \u201cMorningstar\u2019s 30-Minute Money Solutions.\u201d Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance, breaks financial planning down into bite-size chunks that anyone can handle. You start with basics like assessing your net worth and creating an organization system, and you progressively conquer more advanced topics including retirement investing, college savings, and estate planning.\n\nIf you want to meld investment basics with tangible advice, this book is a great option.\n\nThe Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America by Warren Buffett\n\nMany consider Warren Buffett the best modern investor. He has risen to fame as Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s CEO, a position he\u2019s held for over 50 years. Berkshire Hathaway invests in high-quality businesses with strong growth potential. But Buffett only buys such companies when they're selling at an attractive margin of safety (hat tip to his mentor, Benjamin Graham). This makes Buffett an extreme stock-picker. Under his reign, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s growth has far surpassed that of the S&P 500, a testament to his approach\u2019s success.\n\n\n\nEach year, Buffett writes an annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, but all of them are published on Berkshire Hathaway's website so anyone can read them. Buffett writes in a straightforward style that is accessible to investors of all skill levels, and he's often very funny to boot. \u201cThe Essays of Warren Buffett\u201d weaves together Buffett\u2019s essays into a sequential, cohesive book.\n\nIntroducing Morningstar's New Podcast: The Long View\n\nExpand your investing horizons and look to the long term.
