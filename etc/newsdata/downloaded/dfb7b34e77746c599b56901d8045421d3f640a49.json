Cormier was on commentary duties making the call as it all unfolded.\n\nThe pre- and post-fight talk around the contest was that it had the potential to serve as a title eliminator at 205 pounds. Jones (25-1 MMA, 19-1 UFC) does not currently have a fight booked, and Reyes made his statement inside the octagon. Cormier, who is a noted rival of Jones and a former champion of the weight class, endorses the pairing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good matchup,\u201d Cormier said during the UFC on ESPN 6 broadcast on ESPN2. \u201cDominick Reyes has a good body. He showed he can stop takedowns. I think it will be a great fight between those two. I believe this kid is the real deal. He\u2019s done everything right up to this point. I\u2019m really impressed with Dominick Reyes.\u201d\n\nReyes called his shot at Jones post-fight, arguing that he is the most deserving of all potential challengers for \u201cBones.\u201d Cormier agrees, citing Reyes\u2019 size as an X-factor that could make the matchup a true challenge for one of the most dominant fighters in the sport.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s healthy after that big fight and Jones just got through his most recent court problems or whatever it was \u2013 so why not let him fight?\u201d Cormier said. \u201c(Reyes) has the one key thing that has proven to give Jones pause, and that\u2019s size.\u201d\n\nGallery Dominick Reyes def.
