After all, they were both U.S. citizens; their names were on her birth certificate; her older brother, Lev\u2014who like Kessem was born in Canada with the help of an egg donor and a gestational surrogate\u2014had no problem obtaining his own U.S. passport when he was born in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe sort of naively thought that this is just a big mistake\u2014that once the government realized, perhaps through media, that this was a mistake, it would be sort of rectified, clarified,\u201d Roee told The Daily Beast. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve started hearing from others who are in similar situations.\u201d\n\nThe Kivitis soon realized that the State Department\u2019s refusal to recognize Kessem as a U.S. citizen from birth was no mistake, but the result of a government policy that considers her, as a child born abroad to same-sex parents via assisted reproductive technology, as born \u201cout of wedlock.\u201d The policy effectively invalidates her fathers\u2019 marriage in the eyes of the State Department\u2014and threatens to split the young family apart.\n\n\u201cThe scenario that we are now in doesn\u2019t allow us, in the long run, to live in the U.S. as a family,\u201d Adiel told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about two parents who are American citizens, an older brother who is an American citizen, and a newborn who is not an American citizen. If this is not going to get resolved, I mean, we have to leave the United States.\u201d\n\nNow, the Kivitis are taking on the State Department to keep their family together.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in federal district court on Thursday morning, the Kivitis are seeking the recognition of Kessem\u2019s birthright citizenship of the United States\u2014and a judgment declaring the State Department\u2019s policy as both unconstitutional and a violation of federal immigration law.\n\n\u201cThis is a fight for marriage equality; this is a fight for the fundamental right to citizenship,\u201d said Aaron Morris, executive director of LGBTQ-focused legal nonprofit Immigration Equality, which filed the suit along with Lambda Legal and the powerhouse firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. \u201cAnd denying a little girl citizenship just because she happens to have two gay dads is intolerable.\u201d\n\nAt issue in the complaint, the fourth such case seeking to end the State Department\u2019s policy, is the department\u2019s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which sets the legal standard for U.S. birthright citizenship eligibility. Beginning in 2014, the State Department began interpreting the act to mean that a child born abroad \u201cmust be biologically related to a U.S. citizen parent,\u201d according to the State Department\u2019s website.\n\nFurthermore, children born abroad via assisted reproductive technology like gestational surrogacy or sperm donation are considered to have been born \u201cout of wedlock,\u201d even if their parents\u2014like the Kivitis\u2014are legally married U.S. citizens.\n\nThe hurdles for birthright citizenship eligibility are much higher for children born out of wedlock, and include DNA tests, testimony that the parents are financially able to support the child, and strict parental residency requirements that would disqualify Kessem because Adiel, her biological parent, has lived in the United States for just shy of the required five years. (Both Roee and Adiel were born in Israel, but Roee primarily grew up in California and was naturalized in 2001.)\n\nAfter The Daily Beast first reported the Kivitis\u2019 story in May, the State Department\u2019s policy faced heavy criticism, ranging from the entire Democratic presidential field and nearly 100 members of Congress to Hollywood celebrities. Sources close to Ivanka Trump told The Daily Beast that even she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the policy at the time.\n\nNevertheless, the State Department has continued to defend the policy in court. The Kiviti\u2019s case is the fourth such suit filed by Immigration Equality, which already won an early victory in February when a district court judge called the basis for the policy \u201cstrained.\u201d But the administration appealed that decision and sought to have another lawsuit thrown out\u2014indicating the State Department\u2019s willingness to take the fight as far as it can.\n\nImmigration Equality, Morris said, is more than ready to wage a war of legal attrition.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that if they keep losing cases, they will voluntarily take it upon themselves to change their policy,\u201d Morris said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how many times a district court needs to tell them that they\u2019re contrary to the will of Congress and the law, but we will bring suits until and unless they change the policy.\u201d\n\nBut beyond the strategic decision to file four different cases, Morris said, are the individual stories of families who face being separated from their young children due to the State Department\u2019s extra-textual interpretation of immigration law.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to have this little girl declared to be a citizen,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf not, she will be undocumented in the United States after this weekend. So the first really is a very practical, family-based, justice necessity.\u201d\n\nOmar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior attorney at Lambda Legal, agreed, telling The Daily Beast that ultimately, \u201cthese cases are about real people and real families.\u201d\n\n\u201cKids who are being denied their citizenship, and parents who are denied their ability to care for their children in the best way,\u201d Gonzalez-Pagan said. \u201cIn every single one of these cases, all that they want is to stand up and protect their children. First and foremost, that\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing multiple cases.\u201d\n\nThe State Department\u2019s functional dismissal of the Kivitis\u2019 marriage, Gonzalez-Pagan added, is part of a larger tapestry of discriminatory policies that the Trump administration has crafted, strengthened or defended\u2014combining President Donald Trump\u2019s long-professed hostility towards birthright citizenship with his administration\u2019s track record of dismantling legal protections for LGBT people.\n\n\u201cThis administration has shown a disdain to anybody who they view as an \u2018other\u2019 or an \u2018undesirable,\u2019\u201d Gonzalez-Pagan told The Daily Beast. \u201cThey have sought to limit access to citizenship, they have sought to limit immigration, and they have sought to limit the rights of LGBTQ people. I think this is just an area in which those two veins of discrimination in this administration have intwined.\u201d\n\nFor the Kivitis, the question of the policy\u2019s intentions is less important than its affect on same-sex parents and their children.\n\n\u201cThis is about singling out LGBT Americans\u2014this is about telling gay and lesbian parents, \u2018OK, you got marriage, but we know that you\u2019re different. We know that you are not like us, and we\u2019re going to treat you differently,\u2019\u201d Roee said. \u201cToday it\u2019s our family\u2014tomorrow it\u2019s going to be someone else\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nStill, the decision to join a nationwide legal battle to dismantle the policy was not an easy one\u2014particularly with two small children at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a trivial decision\u2014like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go to the courts! And have this legal battle! And go to the media!\u2019 No, no, no. If it was up to us, we would much enjoy having, like, a normal life with a bigger family,\u201d Adiel said. \u201cWe have no other choice but to fight for justice for Kessem.\u201d", "description": "Two dads are taking on the State Department to keep their family together\u2014and to validate their daughter\u2019s U.S. citizenship in federal court.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568264803/190912-bixby-lgbt-baby-citizenship-hero_xg8csg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
