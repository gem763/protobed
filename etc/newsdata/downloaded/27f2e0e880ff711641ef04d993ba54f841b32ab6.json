Organisers and police gave differing numbers for those taking part, but the Australian Broadcasting Corp said 180,000 would be a conservative estimate of participants nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe oceans are rising and so are we,\u201d read one sign held by a protester wearing school uniform in Melbourne.\n\nBy mid-morning across Europe and Africa, crowds had gathered in many cities, including London, Berlin, Warsaw and Nairobi.\n\n\u201cWe are skipping our lessons to teach you one,\u201d read a placard carried by a student in London.\n\nThe protesters are calling on governments to take immediate action to limit the harmful effects of manmade climate change.\n\nThe strike will culminate in New York when Thunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her climate activism, will spearhead a rally at the United Nations headquarters.\n\nDanielle Porepilliasana, a Sydney high school student, had a blunt message for politicians such as Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, who told parliament on Thursday that students should stay in class.\n\n\u201cWorld leaders from everywhere are telling us that students need to be at school doing work,\u201d she said, wearing anti-coal earrings. \u201cI\u2019d like to see them at their parliaments doing their jobs for once.\u201d\n\nCARBON EMISSIONS\n\nGlobal warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heatwaves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say.\n\nCarbon emissions climbed to a record high last year, despite a warning from the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases must be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilise the climate.\n\nClimate change protesters are seen crossing the Victoria Bridge during the Global Strike 4 Climate rally in Brisbane, Australia, September 20, 2019. AAP Image/Darren England/via REUTERS\n\nOrganisers said demonstrations would take different forms around the world, but all aim to promote awareness of climate change and demand political action to curb contributing factors.\n\nThe protest movement is putting increasing pressure on both governments and companies to respond.\n\nOnline retail giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) pledged on Thursday it would be net carbon neutral by 2040 and would buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from a start-up firm.\n\nCutting emissions is a challenging goal for Amazon, which delivers 10 billion items a year and has a massive transport and data centre footprint. \u201cWe know we can do it and we know we have to do it,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said.\n\nEnvironmental advocacy group Greenpeace USA welcomed the commitment, but a spokesman said the company lagged peers Google (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Facebook (FB.O) in transparency around its renewable projects.\n\nSome of the company\u2019s workers from the group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice plan to join marches on Friday.\n\nIn Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was due to unveil a major new climate protection package thrashed out by parties in her coalition in all-night talks. Meanwhile, on the streets of the capital, crowds gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, where three activists stood on blocks of ice beneath a mock gallows.\n\nFOSSIL FUELS\n\nThe U.N. summit brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels.\n\nThe issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.\n\nAs Friday\u2019s day of action got underway across scattered Pacific communities, students holding placards in Kiribati chanted: \u201cWe are not sinking, we are fighting\u201d. Children in the Solomon Islands rallied on the shoreline wearing traditional grass skirts and carrying wooden shields.\n\nHours later in Thailand, more than 200 young people stormed the Environment Ministry and dropped to the ground feigning death.\n\n\u201cThis is what will happen if we don\u2019t stop climate change now,\u201d said 21-year-old strike organiser Nanticha Ocharoenchai.\n\nIn Kenya, around 500 activists marched through the streets demanding that the government cancel plans for a coal plant and investigate corruption in hydropower dams.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\n\u201cIn Samburu there is a lot of heat, the grass has dried up, there is little water,\u201d said Francis Lentel, a young herdsman in traditional beads, holding a picture of the earth weeping.\n\nIn India\u2019s financial capital Mumbai, battered this year by a heavier-than-usual monsoon that caused flooding, children from at least 10 schools joined protests throughout the day.\n\nChildren in the eastern city of Kolkata handed out flyers at busy bus terminals. \u201cThis is the only planet we have,\u201d one of the children said.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of students, office workers and other protesters took to the streets across the globe on Friday to demand urgent action to avert an environmental catastrophe from world leaders gathering for a U.N. climate summit.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431987946&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0CS", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
