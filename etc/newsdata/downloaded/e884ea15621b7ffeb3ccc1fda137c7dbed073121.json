Should he survive impeachment, however Sen. Elizabeth Warren is the opponent he should be worried about most.\n\nSurging in the polls, the Massachusetts Democrat best speaks to the trials of Americans who came of age in this century and educated women \u2014 groups whose voting numbers are growing. Much as Trump tapped displaced blue-collar workers and their offspring in smaller cities and rural areas often dependent on manufacturing\u2014a cohort receding in importance as many skill-up and migrate to metropoles offering better job opportunities.\n\nThat new economy\u2014so often defined by computers, robots and artificial intelligence\u2014has fundamentally altered the challenges workers face.\n\nIn the 19th century, farming and services that supported agriculture were the primary occupation. Freeholders and tenant farmers alike relied on their own resourcefulness and knowledge of weather, planting techniques and luck to squeeze a living out of the land. Men and women passed down the ethic of self-reliance and critical skills to sons and daughters\u2014prior to the New Deal they had little backstop from the government or large corporations to buffer them in hard times.\n\nThe mechanization of agriculture consolidated farms and released workers to cities where the mass- production factory\u2014and commercial enterprises modeled after it\u2014demanded workers conform to practices dictated by engineers and professional managers.\n\nHenry Ford\u2014doubling workers\u2019 pay and then introducing the 40-hour week in 1926\u2014offered workers a bargain. Follow directions and you can live well and enjoy weekends off. The New Deal and union movement generalized that to many more workers\u2014through contracts or just raising worker and employer expectations. Health and old-age pension benefits followed.\n\nThrough about 1960, many workers lacked even a high school diploma and were socialized to the notion that conformity would deliver security.\n\nAutomation, globalization and now artificial intelligence shattered all that, and workers in the digital economy increasingly are left to shift for themselves. Many can lose employment or clients in a whim and have inadequate retirement savings.\n\nTrump behaves as if the world has not changed\u2014tariffs on China cannot bring back most factory jobs with steady benefits, because most simply move elsewhere in Asia. And bullying GM, GM, -0.28% , for example, to open new plants to replace those recently slated to be closed, is not a jobs\u2019 policy.\n\nThe Democratic Party base is growing because it addresses these problems\u2014though it often harkens to solutions that have failed in the past. Higher education is essential, but free tuition and loan forgiveness don\u2019t target the essential problem\u2014given unrestrained access to government and student loan money, universities irresponsibly boost tuition, spawn bureaucracies, and don\u2019t deliver enough adequately skilled graduates.\n\nObamacare did not solve the problem of monopoly pricing and soaring costs, but Nancy Pelosi\u2019s prescription drug plan, for example, still falls short of the kind of thoughtful regulatory regime the Germans use to facilitate new drugs without price gouging.\n\nSocial Security is underfunded. Democrats propose to raise taxes, not raise the retirement age and not address the most fundamental problem\u2014the trust fund is invested in low-yielding federal bonds instead of stocks, which outperform.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell leads the Party of No. That leaves policy innovation to Democrats who score points by proposing prohibitively expensive socialist solutions.\n\nWarren is skilled at identifying pressure points, blaming a villain\u2014greedy corporations and corrupt government\u2014and offering high-sounding, undeliverable promises. For example, the president has no power to break up large corporations as antitrust policy is a matter of law and ultimately officiated by the courts. Independent analyses indicate her wealth tax would hardly generate the revenue she claims.\n\nStill solutions sound plausible to young folks and suburban women, because Europe has very inexpensive or government-paid health care, higher education and the like.\n\nEurope also has heavy regulation, terribly slow growth and high youth unemployment, and the typical worker forks over about half his pay in taxes. If French malaise and Yellow Vest unrest is the future Americans want\u2014she\u2019s the ideal successor to Trump.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MarketWatch.", "description": "President Donald Trump appears obsessed about getting something on former .10/14/2019 19:18:31PM EST.", "authors": ["Peter Morici", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/587e93a3-a028-400f-bbc0-d33887cfe1ad.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
