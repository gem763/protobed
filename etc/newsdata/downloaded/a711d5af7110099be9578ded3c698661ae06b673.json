In all, the power will be cut to portions of 17 counties. The outages will last about 48 hours, the utility said.\n\nThe Santa Rosa fire department tweeted that shutoffs had started in the city and it was getting multiple reports of outages.\n\nCalifornia power shutoffs: when your public utility is owned by private investors Read more\n\nMeanwhile, Southern California Edison said it could cut power on Thursday to more than 308,000 customers in seven counties and San Diego Gas & Electric is warning of power shutoffs to about 24,000 customers.\n\nThe utilities said they were concerned that winds forecast to top 60mph (97km/h) could throw branches and debris into power lines or topple them, sparking wildfires.\n\nPG&E cut power to more than 2 million people across California in rolling blackouts earlier this month, the largest deliberate blackout to prevent wildfires in state history. The shutoffs caused schools to close and many businesses to shutter. Residents complained PG&E communicated late and ineffectively, even failing to keep its website running smoothly during the outages.\n\nThe utility \u2013 the largest in the United States - declared bankruptcy in January, in part because of potential liabilities from its role in some of the 2017 northern California fires and the 2018 Camp fire.\n\nExperts and authorities are warning that shutoffs may be the new normal in the state amid a deepening climate crisis. \u201cThere were bad fires in the 20th century, but more or less, there was a power system that worked,\u201d Michael Wara, the director of the Climate and Energy Policy program at Stanford University, told the Guardian last month. \u201cI think what\u2019s different is the weather extremes are much more extreme and that\u2019s a predictable effect of climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not panic per se, just, \u2018Eh, we gotta do this again?\u2019\u201d said Kim Schefer, the manager of Village True Value Hardware in Santa Rosa.\n\nSchefer directed customers to gas cans and batteries as they prepared for what many see as a costly, frustrating new routine.\n\nThe California governor, Gavin Newsom, sent a sharply worded letter on Tuesday to Bill Johnson, PG&E CEO, blaming the unprecedented mass outage earlier this month on the company\u2019s failure to maintain and upgrade its equipment. State rules leave utilities to control when they will shut down the power, and how they will choose to do it.\n\nPG&E says the shutdowns are not about money.\n\nThe only goal \u201cis to prevent a catastrophic wildfire\u201d, Johnson said in a Tuesday briefing.", "description": "Pacific Gas & Electric says the latest shutoffs will affect nearly half a million people across the state", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bffba7cd7d53a8be82deeb28b6a5e7ef3aa6ffa0/0_192_5374_3224/master/5374.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aaf7e8492ade8fa4e2ba3ed7329ec712", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
