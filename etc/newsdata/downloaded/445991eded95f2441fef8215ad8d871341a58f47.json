She\u2019d then zip down to Westchester County to accept an award, and the following morning she'd hairpin turn back to the state\u2019s northernmost border to fish at the 2019 Adirondack Challenge on Saranac Lake.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut that wasn't enough. She wondered aloud to an aide if she could \"bang out\" a visit somewhere in Washington County on the way to the North Country. The aide nodded helplessly.\n\nDoesn\u2019t Kathy Hochul ever get tired?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do tired,\u201d she said in an interview with POLITICO. \u201cI don\u2019t want any downtime. I don\u2019t need it.\"\n\nSuch is the hectic life of New York\u2019s lieutenant governor, who seems to be a presence at every ribbon-cutting, baby-kissing, axe-throwing event the state has to offer. \u201cI would say she\u2019s been busier than any lieutenant governor in recent memory by far,\u201d said Robert Bellafiore, an Albany-based communications consultant and a former press secretary for Gov. George Pataki.\n\nNaturally enough, all those cut ribbons, kissed babies and thrown axes lead to a simple question: To what end?\n\nWhile Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s national ambitions are a constant source of speculation in Albany, his second-in-command is rarely mentioned in conversations about the state's political stars.\n\nPerhaps she should be, because even as she operates in the formidable shadow of the governor, she has been independently carving out a place for herself and whatever ambitions she may have in every corner of the state.\n\nHer travels certainly have the trappings of a would-be candidate building a profile for some future bid for another office, perhaps the one her boss currently occupies. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a lieutenant governor who hasn\u2019t wanted to be governor at some point,\u201d said Democratic strategist Bruce Gyory.\n\nPrecedent, though, is not on her side. Except for Cuomo\u2019s father Mario, and Herbert Lehman, there\u2019s not a strong history of lieutenant governors advancing to the state\u2019s highest office in recent times \u2014 at least not on purpose. Or to any other office, for that matter.\n\nBut precedent and history have not dampened Hochul's enthusiasm for tending to her web of connections. Her aides said she\u2019ll speak most anyplace she\u2019s invited, far exceeding assignments from Cuomo's office. She often requests additional appearances to revisit projects she helped launch or that meet her goal of hitting all 62 counties every year.\n\nA group of physicists working on synchrotron radiation instrumentation? Sure.\n\nThe AppleUmpkin Festival in Wyoming County, where there are famously more cows than people? Of course.\n\nA new brewery? A coworking space in a beleaguered downtown corridor? Anything \u2014 literally anything \u2014 aimed at advancing women in the workplace? Absolutely.\n\n\u201cSo I just look at a day like, OK, we're going here, but why don't we go see a senior center while we\u2019re there or go see a homeless center and talk to them?\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can be in a place to make an official announcement and build out five of those things on the way, that's a better day for me.\u201d\n\nLieutenant governors don't have a particularly burdensome job description. Onetime lieutenant governor David Paterson reportedly joked that his only responsibility each day was to call the Executive Mansion and ask if Gov. Eliot Spitzer was still in office. (And wouldn\u2019t you know \u2014 a day came when Spitzer was not, in fact, in office, and Paterson earned a promotion.) Paterson\u2019s own No. 2, Richard Ravitch, said he didn\u2019t feel he accomplished \u201canything very substantive\u201d during his time in office. Mario Cuomo\u2019s first lieutenant governor, Alfred DelBello, famously resigned after two years, complaining that he was bored.\n\nThe current Cuomo's first lieutenant governor, Bob Duffy, said his position had specific emphasis on economic development, which prepared him for the gig he has now, head of Rochester's Chamber of Commerce. Duffy said he considered himself a means of support and reconnaissance, while Hochul seems to be choosing a more \u201cvisible\u201d path.\n\n\"I saw my role as being his eyes and ears upstate,\" Duffy said. \"I traveled around to meet with constituents and leaders, listen to their concerns, establish relationships and report back to the governor.\"\n\nDuffy stepped down after Cuomo's first term, in part because the heavy travel requirements placed unmanageable stress on his 6-foot, 5-inch frame.\n\nHochul, who is more than a foot shorter than Duffy, has less difficulty finding legroom, though she uses foam lumbar supports and a device that shoots tiny electric pulses into her back to support hours of sitting in a car \u2014 her preferred mode of transport. She almost never flies, except for fast trips between Buffalo and New York City.\n\n\"There\u2019s a strong sense that this is my moment to make a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cI know in elected office, it\u2019s not up to me, it\u2019s up to voters. I know I have a finite time \u2014 the length of a term is all you\u2019ve been given to make an impact.\u201d\n\nHochul insists her next career move is the only part of her life that isn\u2019t scheduled.\n\n\u201cI've never looked at the next run,\u201d she said. \u201cWherever I'm at, that's my world and that's that's my existence. After 14 years on the [Hamburg] town board, I could have died having only been a town board member and thought that I really made a difference.\u201d\n\nHochul said she\u2019s tasked with creating political pressure during her travels for political maneuvers like the state\u2019s minimum wage hike and \u201cred-flag\u201d legislation that would prevent individuals showing signs they are a threat to themselves or others from possessing guns.\n\nHochul, in many ways, projects qualities that may not be Cuomo's strengths.\n\nHer public interactions are warm and gaffe-free, where Cuomo\u2019s off-script moments have more than once resulted in cringey \u2014 and occasionally viral \u2014 missteps. On a train ride to the state fair in late summer, Hochul spent much of the time roaming the aisles, striking up conversations about horse-riding, deep-fried cookie dough and Onondaga County. Cuomo sat in the back of the train with a group of agency leaders.\n\nHochul\u2019s a western New York native whose parents once lived in a trailer and who got her start as a student activist at Syracuse University. Cuomo\u2019s a Queens boy who came of age in politics as one of his father's trusted advisers.\n\nWhile Cuomo has occasionally stumbled while commenting on women\u2019s issues, Hochul can rattle off times she\u2019s been underestimated, disrespected or forced to juggle twice the responsibilities of her male counterparts. She told a group of women business owners of a time she burned her hand trying to steam a wrinkled dress in her hotel room at midnight and ran through the halls looking for ice. Her audience laughed in appreciation. She\u2019s adopted a hashtag on Twitter \u2014 #HowSheDoesIt \u2014 that documents how she stays sane. (It\u2019s protein bars and daily exercise, she says.)\n\nThose on the receiving end of her projects know her as the face of the administration\u2019s efforts, if nothing but for the number of times she\u2019s visited. The combination of her varied leadership roles and her background suggests she \u201cunderstands the plight of the middle class,\u201d said Erie County Democratic Committee Chairman Jeremy Zellner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a better advocate for western New York than the lieutenant governor,\u201d Zellner said. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly one of the hardest working people in government right now.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also familiar with rural Republican voters in ways many New York Democrats are not, and her record reflects that balancing act. While serving as Erie County clerk a decade ago, she vowed to have undocumented immigrants arrested if they applied for a driver\u2019s license in the offices she controlled. She has since changed positions, she has said.\n\nWhile those votes could come back to bite her should she seek another office, they also could be a boon in a political environment some say will require more moderate Democrats to pull Trump voters across the aisle.\n\n\u201cHe [Cuomo] picked the right person from a geographic perspective, a political perspective and a personal perspective,\u201d Bellafiore said. \u201cHe was the son of a restless lieutenant governor and he spent the rest of the time seeing what a pain in the neck a restless lieutenant governor can be.\u201c\n\nThe governor earlier this month said Hochul \u201ccould do anything,\u201d though he is \u201cselfish\u201d and wants her to stay with the administration.\n\n\u201cI think she could win any seat,\u201d Cuomo said when WAMC\u2019s Alan Chartock floated her name as a Democratic contender to succeed former U.S. Rep. Chris Collins. \u201cShe's just a great politician and official, you know, she's a rare combination.\u201d\n\nHochul briefly held the western New York House seat from which Collins resigned several weeks ago. In fact, she lost her reelection bid to Collins in 2012 after winning a special election in 2011. Would she return to Washington? She said she didn't see that scenario. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be lieutenant governor either,\" she added.\n\nIf Hochul does have higher political aspirations, she should be careful about being too obvious, according to Duffy.\n\nDuffy said he never saw the job as a political stepping stone and said he felt he built stronger relationships because his peers in state politics weren\u2019t eyeing him as a future opponent.\n\n\u201cThose who are out there in other positions, if they see her as a rival, may not be as pleasant or supportive in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the time being anyway, that has not been a problem.\n\n\u201cShe is in an outstanding position, if something opens up,\u201d said SKDKnickerbocker's Morgan Hook. \u201cShe\u2019s an ambassador for the administration, yes, but she\u2019s also an ambassador for herself.\"\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this report misstated Jeremy Zellner's title.
