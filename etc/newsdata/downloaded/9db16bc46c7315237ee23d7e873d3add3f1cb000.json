The real difficulty is in determining how the markets are likely to move in the future - something one can only take a guess on.\n\nBeta essentially tells you how much a stock has moved in relation to the Index for a defined time period. Beta patterns during the past five years only re-affirm the belief in some conventional wisdom -- tech stocks are riskier than the overall market and that FMCG stocks are defensive in nature.\n\nIn the empirical studies conducted it has been seen that Low Beta stocks generally performs better than Index and the index itself performs better than high beta stocks.\n\nReturns in long Term - Low Beta Stock > Index > High Beta Stocks\n\nPerformance Chart\n\nLow beta stocks have more stable returns and have generated good wealth for investors in long term time horizons. In such volatile markets which is swing is in either direction, sticking with low beta stocks is our advice as they provide stable returns in upside and in case of downside they have shown limited dent on investors portfolio.\n\nStocks Comparison\n\nWe have compared the performance of Yes Bank (NS: ) a high beta stock with Marico (NS: ) a low beta stock. We have also seen a good dividend history from low beta stocks.\n\nBeta values of stocks can change with surprising speed, making investing based on the beta can be difficult. But it is a useful way to manage your portfolio based on risk appetite.\n\nThe best alternative is to adopt a strategy based on your risk-taking ability and stick to it. So, if your risk-taking ability is high, you could go in for a portfolio that is more sensitive than the market. Otherwise, settle for a less sensitive one.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Yash Shah covering: Nifty 50, Marico Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd.
