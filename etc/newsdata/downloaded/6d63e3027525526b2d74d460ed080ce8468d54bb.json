He was reelected in 2019 and has since continued to insist that Boko Haram has been defeated despite the continuing prevalence of jihadist attacks. Buhari\u2019s military leaders contend that those currently committing acts of terror are not Boko Haram members, but members of the Islamic State \u2013 somehow different despite the fact that Boko Haram pledged allegiance to Islamic State \u201ccaliph\u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2015.\n\n\u201cIn the past four years, the majority of Nigerians have committed to change for the better,\u201d Buhari said on Tuesday, applauding the country for re-electing him. \u201cIndeed, this administration was re-elected by Nigerians on a mandate to deliver positive and enduring change \u2013 through maintaining our national security; restoring sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development; and fighting corruption against all internal and external threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I stated four years ago, \u2018Change does not just happen. We must change our lawless habits, our attitude to public office and public trust,\u201d he noted. \u201cSimply put, to bring about change, we must change ourselves by being law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nBuhari vowed to commit to \u201ca culture of Good Governance,\u201d and claimed his administration had done all it could to fight corruption in its ranks \u201cby investigating and prosecuting those accused of embezzlement and the misuse of public resources.\u201d He warned that the \u201cblight of corruption is fighting back,\u201d and he needed every Nigerian citizen to fight back by notifying police of any inappropriate activity.\n\nBuhari also urged Nigerians to temper their criticism of the government, implying that political dissent could lead to violence.\n\n\u201cI reiterate my call for all to exercise restraint, tolerance and mutual respect in airing their grievances and frustrations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst the ongoing national discourse on various political and religious issues is healthy and welcome, we must not forget the lessons of our past \u2013 lessons that are most relevant on a day such as this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe path of hatred and distrust only leads to hostility and destruction. I believe that the vast majority of Nigerians would rather tread the path of peace and prosperity, as we continue to uphold and cherish our unity,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nOn Boko Haram, Buhari took a moment to thank \u201cour gallant men and women in arms\u201d and allies that have offered military aid. He did not reiterate his claim that Boko Haram no longer exists, which his spokesman Garba Shehu most recently made in August.\n\n\u201cThe position of the Nigerian government is that the Boko Haram terrorism has been degraded and defeated. The real Boko Haram we know is defeated,\u201d Shehu said then. \u201cWhat we have now is a mixture of remnants of the Boko Haram, fugitive criminals\u2026[and jihadis in Northern Africa\u2019s Maghreb reigon] together with West African terrorists bonding together.\u201d\n\nNigerian Army Chief of Staff Tukur Buratai has similarly claimed that Boko Haram attacks do not represent Boko Haram, but rather a wing of the Islamic State founded by Boko Haram terrorists. This more recent argument is more nuanced than the 2015 claim by Buhari on the BBC that Nigeria had \u201cwon the war\u201d against the group.\n\nBoko Haram once again burned down Chibok village \u2013 home to the nearly 300 girls abducted in 2014 \u2013 in September.\n\nBuhari rounded out his speech with promises to invest in education, healthcare, and children\u2019s programs, noting that Nigeria has one of the world\u2019s highest birth rates.\n\nThe opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) did not heed Buhari\u2019s call to temper its criticism of his government. The speech, the party said in a statement, proved that Buhari is \u201cin no position to deliver a credible, acceptable and satisfactory independence address.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe party regretted that President Buhari had no forceful reassurances on the challenge of escalated insecurity under his watch,\u201d the PDP asserted. \u201cHe had no clear-cut and operable blueprint to revamp our economy, which his administration wrecked in a period of four years, resulting in so much hardship and despondency that Nigerians now resort to suicide and slavery abroad as options.\u201d\n\nThe United States issued a statement supporting Buhari and all Nigerians on their independence day Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Nigeria are working together to advance our shared goals of strengthening governance, countering corruption, enhancing trade and investment, furthering development, increasing food security, and improving public health,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we remain steadfast partners seeking to stop violent insurgencies and restore safe, secure livelihoods for those affected by the scourge of Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa. As Africa\u2019s most populous nation, Nigeria is a leader in the region, on the continent, and in the world.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari used his Independence Day address to call on Nigerians to again abandon their \"lawless habits.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1172842562-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
