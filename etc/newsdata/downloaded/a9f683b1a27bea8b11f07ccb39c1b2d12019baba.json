They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.\"\n\nWilson added that among traders, \"There seems to be increasing optimism that a narrow deal involving some tariff relief, currency 'pact' and China buying more US agricultural products, can be done.\"\n\n\"By lowering expectations and the scope of any agreement ahead of the talks, the Chinese have apparently presented a framework by which a limited, skinny deal can be brokered,\" he said.\n\nThe pound also reaffirmed its gains made on Thursday evening after on the news that Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, and Irish leader Leo Varadkar said that there was a \"pathway\" to a deal after private meetings. It moved 0.8% higher against the dollar on Friday morning.\n\nHere's a look at stocks around the world at 10 am in London (5 am EST):", "description": "Oil prices are surging after an Iranian oil tanker was hit by a suspected missile off the coast of Saudi Arabia.\u00a0\u00a0 Brent Crude Oil and West Texa...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5da04204cc4a0a6d3b040fa3-2400/2019-10-10t121947z1lynxmpef9915irtroptp4usa-stocks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
