No reason is given in his statement for why he asked to be let out of his contract but it\u2019s plain as day.\n\nHow sudden is this? So sudden that \u2026 today was his last day. The news broke during his final telecast. He\u2019d been at Fox since the network began in 1996.\n\nThe important question now: Where can I pre-order the Shep tell-all?\n\nShep Smith is leaving Fox News. A rather surprising decision given what he was being paid (a lot) and the freedom Fox News gave him. pic.twitter.com/3rdhdkkXVz \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 11, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s his final sign-off:\n\nFull video: Shepard Smith's final sign off from Fox News pic.twitter.com/5fgyM81Gbj \u2014 Jon Passantino (@passantino) October 11, 2019\n\nHow long can Chris Wallace hang on?\n\nYou all know the long-term background here. Shep is a man of the left and the most outspoken member of Fox\u2019s news division, which grumbled in print repeatedly (and usually anonymously) during the Trump era that the State TV propagandizing on Trump\u2019s behalf by the opinion division was making them look like a joke. Still, Fox execs seemed comfortable with that balance: Shep, Wallace, and Bret Baier gave the network the right to claim that its coverage of daily news was \u201cfair and balanced.\u201d Meanwhile, Hannity, Tucker, and Ingraham brought in the big ratings and big money with the nightly \u201cDemocratic villain du jour\u201d programming. Even Shep\u2019s news-hour editorializing against Trump kinda sorta worked for Fox. Anytime someone complained that the network was in the tank for the president, there was an easy reply. What about Shep?\n\nEveryone was happy, or happy enough. Fox management, Shep, the primetime crew, all doing their own thing and making bank. But there was one very important person who wasn\u2019t so happy.\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s antipathy bothered Shep. If anything, he likely treated it like a badge of honor. He was, however, clearly annoyed a few weeks ago when one of the president\u2019s cronies, Joe diGenova, was allowed in primetime to denigrate a guest on Shep\u2019s own show, Andrew Napolitano, as a \u201cfool\u201d for thinking Trump may have committed a crime in his phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president. I wrote about that more than once that week. Shep complained about it on the air, then Tucker Carlson invited diGenova back and scoffed at Shep for being more partisan than Tucker himself is. What followed, according to Vanity Fair, may have been the final straw:\n\nSeeking to quell the internecine strife before it carried into a third day, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace communicated to Smith this morning to stop attacking Carlson, a person briefed on the conversation said. \u201cThey said if he does it again, he\u2019s off the air,\u201d the source said. (Fox News spokesperson Irena Briganti denied that management had any direct conversation with Smith).\n\nNote the unusual qualifier in Fox\u2019s denial to VF: There was no \u201cdirect\u201d conversation with Shep about the matter. Anyway, if the Vanity Fair report is true, Smith might have figured that the rules of the game at Fox had changed. With the election approaching, he was no longer quite as free to do his own thing; he and his guests were now being mocked by the primetime hosts for their disloyalty to the king and, allegedly, Shep would no longer be permitted to defend himself. If Fox management is enabling a total Trumpist takeover of the network as the 2020 campaign heats up then Smith might as well cut the cord now.\n\nHow much of a secret was his departure? Here\u2019s how Cavuto took the baton after Shep\u2019s on-air farewell:\n\nNeil Cavuto and John Roberts clearly blind-sided by Shep Smith departure pic.twitter.com/36ijhC8th6 \u2014 Nicole Lafond (@Nicole_Lafond) October 11, 2019\n\nIf you\u2019re expecting to see Shep turn up on CNN or MSNBC next week, think again. Not the part about him working for one of those networks; that\u2019s definitely going to happen. It just won\u2019t be next week.\n\nShep has agreed to a non-compete, which means he's not joining CNN/MSNBC anytime soon: \"Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News. After requesting that I stay, they obliged. Under our agreement, I won't be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near feature\u2026\" \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) October 11, 2019\n\nHe\u2019ll need the time off to work on that tell-all anyway. I assume there\u2019s a non-disparagement clause in his contract too which will prevent him from going the Carl Cameron route with Fox, but who knows? Imagine tuning into Rachel Maddow\u2019s show next week and there he is, ready to make the case at length that Fox primetime is gross.\n\nMeanwhile, people are noting on social media that the Times reported yesterday that Bill Barr paid a visit to Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch on Wednesday of this week to discuss matters as yet unknown. I\u2019m not so much of a Never Trumper that I believe the Attorney General of the United States was tasked with personally warning Fox\u2019s head honcho that the programming had better take a rosier view of the president or else the DOJ might take an interest in his company. But I\u2019ve spent enough time at the Trump circus these past two and a half years to make me more curious about what was said at that meeting after Smith\u2019s departure than I was before.\n\nThere\u2019s no word yet on who\u2019ll replace him as the 3 p.m. anchor. The way Fox is going, I assume it\u2019ll be Trump\u2019s hand with a pair of eyes drawn on it like Senor Wences and \u201cJohnny\u201d with the president providing the audio out of frame. Exit question: \u201cCNN Primetime News featuring Shepard Smith and Megyn Kelly.\u201d Coming next year, maybe?\n\nUpdate: Predictable. No one at Fox News has \u201cbad ratings\u201d and Trump knows it better than most.", "description": "Endgame.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ss.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
