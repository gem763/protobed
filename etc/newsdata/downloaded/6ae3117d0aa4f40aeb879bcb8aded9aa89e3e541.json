The current number of arrests is more than 1,300\n\nWashout: Numbers of demonstrators was down from last week as rain swept into the capital this morning\n\nThey have borrowed the Bruce Lee phrase 'Be Water', which was used by the Hong Kong protesters, to describe constantly changing targets to out-fox police.\n\nThis morning, dozens of activists are sitting or standing in the road as City workers leave Bank tube station.\n\nIn some surrounding streets traffic has been brought to a standstill, with 20 double-decker buses queuing down Lombard Street and King William Street were rendered stationary by the climate change protesters at Bank station.\n\nThe driver of the bus at the front of the queue said he had been stuck there for two hours - since 7am - and protesters showed no signs of moving.\n\nProtesters, sheltering under umbrellas, are holding aloft flags bearing the Extinction Rebellion logo, while drummers play.\n\nActivists have covered themselves in a large green tarpaulin to protect against the rain.\n\nMany are holding banners and placards bearing messages targeting financial institutions, such as 'divest from climate change' and 'invest in soil not oil'.\n\nDave Evans, 32, an IT consultant from London, said he had taken two weeks unpaid leave to join the Extinction Rebellion protests. He said the finance sector needed to 'stop funding the climate crisis'.\n\nDrain: Unhelpful protesters need up to eight officers each to arrest them, meaning forces in other parts of London struggle\n\nWet: Some of the group crowded beneath a tarpaulin while others clutched umbrellas as they try to keep the movement going\n\nDead weight: A protester refuses to assist police, meaning it takes four officers to take him away to the police van\n\nThe Met Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said last week that the protests were stretching London's police resources and hitting victims of real crime elsewhere in the capital.\n\nHe said on Friday: 'Their behaviour still continues. They've deliberately set out to seek and cause chaos, they're performing activity that makes it dangerous and slow for us to clear them.\n\n'And whilst we're not anti-protest, we are against them repeatedly breaking the law and causing this really significant disruption and as the Commissioner said this morning, this isn't a game for Londoners.\n\n'We have other things that we should be doing across London. We've had to take officers from those local communities and stop doing anything that's is not critical or urgent towards business and that's just not right.'\n\nIt comes as Scotland Yard's top officer warned that the Met had been 'stretched' by the Extinction Rebellion protests, impeding its ability to respond to other crimes.\n\nDame Cressida said she hoped the protesters would choose to either 'protest lawfully' at Trafalgar Square or 'go home'.", "description": "Protesters have blocked a junction outside the Bank of England as they use Hong-Kong-inspired moving protests to cause maximum disruption.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19681518-0-image-a-19_1571040227175.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
