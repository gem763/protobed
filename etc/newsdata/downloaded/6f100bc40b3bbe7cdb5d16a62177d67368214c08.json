The oldest son escaped to find help at a bar.", "language": "en", "text": "He had not been outside in nine years, he told Westerbeek.\n\nThe 25-year-old man was in desperate need of help, he said. He had managed to sneak out of the small, secret room where he and his adult siblings had been kept all that time, living in isolation in a farmhouse just outside Ruinerwold that appeared almost abandoned. He said he had never been to school and hadn\u2019t been to the barber in nearly a decade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe said he was the oldest and wanted to end the way they were living,\u201d Westerbeek said, according to the BBC.\n\nOn Tuesday, the man\u2019s plea for help was answered by police.\n\nThe family was rescued from the farmhouse this week after a tip from a \u201cyoung man\u201d who was \u201cworried about the living conditions of his family\u201d led authorities to search the property, police in the Netherlands province of Drenthe said in a statement. Upon arriving, police found a father and his six children living in the small, enclosed space, the statement said. A 58-year-old man described in Dutch media as a \u201chandyman\u201d was arrested on the property for refusing to cooperate with police, who said they do not know the man\u2019s relationship to the family at this time. The children told investigators they were all adults, which police said will \u201cof course be further investigated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCiting unnamed sources, RTV Drenthe reported they had been living under the impression that they were the only people left in the world. They were waiting for \u201cthe end of time,\u201d the news outlet reported.\n\nOfficials did not confirm reports regarding the family\u2019s beliefs, saying the case was still under investigation.\n\n\u201cOur primary concern is for the family members,\u201d a police spokeswoman told the Guardian. \u201cWhat exactly happened in the farmhouse is still very unclear. We are exploring all possible scenarios.\u201d\n\nFrom a distance, the farmhouse yard looked unkempt, peppered with sheds and untrimmed shrubs, neighbors who lived down the road told local media. The home is a few dozen meters off the main road, accessible only by crossing a bridge over a small stream, then driving up a dirt road until reaching a gate. Sometimes the neighbors saw a dog, a goat and geese outside \u2014 but never children.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe local postal worker said he never once delivered a letter to the home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually pretty strange, now I come to think about it,\u201d he told the Dutch news outlet Algemeen Dagblad, according to the BBC.\n\nInside, the family was self-sufficient, subsisting on the vegetables from the garden and a goat, and possibly with help from the 58-year-old tenant, Dutch media reported.\n\nHe was the only one neighbors ever saw outside, coming and going in a blue Volvo, not talking to anyone.\n\n\u201cWe always thought that one man was living in the house who was renovating the place,\u201d one neighbor told the Guardian. \u201cWe had no idea.\u201d\n\nSome local carpenters knew the 58-year-old man as a gifted furniture maker and woodworker who kept his personal life to himself, the newspaper Dagblad van het Noorden reported. But his reclusive nature led some neighbors to grow suspicious of what might be going on behind the gate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo one ever came to his yard. We thought: It must have something to do with hemp cultivation or something,\u201d a neighbor who said she met the man only once told Dagblad van het Noorden. \u201cBut this? We never suspected this.\u201d\n\nWhen police arrived this week to investigate, they found a secret area that had \u201ca number of rooms with makeshift furnishings where a family was living an isolated existence,\u201d the local mayor, Roger de Groot, said during a news conference, the Guardian reported.\n\nNone of the family members were registered with the local government, police said, meaning there was no way to know they existed. The owner of the farmhouse, a prominent local figure, said she was \u201cspeechless,\u201d believing she had been renting the home to a single 58-year-old man for years and having \u201cno idea\u201d other people were inside, Algemeen Dagblad reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Drenthe police said in a statement that the family had been taken to a doctor and is now being cared for. A \u201clarge scale\u201d investigation is ongoing, and authorities are working with prosecutors to consider whether criminal charges will be brought in the case.\n\nDe Groot said authorities believe that the children\u2019s mother died years ago, but that there were too many questions remaining regarding how the family ended up living this way over the past nine years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d de Groot said.\n\nAD", "description": "He told the bar owner he had not been outside in nine years, and needed help rescuing his siblings.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4MHFiRD2Nv4W1VONIclWssPKukg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X44E7TMS45DWHL3OKRVAKQLR5Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
