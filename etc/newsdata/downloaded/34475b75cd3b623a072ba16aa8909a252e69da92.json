She keep just saying no.\n\n\"I could have argued until I was blue in the face but I left. It was humiliating.\"\n\nAbbey has been campaigning against disability discrimination online for years but admits she would never expect to see it in her hometown.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nNow, after being reportedly shunned twice, she is speaking out to give others the strength to stand up for themselves.\n\nAbbey said: \"I have a congenital condition from birth which means I'm in a wheelchair. It affects my wrists more than anything, but I can manipulate my fingers.\n\n\"I had no issues getting into the shop or going up to the desk. There was no problems with access and I had my carer with me anyway.\n\n\"Being body positive is a big part of my identity. A lot of people would stop going out for this kind of thing.\n\n\"I've had no response from them. It's so wrong.\"\n\nOn the nail salon's Facebook page, a post read: \"Dear customers, you may have read on social media, about a customer who has made a complaint, stating discrimination under the Equality and Disability Act, which she posted on Facebook.\n\n\"We did not at no point refused to do your nails due to 'your twisted hand' (as you stated).\n\n\"We advised you that to do your nail due to the fact that we would not be able to position yourself safely, without causing you great discomfort to perform the service with the position of your hand.\n\n\"This would have made it very unsafe for you.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"We pride ourselves on our health and safety of all our customers and staff, and on this occasion this was the priority, for both you and staff to not be positioned in a way to cause injury and discomfort while performing and receiving a nail treatment.\n\n\"As this matter has now been raised in negative direction, we have no alternative but to seek advise from our legal representative to protect our business image.\n\n\"We will not post any further comments in relation to this matter after this post.\n\n\"Thank you for your understanding.\"\n\nThe manager of Nail Studio added: \"This is the first time Abbey come to our salon, not the second time like she said.\"", "description": "Abbey Phipps, who has a congenital condition, says the salon in March, Cambridgeshire, refused to paint her nails", "authors": ["Sophie Norris", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578667.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
