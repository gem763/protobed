Yeung said he had simply relayed what television media had reported on the shooting of a student.\n\nReporter slams police brutality after journalists injured while covering protests\n\nPolice raised concerns in a letter dated October 9 about posts published the previous month, including one alleging officers harassed a female protester during a car search in Tung Chung.\n\nAnother accused police of \u201ckilling Hong Kong people\u201d in a campaign urging internet users to file complaints with the White House about what they called \u201cpolice brutality\u201d.\n\nThe force also highlighted a post tagged \u201clive shot fired to kill citizen\u201d, claiming the author of the message had sought to \u201cmake up facts\u201d and distort the aim of the police operation.\n\nMany people disagree with the way riot police have handled the protests.

And I am not going to remove the post,\u201d Yeung said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHong Kong people do not need police to teach us what we should read on social media.\u201d\n\nHenry Chan Wan-hoi, a critic of the Hong Kong government who is described as an online influencer, said the force\u2019s reaction amounted to interference with basic freedoms.\n\nIn a post on Tuesday, Chan wrote: \u201cIt is an open challenge to press and speech freedoms.\u201d", "description": "The action has lead to accusations of interfering with Hongkongers' right to free speech, though the social media giant refused to remove the posts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/23ae8b30-fa55-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15imagehires145110.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
