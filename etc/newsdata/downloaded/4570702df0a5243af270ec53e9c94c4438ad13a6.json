Details from the briefing for family members were shared with CNN by Anton Sahadi, a spokesperson for the relatives.\n\nThe report summary said that faulty \"assumptions\" were made during the design and certification of the 737 Max about how pilots would respond to malfunctions by the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), according to the presentation seen by CNN.\n\nMCAS lowers the nose of the plane when it receives information that the aircraft is flying too slowly or steeply, and at risk of stalling. The system was vulnerable because it relied on a single angle of attack (AOA) sensor, investigators said.\n\nThe AOA sensor on the doomed Lion Air plane had been miscalibrated during a repair, according to investigators. But the airline's maintenance crews and pilots couldn't identify the problem because one of the aircraft's safety features \u2014 the AOA Disagree alert \u2014 was not \"correctly enabled during Boeing 737-8 (Max) development,\" they said.\n\nRead More", "description": "Indonesian investigators shared a final report into the deadly Lion Air crash involving a Boeing 737 Max plane with families of the victims on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Sherisse Pham", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191023034036-lion-air-crash-181029-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
