I don\u2019t know why [the headteacher] hasn\u2019t said anything to me in person.\u2019\n\nStacy said she would not have been so upset if she had known her son was offered the hot meal first.\n\nAt the time, she pulled Jayden out of school over the issue but sent him back the next day after being threatened with a fine for unauthorised absence.\n\nShe then spoke to the headteacher on the phone once Jayden had gone back to ask for assurances for the future.\n\nBut in the letter, which Stacy has given to the press, the headteacher accuses the mother of only speaking to her on the phone to get \u2018enough information\u2019 to sell her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe head wrote: \u2018I went out of my way on Friday, during our telephone conversation, so that we could move forward and put the incident behind us, to ensure the best for Jayden.\n\n\u2018It has now become apparent that the sole purpose of the conversation was so that you could gain enough information for a follow up newspaper report once again completely based on untruths and misquotes.\u2019\n\nThe school said it hoped Stacy adheres to its values of respect, responsibility, kindness, honesty and friendship in the future (Picture: MEN)\n\nStacy, who is also mum to Alisha, seven, and Cole, five, said she \u2018does not know what to do now\u2019.\n\nThe letter said her actions caused \u2018a great deal of stress and upset\u2019 to all staff at the school.\n\nShe has been warned she will be banned from the school site if she is \u2018rude\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 again.\n\nIn a statement, the school said: \u2018Thanet school promotes five key values of respect, responsibility, kindness, honesty and friendship.\n\n\u2018I have written to Miss Jarvis to request she adheres to these values.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
