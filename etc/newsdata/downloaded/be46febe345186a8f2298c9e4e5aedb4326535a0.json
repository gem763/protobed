And his avowed desire to force a unity coalition including both their parties made it likely that, if the projections held, Mr. Gantz would be given the first chance of forming a government.\n\nThe murky outcome itself was a humiliating blow to Mr. Netanyahu, 69, the nation\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, who forced the do-over election when he failed to assemble a coalition in May, rather than let Mr. Gantz have a try. For the second time in a row, his onetime deputy, Avigdor Liberman, denied Mr. Netanyahu a majority, this time urging the formation of a unity government.\n\n\u201cAccording to the current results, Netanyahu did not complete his mission,\u201d Mr. Gantz told a crowd of cheering supporters in Tel Aviv early Wednesday. \u201cWe did.\u201d", "description": "Exit polls pointed to serious obstacles for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose main rival Benny Gantz\u2019s party seemed to have come out ahead.", "authors": ["David M.
