One study of rhesus macaques showed that mothers attended to their crying infants faster when there were unrelated monkeys around; the researchers surmised that the rhesus mothers were concerned that their babies\u2019 cries, which are \u201chigh-pitched, grating and nasty to listen to,\u201d per the BBC, might provoke the other monkeys. As Dr. Sokol-Chang put it, even monkey parents think, \u201cdon\u2019t embarrass me in front of my friends.\u201d\n\nSo how do you get your whiny kid to cut it out already?\n\nIgnore the behavior. Dr. Dunya Poltorak, a pediatric medical psychologist in private practice in Birmingham, Mich., said the first thing to know is that disciplining children for whining can backfire. \u201cScolding or disciplining can inadvertently reinforce the behavior. They\u2019re looking for a response; when they don\u2019t get a positive response, they\u2019ll go for the negative one,\u201d Dr. Poltorak said. Children look to you to model behavior, so if you\u2019re yelling, \u201cI can\u2019t stand it when you do that, you drive me crazy!\u201d you\u2019re basically teaching them to give that right back to you.\n\nDr. Poltorak recommended finding a calm moment and sitting down with your child, saying something like: \u201cI love listening to you and I love helping you. Let\u2019s practice using our nicest words to ask for help, because if you whine or cry or scream, I won\u2019t be able to help you.\u201d Then you need to follow through and ignore your kid when she asks for something in a whiny voice. Children\u2019s whiny behavior may escalate when you begin ignoring it, Dr. Poltorak cautioned, so be prepared to stay the course; in time, they\u2019ll realize whining doesn\u2019t get them the attention they desire. When your child asks for things nicely, make sure to reinforce that good behavior with praise, Dr. Poltorak said.\n\nCatch the whine before it starts. Another tactic, which Dr. Sokol-Chang recommended, is to try to observe your child\u2019s particular behavioral signs that tend to lead up to a whine, so that you can give her positive attention before it even starts. But this isn\u2019t always possible, especially if your child starts whining every time you attempt to have a conversation with another adult.", "description": "And how to stop them from driving you bonkers.", "authors": ["Jessica Grose"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/multimedia/parenting-whining/parenting-whining-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
