The Washington Post reported on Monday that NOAA\u2019s chief scientist, Craig McLean, in an email to employees the night before, said that not only was NOAA\u2019s Sept. 6 statement incorrect but that its political nature probably broke rules on science integrity.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political,\u201d he said in the email, adding that the statement from NOAA \u201ccompromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.\u201d\n\nTherefore, he continued, \u201cI am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity. I have a responsibility to pursue these truths. I will.\u201d\n\nJane Lubchenco, a NOAA head under President Barack Obama, also ripped the agency she used to lead, calling the statement last week an \u201cappalling political manipulation\u201d of National Weather Service data and praising McLean for his action.\n\n\u201cNo more political interference with public safety!\u201d she wrote in a tweet.\n\nThe American Meteorological Society also defended the Birmingham workers, saying in a statement that the group \u201cconsistently put the safety of the American public first and foremost.\u201d", "description": "It may be the first time the rank and file pushed back so publicly.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Kmz5VozaNGTCjDVH_GTmoQ--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/cdc7a9727ab202b788834d4efd1b1ff8", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
