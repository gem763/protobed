It\u2019s the Beacon 2.0.\n\nThe digital display is meant to sit on the car\u2019s dashboard, and will glow a specific color that riders chose in the app to help them find the right car in crowded situations. The Beacon\u2019s digital display also reminds riders to wear their seat belt, close car doors gently, and exit curbside. The original Beacon first rolled out in 2016.\n\nHere\u2019s how Uber describes it:\n\nIt\u2019s a hardware device that lets you find your rider easier, through satellite and sensor technologies, and also through colors that sync with the rider\u2019s app. In addition, Beacon features a screen that communicates with your rider and reminds them to wear their seat belt and exit curbside. The device pairs with your phone through Bluetooth and is designed to be installed on your car dashboard.\n\nThe device has a magnetic base that allows it to attach to the dash, and it connects to a car\u2019s power outlet via a USB cable. The device can connect to a driver\u2019s phone via Bluetooth, and will collect some data, such as GNSS, IMU, and barometer data to \u201cimprove driver and rider experiences, especially better accuracy of pickup and dropoff locations,\u201d the company says.\n\nBeacon will collect some data from drivers, such as GNSS, IMU, and barometer data to \u201cimprove driver and rider experiences\u201d\n\nSelect Uber drivers will begin to receive the new Beacon starting in early November, according to Uber\u2019s website. The device will be sent to drivers who are rated Platinum and Diamond in Uber Pro, the company\u2019s driver rewards program. Only drivers who operate in Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, and Washington, DC are eligible, but Uber plans to make the Beacon available in more cities soon.\n\n\u201cBuilding on the original generation of Beacon hardware, we\u2019re excited to introduce this updated version to a handful of the communities we serve,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for more ways to add convenience to the Uber experience.\u201d\n\nThe original Beacon was an offshoot of Spot, a product pilot launched by Uber in Seattle in 2015. Spot was a long, thin LED light to attach to the inside of their windshields, which riders could control to better identify their drivers. Uber found that Spot reduced the need for riders and drivers to contact one another and lowered cancellation rates in tricky pickup locations.\n\nAlso, the first Beacon was in clear need of an update, given it was designed to look like Uber\u2019s old \u201cbit\u201d logo that was dropped in late 2018. Now it more closely resembles the Amp devices used by Lyft drivers, with its dual-sided digital display.\n\nUber has been tweaking its main product, its app, in recent months in an effort to improve the seamlessness of pickups and drop-offs. The company recently introduced a unique, four-digit PIN verification system aimed at making sure riders don\u2019t get into the wrong vehicle. If you opt in, you\u2019ll need to say the PIN out loud to your driver before he or she can start the ride.\n\nUber is also developing a new technology that uses ultrasound waves to automatically verify you\u2019re in the right car, no PIN needed. The rider\u2019s phone will send this ultrasonic signal to the driver\u2019s phone to automatically verify the unique PIN. The company has said that technology should be ready to roll before the end of 2019.", "description": "Uber is introducing an updated version of its colorful Beacon gadget, according to a filing with the Federal Communications Commission.
