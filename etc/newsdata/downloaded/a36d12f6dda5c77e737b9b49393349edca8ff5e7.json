This week's highlights include the Sacha Baron Cohen vehicle The Spy, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: The Animated Series, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Hip-Hop Evolution Season 3 and the superhero flick Aquaman.\n\nRead on for everything coming to the service for the week of September 1 to September 8.\n\nNetflix isn't releasing any Original movies this week. However, it is adding a stack of third-party offerings including Hotel Transylvania 2, Olympus Has Fallen and the aforementioned Aquaman.\n\nThere are also six new series to sink your teeth into. The highlight is probably The Spy based on the life of Israel's top Mossad spy Eli Cohen. (In an interesting bit of stunt casting, Cohen is portrayed by the actor/comedian Sacha Baron Cohen who is perhaps best known for Borat. But it's most assuredly not a comedy.) The second season of gritty teen thriller Elite also drops on Friday.\n\nEverything Coming To Stan, Netflix And Foxtel In September 2019 September's come around and along with the fresh spring weather, there's a new bundle of content to get through from Stan, Netflix and Foxtel.
