(Billie Weiss/Getty Images)\n\nLongtime umpire Joe West was behind the plate on Sunday night for the Philadelphia Phillies\u2019 5-2 win against the New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park, the final game of their three-game series.\n\nThings, however, got a bit awkward in the top of the eighth inning after outfielder Rajai Davis attempted to slide into home.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter second baseman Jeff McNeil hit a grounder to first base, Davis attempted to score and tried to slide around Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto. Davis, though, was too late and ended up sliding wide right.\n\nAfter Realmuto made the tag, Davis\u2019 momentum ended up carrying him right into West\u2019s legs \u2014 which knocked the 66-year-old over.\n\nand in a moment of perfect symbiosis: Rajai Davis's face inflicts the perfect insult-to-Joe-West's-injury pic.twitter.com/RXrqYCTghb \u2014 Hannah Keyser (@HannahRKeyser) September 2, 2019\n\nWest awkwardly landed right on top of Davis, and struggled to get back up to his feet \u2014 even after trying to use Davis\u2019 back to do so.\n\nEventually, Phillies pitcher Hector Neris had to help him back to his feet.\n\nThen, finally, West was able to officially make the call at the plate.\n\nRajai Davis getting called out here is a real insult-to-injury moment pic.twitter.com/YIMluCoMtb \u2014 Hannah Keyser (@HannahRKeyser) September 2, 2019\n\nThankfully, West wasn\u2019t hurt during the play.\n\nDavis\u2019 face during the whole thing, however, was priceless.\n\nNaturally, social media had jokes\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for fans to take to social media after the incident at home plate, either.\n\nStory continues\n\nLove that Joe West still had the wherewithal to still make the out call after all of this.
