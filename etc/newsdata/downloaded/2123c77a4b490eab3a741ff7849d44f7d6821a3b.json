Apple introduced its 2019 line of smartphones Tuesday, and pre-orders have now started.\n\nSadly, the latest lineup brings nothing new to the table. Like previous devices, the iPhone 11 features technology that has been available to Android users for some time.\n\nToday, I want to compare features of Android smartphones you can get today with those of Apple\u2019s latest flagship smartphone. You\u2019ll see that Android smartphones also are much cheaper than Apple\u2019s AAPL, -1.73%.\n\nThree types of iPhones\n\nNew iPhones come in three flavors: iPhone 11 (starting at $699), iPhone 11 Pro (starting at $999) and iPhone 11 Pro Max (starting at $1,099). They look much like older XS, XS Max and XR models \u2014 so much so that even the annoying notch that blocks part of the screen was cloned. (The notch houses a camera, speaker and Face ID technology.)\n\nOther brands have come up with solutions: The Samsung Galaxy S10 series ($749-$999) reduced the notch to a small cutout, and the OnePlus 7 Pro ($699-$749) has removed it altogether. The camera on that device is tucked inside the body of the smartphone, taking up no screen real estate. When you need to use it, it simply pops up. Nifty!\n\nBut what about the new triple 12-megapixel camera setup on the iPhone 11 Pro? Cameras seem like the biggest upgrade the iPhone has had in years. Here, too, Apple came late to the party. While great, they\u2019re by no means better than cameras on some of the already available Android models.\n\nAccording to Apple, the telephoto lens on the iPhone 11 Pro is capable of four times optical zoom. Nice, but Huawei P30 Pro ($746-$790) enables five times optical zoom on its telephoto lens, as well as 10 times of what\u2019s called hybrid zoom, which is software-augmented. (It looks great.) The P30 Pro also has a 32-megapixel selfie camera that captures more details than that of the 12-megapixel iPhone 11.\n\nThe iPhone takes great night shots, but if you want a phone with a superior nighttime mode, look no further than the Google Pixel 3 ($499-$699). Proprietary technology makes sure every night shot comes out with unmatched detail and color clarity. Also, watch out for Google\u2019s Pixel 4 launch, which is likely to take place in October.\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s charging speed (at 18 watts) is lower than the Samsung Galaxy S10\u2019s 20W, or optional 45W, charger. Samsung\u2019s flagship is also faster at wireless charging, providing 15W of power vs. Apple\u2019s 7.5W.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t get\n\nWhen buying an iPhone 11 series, you also get to enjoy the \u201camenities,\u201d such as:\n\n\u2022 No direct 3.5-millimeter connection for headphones. (You need to use that annoying dongle.)\n\n\u2022 No expansion slots. (The Samsung Galaxy S10 can be expanded to 512 gigabytes.)\n\n\u2022 60-hertz screens. (The OnePlus 7 Pro has a 90-Hz screen, and it\u2019s a trend other Android phones are likely to follow.)\n\n\u2022 No wireless reverse charging, so you can\u2019t top up your friend\u2019s phone as you can with the Huawei P30 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and some others.\n\n\u2022 Apple has cut prices for the cheapest phone in the lineup, but you are still paying a premium.\n\nLet\u2019s make one thing clear: The iPhone 11 series is not a bad smartphone lineup. Far from it. They are sleek and elegant phones, and their users will find them enjoyable. My bet is that the cheapest model, the iPhone 11, will sell like hotcakes.\n\nLack of innovation\n\nHowever, Apple is not what it used to be. If the company wants to reclaim the title of innovation leader that it once had, it needs to start noticing the competition, work on its feature set and lead, rather than follow. At this point, innovation for Apple means refining and iterating what real industry innovators \u2014 Android manufacturers \u2014 did years ago. Either do that or lower prices and find profits elsewhere (service subscriptions). And it seems Apple may be set on the latter.\n\nLynnette Luna, principal analyst at data and analytics company GlobalData, said in a release that \u201cthe question with this new range of iPhones is whether consumers will find enough value to upgrade to a new phone or wait until 2020 when Apple is expected to introduce 5G-enabled smartphones, which will be capable of transmitting faster data speeds. The primary selling point for the iPhone 11 line is better camera features.\u201d\n\nEven though Apple has cut prices, it\u2019s still not enough. You\u2019re simply not getting a cutting-edge device, and that is Apple\u2019s biggest flaw this year.\n\nJurica Dujmovic is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "You pay a premium price for a device that underperforms Android rivals, says Jurica Dujmovic.", "authors": ["Jurica Dujmovic"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ691_Apple_ZG_20190904142048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
