Traditional Christians", "language": "en", "text": "Here\u2019s a revealing anecdote, via the Daily Mail:\n\nThe one issue Hillary and Chelsea don\u2019t appear to agree on entirely is transgender self-identification. In an interview with The Sunday Times, journalist Decca Aitkenhead asked the Clintons if someone with a beard and a penis can ever be a woman, to which Chelsea replied emphatically, \u2018Yes.\u2019 However, as Aitkenhead describes it, Hillary looked \u2018uneasy\u2019, and blamed generational gaps for being less accepting. \u2018Errr. I\u2019m just learning about this,\u2019 Hillary responded. \u2018It\u2019s a very big generational discussion, because this is not something I grew up with or ever saw. It\u2019s going to take a lot more time and effort to understand what it means to be defining yourself differently.\u2019\n\nChelsea Clinton is 39 years old, and was raised in Washington and New York. She and her husband and children live in Manhattan. Plainly she has absorbed the lightning-fast cultural changes that have occurred in her lifetime. I would not be the least bit surprised if she affirmed Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s view that churches, religious schools, and charities that acted on their opposition to LGBT rights should lose tax-exempt status.\n\nUnfortunately for the Democratic Party, its presidential candidates have to run in the United States of America, not Manhattan.\n\nPete Buttigieg this morning said that Beto went too far. His comments are somewhat reassuring, though he began by saying that \u201canti-discrimination law should apply to all institutions.\u201d How does he reconcile that with the rest of his statement? And does he think that only explicitly religious institutions should receive a pass?\n\nIn the Democratic televised debate coming up on Tuesday, every one of the candidates should be forced to declare themselves, and to explain their decision, one way or the other. Writing in the Atlantic, law professor John Inazu said the Dems are going to regret what Beto said. Excerpt:\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments mark the first time a Democratic presidential candidate has overtly endorsed stripping the tax-exempt status of religious organizations who hold conservative views about marriage and sexuality. This feels very much like the candidate Obama\u2019s \u201ccling to guns and religion\u201d comment at a 2008 San Francisco fundraiser that became first an attack line used by Hillary Clinton and then a well-worn conservative talking point that the would-be president was aloof and out of touch with small-town America. But more troubling than the rhetoric is where it leads. And for that, let me offer three suggestions to people with skill sets I lack: one for pollsters, one for journalists, and one for policy analysts. First, pollsters should ask voters about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments and the issue of tax-exempt status, both now and in the exit polls for the 2020 presidential election. We can be certain this issue will be used in Republican political ads, especially in congressional districts that Obama won in 2012, but that Trump won in 2016. And I suspect this issue and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s framing of it will lead to increased turnout of evangelicals in states that matter to Democrats, such as Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment may quickly fall out of the national news cycle, but it won\u2019t be forgotten among churches, religious organizations, and religious voters. And if the Democrats lose in 2020, this issue and their handling of it will likely be a contributing factor. That will be true regardless of who the eventual Republican or Democratic candidates are. Second, journalists should ask O\u2019Rourke and every other Democratic candidate how this policy position would affect conservative black churches, mosques and other Islamic organizations, and orthodox Jewish communities, among others. It is difficult to understand how Democratic candidates can be \u201cfor\u201d these communities\u2014advocating tolerance along the way\u2014if they are actively lobbying to put them out of business. Third, policy analysts should assess the damage O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would cause to the charitable sector. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s stance\u2014if played out to its end\u2014would decimate the charitable sector. It is certainly the case that massive amounts of government funding flow through religious charitable organizations in the form of grants and tax exemptions. But anyone who thinks this is simply a pass-through that can be redirected to government providers or newly established charitable networks that better conform to Democratic orthodoxies is naive to the realities of the charitable sector.\n\nInazu goes on to point out that liberals \u2014 even really smart ones, like Harvard\u2019s Robert Putnam \u2014 often greatly underestimate the role churches and religious charities play in fighting poverty and doing disaster relief. I can well imagine that for liberals who don\u2019t know any church folks, \u201cconservative churches\u201d are nothing more than local version of Trump cheerleader Robert Jeffress\u2019s Baptodome in Dallas. (And for the record, Jeffress\u2019s church, whether or not you approve of its pastor\u2019s politics, does a lot of charitable work.)\n\nAnd by the way, guess how much Mr. and Mrs. Beto O\u2019Rourke donated to charity this year? A whopping $1,166, or about 0.3 percent of their income.\n\nMore:\n\nThe O\u2019Rourkes reported an adjusted gross income of $366,455 in 2017, the most recent year made available by the campaign, and gave only $1,166 to charity. The two years before, the couple gave even less: $857 in 2016 and $867 in 2015. Over the ten years of tax returns released by O\u2019Rourke, only one year showed giving that rose above $2,000. That was 2013 when the O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gave $12,900 to a variety of charities. With an adjusted gross income of $301,092 that year, the larger gift boosted the percentage donated to nearly 4.3% of their income. But none of the other years, going back to 2008, show charitable giving over 1% of their income.\n\nCNN reports that Americans on average give two percent of their annual income to charity. Most conservative religious believers I know tithe around ten percent to their church, or church-related charities. If the poor are depending on liberal Catholic Beto O\u2019Rourke for charitable contributions, they\u2019re going to go hungry.\n\nAnyway, Beto is not going to be president, but Elizabeth Warren might. I would like to reacquaint you with her contempt for religious conservatives. Nota bene: disagreement is not the same thing as contempt. One expects a liberal Democrat to oppose the views of a religious conservative on same-sex marriage. What this response demonstrated was mockery and spite:\n\nThat answer went viral. The media loved it too.\n\nBut ask yourself this. What if a religiously conservative GOP presidential candidate were asked this version of the question: \u201cSenator, I believe that marriage should be between two people who love each other, regardless of their sex. What is your response?\u201d And what if that religious conservative said, \u201cI\u2019m going to assume that the questioner is a woman, and I\u2019m going to say, \u2018You just haven\u2019t met the right man yet \u2014 if you can find one to look at you, bless your heart.'\u201d\n\nThat is the exact parallel to what Elizabeth Warren said, to the guffaws and applause of people in the room, and the cheers of many in the media. Had a Republican said such a thing, the pile-on and beatdown would have been endless, and that Republican would have deserved strong criticism. I don\u2019t at all agree with the pro-gay marriage position, but those Americans who do believe in it, both gay and straight, deserve respect from our leaders, not mockery.\n\nBut this is how the Senator from Massachusetts and former Harvard professor regards religious conservatives. Believe me, it is useful to get that learned. This was one of those Covington Catholic moments, when the latent contempt liberal elites have for social and religious conservatives comes right to the surface.\n\nWarren\u2019s views on same-sex marriage are popular; nearly two out of three Americans support it. That number is going to rise as older Americans, those least likely to oppose it, die off. Transgender is still a divisive category. Strong majorities of Americans favor allowing transgender soldiers to serve in the military, but the question of trans bathroom use remains divisive. The fact that an older liberal feminist like Hillary Clinton has problems with it, and that her 39-year-old daughter not only supports it, but shows anger at her mom not embracing it, is telling.\n\nMy sense is that the national media are going to have a huge blind spot on covering the political implications of the clash between LGBT rights and religious liberty. Again, if a religiously conservative presidential candidate \u2014 Sen. Josh Hawley, maybe \u2014 had given the same kind of response that Warren did, it would be widely perceived as a gaffe. If she\u2019s the Democratic nominee, I doubt Elizabeth Warren stands to win too many votes of religious conservatives. But what her contempt for religious conservatives who have not embraced LGBT rights to the extent that she has will energize religious conservatives to vote against her.\n\nAnd believe me, a non-trivial number of religious conservatives are sick and tired of Donald Trump, and are open to voting against him, or at least withholding their votes. I heard a speech that the Southern Baptist pastor Russell Moore delivered on Friday evening. It did not mention politics at all, and certainly not Trump, but it was a sermon about power, faith, and responsibility. As one of the nine religious conservatives left in America who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do at the ballot box in 2020, it challenged me deeply in my thinking. Elizabeth Warren and Beto O\u2019Rourke have made the cost of standing against Trump, or not standing up for him in the ballot box, significantly higher.\n\nWe will see what the other Democrats have to say about this issue on Tuesday night \u2014 provided that the moderators ask them about it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-13-at-6.29.47-PM-e1571009412526.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
