(Picture: ITV/Rex)\n\nOlivia Olson almost didn\u2019t make it to The X Factor Celebrity live shows after her first audition \u2013 as she admitted she let her \u2018nerves\u2019 get the better of her.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who rose to fame as Joanna Anderson on the Christmas classic Love Actually has exclusively told Metro.co.uk that she had the \u2018confidence slapped\u2019 back into her after Simon Cowell shut her first audition down by telling her \u2018it wasn\u2019t great\u2019.\n\n\u2018I am very excited about the live shows. but after seeing my audition I did let the nerves get to me,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018I think it slapped the confidence back into me because I wasn\u2019t confident going into it. On the first song that I sang it wasn\u2019t the best representation of my voice and my talent so when Simon was like \u201cit wasn\u2019t great can you do something else?\u201d I was like \u201coh I really have to show up now\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was expecting a different reaction from the judges at the time but I also expected myself to do something different than I did, so I think it was fitting.\u2019\n\nOlivia\u2019s first audition didn\u2019t go to plan (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nYou may remember Olivia as the little girl from the popular Richard Curtis movie, who belts out All I Want For Christmas in the unconventional school nativity play before she was chased down through Heathrow Airport by lovable stalker Thomas.\n\nHowever, the 27-year-old has assured us while she won\u2019t be singing Mariah Carey on the show, she doesn\u2019t want to just be known for Love Actually.\n\nYou may remember Olivia from this film (Picture: Universal Pictures)\n\nShe added: \u2018It\u2019s a funny thing because back home it\u2019s not something I have experienced because I am more famous for the animated work I do now.\n\n\u2018But coming to the UK where it\u2019s such a beloved film I feel like it\u2019s very much the centre of everyone\u2019s focus but I am like \u201cno I have done other things\u201d.\n\n\u2018I am proud that I was in the movie as it was the start of my career but since I have had the best of both worlds because in my work I can use my singing and acting.\n\n\u2018I have been out of the limelight I guess, because it\u2019s the characters that are famous and not me.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOlivia may be used to the \u2018sun and heat\u2019 back home, and despite it being rainy and cold in the UK she revealed she feels \u2018very comfortable here\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former actress also admitted that when she met her fellow contestants she \u2018didn\u2019t know who a lot of them were\u2019.\n\n\u2018Being American you don\u2019t get a lot of the television channels that you get over here so a lot of the TV personalities I didn\u2019t know,\u2019 she added.\n\n\u2018I was going into it blindly a bit. I didn\u2019t know what to expect but it has exceeded whatever expectation I did have.\u2019\n\nJenny Ryan from The Chase will also be performing on the live shows after she was initially axed by judge Nicole Scherzinger at the auditions \u2013 however soon after it was announced they were bringing her back.\n\nOlivia exclaimed that it was completely \u2018justified\u2019 that producers brought Jenny back on the show.\n\nShe said: \u2018I think it was pretty shocking for everyone when she got eliminated but we are happy to have her back because she deserved to go on the live shows.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s such a fair game at this point, the producers picked such a diverse group of contestants, everyone is really talented, I am surprised by the level of talent that turned up at the stage, so I can\u2019t wait to see what everyone brings.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nX Factor: Celebrity continues airs on Saturdays at 8.20pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
