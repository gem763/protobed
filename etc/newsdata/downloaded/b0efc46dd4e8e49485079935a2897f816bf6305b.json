For the moment I think this is more about job-saving, not job-creating,\u201d said Richard Rossow, an India expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nEconomists and finance ministry officials expect India\u2019s spending plans to mean it will miss its fiscal deficit target this year and be pushed to borrow. That will pile stress on state finances and make any boost in infrastructure spending, which can be a source of quick employment for rural migrants, unlikely.\n\nAlthough broadly welcomed by businesses, electronics manufacturers are so far among the few to indicate the tax cuts would be enough to trigger investment as they seek to hedge their bets amid the China-U.S. trade war.\n\n\u201cThe psychological stimulus from this \u2018New Deal\u2019 will be higher than the fiscal stimulus,\u201d said V.K. Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist with Geojit Financial Services.\n\n\u201cWHY ARE COMPANIES ARE SHUTTING DOWN?\u201d\n\nWith an estimated 1.2 million youth entering India\u2019s labour market each month, Modi has made job creation a priority in his \u2018Make in India\u2019 plan, but manufacturing has been sluggish.\n\nIndia\u2019s auto sector has laid off about 350,000 workers this year, while Parle Products, a major Indian biscuit maker, recently warned it may shed some 10,000 workers.\n\nJewellery designer Shaji Balan said he was laid off in June after his employers sold their factory. The father of three secured another job, but it pays half of what he used to earn, so he has joined the gig economy delivering food for online service Swiggy.\n\n\u201cToo many people are jobless. Why are companies shutting down?\u201d said Balan.\n\nAlthough markets surged after the tax announcement on Friday they have already given back some gains, with investors waiting to see if there is more to come.\n\n\u201cFurther structural reforms to the labour market, land acquisition and regulatory environment,\u201d would help generate sustainable growth, said Arnab Das, global market strategist at Invesco in London.\n\nEconomists and business leaders who see low wages and depressed crop prices as playing big parts in India\u2019s economic slowdown would have preferred measures to stimulate consumption.\n\nThe tax cut \u201cis a welcome move by the government,\u201d said Mayank Shah, category head at biscuit maker Parle, but he added that a goods and services tax (GST) cut to reduce prices for consumers would have had a more significant impact.\n\nAt least some of the unemployment growth, business leaders say, is tied to two of Modi\u2019s major economic reforms from his first term - demonetisation to tackle unaccounted wealth and the nationwide rollout of a goods and services tax - both of which caused short-term pain with the promise of long-term gain.\n\nIndia\u2019s economic woes have not yet dented Modi\u2019s popularity. He won a sweeping mandate in May\u2019s general election despite worries over jobs.\n\nDelivery of basic public services, like toilets or cooking gas, as well as recent steps curtailing restive Kashmir\u2019s autonomy have resonated with Modi\u2019s base, according to Rossow of CSIS.\n\nIndia\u2019s 2019/20 planned gross borrowings were already the highest in at least nine years, and with the latest measures are expected to increase further.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A combo shows unemployed people posing in front of a chalkboard with their qualifications during a job fair in Chinchwad, India, February 7, 2019. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo\n\nHowever, India is not thinking of revising its fiscal deficit target in the near future and isn\u2019t thinking of spending cuts either, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.\n\nBut bond yields have already spiked and economists doubt India can maintain its fiscal deficit target, which stands at 3.3% of GDP for the current financial year.\n\n\u201cCompanies\u2019 gains are the government\u2019s losses,\u201d Nomura said in a note to clients, adding it did not expect any \u201cmeaningful\u201d impact on economic growth in the short-term. \u201cHowever, this is a medium-term positive step.\u201d", "description": "With one eye on flagging demand, businesses in India are likely to bank the government's $20.4 billion corporate tax windfall rather than unleash the investments that Prime Minister Narendra Modi hopes will create millions of jobs and revive the economy.", "authors": ["Alexandra Ulmer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433749535&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O12Q", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
