They said he appeared to have acted alone.\n\nGreater Manchester Police\u2019s assistant chief constable, Russ Jackson, said the suspect is believed to be a British citizen from the Manchester area.\n\n\u201cWe do not know the motivation for this terrible attack. It appears random, is certainly brutal and of course extremely frightening for anyone who witnessed it,\u201d Jackson told reporters.\n\nJackson said the stabbing attack, deemed a terrorism offense, \u201cwas bound to bring back memories of the awful events of 2017,\u201d when a radical Islamist killed 22 people and injured hundreds more at pop singer Ariana Grande\u2019s concert at Manchester Arena. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi died in that attack; his brother is on trial for conspiring to cause the blast.\n\n\n\nArmed police surround the Arndale shopping center, where a man stabbed five people on Oct. 11, in Manchester, England.

Britain\u2019s MI5 service, the domestic counterintelligence and security agency, is also monitoring the case.\n\nWitnesses at the shopping center told Britain\u2019s PA Media that a man tried to slash people, seemingly at random.\n\nA shop worker, who identified himself only as Jordan, 23, told the news agency, \u201cA man was running around with a knife lunging at multiple people, one of which came into my store visibly shaken with a small graze.\u201d\n\nJordan said, \u201cSoon after, security staff told all retail staff to close their doors and move the public to the back of the stores.\u201d\n\nFreddie Houlder, 22, was in the Arndale mall when he heard \u201ca load of screams just outside\u201d the store he was in.\n\nHoulder told PA Media that a woman came into the shop and told others that \u201ca guy just ran past the shop and tried to stab me.\u201d\n\nHoulder said, \u201cLuckily she had quite a thick jacket \u2014 she thought originally it was a fake knife because of how easily it grazed off, but police came in and said it was a real knife and she burst into tears.\u201d\n\nJackson said two unarmed police officers confronted the attacker, who chased them with the knife.\n\nImages on social media showed a man in a puffer jacket on the ground, with one police officer holding his wrists and a second officer standing over him with a stun gun.\n\nThe mall has undergone major renovations since 1996, when it was damaged following an attack in which the Irish Republican Army detonated a 3,300-pound device nearby.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the stabbings. \u201cThank you to our excellent emergency services who responded and who are now investigating what happened,\u201d Johnson tweeted.\n\nKarla Adam contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nGunman live-streamed attack outside German synagogue that left two dead\n\nSuspect in Paris police stabbings had ties to Islamist extremist networks, prosecutor says\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Greta Thunberg win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Three victims were rushed to the hospital with knife wounds.
