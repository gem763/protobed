(Oct. 1) AP Entertainment\n\nMaybe we don't need another reason to gush over celebrity couple Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, but why wouldn't you want to?\n\nThey're just so #couplegoals, and you can put them on your vision boards for 2020 if that's still a thing. If not, they're reason alone to revive them.\n\nET caught up with Timberlake, 38, in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. He deflected some of the attention onto his wife, Jessica Biel, star of \"The Sinner.\"\n\nTimberlake said Biel, the mother of his son, Silas, 4, has changed him \"in so many ways.\" They married in 2012 and announced the birth of their son, Silas Randall, in 2015.\n\n\"It's like once you find that person, it's like a baptism, where you're like, 'I can't go back,' you know what I mean?\" Timberlake said.\n\nLast year, Biel helped him through a rough time when he had to cancel shows because of bruised vocal chords and was put on voice rest.\n\n\"To have somebody by your side to really go through it with you and get in the mud with you, so to speak, I'm sure you know what that's like,\" he said.\n\nThis month, the couple stood strong as they were the target of a celebrity prankster at Paris Fashion Week. Vitalii Sediuk jumped out of the crowd and tried to tackle Timberlake who had arrived with Biel. Biel was confused but held tight to her husband's hand as security led Sediuk away.\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson\n\nREAD\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/15/justin-timberlake-compares-life-jessica-biel-and-son-baptism/3984767002/", "description": "Marriage to Jessica Biel and fatherhood were such profound events that Justin Timberlake compared them to a baptism, saying he can't \"go back.\"", "authors": ["Sonja Haller", "Published P.M.
