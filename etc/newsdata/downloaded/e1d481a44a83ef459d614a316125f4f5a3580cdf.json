But her dad, who insisted on buying her brown dolls, wanted her to know that rich, brown skin was just as beautiful as alabaster or any shade of the rainbow.\n\nShe recounted a time when she was called ugly by another kid on the elementary school playground.\n\n\u201cMy daddy says I\u2019m beautiful,\u201d she responded. Then she pulled out of her small purse that was otherwise filled with rocks a business card.\n\n\u201cYou can call my dad and ask him,\u201d she added.\n\nCummings, her daughter said, did not suffer fools.\n\n\u201cAnd you taught me not to either,\u201d she said.\n\nHillary Clinton: 'He kept reminding us, life is no dress rehearsal'\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it\u2019s no coincidence that the late Rep. Elijah Cummings shared a name with the Old Testament prophet Elijah, who used the power and wisdom God gave him \u201cto uphold the moral law that all people are subject to.\u201d\n\nIn remarks that seemed a thinly veiled reference to President Donald Trump, Clinton got a huge applause from the mourners when she said that Cummings, like that Old Testament prophet, \u201cstood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he kept reminding us, life is no dress rehearsal,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton said Cummings had the simple philosophy that no matter how daunting a problem seems, there\u2019s always something each person can do, even if it seems small.\n\nToward the end of his life, Cummings begged the American people to pay attention to what was going, Clinton said.\n\n\"'When we\u2019re dancing with the angels, the question will be asked,' he said, in 2019, 'what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?,'\" Clinton said.\n\nShe ended with paraphrase of a poem Cummings recited in his first speech to Congress and would repeat to himself as many as 20 times a day as a reminder to make the most of every moment on Earth.\n\n\u201cI have only just a minute. Only sixty seconds in it,\u201d the poem begins. \u201cJust a tiny little minute, but eternity is in it.\u201d\n\nFormer first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivers remarks during the funeral service for Rep.

North Star. Mr. Chairman.\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., spoke about the late Maryland Democrat's role as a mentor to incoming lawmakers.\n\n\u201cAs we know from the Old Testament, there is a tradition to leave a seat at the table for Elijah. He might show up,\u201d she said. \u201cOur Elijah always made a seat at the table for others. He made a seat at the table for children who need education, for even new members of Congress so he could mentor them. For all who wanted to be part of the American Dream. Elijah himself personally lived the American Dream and he wanted everyone else to have that opportunity and many seats at the table.\u201d\n\nCummings was a close advisor, someone she said she looked to for direction and whose candor was always welcome \u201cwhether we asked him or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe held himself to a high standard,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I called him the North Star of Congress, our guiding light.\u201d\n\nAn all-star audience of mourners\n\nElijah Cummings can still draw a powerful crowd.\n\nTwo ex-presidents, a former first lady, presidential candidates, former cabinet members and countless members of Congress - of both parties - showed up to pay their respects.\n\nBarack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton headlined the group but here are some of the others who came:\n\nPresidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nMembers of Congress including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (a fellow Marylander), John Lewis, Adam Schiff, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republicans Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan.\n\n'He was a good man'\n\nThousands stood outside for hours in brisk, 50-degree weather, waiting to pay respects to Rep. Elijah Cummings, who died Oct. 17 at age 68.\n\nThe line snaked throughout the front of New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, where Cummings' funeral was held Friday. The church holds a maximum of 4,000 people, and employees warned that many would not be able to get inside.\n\nThe ceremony, which will include remembrances by former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, started at 10 a.m. EST.\n\nMary Roary told her friend Carla Fennell that she hoped she had enough tissues as the pair waited to say goodbye to Cummings, who represented parts of Baltimore in Congress for 23 years.\n\nThe women both had fond memories of the longtime congressman, including once when Fennell says Cummings helped her, a single mother, find a job.\n\n\u201cHe was a good man. It\u2019s clear from looks at this line,\u201d she said motioning toward the massive number of people in line.\n\n'Enough is enough': The moments that defined the career of Rep.

Many took photos of a large blanket with Cummings\u2019 face and an American flag that was hung up just outside the hall.\n\nMany swayed or sang along with their arms raised in the air to Baptist worship music and traditional hymns.\n\nAs a video played documenting Cummings\u2019 life, from his time as young boy to his career in Washington, many grabbed tissues to wipe their eyes.\n\nHere is part of the MASSIVE line to pay respects to Rep.

Elijah Cummings' legacy and life will continue to be honored Friday morning, as former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are set to speak at the late-congressman's funeral.\n\nCummings laid in state in Statuary Hall Thursday, making him the the first black lawmaker to do so in the Capitol. Cummings, who represented portions of Baltimore, died last week at 68 due to complications related to longstanding health issues.\n\nIn addition to Obama and the Clintons, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who Cummings succeeded in a special election in 1996, will give remarks at Cummings' funeral.\n\nThe funeral will be held at the New Psalmist Baptist Church, where the late-congressman worshiped for nearly 40 years. A public viewing will take place at 8 a.m. ET and the funeral will take place at 10 a.m.\n\nObama spokeswoman Katie Hill said in a tweet Wednesday night that the former president was asked by Cummings' widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, to \"deliver remarks about the remarkable life and legacy of one of this country\u2019s finest public servants.\" Cummings was an early supporter of Obama's 2008 presidential run and was personal friends with the former president.\n\nObama said in a statement following Cummings death last week that the Maryland Democrat showed the \"necessity of good people stewarding\" the checks and balances within the United States' democracy.\n\n\"Steely yet compassionate, principled yet open to new perspectives, Chairman Cummings remained steadfast in his pursuit of truth, justice and reconciliation,\" Obama said in the statement. \"It's a tribute to his native Baltimore that one of its own brought such character, tact and resolve into the halls of power every day.\"\n\nBill Clinton in a statement last week said Cummings \"was a resounding voice of moral courage who fought the good fights for the people of Baltimore.\" In a statement last week, Hillary Clinton said Cummings was \"a man of principle who championed truth, justice and kindness. He fiercely loved his country and the people he served.\"\n\nFriday's funeral follows several days of memorials for Cummings. Mourners paid respects to Cummings on Wednesday as his body lay in repose at Morgan State University, a historically black college in Cummings' district. He served on the school's Board of Regents for 19 years.\n\nOn Thursday morning, family, friends and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle gathered on Capitol Hill to pay tribute.\n\nPelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Mark Meadows were among several attendees who made remarks Thursday.\n\nMeadows, R-N.C., passionately described his friendship with Cummings, his eyes glistening as he held back tears.\n\n\"Some had classified it as an unexpected friendship,\" Meadows said of their bipartisan relationship in a highly partisan era. \"But for those of that know Elijah, it\u2019s not unexpected.\"\n\nCummings casket was open to the public to view following the memorial service. Hundreds lined up Thursday afternoon to say their final goodbyes to the late-congressman.\n\nCLOSE Members of the public are paying their respects to the late Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, as his body lies in state outside the House chamber where he served for 23 years.
