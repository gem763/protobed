I know I certainly have. But it was disappointing that Smith had a chance to make a statement about the way he wants his side to play the game and chose to go the other way.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: winning is important. But the longer you play this game the more you realise that some things are too valuable to spoil.\n\nBrendon McCullum believes Steve Smith will one day look back at the dismissal of Ben Stokes at Lord's\n\nMcCullum thinks it was disappointing because Smith had chance to make a statement about how his side play\n\nAccording to McCullum Smith showed his immaturity by not withdrawing his appeal during Saturday's game\n\nAustralia captain Smith and England's Eoin Morgan argue about the Stokes dismissal at Lord's on Saturday\n\nBy not withdrawing the appeal, Smith showed his immaturity. He may live to regret it.\n\nI say that from experience, not because I want to have a pop at Smith. There was a Test match where I ran out Muttiah Muralitharan while he was celebrating his partner Kumar Sangakkara\u2019s hundred. I\u2019d have done that differently now.\n\nBut I do wonder how Michael Clarke would have handled the situation had he still been in charge. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d have withdrawn the appeal. I\u2019m also pretty sure that Eoin Morgan would have done so, too.\n\nAs for the current New Zealand side, I reckon none of us would have appealed in the first place.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to set us up as being holier-than-thou. I just know how much we\u2019ve discussed the way we want to play the game. Something would have told us that appealing for obstructing the field in those circumstances wasn\u2019t right.\n\nWHO ELSE FELL FOUL OF LAW 37? ENGLAND\u2019S Len Hutton is the only man to be out \u2018obstructing the field\u2019 in a Test, at The Oval against South Africa in 1951. Stokes is the first England player to be given out this way in an ODI and the sixth ever, joining FOUR Pakistanis: Ramiz Raja (Pak) v England, Karachi, Nov 20, 1987. Mohinder Amarnath (Ind) v Sri Lanka, Ahmedabad, Oct 22, 1989. Inzamam-ul-Haq (Pak) v India, Peshawar, Feb 6, 2006. Mohammad Hafeez (Pak) v South Africa, Durban, Mar 21, 2013. Anwar Ali (Pak) v South Africa, Port Elizabeth, Nov 27 2013.\n\nMy instant reaction when I saw the dismissal was that Stokes was trying to protect himself. The slow-motion replays become irrelevant, because it was a split-second decision by him to stick his glove out.\n\nThe fact that the ball hit him in the meat of the hand doesn\u2019t look good. But if he\u2019s good enough to stop the ball from a few yards away with his head turned, he\u2019s playing a different game to the rest of us!\n\nI found it odd that two experienced on-field umpires felt the need to go upstairs to their TV colleague, especially after they\u2019d signalled that they thought Stokes was not out. The protocol will need looking at.\n\nBut in a sense none of that matters. What is more important is the way cricket is played. And I felt Smith got it wrong.\n\nThe key for England now is not to get too emotional about the whole thing. I remember an incident at The Oval in 2008, when we were fuming about the run-out of Grant Elliott, who had been knocked to the ground by Ryan Sidebottom.\n\nAustralia look on as Morgan (C) and Smith exchange words with umpire Kumar Dharmasena on Saturday\n\nBen Stokes vents his anger after being given out for obstruction after Mitchell Starc threw the ball at the wicket\n\nWe obviously felt an injustice had been done but looking back we didn\u2019t cover ourselves in glory with the way we celebrated on the balcony after we won the game off the last ball.\n\nOur emotions got the better of us and it\u2019s up to Morgan now to make sure England move on and focus on Tuesday's game in Manchester.", "description": "BRENDON MCCULLUM: It\u2019s probably too early in Steve Smith\u2019s captaincy career to appreciate this but one day he\u2019ll look back at the Ben Stokes dismissal at Lord's on Saturday.", "authors": ["Brendon Mccullum For Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/06/22/2BFFFB3D00000578-0-image-a-87_1441574770270.jpg", "published_at": "2015-09-06"}
