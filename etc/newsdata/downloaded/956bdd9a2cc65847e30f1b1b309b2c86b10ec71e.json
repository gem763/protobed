People ask me: Do you really forgive Mahathir? Look, he did his part. You can\u2019t deny the fact that he did contribute to the last phase of this change to unseat Najib at the last elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to decide what is best\u2026 and best is to move on, forget the past, forgive,\u201d Anwar added. \u201cOtherwise it is a disease of the heart.\u201d\n\nTo great laughter from the audience, he added that the biggest shock he experienced upon being freed was learning about Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nRead also: From prison to palace: a recap of Anwar\u2019s first day as a free man after being granted a full royal pardon\n\nConstant succession questions \u2019embarrassing\u2019 for Mahathir: Anwar\n\nWhen pressed to confirm a May 2020 handover date, the PKR head was noncommittal and said he did not appreciate the constant questioning around handover details.\n\nHe added it was \u201cquite embarrassing\u201d to see PM Mahathir slapped with questions on his retirement at every media session, adding that the premier had been consistent and unambiguous about a government transition and identifying Anwar as his successor.\n\n\u201cSometimes he\u2019ll say: \u2018in three years\u2019, or \u2018two years\u2019, but that is Mahathir. You can\u2019t change him at 94,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is fair to go harping (on it), knowing it is next year.\u201d\n\nRead also: \u2018I will not go beyond three years\u2019, Mahathir says of PM post, confirming that Anwar will succeed him\n\nHe added that he had majority support needed to become PM, and that Mahathir was aware of party leaders\u2019 sentiments.\n\nThe former deputy PM also suggested that Mahathir was reluctant to announce a specific date for the handover to avoid becoming a lame-duck Prime Minister.\n\nThe term refers to an outgoing politician who has lost power due to the election of a successor.\n\nAnwar said he had no reason to question Mahathir\u2019s sincerity, adding that he would patiently wait for the role.\n\n\u201cI happen to be one of the most patient people\u2026 I have been known as the Prime Minister-in-waiting since 1999,\u201d he added, again to laughter.\n\n\u201cWaiting for a few more months or years is not a question,\u201d he added. \u201cInshallah (God wiling), it will happen.\u201d\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - \"I\u2019m a happy man.
