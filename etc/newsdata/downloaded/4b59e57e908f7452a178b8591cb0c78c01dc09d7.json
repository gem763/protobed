Middle-schoolers are getting hooked on the products, too.\n\nNathan Gibson, a student in the Arlington Public Schools job- and life-training skills program, suggested jacking up the price on e-cigarettes to make them harder for young people to afford.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKaine said that could help drive down e-cigarette sales.\n\n\u201cThe heavy taxation on cigarettes has made it tougher and tougher,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t there, at a minimum, be an even playing field? A fairer, higher price might keep some of the kids from doing this.\u201d\n\nVirginia imposes a cigarette excise tax of 30 cents per pack. The national average is $1.81 per pack, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. E-cigarettes aren\u2019t subject to the same tax in Virginia.\n\nIn October, Virginia confirmed the first death of a resident attributed to a severe lung injury after vaping. Most, but not all, of the people who have fallen ill nationally have used illicit THC, health authorities say. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there are at least 1,479 lung-injury cases and 33 deaths linked to vaping.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginia middle- and high-schoolers said they\u2019re afraid of the consequences of vaping.\n\nKamal Mazhar started the advocacy group Teens Against Vaping in response to the epidemic. He and a friend got the idea in a bathroom at Chantilly High School.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to use the bathroom, but it was basically flooded with a bunch of people using e-cigarettes,\u201d Mazhar, 17, said. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Okay, we have to stop this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMazhar\u2019s Instagram page, @teensvsvaping, features news stories and facts about the pocket-size, flash-drive-shaped devices. They can even be recharged in the USB ports of computers.\n\n\u201cWe put out information and any sort of facts and news in a way that is appealing for teens,\u201d Mazhar said. \u201cWe want to counteract that in the same way by putting out information through social media.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe roundtable discussion at Montessori Public School of Arlington was Kaine\u2019s second attempt to work with students on issues surrounding e-cigarette use.\n\nAD\n\nIn Harrisonburg, a town about 120 miles south of Arlington, the senator recalled: \u201cThey\u2019re grappling with, \u2018How do we help a 14-year-old break an addiction?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cKids smoking in the bathroom used to be a huge problem and then for 10 years it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s flooding back in.\u201d\n\nE-cigarettes entered the marketplace about a dozen years ago and became a sensation among young people a few years later, according to an advisory from the surgeon general. The devices were advertised as a way to wean smokers off tobacco.\n\nAD\n\nBut public heath groups have blasted e-cigarette companies for promoting their products to teenagers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that [the companies market] directly at children with all those flavors, like mint and mango, so it\u2019s marketing specifically toward this age group,\u201d said Noor Long, a 13-year-old student at Williamsburg Middle School. \u201cBecause of that, I\u2019ve noticed that cases are becoming more widespread because of all these flavors.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLast month, President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration would ban all flavored e-cigarettes \u2014 except tobacco-flavored ones \u2014 in an effort to stem the increase in youth vaping. Juul Labs, a leading e-cigarette company, on Thursday said it would suspend sales of its mango-, creme-, fruit- and cucumber-flavored e-cigarette pods in the United States.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI give the Trump administration praise on that,\u201d Kaine said.\n\nDetails of the federal government\u2019s ban on flavored e-cigarettes haven\u2019t been issued yet and it\u2019s unclear how long the proposed ban would last, Kaine said.\n\nOne student, Lukas Rist, said he feels companies target him. He\u2019s 13.\n\nThe Williamsburg middle-school student described walking into a convenience store and seeing advertisements on the front door.\n\n\u201cThe Juul sticker is down by the door handle where all the little, younger kids can see it,\u201d the student said. \u201cAnd then when you got to checkout at the counter, there\u2019s like that Juul box where they have the pods and everything. It\u2019s not on the wall in the back where the adults can see it, no, it\u2019s right there where younger kids can see it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParents on Friday said they need more education, too.\n\nTeenagers sometimes charge their vaping devices at school \u201cbecause nobody recognized,\u201d said Mila Vascones-Gatski, a substance abuse counselor at Yorktown High School. \u201cThese parents don\u2019t know that these are vapes. They are not aware of the technology, so this is the perfect storm.\u201d\n\nStudents at the roundtable said they understood the risks of vaping. They\u2019re worried about their peers.\n\nCarole French suggested using social media as a way to deliver information. They want to hear stories about people their age overcoming addiction, not statistics.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re young,\u201d Noor said, \u201cwe really take note of the emotional aspect of things.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Students and Sen.
