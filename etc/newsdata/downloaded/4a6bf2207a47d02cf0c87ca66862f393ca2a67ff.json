Its coach, Tom Osborne, was famous for convincing blue-chip boys to walk on to his team rather than accept scholarships elsewhere. The roster was 180-strong, filled with players from small Nebraska towns who grew up paying tribute to Cornhusker football each autumn Saturday.\n\nThose days are just a memory now. Nebraska entered the 2019 season after back-to-back 4-8 campaigns. The Cornhuskers are currently 3-1, but not a single player on this year\u2019s roster is old enough to remember the 1997 season when their coach, Scott Frost, quarterbacked Nebraska to its most recent national championship.\n\nFrost, in his second year as head coach, is attempting to bring Nebraska football back to relevance by building his roster the same way his former coach did: by focusing on in-state recruiting and resurrecting the university\u2019s moribund walk-on tradition.\n\n\u201cCoach Osborne had figured out a formula that helped him be successful and we want to try to copy it as much as we can,\u201d said Frost in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd while Osborne\u2019s recruiting tactics proved wildly successful two decades ago\u2014it won him three national championships between 1994 and 1997\u2014Frost is making a big bet that the local strategy can work in the modern era of college football, in which powerhouse programs have national reach.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of players in the Midwest that don\u2019t get recruited as much, where there\u2019s plenty of talent, but it might not be developed as well as other states where they play football year round,\u201d said Frost. \u201cThose are the kids we need.\u201d\n\nThe Nebraska-centric approach also stands in contrast to the recruiting practices of this week\u2019s opponent, No. 5 Ohio State. Only 10 freshmen on the roster are from Ohio and just 7 of the 22 commits in the Buckeyes\u2019 incoming Class of 2020, currently the third best recruiting class in the nation, are from within state lines.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Frost and his staff avoid signing players from coastal states. Both of the Cornhuskers biggest stars this season, quarterback Adrian Martinez and running back Maurice Washington, hail from California.\n\nScott Frost, in his second year as head coach, is attempting to bring Nebraska football back to relevance.

But it\u2019s well short of Nebraska\u2019s championship teams, which drew about 57% of their talent from the state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a kid from inner city Omaha or a kid that\u2019s working on the Sandhills of Nebraska,\u201d said Frost. \u201cI want kids that care and are going to work hard.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Frost is rebuilding the walk-on program, which peaked around the turn of the century. He\u2019s added 28 non-scholarship players to the roster this season, bringing Nebraska\u2019s walk-on total to 71. Of those, only one has earned a scholarship, though Frost said he planned to award a handful more this week ahead of the Ohio State game.\n\nThe Cornhuskers pioneered the practice of signing \u201cpreferred walk ons,\u201d players that were heavily recruited by Osborne\u2019s staff but not promised scholarships. The title was coveted; young men regularly turned down scholarships to play in Lincoln, where the coaches guaranteed them an equal chance of earning playing time as the blue-chippers. Many won scholarships, starting spots and berths in the National Football League.\n\nAccording to Joel Makovicka, a preferred walk-on fullback who started during in 1997 and 1998, the non-scholarship players\u2019 hunger to prove themselves elevated the level of competition in practice.\n\n\u201c[Walk-ons] push everybody every day,\u201d said Makovicka. \u201cCoach Frost was around the guys and the kind of chemistry that we had and the work ethic we had\u2026. It shaped him.\u201d\n\nOsborne-era practices were choreographed affairs, featuring two offensive stations for passing and running and two similarly structured stations with defensive scout teams, each large enough to make regular substitutions. That enabled every player on Nebraska\u2019s enormous roster to get significant reps, said Adam Treu, a preferred walk-on tackle-turned-long snapper who played 10 NFL seasons after graduating in 1997.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t people standing and watching,\u201d recalled Treu. \u201cThat competition is I think one of the aspects that made the football team great at the time.\u201d\n\nA series of changes around the end of the millennium shook the program to its core. The NCAA capped football scholarships at 85 in 1992, causing Nebraska\u2019s roster to contract. Fewer spots were reserved for walk-ons under coach Bill Callahan, who came to Lincoln in 2004 after nine seasons in the NFL, where practice squads never exceeded 59 players. By the time Alex Henery arrived in 2006 as a preferred walk-on kicker, all of Nebraska\u2019s 104 players fit into the locker room that once barely contained the upperclassmen.\n\n\u201cThere were different mindsets,\u201d said Henery of how Callahan approached roster building.\n\nNebraska players carry coach Tom Osborne off the field after the Huskers defeated Miami 24-17 in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 1, 1995.

He is confident that the walk-ons will one day give the Cornhuskers an edge. That, however, will take time.\n\n\u201cA lot of these [walk-on] kids need a couple years of development to catch up with some of the other guys at their position,\u201d he said. \u201cThe program when Nebraska was the best in the county wasn\u2019t built overnight and this won\u2019t be either.\u201d\n\nWrite to Laine Higgins at laine.higgins@wsj.com", "description": "Scott Frost is attempting to bring the Cornhuskers back to relevance by focusing on in-state recruiting and resurrecting the university\u2019s moribund walk-on tradition.", "authors": ["Laine Higgins", "Laine.Higgins Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-110899/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
