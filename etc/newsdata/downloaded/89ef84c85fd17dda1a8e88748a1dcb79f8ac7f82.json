Not your idea of a good time?\n\nIt's not mine either \u2013 but this is what's happening to young women in bedrooms across Britain and the rest of the Western world.\n\nYoung men are watching porn and assuming the sexual acts performed on it are what women enjoy in real life.\n\nWell, guess what? We don't.\n\nPorn isn't real life and it isn't sex education, either. Or a place to learn some great new sex moves.\n\nPorn stars actors and actresses getting paid to pretend to be having a great time.\n\nJust as male porn actors are hired for having certain attributes \u2013 big penises and an ability to become erect and climax on cue \u2013 female porn stars are chosen because they're able to cope with sexual acts that would send the average women through the roof with pain not pleasure.\n\nPorn is not an instructional guide: it's there for entertainment, not to inform.\n\nSex and relationship expert Tracey Cox has revealed how rough sex is becoming more commonplace in the bedroom, as impressionable men force women to try new moves (stock image)\n\nPain is not everyone's idea of pleasure\n\nThe intense BDSM scenes in Fifty Shades of Grey added fuel to the perception that every woman wants a 'bit of rough' and PornHub data confirms that some of the fastest growing search terms in the last four years are 'rough sex', 'hardcore' and 'bondage'.\n\nIf you're both into niche sexual practises like choking and hitting and want to include controlled violence in your sex life, go right ahead.\n\nTrue BDSM devotees talk through everything first, set rules, have safe words and take the whole consent thing very seriously.\n\nSex expert Tracey Cox (pictured) shares her advice for a successful love life\n\nBut the average woman does NOT want to be hit or hurt during sex. Behaviour like this is not the norm.\n\nHere's eight common porn activities that some men think the average women enjoys in real life.\n\nBe warned: doing these without our full consent will more likely result in an assault charge than an orgasm.\n\nHard, painful spanking\n\nBDSM vaulted the fence from niche to mainstream when Fifty Shades of Grey became popular.\n\nThe sale of insertable balls, whips and bondage gear soared \u2013 and have remained sky high.\n\nA light slap on the bottom can be arousing.\n\nBeing smacked \u2013 hard \u2013 without consent, to the point where you're so bruised afterwards you can't sit down \u2013 is something very different.\n\nChoking\n\nMy 18-year-old stepdaughter, alarmingly, said 'Oh yes, that's now a thing', when I told her what the topic of this week's column was.\n\nForced neck holding \u2013 putting one or both hands around a women's throat during sex \u2013 is something more than a few of her friends have experienced during casual sex or sex with a boyfriend.\n\nIt was not wanted or enjoyed.\n\n'They think it's OK because that's what they see in porn,' she says.\n\nActual choking is less common but still happening far too often to women who have not asked for it.\n\nMost of the young men my stepdaughter knows use porn as sex education.\n\n'They think that's how they learn about sex. One guy said to me, 'Where else am I supposed to find out what to do?'. It wouldn't occur to them to look on a reputable sex education site for tips.'\n\nTracey She has revealed the top sex moves most women don't want to be faced with, unless they have given prior consent (stock image)\n\nNo foreplay\n\nIn porn, the woman is ready, willing and gagging to go just by looking at a man's penis.\n\nIn reality, women need time to become aroused, to allow the vagina to 'tent' to make penetration both possible and comfortable.\n\nSkipping the 'warm up' and going straight into penetration \u2013 either with fingers or a penis and done forcefully \u2013 moves sex from pleasurable to painful.\n\nForeplay is not a luxury. It's rare for a woman to start sex 'warm' and one, short tongue kiss does not make a woman ready for sex.\n\nSlapping the clitoris\n\nAnother porn favourite: smacking or slapping the clitoris with a hand, a penis, fingers or an object.\n\nThe clitoris is packed with nerve endings and is extremely sensitive. Given lots of women find direct, gentle clitoral stimulation too intense, imagine how a whack would feel.\n\n'Soft, wet, slow and repetitive' is the mantra for men wanting to effectively stimulate the clitoris.\n\n'Slap' or 'smack' doesn't feature.\n\nOn the subject of slapping\u2026\n\nShe warns impressionable young men to stop using bondage inspired moves they have seen online on their partners\n\nFace slapping\n\nBeing smacked across the face is another 'thing' than men believe turns women on.\n\nCheck out popular Reddit threads on the subject and you'll find men saying women like 'the shock of it' and will climax if you do it 'just at the right moment'.\n\nEach to their own kink but, I assure you, the average woman will NOT judge a slap across the face \u2013 either in bed or out of it \u2013 as welcome or sexually enticing.\n\nDitto vigorously shoving fingers into someone's mouth.\n\nIt feels like an assault, not foreplay.\n\nDeep-throating\n\nDeep-throating \u2013 taking the whole length of a man's penis deeply into your throat \u2013 is commonplace in porn.\n\nIn reality, most women focus on the head of the penis, which is where most of the nerve endings are. They also like to be the ones in control of the depth of penetration.\n\nDeep-throating is a learned skill.\n\nDo it to someone who isn't skilled and you will trigger the gag reflex \u2013 turning a sensual act into a deeply unpleasant one.\n\nHaving anal sex without preparing for it\n\nThe anus is designed for things come out of it, not for things to be put into it.\n\nWhile lots of couple enjoy anal sex or anal play, you need to train the rectum in order for penetration to be comfortable.\n\nEven then, most couples don't practise the deep, hard thrusting you see in porn.\n\nAnother highly dangerous porn trick: moving straight from anal penetration to vaginal penetration.\n\nTracey's advice is: 'If you're a man who's desperate to know what women want in bed, ask one in real life'\n\nThe bacteria from the anus does not belong in the vagina and can cause all sorts of harmful health problems.\n\nPutting a penis straight from an anus into a mouth is even more high-risk.\n\nAll are commonplace in porn.\n\nEjaculating externally\n\nIn porn it's called 'The Money Shot': when a man ejaculates over their partner's face.\n\nPorn stars (pretend to) love it. Do it to someone who hasn't agreed to it and it's intolerable and disrespectful.\n\nWho the hell wants semen squirted into their eyes or into their hair?\n\nAny sexual act that strays even mildly from the norm needs to be talked about and checked with a partner before proceeding.\n\nIf you're a man who's desperate to know what women want in bed, ask one in real life.\n\nListen to The Tracey Cox Show on Jack Radio, Wednesday's live from 12-1pm.
