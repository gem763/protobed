Parasomnias is a category of disorders characterised by unusual behaviour during sleep, such as walking, or even talking. Less commonly, it takes the form of eating or sexsomnia, which involves undertaking sexual behaviour while asleep. Whatever form they take, the problem often comes to light only when the patient ends up injuring themselves or their bed partner. However, some patients are reluctant to seek help, not least due to the risk that doctors may accuse them of deliberately hurting their partner. Up to two per cent of adults have non-REM parasomnias, which encompass everything from muttering gibberish to preparing a meal. Rather than occurring while dreaming, these happen in slow-wave sleep, the deep restorative sleep that takes place during the first third of the night. Most parasomnias, rather than being a reflection of bad habits or poor sleep, are thought to be an early warning sign of a more serious health condition.\n\nExperts have since suggested that it is likely that Kelly was having an episode of parasomnia - a sleep disorder involving abnormal movements or behaviours including sleepwalking - at the time, having first suffered with the condition as a child.\n\nJudge Simon Hickey ordered that Kelly undergo a two-year supervision order, meaning he will undergo an alcohol awareness course and an 'adapted thinking skills programme' targeting three areas that exacerbate his condition - namely poor sleep hygiene, alcohol and stress.\n\nKelly, who had his arms behind his back as he was addressed by the judge, was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order which bans him from contacting his victim until 2024.\n\nThe order also means that, if he stays at a property other than his own in the next five years, he must tell the occupiers of the home of his parasomnia.\n\nDescribing the case as 'very unusual', Judge Hickey told Kelly: 'I judge that you do pose a real threat to the female victim and to any person who may be sleeping in the same household as you, because as yet you have yet to undergo treatment.\n\n'If you breach my order the penalties are severe - you could go to prison for up to five years.'\n\nGiving details of the programme he will undergo, the judge said it was important that it targets alcohol awareness, sleep hygiene and stress, saying: 'As a young man, these factors in my judgment could easily arise again.'\n\nKelly, who had his arms behind his back as he was addressed by the judge, was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order which bans him from contacting his victim until 2024\n\nNot guilty be reason of insanity is a 'special verdict', which can be returned when a jury believes that a defendant has committed an act but is suffering from a condition - parasomnia in Kelly's case - which means they could not have been responsible for their actions at the time.\n\nThe court heard how Kelly first started suffering from parasomnia as a child, with family members and friends saying that they had seen him walking around the home while sleeping.\n\nOn one occasion when he was a young boy, he is reported to have walked down a flight of stairs, opened and eaten chocolate before returning to bed, all while still asleep.", "description": "Dale Kelly (pictured(, of Dalton-le-Dale in County Durham, was asleep when he walked into the\u00a0couple's bedroom, climbed into their bed and started touching the woman intimately, a court heard.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19306396-0-image-a-12_1570207748133.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
