Just don\u2019t ask it which country you are going to.\n\nBowing to pressure from China, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines began to remove references to Taiwan, of which Taipei is the capital city, as a separate country from their websites Wednesday.\n\nAmerican, which was the first to make the switch, listed Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, the city\u2019s main airport, as a destination for travelers looking to book a flight on its website, with no reference to Taiwan. Delta listed only Taipei and the code for the city\u2019s airports.\n\nThe American carriers were among the last holdouts against a Chinese effort to force all airlines to drop any references to Taiwan as a separate country. Beijing regards the self-ruled democratic island as a breakaway province.", "description": "American, United Airlines, and Delta were among the last holdouts against a Chinese effort to force all airlines to drop any references to Taiwan as a separate country.", "authors": ["Sui-Lee Wee"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/26/business/26CHINAAIR/merlin_141646134_df5f6546-84da-49b3-be8f-8906b0406d42-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-25"}
