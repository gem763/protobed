Pato, 14, came to Seixal three years ago and says he finds the regime \u201cmuch tougher\u201d than at the club he left in Vila Franca de Xira, a town in the northern suburbs of Lisbon.\n\n\u201cThe demands at all levels are very high to give the young players the best possible chance of reaching the professional team,\u201d says Rodrigo Magalhaes, technical coordinator of the training centre.\n\nYet the club\u2019s focus now is to \u201cmove up a gear,\u201d Bruno Lage says. \u201cWe must be able to hold on to our young gems to become more competitive.\u201d\n\nBenfica are still waiting for their first Champions League win this season after two straight defeats against Leipzig and Zenit St Petersburg.
