The Google Fright Geist lists Spiderman and Descendants in the top five, while more stylishly, Stranger Things and Harley Quinn make the top 20 (alongside the perennial \u201csexy\u201d faves, mouse and cheerleader).\n\n\n\nThe Fright Geist tool is actually great for anyone who\u2019s been aimlessly Googling what they should dress up as this year \u2014 we don\u2019t all have Heidi Klum levels of commitment, or budget. A sheet with holes in it/wrapped toilet roll is the furthest a lot of people get. All you need to do to find your perfect costume,, click on the \u201cCostume Wizard\u201d tab and adjust the dials to come up with a tailored suggestion. After sliding the dial for \u201cSpookiness level,\u201d \u201cStyle,\u201d \u201cTrend Meter\u201d and \u201cUniqueness Level\u201d (obviously we slid all of them to the max for modernity and uniqueness, plus extra spooky), we got Zombie. Which is either totally zeitgeist-y, given the plethora of Netflix zombie content doing the rounds, or totally clich\u00e9. Still better than being a sexy mouse.\n\nThere\u2019s a very 2019 suggestion on the most Googled list, too, with \u201cVSCO girl\u201d coming in at 79 \u2014 seems like this one would be easy to assemble at home. \u201cScoops Ahoy,\u201d the ice-cream counter uniforms from Stranger Things also got a look in, with searches increasing by 300%, as did the hideous, and harder to achieve Demagorgon.\n\nSadly missing are any of i-D\u2019s Halloween suggestions, which in no particular order, include: Lizzo\u2019s Flute; The Bieber wedding; Lindsay Lohan in Mykonos; or an online listicle. These will take slightly more imagination, not being available for purchase on Yandy.com, but might be more rewarding. Or maybe just better to be the second most Googled item, a classic, which can veer sexy ,hideous, or feminist \u2014 a witch.", "description": "While 'Stranger Things' and 'It' make the list, we have some much better suggestions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9cc17dbc40a5000a2ea06c/lede/1570554618300-stranger-things.png?crop=1xw:0.995085995085995xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
