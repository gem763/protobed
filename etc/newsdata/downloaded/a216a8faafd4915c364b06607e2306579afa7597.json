Thanks to Trump, I'm doubting the Founders' plan.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-30", "text": "I now hesitate to defend the 'genius' of the Framers. I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances they said would keep us on track.\n\nThe day after Labor Day, I will stand behind a lectern in a lecture hall on the campus of Rutgers University and teach a course that I have taught for 40 years. I have always approached the first day eager to teach about the establishment of our republic and how government works today. In the past three years, the eagerness has curdled into apprehension as I debate with myself how even-handed I should be in dealing with a national government that I can no longer recognize, much less approve of.\n\nIt would be pointless for me and boring for the students to spend the semester assailing President Donald Trump for casting public service as contemptible with his unjustified disparagement of everyone from scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency to the chairman of the Federal Reserve. His contaminating influence has even spread beyond the executive branch to transform the United States Senate, an institution that I have long revered, into a pitiable amen corner that either assents to his most outrageous statements or passively cringes in silence.\n\nWhom did they learn that from?: When one of my students grows up to be a moral adult, I'm shocked. And inspired.\n\nI am now hesitant defending what I used to refer to as the \u201cgenius\u201d of the framers of the Constitution because I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances that James Madison assured us were \u201cauxiliary precautions\u201d to prevent our government from going off the rails at times when the wisdom of the American people is faulty. The faultiness of that wisdom is, in my mind, on vivid display by the man they chose to lead the nation.\n\nSerious flaws in the political system\n\nIt is hard for me now, in discussing the voting behavior of Americans, to grasp what kind of desperation prompted so many of my fellow citizens to choose and now enthusiastically support a man who has degraded the office of the presidency. How can American citizens in whom sovereignty resides have acted so irresponsibly? I will grant, however, that the alternative was not a good one. But that also speaks to serious flaws in the system.\n\nI have searched for historical examples to reassure the students, and myself, that we have sometimes made poor choices in the men we have elected president, but that the damage that they inflicted on the country was slight and things turned out all right. I find it harder these days to use these historical examples, because they were part of a different time in which partisan strife was not so intractable and there were individuals who enjoyed universal respect to whom we could turn to help right the ship. Recently, people looked hopefully on the the prospect of William Barr as attorney general \u2014 another Elliot Richardson or William Ruckelshaus perhaps \u2014 only to see him mutate into a stooge for the president.\n\nAn actor portrays George Washington in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 2017. (Photo: Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nMore distressing even than lacking good people to restore the nation such as in the aftermath of Watergate and Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation has been the failure of those exiting the Trump administration to speak openly about the mismanagement, capriciousness and venality of the president and his entourage.\n\nMany individuals who spoke privately about Trump\u2019s ignorance and caprice, such as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, slunk silently into retirement without getting on the record their obvious contempt for Trump. Even the vaunted truth-teller Defense Secretary James Mattis, whose departure was attributed to policy differences with the president, has not aired those differences so that the public could be able to evaluate whose version was the more credible.\n\nPulling my punches on Trump\n\nFew of our past presidents were wholly conversant with constitutional law, but most seemed to be wary of the electrified wires of the system of separation of powers that defined limits they dared not transgress. Attributing to President Trump the most innocent interpretation of his abuses of power, such as the recent order to American companies to leave China, he has been exposed as a constitutional imbecile.\n\nJust for the looks: My school's lockdown drills, active shooter training are security theater. Yours are, too.\n\nMore ominously, he is a man with dictatorial tendencies that exceed even of those past presidents most contemptuous of checks and balances. He has elevated the Second Amendment\u2019s protection of gun ownership to a level above that of the First Amendment\u2019s protection against the abridgment of a free press, and he tampers dangerously with the 14th Amendment\u2019s clear message on birthright citizenship.\n\nUltimately, I will probably pull my punches because I don\u2019t want to come across as a scold, and I will temper my words because I don\u2019t want to give my students the idea that all is lost. It would be truly be the worst message of all.\n\nRoss K. Baker is a distinguished professor of political science at Rutgers University and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
