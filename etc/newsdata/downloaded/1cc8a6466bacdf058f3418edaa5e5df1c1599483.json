She spoke to Harry Dunn to tell him that she would call for help', adding: 'she was 'terribly, terribly sorry for that tragic mistake'.\n\nThe mother of three is in hiding in America after flying home on a state-sponsored private jet after crashing into Harry while driving for 400 yards on the wrong side of the road outside the US spy station her husband Jonathan worked at in Britain.\n\nHarry's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn are in New York giving more interviews to US TV today before flying to Washington DC later in the hope of meeting Donald Trump or his White House team.\n\nReacting to her apology their spokesman and lawyer Radd Seiger said: 'I have seen those comments and obviously have no way of knowing whether those are indeed words which have been uttered by Mrs Sacoolas herself.\n\n'It seems odd to me that if Mrs Sacollas genuinely wishes to accept responsibility for her actions and express her regret to Harry\u2019s family, that she does not do so openly and honestly herself. Accordingly, regrettably, I am afraid that I am left with no other conclusion that this is an attempt by Mrs Sacoolas to salvage her position after the tragic collision and her family departing to the US unannounced'.\n\n'The only proper way to conduct herself is to return to the UK to face the music and to pass any information that she has to the police.\n\nIn her first account of what happened, Anne Sacoolas also said she spoke to 19-year-old Harry (pictured) at the scene before comforting her own children, who were in her car\n\nMrs Sacoolas, whose husband Jonathan worked as US intelligence official at the base, claimed diplomatic immunity and left the UK. Pictured: Harry Dunn's parents Tim, at the podium, mother Charlotte, crying into a tissue, and spokesman Radd Seiger, centre at the back, in New York yesterday\n\n'I am more than happy to meet with her to attempt to draw up a roadmap towards a potential meeting at some point in the future between the parties. I am hopeful that such a meeting between the advisers can take place in Washington DC later this week or at the weekend.\n\n'However, for understandable reasons, I have made it clear, as the family have said all along, that Mrs Sacoolas has to return to the UK and assist the police with their enquiries'.\n\nIt came as the Dunn family threatened a judicial review in the High Court asking the Foreign Office {FCO] to hand over all documents it has about the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity.\n\nThey also accused Tory Dominic Raab of being 'cold and rude' in meetings with them as they slammed the Foreign Secretary's handling of case having previously said: 'He didn't know his a**e from his elbow'.\n\n'Rude and cold' Dominic Raab 'not happy' about High Court threat, says family lawyer Dominic Raab was unhappy with a plan to take the Foreign Office to court for a judicial review into advice given by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Family lawyer Radd Seiger said that the Director of Protocol at the Foreign Office, Neil Holland, would 'welcome' the idea of handing documents over to the family's lawyers. But Foreign Minister Raab appeared less happy. He continued: 'I told Dominic Raab, I'm going to launch a judicial review - and he didn't like the sound of that. 'They were twitchy (at the meeting with the family), there were three lawyers in the room - why would you bring three lawyers into a room with a grieving mother. Why? 'There were 12 people in a room - for a meeting that was supposed to be him expressing his condolences. 'He (Mr Raab) was stiff, he was cold, he was unpleasant, he was rude. Then three days later we get another letter. That isn't right. 'The evolution doesn't happen in three days.' The FCO has been contacted for comment.\n\nRadd Seiger added: 'We are going to write to the FCO very shortly, explaining that we don't want to do a judicial review, but to avoid that, please let us have the following documents - all e-mails, messages and notes in relation to your advice to Northamptonshire Police that this lady had it [diplomatic immunity].\n\n'What we don't know is whether somebody cocked up or whether they were put under pressure by the Americans to concede.\n\n'But we want to conduct an investigation into the FCO's decision to advise Northamptonshire Police that this lady had the benefit of diplomatic immunity.\n\n'If we're not satisfied, then we'll go to a judicial review and ask a High Court judge to review it all.'\n\nMrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer, has said she wanted to meet Harry's family to 'apologise and take responsibility'.\n\nOn Saturday, before the family left for the US, they received a letter from Mr Raab, saying that Mrs Sacoolass, 42, no longer had immunity.\n\n'The letter is worded very carefully, they're not saying it's just a change of heart - they are saying that it's an evolution,' said Mr Seiger.\n\nHe also said that the family's lawyers, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC, believe 'they've (the FCO) been lying to you'.\n\nMs Charles and Mr Dunn said: 'We were astonished last Saturday to receive the hand-delivered letter from the FCO indicating that Mrs Sacoolas did not in fact have diplomatic immunity.\n\n'We were still reeling from our terrible meeting with Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary, last Wednesday, just three days earlier, where he was adamant that Mrs Sacoolas did have immunity.\n\n'Something is not right. We will not rest until we get the truth. We will not let Harry passing be in vain.'\n\nHer lawyer, Amy Jeffress, from US firm Arnold & Porter, said the diplomat's wife had stayed at the scene of the crash and flagged down other people to help the teenager.\n\nShe said: 'Anne was driving on the wrong side of the road and had no time to react when she saw the motorbike \u2013 the crash happened too fast.\n\n'Anne stayed on the scene of the accident to assist. She spoke to Harry Dunn to tell him that she would call for help. She waved down another car.\n\n'That driver pulled over and offered to assist Harry so that Anne could comfort her young children, who had been in her car and were on the scene.'\n\nThe spokesman added that Ministry of Defence police arrived shortly after the crash but it took a 'long time' for the ambulance to arrive.\n\nIt is seven weeks since Mrs Sacoolas collided with Harry's motorbike on the road outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.\n\nMrs Sacoolas, whose husband Jonathan worked as US intelligence official at the base, claimed diplomatic immunity and left the UK.\n\nIt is seven weeks since Mrs Sacoolas collided with Harry's motorbike (pictured) on the road outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire\n\nHarry's family said today they may launch a judicial review into the decision by Northamptonshire Police to give her diplomatic immunity.\n\nUS Spy's wife brings in lawyer who represents extradition suspects and used to work at US Embassy in London The US spy's wife has brought in a lawyer who is an expert in extradition cases who used to work at the American Embassy in London. Mrs Sacoolas is a Partner at Arnold & Porter, specialising in criminal defence, national security, international law. Before this, she worked for the US Justice Department at the U.S. Embassy in London Before joining Arnold & Porter, Ms Jeffress served as the Justice Department Attach\u00e9 to the US Embassy in London, where she coordinated cooperation between US and UK authorities on criminal matters.\n\nAnne Sacoolas's statement went on: 'She and her family left the United Kingdom approximately three weeks after the accident, after they and the US authorities determined that it would be difficult for the couple and their children to remain in the small Croughton community under these tragic circumstances.\n\n'She and her family returned home on a commercial flight. Our understanding is that the British authorities were informed and aware of their departure before they returned to the United States.'\n\nThis morning, former British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the U.S. had been disrespectful to the the U.K. in its handling of the issue.\n\nHe told Sky News: 'I think it was a mistake to spirit her out of the country. I think it was immensely disrespectful to Harry Dunn's family.\n\n'How would they [the U.S] feel if the boot was on the other foot? If a British diplomat's partner in America had done the same and we just spirited them out of the country.'\n\nEarly today a spokesman said the legal team would write to the Foreign Office asking for documents relating to the decision to grant Mrs Sacoolas immunity.\n\nSpokesman Radd Seiger said: 'We are going to write to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office very shortly, explaining that we don't want to do a judicial review, but to avoid that, please let us have the following documents - all emails, messages and notes in relation to your advice to Northamptonshire Police that this lady had it (diplomatic immunity).\n\n'What we don't know is whether somebody cocked up or whether they were put under pressure by the Americans to concede.\n\n'But we want to conduct an investigation into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's decision to advise Northamptonshire Police that this lady had the benefit of diplomatic immunity.\n\n'If we're not satisfied, then we'll go to a judicial review and ask a High Court judge to review it all.'\n\nThe developments came after Harry's father told of the final words he said to his teenage son as he lay fatally injured after being hit by a car.\n\nTim Dunn, who had reached the scene of the accident when Harry was still alive, said: 'I could see broken bones coming out of his arms, but he was talking. I called over and said: 'Harry, it's your dad, they are going to fix you, be calm.'\n\n'He stopped moaning and calmed then,' he told US news channel CBS, 'and a couple of minutes later one of the doctors said they needed to sedate him because he was having trouble breathing.'\n\nTim Dunn (pictured), who had reached the scene of the accident when the 19-year-old was still alive, said: 'I could see broken bones coming out of his arms, but he was talking\n\nMr Dunn told his son (pictured with mother Charlotte) he would be sedated because it was 'for the best' and said he would see him in hospital\n\nMr Dunn told his son he would be sedated because it was 'for the best' and said he would see him in hospital.\n\nThese were the last words between father and son as Harry never woke up.\n\nAfter flying to the US, Harry's parents are on a campaign to get Mrs Sacoolas to return. Speaking at a Press conference in New York, his mother Charlotte Charles said: 'She needs to do the right thing and come back and face what she has done. Face our family. Face the UK justice system.'\n\nAsked what he would say to Donald Trump, Mr Dunn said: 'I would say to him as a man, as a father, how could you let this happen? If you are a father and your child died surely you'd want that person to own up and take responsibility for their actions.'\n\nOn Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Harry's family saying that Mrs Sacoolas no longer had diplomatic immunity from potential prosecution because her husband had left his posting at the RAF base.\n\nIf Northamptonshire Police submit a file of evidence which meets the US extradition threshold, she could be extradited to face justice here.", "description": "The US law firm representing the American spy's wife, 42, pictured, insists she had 'no time to react' when the teenager came towards her on his motorbike over a hill.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/01/19717326-0-image-a-46_1571098730553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
