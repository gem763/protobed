The method, developed by Sheffield University engineers, is being used by track cleaning teams on trial routes across the country.\n\nA solution being tested by Network Rail this autumn sees dry ice pellets fired at supersonic speed in a stream of air, freezing the leaves and making them brittle (file image)\n\nEngineers hope to develop an on-board version which will automatically fire pellets at the track ahead.\n\nProfessor Roger Lewis, from Sheffield University, said the invention provides \u2018more predictable braking and traction\u2019.\n\nPassengers endured almost 6,500 hours of delays caused by leaves in 2018/19 \u2013 up 78 per cent from 3,650 hours in 2009/10, figures show.\n\nCurrently, most rail operators use an on-board system which blasts sand on to tracks to generate traction \u2013 but this leaves a damaging residue on lines.", "description": "A solution being tested by Network Rail this autumn sees dry ice pellets fired at supersonic speed in a stream of air, freezing the leaves and making them brittle.", "authors": ["Tom Payne For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/23/19417672-0-image-a-59_1570488896702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
