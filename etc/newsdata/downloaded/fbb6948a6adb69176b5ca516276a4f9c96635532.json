The whistle-blower complaint, focused on Trump\u2019s conduct in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been followed by damaging reports on the president\u2019s private conversations with other world leaders.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that the whistle-blower was a CIA officer who was at one point detailed to the White House. The complaint has become the driving motivation behind House Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began last week.\n\nTwo of the people familiar with the decision to shrink the NSC insisted it was largely rooted in both the transition to O\u2019Brien\u2019s leadership as well as Trump\u2019s desire to increase efficiency at the agency, which grew under former President Barack Obama. About 310 people currently work at the NSC.\n\nAll of the people asked not to be identified because the plan to reduce the NSC\u2019s size hasn\u2019t been made public.\n\nLate Friday, Trump re-tweeted an allegation that the whistle-blower was a CIA official who had been assigned to the NSC under President Barack Obama. Bloomberg News has not verified that assertion.\n\nThe reductions will primarily be carried out through attrition, as staffers return from assignments at the NSC to their home agencies, the people said. Many people who work at the council are career government professionals detailed from the Pentagon, State Department, and intelligence agencies.\n\nMembers of Congress have periodically sought to reduce the size of the NSC in recent years. Some lawmakers have threatened to make the national security adviser a Senate-confirmed position if the administration didn\u2019t reduce the number of people working at the president\u2019s foreign policy shop.\n\nCreated under President Harry Truman in 1947, the NSC is an interagency panel designed to provide the president with subject-matter experts who can offer advice on foreign policy.\n\nO\u2019Brien took over the NSC last month after his predecessor, John Bolton, departed the administration after high-profile disputes with Trump and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo over Afghanistan, North Korea and other matters. There was also frustration among some West Wing officials about perceptions the NSC was leaking information to benefit Bolton.\n\nEarlier this week, O\u2019Brien appointed Alex Gray, formerly the National Security Council\u2019s Oceania and Indo-Pacific security director, to be a senior adviser, according to three people familiar with the plan.\n\nGray\u2019s appointment follows that of Matt Pottinger, who is now deputy national security adviser after serving previously as the NSC\u2019s senior director for Asia.\n\nPottinger, a former journalist and Marine who joined Trump\u2019s National Security Council in 2017 and later became senior director for Asia, has been deeply involved in U.S. talks with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, and helped to plan Trump\u2019s meetings with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un.\n\n(Updates with Trump retweet, in seventh paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jennifer Jacobs in Washington at jjacobs68@bloomberg.net;Justin Sink in Washington at jsink1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Shepard at mshepard7@bloomberg.net, John Harney, Alex Wayne\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "President Donald Trump has ordered a substantial reduction in the staff of the National Security Council, according to five people familiar with the plans, as the White House confronts an impeachment inquiry touched off by a whistle-blower complaint related to the agency\u2019s work.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIjgNJ.img?h=201&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=2067&y=1397", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
