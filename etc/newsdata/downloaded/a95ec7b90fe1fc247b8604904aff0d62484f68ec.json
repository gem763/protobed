The streaming platform has acquired the global rights to the show about nothing and every single episode will be available to stream in about two years.\n\nNetflix made the announcement on Twitter Monday, writing \"Jerry & Elaine & George & Kramer & Netflix. All 180 episodes of the Emmy-Award winning Seinfeld are coming to Netflix \u2014 worldwide! \u2014 starting in 2021.\"\n\nJerry &\n\nElaine &\n\nGeorge &\n\nKramer &\n\nNetflix All 180 episodes of the Emmy-Award winning Seinfeld are coming to Netflix \u2014 worldwide! \u2014 starting in 2021 pic.twitter.com/tLvcCKH4vl \u2014 Netflix US (@netflix) September 16, 2019\n\nSo, if you're looking to rewatch your old favorites \u2014 whether it's \"The Puffy Shirt\" or \"The Soup Nazi\" \u2014 they'll all be there, you'll just have to remain patient. For now, \"Seinfeld,\" which ran on NBC from 1989 to 1998, is currently housed on Hulu.\n\nThis deal is differs from many of its other agreements, Netflix told CBS News via email. Most of the streaming service's other licensing deals are domestic only, whereas \"Seinfeld\" is global. The deal will last for five years, Netflix said.\n\n\"Seinfeld is a one-of-a-kind, iconic, culture-defining show,\" Sony Pictures Television Chairman Mike Hopkins said in a statement. \"Now, 30 years after its premiere, Seinfeld remains center stage. We're thrilled to be partnering with Netflix to bring this beloved series to current fans and new audiences around the globe.\"\n\nThe introduction of \"Seinfeld\" in 2021 will fill the gap of \"Friends,\" which will leave Netflix in 2020. After Netflix announced last December that \"Friends\" would no longer be available, angry fans berated the company, begging them to keep the beloved sitcom on the streaming platform.\n\nIn a tweet featuring a beloved \"Friends\" character played by David Schwimmer, Netflix announced an update \u2014 and no, it wasn't Ross Gellar. \"The Holiday Armadillo has granted your wish,\" Netflix wrote, sharing a screenshot from an iconic holiday episode of the show. \"'Friends'\" will still be there for you in the U.S. throughout 2019.\"\n\nWhile passionate \"Friends\" fans were staved off for a bit, HBO Max announced the show will move to WarnerMedia's upcoming streaming service in Spring 2020.\n\nPerhaps Netflix users that miss their six \"friends\" will settle for four others: Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.", "description": "All 180 episodes will be available to stream \u2014\u00a0but you'll have to wait a while", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/16/1850db63-6360-4112-90ae-2e7089e26ee0/thumbnail/1200x630/720b68cfe8193d69f996176a80a75e22/giphy.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
