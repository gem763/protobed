Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d a narrator says in the ad. \u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.\n\n\u201cAnd their media lapdogs fall in line,\u201d the narrator says over footage of Mr. Lemon, Mr. Cuomo, CNN reporter Jim Acosta, and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.\n\n\u201cThey lost the election. Now they want to steal this one. Don\u2019t let them,\u201d the ad concludes.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted the ad out on Friday, writing, \u201cI AM DRAINING THE SWAMP!\u201d\n\nCNN told The Daily Beast on Thursday that it was rejecting the ad.\n\n\u201cCNN is rejecting the ad, as it does not meet our advertising standards,\u201d a network spokesperson told the outlet. \u201cSpecifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign said CNN\u2019s response was unsurprising.\n\n\u201cCNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming, so it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re shielding him from truthful advertising too, and then talking to other media outlets about it,\u201d said Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh, The Daily Beast reported. \u201cOur ad is entirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel, and CNN wouldn\u2019t even describe to us what they found objectionable. This isn\u2019t a cable news channel anymore, it\u2019s a Democrat public relations firm.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
