His company has spent the past decade building two mines in Nunavut, which still largely lacks roads, energy grids, higher education resources and other infrastructure, and said it plans to use the experience to propound the benefits of mining.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to hear a lot more from Agnico going forward,\u201d said Boyd. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make a stronger case on the benefits of resource development, whether it\u2019s in speeches, whether it\u2019s media we do or advertising campaigns we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time Canadian companies stand up and say, \u2018look mining and energy is not all bad\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nBoyd said the difference of opinions about whether to build an extension of the Trans Mountain Pipeline \u2014 to carry oil out of Alberta \u2014 which played a central role in the elections shows that the country needs a better conversation about how its resources can be tapped to create value for everyone.\n\nBut he framed his comments, which he has made before, not as a direct response to the election.\n\nRather, Boyd said there\u2019s \u201ca vacuum\u201d of leadership in Canada\u2019s mining industry now that Barrick Gold Corp. has scaled back its head office in Toronto, and Goldcorp was acquired by Newmont Corp. Meanwhile, other large base metal miners, such as Inco, Noranda and Falconbridge were long ago purchased by foreign companies, which has reduced their influence in Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we have a responsibility to step up and fill the vacuum because we have 6,000 employees in Canada,\u201d he said.\n\nBoyd, 61, is a certified public accountant who joined Agnico in 1985 after serving as the company\u2019s outside auditor while working at Clarkson Gordon, which is now part of Ernst & Young. He rose through the company in the ensuing decades, serving as comptroller and chief financial officer before becoming chief executive in 1998.\n\nYou\u2019re going to hear a lot more from Agnico going forward Sean Boyd\n\nHe said he plans to give a speech at the Canadian Club in November on the need for Arctic strategy, and in February, to travel to Ottawa to make a similar speech. Boyd also suggested the company will launch a social media campaign but said there won\u2019t be any significant expenditures on lobbying.\n\nThe Mount Polley Dam Failure in 2014 \u2014 one of the worst environmental failures in Canadian history, which released millions of cubic litres of waste from a copper and gold mine in northern British Columbia into a lake \u2014 as well as a similar disaster in Brazil earlier this year have stained the mining sector\u2019s reputation, he acknowledged.\n\nBut Boyd emphasized that Agnico wants to make a case that Canada can responsibly extract its vast resource endowment, citing its experience in Nunavut where it has built two mining complexes.\n\n\u201cWe built this company over six decades going where people wanted us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want us there, we don\u2019t want to go, because mining is hard enough.\u201d\n\nThis May, the company opened Meliadine, an underground and open pit gold mine located on the western shores of Hudson Bay, near Rankin Inlet, in Nunavut, which it characterizes as its largest gold deposit.\n\nNext year, Agnico expects to contribute 25 per cent of the territory\u2019s gross domestic product, and Boyd emphasized the company is keen to replicate its success in other parts of Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts and investors are enamoured with its performance: Its annual capital expenditures are expected to decline from an average of US$1.05 billion in 2017 and 2018 to around US$790 million this year.\n\nEven as it adjusted its guidance on Thursday, revising its capital expenditures up from a predicted US$750 million to US$790 million, analysts such as Citi\u2019s Alexander Hacking target the price to rise an additional 18 per cent and believe it should trade at 2.5 times its net asset value.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant premium to peers but justified due to (Agnico\u2019s) quality mines in less risky jurisdictions and strong growth potential,\u201d Hacking wrote.\n\nIn the third quarter, the company posted US$311 million in cash flow, ahead of estimates of US$299 million.\n\nIts gold production is also growing from around 1.6 million ounces in 2018, to an expected 1.77 million ounces this year, and a projected 1.95 million ounces in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, on Thursday, it announced a 40 per cent increase to its quarterly dividend to 17.5 cents. It marked the sixth straight year it has increased its dividends, and seventh straight year it increased its gold production. In the past year, its stock has risen 63 per cent from $46.06 to $75.11 as of mid-day Thursday.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz", "description": "Boyd said he plans to be particularly vocal about the need for federal government investment in Canada's Arctic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
