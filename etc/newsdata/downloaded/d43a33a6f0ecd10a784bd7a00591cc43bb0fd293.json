[\u2026] The former New York mayor brought up Gulen so frequently with Trump during visits to the White House [in 2017[ that one former official described the subject as Giuliani\u2019s \u201chobby horse.\u201d He was so focused on the issue \u2013 \u201cit was all Gulen,\u201d recalled a second former official \u2013 that White House aides worried that Giuliani was making the case on behalf of the Turkish government, former officials said.\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s work in Ukraine already appears to be the basis for an ongoing criminal investigation, but the Washington Post had a stunning report overnight alleging that the former mayor also urged Donald Trump to extradite a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania, which happens to be a top priority of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nSome of this may sound familiar, largely because Fethullah Gulen and Team Trump have intersected before. During the 2016 campaign, for example, Michael Flynn wore two hats: he was advising Donald Trump on matters of national security, while at the same time he was on Turkey\u2019s payroll.\n\nAs part of his job as an agent of a foreign government, Flynn took a keen interest in Gulen \u2013 there were reports of a possible kidnaping scheme \u2013 and Flynn lied to the FBI about the whole affair. The former White House national security adviser is currently awaiting sentencing.\n\nWhat we didn\u2019t know is that Giuliani also took a keen interest in Gulen, raising all kinds of questions about why, exactly, the Republican lawyer made this such a priority.\n\nThere are a series of related questions, of course, about Giuliani running what the Washington Post described as \u201ca shadow foreign policy,\u201d even before joining the president\u2019s legal defense team.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s not just his legally dubious work in Ukraine that\u2019s of interest: there were related reports last week about Giuliani engaging in sketchy behind-the-scenes work on behalf of Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader whom American prosecutors believe played a key role in a scheme to funnel billions of dollars to Iran, in defiance of U.S. sanctions.\n\nUnder the circumstances, common sense suggests Giuliani will need a capable legal defense team of his own, but even that\u2019s more complex than it probably should be.\n\nIt was just two weeks ago when Giuliani announced that he\u2019d be represented by attorney Jon Sale, though yesterday, the former mayor said that he\u2019s no longer Sale\u2019s client. \u201cAt this time,\u201d Giuliani wrote on Twitter, \u201cI do not need a lawyer.\u201d\n\nThere appears to be some rather compelling evidence to the contrary. Indeed, while multiple news outlets have noted the criminal investigation into the New York Republican, USA Today reported overnight, \u201cU.S. counterintelligence agents have been examining Rudy Giuliani\u2019s business dealings with two men indicted last week on campaign finance charges since at least early 2019, according to a Manhattan lawyer.\u201d\n\nThose two men, of course, are Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were taken into federal custody last week, following their alleged effort to funnel illegal Russian campaign contributions to Republicans.", "description": "Giuliani was running \"a shadow foreign policy,\" even before joining Trump's legal defense team.
