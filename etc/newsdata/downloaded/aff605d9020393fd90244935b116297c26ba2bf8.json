Referee Dan Miragliotta called timeout and gave Garrett appropriate time to recuperate.\n\nEventually, Garrett gave the thumbs up and the fight resumed. Hager stuffed a takedown attempt from Garrett and turned him up against the cage. From there, Hager landed a huge knee right between Garrett\u2019s legs.\n\nAnother timeout was called, as the crumpled Garrett crashed to the canvas. Stoic and expressionless, Hager jogged back to his corner. The doctors were brought in to assess the situation, as a pool of blood formed around the face of Garrett.\n\nShortly thereafter, the ringside physicians deemed Garrett unable to continue. The bout was waved off, much to the disdain of the Mohegan Sun Casino crowd.\n\nMiragliotta deemed the knee unintentional and thus the bout was declared a no contest, rather than a disqualification\n\nThe heavyweight bout opened up the Bellator 231 main card at Mohegan Sun Arena. The main card aired on Paramount and streamed on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nUp-to-the-minute Bellator 231 results include:", "description": "He's not in the world of pro wrestling any more, but Jake Hager seemingly increased his heel status at Bellator 231.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "The Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Samano", "Matt Erickson", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jake-hager-anthony-garrett-bellator-231.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
