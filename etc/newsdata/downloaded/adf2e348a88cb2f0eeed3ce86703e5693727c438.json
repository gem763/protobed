The lawyers argued that Shin\u2019s life can be threatened while in prison, saying he is now fed minimally with liquid food supplements.Last Friday, prosecutors, including one with a doctor\u2019s license, visited Shin\u2019s residence inside the Lotte Hotel in downtown Seoul and examined his health condition. Based on the on-site examinations, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office has finally decided to defer the execution of Shin\u2019s imprisonment for a period of six months.\u201cIt has been concluded that Shin is unfit for prison life as he can hardly communicate, eat and move by himself. In case of imprisonment, his health could deteriorate rapidly, leading to his death,\u201d the prosecutors\u2019 office said.Under the current law, a stay of execution of a sentence can be permitted for a maximum of six months for seven grave reasons, including life-threatening health problems, and has to be renewed every six months.Prosecutors demanded that Shin\u2019s residence be restricted to the Lotte Hotel and hospital. Shin has been staying on the 34th floor of the Lotte Hotel in downtown Seoul since June this year.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/23193957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
