USA TODAY\n\nBill Macy, who acted alongside Bea Arthur in the sitcom \"Maude,\" has died. He was 97.\n\nMacy's friend Matt Beckoff confirmed the news in a statement to USA TODAY Friday.\n\n\"He died at 7:13pm last night in Los Angeles,\" his statement read. \"He is survived by his wife Samantha Harper Macy.\"\n\nMacy played Walter Findlay, husband to Arthur's character Maude Findlay in the \"All in the Family\" spin-off series. The series ran from 1972 to 1978.\n\nIn a post to Facebook, Beckoff called Macy \"a spitfire right up to the end.\"\n\n\"My buddy. Gonna miss you Bill,\" he added.\n\nMacy was born Wolf Garber on May 18, 1922, to Michael and Mollie Garber in Revere, Massachusetts. He had a long career in the theater and film before \u201cMaude,\u201d including as an original cast member of the 1969-72 New York stage sensation \u201cOh! Calcutta!\u201d that featured fully nude actors. He was in the 1972 movie version of the musical about sexual mores.\n\nAmong Macy\u2019s other movie credits are 2006\u2032s \u201cThe Holiday\u201d; 1999\u2032s \u201cAnalyze This\u201d; the 1979 Steve Martin comedy \u201cThe Jerk,\u201d and 1982\u2032s \u201cMy Favorite Year\u201d starring Peter O\u2019Toole, an affectionate behind-the-scenes look at a 1950s TV variety series.\n\nMacy made dozens of guest appearances in series including \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u2033How I Met Your Mother\u201d and \u201cER.\u201d\n\nMacy, as head comedy writer for temperamental star King Kaiser (Joseph Bologna), used his gifts to great effect, as he later would while playing spouse to demanding Maude.\n\nBill Macy at the premiere of the movie \"Surviving Christmas\" on Oct. 14, 2004 in Los Angeles.

Terrill, AP)\n\nAmong them: his distinctively puffy-eyed, beset-upon expression of suffering, and an ability to slide deftly into explosive frustration.\n\n\u201cMaude\u201d also gave Macy the chance to turn serious. In one story line he descended into alcoholism and struck Maude; in another he offered tender support in a provocative episode when she decided to end an unexpected, late-in-life pregnancy.\n\nIn real life, strangers would call him \u201cMr. Maude\u201d and, presuming that he and Walter really were the same people, console him for having such a difficult wife.\n\n\u201cI used to tell them that people like that really existed,\u201d Macy once explained.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nMore: Richard Jackson, children's author and publisher of Judy Blume, dead at 84\n\nMore: South Korean pop star Sulli found dead at age 25\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/18/bill-macy-maude-husband-dead-97/4022258002/", "description": "Bill Macy, who acted alongside\u00a0Bea Arthur in the sitcom \"Maude,\" has died.
