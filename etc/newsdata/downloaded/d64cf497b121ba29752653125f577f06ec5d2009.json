In Germany there are no consecutive sentences.\n\nHe has been open with investigators about serving at Stutthof, acknowledging that he heard screams from the camp's gas chambers and watched as corpses were taken to the crematoria to be burned.\n\n93-year-old former SS guard Bruno Dey covers his face in the courtroom during his trial in Hamburg. Dey stands accused of involvement in the murder of 5,230 people when he worked at the Stutthof concentration camp near what was then Danzig, now Gdansk in Poland\n\nEfraim Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter from Simon Wiesenthal Center, pauses during an television interview at the criminal court in Hamburg on October 17\n\nWith training as a baker's apprentice, he told the court when he learned he'd been assigned to Stutthof he attempted to be assigned to an army kitchen or bakery instead, to no avail.\n\nAs a guard there, he said he had frequently been assigned to watch over prisoner labor crews working outside the camp. But, he said, he had never fired his weapon and had once allowed a group to smuggle back to camp meat from a dead horse they'd discovered.\n\nWhen he compared his standing naked before a military doctor for an exam to the prisoners standing naked for inspection in Stutthof, Meier-Goering stopped him, asking whether he didn't find his comparison a 'slap in the face' to the survivors.\n\n'It was certainly different, in any case,' he said, revising his comment. 'One can't make that comparison.'\n\nIn deference to Dey's age, the court sessions are being limited to two hours a day, and two sessions a week. His testimony is scheduled to continue Friday.", "description": "A 93-year-old German former Stutthof guard on trial in Hamburg on thousands of counts of accessory to murder testified Monday he regrets having served in a concentration camp.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028816-0-image-a-80_1571737280106.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
