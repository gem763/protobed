My dad didn't know who she was half the time, and mum didn't know who she was.\n\n'I didn't know what to do, or what to say, so I did nothing at all. Looking back now, that affected my relationship with her and my dad and I never spoke about it.'\n\nThe 39-year-old said she is now speaking about it publicly to coincide with Mental Health Month, and said people need to have the 'education' and 'awareness' that is needed to love someone like her mum.\n\nShe said that her father also battled an alcohol addiction, which she said made her in turn feel like alcohol was something that was difficult to avoid (pictured with her dad)\n\nTo this day, Alexa said she recalls walking in on her mother's suicide attempt - and it has taken her a long time to 'forgive myself'.\n\nShe said that her father also battled an alcohol addiction, which she said made her in turn feel like alcohol was something that was difficult to avoid.\n\n'My dad was an alcoholic from the time I was 16,' she previously told FEMAIL.\n\n'Even though I had an incredible relationship with my dad, I'd still be embarrassed when he would turn up to my soccer games with his hip flask of whiskey and yell the whole game.'\n\nThe personal trainer told FEMAIL that alcohol was a huge part of her early life and she had her first drink at 15, which was a hip flask of rum with all of the 'cool kids' from school (pictured now at the gym)\n\nThe personal trainer told FEMAIL that alcohol was a huge part of her early life and she had her first drink at 15, which was a hip flask of rum with all of the 'cool kids' from school.\n\nShe said that she made herself so sick that she was never able to drink rum again.\n\nDuring school Alexa would drink at least one weekend night, if not both, which would depend on how hungover she was from the previous night.\n\n'There was no set amount - I didn't have an off switch. Once I started, I found it very difficult to stop,' she previously said.\n\n'My night would end when I was so drunk that I couldn't see straight and I threw up or passed out.'\n\nDuring school Alexa would drink at least one weekend night, if not both, which would depend on how hungover she was from the previous night (Alexa pictured now)\n\nDuring university Alexa worked at bars and would drink every night she was working so she could get through the shift with a 'smile on my face' (pictured before)\n\nDuring university Alexa worked at bars and would drink every night she was working so she could get through the shift with a 'smile on my face'.\n\nShe believed that alcohol was liquid courage and made her more fun to be around.\n\n'The most terrifying part for me, was the beginnings of the craving for it during the day.

I drank his last bottle of whisky and then I danced on the tables, threw up on myself, fell in a ditch and missed my flight home,' she revealed.\n\n'I think for me, that was the pivotal point. I woke up the next day and just thought \"what the f*** am I doing? I don't want to be my dad\".'\n\nShe also didn't want her behaviour to define her, so while she was listening to her partner fill her in on the blanks from the night before, she told him she was done with drinking for good.\n\nAlthough she thinks she knew a long time ago that she had an issue, it was his death that forced her to properly acknowledge it (pictured at the gym)\n\nMore than ten years later, she still hasn't touched a drop (pictured now)\n\nNowadays, Alexa's life is filled with workouts, health and happiness - and she said she feels better than ever (pictured at the gym)\n\nMore than ten years later, Alexa still hasn't touched a drop.\n\n'Quitting drinking was the best decision, albeit the hardest one, I've ever made.
