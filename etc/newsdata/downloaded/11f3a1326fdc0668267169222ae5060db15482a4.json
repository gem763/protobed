But for Volvo the XC40 is a \u201ccar of firsts.\u201d This is the company\u2019s first all-electric vehicle. It\u2019s also the first Volvo to have an infotainment system powered by Google\u2019s Android operating system as well as have the ability to make over-the-air software updates.\n\nBefore we move on to the photos, here are some of the specs.\n\nThe XC40 Recharge is equipped with an all-wheel drive powertrain and a 78 kilowatt-hour battery that can travel more than 400 kilometers (248 miles) on a single charge, in accordance with WLTP. The WLTP, or Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure, is the European standard to measure energy consumption and emissions, and tends to be more generous than the U.S. EPA estimates. The EPA estimates are not yet available, but it\u2019s likely the XC40 Recharge will hit around the 200-mile range.\n\nThat would put the range of the Volvo XC40 Recharge below the Tesla Model 3, Chevy Bolt EV, Kia Niro and Hyundai Kona.\n\nThe vehicle\u2019s electric motor produces the equivalent of 408 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque that allows the vehicle to go from zero to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds. The battery charges to 80% of its capacity in 40 minutes on a fast-charger system.\n\nThe XC40 Recharge is expected to go on sale in the U.S. late 2020.\n\nHere\u2019s what this car of \u201cmany firsts\u201d looks like.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1898424,1898427,1898434,1898428,1898429,1898431,1898432,1898435,1898436,1898426,1898437\"]", "description": "Volvo Cars introduced Wednesday the XC40 Recharge, an all-electric vehicle that CTO Henrik Green described as \u201ca car of firsts and a car of the future.\u201d The XC40 Recharge is hardly the first electric vehicle on the market.
