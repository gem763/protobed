Young children are protected by a federal law that requires parental consent before companies can collect and share their personal information.\n\n\u201cYouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. Yet when it came to complying with the law protecting children\u2019s privacy, he said, \u201cthe company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids. There\u2019s no excuse for YouTube\u2019s violations of the law.\u201d\n\nYouTube has said its service is intended for ages 13 and older, although younger kids commonly watch videos on the site and many popular YouTube channels feature cartoons or sing-a-longs made for children.\n\nYouTube has its own app for children, called YouTube Kids; the company also launched a website version of the service in August. The site says it requires parental consent and uses simple math problems to ensure that kids aren\u2019t signing in on their own.\n\nYouTube Kids does not target ads based on viewer interests the way YouTube proper does. The children\u2019s version does track information about what kids are watching in order to recommend videos. It also collects personally identifying device information.\n\nThe vote was 3-2 by the FTC commissioners, with Simons and the two other Republicans approving the terms of the settlement and the two Democrats opposing them.\n\nCommissioner Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, noted it was the third time since 2011 that the agency had sanctioned Google for privacy violations, saying \u201cThis latest violation is extremely serious.\u201d\n\nThe illegal harvesting of children\u2019s data was \u201cextremely lucrative\u201d for Google, Chopra wrote in his dissent. Like the recent settlement with Facebook, he asserted, the Google deal has \u201cno individual accountability, insufficient remedies to address the company\u2019s financial incentives, and a fine that still allows the company to profit from its lawbreaking.\u201d\n\nExperts who study and advocate for the safety of children online decried reports of the FTC\u2019s settlement with Google that circulated last week.\n\nThe Center for Digital Democracy called the reported fine of $150 million to $200 million \u201cwoefully low,\u201d terming Google\u2019s violation of the law \u201cegregious.\u201d\n\n\u201cA small amount like this would effectively reward Google for engaging in massive and illegal data collection without any regard to children\u2019s safety,\u201d deputy director Katharina Kopp said in a statement.\n\nIndeed, the fine will barely dent Google\u2019s finances. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, made a profit of $30.7 billion on revenue of $136.8 billion last year.\n\nThe federal government has increased scrutiny of big tech companies in the last two years \u2014 especially questioning how the tech giants collect and use personal information from their billions of customers. Many of the huge Silicon Valley companies are also under antitrust investigations aimed at determining whether the companies have unlawfully stifled competition.\n\nYouTube has faced a number of child safety issues this year. In one case, comments that pedophiles left on innocuous family videos of kids pushed YouTube to turn off comments on nearly all videos featuring kids.\n\nThe FTC imposed a smaller fine of $5.7 million on video site Musical.ly, now called TikTok, earlier this year after finding it illegally collected personal information about kids.\n\nGoogle is already under a 2011 agreement with the FTC that barred it from mispresenting its privacy policy and subjected the company to 20 years of regular, independent privacy audits. Google was fined $22.5 million in 2012 for violating that settlement when the FTC found it improperly used tracking cookies on Apple\u2019s Safari browser.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s fine against YouTube now needs to be approved by a federal court in Washington.", "description": "Young children are protected by a federal law requiring parental consent before companies can collect and profit off personal information.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HK876_youtub_ZG_20190605161342.jpg"}
