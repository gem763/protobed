USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON -- Houston Astros closer Roberto Osuna listened to the taunts, the insults, the slurs and booing like he has never heard in his life Friday night, but he isn\u2019t asking for sympathy.\n\nYou may hate him, and he understands it. You may never want to forgive him, and that\u2019s ok, too.\n\nThe firestorm has overshadowed the World Series.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u2019\u2019 Osuna told USA TODAY Sports in the early morning Saturday. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I don\u2019t know what really happened that night. All I know is I got involved in something that I didn\u2019t have anything to do with.\n\n\u201cIt kind of sucks. But it is what it is, right?\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Astros won their first game of the World Series, 4-1, over the Washington Nationals, but Osuna\u2019s first appearance in the series became a story of its own.\n\nHe started warming up in the ninth, and in the seats above the bullpen, he could hear the fans screaming at him. He kept throwing until the bottom of the ninth. The left-field bullpen gate opened. He jogged onto the field.\n\nOsuna got the save in Game 4 at Nationals Park.

It was the loudest booing he has heard in his life.\n\n\u201cI was ready for it, I really was, just because of everything that happened,\u2019\u2019 Osuna said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t going to let it affect me. I just wanted to do my job.\u2019\u2019\n\nOsuna faced four batters, gave up a hit, struck out Juan Soto to end the game, and the boos came down again as he looked to the sky and started celebrating with teammates.\n\nReporters huddled around his locker after the game, and for 20 minutes, he answered questions in Spanish and English.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cPlaying in the World Series, being able to pitch tonight and help the team win, it\u2019s a good feeling.\u2019\u2019\n\nBREGMAN: 'Tomorrow, he's going off': Astros believe in struggling star\n\nSOTO: Nats phenom's 21st birthday didn't go as planned\n\nTeammates congratulated Osuna. He read text messages on his phone. He talked to friends. He then sat in his locker, quietly contemplating the evening, and spoke to USA TODAY.\n\n\u201cEverybody judges me and says things about me,\u2019\u2019 Osuna said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t know me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard for him to comprehend everything that's happened since last Saturday, when he gave up a game-tying home run in the ninth inning to New York Yankees second baseman D.J. LeMahieu in Game 6 of the ALCS. Minutes later, the homer was forgotten when his own second baseman, Jose Altuve, hit the game-winning homer to win the American League pennant.\n\nHe celebrated on the field with his teammates. He told USA TODAY Sports he was not in the clubhouse when Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman launched into a verbal tirade directed toward three female reporters.\n\n\u201cThank God we got (Roberto) Osuna! I\u2019m so (expletive) glad we got Osuna!\u201d Taubman said about six times.\n\nTaubman was taunting the reporters, knowing this was the same man who was arrested in May 2018 and charged with assault. Osuna was suspended 75 games for violating Major League Baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy and was traded two months later by the Toronto Blue Jays to the Astros.\n\nSports Illustrated wrote about the incident two days later, but Taubman insisted it was not a verbal assault; simply a show of support for Osuna. The Astros sent a scathing denial. Two days later, after MLB launched an investigation, Taubman was fired.\n\nAnd Osuna was in the middle of the ensuing firestorm.\n\n\u201cWe feel bad for him,\u2019\u2019 Astros catcher Robinson Chirinos told told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cPeople have been judging Roberto without him saying anything. People are saying it\u2019s his fault with everything going on. It\u2019s out of his hands. He was not saying anything.\n\n\u201cHe knows he made a mistake.\"\n\nMost, of course, couldn't care less about Osuna\u2019s feelings. The fact that he\u2019s pitching in the majors continues to provoke anger and hostility among segments of the Astros\u2019 fanbase.\n\nYet flawed or not, whether they\u2019re secretly upset he\u2019s even on their team, Osuna\u2019s teammates continue to publicly support him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our guy,\u2019\u2019 Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said. \u201cWhen the player walks into the clubhouse, he becomes a brother. That\u2019s how we treat everybody in here. We love each other. We try to get wins out here together, and we\u2019re a family here. We protect each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on one thing right now, and that\u2019s winning another championship. Nothing\u2019s going to distract us from that, nothing\u2019s going to take our minds away from that.\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Astros closer Roberto Osuna, pitching for the first time in the World Series since being part of team controversy, gets Game 3 save in Washington.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
