As such, it would seek approval and compliance with U.S. regulators.\n\nZuckerberg is sure that more firms will join the Libra Association\n\nRep. Juan Vargas, in turn, expressed skepticism about Zuckerberg\u2019s statement, claiming that he does not believe the Libra Association could exist without Facebook. He also expressed concerns over the fact that Libra is now formally based in Switzerland, noting that it would relieve a lot of fears if the project was based in the U.S.\n\nWhen Vargas noted that several major firms had already dropped out of the association, Zuckerberg stated that he is convinced that more companies will take interest in the project and join Libra.\n\nAs previously reported, the Libra Foundation originally counted 28 founding members. Recently, seven high-profile global firms have dropped out of the consortium, including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay, Mercado Pago and Booking Holdings.\n\nIn Libra\u2019s white paper, Facebook initially projected that the association would expand to around 100 members by the time of Libra\u2019s launch in the first half of 2020. To date, Facebook is the only firm that has financially committed to the Libra project among the 21 founding members, as reported by the BBC.", "description": "In a Congressional hearing on Oct. 23, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed confidence that a lot more firms will join Libra eventually", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9lNzkwZGFmYjdjZmRkZDRkNzVmZTFlZDUyNDBkMDcxMy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
