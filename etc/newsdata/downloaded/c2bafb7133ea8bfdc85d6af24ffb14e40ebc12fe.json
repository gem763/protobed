PAUL, Minn. (AP) - A disease spread by insects has killed a wild deer near Caledonia in Houston County of southeastern Minnesota and is suspected in the death of another deer nearby.\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources said Monday that Houston County is the second county in Minnesota where wild deer have contracted epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD.\n\nThe viral disease was confirmed in two farmed deer earlier this month near Rushford in Houston County, and in four wild deer near St. Stephen in Stearns County of central Minnesota. The state\u2019s first known instance of EHD was last October, when it killed six captive deer in Goodhue County of southeastern Minnesota.\n\nEHD is spread by a biting insect called a midge, or no-seeum. It\u2019s not considered a threat to humans, but kills deer quickly.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A disease spread by insects has killed a wild deer near Caledonia in Houston County of southeastern Minnesota and is suspected in the death of another deer nearby.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
