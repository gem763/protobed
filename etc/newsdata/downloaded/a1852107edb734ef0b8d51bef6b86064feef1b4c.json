But we're all eager to see what we can learn from this new location, Glen Etive.\"", "description": "NASA scientists have been waiting seven years to find the right place for the chemistry experiment", "authors": ["Grace Witherden", "Image", "Nasa", "Swns.Com", "Disney", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732033.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_MARS_SELFIE_005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
