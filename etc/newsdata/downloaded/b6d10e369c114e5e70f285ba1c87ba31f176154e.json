The backlash was swift. People slammed the brand for four new hoodies featuring the names of schools devastated by mass shootings: Sandy Hook, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Columbine and Virginia Tech (the image of the last one has since been deleted).\n\nThe most chilling aspect is that each hoodie is riddled with what appear to be bullet holes, recalling how nearly 100 students and staff members were killed on those school campuses.\n\nCommenters on Instagram called the designs \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201ccallous\u201d and \u201crevolting.\u201d Family members and survivors of school shootings also spoke out against the offensive garments online.\n\nKyle Kashuv, a teenage Stoneman Douglas survivor, called the designs \u201cdisgusting\u201d in the comments of one image featuring his school\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cI would just like to say, what actual the hell is wrong with you. Goddamn monetizing off a school shooting,\u201d wrote Kashuv, who earlier this year faced his own controversy over racist remarks predating the shooting.\n\nThe Instagram account for the Vicki Soto Memorial Fund, named after a teacher who died at Sandy Hook Elementary School, also criticized the brand: \u201cAs a Sandy Hook family, what you are doing here is absolutely disgusting, hurtful, wrong and disrespectful. You\u2019ll never know what our family went through after Vicki died protecting her students. Our pain is not to be used for your fashion.\u201d\n\nBstory \u2015 which was founded by designers Brick Owens and Dieter \u201cDu\u201d Grams, according to Paper Magazine \u2015 did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOwens did post a statement on his Instagram page, describing the inspiration behind the hoodies.", "description": "Family members of victims and survivors of those massacres were swift to criticize Bstroy\u2019s latest designs.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d815d59240000d3267d86f4.png?cache=QT9pE35d9P&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
