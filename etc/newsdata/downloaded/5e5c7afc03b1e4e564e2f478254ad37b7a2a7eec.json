If the measure is approved, the police commissioner will be required to provide the board with an explanation when he rejects its disciplinary recommendations. In recent years, Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill has sometimes declined to impose penalties recommended by the board, or has imposed lighter ones.\n\nThe board could also investigate and recommend discipline against an officer who makes a false statement in the course of an investigation.\n\nBallot Question 2 would also give the City Council more sway over the board, by adding two members; it currently has 13 members. One member, jointly appointed by the Council speaker and the mayor, would serve as chair; another would be appointed by the public advocate. Currently, the mayor appoints all the board members, including some nominees from the Council and the police commissioner.\n\nBallot Question 3: Yes\n\nIn recent years, most \u2014 though not all \u2014 of the corruption in New York has been found in Albany, not New York City. In large part, that\u2019s thanks to the city\u2019s strong system of campaign finance, along with a Conflicts of Interest Board that oversees violations of the city\u2019s ethics rules.\n\nThe city\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board is made up of five members, all appointed by the mayor. This ballot proposal would allow the public advocate and the comptroller to appoint two of those members instead. That could help address a gripe from some that the board has been punitive when it comes to addressing small-time violations, like misuse of a city vehicle by a city worker, while at the same time declining to take enforcement action against Mayor Bill de Blasio. The mayor was investigated for fund-raising from donors with business before the city. He was never charged with any crime.\n\nThe other two measures in the ballot question are also promising. One would require that the city\u2019s corporation counsel, who is appointed by the mayor, be approved by the City Council. This makes sense, since the corporation counsel represents not only the mayor but the City Council as well. The other would strengthen the role of the city\u2019s minority- and women-owned businesses program by requiring its director to report to the mayor . The director currently reports to a deputy mayor.", "description": "Vote yes on Questions 1, 2, 3 and 4; no on 5.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/opinion/16ballotprint/merlin_157865163_5de3d0fe-35b2-44df-a4b9-5c4dd499a35f-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
