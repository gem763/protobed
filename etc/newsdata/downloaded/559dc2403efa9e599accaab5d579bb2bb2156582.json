(Image: Columbia)\n\nWhen Lil Nas X\u2019s debut EP 7 dropped earlier this year, there was an understandable rush deep read and interpret the meanings and influences behind some of the rapper\u2019s songs \u2014tracks that seemed out of step with the \u201cOld Town Road\u201d aesthetic and energy that first made him global phenomenon. \u201cPanini,\u201d some thought, was an interpolation of Kurt Cobain\u2019s \u201cIn Bloom.\u201d\n\nBut for those of us who have an affinity for excellent cartoons, the first thing that came to mind after being introduced to \u201cPanini\u201d was Cartoon Network\u2019s Chowder, a series about an aspiring chef who\u2019s constantly trying to explain to his rabbit stalker/friend Panini that he\u2019s not in love with her. While there wasn\u2019t initially any indication that the song was a Chowder nod, the idea always seemed like a possibility given the artist\u2019s penchant for incorporating elements of camp and whimsy into his art.\n\nThe first video for \u201cPanini\u201d (which was great) came, and went, telling a story about a futuristic man who refused to leave the object of his affection alone despite her rebuffs. That very well could have been it, but the artist has just dropped yet another video for a remix of the song featuring DaBaby, and the entire animated short is right out of Marzipan City.\n\nWhat\u2019s cool about the video is that it\u2019s more or less just a retelling of the story from the original \u201cPanini\u201d video, but the story reads differently because of the dynamic that Chowder and Panini have always had. Here, Chowder (a parallel to Lil Nas X\u2019s character in the original \u201cPanini\u201d video, there a holographic dancer moving from cyberpunk advert to advert as he chased the object of his desire) isn\u2019t a man who can\u2019t take no for an answer, he\u2019s exactly the person that Panini wants \u2014 and her love grows that much more intense for him, as he does increasingly wild things to grab and keep her attention.\n\nIt turns \u201cPanini\u201d into the kind of song Panini herself would hum quietly as she concocted her latest plan to be close to Chowder, which is the kind of subtext you might not ever have expected to get from the man who brought us \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d But here we are, folks.", "description": "When Lil Nas X\u2019s debut EP 7 dropped earlier this year, there was an understandable rush deep read and interpret the meanings and influences behind some of the rapper\u2019s songs \u2014tracks that seemed out of step with the \u201cOld Town Road\u201d aesthetic and energy that first made him global phenomenon. \u201cPanini,\u201d some...", "authors": ["Catie Keck", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zrijrzjhekgttd2t6fxj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
