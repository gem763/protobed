Four suspected drug smugglers were also apprehended.\n\nThe exact location of where the boat was intercepted was not revealed.\n\n\"There are no words to describe the feeling Valiant crew is experiencing right now,\u201d said Cmdr.

Taken together, however, it is truly remarkably unprecedented.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard offloaded more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine but left the rest due to concerns about the vessel's stability. More than 12,000 pounds of cocaine was recently seized by the Coast Guard in interdictions of suspected drug-smuggling vessels off the western coasts of Mexico, Central America and South America.\n\nFox News reporter Melissa Leon contributed to this report.", "description": "The U.S. Coast Guard\u00a0said Tuesday that it had seized\u00a0a 40-foot semi-submersible\u00a0in the Eastern Pacific\u00a0Ocean that was carrying 12,000 pounds of cocaine worth more than $165 million earlier this month.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/sub.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
