It's mostly for children with special needs, there was no one there his age.\n\n(Image: Cambridge News/BPM MEDIA)\n\n\"For the last four to five weeks he's just been given presentations to go through.\n\n\"There's no experts there he can ask questions to and sometimes he doesn't always have the materials he needs.\n\n\"He's sitting his Ethics GCSE this year, he's been at school for five weeks so far and he's still not had a lesson for that yet.\n\n\"He even not allowed to go at breaktimes and lunch with the other students. He has to go eat in the canteen on his own. All because he's got the wrong trousers.\n\n\"Sadly the school seems to think his trousers are more important than his education.\"\n\nShe added: \"I actually started a petition when it started, and over 400 parents signed it but the school have not taken any notice of that.\n\n\"He's had lots of support from others. I've also made a formal complaint which is still being considered by the board of governors.\"\n\nThe school's principal, Jim Stavrou, said: \u201cSince the uniform changes were introduced, we have received much positive feedback, and many visitors, parents and staff have commented on how smart pupils look and the impression the uniform gives of the high standards at Swavesey Village College.\n\n(Image: Cambridge News/BPM MEDIA)\n\n\u201cWe want nothing more than each student to receive the highest standard of education throughout their time at the college, but sadly a single case of defiant protest against the new policy has occurred.\n\n\"Any student who does not comply with the uniform policy continue to receive a high standard of education in the college\u2019s achievement support department with other students, but away from their year group.\n\n\"This involves individual tutoring, small group work with tutors and other students, as well as re-joining their year groups for PE.\n\n\u201cWe also continue to offer different solutions to allow him to re-join lessons with his year group, including providing the uniform, but these options have been refused.\n\n\u201cAs with all policies, we will conduct a review now that the uniform has been fully implemented. This will start this term and be completed within this academic year.\n\n\"All students will continue to wear our full uniform until this has been completed.\u201d", "description": "Josh Mayer must eat alone in canteen because family wouldn't buy pricey new trousers from the school's official uniform supplier", "authors": ["Freddie Lynne", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Cambridge News Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564112.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS195688603.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
