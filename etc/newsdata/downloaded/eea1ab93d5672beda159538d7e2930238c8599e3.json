But its passage in the House of Commons is far from assured and critics accuse the government of rushing the process.\n\nThe divorce agreement needs the approval of the British and European parliaments to take effect.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s plan has already hit a number of obstacles at home since the deal was done last week. A vote to approve the accord was delayed in parliament, Johnson has been forced against his will to seek an extension, and another vote on the deal was ruled out by the House of Commons speaker.\n\nRead more: What's in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\n\u201cSecond reading\u201d vote\n\nTuesday sees a debate followed by an initial vote on the 110-page withdrawal bill, expected during the evening. In the absence so far of a vote on the deal itself, this is seen as a key decision on whether lawmakers back the agreement in principle.\n\nMinisters are said to be confident that there is enough support among MPs for the vote to succeed \u2013 just \u2013 in what would be a symbolic victory for Boris Johnson.\n\nIf the government loses, however, there is no way the deal could pass in time for the October 31 deadline.\n\nProgramme motion vote\n\nThe programme motion sets out the planned timetable to get the bill through parliament. It will be put to the vote immediately, if the first vote on the bill is passed. This looks far more problematic for the government.\n\nIt wants the whole parliamentary process to be completed in just three days \u2013 by Friday (October 25) \u2013 paving the way for Johnson to meet his Halloween deadline for Brexit itself.\n\nMany MPs have already complained that this fast-track schedule is woefully inadequate, allowing them far too little time to scrutinise the detailed text on such an important issue.\n\nIf this motion is lost, again it would mean the end of the road for the October 31 deadline.\n\nRead more: Johnson faces two crucial Brexit votes in UK parliament on Tuesday \u2013 what are they?\n\nAmendments\n\nIf the bill is passed, it would move to the parliamentary committee stage \u2013 where further dangers lurk for the government. MPs could attach amendments to the bill \u2013 which could fundamentally change the nature of the Brexit deal itself, and potentially be fatal to Johnson\u2019s plan.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow finance minister John McDonnell says in an article for the Daily Mirror that amendments give MPs an opportunity to reject the government\u2019s plan and \u201csupport an agreement that works for everyone\u201d.\n\nCustoms Union:\n\nMcDonnell identifies \u201ca new Customs Union between the UK and the EU\u201d as a proposal that \u201ccan command a majority in the House\u201d. The proposal was rejected twice when MPs held \u201cindicative votes\u201d on Brexit options in the spring \u2013 but only by narrow margins.\n\nSome Conservatives and independents who previously backed the idea are thought likely to resist it this time. An opposition alliance could see it pass \u2013 but it\u2019s not certain that those who oppose Brexit in any form would back it.\n\nIf a customs union amendment does succeed, it would amount to a far \u201csofter\u201d Brexit than the one envisaged by Boris Johnson.\n\nSecond referendum:\n\nAn amendment to put the Brexit deal to a second public vote is also likely. MPs also rejected this proposal earlier this year \u2013 the second time by only 12 votes. Labour says any deal should go back to the people. But former independent Tories are thought unlikely to support another referendum.\n\nIf either of these amendments is passed, it\u2019s thought the prime minister might respond by pulling the bill altogether and calling again for a general election.\n\nTransition period:\n\nIt\u2019s thought that opponents of a no-deal Brexit might back changes to prevent an abrupt cliff-edge exit \u2013 not on October 31, but at the end of the planned transition period at the end of 2020. Unless a free trade deal or another extension had been agreed, UK-EU trade would revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms \u2013 which many economists and in business say would be highly disadvantageous.\n\nIt\u2019s thought other potential amendments could include proposals to protect environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights.\n\nHouse of Lords\n\nIf and when it passes the House of Commons, the bill will then be put to parliament's upper chamber. The House of Lords is unlikely to approve the legislation passively and may send it back to the Commons for review.\n\nIt all amounts to a timetable that has been described as extremely ambitious.\n\nEU approval\n\nEuropean Parliament:\n\nMEPs are unlikely to approve the Brexit deal until it has been passed by the UK parliament \u2013 which could mean a vote takes place very close to the October 31 deadline. The European Parliament\u2019s Brexit Steering Group has recommended that the chamber awaits full ratification by the UK.\n\nThe parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said on Twitter: \u201cBefore we give consent all problems faced by EU27 nationals in the UK need to be solved\u201d, citing several issues.\n\nEuropean Council:\n\nThe grouping of EU national leaders, and Commission and Council presidents, has already given its green light to the deal.\n\nLeaders have been less forthcoming on the question of an extension, should the ratification process fail. Their unanimous approval is needed \u2013 but though some are known to be reluctant to back another delay, it\u2019s thought an outright refusal would be unlikely.\n\nRead more:\n\nBoris Johnson's difficult week ahead to get his Brexit deal passed\n\nWhat's in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal with the European Union?\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?", "description": "The UK government's EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill to implement the Brexit deal faces serious obstacles in the British parliament.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/03/32/1000x563_cmsv2_5619f4eb-2d3d-564b-84c1-3b2dbe5d6396-4250332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
