The six-time Pro Bowler was a key player on the defense early in the season for Los Angeles, racking up six sacks and two forced fumbles.\n\nMIKE TOMLIN DOWNPLAYS RUMORED LINKS TO WASHINGTON REDSKINS HEAD COACHING JOB\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got his jaw wired shut,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said, according to Pro Football Talk. \u201cI think he\u2019s feeling good. That\u2019s not an ideal situation. It was kind of a freak accident. He\u2019ll be out for at least the next four to six weeks. It\u2019s going to be something where you just kind of monitor that diet.\n\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s going to be a challenge any time that you have that. He\u2019ll do all the right things to put himself in a position to hopefully get back as soon as we\u2019re able to take that thing off and then he\u2019s able to fully function.\u201d\n\nOAKLAND RAIDERS' JON GRUDEN ON BROTHER JAY GRUDEN'S FIRING: 'WELCOME TO THE CLUB, BRO'\n\nMcVay said Samson Ebukam will fill Matthews\u2019 spot in the defense. The young linebacker expressed his delight with getting the chance to perform for Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI'm going to do my best to keep the seat warm for him, though, because I know what kind of an impact player that he is,\u201d Ebukam said, according to TheRams.com. \u201cDefinitely try to do my best just to live up to his reputation.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe Rams have a pivotal game against the undefeated San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.", "description": "Los Angeles Rams linebacker Clay Matthews fractured his jaw last week in his Week 5 game against the Seattle Seahawks and had his jaw wired shut as he heals from the injury.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
