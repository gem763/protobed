I said if I meet him I'll kill him. Just take into account all the people he's killed,\" Jetot said in a video interview with Le Parisien, referring to Jacques Servier, the pharmaceutical company founder who died in 2014 at age 92.\n\n\"They stole my life. I had just retired and thought I was going to begin a new life but I can't leave my house now. I can't see anyone. I get tired all the time.\"\n\nOn Monday, Francois de Castro, a lawyer for Servier, told CNN affiliate BFMTV that \"the Servier laboratory didn't know that their drug caused heart problems and it's hurtful to everyone who worked in this laboratory to be accused of having known that and not having acted.\"\n\nA 2010 report by France's national health insurance entity, CNAM, revealed that over about 30 years, as many as 500 patients may have died from complications directly related to Mediator.\n\nHowever, Agnes Fournier, an epidemiologist with the French national institute of health and medical research (INSERM), wrote a 2012 report in which she estimates the drug could have been responsible for up to 2,000 deaths.\n\nMediator was banned in Belgium in 1978, Switzerland in 1997 and Spain in 2003, according to a report presented by France's social affairs commission to the National Assembly in 2011, and the trial will examine why the pill remained available in France for so long.", "description": "A French court has heard the start of a trial involving a weight loss pill that public health officials say may have been responsible for as many as 2,000 deaths.", "authors": ["Jack Guy", "Saskya Vandoorne"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190923041839-01-weight-loss-pill-trial-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
