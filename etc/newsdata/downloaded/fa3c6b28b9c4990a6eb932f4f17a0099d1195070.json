Then they obtained Stane's DNA through undisclosed methods, and compared it to the DNA collected from a 1999 crime scene, and it came back positive, according to the Fresno Bee.\n\nCalifornia man Nickey Duane Stane, 52, was arrested on Wednesday in Visalia for a string of sexual assaults in Central California and has been named as the suspect in the cold rape and murder case of Debbie Dorian in 1996\n\nFresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer announced Stane was the suspect in Dorian's 23-year-old murder case on Friday\n\nHe was charged with sexual battery by restraint, forcible oral copulation and kidnapping to commit another crime for those attacks, according to Tulare County jail records.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to those counts and was denied bail.\n\nOn Friday Fresno District Attorney Lisa A. Smittcamp announced in a news conference the police intent to file murder and rape charges against him for Dorian's death.\n\n'Nickey Stane is every woman's nightmare. He appears to be a regular person, and he is a sexual predator who has terrorized women throughout this Valley,' Smittcamp said.\n\nOn August 22, 1996, Debbie's father Peter Dorian found his daughter, an economics student at Fresno State University, bound, gagged, raped, and murdered in her apartment.\n\nPolice never stopped the search for her killer and in 2016 the case was reopened and led by two retired department detectives Bob Schiotis and Vince Zavala who worked as a volunteer and reserve officer respectively, according to the Fresno Bee.\n\nThe case was re-opened when DNA collected from a rape investigation in Dorian's 1996 case matched DNA found from a 1999 sexual assault case in Visalia, according to Fox26.\n\nFresno police revealed that year that DNA evidence linked Dorian's killer to up to seven assaults on women in the area.\n\nOn August 22, 1996, Debbie's father Peter Dorian found his daughter, an economics student at Fresno State University, bound, gagged, raped, and murdered in her apartment.

According to social media he is divorced and a father\n\n'As technology is increasing and improving in everything that we do in our world, so is that of genetic genealogy and DNA,' Smittcamp said.\n\nDNA evidence taken from Dorian's home was found to match evidence taken from the scene of a sexual assault in Visalia. The Fresno and Visalia Police departments started to work together following new developments in the case.\n\n'I can\u2019t imagine, as a father, going into an apartment and finding my daughter bound and gagged,' the police chief Dyer said.\n\n'Any time you are able to solve a violent crime like this there is a great deal of satisfaction knowing that although you will never bring any type of closure to the family, we can at least bring them some form of justice,' he added.\n\nAccording to police, Stane's manner of attack matched up in all the assault cases.\n\nPolice say he'd approach a young woman, hide his face with the hood of a sweatshirt, threaten her with a black handgun, then sexually assault her.\n\nAccording to police, Stane's manner of attack matched up in all the assault cases.

The suspect would force the victim to expose their breasts, fondle the breasts, attempted or forced oral copulation, and masturbated during several of the crimes,' Visalia Police Chief Jason Salazar said in a October 3 press conference.\n\nHe would often attack them in public and force them into a secluded place like an alley or behind buildings.\n\nStane's previous criminal history were non-felony sexual offenses in the 1980s.

Their marriage ended before the alleged crimes were committed.\n\n'I'm shocked. I'm not defending him, but I had no clue whatsoever. I can just tell you he was a great dad to his kids. They were number one for him,' she said to ABC.\n\nThe use of groundbreaking DNA technology has cracked many cold cases in recent years, most prominently solving the decades-long mystery of the Golden State Killer.\n\nJoseph James DeAngelos was arrested for his spate of grisly murders after he was identified when cops created a DNA profile for him and matched it up with the suspect's DNA.", "description": "California man Nickey Duane Stane, 52, was arrested Wednesday for a string of sexual assaults and has been named the prime suspect in the cold 1996  murder case of Debbie Dorian/", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/16/19364556-0-image-a-41_1570377425702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
