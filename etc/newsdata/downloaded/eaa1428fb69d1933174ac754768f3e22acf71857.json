[Ammar Awad/ Reuters]\n\nHong Kong's protests started in opposition to a now-abandoned extradition bill but have widened in four months into a pro-democracy movement and anger at what they believe is China's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous territory. Beijing denies the accusation.\n\nAl Jazeera's Adrian Brown, reporting from Hong Kong, said Saturday's marches drew smaller crowds and were peaceful as compared with a rally last weekend, which spiralled into a night of running battles between protesters and police.\n\nStill, Saturday's protests \"did not pass without incident\", Brown said. \"Two metro stations were attacked. One of them had a petrol bomb thrown into it.\"\n\nThe police reported on its Facebook page that rioters tossed petrol bombs inside a Kowloon subway station, \"posing a threat to the safety of citizens\" but causing no injuries.\n\nColonial-era emergency laws were introduced a week ago banning face masks at public rallies [ Ammar Awad/ Reuters]\n\nMeanwhile, outside the police headquarters, about 200 people, many of them retirees, gathered peacefully, some shouting abuse at plain-clothes officers who did not intervene.\n\n\"The young people have already sacrificed a lot, it is about time for us, the senior citizens in Hong Kong to come forward to take up part of the responsibility from the young people,\" 63-year-old Shiu told local media.\n\n\"I mean for us, even if we are caught by the police because of an illegal gathering, I don't mind,\" said Shiu, who was identified with only one name.\n\nThere were gatherings of several hundred people in other locations, too. A rally in a shopping mall pulled together about 300 people who sang and put up protest posters.", "description": "Many wore masks, defying week-old ban that makes the use of face coverings at rallies punishable by one year in jail.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/12/c791d07ae6c14d578ff515c7dad36592_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
