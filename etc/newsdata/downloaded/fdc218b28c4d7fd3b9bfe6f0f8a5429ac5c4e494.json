And the oil industry will be no exception. From talent acquisition to courting investors, to finding new end uses for petroleum, the oil industry is facing a whole new set of challenges\u2014one that extends far beyond geopolitical risk premiums and barrel prices.\n\nOil companies who are quicker to adapt to this changing of the guard will have first pick of investment dollars and top talent, while those who are slow to change will get the leftovers.\n\nYou\u2019re Dead To Me\n\n\n\nRead some headlines (or some memes if that\u2019s more your speed). There are hundreds of headlines and one-liners that tell of the serial killing nature of millennials. The death knell has tolled so far for straws, napkins, diamonds, home buying, cable television, stock trading, and even breakfast cereal\u2014at least as we once knew it.\n\nSome of those on the dead-to-me list are there simply because they have been replaced with new technology that is simply more convenient, like the shift from cable TV to Netflix. Others wound up on the list because they were shunned by the generation that likes to take the high ground.\n\nAnd it is this high ground that has placed the oil industry in the millennial crosshairs. The image, quite simply, of the oil industry can be summed up with a single word: \u201cdirty\u201d. Oil companies wishing to woo the millennial workforce and investment dollars will have to work overtime to shed this moniker.\n\nAnd Big Oil is starting to head down this road, but it isn\u2019t quite far enough.\n\nBetween the Moral High Ground and Convenience\n\nMillennials are not just about taking the high ground. If you look at their buying and investment choices, it\u2019s not just about shunning things that are bad for the environment, bad for things or people who are exploited, or detrimental to their health. Much of the time, millennials are about what\u2019s practical or convenient. Online shopping, grocery delivery, next-day delivery, Uber Eats, Peloton, etc., are all great examples of goods and services that have met millennials where they are, instead of banging their head against the wall and trying to convince millennials they have what they want.\n\nRelated: Where Is The World's Safest Source Of Oil?\n\nCompanies who fail to live up to the generation\u2019s lofty moral ground may still be able to meet their expectations for ease of use and convenience. For oil, this is tricky, because end use is multifaceted and intertwined in the transportation, plastics, and asphalt sectors\u2014all of which the oil industry should be helping to prop up by meeting millennial needs within these sectors.\n\nFor talent acquisition, the climate unfriendly nature of the oil industry puts companies in this genre on the back foot, but the practical side of millennials gives the oil industry a rare opportunity, if they are willing to take advantage of it. Boldness and new-way pavers are needed who are not afraid to try and fail. And if oil can\u2019t convince millennials that they are climate-friendly, they most assuredly have to offer something\u2014or some things--that millennials need. This can be work/life balance, an easily climbable career ladder, work-from-home options, and premium on-the-job training. The oil industry might have a tough time convincing millennials that their jobs \u201cmean something\u201d, but they absolutely can tick all the other boxes.\n\nOther industries are already doing most of those things, and the oil industry has too. But still, oil finds itself playing second fiddle to tech, because that\u2019s just sexier. But oil and tech both have deep pockets, and the millennial generation has deep school debt. In fact, millennials have more school debt than any other generation. This is practically a marriage made in heaven. Paying off these student loans is a hot hot benefit, and has the ability to override other concerns about working in the oil industry.\n\nBig Oil Doesn\u2019t Instagram Well\n\nAre you offering this generation an experience? Because other industries are. This generation is all about the experience (which can be Instagrammed or Snapchatted), and they will choose these experiences over things any day of the week. We already know that millennials love to share pics of where they are and what they\u2019re doing, but it might be more important than many realize.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It sounds harsh, but it\u2019s true: millennials really do ruin everything.
