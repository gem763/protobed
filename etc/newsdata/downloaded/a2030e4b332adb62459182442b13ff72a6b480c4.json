A priest in Lyon, France, is alleged to be a serial pedophile, but the Catholic church hierarchy fights efforts to remove him from the priesthood, let alone bring him to justice. That was the subject area of Amy Berg\u2019s 2006 documentary \u201cDeliver Us From Evil,\u201d and, of course, of the Oscar-winning \u201cSpotlight,\u201d based on a true story, in which journalists, faced with a coverup by the Catholic archdiocese of Boston, found a widespread pattern of pastoral child abuse. Mr. Ozon\u2019s film, in subtitled French, closely follows the facts of a pending case that continues to make headlines in France. The church\u2019s evasions, obfuscations and rationalizations are shockingly familiar. But the dramatization adds a valuable dimension, vignette by intimate vignette\u2014the terrible toll exacted on victims and their families over the course of decades by a single priest who, early and quite astonishingly in the film, acknowledges his depredations in general terms to one of his victims.\n\nIn the real-life story, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, the archbishop of Lyon, received a six-month suspended prison sentence in March for his failure to report abuses, long known to the archdiocese, allegedly committed by Father Bernard Preynat, a priest who was subsequently defrocked and will face trial in a French court next year on charges of pastoral child abuse. (His attorneys tried and failed to stop the film\u2019s release.)\n\nThe script dramatizes that story through three men who, as children, had been abused when they were Boy Scouts at church-sponsored summer camps. It\u2019s a narrative with an unwieldy shape, dictated by the actual events, that resembles a relay race. One of the men sets an investigation in motion by deciding, at age 40, to go to the police and give a deposition. The police then find other victims, one of whom picks up the baton, in effect, by organizing a group that enlarges the victims\u2019 circle and goes public with demands for action.\n\nAt the outset the tone is calm and clinical. Mr. Ozon reserves his slow-burn outrage for the Catholic church\u2019s conduct; the film is not an attack on Catholicism, or religion in general. That conduct is astonishing for its shamelessness. Neither the priest nor his superiors, including the cardinal, deny his many and grievous abuses. Yet the priest sees himself as a victim\u2014of his own pedophilia\u2014and the cardinal stonewalls the investigation with vague, unkept promises to act, and with delays meant to run out the clock on France\u2019s statute of limitations. (He insists, with a perverse regard for etymology, that the term \u201cpedophile\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to his priest because, strictly speaking, it means one who loves children, and the priest did not love the children he abused.)\n\nIn a uniformly superb cast Melvil Poupaud is Alexandre Gu\u00e9rin, the initial whistleblower and a church-going family man whose calm dissolves once his old wound is opened. (\u201cGod will help it heal,\u201d Barbarin suggests, \u201cif we don\u2019t scratch too much.\u201d) Denis M\u00e9nochet is Fran\u00e7ois Debord, now an atheist and the founder of the victims\u2019 group. Swann Arlaud is Emmanuel Thomassin, who, having failed to thrive in the years following his encounter with the priest, seems the likeliest one of the three to be freed spiritually and emotionally by the priest\u2019s fall. (The cardinal and the priest are played, respectively, by Fran\u00e7ois Marthouret and Bernard Verley. ) \u201cBy the Grace of God\u201d is overlong, and loses dramatic momentum as the group works out a social-media strategy and debates potential clickbait. But Mr. Ozon\u2019s film is notable for the range of its concerns\u2014the Church\u2019s belief in redemption versus the legal requirement of punishment; the power of forgiveness versus the need for revenge; and before and after everything else, the special pain inflicted on innocent, uncomprehending children.\n\nWrite to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com", "description": "Survivors of sexual abuse try to hold a predator priest and the system that protected him to account in Fran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s powerful film.", "authors": ["Joe Morgenstern", "Joe.Morgenstern Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120318/social", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
