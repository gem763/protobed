There, the PC and printer giant announced plans to lay off 7,000 to 9,000 workers over the next three years as it sets its course toward a more software- and services-focused business model.\n\nA key element of HP\u2019s transition is a new strategy that will make consumers choose between paying for more expensive printers while gaining more flexibility in their purchase of supplies or buying subsidized hardware that will only be compatible with HP\u2019s own supplies. The move comes as HP must contend with falling market share in supplies and a rise in counterfeit inks and toners.\n\nOpinion: With yet another restructuring, HP wakes up to the realities of its struggling cash cow\n\nWells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers called the decision a \u201clargely unavoidable ... capitulation\u201d that\u2019s a net negative for HP\u2019s stock. \u201cWe think that there is growing execution risk associated with HP\u2019s realignment of its printing business and simultaneous cost-cutting efforts,\u201d he wrote, as questions remain about whether the net cost savings will really be significant amid simultaneous pressures to reinvest in its new business model. He also thinks investors will wonder whether further cost cuts are to come.\n\nHis rating on the stock is market perform, with a $20 target.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan remains skeptical of HP\u2019s prospects as the company undergoes its transition. Among his concerns are that the changes will take numerous years to execute and that HP increases its risk of hardware share losses as it tries to capture more initial value from sales of printers with more flexible supply models.\n\n\u201cWe view HP as a story where the company is taking actions to stabilize problem areas in the business (supplies) but faces headwinds from the installed base (requires investments) that detract from the gross overall restructuring savings of $1 billion,\u201d he wrote. Mohan expects macroeconomic headwinds to pressure the company\u2019s operating profit and cash flows in the meantime, he said.\n\nHe kept an underperform rating on the stock while lowering his share-price target to $16 from $17.\n\nRead: Apple reportedly asks suppliers to boost iPhone 11 output amid strong demand\n\nBernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi called the plan \u201cfraught with risk\u201d for numerous reasons. \u201cCompetitors will not follow, leaving HP as a relatively high-priced player,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHP\u2019s $13 billion supplies business runs off faster than HP can migrate its business model, which will be rolled out slowly and in a highly segmented manner.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said it\u2019s unclear that HP\u2019s ultimate business model will result in similar profit levels to its current business, and he worries that the company is facing problems beyond counterfeit supplies, including that sustainability initiatives and digital habits could be leading to a general decline in printing volumes.\n\nSacconaghi has a market perform rating on the stock and a $20 target price.\n\nFactSet shows that analysts have been overwhelmingly on the sidelines when it came to HP heading into the analyst day. Of the 16 analysts tracked by the service who cover HP\u2019s stock, 14 have hold ratings on it. One has a buy rating, and the other has a sell rating.\n\nThe stock is off 22% over the past three months, as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.90% has lost 2.2% in that time.", "description": "HP Inc. is planning a big change to its business model, but investors and analysts seem far from sold on the company\u2019s new strategy.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS687_HPlogo_ZG_20191004111656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
