While it\u2019ll work wirelessly while playing Stadia on a Chromecast Ultra, you\u2019ll have to plug in a USB-C cable to use it with computers or phones at launch, Google tells The Verge.\n\nWhen Google first showed off the controller in March, the company touted how you could seamlessly switch from gaming on your TV to a laptop or phone while using the same exact controller, without having to pair it to each device \u2014 because the controller would stay directly connected to Stadia\u2019s servers over its own Wi-Fi.\n\nBut as 9to5Google spotted earlier today, Google recently added a disclaimer in a new Stadia explainer video that wireless play will only be available on Chromecast Ultra at launch, and a Google community manager on Reddit later confirmed that meant you\u2019ll need to break out the USB-C cables for other devices \u2014 perhaps because Bluetooth also won\u2019t be an option by launch.\n\nGoogle tells us it\u2019s focusing on getting wireless play right on TV first, because it wants that big screen experience to be as good as possible. That makes sense to me \u2014 if Google wants to compete in gaming, it needs to make playing Stadia games on a TV as easy as kicking back on the couch with a PlayStation or Xbox controller.\n\nAnd purely from a logistical viewpoint, Google is probably banking on the fact that it\u2019s already much more common to plug things into our laptops, desktops, or phones, since they are usually just a few feet away from us anyway.\n\nBut right now, it seems we\u2019ll have to wait to fulfill the ultimate dream of playing triple-A console-quality games on a phone with a wireless controller and seamlessly swapping them back and forth to a TV. To be fair, Stadia is only launching for buyers of its $130 Founder\u2019s Edition package this November; it\u2019ll be more broadly available in 2020.", "description": "You\u2019ll probably be plugging in Google\u2019s wireless Stadia controller when the cloud gaming service launches on November 19th.
