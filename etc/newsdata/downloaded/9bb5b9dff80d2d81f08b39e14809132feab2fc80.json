The name of its HANA database is short for 'Hasso's New Architecture'.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Tom Hogue and Christopher Cushing)", "description": "Bill McDermott stood down on Friday after a decade building up SAP  as the world's leading enterprise software company, handing the task of completing its transition to cloud computing to new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein.
