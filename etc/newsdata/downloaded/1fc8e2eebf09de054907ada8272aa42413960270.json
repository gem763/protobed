McCarthy did not go as far as branding Marshall a traitor, but he did charge that Marshall\u2014a great war hero who helped lead the planning of D-Day and had been Time Magazine\u2019s Man of the Year in 1943\u2014led \u201ca conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man.\u201d\n\nWere old Joe McCarthy still with us he would be in awe of the lengths to which Donald Trump and his GOP and \u201cconservative\u201d lackeys have gone to discredit their perceived Democratic enemies.
