But the ban sparked some of the worst violence since protests started.\n\nThe government said it would not bring in any other emergency measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nQUIET THURSDAY\n\nShopping malls and other facilities closed early on Thursday but few demonstrators took to the streets, with only about 60 activists gathering outside one police station.\n\nBut several demonstrations are planned across the city on Friday and through the weekend, when more people have been coming out to vent their opposition over the weeks.\n\nSeveral major conferences and other events have been called off because of the protests with the latest being an annual swimming race in the city's famed harbour.\n\nProperty developer New World Development Company Limited said it was cancelling the Oct. 27 competition because of the \"social situation\".\n\nThe protest movement still appears to have a broad base of support despite the violence and vandalism carried out by small groups of front-line protesters.\n\nLam is due to deliver the city's annual policy address on Oct. 16 which traditionally contains sweeteners and support for business and investment.\n\nShe has said that due to the unrest her address would not be as \"elaborate\" or \"comprehensive\" as normal.\n\nPro-democracy lawmakers on Friday reiterated calls for authorities to address the protesters' \"five demands\" which include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into their complaints of excessive force by the police.\n\nBernard Chan, the convenor of Hong Kong's executive council - the lead advisory body to the chief executive - wrote in an opinion piece in the South China Morning Post on Friday that Lam's policy address would include responses to address the discontent.\n\nChan said the Independent Police Complaints Council should be allowed to do its own investigation into the controversy over areas such as police procedures and held out the option of an independent inquiry later.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jessie Pang and Twinnie Siu; Writing by Farah Master; Editing by Paul Tait)", "description": "Hong Kong's metro operator opened all stations on Friday for the first time in a week ahead of another round of anti-government protests, while the city's legislature began its first session since protesters stormed the building in July.
