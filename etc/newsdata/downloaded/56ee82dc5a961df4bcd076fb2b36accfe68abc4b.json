If you explain, they\u2019ll dismiss it as an excuse, and if you fight, they\u2019ll dislike you even more.\u201d\n\nLAW CHANGE CAMPAIGN\n\nKwon called for a change in the anonymous comment culture on the Internet, which critics has long blamed for cyber bullying.\n\nIn South Korea, local web portals such as Naver and Daum are a major channel of news consumption, which allow users to leave comments without revealing their real names.\n\nIn the wake of Sulli\u2019s death, fans flocked to the website of the presidential Blue House to file a petition urging the adoption of a real-name online comment system. A spate of related bills have for years been pending in parliament amid heated debate.\n\nA poll by survey firm Realmeter released on Wednesday showed nearly 70% of South Koreans supported the scheme, while 24% opposed.\n\n\u201cThe freedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else\u2019s dignity is beyond that limit,\u201d said Lee Dong-gwi, a psychology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cThere need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law.\u201d\n\nThe number of cases of cyber defamation or insult has almost doubled from 2014-18, police data shows.\n\nA member of the South Korean girl group f(x) Choi Jin-ri, also known by her stage name Sulli, is seen in this photo obtained October 16, 2019. Yonhap via REUTERS\n\nAn association of South Korean entertainment management companies issued a statement on Wednesday vowing to pursue sterner legal action for \u201cverbal violence\u201d online.\n\nKwon has now found peace thanks, in part, to painting. When she released a new single album in 2017, she even sought to express her sufferings by dousing herself with black paint on the stage like a performance artist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d gotten treatment out of desperation that I really wanted to live,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cI don\u2019t get hurt any more even though I see those malevolent online comments, but now is time to discuss it as a serious social issue.\u201d", "description": "Sulli, a former South Korean singer-actress, was a rare taboo breaker in a world where K-pop stars' every move is strictly monitored by their management, but her death has exposed the dark side of the industry that propelled a global craze.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441473261&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F121", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
