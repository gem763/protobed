Say hi to Metro.co.uk\u2019s super fun superfan series, I\u2019m Your Biggest Fan.\n\nThis week we speak with Deb Hoffman, who has been collecting Winnie-The-Pooh for the past 30 years, having her love of the character reignited in her 20s, after first receiving a plush toy when she was two.\n\nThis is quite the collection (Picture: Guinness World Records)\n\nThe 54-year-old from Wisconsin has held the Guinness World Record since 2009, after documenting thousands of items. Now she\u2019s pushing the 20,000 mark, with her collection spanning several houses and her office, where she works as a software engineer.\n\nWhat started as a small collection took on a larger meaning when Deb became addicted to getting more and more items \u2013 now people travel to see her amazing Winnie-The-Pooh assortment in her self-described \u2018Pooh Rooms\u2019.\n\nYep, she\u2019s met Pooh (Picture: Deb Hoffman)\n\nFascinating.\n\nOh, and she\u2019s still got her very first toy, 52 years later.\n\nSo, Deb, what got you into Winnie-The-Pooh?\n\nIt really started when I was a kid. I got my first when I was two-years-old, and as I got older it was always on the shelf but not a big thing.\n\nI hit my 20s and started collecting novelty telephones. There was a Winnie-The-Pooh phone, and one day it was gone. I didn\u2019t need that phone for the last six months but now it was gone, I had to have it. This was before eBay and the internet, so I put ads in newspapers across the US where I thought there might be the opportunity to find the phone. Somebody from Florida called and had the phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that, it ended up being a treasure hunt. More and more things started coming out and before I knew it, I was back into Winnie-The-Pooh even more than when I was a kid.\n\nHow did your collecting manifest?\n\nShe has nearly 20,000 items (Picture: Deb Hoffman)\n\nIt was addicting, \u201cwhat do I have to find next\u201d. That\u2019s part of really what started pulling me in.\n\nMy husband, he\u2019s supportive, he let me take one of the spare rooms as \u2018The Pooh Room\u2019. One day a friend said, \u201coh my god I bet you have the most in the world\u201d. Then I had to find out.\n\nHow did you begin to do that?\n\nIt literally took us about a year to document everything. Everything has to be unique, documented, photographed, you need two adjudicators. I\u2019ve got everything from pencils, and t-shirts to mugs, erasers\u2026 Every time you turn around I had something new.\n\nSure enough, I had the largest collection in the world. We started counting in 2008 and submitted in 2009. I\u2019ve been the record holder since then.\n\nI set it and I\u2019ve kept it.\n\nHow many items are we talking?\n\nI had 3,891 to win the first record.\n\nI collect every single day, in fact I\u2019m sitting here looking at about 30 items I have to get into the database.\n\nShe\u2019s got special rooms for the collection (Picture: Deb Hoffman)\n\nBefore those items, I now have 19,007.\n\nIt sounds like a full time job!\n\nIt really has become part of our existence, our life. So much of what we do really has to do with Winnie-The-Pooh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople say, \u201cwhen are you going to stop collecting?\u201d, it\u2019s become more about the experiences and the people we meet than the thing itself.\n\nFor one of my birthdays my husband took me over to England so I could compete in the Poohsticks Championship, visit the London Zoo and I wrote to the person who owned AA Milne\u2019s house so I toured his house.\n\nCan you calculate how much you\u2019ve spent over the years?\n\nIt\u2019s a loaded question because I\u2019ve had the great honour at having people give me gifts over the years.\n\nHer offices also sport a special room (Picture: Deb Hoffman)\n\nI\u2019ve had so many people donate items. For instance, a lady was going to be getting rid of her collection and she didn\u2019t want to send it to a thrift store, they were collectables and prized possessions.\n\nThey sought me out and I ended up driving to Ohio, about eight hours from my house, my husband rented a moving truck and we bought back 2,000 items.\n\nBut I would guess over the past 30 years, half a million dollars (\u00a3388,000).\n\nWhat\u2019s your most beloved item?\n\nOther than my first Winnie-The-Pooh? A lot of people know about the character because of Disney, which is great, and a lot of people know about the black bear cub from London Zoo, Winnie.\n\nBut a lot of people don\u2019t know that black bear cub comes from Canada and originated in White River, Ontario.\n\nShe\u2019s toured the house of author AA Milne (Picture: Deb Hoffman)\n\nAbout 20 years ago now my husband and I started going up there to a festival they hold during the weekend the bear cub was sold to Lieutenant Harry Colebourn. One of my best friends is from White River now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she found a print of the original bear cub, framed, on top of a Harley Davidson \u2013 which originated where I\u2019m from \u2013 and she gave that to me. That print means the world to me.\n\nWhere do you keep it all?\n\nI\u2019ve tried to maintain a sense of not looking like I\u2019m a nutcase where it\u2019s all over the place. It\u2019s pretty much in the one Pooh room; that\u2019s where there\u2019s an explosion. There is also a property that is our office, which has a 43 X 24 [foot] display room for more of the collection. We also have two houses, so the second house has a room that has started for Winnie-The-Pooh.\n\nHow much time do you dedicate to your collection?\n\nI have to say, it\u2019s probably a half an hour to an hour a day, looking for things, documenting. On a daily basis I\u2019m getting messages and phone calls from people who want to donate something, or have me help appraise an item.\n\nI got a phone call from someone also wants to come and tour the room.\n\nYou should start a museum!\n\nWouldn\u2019t I just love that! The one display room, people will walk into the room and stop talking because it\u2019s a sensory overload with all the colours and everything arranged. I think if I could do a museum I think it would be really popular.\n\nAnytime there is something, an interview or show, that runs, the people that will contact me to say \u201cboy!\u201d People want to be able to feel comfortable. Being a collector, they\u2019re put down for it.\n\nWhen they find someone who\u2019s done it and done it very publicly, inevitably I\u2019ll find someone who says \u201cyou made me feel good\u201d.\n\nI have people reach out to me about that, and that makes me happy that I can be an inspiration or help. I love doing that and maybe that\u2019s the reason this ended up happening for me.\n\nI\u2019m Your Biggest Fan is a weekly series that deep dives into the world of fandoms, via the people who worship the hardest.
