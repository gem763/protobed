Mere hours into the four-day journey though, I quickly learned that wasn't the case.\n\nI've taken the train between New York, Boston, and Washington, DC, more times than I can count, and even ventured out of the Northeast Corridor for a few longer journeys. But compared to many other passengers on this trip from coast to coast, I was still a novice in every sense of the term.\n\nMy companions on this 96-hour, 10-state journey from New York to Seattle, especially my fellow sleeping car passengers, were well-versed on how to survive a multiday trip by rail. Nearly every person I met had been on a sleeper before, and they were well-prepared to pass the time.\n\nUnfortunately, I was not as ready.", "description": "Four days aboard a cross-country Amtrak train was so much more relaxing than flying.
