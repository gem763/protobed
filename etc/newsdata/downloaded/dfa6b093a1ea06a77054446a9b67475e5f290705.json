U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 37 cents at $55.38.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s new energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said deeper cuts would not be discussed before a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries planned for Dec. 5 and 6.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz said, however, his country would keep cutting by more than it pledged in a deal that has throttled supply by OPEC and its allies by 1.2 million barrels per day.\n\nNigeria, Iraq and Russia have, at times, produced above their quota.\n\nA statement from OPEC and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, said oil stocks in industrial countries remained above the five-year average. Oman\u2019s energy minister said \u201cthe outlook is not very good for 2020.\u201d\n\nBoth crude benchmarks fell sharply the previous day following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump had weighed easing sanctions on Iran, a move that would potentially boost global crude supply.\n\nAlso feeding bearish sentiment, the International Energy Agency, which advises industrial economies on energy policy, said surging U.S. output would make balancing the market \u201cdaunting\u201d in 2020.\n\nThe Paris-based agency kept its oil demand growth forecasts for this and next year at 1.1 million bpd and 1.3 million bpd, respectively.\n\n\u201cThere is not a lot of room for any waiver on Iranian crude oil imports,\u201d said Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob, pointing to likely inventory builds in the first half of next year.\n\nSupporting prices earlier in Thursday\u2019s session, China and the United States made some concessions in a protracted trade war, which has weighed on oil demand forecasts, ahead of a planned meeting in coming days.\n\nAlso giving a floor to prices, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell last week to their lowest in nearly a year, as refineries raised output and imports fell.\n\nCrude inventories fell for a fourth week, decreasing by 6.9 million barrels in the week to Sept. 6 - more than double analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nAt 416.1 million barrels, U.S. crude inventories were at their lowest since October 2018, the EIA said.\n\nThe European Central Bank meets later on Thursday and is expected to ease policy to support flagging growth.\n\nGraphic on oil stocks: tmsnrt.rs/2XkQF8e", "description": "Oil prices fell on Thursday as a meeting of the OPEC+ alliance yielded no discussion about deepening supply cuts but focused instead on bringing Nigerian and Iraqi output down to their agreed quotas.", "authors": ["Shadia Nasralla", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428967461&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0D3", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
