News reports have identified him as Jean-Alessander Silvero.\n\nAuthorities say the victim was found July 11 in a motel room in Queens where security video from earlier that day captured a woman who appeared to be Barini, 41, and the man entering the location together.\n\nAfter Baraini was arrested, authorities say, she claimed she didn't know what narcotic she had brought along with her but told him it was cocaine before he snorted two or three lines.\n\nThe medical examiner ended up finding the cause of death was an overdose of fentanyl.\n\nDefense attorney Mildred Whalen and prosecutors told a magistrate judge Friday that they are negotiating a plea. Whalen didn't speak to reporters as she left court.\n\nA criminal complaint that brought initial drug charges against Barini last month links her to two other overdose deaths. One of those victims was Andrea Zamperoni, an Italian chef for a restaurant in Grand Central Terminal that's part of the renowned Cipriani chain.\n\nThe complaint alleges Barini told investigators that she was a prostitute and that she had given Zamperoni liquid ecstasy after they went to another Queens motel together in August. It says she described not being able to wake the victim after finding him bleeding from the nose and mouth.\n\nBarini told investigators that her pimp, labeled a co-conspirator in the complaint, wouldn't let her call the police and talked about trying to dispose of the body, the court papers say. She said a second co-conspirator had supplied the drugs, they add.\n\nThe medical examiner announced Friday that Zamperoni died from a combination of alcohol, cocaine and GHB, a sedative used to treat narcolepsy but also often used as a recreational drug.\n\nAuthorities say an investigation could result in more arrests.\n\nBarini is being held without bail and is due back in court on Oct. 7.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
