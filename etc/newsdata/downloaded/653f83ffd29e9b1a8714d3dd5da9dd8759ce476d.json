Any reading above 50 indicates growth.\n\n\u201cPrivate sector activity is showing signs of momentum, although panellists continue to highlight cash flow issues that they face,\u201d said Jibran Qureishi, regional economist for East Africa at Stanbic Bank.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the current stock of arrears owed to the private sector, the interest-rate-capping law could also hold back firms from flourishing on a multi-month basis.\u201d\n\nLast week, lawmakers rejected a finance ministry request to scrap commercial lending rate caps that critics say have led to a credit growth squeeze.\n\nThe rate of new business orders was the strongest in 13 months in September, the survey found, although output among firms grew modestly due to the cash flow concerns.", "description": "Kenya's private sector activity grew for the fifth straight month in September, boosted by an increase in new orders for businesses, a survey showed on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436556459&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920HF-OZABS"}
