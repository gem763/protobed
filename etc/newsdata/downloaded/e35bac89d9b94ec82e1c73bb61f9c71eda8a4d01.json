Tolkien's classic The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the firm said pre-production had started and shooting in Auckland would begin in the coming months.\n\n\"As we searched for the location in which we could bring to life the primordial beauty of the Second Age of Middle-earth, we knew we needed to find somewhere majestic, with pristine coasts, forests, and mountains,\" the firm said.\n\nNew Zealand's Economic Development Minister Phil Twyford said the project would create a range of benefits \"including jobs and significant overseas investment\".\n\nFilmed in the early 2000s by Kiwi director Peter Jackson, the Lord of the Rings trilogy pulled in nearly $3bn at the box office and won a slew of Academy Awards.\n\nThose films - along with The Hobbit trilogy - sparked a tourism boom in New Zealand.\n\nThey exposed the country's lush landscapes to the world and prompted millions of visitors to flock to the locations used.\n\nThe large-scale productions also transformed New Zealand's small film industry into a world leader, including in digital special effects.\n\nThe country has also welcomed Middle-earth as part of its cultural identity and giant models of dragons and wizards decorate Wellington airport.", "description": "The TV series produced by the US e-commerce giant has been tipped to be the most expensive ever made.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/103B4/production/_108848466_lordofrings.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
