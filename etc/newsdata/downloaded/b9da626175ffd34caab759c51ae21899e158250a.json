Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a gain of 0.1%.\n\nProducer prices were up 1.4% from September 2018, the smallest 12-month gain in almost three years.\n\nThe producer-price index typically tracks the same broad trends as other inflation measures, though it does not always translate into what consumers pay. Economists and investors will get their first glimpse at prices paid in September by the average American on Thursday, when the Labor Department releases the consumer-price index.\n\nBoth Labor Department measures feed into the inflation gauge that the Fed targets, the personal-consumption-expenditures price index, which has been below its 2% goal for most of the decade-long economic expansion. That has been a major point of concern among policy makers this year, though officials have expressed optimism in recent months that inflation was moving up toward its target.\n\nBehind the unanticipated decline in producer prices last month was an unusually large, 1% drop in trade services, a volatile measure of margins received by retail and wholesale businesses. The Labor Department defines the margin of a transaction as the difference between the acquisition price and the selling price.\n\nThe so-called core producer-price index, which excludes trade services as well as food and energy, was flat in September from August and up 1.7% from a year earlier.\n\nPrices for goods also fell last month, declining 0.4% from August. That was partly due to lower energy prices.\n\nThe Labor Department's producer-price index report can be accessed at http://www.bls.gov/ppi\n\nWrite to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nThis item was corrected at 8:47 a.m. ET to show that today's PPI data is for September, not August. Additionally, September CPI data will be relesed Thursday. An earlier version incorrectly omitted the month.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
