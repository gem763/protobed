The first was a hopeful decision. The second has got to be an informed decision.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from his home in South Armagh, he said: \u201cThe issue of Brexit was put to the people, and the people spoke.

And show that there is an alternative to the awfulness of the Tory party at the present time.\n\n\u201cPeople are craving for straight, honest and effective leadership. That\u2019s what the Labour Party should be providing.\n\n\u201cThey should not be having divided opinions on this issue. While divided opinions are essential in a political party, this is too serious.\n\n\u201cThey have to have a position, stick by it and win with it.\u201d\n\nPro-EU Labour MPs are furious about the failure to include calls for a Final Say vote on the leaked flyer for next month\u2019s European parliament elections.\n\nLabour\u2019s party conference voted in favour of campaigning for a referendum if a general election cannot be secured, but the issue remains divisive among senior figures.\n\nThere are deep divisions in the shadow cabinet over how to proceed as some frontbencher fear it could damage the party\u2019s election chances among Brexit voters in its former industrial heartlands.", "description": "One of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement has piled pressure on\u00a0Jeremy Corbyn to \u201cstop vacillating\u201d over Labour\u2018s support for a second referendum.
