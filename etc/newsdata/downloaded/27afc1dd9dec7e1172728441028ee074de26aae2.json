The fact that this was not done renders the decision to extradite unlawful, irrational and unconstitutional,\" Du Plessis said.\n\nThe matter continues.", "description": "South Africa is constitutionally obliged to ensure the effective prosecution of corruption even if the offence occurs outside of its borders, a lawyer representing the Helen Suzman Foundation has argued.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9482/b8d8d246b44c42dbb0cc0dbc6986554a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
