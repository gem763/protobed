A Look at 50 Years in Denim and Khaki", "language": "en", "text": "In 1969, Donald Fisher was a 40-year-old real estate professional who had a big problem finding Levi\u2019s that fit him properly. His solution became the Gap.\n\nFisher and his wife, Doris , opened the first location of the retail chain on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco, a s hort walk from the state university campus. For three months, the new store, named by Ms. Fisher in a nod to the generation gap , sold Levi\u2019s , especially in difficult-to-find sizes, and records . The store soon dropped the vinyl. As Mr. Fisher told The San Francisco Chronicle, \u201cThe pants were selling the records, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nBut even after the Jefferson Airplane longer-length vinyls disappeared from the shelves, a loose association with the counterculture continued to serve the chain for the next 25 years . As it grew into a corporate behemoth, the Gap\u2019s carefully engineered link with a generation of rebellious young people helped make the company into a definitive clothing brand of the American century\u2019s final quarter .\n\nThe wares sold by the Fishers were snatched up eagerly upon the store\u2019s opening. Levi\u2019s was one of the hottest brands in the country . Within the year, the Gap had opened a half-dozen other locations. Its nascent brand identity was visible in its advertising, which tried to speak the language of the tuned-in . Ads promised \u201cLevi\u2019s for cats and chicks\u201d and bragged of \u201ctasty plaids,\u201d \u201c wild bells \u201d and \u201cfar-out jeans.\u201d", "description": "From one street corner in San Francisco to every mall in America.", "authors": ["Jonah Engel Bromwich"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/21/business/21gap-ast1/21gap-ast1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
