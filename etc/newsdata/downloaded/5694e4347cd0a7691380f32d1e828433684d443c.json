He offered a similar promotion before the Astros won the World Series in 2017, which ended up costing him about $12 million in refunds, according to Houston\u2019s KHOU-TV.\n\nThis year, he estimates his losses could reach $15 million, the Houston Chronicle reported. And he has no insurance to cover that kind of liability.\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s hedging with a massive bet placed at the DraftKings sportsbook at Scarlet Pearl casino in Biloxi, Miss. It\u2019s reportedly the largest single bet in Mississippi sportsbook history, and at +220 odds, McIngvale will net about $7.7 million if it pays off.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more. ESPN reported that McIngvale has also placed large bets at a number of casinos in Las Vegas and Mississippi, and is looking to place more bets in New Jersey.\n\nWhen all the bets are placed, McIngvale is in line to win around $20 million if the Astros win, the Chronicle said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed how much DraftKings and Scarlet Peal took, and they didn\u2019t blink an eye,\u201d McIngvale told ESPN. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty rare in the sports betting business in the United States, for someone to take three and [a] half million dollars.\u201d\n\nMcIngvale, who is also a notable philanthropist, said he has to do something to stand out in a tough brick-and-mortar retail market.\n\n\u201cI know these wacky promotions like this one, when people get their money back, it\u2019s the greatest publicity I could ever hope for,\u201d McIngvale told ESPN.\n\nMcIngvale lost about $10 million in 2016 on a similar promotion when Donald Trump won the presidency. But he can afford making big bets \u2014 McIngvale\u2019s net worth is around $75 million, according to one estimate.\n\nThe Astros are the odds-on favorites to win the World Series. They\u2019ll face their first test against the winner of the Oakland A\u2019s-Tampa Bay Rays wild-card game Wednesday.", "description": "A wealthy Houston businessman has placed a massive $3.5 million bet on the hometown Astros to win the World Series \u2014 and if they win, he may need every penny.", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS448_astros_ZG_20191001224735.jpg"}
