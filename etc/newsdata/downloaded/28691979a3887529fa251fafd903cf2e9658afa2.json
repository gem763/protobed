Lallana\u2019s previous goal for Liverpool came more than two years ago, against Middlesbrough in May 2017.\n\nHe has since lost his first-team place, with two hamstring injuries limiting him to 15 appearances in 2017-18. Lallana then managed only 16 last season despite being fit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously nice to be able to contribute to a top team like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that\u2019s the first of big moments me for this season. Just because I\u2019ve not started any of the first nine games, I don\u2019t think that means I am not going to play a big part in this team.\n\n\u201cObviously I feel like I\u2019ve been fit for a good year now, especially since coming back from pre-season. But we\u2019re European champions, we\u2019ve got a top squad, so I\u2019ve had to be patient for my chance but delighted to come on and make an impact like that.\u201d\n\nAfter Liverpool defeated Tottenham in June\u2019s Champions League final Lallana indicated this could be a successful campaign for him and his belief has not wavered. He said; \u201cOf course, yeah. It\u2019s a long old season. We\u2019ve got the World Club Cup to come. We\u2019ve got the Carabao Cup next week, the Champions League this week, the Premier League at the weekend.\n\n\u201cI think the last couple of years, we\u2019ve got to the Champions League final with a maximum of four really fit centre midfielders. It\u2019s about just staying fit, staying strong and staying ready. I feel that\u2019s where my focus will be.\u201d\n\nUnited dominated large parts of Sunday\u2019s draw despite starting the match just above the relegation zone \u201cIt just shows that in this game it [form] kind of goes out the window,\u201d Lallana said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a tough game and we probably leave the happier team in the end. We could have won it \u2013 another five, 10 minutes. I thought we were controlling the game, we were dictating the game.\n\n\u201cThe last 15 minutes \u2013 when I was on the pitch you could feel that, you could feel that we got that little bit of confidence, that little bit of arrogance that we needed. We were calmer on the ball and we didn\u2019t really have that in the first half.\u201d", "description": "Adam Lallana believes his late equaliser against Manchester United can reignite his Liverpool career and again make him an integral part of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c40c18e2bc824063cc42bc5814690aff3abf4f/0_191_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a10d988c1d5f3755dfb175a050612724", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
