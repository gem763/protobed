Hynde wears her hair lighter these days, but her eyes are still as heavily kohled and fringe-buried as they were in The Pretenders\u2019 early days. \u201cSome will say \u2018Because we weren\u2019t encouraged!\u2019\u201d she continues. \u201cBut that was the whole point of being in a band, that you weren\u2019t encouraged, so you were like \u2018F*** it, I\u2019m doing it!\u2019\u201d\n\nLately she listens to women in other industries talk about the struggle of their professions, the compromises made, the sexual favours they were asked to perform. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sitting there thinking, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you just get a guitar? Why didn\u2019t you just get in a band?\u2019 A lot more girls could\u2019ve gotten in bands if they\u2019d wanted to.\u201d She repeats the lines slowly: \u201cIf they\u2019d wanted to. But they didn\u2019t want to. There is no other explanation. They just didn\u2019t want to. They probably were frankly just too busy looking after their boyfriend. That\u2019s the truth! So I\u2019m not allowed to say anything like that now, but I don\u2019t give a s***! I\u2019m the living proof!\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Hynde\u2019s opinions have at times provoked controversy. There was the time she was arrested for smearing \u201cblood\u201d across the windows of a branch of KFC, and more recently her comments on sexual assault: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to entice a rapist, don\u2019t wear high heels so you can\u2019t run from him,\u201d she told The Times four years ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re wearing something that says, \u2018Come and f*** me\u2019, you\u2019d better be good on your feet.\u201d Hynde\u2019s memoir, Reckless, had detailed her own sexual assault by the member of a motorcycle gang when she was a teenager, though she was adamant that she had played a part in encouraging his behaviour. \u201cYou can\u2019t paint yourself into a corner and then say whose brush is this?\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to take responsibility.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

After delivering a potted history of the music industry of the past 80 years, she describes the point at which \u201cMTV came along and some women realised that if they did some kind of soft porn-type videos they would get on TV and they would sell \u2013 because sex sells. And I think the standards plummeted very quickly. The interesting music then went back underground for a bit.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The 40 greatest song lyrics Show all 40 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 40 greatest song lyrics 1/40 Nirvana \u2013 \"All Apologies\" \u201cI wish I was like you / Easily amused / Find my nest of salt / Everything's my fault.\u201d As headbangers with bleeding poets\u2019 hearts, Nirvana were singular. Yet their slower songs have become unjustly obscured as the decades have rolled by. Has Kurt Cobain even more movingly articulated his angst and his anger than on the best song from their swan-song album, 1993\u2019s In Utero? All Apologies \u2013 a mea culpa howled from the precipice \u2013 was directed to his wife, Courtney Love, and their baby daughter, Frances Bean. Six months later, Cobain would take his own life. No other composition more movingly articulates the despair that was set to devour him whole and the chest bursting love he felt for his family. Its circumstances are tragic yet its message \u2013 that loves lingers after we have gone \u2013 is uplifting. EP Rex 2/40 Nine Inch Nails \u2013 \"Hurt\" \u201cAnd you could have it all / My empire of dirt / I will let you down / I will make you hurt.\u201d Trent Reznor\u2019s lacerating diagnosis of his addiction to self-destruction \u2013 he has never confirmed whether or not the song refers to heroin use \u2013 would have an unlikely rebirth via Johnny Cash\u2019s 2002 cover. But all of that ache, torrid lyricism and terrible beauty is already present and correct in Reznor\u2019s original. EP Getty 3/40 Joy Division \u2013 \u201cLove Will Tear Us Apart\u201d \u201cWhy is the bedroom so cold turned away on your side? / Is my timing that flawed, our respect run so dry?\u201d Basking in its semi-official status as student disco anthem Joy Division\u2019s biggest hit has arguably suffered from over-familiarity. Yet approached with fresh ears the aching humanity of Ian Curtis\u2019s words glimmer darkly. His marriage was falling apart when he wrote the lyrics and he would take his own life shortly afterwards. But far from a ghoulish dispatch from the brink \u201cLove Will Tear Us Apart\u201d unfurls like a jangling guitar sonnet \u2013 sad and searing. EP Paul Slattery/Retna 4/40 Arcade Fire \u2013 \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\" \u201cThey heard me singing and they told me to stop / Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock.\u201d Locating the dreamy underside of suburban ennui was perhaps the crowning achievement of Arcade Fire and their finest album, The Suburbs. Many artists have tried to speak to the asphyxiating conformity of life amid the manicured lawns and two-cars-in-the-drive purgatory of life in the sticks. But Arcade Fire articulated the frustrations and sense of something better just over the horizon that will be instantly familiar to anyone who grew up far away from the bright lights, \u201cSprawl II\u201d\u2019s keening synths gorgeous counterpointed by R\u00e9gine Chassagne who sings like Bjork if Bjork stocked shelves in a supermarket while studying for her degree by night. EP AFP/Getty Images 5/40 Beyonce \u2013 \"Formation\" \"I like my baby hair, with baby hair and afros / I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils / Earned all this money but they'll never take the country out me / I got hot sauce in my bag, swag.\" Beyonce had made politically charged statements before this, but \u201cFormation\u201d felt like her most explicit. The lyrics reclaim the power in her identity as a black woman from the deep south and have her bragging about her wealth and refusing to forget her roots. In a society that still judges women for boasting about their success, Beyonce owns it, and makes a point of asserting her power, including over men. \u201cYou might just be a black Bill Gates in the making,\u201d she muses, but then decides, actually: \u201cI might just be a black Bill Gates in the making.\u201d RO (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for Coachella) 6/40 Laura Marling \u2013 \u201cGhosts\u201d \u201cLover, please do not / Fall to your knees / It\u2019s not Like I believe in / Everlasting love.\u201d Haunted folkie Marling was 16 when she wrote her break-out ballad \u2013 a divination of teenage heartache with a streak of flinty maturity that punches the listener in the gut. It\u2019s one of the most coruscating anti-love songs of recent history \u2013 and a reminder that, Mumford and Sons notwithstanding \u2013 the mid 2000s nu-folk scene wasn\u2019t quite the hellish fandango posterity has deemed it. EP Alan McAteer 7/40 LCD Soundsystem \u2013 \"Losing My Edge\" \u201cI\u2019m losing my edge / To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin / I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered Eighties.\u201d One of the best songs ever written about ageing and being forced to make peace with the person you are becoming. Long before the concept of the \u201chipster\u201d had gone mainstream, the 30-something James Murphy was lamenting the cool kids \u2013 with their beards and their trucker hats \u2013 snapping at his heels. Coming out of his experiences as a too-cool-for school DJ in New York, the song functions perfectly well as a satire of Nathan Barley-type trendies. But, as Murphy desperately reels off all his cutting-edge influences, it\u2019s the seam of genuine pain running through the lyrics that give it its universality. EP Getty Images 8/40 Leonard Cohen \u2013 \"So Long, Marianne\" \u201cWell you know that I love to live with you/ but you make me forget so very much / I forget to pray for the angels / and then the angels forget to pray for us.\u201d You could fill an entire ledger with unforgettable Cohen lyrics \u2013 couplets that cut you in half like a samurai blade so that you don\u2019t even notice what\u2019s happened until you suddenly slide into pieces. \u201cSo Long, Marianne\u201d was devoted to his lover, Marianne Jensen, whom he met on the Greek Island of Hydra in 1960. As the lyrics attest, they ultimately passed like ships in a long, sad night. She died three months before Cohen, in July 2016. Shortly beforehand he wrote to her his final farewell \u2013 a coda to the ballad that had come to define her in the wider world. \u201cKnow that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine... Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road.\u201d EP Getty 9/40 The Libertines \u2013 \"Can't Stand Me Now\" \"An end fitting for the start / you twist and tore our love apart.\" The great pop bromance of our times came crashing down shortly after Carl Bar\u00e2t and Pete Doherty slung their arms around each others shoulders and delivered this incredible platonic love song. Has a break-up dirge ever stung so bitterly as when the Libertines duo counted the ways in which each had betrayed the other? Shortly afterwards, Doherty\u2019s spiralling chemical habit would see him booted out of the group and he would become a national mascot for druggy excess \u2013 a sort of Danny Dyer with track-marks along his arm. But he and Bar\u00e2t \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 would always have \u201cCan\u2019t Stand Me Now\u201d, a laundry list of petty betrayals that gets you right in the chest. EP Rex Features 10/40 Kate Bush \u2013 \"Cloudbusting\" \"You're like my yo-yo/ That glowed in the dark/ What made it special/ Made it dangerous/ So I bury it/ And forget.\" Few artists use surrealism as successfully as Kate Bush \u2013 or draw inspiration from such unusual places. So you have \u201cCloudbusting\u201d, about the relationship between psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich and his son, Peter, the latter of whom Bush inhabits with disarming tenderness. The way Peter\u2019s father is compared to such a vivid childhood memory is a perfect, haunting testimony to the ways we are affected by loss as adults. RO Rex 11/40 Nick Cave \u2013 \"Into my Arms\" \u201cI don't believe in an interventionist God / But I know, darling, that you do / But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him / Not to intervene when it came to you.\" True, the lyrics spew and coo and, written down, resemble something Robbie Williams might croon on his way back from the tattoo parlour (\u201cAnd I don't believe in the existence of angels /But looking at you I wonder if that's true\u201d). Yet they are delivered with a straight-from-the-pulpit ferocity from Cave as he lays out his feelings for a significant other (opinions are divided whether it is directed to the mother of his eldest son Luke, Viviane Carneiro, or to PJ Harvey, with whom he was briefly involved). He\u2019s gushing all right, but like lava from a volcano, about to burn all before it. EP Getty 12/40 Sisters of Mercy \u2013 \"This Corrosion\" \u201cOn days like this/ In times like these/I feel an animal deep inside/ Heel to haunch on bended knees.\u201d Andrew Eldritch is the great forgotten lyricist of his generation. Dominion/Mother Russia was a rumination on the apocalypse and also a critique of efforts to meaningfully engage with the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. Ever better, and from the same Floodlands album was \u201cThis Corrosion\u201d \u2013 a track more epic than watching all three Lord the Rings movies from the top of Mount Everest. Amid the choirs and the primordial guitars, what gives the nine-minute belter its real power are the lyrics \u2013 which may (or may not) allude to the not-at-all amicable departure from the Sisters of Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams. Either way, Eldritch paints forceful pictures in the listener\u2019s head, especially during the stream of consciousness outro, unspooling like an excerpt from HP Lovecraft\u2019s The Necronomicon or the Book of Revelations: The Musical. EP Rex 13/40 Sultans of Ping FC \u2013 \"Where's Me Jumper?\" \u201cIt's alright to say things can only get better/ You haven't lost your brand new sweater/ Pure new wool, and perfect stitches/ Not the type of jumper that makes you itches.\u201d Received as a novelty ditty on its debut in \u2013 pauses to feel old \u2013 January 1992, the Sultans\u2019 lament for a missing item of woollen-wear has, with time, been revealed as something deeper. It\u2019s obviously playful and parodying of angst-filled indie lyrics (of which there was no shortage in the shoe-gazy early Nineties). But there\u2019s a howl of pain woven deep into the song\u2019s fabric, so that the larking is underpinned with a lingering unease. EP Flickr/Ian Oliver 14/40 The Smiths \u2013 \"There is a Light that Never Goes Out\" \u201cTake me out tonight/Take me anywhere, I don't care/I don't care, I don't care.\u201d As with Leonard Cohen, you could spend the rest of your days debating the greatest Morrissey lyrics. But surely there has never been a more perfect collection of couplets than that contained in their 1982 opus. It\u2019s hysterically witty, with the narrator painting death by ten-ton truck as the last word in romantic demises. But the trademark Moz sardonic wit is elsewhere eclipsed by a blinding light of spiritual torment, resulting in a song that functions both as cosmic joke and howl into the abyss. EP Rex 15/40 Bruce Springsteen \u2013 \"I'm on Fire\" \u201cAt night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet/ And a freight train running through the/ Middle of my head /Only you can cool my desire.\u201d Written down, Springsteen lyrics can \u2013 stops to ensure reinforced steel helmet is strapped on \u2013 read like a fever-dream Bud Light commercial. It\u2019s the delivery, husky, hokey, all-believing that brings them to life. And he has never written more perfectly couched verse than this tone-poem about forbidden desire from 1984\u2019s Born in the USA. Springsteen was at that time engaged to actress/model Julianne Phillips though he had already experienced a connection to his future wife Patti Scialfa, recently joined the E-Street Band as a backing singer. Thus the portents of the song do not require deep scrutiny, as lust and yearning are blended into one of the most combustible cocktails in mainstream rock. EP (Photo by Brian Ach/Getty Images for Bob Woodruff Foundation) 16/40 Tori Amos \u2013 \"Father Lucifer\" \u201cHe says he reckons I'm a watercolour stain/ He says I run and then I run from him and then I run/ He didn't see me watching from the aeroplane/ He wiped a tear and then he threw away our apple seed.\u201d The daughter of a strict baptist preacher, Amos constantly wrote about her daddy issues. Father Lucifer was further inspired by visions she had received whilst taking peyote with a South American shaman. The result was a feverish delving into familial angst, framed by a prism of nightmarish hallucination. It\u2019s about love, death, God and the dark things in our life we daren\u2019t confront \u2013 the rush of words delivered with riveting understatement. EP AFP/Getty 17/40 Public Enemy \u2013 \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\" \u201cI got a letter from the government/ The other day/I opened and read it/It said they were suckers/ They wanted me for their army or whatever/ Picture me given' a damn, I said never.\u201d Decades before Black Lives Matter, Chuck D and Public Enemy were articulating the under siege reality of daily existence for millions of African-Americans. Black Steel, later covered by trip-hopper Tricky, is a pummelling refusal to be co-opted into American\u2019s Land of the Free mythology \u2013 a message arguably as pertinent today as when it kicked down the doors 30 years ago. EP Secret Garden Party 18/40 Kendrick Lamar \u2013\" Swimming Pool (Drank)\" \u201cFirst you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it/ Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it/ I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock\u201d. Lamar is widely acknowledged as one of contemporary hip-hop\u2019s greatest lyricists. He was never more searing than on this early confessional \u2013 a rumination on his poverty-wracked childhood and the addictions that ripped like wildfire through his extended family in Compton and Chicago. There is also an early warning about the destructive temptations of fame as the young Kendrick is invited to join hip hop\u2019s tradition of riotous excess and lose himself in an acid bath of liquor and oblivion. EP Getty Images for NARAS 19/40 Prince \u2013 \"Sign O' the Times\" \u201cA skinny man died of a big disease with a little name/ By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same.\u201d Prince\u2019s lyrics had always felt like an extension of his dreamily pervy persona and, even as the African-American community bore the brunt of Reagan-era reactionary politics, Prince was living in his own world. He crashed back to earth with his 1987 masterpiece \u2013 and its title track, a stunning meditation on gang violence, Aids, political instability and natural disaster. EP Getty Images 20/40 Rolling Stones \u2013 \"Gimme Shelter\" \"War, children, it's just a shot away/ It's just a shot away.\" Nobody captured the violent tumult of the end of the Sixties better than Mick, Keith and co. Their one masterpiece to rule them all was, of course, \u201cGimme Shelter\u201d. Today, the credit for its uncanny power largely goes to Merry Clayton\u2019s gale-force backing vocals. But the Satanic majesty also flows from the lyrics \u2013 which spoke to the pandemonium of the era and the sense that civilisation could come crashing in at any moment. EP Redferns 21/40 David Bowie \u2013 \"Station to Station\" \u201cOnce there were mountains on mountains/ And once there were sun birds to soar with/ And once I could never be down/Got to keep searching and searching.\u201d Which Bowie lyrics to single out? The gordian mystery of Bewlay Brothers? The meta horror movie of Ashes to Ashes? The uncanny last will and testament that was the entirety of Blackstar \u2013 a ticking clock of a record that shape-shifted into something else entirely when Bowie passed away three days after its release? You could stay up all night arguing so let\u2019s just pick on one of the greats \u2013 the trans-Continental odyssey comprising the title track to Station to Station. Recorded, goes the myth, in the darkest days of Bowie\u2019s LA drug phase, the track is a magisterial eulogy for the Europe he had abandoned and which he would soon return to for his Berlin period. All of that and Bowie makes the line \u201cit\u2019s not the side effects of the cocaine\u2026\u201d feel like a proclamation of ancient wisdom. EP Express/Getty 22/40 Oasis \u2013 \"Supersonic\" \u201cShe done it with a doctor on a helicopter/ She's sniffin in her tissue/ Sellin' the Big Issue.\u201d There is shameless revisionism and then there is claiming that Noel Gallagher is a great lyricist. And yet, it\u2019s the sheer, triumphant dunder-headedness of Oasis\u2019 biggest hits that makes them so enjoyable. Rhyming \u201cElsa\u201d with \u201cAlka Seltzer\u201d, as Noel does on this Morning Glory smash, is a gesture of towering vapidity \u2013 but there\u2019s a genius in its lack of sophistication. Blur waxing clever, winking at Martin Amis etc, could never hold a candle to Oasis being gleefully boneheaded. EP Rex 23/40 Underworld \u2013 \"Born Slippy\" \u201cYou had chemicals boy/ I've grown so close to you/ Boy and you just groan boy.\u201d The ironic \u201clager, lager, lager\u201d chant somehow became one the most bittersweet moments in Nineties pop. Underworld never wanted to be stars and actively campaigned against the release of their contribution to the Trainspotting score as a single. Yet there is no denying the glorious ache of this bittersweet groover \u2013 or the punch of Karl Hyde\u2019s sad raver stream-of-consciousness wordplay. It\u2019s that rare dance track which reveals hidden depths when you sit down with the lyrics. EP Getty 24/40 Fleetwood Mac \u2013 \"Landslide\" \"And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills/ Till the landslide brought me down\" Stevie Nicks was only 27 when she wrote one of the most poignant and astute meditations on how people change with time, and the fear of having to give up everything you\u2019ve worked for. RO Getty Images 25/40 Paul Simon \u2013 \"Graceland\" \u201cShe comes back to tell me she's gone/ As if I didn't know that/ As if I didn't know my own bed.\u201d With contributions from Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Boyoyo Boys, Simon\u2019s 1986 masterpiece album is regarded nowadays as a landmark interweaving of world music and pop. But it was also a break-up record mourning the end of his marriage of 11 months to Carrie Fisher. The pain of the separation is laid out nakedly on the title track, where he unflinchingly chronicles the dissolution of the relationship. EP Getty 26/40 Lou Reed \u2013 \"Walk on the Wild Side\" \"Candy came from out on the island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darling/ But she never lost her head/ Even when she was giving head/ She says, hey baby, take a walk on the wild side.\" Reed\u2019s most famous song paid tribute to all the colourful characters he knew in New York City. Released three years after the Stonewall Riots, \u201cWalk on the Wild Side\u201d embraced and celebrated the \u201cother\u201d in simple, affectionate terms. The Seventies represented a huge shift in visibility for LGBT+ people, and with this track, Reed asserted himself as a proud ally. RO AFP/Getty Images 27/40 Sharon Van Etten \u2013 \"Every Time the Sun Comes Up\" \u201cPeople say I'm a one-hit wonder/ But what happens when I have two?/ I washed your dishes, but I shit in your bathroom.\u201d The breakdown of a 10 year relationship informed some of the hardest hitting songs on the New Jersey songwriter\u2019s fourth album. Are We There. She takes no prisoner on the closing track \u2013 a tale of domesticity rent asunder that lands its punches precisely because of Van Etten\u2019s eye for a mundane, even grubby, detail. EP Ryan Pfluger 28/40 Patti Smith \u2013 \u201cGloria\u201d \u201cJesus died for somebody's sins but not mine/ Meltin\u2019 in a pot of thieves/ Wild card up my sleeve/ Thick heart of stone/ My sins my own/ They belong to me\u201d The song that launched a thousand punk bands. It takes three minutes to get to Van Morrison\u2019s chorus on Patti Smith\u2019s overhaul of \u201cGloria\u201d, where she lusts after a girl she spots through the window at a party. Before that, there is poetry. She snarls and shrieks as though her vocal chords might rip. The ostentatiousness of the lyrics owes as much to poets Arthur Rimbaud and Baudelaire as it does to Jim Morrison. RO Samir Hussein/Redferns 29/40 The Eagles \u2013 \"Hotel California\" \u201cThere she stood in the doorway/ I heard the mission bell/ And I was thinking to myself/ This could be Heaven or this could be Hell.\u201d A cry of existential despair from the great soft-rock goliath of the Seventies. By the tail-end of the decade the Eagles were thoroughly fed up of one another and jaundiced by fame. The titular \u2013 and fictional \u2013 Hotel California is a metaphor for life in a successful rock band: \u201cYou can check-out any time you like / But you can never leave.\u201d The hallucinatory imagery was meanwhile inspired by a late night drive through LA, the streets empty, an eerie hush holding sway. EP Rick Diamond/Getty Images 30/40 Thin Lizzy \u2013 \"The Boys are Back in Town\" \u201cGuess who just got back today/ Them wild-eyed boys that had been away/ Haven't changed that much to say/But man, I still think them cats are crazy.\u201d A strut of swaggering confidence captured in musical form \u2013 and a celebration of going back to your roots and reconnecting with the people who matter. Thin Lizzy\u2019s biggest hit was in part inspired by Phil Lynott\u2019s childhood memories of a Manchester criminal gang. The gang members were constantly in and out of prison and the song imagines one of their reunions \u2013 even name-checking their favourite hangout of Dino\u2019s Bar and Grill where \u201cthe drink will flow and the blood will spill\u201d. EP REX 31/40 Nina Simone \u2013 \"Four Women\" \"I\u2019ll kill the first mother I see/ My life has been too rough/ I\u2019m awfully bitter these days/ Because my parents were slaves.\" Included on her 1966 album Wild is the Wind, Simone depicts four characters \u2013 Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches \u2013 who represent different parts of the lasting legacy of slavery. Some critics accused her of racial stereotyping, but for Simone, it was these women\u2019s freedom to define themselves that gave them their power. RO Getty 32/40 St Vincent \u2013 \"Digital Witness\" \u201cDigital witnesses/ what\u2019s the point of even sleeping?/ If I can\u2019t show it, if you can\u2019t see me/ What\u2019s the point of doing anything?\u201d One of the best songs written about the illusory intimacy fostered the internet. St Vincent \u2013 aka Texas songwriter Annie Clark \u2013 was singing about how social media fed our narcissism and gave us a fake sense of our place in the world. EP Anthony Harvey/Getty Images 33/40 Frank Ocean \u2013 \"Pink + White\" \"Up for air from the swimming pool/ You kneel down to the dry land/ Kiss the Earth that birthed you Gave you tools just to stay alive/ And make it up when the sun is ruined.\" Co-written with Pharrell and Tyler, the Creator, \u201cPink + White\u201d stands out even on an album like Frank Ocean\u2019s Blonde. He sings \u2013 with a gently swaying, almost resigned delivery \u2013 surrealist lyrics that likens a past relationship to a brief high, from the perspective of the comedown that follows. RO Getty Images 34/40 Rufus Wainwright \u2013 \"Dinner at Eight\" \u201cIf I want to see the tears in your eyes/ Then I know it had to be/ Long ago, actually in the drifting white snow/You loved me.\u201d Piano-man Wainwright can be too ornate for his own good. But how he lands his blows here in this soul-baring recounting of a violent disagreement with his father. Loudon III, a cult folkie in his own right walked out on the family when Rufus was a child and the simmering resentments had lingered on. They boiled over at a joint Rolling Stone photoshoot during which Rufus had joked that his dad needed him to get into Rolling Stone and his father had not taken the insult lying down. The dispute is here restaged by Wainwright the younger as a raging row at the dinner table. EP Getty 35/40 Bob Dylan \u2013 \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" \"Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn/ Suicide remarks are torn/ From the fool's gold mouthpiece/ The hollow horn plays wasted words/ Proves to warn that he not busy being born/ Is busy dying.\" \u201cIt\u2019s Alright Ma\u201d is a cornerstone in Dylan\u2019s career that marks his shift from scrutinising politics to sardonically exposing all the hypocrisy in Western culture. He references the Book of Ecclesiastes but also Elvis Presley, and offers up the grim perspective of a man whose views do not fit in with the world around him. RO (Photo by Express Newspapers/Getty Images) 36/40 ABBA \u2013 \"The Winner Takes it All\" \u201cI don't wanna talk/ About the things we've gone through/ Though it's hurting me/ Now it's history.\u201d The first and last word in break-up ballads. The consensus is that it was written by Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus about his divorce from band-mate Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog, though he has always denied this, saying \u201cis the experience of a divorce, but it's fiction\u201d. Whether or not he protests too much the impact is searing as F\u00e4ltskog wrenchingly chronicles a separation from the perspective of the other party. EP AFP/Getty Images 37/40 Nas \u2013 \"The World is Yours\" \"I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul/ The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child/ Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled/ Or caught by the devil's lasso, s*** is a hassle\" Nas addresses both himself and his future progeny on one of the best tracks from his faultless debut Illmatic. Inspired by the scene from Scarface in which Tony Montana sees a blimp with the message \u201cThe World is Yours\u201d during a visit to the movie theatre, it feeds back to the rapper\u2019s own belief that certain signs will appear to convince you that you\u2019re on the right track. RO 38/40 The Stone Roses \u2013 \"I Wanna Be Adored\" \u201cI don\u2019t have to sell my soul/ He\u2019s already in me/ I don\u2019t need to sell my soul/ He\u2019s already in me.\u201d A statement of intent, a zen riddle, a perfect accompaniment to one of the greatest riffs in indie-dom - the opening track of the Stone Roses\u2019s 1989 debut album was all of this and much more. The lyrics are supremely economical \u2013 just the chorus repeated over and over, really. But these are nonetheless amongst the most hypnotic lines in pop. Adding poignancy is the rumour that the Roses wrote it as an apology to early fans reportedly aghast that the group had signed a big fat record deal. EP Getty Images 39/40 The Beatles \u2013 \"When I'm Sixty Four\" \"When I get older losing my hair/ Many years from now/ Will you still be sending me a Valentine/ Birthday greetings bottle of wine?\" There are hundreds of great songs about epic, romantic love, and there are hundreds of other Beatles songs that could have made this list. But this track from Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band \u2013 written by a 16-year-old Paul McCartney \u2013 is one of the greats for how it encapsulates a kind of love that is less appreciated in musical form. It\u2019s less \u201cI\u2019d take a bullet for you\u201d and more \u201cput the kettle on, love\u201d. It\u2019s adorable, full of whimsy, and just the right amount of silly. RO Getty 40/40 Beck \u2013 \"Loser\" \u201cIn the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey / Butane in my veins so I'm out to cut the junkie.\u201d \u201cMan I\u2019m the worst rapper in the world \u2013 I\u2019m a loser,\u201d Beck is reported to have said upon listening back to an early demo of his break-out hit (before it had acquired its iconic chorus) . This gave him an idea for the hook and he never looked back. The stream of consciousness lyrics cast a spell even though they don\u2019t make much sense \u2013 ironic as Beck was setting out the emulate the hyper-literate Chuck D. EP 1/40 Nirvana \u2013 \"All Apologies\" \u201cI wish I was like you / Easily amused / Find my nest of salt / Everything's my fault.\u201d As headbangers with bleeding poets\u2019 hearts, Nirvana were singular. Yet their slower songs have become unjustly obscured as the decades have rolled by. Has Kurt Cobain even more movingly articulated his angst and his anger than on the best song from their swan-song album, 1993\u2019s In Utero? All Apologies \u2013 a mea culpa howled from the precipice \u2013 was directed to his wife, Courtney Love, and their baby daughter, Frances Bean. Six months later, Cobain would take his own life. No other composition more movingly articulates the despair that was set to devour him whole and the chest bursting love he felt for his family. Its circumstances are tragic yet its message \u2013 that loves lingers after we have gone \u2013 is uplifting. EP Rex 2/40 Nine Inch Nails \u2013 \"Hurt\" \u201cAnd you could have it all / My empire of dirt / I will let you down / I will make you hurt.\u201d Trent Reznor\u2019s lacerating diagnosis of his addiction to self-destruction \u2013 he has never confirmed whether or not the song refers to heroin use \u2013 would have an unlikely rebirth via Johnny Cash\u2019s 2002 cover. But all of that ache, torrid lyricism and terrible beauty is already present and correct in Reznor\u2019s original. EP Getty 3/40 Joy Division \u2013 \u201cLove Will Tear Us Apart\u201d \u201cWhy is the bedroom so cold turned away on your side? / Is my timing that flawed, our respect run so dry?\u201d Basking in its semi-official status as student disco anthem Joy Division\u2019s biggest hit has arguably suffered from over-familiarity. Yet approached with fresh ears the aching humanity of Ian Curtis\u2019s words glimmer darkly. His marriage was falling apart when he wrote the lyrics and he would take his own life shortly afterwards. But far from a ghoulish dispatch from the brink \u201cLove Will Tear Us Apart\u201d unfurls like a jangling guitar sonnet \u2013 sad and searing. EP Paul Slattery/Retna 4/40 Arcade Fire \u2013 \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\" \u201cThey heard me singing and they told me to stop / Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock.\u201d Locating the dreamy underside of suburban ennui was perhaps the crowning achievement of Arcade Fire and their finest album, The Suburbs. Many artists have tried to speak to the asphyxiating conformity of life amid the manicured lawns and two-cars-in-the-drive purgatory of life in the sticks. But Arcade Fire articulated the frustrations and sense of something better just over the horizon that will be instantly familiar to anyone who grew up far away from the bright lights, \u201cSprawl II\u201d\u2019s keening synths gorgeous counterpointed by R\u00e9gine Chassagne who sings like Bjork if Bjork stocked shelves in a supermarket while studying for her degree by night. EP AFP/Getty Images 5/40 Beyonce \u2013 \"Formation\" \"I like my baby hair, with baby hair and afros / I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils / Earned all this money but they'll never take the country out me / I got hot sauce in my bag, swag.\" Beyonce had made politically charged statements before this, but \u201cFormation\u201d felt like her most explicit. The lyrics reclaim the power in her identity as a black woman from the deep south and have her bragging about her wealth and refusing to forget her roots. In a society that still judges women for boasting about their success, Beyonce owns it, and makes a point of asserting her power, including over men. \u201cYou might just be a black Bill Gates in the making,\u201d she muses, but then decides, actually: \u201cI might just be a black Bill Gates in the making.\u201d RO (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for Coachella) 6/40 Laura Marling \u2013 \u201cGhosts\u201d \u201cLover, please do not / Fall to your knees / It\u2019s not Like I believe in / Everlasting love.\u201d Haunted folkie Marling was 16 when she wrote her break-out ballad \u2013 a divination of teenage heartache with a streak of flinty maturity that punches the listener in the gut. It\u2019s one of the most coruscating anti-love songs of recent history \u2013 and a reminder that, Mumford and Sons notwithstanding \u2013 the mid 2000s nu-folk scene wasn\u2019t quite the hellish fandango posterity has deemed it. EP Alan McAteer 7/40 LCD Soundsystem \u2013 \"Losing My Edge\" \u201cI\u2019m losing my edge / To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin / I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered Eighties.\u201d One of the best songs ever written about ageing and being forced to make peace with the person you are becoming. Long before the concept of the \u201chipster\u201d had gone mainstream, the 30-something James Murphy was lamenting the cool kids \u2013 with their beards and their trucker hats \u2013 snapping at his heels. Coming out of his experiences as a too-cool-for school DJ in New York, the song functions perfectly well as a satire of Nathan Barley-type trendies. But, as Murphy desperately reels off all his cutting-edge influences, it\u2019s the seam of genuine pain running through the lyrics that give it its universality. EP Getty Images 8/40 Leonard Cohen \u2013 \"So Long, Marianne\" \u201cWell you know that I love to live with you/ but you make me forget so very much / I forget to pray for the angels / and then the angels forget to pray for us.\u201d You could fill an entire ledger with unforgettable Cohen lyrics \u2013 couplets that cut you in half like a samurai blade so that you don\u2019t even notice what\u2019s happened until you suddenly slide into pieces. \u201cSo Long, Marianne\u201d was devoted to his lover, Marianne Jensen, whom he met on the Greek Island of Hydra in 1960. As the lyrics attest, they ultimately passed like ships in a long, sad night. She died three months before Cohen, in July 2016. Shortly beforehand he wrote to her his final farewell \u2013 a coda to the ballad that had come to define her in the wider world. \u201cKnow that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine... Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road.\u201d EP Getty 9/40 The Libertines \u2013 \"Can't Stand Me Now\" \"An end fitting for the start / you twist and tore our love apart.\" The great pop bromance of our times came crashing down shortly after Carl Bar\u00e2t and Pete Doherty slung their arms around each others shoulders and delivered this incredible platonic love song. Has a break-up dirge ever stung so bitterly as when the Libertines duo counted the ways in which each had betrayed the other? Shortly afterwards, Doherty\u2019s spiralling chemical habit would see him booted out of the group and he would become a national mascot for druggy excess \u2013 a sort of Danny Dyer with track-marks along his arm. But he and Bar\u00e2t \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 would always have \u201cCan\u2019t Stand Me Now\u201d, a laundry list of petty betrayals that gets you right in the chest. EP Rex Features 10/40 Kate Bush \u2013 \"Cloudbusting\" \"You're like my yo-yo/ That glowed in the dark/ What made it special/ Made it dangerous/ So I bury it/ And forget.\" Few artists use surrealism as successfully as Kate Bush \u2013 or draw inspiration from such unusual places. So you have \u201cCloudbusting\u201d, about the relationship between psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich and his son, Peter, the latter of whom Bush inhabits with disarming tenderness. The way Peter\u2019s father is compared to such a vivid childhood memory is a perfect, haunting testimony to the ways we are affected by loss as adults. RO Rex 11/40 Nick Cave \u2013 \"Into my Arms\" \u201cI don't believe in an interventionist God / But I know, darling, that you do / But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him / Not to intervene when it came to you.\" True, the lyrics spew and coo and, written down, resemble something Robbie Williams might croon on his way back from the tattoo parlour (\u201cAnd I don't believe in the existence of angels /But looking at you I wonder if that's true\u201d). Yet they are delivered with a straight-from-the-pulpit ferocity from Cave as he lays out his feelings for a significant other (opinions are divided whether it is directed to the mother of his eldest son Luke, Viviane Carneiro, or to PJ Harvey, with whom he was briefly involved). He\u2019s gushing all right, but like lava from a volcano, about to burn all before it. EP Getty 12/40 Sisters of Mercy \u2013 \"This Corrosion\" \u201cOn days like this/ In times like these/I feel an animal deep inside/ Heel to haunch on bended knees.\u201d Andrew Eldritch is the great forgotten lyricist of his generation. Dominion/Mother Russia was a rumination on the apocalypse and also a critique of efforts to meaningfully engage with the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. Ever better, and from the same Floodlands album was \u201cThis Corrosion\u201d \u2013 a track more epic than watching all three Lord the Rings movies from the top of Mount Everest. Amid the choirs and the primordial guitars, what gives the nine-minute belter its real power are the lyrics \u2013 which may (or may not) allude to the not-at-all amicable departure from the Sisters of Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams. Either way, Eldritch paints forceful pictures in the listener\u2019s head, especially during the stream of consciousness outro, unspooling like an excerpt from HP Lovecraft\u2019s The Necronomicon or the Book of Revelations: The Musical. EP Rex 13/40 Sultans of Ping FC \u2013 \"Where's Me Jumper?\" \u201cIt's alright to say things can only get better/ You haven't lost your brand new sweater/ Pure new wool, and perfect stitches/ Not the type of jumper that makes you itches.\u201d Received as a novelty ditty on its debut in \u2013 pauses to feel old \u2013 January 1992, the Sultans\u2019 lament for a missing item of woollen-wear has, with time, been revealed as something deeper. It\u2019s obviously playful and parodying of angst-filled indie lyrics (of which there was no shortage in the shoe-gazy early Nineties). But there\u2019s a howl of pain woven deep into the song\u2019s fabric, so that the larking is underpinned with a lingering unease. EP Flickr/Ian Oliver 14/40 The Smiths \u2013 \"There is a Light that Never Goes Out\" \u201cTake me out tonight/Take me anywhere, I don't care/I don't care, I don't care.\u201d As with Leonard Cohen, you could spend the rest of your days debating the greatest Morrissey lyrics. But surely there has never been a more perfect collection of couplets than that contained in their 1982 opus. It\u2019s hysterically witty, with the narrator painting death by ten-ton truck as the last word in romantic demises. But the trademark Moz sardonic wit is elsewhere eclipsed by a blinding light of spiritual torment, resulting in a song that functions both as cosmic joke and howl into the abyss. EP Rex 15/40 Bruce Springsteen \u2013 \"I'm on Fire\" \u201cAt night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet/ And a freight train running through the/ Middle of my head /Only you can cool my desire.\u201d Written down, Springsteen lyrics can \u2013 stops to ensure reinforced steel helmet is strapped on \u2013 read like a fever-dream Bud Light commercial. It\u2019s the delivery, husky, hokey, all-believing that brings them to life. And he has never written more perfectly couched verse than this tone-poem about forbidden desire from 1984\u2019s Born in the USA. Springsteen was at that time engaged to actress/model Julianne Phillips though he had already experienced a connection to his future wife Patti Scialfa, recently joined the E-Street Band as a backing singer. Thus the portents of the song do not require deep scrutiny, as lust and yearning are blended into one of the most combustible cocktails in mainstream rock. EP (Photo by Brian Ach/Getty Images for Bob Woodruff Foundation) 16/40 Tori Amos \u2013 \"Father Lucifer\" \u201cHe says he reckons I'm a watercolour stain/ He says I run and then I run from him and then I run/ He didn't see me watching from the aeroplane/ He wiped a tear and then he threw away our apple seed.\u201d The daughter of a strict baptist preacher, Amos constantly wrote about her daddy issues. Father Lucifer was further inspired by visions she had received whilst taking peyote with a South American shaman. The result was a feverish delving into familial angst, framed by a prism of nightmarish hallucination. It\u2019s about love, death, God and the dark things in our life we daren\u2019t confront \u2013 the rush of words delivered with riveting understatement. EP AFP/Getty 17/40 Public Enemy \u2013 \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\" \u201cI got a letter from the government/ The other day/I opened and read it/It said they were suckers/ They wanted me for their army or whatever/ Picture me given' a damn, I said never.\u201d Decades before Black Lives Matter, Chuck D and Public Enemy were articulating the under siege reality of daily existence for millions of African-Americans. Black Steel, later covered by trip-hopper Tricky, is a pummelling refusal to be co-opted into American\u2019s Land of the Free mythology \u2013 a message arguably as pertinent today as when it kicked down the doors 30 years ago. EP Secret Garden Party 18/40 Kendrick Lamar \u2013\" Swimming Pool (Drank)\" \u201cFirst you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it/ Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it/ I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock\u201d. Lamar is widely acknowledged as one of contemporary hip-hop\u2019s greatest lyricists. He was never more searing than on this early confessional \u2013 a rumination on his poverty-wracked childhood and the addictions that ripped like wildfire through his extended family in Compton and Chicago. There is also an early warning about the destructive temptations of fame as the young Kendrick is invited to join hip hop\u2019s tradition of riotous excess and lose himself in an acid bath of liquor and oblivion. EP Getty Images for NARAS 19/40 Prince \u2013 \"Sign O' the Times\" \u201cA skinny man died of a big disease with a little name/ By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same.\u201d Prince\u2019s lyrics had always felt like an extension of his dreamily pervy persona and, even as the African-American community bore the brunt of Reagan-era reactionary politics, Prince was living in his own world. He crashed back to earth with his 1987 masterpiece \u2013 and its title track, a stunning meditation on gang violence, Aids, political instability and natural disaster. EP Getty Images 20/40 Rolling Stones \u2013 \"Gimme Shelter\" \"War, children, it's just a shot away/ It's just a shot away.\" Nobody captured the violent tumult of the end of the Sixties better than Mick, Keith and co. Their one masterpiece to rule them all was, of course, \u201cGimme Shelter\u201d. Today, the credit for its uncanny power largely goes to Merry Clayton\u2019s gale-force backing vocals. But the Satanic majesty also flows from the lyrics \u2013 which spoke to the pandemonium of the era and the sense that civilisation could come crashing in at any moment. EP Redferns 21/40 David Bowie \u2013 \"Station to Station\" \u201cOnce there were mountains on mountains/ And once there were sun birds to soar with/ And once I could never be down/Got to keep searching and searching.\u201d Which Bowie lyrics to single out? The gordian mystery of Bewlay Brothers? The meta horror movie of Ashes to Ashes? The uncanny last will and testament that was the entirety of Blackstar \u2013 a ticking clock of a record that shape-shifted into something else entirely when Bowie passed away three days after its release? You could stay up all night arguing so let\u2019s just pick on one of the greats \u2013 the trans-Continental odyssey comprising the title track to Station to Station. Recorded, goes the myth, in the darkest days of Bowie\u2019s LA drug phase, the track is a magisterial eulogy for the Europe he had abandoned and which he would soon return to for his Berlin period. All of that and Bowie makes the line \u201cit\u2019s not the side effects of the cocaine\u2026\u201d feel like a proclamation of ancient wisdom. EP Express/Getty 22/40 Oasis \u2013 \"Supersonic\" \u201cShe done it with a doctor on a helicopter/ She's sniffin in her tissue/ Sellin' the Big Issue.\u201d There is shameless revisionism and then there is claiming that Noel Gallagher is a great lyricist. And yet, it\u2019s the sheer, triumphant dunder-headedness of Oasis\u2019 biggest hits that makes them so enjoyable. Rhyming \u201cElsa\u201d with \u201cAlka Seltzer\u201d, as Noel does on this Morning Glory smash, is a gesture of towering vapidity \u2013 but there\u2019s a genius in its lack of sophistication. Blur waxing clever, winking at Martin Amis etc, could never hold a candle to Oasis being gleefully boneheaded. EP Rex 23/40 Underworld \u2013 \"Born Slippy\" \u201cYou had chemicals boy/ I've grown so close to you/ Boy and you just groan boy.\u201d The ironic \u201clager, lager, lager\u201d chant somehow became one the most bittersweet moments in Nineties pop. Underworld never wanted to be stars and actively campaigned against the release of their contribution to the Trainspotting score as a single. Yet there is no denying the glorious ache of this bittersweet groover \u2013 or the punch of Karl Hyde\u2019s sad raver stream-of-consciousness wordplay. It\u2019s that rare dance track which reveals hidden depths when you sit down with the lyrics. EP Getty 24/40 Fleetwood Mac \u2013 \"Landslide\" \"And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills/ Till the landslide brought me down\" Stevie Nicks was only 27 when she wrote one of the most poignant and astute meditations on how people change with time, and the fear of having to give up everything you\u2019ve worked for. RO Getty Images 25/40 Paul Simon \u2013 \"Graceland\" \u201cShe comes back to tell me she's gone/ As if I didn't know that/ As if I didn't know my own bed.\u201d With contributions from Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Boyoyo Boys, Simon\u2019s 1986 masterpiece album is regarded nowadays as a landmark interweaving of world music and pop. But it was also a break-up record mourning the end of his marriage of 11 months to Carrie Fisher. The pain of the separation is laid out nakedly on the title track, where he unflinchingly chronicles the dissolution of the relationship. EP Getty 26/40 Lou Reed \u2013 \"Walk on the Wild Side\" \"Candy came from out on the island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darling/ But she never lost her head/ Even when she was giving head/ She says, hey baby, take a walk on the wild side.\" Reed\u2019s most famous song paid tribute to all the colourful characters he knew in New York City. Released three years after the Stonewall Riots, \u201cWalk on the Wild Side\u201d embraced and celebrated the \u201cother\u201d in simple, affectionate terms. The Seventies represented a huge shift in visibility for LGBT+ people, and with this track, Reed asserted himself as a proud ally. RO AFP/Getty Images 27/40 Sharon Van Etten \u2013 \"Every Time the Sun Comes Up\" \u201cPeople say I'm a one-hit wonder/ But what happens when I have two?/ I washed your dishes, but I shit in your bathroom.\u201d The breakdown of a 10 year relationship informed some of the hardest hitting songs on the New Jersey songwriter\u2019s fourth album. Are We There. She takes no prisoner on the closing track \u2013 a tale of domesticity rent asunder that lands its punches precisely because of Van Etten\u2019s eye for a mundane, even grubby, detail. EP Ryan Pfluger 28/40 Patti Smith \u2013 \u201cGloria\u201d \u201cJesus died for somebody's sins but not mine/ Meltin\u2019 in a pot of thieves/ Wild card up my sleeve/ Thick heart of stone/ My sins my own/ They belong to me\u201d The song that launched a thousand punk bands. It takes three minutes to get to Van Morrison\u2019s chorus on Patti Smith\u2019s overhaul of \u201cGloria\u201d, where she lusts after a girl she spots through the window at a party. Before that, there is poetry. She snarls and shrieks as though her vocal chords might rip. The ostentatiousness of the lyrics owes as much to poets Arthur Rimbaud and Baudelaire as it does to Jim Morrison. RO Samir Hussein/Redferns 29/40 The Eagles \u2013 \"Hotel California\" \u201cThere she stood in the doorway/ I heard the mission bell/ And I was thinking to myself/ This could be Heaven or this could be Hell.\u201d A cry of existential despair from the great soft-rock goliath of the Seventies. By the tail-end of the decade the Eagles were thoroughly fed up of one another and jaundiced by fame. The titular \u2013 and fictional \u2013 Hotel California is a metaphor for life in a successful rock band: \u201cYou can check-out any time you like / But you can never leave.\u201d The hallucinatory imagery was meanwhile inspired by a late night drive through LA, the streets empty, an eerie hush holding sway. EP Rick Diamond/Getty Images 30/40 Thin Lizzy \u2013 \"The Boys are Back in Town\" \u201cGuess who just got back today/ Them wild-eyed boys that had been away/ Haven't changed that much to say/But man, I still think them cats are crazy.\u201d A strut of swaggering confidence captured in musical form \u2013 and a celebration of going back to your roots and reconnecting with the people who matter. Thin Lizzy\u2019s biggest hit was in part inspired by Phil Lynott\u2019s childhood memories of a Manchester criminal gang. The gang members were constantly in and out of prison and the song imagines one of their reunions \u2013 even name-checking their favourite hangout of Dino\u2019s Bar and Grill where \u201cthe drink will flow and the blood will spill\u201d. EP REX 31/40 Nina Simone \u2013 \"Four Women\" \"I\u2019ll kill the first mother I see/ My life has been too rough/ I\u2019m awfully bitter these days/ Because my parents were slaves.\" Included on her 1966 album Wild is the Wind, Simone depicts four characters \u2013 Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches \u2013 who represent different parts of the lasting legacy of slavery. Some critics accused her of racial stereotyping, but for Simone, it was these women\u2019s freedom to define themselves that gave them their power. RO Getty 32/40 St Vincent \u2013 \"Digital Witness\" \u201cDigital witnesses/ what\u2019s the point of even sleeping?/ If I can\u2019t show it, if you can\u2019t see me/ What\u2019s the point of doing anything?\u201d One of the best songs written about the illusory intimacy fostered the internet. St Vincent \u2013 aka Texas songwriter Annie Clark \u2013 was singing about how social media fed our narcissism and gave us a fake sense of our place in the world. EP Anthony Harvey/Getty Images 33/40 Frank Ocean \u2013 \"Pink + White\" \"Up for air from the swimming pool/ You kneel down to the dry land/ Kiss the Earth that birthed you Gave you tools just to stay alive/ And make it up when the sun is ruined.\" Co-written with Pharrell and Tyler, the Creator, \u201cPink + White\u201d stands out even on an album like Frank Ocean\u2019s Blonde. He sings \u2013 with a gently swaying, almost resigned delivery \u2013 surrealist lyrics that likens a past relationship to a brief high, from the perspective of the comedown that follows. RO Getty Images 34/40 Rufus Wainwright \u2013 \"Dinner at Eight\" \u201cIf I want to see the tears in your eyes/ Then I know it had to be/ Long ago, actually in the drifting white snow/You loved me.\u201d Piano-man Wainwright can be too ornate for his own good. But how he lands his blows here in this soul-baring recounting of a violent disagreement with his father. Loudon III, a cult folkie in his own right walked out on the family when Rufus was a child and the simmering resentments had lingered on. They boiled over at a joint Rolling Stone photoshoot during which Rufus had joked that his dad needed him to get into Rolling Stone and his father had not taken the insult lying down. The dispute is here restaged by Wainwright the younger as a raging row at the dinner table. EP Getty 35/40 Bob Dylan \u2013 \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" \"Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn/ Suicide remarks are torn/ From the fool's gold mouthpiece/ The hollow horn plays wasted words/ Proves to warn that he not busy being born/ Is busy dying.\" \u201cIt\u2019s Alright Ma\u201d is a cornerstone in Dylan\u2019s career that marks his shift from scrutinising politics to sardonically exposing all the hypocrisy in Western culture. He references the Book of Ecclesiastes but also Elvis Presley, and offers up the grim perspective of a man whose views do not fit in with the world around him. RO (Photo by Express Newspapers/Getty Images) 36/40 ABBA \u2013 \"The Winner Takes it All\" \u201cI don't wanna talk/ About the things we've gone through/ Though it's hurting me/ Now it's history.\u201d The first and last word in break-up ballads. The consensus is that it was written by Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus about his divorce from band-mate Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog, though he has always denied this, saying \u201cis the experience of a divorce, but it's fiction\u201d. Whether or not he protests too much the impact is searing as F\u00e4ltskog wrenchingly chronicles a separation from the perspective of the other party. EP AFP/Getty Images 37/40 Nas \u2013 \"The World is Yours\" \"I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul/ The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child/ Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled/ Or caught by the devil's lasso, s*** is a hassle\" Nas addresses both himself and his future progeny on one of the best tracks from his faultless debut Illmatic. Inspired by the scene from Scarface in which Tony Montana sees a blimp with the message \u201cThe World is Yours\u201d during a visit to the movie theatre, it feeds back to the rapper\u2019s own belief that certain signs will appear to convince you that you\u2019re on the right track. RO 38/40 The Stone Roses \u2013 \"I Wanna Be Adored\" \u201cI don\u2019t have to sell my soul/ He\u2019s already in me/ I don\u2019t need to sell my soul/ He\u2019s already in me.\u201d A statement of intent, a zen riddle, a perfect accompaniment to one of the greatest riffs in indie-dom - the opening track of the Stone Roses\u2019s 1989 debut album was all of this and much more. The lyrics are supremely economical \u2013 just the chorus repeated over and over, really. But these are nonetheless amongst the most hypnotic lines in pop. Adding poignancy is the rumour that the Roses wrote it as an apology to early fans reportedly aghast that the group had signed a big fat record deal. EP Getty Images 39/40 The Beatles \u2013 \"When I'm Sixty Four\" \"When I get older losing my hair/ Many years from now/ Will you still be sending me a Valentine/ Birthday greetings bottle of wine?\" There are hundreds of great songs about epic, romantic love, and there are hundreds of other Beatles songs that could have made this list. But this track from Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band \u2013 written by a 16-year-old Paul McCartney \u2013 is one of the greats for how it encapsulates a kind of love that is less appreciated in musical form. It\u2019s less \u201cI\u2019d take a bullet for you\u201d and more \u201cput the kettle on, love\u201d. It\u2019s adorable, full of whimsy, and just the right amount of silly. RO Getty 40/40 Beck \u2013 \"Loser\" \u201cIn the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey / Butane in my veins so I'm out to cut the junkie.\u201d \u201cMan I\u2019m the worst rapper in the world \u2013 I\u2019m a loser,\u201d Beck is reported to have said upon listening back to an early demo of his break-out hit (before it had acquired its iconic chorus) . This gave him an idea for the hook and he never looked back. The stream of consciousness lyrics cast a spell even though they don\u2019t make much sense \u2013 ironic as Beck was setting out the emulate the hyper-literate Chuck D. EP\n\nShe was never encouraged or pressured into making such videos herself, and insists she had the right to refuse. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any pressure,\u201d she says. \u201cI think people wanna do it or they don\u2019t do it. People say they\u2019re pressured, but really the buck stops with the artist. If you don\u2019t want to do it say, \u2018I\u2019m not doin\u2019 it.\u2019 That\u2019s why you\u2019re in this position: because you\u2019re doing your own thing, and the executives aren\u2019t doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you watched the Harvey Weinstein documentary?\u201d Hynde asks idly. \u201cI had no intention of watching it but it popped up and I was interested.\u201d It attracted Hynde for various reasons, not least the fact that, with 18 months in age between the rock star and the film producer, their lives and careers have run somewhat in tandem. Social circles overlap. Degrees of separation are few.\n\nShe narrows her eyes now as she talks about Weinstein and the #MeToo era. The most interesting thing about the documentary, she says, was not that so many people turned a blind eye to the behaviour of Weinstein and co, but rather \u201cthe way things evolved\u201d.\n\nShe tells how recently she read an interview with Anjelica Huston in which the actor was talking about Roman Polanski. \u201cShe said a great thing about how when she grew up we were living in a sort of Playboy culture, where you had these women of their own volition dressing like rabbits, in their underwear, and that was cool at the time. And all the older guys were used to hitting on young girls because the girls were offering themselves up on a plate. Now I\u2019ve seen that unfold over three more decades and you can see the way it went.\u201d\n\nShe believes the music industry is yet to have its #MeToo moment \u201cbecause the girls were groupies and they really were offering themselves up\u201d. And while The Pretenders may have had a few \u201changers-on\u201d, there were never any male groupies. \u201cA male groupie is a fan,\u201d she explains firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. A male groupie is not someone who\u2019s going to offer you a blow job.\u201d\n\nThere are very few female rock musicians who have enjoyed the success and longevity of Hynde, and though she is feted as a trailblazer and feminist role model, she refuses to wholly play the part. \u201cI was never hit on, and no one ever suggested I do anything,\u201d she says. \u201cSexism and discrimination never came into it with my band. It was all about having some songs and playing them. I\u2019ve never had a problem! It\u2019s fantastic. But now I\u2019m apologetic. Because people, especially women, are always like, \u2018Didn\u2019t you have to work harder?\u2019 And I\u2019m like \u2018No\u2019.\u201d\n\nWe are in her publicist\u2019s office. Hynde is looking out over the streets of Marylebone, over the station awning to the building opposite, once one of the great Victorian railway hotels. She remembers when it was still the Regent, and when it was empty, and when the stretch of paving in front of it appeared in the Beatles\u2019 film A Hard Day\u2019s Night. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing now,\u201d she says. \u201cWherever I go I remember the buildings as they were. And no one else knows it because I\u2019m older than everyone now.\u201d\n\nHynde turned 68 two days before we meet, an occasion she celebrated by releasing her 15th album, Valve Bone Woe \u2013 an unexpected jazz dub covers collection in which she turns her smudgy, languorous voice to everything from Hoagy Carmichael\u2019s \u201cI Get Along Very Well Without You (Except Sometimes)\u201d to Nick Drake\u2019s \u201cRiver Man\u201d. It\u2019s no schmaltzy retrospective, rather the fruits of a long-running project with producer Marius de Vries, an experiment in melody, and a nod to the Charles Mingus records she heard drifting from her brother\u2019s record player as a teen.\n\nThis afternoon she sits at the office conference table in a hooded sweatshirt, eating a black jack she swiftly regrets. She talks lightly and somewhat dutifully about the new record, but her conversational topics are many and various, ranging across everything from the early days of The Pretenders, growing up in Akron, Ohio, London\u2019s punk clubs of the Seventies, the writing of Niall Ferguson, her late-flowering love for karaoke, and her furious passion for Mark Morrison\u2019s 1996 single \u201cReturn of the Mack\u201d: \u201cI lived for that,\u201d she says. At one point she pauses and enjoys a breath of contemplation. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she declares, \u201cI\u2019m an expert on everything.\u201d\n\nWhen she moved to London from the US in 1973 it was not with any great plan. An art school graduate who could play the guitar, \u201call I knew was what I didn\u2019t want to do, and I didn\u2019t want to be a waitress,\u201d she remembers. Amid London\u2019s burgeoning punk scene, she knew that to be a girl in a band would be a novelty, \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want that either.\u201d And yet she was desperate to play. Her \u201clove of wanting to be in a band\u201d had to override many things: the shyness she felt playing guitar around her male counterparts, \u201chaving no money, working illegally, coming here and not knowing anyone,\u201d she lists. \u201cIt\u2019s not even about self-belief, it\u2019s not about confidence, it\u2019s just about loving music.\u201d\n\nShe has two daughters, Natalie, from a relationship with Ray Davies of The Kinks, and Yasmin, from her marriage to Jim Kerr of Simple Minds. Motherhood placed an intermission in her flourishing career. \u201cWell, like any other woman I just couldn\u2019t do it for a while,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t tour for about eight years. I obviously was very distracted a lot of the time. And writing rock songs... the whole mindset changes.\u201d Still, she believes that motherhood has given her a creative longevity \u201cbecause you don\u2019t burn yourself out, because you have to restrain yourself for a while and pull back\u201d.\n\nFor the first time it\u2019s not a break-up album. For the first time I\u2019m writing about other stuff\n\nHynde describes herself as now coming into \u201ca quiet time\u201d in her life \u2013 by which she means that since her daughters left home a hush has descended over her life. \u201cI live alone,\u201d she explains. \u201cI forget to put the radio on, or I can\u2019t find a station I like, or they\u2019re playing marching bands on Radio 3 and I\u2019m like \u2018I can\u2019t listen to that!\u2019 Then I just turn it off.\u201d Sometimes she wonders what it might be like if someone else were there. \u201cIf they put on some Japanese flute music or some Chet Baker I\u2019m sure I would luxuriate in it,\u201d she supposes.\n\nAt 60 she gave up smoking, drinking and taking drugs. \u201cAlcohol is the real demonic one,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so insidious because it\u2019s everywhere and it\u2019s the gateway to more debauched drugs.\u201d She got sober in pretty much the same way she gave up smoking \u2013 by reading Alan Carr\u2019s Easy Way to Stop Smoking and then \u201cyou bite the bullet for a week\u201d. She had contemplated giving up for years. \u201cYou wake up and you\u2019re disgusted, and you throw it all away, and you say never again, and then you repeat it. And then there\u2019s the self-loathing. Now I\u2019m not recovering, I\u2019m fully recovered. I never think about it.\u201d Instead she has cultivated other preoccupations \u2013 she paints most days and does yoga each morning, wherever she is, pushing back the furniture in hotels and dressing rooms to run through her routine. \u201cI stand on my head,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019m good to go.\u201d\n\nA longstanding campaigner for animal rights, she supports a farm in Rutland where the fields are ploughed by oxen and the calves never separated from the cows. \u201cI think every 10 years, animal rights, like feminism, takes on a different complexion according to the way the world is working,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to review it and update it.\u201d Today she is frustrated by many animal rights\u2019 groups attitudes towards the farming community. \u201cBecause of industrial farming [all] farmers have been vilified,\u201d she explains, \u201cand that\u2019s wrong, because we need farmers.\u201d\n\nStill she seems today propelled by a kind of irresistible hope. \u201cI think we\u2019re in such a great moment now,\u201d she beams. \u201cI think it\u2019s almost like a renaissance we\u2019re going through, and no one else seems to notice it \u2013 I find it very peculiar, because there\u2019s so many positive changes.\u201d She discusses a few of them: electric cars, Extinction Rebellion, the widespread availability of vegan food, gay rights. There are minor frustrations, of course \u2013 Trump and Brexit among them, \u201cBut that\u2019s just a passing thing!\u201d she swats them away. \u201cThese are real things! It\u2019s unbelievable the changes in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nEarly next year she will head out on tour once again with The Pretenders. Sixty US cities with the band Journey (of \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d fame). She enjoys touring \u2013 the movement, the music, the hotels. She mourns only the fact that she will not be able to do her own laundry. \u201cThis sounds really frivolous,\u201d she laughs, \u201cbut I have one of those Lazy Maids, they\u2019re fantastic \u2013 every time I do all my laundry and I get it up there and it\u2019s all perfectly flat, I think, \u2018God I\u2019ll miss you when I\u2019m on tour.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe tour will promote a new Pretenders album, co-written with the band\u2019s guitarist. \u201cWhen I first started writing, I could only do it alone with a guitar,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to collaborate.\u201d She remembers the time she met Bob Dylan, and he told her, \u201cHey, we should write some tunes!\u201d (Hynde, incidentally, does a mean Dylan impersonation). She balked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to write with someone. I blew it off man!\u201d she pauses and a smile rumples across her face. \u201cI mean it was probably just a come on line,\u201d she says. \u201cBob comes on to everyone.\u201d\n\nShe runs through some of the new album\u2019s themes \u2013 from turf accountants to addiction. \u201cThey\u2019re not relationship songs,\u201d she says gladly. \u201cI read all the time about break-up albums and all of mine have been break-up albums, but I just never told anyone! Now, for the first time it\u2019s not a break-up album. For the first time I\u2019m writing about other stuff.\u201d\n\nOne of the new songs is about loneliness: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m glad I got rid of you but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be this lonely...\u2019 \u2013 that sort of theme,\u201d she explains. Is she lonely? She considers the idea for a moment. \u201cLiving alone is hard work,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be diligent at all times. Because there is no conversation. But it frees up all this other time to explore other things. That\u2019s why I feel like I\u2019m 15 now, because I live exactly like I did when I was 15, but I\u2019m not worried about what I\u2019m going to do with my life. All the hard stuff is behind me. All I have to worry about now is death.\u201d Does she worry about that? \u201cNo!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d\n\nShe is distracted suddenly by something outside the window. \u201cSorry, look at those crows!\u201d she says. \u201cLook at that huge one on the awning there! And there\u2019s the other one over there, I see, they\u2019ve probably got something going on between them.\u201d She watches the birds in rapt silence for a couple of moments. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says, thoughts returning to the room and the conversation. \u201cLoneliness is a really interesting subject.\u201d She lists the pleasures of being alone in a city, the day spread out precisely as you want it. \u201cJust being able to do what you want and how great that is,\u201d she smiles. \u201cI am a loner, I realise that now.\u201d\n\nValve Bone Woe is out now", "description": "There is a question that nags away at Chrissie Hynde, now some four decades into her music career: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t more women get into bands?\u201d She frowns and scrunches her eyes.
