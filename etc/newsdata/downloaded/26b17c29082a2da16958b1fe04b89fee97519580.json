Another 80 percent said they definitely would not vote for her, also marking a six percent increase and a record high.\n\nThe institute had a sample range of 1,004 people between September 30 and October 3 by landline and mobile phone.\n\nHer collapse in popularity comes as pro-democracy demonstrations continue across the city as part of a pushback against China\u2019s increasing interference in their internal affairs, widely seen as a betrayal of the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d agreement with the British Empire.\n\nThe protests initially began in June as a response to a proposed extradition bill that would allow China to command Hong Kong to extradite individuals present in the city. Lam promised protesters the Legislative Council would withdraw the bill, but lawmakers have taken no concrete steps to do so. Protesters have added four demands to their list: the release of political prisoners, an investigation into police brutality, direct election of lawmakers, and an end to the government referring to them incorrectly as \u201crioters.\u201d\n\nLam, who owes her position entirely to Beijing, has previously admitted that she would like to resign but Chinese authorities forbade her. Since that confession, Lam has threatened to pass laws curbing the freedom of the press and imposed a ban on facemasks, commonly used to protect from tear gas.\n\nThis week, Lam confirmed that she would not rule out asking to China to intervene if \u201climitless and lawless\u201d violence continues to ravage the semi-autonomous city.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, I still strongly feel that we should find the solutions ourselves. It is also the position of the central government that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own,\u201d Lam said at a press conference. \u201cBut if the situation becomes so bad, then no options can be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Hong Kong's pro-China CEO Carrie Lam\u2019s popularity rating plunged furthur, making her the least popular leader in the region's history.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/wi/ap/16/96accf_aptopix-hong-kong-protests-84299-carrie-lam-hong-kong-chief-executive-carrie-e1570643078950-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
