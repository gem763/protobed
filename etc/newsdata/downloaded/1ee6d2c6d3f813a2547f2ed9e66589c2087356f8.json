However, Radio Free Asia published a very similar report on Oct. 21.\n\n\"This is the best time for China to invest in North Korea,\" the CBC report quoted a North Korean government official in Shenyang as saying.\n\nAs 2019 marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the official said, it would be \"easier to negotiate with the Chinese authorities\" at the current time.\n\nHowever, one Chinese rare earth industry source said such an agreement was \"wishful thinking\" on behalf of North Korea and queried the real level of Chinese interest in the project.\n\n\"Investing in North Korea is not safe. Its international reputation is poor and many companies will not necessarily be interested,\" said the source, who declined to be identified.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the scheme would comply with UN sanctions.
