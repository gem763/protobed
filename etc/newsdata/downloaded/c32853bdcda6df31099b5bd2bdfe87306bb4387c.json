High-profile agents want to sell his book. And now, it appears Congress wants to hear from Bolton, too\u2014his lawyers are reportedly arranging a deposition.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut no one should get too excited about what Bolton will ultimately say. If he testifies before the congressional inquiry, Bolton will bring more to the hearing room than recollections about the Trump White House. A look at his career\u2014which has been animated by the fight for a strong presidency, especially on matters of foreign policy\u2014suggests his testimony is unlikely to be everything the resistance wants to hear.\n\nLike many in his generation of Republican foreign policy operatives, Bolton began developing his views about the power of the presidency at its nadir. After serving as an intern in Richard Nixon\u2019s White House and graduating from Yale Law School, Bolton opted not to return to an administration mired in Watergate and instead headed into private practice. In his first days as an associate at Covington & Burling, Bolton watched as Nixon was \u201cforced to resign in disgrace,\u201d as he later put it in a memoir.\n\nBolton\u2019s phrasing was purposeful: In the Watergate era, he saw how an \u201coverreacting\u201d Congress, as he later called it, could limit the president\u2019s authority\u2014for example, with the War Powers Act and independent counsel statute. On campaign finance in particular, Bolton soon made a name for himself and (a decent living) during Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration, litigating against some of the perceived congressional overreach.\n\nBolton continued that fight when he joined Ronald Reagan\u2019s Justice Department. As assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, Bolton handled some of Congress\u2019 investigations into the Iran-Contra affair, in which some White House aides sold weapons to Iran and then illegally funneled the proceeds to the so-called Contras battling the socialist government in Nicaragua. A decade after Watergate, the scandal set off a firestorm of investigations and questions about the power of the presidency.\n\nEven though the president took responsibility for the mess and did not invoke executive privilege during it, Bolton considered the whole inquiry an \u201cassault on the Reagan presidency,\u201d he later wrote. At the time, he accused special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, a former judge appointed to investigate Iran-Contra, of using a \u201cwacko theory\u201d of law and spending too much money.\n\nBolton was not alone: Then-Congressman Dick Cheney opposed the investigation and any attempts to interfere with presidential foreign policy prerogatives. To Cheney and Bolton, Iran-Contra became an important front in the bigger war to rebuild the power of the presidency. In testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee, Bolton called the post-Watergate Ethics in Government Act, which included appointments of independent counsels, \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d He argued in the hearing that, \u201cunder the constitutional system of separation of powers, the president or his delegate, must retain the unfettered ability to direct and supervise all executive officials.\u201d\n\nBolton did not even believe Congress should investigate an actual drug deal. Upon reports that allies of the Contras were also involved in drug running, then-Senator John Kerry sought to get to the bottom of it, only to run into resistance from Bolton. The assistant attorney general stalled requests for information. Then, according to reports by journalist David Corn and others, Bolton worked with Republican members of the committee to end the investigation. One Senate staffer claimed Bolton had \u201ctried to torpedo\u201d the attempt at oversight.\n\nAfter the Reagan presidency, Bolton, Cheney and their allies continued a long, patient crusade to strengthen the presidency, especially with regard to foreign policy. During the George W. Bush administration, they \u201csupported vigorous executive authority to protect our national security after the 9/11 attacks,\u201d as Bolton and a fellow lawyer later wrote. That included Bolton\u2019s own ambassadorship at the United Nations, which was only achieved through a recess appointment Bush made after Senate Democrats had blocked the nomination in Congress.\n\nAs a result of intellectual, administrative and legislative efforts by Bolton and other conservative lawyers, lobbyists and scholars, the presidency recovered much of the authority it had lost after Watergate and Iran-Contra, arguably becoming even more powerful during the post-9/11 wars. Bolton\u2019s long-term belief in the power of the presidency, in fact, is one reason he could work for Trump in the first place, despite his resistance to several Trump policies, on North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan: Bolton could defer, however grudgingly, because he has long believed the president gets the ultimate say.\n\nAlthough Bolton is now free from Trump, having left the White House in September after 17 months on the job, he faces a similar challenge in the Ukraine investigation, which is shaping up to be in part about the president\u2019s authority over foreign policy. Bolton again has to decide whether to give up on long-held beliefs\u2014this time about the power of the presidency\u2014to be popular in Washington. Of course, subpoenas have a way of making decisions easier. Bolton could just go along to get along, deciding to exact some revenge on Trump with a deposition filled with a detailed litany of any presidential crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nBut subpoenas rarely change anyone\u2019s mind, let alone one as disciplined and devoted as Bolton\u2019s. The power of the modern presidency is Bolton\u2019s career legacy, a project he has been working on longer than North Korea, Iran or any one issue. When Trump and his defenders question the legitimacy of today\u2019s inquiry, they\u2019re not just speaking Bolton\u2019s language\u2014they\u2019re using his talking points. Even if Bolton soured on Trump or disagreed with his Ukraine scheme, the current resident of the White House is unlikely to have changed the former national security adviser\u2019s belief that the United States needs a strong commander in chief.\n\nFor that reason, Bolton\u2019s decision to consider providing a deposition is as momentous as it surely was tortured. His testimony will likely be the same. Such discomfort might be the reason for the awkwardness of the leaked line that so elated Twitter last week. According to reports about former National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill\u2019s private congressional testimony, Bolton, her boss, apparently wanted it clear, \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal [U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon] Sondland and [White House chief of staff Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up\u201d in Ukraine. Again, the phrasing matters: If Sondland and Mulvaney were doing the cooking, the president wasn\u2019t.\n\nWe should expect more of those sorts of phrases, distinctions and qualifications from Bolton if he testifies. As he did during his tenure as national security adviser, Bolton will seek to keep his hands clean and stay true to his principles, even if he is participating in something that challenges them. Ultimately, Bolton might be willing to undermine a president for pursuing an operation that would appear to violate Bolton\u2019s policy preferences and view of the law. But he is unlikely to undermine the presidency\u2014and principles like executive privilege\u2014any more than he has to.\n\nToward the end of the Bush administration, in response to a decision about North Korea that Bolton opposed, he wrote, \u201cNothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency, like this one, in total intellectual collapse.\u201d Whenever Bolton finally has his say about Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal, it is likely to be uttered not in anger but in sorrow, not gaily but grudgingly, and in the narrowest way possible. For Bolton, there is something sadder than a presidency\u2019s decline: the collapse of the office itself.", "description": "The president\u2019s former national security adviser might have opposed the Ukraine scheme.
