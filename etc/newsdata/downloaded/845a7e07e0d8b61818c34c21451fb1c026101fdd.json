She had been detained for dressing as a man to enter a stadium.\n\nKhodayari's death caused widespread outrage in Iran and internationally, prompting calls on social media for the country's football federation to be suspended or banned by FIFA.\n\n190910170109925\n\nCritics say FIFA's own statutes hold discrimination on grounds of gender punishable by suspension or expulsion.\n\nWhile foreign women have been allowed limited access to matches, Iranian women have been banned from stadiums when men's teams have been playing, since just after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nThere were signs the situation regarding female fans in Iran was changing when a group of women was permitted to attend the second leg of the Asian Champions League final in Tehran last November, a match where Infantino was present.\n\nFemale fans, however, have been denied access to matches since. At Iran's friendly against Syria in June, women were locked out of the 78,000-capacity Azadi Stadium in Tehran and detained by security forces, according to Reuters news agency.", "description": "Body's president says Iranian officials have guaranteed that women will be allowed to attend match against Cambodia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/10/194272b361874aed8da5dc2987b2dc6c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
