Security experts and supporters of further changes say the news is not all good.\n\nFor all the new voting equipment expected to be fielded by Election Day 2020, roughly 16 million Americans are expected to cast votes that leave no paper record, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.\n\nMany machines also likely will continue to run on obsolete software, further complicating the potential cybersecurity exposure. One hacker who experimented with an election machine at a conference in Las Vegas told NPR he wouldn't trust the equipment's software to run his toaster.\n\nThere's also no guarantee that an influence campaign targeting the United States in 2020 might look like the last big one.\n\nIt could rely more on spreading sophisticated fake media than on the past campaign's comparatively simple posts and memes. Its political dimensions could be different in terms of the candidates or parties who stand to benefit. The nations involved could be different too.\n\nPresident Trump already has charged China with trying to make a case against him among Americans because Beijing has wearied of the trade war with Washington. The Chinese have sponsored some overt messaging that makes plain their unhappiness \u2014 will that include a clandestine effort, too?\n\nIn 2016, Russia's interference campaign was aimed at helping Trump and hurting his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Since then, Russia and China have grown strategically closer. Russia also has become a big booster for China in its official messaging, according to one report from the Alliance for Securing Democracy.\n\nLooking ahead to prospective interference in 2020 requires asking whether these new dynamics might prompt Russia to sit out another big wave of active measures, whether it might join China in opposing Trump, if Beijing in fact does \u2014 or whether these allies could pick opposite sides in the U.S. election.\n\nTrump and his allies have emphasized how many nations other than Russia are involved with trying to influence the U.S.\n\nFighting the next war\n\nThe names of the players might not be the only difference in 2020 as compared with the earlier election. The techniques might be different, too.\n\nFor example, Paul Barrett of New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights warned in a report that influence-mongers might make greater use of different social platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nKatherine Charlet and Danielle Citron of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote in a commentary that they worry about high-quality fake video and audio. One fear is these fake media could begin to circulate with corrosive effects on Americans' confidence about what they see and hear.\n\nAnd the Department of Homeland Security has said it wants to help elections officials safeguard against ransomwear \u2014 attacks in which governments lose access to their own networks unless they pay the attackers.\n\nRansomwear has crippled some American cities and although it hasn't yet disrupted an election, Department of Homeland Security officials worry that state, county or other elections systems could be a future target.\n\nIf the outlook is uncertain, what is also clear is that attitudes across the board have changed, too. Political campaigns, federal officials, state and local supervisors and many voters are going into 2020 with their eyes open in a way that's seldom been the case for U.S. elections.\n\nThat may not mean the coming months necessarily run smoothly. Lt. Gen. Stephen Fogarty, head of U.S. Army Cyber Command, was asked about the outlook for his Russian counterparts. He told an audience in Washington that he expected the back-and-forth in cyberspace to be energetic.\n\n\"It's going to be pretty sporty, actually,\" Fogarty said.\n\nPam Fessler, Miles Parks, Tim Mak and Ryan Lucas contributed to this report.", "description": "Officials at every level say they're changing their approaches to election security as the presidential race comes into view.
