They might be updated, but they haven't entirely succumbed to the beer taps and kombucha vibe.\n\nMore importantly, Moufarrige says, his co-location spaces (\"co-lo\" in industry-speak) come with technology systems to provide back-office support and are on average 11 sq m compared with WeWork's squishier 4 sq m.\n\nBeer on ice\n\nAs for beer? They trialled it in a few sites, but he doesn't believe it creates a real working environment, though a beer tap does remain in the head office.\n\nBut that's racing ahead. There's no doubt Servcorp has had an underwhelming few years, WeWork-inflicted or otherwise.\n\nLast month, Servcorp beat its second-half guidance \u2013 reporting $18.4 million net profit before tax compared with its forecast of between $14 million and $18 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was an important result for a company that has missed its own guidance at least three times, partly because it underestimated the impact that refurbishments would have on its occupancy rate. Moreover, Servcorp declared it was optimistic about the outlook; even before the severity of the WeWork trouble became public.\n\nBut is that enough for Servcorp to clamber back towards the $8 share price level it hit around 2017, with its shares now trading closer to $4?\n\nTo its supporters, the resetting of an irrational competitor is just one positive in the bull case, which centres on a company that has all but completed a $60 million office refurbishment, is throwing off cash and is trading at a discount to peers such as the UK's IWG (the owner of Regus was approached by multiple buyout funds, but ended talks last August).\n\nBetter options\n\nTo its detractors, there are simply better options out there: the business is mature compared with micro-cap Victory Offices or even Wotso; there's key-man risk in the form of Moufarrige and a weaker economic environment would hurt earnings.\n\nCyan Investment Management's Dean Fergie says there's an element of \"market fatigue\" surrounding Servcorp, and that his fund owns shares in microcap Victory Offices, which can grow far quicker from a much lower base. He is also attracted to Victory's corporate customer base.\n\nOn the other side, Fidelity has been buying shares and has emerged as a substantial shareholder. And LHC Capital, which was the top performing hedge fund 2018-19, told clients in its June quarterly report it had bought more Servcorp shares in the past three months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We believe Servcorp is now poised to harvest cash, driven by the stronger occupancy rates and decreased capital spend at a time when market expectations for the business are relatively modest,\" the report said.\n\nAside from WeWork, Servcorp has had its problems.\n\nIn particular, it has struggled to enter the US market successfully and is still losing between $8 million and $10 million a year.\n\nTo put that in perspective, the US turns over $2 million a month compared with the company's $32 million a month, but it's an issue Moufarrige says bluntly is \"a pain in the bum\".\n\n\"I haven't got the answer to the US and I was there last week ... we still struggle in the US ... the end is not yet in sight,\" he says, adding that one element the company has got wrong is that it comes across in its marketing as a little Australian company in a market that doesn't want that.\n\nAlf Moufarrige listed Servcorp in 1999, after founding the office space group in 1978. Rob Homer\n\nIn December, chief operating officer Marcus Moufarrige and his father's anointed successor, left the company after a few years trying to fix the US. So did his brother Taine, a Servcorp director.\n\nAnd in August, long-term chairman Bruce Corlett (he has been chairman since Servcorp listed in 1999) said he would retire at the next annual meeting. He will be replaced by Mark Vaile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorlett's reasoning that he was turning 75 this year didn't do much to comfort those who question how much longer Moufarrige (he's a few years older) will want to stay in the business, but the board moves did go some way to address concerns the business was too dominated by family and long-term business confidantes.\n\nAnother big concern is that an economic slowdown would clear out tenants from the offices. That was certainly the case during the global financial crisis.\n\n\"We are a cyclical business. When the markets turn down \u2013 which they do \u2013 you lose a lot of clients,\" Moufarrige says, pointing out that he's in the business of selling short-term leases over longer-term ones and there's a lot more to it than just a rent arbitrage.\n\nFor one, he says the technology spending \u2013 it's been greater than marketing for the past 10 years \u2013 means the business is better able to utilise and book out spaces, as well as communicate with the 60,000 or so clients.\n\nHe also points out that Servcorp is used to turning over its client base. About 60 per cent of its space needs to be resold the following year.\n\nAlso, he expects that the co-working tenants \u2013 a newer revenue stream \u2013 will not be hit as hard as office space. Co-working space is likely to be less affected than the office spaces that get cancelled so the teams can go back to their head office.\n\n\"On a per square metre basis, we have more income from co-working per square metre than anybody else in the industry, because we've done virtual for close to four years,\" he says, referring to the systems that include receptionists and booking systems, allowing people to move between different office spaces.\n\nSo what would happen if there was an approach? Would the company look at spinning off one of its divisions, as it considered in the Middle East a few years ago?\n\n\"Servcorp is not for sale,\" Moufarrige says, adding that it was approached as recently as last month.\n\n\"There are so many opportunities. The places we are really booming in are where we have more WeWork competition: Australia, the UK, Japan. Servcorp is in a fairly comfortable position ... I think the Australian investors underestimate it.\"", "description": "Servcorp was tipped to go under because of WeWork.
