Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel said of Perry. \u201cThese reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.\"\n\nTwo associates of Trump lawyer and confidant Rudy Giuliani who have been linked to his efforts to conduct investigations in Ukraine were indicted for campaign finance violations, according to court documents released Thursday. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are accused of using a limited liability company to make political contributions related to American elections, which violates Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules barring contributions from foreign nationals.\n\nGIULIANI ASSOCIATES ARRESTED WHILE TRYING TO BOARD INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT WITH ONE-WAY TICKETS, PROSECUTORS SAY\n\nThe expanding impeachment probe was launched last month after an intelligence community member's whistleblower complaint raised concerns about the president's Ukraine phone call. In it, Trump asked Zelensky to probe onetime Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter and their business dealings in Ukraine. Joe Biden has for months been seen as the Democrats' frontrunner in the 2020 election against Trump.\n\nTrump has denied abusing his position, saying the call was \"perfect,\" and Zelensky said Thursday there was \"no blackmail\" during their call.\n\nThe whistleblower accused the president of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\" claiming Trump used $400 million in military aid, frozen in the days before that fateful phone call, to induce Zelensky to open a Biden inquiry.\n\nTrump reportedly told House Republicans it was Perry who suggested he call Zelensky back in July, according to news outlet Axios.\n\nRICK PERRY DENIES DISCUSSING BIDENS WITH TRUMP OR UKRAINE OFFICIALS: REPORTS\n\nAccording to one source, Trump said something to the effect of: \"Not a lot of people know this but, I didn't even want to make the call. The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquified natural gas] plant,\" Axios reported, saying two other sources agreed with that recollection.\n\nPerry denied ever mentioning the Bidens during discussions with Ukrainian officials or the president. On Friday he told the Christian Broadcasting Network in an exclusive interview that his dealings in Ukraine were part of the United States' effort to clean up corruption there.\n\nPresident Trump has said Joe Biden's efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the energy firm Burisma Holdings -- where Hunter Biden had held a board seat -- should be investigated for corruption.\n\nOn Monday, Perry denied rumors that he would resign at the end of November amid questions about his role in the controversy surrounding the now-infamous Trump-Zelensky call.\n\nREAD THE WHITE HOUSE LETTER\n\nThe White House issued an eight-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Tuesday and said it wouldn't comply with the \"illegitimate and unconstitutional\" impeachment inquiry.\n\nFox News' John Roberts, Ronn Blitzer, Dom Calicchio, Louis Casiano and Charles Creitz contributed to this report.", "description": "Energy Secretary Rick Perry became the latest Trump administration official to be subpoenaed on Thursday by a trio of House Democratic chairman who requested documents relating to Ukraine as part of their impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19276859212445.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
