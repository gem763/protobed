In public statements, Honda and BMW both said they will cooperate with the department.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to responding to the Department of Justice to explain the planned CARB framework agreement and its benefits to consumers and the environment,\u201d BMW said in a statement.\n\nThe Trump administration and California have bitterly feuded over several environmental actions.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra slammed the antitrust probe, making reference to this week\u2019s controversy over Mr. Trump or someone else in the White House apparently marking up a weather map with a Sharpie pen to add a portion of Alabama into an area NOAA had predicted could be impacted by Hurricane Dorian.\n\n\u201cLooks like President Trump is reaching for his Sharpie again, this time against automakers willing to combat auto pollution,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWish he and his administration took antitrust violations seriously and focused on real anti-competitive antitrust behavior.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, called the investigation \u201cfrivolous\u201d saying the Trump administration was using the Justice Department for its own political purposes.\n\n\n\n\u201cFar from hindering healthy competition, California\u2019s agreement promotes a race-to-the-top among automakers to meet the new emission standards, benefiting consumers, strengthening our economy and protecting our environment,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe Department of Justice must end this sham investigation and return to policing actual anticompetitive conduct.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
