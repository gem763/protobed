More than a decade after its 2007 premiere, the CBS sitcom, which famously chronicles a group of smart pals who are bad at fake-eating, will finally be available to stream for the first time outside the constraints of the network: On, yes, HBO Max, a.k.a. the WarnerMedia platform that\u2019s recently gobbled up Friends, Pretty Little Liars, and the full Doctor Who catalogue. (On top of commissioning a lot of original films and series. Meryl alert!) Per a press release, all 12 seasons and 279 episodes will be available to stream in the U.S. when the service launches in spring 2020. Additionally, if you love reruns, TBBT will continue to air on TBS until at least 2028. Get psyched, Nobel laureates!", "description": "\u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d will be joining \u201cFriends\u201d on HBO Max.
