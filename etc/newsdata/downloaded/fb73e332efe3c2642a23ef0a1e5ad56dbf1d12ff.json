Yesterday, at Kate Spade, we saw more models of all ages, and that was just the beginning of an appealingly, casually inclusive runway.\n\nSet in a garden, the show was filled with smiling women carrying tote bags and potted plants \u2014 as if we\u2019d caught them all on the way back from the farmer\u2019s market. Along with traditional runway models, the women walking included influencers, celebrities, and various cool New Yorkers. Multiple generations were represented, including one model who was pregnant.\n\nCurve models like Stella Duval were included for the first time, alongside runway veterans Karen Elson and Grace Elizabeth. The brand asked influencers Vanessa Hong, Reese and Molly Blustein, and Lyn Slater to walk, plus a few art-world citizens, including curators Kimberly Drew and Nicola Vassell and filmmaker Celia Rowlson Hall. Rounding out the group was actress Molly Gordon of Booksmart, plus Debi Mazur and her daughter, Evelina Corcos.\n\nThe styling emphasized each person\u2019s own taste, as if to say that plenty of real-world women wear Kate Spade in plenty of different ways. We left the show feeling refreshingly uncynical \u2014 maybe this is the new normal.\n\nPhoto: \u00a9DAN AND CORINA LECCA/Courtesy of Kate Spade Curator Kimberly Drew\n\nPhoto: \u00a9DAN AND CORINA LECCA/Courtesy of Kate Spade Debi Mazur and her daughter Evelina Corcos.\n\nPhoto: \u00a9DAN AND CORINA LECCA/Courtesy of Kate Spade Influencer Vanessa Hong of The Haute Pursuit\n\nCurve model Stella Duval.
