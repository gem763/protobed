To gain funding and support for their work, scientists must communicate its value and its \u201cbroader impacts,\u201d or the ways in which it benefits society. And bringing a human element to scientific research connects scientists to others outside the lab, hospital or classroom, building a wider sense of why science matters and letting everyone in on the results and implications of the research.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen scientists get personal about their experiences, the results can be hilarious (as when ecologist Cylita Guy is handed stinky bags of live bats \u2014 and has a surprising run-in with a pack of drunken observers \u2014 while doing fieldwork) or sobering (as when surgeon Bhuvanesh Singh explores his failure to save a patient despite a surgery he thought was successful).\n\nThe stories show the very human side of science: fear, trust, doubt, triumph. They\u2019re devastating, delightful, and endlessly listenable. Ready to hear (or tell) a science story? Visit the organization at Storycollider.org to get started. There, you can find an upcoming show near you, listen to past stories on the podcast or pitch a tale that involves science.\n\nAD", "description": "The Story Collider is a nonprofit group that helps experts, laymen shape stories about biology, geology and other fields, and puts on live shows and a podcast.", "authors": ["Erin Blakemore"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oWAL-uFvtNHu3y_vlDBnHmIwQ58=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VFDAEQXWNQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
