As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 The Green Bay Packers didn\u2019t hold a lead for a single second on the game clock Monday night against the Detroit Lions, but they came away with a 5-1 record anyway.\n\nMason Crosby\u2019s 23-yard field goal as time expired lifted the Packers to a 23-22 win, completing a comeback from what was once a 13-point deficit in the second quarter.\n\nThe win kept the Packers atop the NFC North. They are now one of four NFC teams with five wins this season.\n\nFittingly, here are five observations on the victory.\n\n1. Lions gonna Lions\n\nThree huge penalties on the Lions helped swing this game. In the first half, Detroit had stopped the Packers, but the Lions lined up with too many men on the field before the ensuing field goal. The Packers capitalized on the automatic first down for their first touchdown, pulling within 13-7. In the fourth quarter, the Lions again had the Packers stopped on third down, this time forcing them to punt. But an illegal-hands-to-the-face penalty on Trey Flowers gave the Packers an automatic first down, and they scored three plays later on a 35-yard strike from Aaron Rodgers to Allen Lazard. Then another illegal-hands-to-the-face penalty on Flowers allowed the Packers to run the clock down before their game-winning field goal. Those three penalties cost the Lions 14 points, and a win.\n\nBLAME THEM, NOT REFS: Lions blow massive opportunity vs. Packers at Lambeau\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to receive football news in your inbox\n\n2. Allen Lazard emerging\n\nThe Packers clearly missed top receiver Davante Adams, but they perhaps found something in Allen Lazard. Lazard led the Packers in receptions, including a 35-yard touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter. His four catches for 65 yards all came after halftime. If not for Geronimo Allison\u2019s chest injury \u2014 Allison was also being evaluated for a concussion \u2014 Lazard might not have received a single target. There\u2019s no telling whether Lazard\u2019s big game was a one-hit wonder or something the Packers can build on, but it\u2019s certainly worth exploring as the Packers continue to lack their Pro Bowl receiver.\n\n3. Dual-back offense\n\nAnyone thinking the Packers might double down on Aaron Jones\u2019 heavy usage from last week with Jamaal Williams back on the field was mistaken. Not that Jones didn\u2019t get the ball Monday night \u2014 his 47 yards on 11 carries and four catches for 13 yards were not far off the ideal pace \u2014 but the night really belonged to the bulldozing Williams. Fresh back from the concussion protocol, Williams had 104 yards on 14 rushes. The duo used their power-and-slashing style to complement themselves nicely. They were the offense\u2019s highlight on this night.\n\nPreston Smith reacts after a sack in the third quarter against the Lions. (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n4. Za\u2019Darius and Preston Smith sparkle\n\nFor a moment Monday night, Za\u2019Darius Smith leapfrogged teammate Preston Smith for the team lead in sacks. He had his sixth of the season in the second quarter, beating two blockers to drag down Matthew Stafford for a 5-yard loss on third-and-13. Then Preston Smith answered with two sacks of his own, bringing his season total to 7\u00bd. The Smiths have been revelations for the Packers defense all season, and they\u2019re far outproducing expectations. Preston Smith is just a half sack behind his single-season career high of eight. Za\u2019Darius Smith is only 2\u00bd sacks from his career high.\n\n5. Lions play safe\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a pair of penalties that doomed the Lions. Out to a hot start, they had a chance to really put the Packers in a bind early in the second quarter. The Lions had fourth-and-goal from the 4-yard line, up 10-0. Instead of going for the jugular, coach Matt Patricia played it safe. The short field goal was a sure way to get points, but it surpassed the chance to take a three-possession lead, which would be significant for a road underdog. The Lions then booted the ensuing kickoff out of bounds, and allowed the Packers their first touchdown on the short field. That\u2019s a good way of sparking a comeback. Or, in the Lions\u2019 case, a collapse.\n\nFollow Packers News' Ryan Wood on Twitter @ByRyanWood.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
