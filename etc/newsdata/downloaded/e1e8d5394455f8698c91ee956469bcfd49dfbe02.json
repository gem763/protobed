Well, it can be and I\u2019ll blooming show you how!\n\nWe about enter the 10 days we all dread and despair: the international break.\n\nWhile you\u2019re sat at home, missing the Premier League, and wondering what to do with your weekend, you can drown your sorrows in my \u201cjunk food\u201d. I promise you, it will get you through.\n\nHere\u2019s the menu: Burger and Chips with a chocolate brownie!! I know... I can almost hear you thinking, \u201cPhwoooooar, I\u2019ll have a bit of that\u201d\n\nAnd you can. But here\u2019s the thing: the burger, it\u2019s actually veggie.\n\nNow, before all the meat lovers rush off and close this article, screaming \u201cif it\u2019s not meat I don\u2019t eat\u201d, just bare with with me. It\u2019s worth it.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s a black bean burger with a chipotle mayo, pickles and, of course, that beautiful brioche bun.\n\nI did this recipe a long time ago for a brand I was working with where I had to create vegan dishes to go along with their campaign and it did really well.\n\nI\u2019ll give you the full recipe as I\u2019ve used this on players in the past who have gone down the veggie route but still wanted to eat, well, \u2018crap\u2019 - or at least have the home comforts of eating the naughty things in life.\n\n(Image: chef_jonnymarsh /Instagram)\n\nI can see how sneaky this could get. Try and fool whoever it is you\u2019re cooking for and see whether they notice the black bean burger as meat or veggie, because when you cook it and plonk it between two buns, it doesnt half look like it\u2019s meat counterpart. Trust me.\n\nAnd for afters, let me turn to the brownie - my god! Like, my word\u2026 what a treat you\u2019re in for.\n\nThese are heavenly - and they\u2019ve even had the seal of approval on many occasions by many players (and my cake obsessed other half).\n\nDid I mention they\u2019re vegan too? I\u2019m just out here ticking every box for you.\n\nHere are the recipes - tell me in the comments box below what you think.\n\nBurger:\n\n1 x tin of Cooked black beans (400g)\n\n75g of cooked brown rice\n\n1/2 onion finely diced\n\n1/2 tsp of Dijon mustard\n\nHandful of chopped parsley\n\nSea salt and black pepper\n\nSmoked paprika - 1/2 tsp\n\nThe first important note: please remember to cook the rice. It\u2019s not a shortcut. If you don't, it\u2019ll taste like dung and break your teeth. Raw rice will not taste nice.\n\nAfter the rice is cooked literally put it all in a good processor, whack it up high and blend till it comes together.\n\nThen form your burgers and set aside in the fridge. Healthy, simple and it still comes with that naughty attitude a filthy burger brings.\n\nAnd now for the brownie:\n\n5 tablespoons sunflower oil\n\n150g vegan dark chocolate\n\n170g self-raising flour\n\n3 big tsp of cocoa powder\n\n180g skevia or caster sugar - you choose\n\nSea salt\n\n1 tbsp vanilla essence\n\n230g soya milk\n\n(Image: chef_jonnymarsh /Instagram)\n\nGet a handful of nuts and dried fruit of your choice for topping - I go for dried cranberries and pistachios -they have a certain sex appeal about them that other nuts don\u2019t possess! Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re triple the price but maximum flavour!\n\nPlace the flour, cocoa powder and sugar/stevia in a bowl and mix.\n\nBreak the chocolate down into little cubes and place in a microwaveable bowl and heat gently until melted, or go old school and heat over a ban Marie until melted. That\u2019s an old French food term for cooking over water, I\u2019m not banning anyone called Marie from making this recipe.\n\nLeave the chocolate to cool on the side.\n\nAdd the soya milk, Olive oil and vanilla essence to the bowl and mix, it will start to thicken now.\n\nPour the chocolate in and give it one last injection of elbow grease, sprinkle your nuts and fruit on top and stick it in a greased tray and cook at 180\u00b0 for 22-25 mins.\n\nLeave to cool on a cooking wrack when cooked and then portion up and enjoy!", "description": "Top chef JONNY MARSH, who cooks for Premier League stars, returns with his latest column with two must-eat recipes", "authors": ["Jonny Marsh", "Image", "Chef_Jonnymarsh", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18877260.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jonny-Marsh-Meet-the-Michelin-star-chef-to-Manchester-City.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
