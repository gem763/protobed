But if you play for Man United, you have to accept it and expect it. Listen, it could have been worse \u2013 we could have lost 5-1 to Liverpool.\u201d\n\nPallister is reflecting on the day, 30 years ago, when United were humiliated 5-1 by Manchester City. You have to go back that far for the last time United started a season so badly and the Liverpool reference is pertinent given that it is the Premier League leaders who visit Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon, hoping and doubtless expecting to inflict more pain on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s struggling side.\n\nUnited, of course, would emerge from what Alex Ferguson \u2013 there was no knighthood then \u2013 would dub \u201cthe agony period\u201d to usher in a dynasty of success but, as Pallister reflects, it was hard to see the wood from the trees at times in that troubled 1989-90 season, when they mustered just eight points from their first eight games, one fewer than the current crop.", "description": "The passage of time has clouded some memories for Gary Pallister but not others.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000001337224-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_cocs2IiTVYg8jYnDvW-yBxc1xzqTvC-DpzxyWGKoDM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
