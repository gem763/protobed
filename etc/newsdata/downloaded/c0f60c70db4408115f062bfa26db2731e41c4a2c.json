There were no entrance tickets, no security guards, and no one had to check our vehicle. We drove all the way to the village centre, where a giant statue of Chairman Mao stood in the middle of a square, waving at me. Next to him were four portraits of his Communist comrades: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. The loudspeakers in the square repeatedly played the classic revolutionary song \u201cThe East Is Red\u201d; the same song that played in outer space in 1970 after China\u2019s first satellite was put into orbit.\n\nThe entire Nanjie village consists of dozens of factories and several main streets. Mao Zedong's face is everywhere. There were very few people or cars on the street while we were there, which may have been the reason why all the traffic lights in the village were not working, not even at the crossroads. I jumped up and down with my cameras in the middle of the road to get good angles, something that could easily get me killed if I were in a different town. But luckily the people of Nanjie seemed to move at a slow pace and be pleasant.\n\nThe next morning, a worker approached me on the street and said: \u201cWelcome to Nanjie Village!\u201d I was deeply flattered, because it is difficult to have a casual conversation in China with a complete stranger and I was dying to talk to local residents. I wanted to know how they felt about everything in the village, how they felt about their lives. So I asked my questions to the middle-aged worker, Mr. Wang.\n\nHis answer was only one word: \u201cZhong\u201d, a word in the Henan dialect that means \u201cwonderful.\u201d He went on to explain that many of life\u2019s necessities were free in the village, including housing, health care, education and food. He said this made people living in other places feel embarrassed, because even Chinese white-collar workers have to spend most of their salary on mortgage and credit card payments, while praying to God they never get sick.\n\nI asked him why other places in China couldn\u2019t replicate what Nanjie has, even though all of China is under the same social system? Why, in other places, would a person take advantage of others just to get more money? He replied that it was because of people\u2019s selfishness. He believed that selfishness was the root of all sorts of destruction. However, in Nanjie, people were doing the very opposite of being selfish \u2013 they were sharing. Selfish people would be isolated in this place, he said.\n\nAt the end of our chat, I asked whether he had ever been to a capitalist country. He said he had been to Japan. \u201cJapan\u2019s social system is also good (comparing it to Nanjie\u2019s), and it is also more modernised, especially in education,\u201d he told me.\n\nAs I bid farewell to Mr. Wang, he gave me a handbook titled \u201cUnderstanding Nanjie Village.\u201d Browsing through the pages, I saw many grandiose mottos recited by the village Communist Party Secretary (head of the village) Wang Hongbin. \u201cMoney is poison in an individual\u2019s hand, but fortune in a collective\u2019s hand,\u201d said one. \u201cMake the people in Nanjie village so rich that they don\u2019t have any deposit,\u201d said another.\n\nI have to admit, even though the actual workings of the society still puzzle me, I was intrigued by the lifestyle in Nanjie. I wanted to stay longer, but soon realised that it was the end of month and I still had a bunch of credit card bills to pay. I snapped back to reality.", "description": "The figure of Chairman Mao Zedong looms large, both literally and metaphorically, in Nanjie village.
