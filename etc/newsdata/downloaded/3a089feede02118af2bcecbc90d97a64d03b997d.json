Really ugh.\"\n\nShe captioned the video: \"Apologies!!! This post should be about being excited to meet my @dancingonice #iceskating pro later today, but..... Ugh! My back! Agony!\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n\"Not much sleep for 2nd night after my flight from #nyc Result? I\u2019m feeling really low to think of the dramas I\u2019ve been through to finally find (*last-minute!) accommodation and end up with a bed with a mattress-from-hell for the next freakin\u2019 six weeks training here in the UK!\n\n\"Watch out! You can book and pay for accommodation on a website, only to discover that the place advertised as being available for the dates you need, actually isn\u2019t!\n\n\"Cue nightmare scenarios of wrangling refunds, and trying to find somewhere else, without repeating the cycle..\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nTrisha said the mattress was like a marshmallow.\n\nThe talk show legend also apologised to her fellow contestant Ian 'H' Watkins, after she'd made fun of him she taking his own pillows with him wherever he goes.\n\nFellow star Caprice Bourret offered to step in and give her somewhere to stay, but thankfully, the owner of Trisha's rented accommodation got in touch and offered to sort it out.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
