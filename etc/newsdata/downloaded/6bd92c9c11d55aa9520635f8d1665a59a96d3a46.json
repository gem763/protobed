[It would] also help if he tackled climate change which is making hurricanes more destructive! Instead, he will remove limits on methane! Get a grip!\u201d\n\nHer stint as prime minister lasted roughly five months in the early 1990s after the resignation of Brian Mulroney in 1993, faced backlash for the tweet, many calling it \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nThe storm is expected to make landfall on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to impact the entirety of Florida, and residents need to be prepared,\u201d Acting FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor told CNN on Friday. \u201cSo, take the time now \u2026 to understand what your local risk is.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Ms. Campbell backtracked from her \u201cget a grip\u201d response to critics and issued the followed apology on Friday: \u201cI have deleted my tweet about the hurricane & Mar a Lago and sincerely apologize to all it offended. It was intended as sarcasm-not a serious wish of harm. Throwaway lines get a life of their own on Twitter. I shd know better. Mea culpa.\u201d\n\nAs there are in Puerto Rico- sorry you don\u2019t get snark- but Trump\u2019s indifference to suffering is intolerable! Wd also help if he tackled climate change which is making hurricanes more destructive! Instead, he will remove limits on methane! Get a grip! \u2014 Kim Campbell (@AKimCampbell) August 29, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
