There is a retrial scheduled to start Oct. 24 on eight of the charges that hung the jury in the first trial. (Photo: John Gibbins, AP)\n\n\u201cThe convictions must be reversed,\u201d one of Winslow\u2019s new defense attorneys wrote to the court on Sept. 25.\n\nHis attorneys are asking the court to erase those findings of guilt, arguing Winslow should get a whole new trial on all charges because he was denied due process in the first trial.\n\nThat request is a longshot for Winslow, 36, who has been incarcerated here since March after once living the high life with $40 million in career earnings as an NFL tight end. Even if that request is denied as expected, he still will head to a retrial Oct. 24 on eight of the charges that hung the jury in his first trial.\n\nMORE WINSLOW: How Kellen Winslow II went from NFL star to accused serial rapist\n\nA new jury will be seated for that proceeding, where he again will face charges of raping a hitchhiker, sodomizing a homeless woman, raping an unconscious woman in 2003 and abusing a 77-year-old woman at a local gym in February.\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019ll be a remake of the first trial, where Winslow\u2019s father, a Pro Football Hall of Famer, was among those who showed up every day and heard a brutal display of graphic evidence against his namesake son.\n\nThe retrial will include much of the same evidence as in the first trial, but this time the prosecution will try to get the new jury to deliver unanimous verdicts on the remaining eight charges, which is required for conviction under California law. In the first trial, the jury deadlocked by a 10-2 margin in favor of Winslow\u2019s guilt on four of the eight counts, by a 7-5 margin on three others and 8-4 on one.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t bode well for Winslow in a retrial. Additional convictions could put him behind bars for life.\n\n\u201cAs every defense attorney across the nation knows, a retrial usually does not end up in the defense\u2019s favor,\u201d said M. Dod Ghassemkhani, a San Diego criminal defense attorney who is not involved in the Winslow case. \u201cThe reason is the (prosecutor) always learns from the mistakes they made in the first trial as to why it hung on certain counts.\u201d\n\nThe same jury in June convicted Winslow of three crimes: forcible rape of a homeless woman, misdemeanor indecent exposure with another woman, plus misdemeanor lewd conduct with the woman at the gym in February, all ages 58 or older. He hasn\u2019t yet been sentenced for those convictions but faces nine years in prison for them \u2013 which his attorneys will attempt to have overturned before the start of the retrial.\n\nThey argue that the first trial unfairly included all five alleged victims \u2013 three who alleged rape, one who alleged misdemeanor indecent exposure and one who alleged misdemeanor lewd conduct. His attorneys say that the misdemeanor cases should not have been joined with the rape cases, but because they were, they were unfairly used to influence his rape conviction at the first trial after San Diego County prosecutor Dan Owens painted Winslow as a sexual deviant.\n\n\u201cHad the jurors not been inundated with claims that defendant was 'wired' to be a 'pervert' or 'deviant,' it is probable that jurors (at least one) would not have voted to convict,\u201d Winslow\u2019s attorney Patrick Morgan Ford wrote the court Sept. 25.\n\nWinslow\u2019s attorneys made a similar request before the first trial, asking for separate trials instead one trial with five alleged victims. That request was denied by Superior Court Judge Blaine K. Bowman, who also will hear this request to reverse the convictions shortly before the retrial Oct. 24.\n\nGhassemkhani told USA TODAY Sports that the request to reverse the convictions has \u201cno chance\u201d because Bowman isn\u2019t going to overrule his previous decision.\n\nOwens, who prosecuted the first trial, argued that Judge Bowman properly allowed the jury to consider the misdemeanor indecent exposure case as evidence of Winslow\u2019s propensity to commit other sexual offenses. In that misdemeanor case, the jury in June convicted him of pulling his pants down and exposing himself to a woman who lived down the street from the Winslow home that was sold in August.\n\n\u201cThe People in this case vigorously but appropriately argued the evidence showed (Winslow) to be a sexual predator who continuously engaged in both violent and impulsive sexual offenses, and the elements of each individual offense were supported by the evidence,\u201d Owens wrote the court in response to Winslow\u2019s motion for a new trial.\n\nIn his first trial, Winslow\u2019s attorneys tried to raise reasonable doubt with the jury about his guilt by stressing inconsistencies in witness testimony and the lack of physical evidence in each case. Winslow\u2019s attorney, Brian Watkins, also said in his opening statement at the first trial that Winslow cheated on his wife \u201cnumerous times\u201d and had consensual sex with the hitchhiker but didn\u2019t rape her or others.\n\nWinslow married his wife Janelle in June 2006, but the couple separated Dec. 20, after most of the allegations came out, according to court documents. She cited irreconcilable differences with him in her divorce petition.\n\nSince his conviction in June, Winslow also his shuffled his defense team. Watkins is no longer on the case because of a scheduling conflict. Attorney Marc Carlos will continue to represent Winslow at the retrial, along with a new attorney, Gretchen von Helms.\n\nCarlos and Owens didn\u2019t immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nFollow reporter Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.
