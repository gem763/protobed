John Lewis and Gov. Brian Kemp. Just last month, he signed the \u2060Georgia governor's press conference on Hurricane Dorian at GEMA.\n\nLocal hero: Cowan, who is deaf himself, has been an interpreter at Atlanta Pride since 2000\n\nAmazing: The clip, which was filmed by Jeremy Turner of Team Turner Real Estate, shows him translating Beyonc\u00e9's lyrics while energetically moving to the music\n\nGoing viral: The footage of Cowan has scored him plenty of fans, though he is already a prominent star in the Atlanta deaf community\n\nAccording to Project Q Atlanta, he's interpreted at Black Lives Matter protests, anti-Trump protests, the Women\u2019s March, and a Pulse nightclub shooting vigil at the Center for Civil & Human Rights over the years.\n\nThe video DiMarco shared has been viewed more than 2.3 million times on Twitter, with many people praising Cowan \u2060\u2014 and his saucy dance moves \u2060\u2014 in the comments.\n\n'This transcends language,' one person wrote, while another added: 'I have no idea what he's saying, yet it still sends a message.'\n\nEven Cowan himself responded, writing: 'Thank you, @NyleDiMarco for posting this.... That crazy guy is me!'\n\nStart of it all: Dancing With the Stars winner Nyle DiMarco shared a video of the moment on Twitter, and fans were quick to identify Cowan in the comments while praising him\n\nSuccess: The video quickly went viral on Twitter, with Nyle's followers, and some of David's friends, going wild over the clip\n\nGrateful: David responded to Nyle to thank him for sharing the video with the world\n\n'There were several different songs at the event,' he added. 'I believe this particular song in that video is \"Get Me Bodied\" by Beyonce.'\n\nSpeaking with Time, Cowan broke down the process of signing in real-time at the Atlanta Pride event.\n\n'We have a hearing interpreter who listens to the songs and relays to me. Then I translate into ASL,' he said, though he noted that some lyrics such as 'slap my booty' are complicated to translate because of the use of slang words.\n\nBut those difficulties are actually what make his interpretations so appealing.\n\n'That crazy guy is me!' Cowan, who is pictured with DiMarco, thanked him for sharing the clip with followers\n\nIn demand: Cowan is also an ASL interpreter for politicians in the state, including Rep. John Lewis and Gov. Brian Kemp\n\nHis life's work: The interpreter said his passion is creating a space where there's no language deprivation\n\n'I can\u2019t just fingerspell that because of our language/culture aspect,' he explained. 'I had to dance with my hand [and] slap on my butt.'\n\nCowan, who said he enjoys any music with bass or treble, is happy the video has brought attention to the importance of the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a law that prohibits discrimination based on disability in the public sphere.\n\n'What I enjoy the most about interpreting is to allow the language accessible to the deaf audiences. It\u2019s my passion,' he said.\n\n'[Creating] a space where there\u2019s no language deprivation. It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about the deaf audiences.'", "description": "Deaf model Nyle DiMarco shared a video of American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter David Cowan translating the song at Atlanta Pride last week.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/01/19908642-0-image-a-87_1571444937542.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
