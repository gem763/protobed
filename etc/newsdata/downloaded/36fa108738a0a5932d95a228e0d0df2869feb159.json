Following reports that he and Gigi still text on the regular, Tyler set things straight and opened up about why they actually broke up.\n\nTalking with People TV, Tyler said the best part of their relationship was \"just meeting someone that was great.\" He also added that even though they're over, he still has a ton of respect for her and thinks highly of her.\n\nWhen the host asked him to reflect on his time with Gigi, he said he's not totally sure what he learned from those eventful two months together and is still processing everything. He said, \"What I learned about myself through that experience? I don't know.\" Very insightful stuff right here.\n\nHe went on to explain the mature reason they broke up and what it's been like living in the spotlight. He told the host:\n\n\"I took it as I met a great person, a great friend. It wasn't like a bad breakup or anything like that. It was just, we're at different parts of our lives right now. What did I learn about myself? I don't know. I'm still learning so much about myself every day. Being in this light is totally different, so I'm still learning.\"\n\nAs you can tell, there are no hard feelings, but they definitely don't text all the time anymore. According to him, they see each other when they see each other and it's always cordial. Cool, cool, cool...\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"What I learned about myself through that experience?
