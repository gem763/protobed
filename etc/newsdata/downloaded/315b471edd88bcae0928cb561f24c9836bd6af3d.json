International Labour Organization (ILO) on the application of work standards.\n\nThe ILO last year said 93% of those who worked in the 2018 Uzbek cotton harvest did so voluntarily, and the systematic recruitment of students, teachers, doctors and nurses had ended - although this was disputed by human rights groups such as UGF.\n\nIn response to a request for comment put to Britain's international trade department, a spokesman said the government \"does not generally comment on ongoing or potential litigation\".\n\nLast year Britain, which gives preferential tariffs to Uzbekistan, imported 360,000 pounds ($455,000) of Uzbek cotton, - 0.1% of its total cotton imports in 2018 - state data showed.\n\n\n\n\n\nUZBEK COTTON COMMITMENT\n\nThe annual cotton harvest in Uzbekistan is the world's largest recruitment operation, with about 2.6 million people temporarily picking cotton every year, according to the ILO.\n\nPrime Minister Abdulla Aripov, who has been opening up the country since taking office in 2016, has vowed to stop thousands of students, teachers and health workers from picking the harvest, a practice widely condemned as forced labour.\n\n\"The government of Uzbekistan remains fully committed to eradicating forced labour in the cotton harvest,\" Erkin Mukhitdinov, first deputy minister at the country's labour ministry, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via email.\n\n\"We have taken a number of steps including increased wages, improved working and living conditions, reduced areas allocated for cotton production,\" he said, without responding directly to a request for comment on the upcoming court proceedings.\n\nHowever, Berlin-based UGF last year said in a report that state-imposed forced labour was still \"systematic and massive\".\n\nUnder a 2012 EU regulation, Uzbek cotton imports receive a preferential tariff under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences, which seeks to facilitate trade with certain developing nations.", "description": "A landmark legal challenge will be filed in Britain on Monday over cotton imports from Uzbekistan in a case lawyers say could pave the way to stop slave-made goods entering the European Union (EU).
