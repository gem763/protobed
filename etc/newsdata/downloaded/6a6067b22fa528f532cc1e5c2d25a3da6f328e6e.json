But what about Rosie dropping her tart or Michael\u2019s mini breakdowns? Those were just the hor\u2019d\u2019oeurves, henny. Now we\u2019re getting to the whole meal, the meat of the competition.\n\nThis is all a direct consequence of last week\u2019s episode, when Paul and Prue finally kicked off two contestants \u2014 Helena and Michelle \u2014 narrowing the field of bakers to seven. That seems like a lot of people, but it\u2019s really not: Three of these seven people, or about 43 percent, will make it to the finale. A few of the bakers seems like shoe-ins, including Steph, David, and Michael, but there\u2019s also some dark horses: Disney princess Alice, sophisticated toddler Henry, and maybe even Rosie, our stoic kween? Now\u2019s the time to start that betting pool.\n\nAfter two weeks featuring brand-new themes, the GBBS producers decided to give us a break and return to a well-worn topic: Desserts Week. You may ask yourself: Isn\u2019t every week Desserts Week, and the answer is yes. But you just gotta roll with it. The judges kick off the week with a meringue cake Signature Challenge, in which the bakers are asked to create a tri-layer dessert made with lighter-than-air blocks of meringue and sandwiched together with a filling of their choosing. Prue points out that because the challenge is so simple, the bakers may be tempted to go overboard in an effort to impress the judges who always insist on being impressed.\n\nAlice and Steph decide to play it safe by creating meringue versions of well-known desserts, a Black Forest cake and an Eton Mess, respectively. Steph\u2019s features raspberries, white chocolate cream cheese, and caramelized pistachio spikes as well as pistachios in the cake, while Alice combines sweet cherries with chocolate meringue and mousse.\n\nThe rest of the bakers choose more abstract flavor combinations. David\u2019s Spiced Meringue features three separately spiced meringues \u2014 cinnamon, clove, and star anise \u2014 which Paul suspects might be too much, as do our collective nose hairs. David insists that they\u2019ll work with the blackberries and figs he\u2019s using in between.\n\nRosie, meanwhile, goes for a raspberry-lime meringue with \u2026 chocolate, a combination that doesn\u2019t exactly sound delicious, but, hey, she\u2019s trying. Michael joins the chocolate brigade with a classic combination: dark chocolate and orange plus orange liqueur, which sends a collective, orgasmic shiver through the mothers of Great Britain. Priya also decides to add a liquor to her meringue, opting for amaretto with almond dacquoise and blueberry creme au beurre. (\u201cBlue food is weird,\u201d she says later.) While she discusses all this with the judges, Paul mentions for the second time in as many weeks that though Priya\u2019s flavors are spot-on, she needs to work on her time management skills. Through a strained smile, Priya assures him that she will. Henry \u2014 who we should note is wearing Helena\u2019s spider web sheriff badge [sob emoji] \u2014 decides to add one more layer than the required three to his Towering Meringue with pistachio meringue, chocolate creme patissiere, raspberry jam, and chocolate work. In the background of all this, Michael prattles on and on about nuts to absolutely no reaction from the other bakers.\n\nWith such a simple premise, none of the bakers suffer any serious mishaps, though Rosie ends up having to make her ganache again after getting a grainy result the first time around. Priya finishes on time!\n\nJudging begins and David is up first, and as it turns out all that spice DOESN\u2019T work. The David who won mega praise last week for a simple vanilla custard screams from inside. On to Priya, who learns that blue food really isn\u2019t appealing. Prue says the ashy purple tinge of her bake looks \u201chorrible\u201d and not at all appetizing. Her meringue is also overbaked and heavy on the amaretto. Rosie\u2019s \u201cwonky\u201d meringue tastes great, but the judges find the layer of chocolate ganache on top to be too thick and out of place. Alice has the opposite problem: Her meringue with an edible handle is lovely, but the judges have a hard time picking up the cherry flavor in her gateau dupe even though it\u2019s the exact shade of Dead Joffrey\u2019s face.\n\nMichael, meanwhile, makes the unusual choice of hiding his meringue under a chocolate shell, which has the effect of making his meringue sweat and soften. But his simple flavors, which actually come through in all their orange-chocolate glory, impress Prue and moms everywhere. Steph immediately shows up Michael with her frosted Eton Mess meringue, and Paul and Prue find themselves searching for any way to criticize it. \u201cToo many nuts,\u201d Prue says, which is patently impossible. Henry also passes with flying colors, though his four meringues look pretty janky, but tastes great. So great, in fact, that Paul accuses Henry. This late in the season, Paul?! Absolutely not.\n\nFor the third week in a row, Prue sets the Technical Challenge, raising the question: Does Paul even contribute anything to show anymore other than Hollywood Handshakes and Icy Blue Stares\u2122? Prue wants the bakers to make six verrines, or glasses, filled with mango compote, coconut panna cotta, raspberry jelly, coconut and lime streusel, and topped with a sabl\u00e9 biscuit. Alice, the poster child for study abroad programs everywhere, says that sabl\u00e9 is French for sand.\n\nBehind-the-scenes, Prue says she\u2019s looking for straight, even layers, precise measurements, and that the bakers must chill each layer before adding the next. Henry immediately ignores the advice about measurements while Steph and Rosie admit that they\u2019ve never made a panna cotta before. Did you know \u201cpanna cotta\u201d means \u201ccooked cream?\u201d Two can play at that game, Alice! Speaking of panna cotta, Priya fails to cool hers for long enough, so her raspberry jam drops right through the panna cotta, a bad look. As the bakers bring their verrines to the judging table they walk like a slow-moving pod of whales to keep their sabl\u00e9s from toppling into their glasses.\n\nFor the first time in two weeks, all the Technical bakes immediately pass the eye test, with none of them looking too tragic. Priya, Rosie, and Michael get dinged for the fruit parts of their verrines not being totally set. Steph\u2019s sable is overbaked, though everything beneath it is perfect, and Henry\u2019s sable is too thick and his layers are wavy. (This. Is. Why. We. Measure.) David and Alice both get perfect marks.\n\nPriya, Michael, and Rosie come in 7th, 6th, and 5th place, which are no longer respectable standings now that we\u2019re down to just seven bakers. Steph takes 3rd, David takes 2nd, and Alice, queen of Biscuits Week, takes 1st place. David, meanwhile, dies a little inside: This is the FOURTH time he\u2019s gotten second place in the Technical and he\u2019s still never been crowned Star Baker. Always the bridesmaid \u2026\n\nDay two arrives and it\u2019s Michael\u2019s birthday. Sandi asks Michael how old he is now. \u201c26!\u201d he says to which Sandi says, \u201cFantastic age,\u201d in a tone that is in no way convincing. It\u2019s all downhill from here, Michael.\n\nThe judges have asked the bakers to make celebratory bombes, the best example of which is a Baked Alaska. But none of the bakers would be stupid enough to include frozen elements, right? Wrong. David has decided to add a lemon and shiso leaf sorbet to his bombe because he is thirsty for Star Baker-ship. At Michael\u2019s station, the Black Forest gateau theme comes roaring back in the form of a bombe with cherry jelly, chocolate and almond mousse, and cherry cheesecake. After her somewhat successful Black Gateau meringue cake, Alice decides to make a tiramisu bombe with loads of espresso and spiced rum.\n\nPriya and Rosie, who are in a race to the bottom, both go for tropical flavors: Priya with a Summer Fruit Bombe with chocolate mousse and Rosie with Ruby Bombe featuring honey cake, mango, lemon, hibiscus, and salted white chocolate. It\u2019s \u2026 a lot. Steph and Henry both go for much warmer flavors in the form of a cinnamon, apple, and honey bombe for Henry and a mirror-glazed bombe with coffee bavarois and light and airy jaconde sponge soaked with amaretto for Steph. Somewhere, Priya\u2019s husband smiles.\n\nThen the real fun begins: As with any challenge involving molds \u2014 bombes are built in bowls, frozen, and then turned out \u2014 a lot can go very wrong, very fast. And while nothing goes wrong for anyone, tell me your heart didn\u2019t start racing when some of the bakers, and especially Alice, couldn\u2019t get their bombes out. Don\u2019t lie, it\u2019s exciting! This is the baking drama we crave!\n\nEven better, the lack of disasters means all the judging will actually come down to presentation and flavor, with no excuses for a missing chunk of cake or whatever. Steph goes first and despite her telling the judges that the mirror glaze wouldn\u2019t work out, it totally works out and the judges have nothing but good things to say, which totally overwhelms Steph. Listen to some Lizzo, Steph. Get yo\u2019self some confidence! Next Rosie presents her stunningly red Ruby Bombe, and despite it looking good the judges find it lacking, calling it \u201cclumsy.\u201d Next, David impresses Prue with his lemony sorbet, but neither judge can really taste the grassy shiso leaf and David\u2019s jello is rubbery. For the second time this season, Paul employs his \u201cso rubbery that if I dropped it, it would bounce back and hit me in the face\u201d dad joke. The man really is phoning it in these days.\n\nMichael manages to pull off his Black Forest Gateau bombe, but he gets dinged for a runny cheesecake and the bombe\u2019s \u201cgaudy\u201d decoration. When Alice presents her tiramisu bombe, the judges are immediately taken with its appearance, which includes a dusting of cocoa. In all, Paul and Prue use the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d four times. Like Steph, Alice is in disbelief that she did a good job and walks back to her station in a catatonic state.\n\nPriya and Henry are the last two to receive their judgements, and while Priya gets some praise for her summer fruit bombe\u2019s decoration and the beautifully baked sponge, the judges complain that the chocolate mousse is too sweet and the raspberry mousse isn\u2019t sweet enough. Sure. But it\u2019s Henry who receives the most damning criticism of the evening. Not only is his bombe bland with the apple and honey masked by cinnamon, but his cake is \u2026 stodgy. Henry hangs his head like a no-longer-sophisticated toddler.\n\nAfter making a show of deliberating, Noel and Sandi announce that Steph is Star Baker for the third week in a row. Alice came so close! Then they announce who\u2019s leaving: Priya. Unlike last week\u2019s double elimination, no one seems surprised by Priya\u2019s departure. She was always baking on borrowed time and the judges seemed to have decided that Priya was on her way out from the start of the episode.\n\nIn her post-elimination interview, Priya finally delivers a little substance (and style), saying that she left her job the year before and felt a bit lost. So she decided to do what she liked to do and bake, which brought her to GBBS. The lesson: \u201cIf you just start with the things that you really enjoy, you can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d No need for a quippy conclusion. That is some solid, wonderful advice.", "description": "As with any challenge involving molds, a lot can go wrong, and fast. This is the baking drama we crave!
