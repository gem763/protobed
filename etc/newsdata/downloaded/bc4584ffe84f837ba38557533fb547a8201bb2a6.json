The Juarez cartel was allied with Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman\u2019s Sinaloa cartel until 2004 but the two became rivals again after El Chapo order the murder of Carrillo Fuentes\u2019 other brother Rodolfo.\n\nIn return, Carrillo Fuentes ordered the killing of El Chapo\u2019s brother, sparking a bloody war between the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels which cost at least 8,000 lives. The two gangs had shared investments in drug shipments, transportation infrastructure and contacts with corrupt government officials.\n\nBased in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Carrillo Fuentes\u2019 cartel fought for control of trafficking routes in an area through which up to 70 percent of the cocaine entering the U.S. passes.\n\nWHERE DOES MEXICO REALLY GET ITS GUNS?\n\nCarillo Fuentes has sat in a Mexican prison since he was captured at a traffic checkpoint in October 2014.
