After having tried to guess where the president might land on a given policy dispute only to see him derail their plans, this time, they\u2019re taking no chances of reliving the trauma.\n\n\u201cFirst time ever in history when the president sets the agenda every day when he tweets at 4 in the morning,\u201d said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who is retiring at the end of the year and saw his work on an immigration bill fall apart last year after Trump came out against it. \u201cPelosi will drive some trains, Mitch will drive others. And the president is going to drive ones he wants to drive.\u201d\n\nThe dynamic is a reflection not just of Trump\u2019s mercurial nature but of how sensitive the issue of gun control is. Republican senators are loath to get crosswise with conservative activists if they don\u2019t have cover from the president on proposals many have previously rejected. Even some Democrats acknowledge that if they really want to see something passed, Trump is going to have to make the first move.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
