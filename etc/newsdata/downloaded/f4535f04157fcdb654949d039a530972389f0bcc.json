Deptford Market is such an inspiration \u2013 you have to rummage through everything but it\u2019s really fun! I have an obsession with really chunky shoes like these ones which are from Dansko. I usually buy secondhand but sometimes I save up and buy something really nice. On Frieze: I\u2019ve been to Frieze before and I love it. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult because there\u2019s so much to see, but I think my favourite this year is Dana Mahnke\u2019s work.\n\nPhotograph: Anselm Ebulue/The Guardian", "description": "The culture crowd brings plenty of personality to their clothes, which on the first day of this year\u2019s fair meant \u00a31 trousers from Deptford Market, special edition Issey Miyake and an all-yellow ensemble", "authors": ["Photograph", "Anselm Ebulue The Guardian", "Interviews Peter Bevan", "Photographs Anselm Ebulue"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07b367a374ab30737d0ae1c35b61beba4cce0a5d/0_1310_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f2f6127998324f9f3856be23a969db49", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
