But he, to his credit, has gone to the opposite extreme by making himself more accessible to the press than any other major presidential candidate since John McCain in 2000.\n\nLast week, Buttigieg embarked on a four-day Iowa bus tour with an important twist\u2014virtually everything that the Indiana mayor said to reporters en route would be on-the-record. The trip was a conscious echo of McCain\u2019s \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d which propelled the then-Arizona maverick to victory in the 2000 New Hampshire primary. On the bus last week, I was the only journalist who had also covered the McCain campaign, and I can testify that the South Bend mayor lived up to that laudable tradition for openness as he cheerfully answered questions, large and small, from a press contingent that topped out at 15 reporters.\n\nSitting in a swivel chair in the middle of a rock-star bus that had carried the likes of Justin Timberlake and Gloria Estefan, Buttigieg displayed flashes of the agile mind that has made him a favorite, along with Warren, among the high-SAT-score wing of the Democratic electorate. At the same time, he was working to differentiate himself from the rest of the field, on issues from guns, to health care, to paper straws, displaying a keen sense of nuance and a willingness to challenge party orthodoxy on nuclear power.\n\nOn the road from Boone to Webster, Buttigieg described how his opinion on guns changed after he was first deployed to Afghanistan in 2014. \u201cEarly on, there\u2019s a sense of toughness that goes with having a gun,\u201d he said. But, \u201con a few occasions, when I felt it was necessary to have my pistol under my pillow, I realized that having a gun made me feel smaller\u2014rather than bigger\u2014because of this idea that I needed it.\u201d\n\nIn his stump speech, Buttigieg often warns his fellow Democrats, \u201cWe can\u2019t water down our values. But we also can\u2019t get so caught up in purity tests that we shut out half the country before we get to November.\u201d\n\nAboard the bus, Buttigieg replied to a question I had asked by outlining some of the \u201cpurity tests\u201d in the current Democratic race that trouble him. He began, as expected, by restating his opposition to the proposed elimination of any role for private health insurance in the Medicare for All plans ballyhooed by Sanders and Warren. But the next purity test he listed was surprising: the calls to outlaw plastic straws. \u201cAnybody who thinks we ought to ban plastic straws should first have a conversation about disability,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cPlastic straws are actually important for a lot of people. But that\u2019s way to the side. I just think we need to have a level of focus on what\u2019s most important in dealing with the planet.\u201d\n\n\n\nButtigieg went on to challenge the absolutism on nuclear power that animates many Democrats. (\u201cAt least in the short term, I don\u2019t think we need to build new nuclear. I think that waste storage and disposal are a real issue.... But I don\u2019t think we can afford to be dogmatic.\u201d)\n\nOf course, on some points, he simply refused to engage, dismissing, for instance, a question about why he chose to work for the famously arrogant management consulting firm, McKinsey & Company, by saying \u201cit\u2019s not something that I think is central in my story.\u201d But some details were more revealing. The candidate claims to iron his own white shirts (he owns more than a dozen), a skill that his mother taught him when he was about 10 years old. (Needless to say, as a veteran of many campaigns, I cannot imagine Bill Clinton ironing his own shirts.)\n\nNo Democratic presidential nominee since Alton Parker\u2014a New York state judge who was the party\u2019s pick to challenge Theodore Roosevelt in 1904\u2014has boasted as light a political resume as Buttigieg\u2019s. Several times, I struggled to find a polite way to ask Buttigieg if he really felt ready to move from mayor of South Bend to Leader of the Free World.\n\nAt one point in our rolling conversation, I noted that in 1960, Democratic elders like Eleanor Roosevelt opposed John Kennedy in part because they felt that at 43, he was too callow and inexperienced to be president. At the time, JFK had spent nearly 14 years in Congress.\n\nButtigieg responded by rattling off world leaders who are roughly his generational contemporaries from French President Emmanuel Macron (now 41) to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden (39 years old). \u201cSo there\u2019s a generational shift happening among countries around the world,\u201d the 37-year-old mayor said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that you expect the United States to be leading on. This time we\u2019re kind of catching up.\u201d\n\nThe answer seemed a little too glib and practiced for my taste. So I tried again when I sat down with Buttigieg for an interview the next morning in a corner of a hotel lobby in Waterloo. This time I quoted from memory Harry Truman\u2019s words on becoming president after FDR\u2019s death in 1945: \u201cI felt like the moon, the stars and all the planets had fallen on me.\u201d\n\nChoosing his words carefully and speaking more slowly than usual, Buttigieg\u2014who is less than half the age of Biden and Sanders\u2014said, \u201cI think any sane person has to be aware of the daunting nature of the office. There is no function on earth that is comparable. At the same time, every person who\u2019s done the job has been \u2026 at different stages of their lives. I think there is a lot to be said for experience. And that my experience is certainly as relevant as any experience that I could have in a legislative job in Washington.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, I circled back to the experience question by asking Buttigieg what he wished that he had time to learn before embarking on this quest for the Oval Office; in 1994, for example, as president, with a genocidal war raging in Bosnia, Bill Clinton had lamented that he wished he had known more about the Balkans.\n\nOnce again, Buttigieg\u2019s answer was unexpected. \u201cOne skill that I\u2019ve developed which will need to be at a whole different level is the art of knowing what not to concern yourself with,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause up to a certain point, you can convince yourself that if you stay up an hour later, or move a little quicker, you can touch everything that deserves to be touched. Even as mayor, I\u2019ve learned that\u2019s not true. And, as president, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s on a completely different level\u2014incredibly important, consequential, and demanding. Urgent priorities need to be ignored because there are others that even more so. And the art of that you can only learn by doing.\u201d\n\nMayor Pete, as he prefers to be known on the campaign trail, left me wondering if maybe I have been too rigid in inventing imaginary criteria to identify successful would-be presidents. Maybe talent and temperament are enough. Maybe that old E.F. Hutton commercial holds the only relevant clue that Pete Buttigieg is indeed ready to be president in 2021: When he speaks, people listen.", "description": "The mayor of South Bend knows how to enchant an audience.
