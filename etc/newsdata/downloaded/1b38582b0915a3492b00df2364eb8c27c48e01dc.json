But a new study reveals that it\u2019s very much alive, and capable of generating the kind of 6.4-magnitude earthquakes that could cause serious damage in such a populous area.\n\nThe devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake was also caused by a blind-thrust fault, which are not visible from the surface, and registered a 6.7, within the range of what researchers estimate the Wilmington blind\u2010thrust fault could generate on its own.\n\nThe fault is about 12 miles in length and runs diagonally northwest to southeast across the southwestern Los Angeles Basin, though related segments to the north and south lengthen the span of it to about 34 miles. It runs beneath the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, both of which are vital shipping centers for the state and the country.\n\n\n\nThe Wilmington blind-thrust fault's path through the Los Angeles Basin, shown in red. Research by Harvard University and the U.S. Geological Survey shows that the fault, thought to be dormant, is actually active. (Franklin Wolfe/Harvard University)\n\nBut the authors of the study, which was published last month in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, say that the fact that its activity wasn\u2019t discovered sooner is really nobody\u2019s fault.\n\n[California had its largest earthquake in years \u2014 then an even bigger one hit]\n\nThe Wilmington fault is moving more slowly than others in the region, which made it harder to detect its movements, said Franklin Wolfe, a doctoral fellow at Harvard University who led the study.\n\nThe formation\u2019s existence had been known since the 1930s, thanks to its presence near Southern California\u2019s immense Wilmington Oil Field. The oil industry had extensively studied the deepest and most ancient layers of rock, which showed folding indicative of a dormant fault line, Wolfe explained. But they hadn\u2019t looked at the younger, uppermost layers, which didn\u2019t contain precious oil but turned out to bear subtle signs of seismic activity.\n\nThe first hints that something might be going on began almost two decades ago, when another one of the study\u2019s authors, Daniel Ponti of the U.S. Geological Survey, began researching those layers as part of a water study in the area.\n\nPonti and his team noticed that the upper layers of rock bore the same telltale folds as the deeper ones below, which had been molded by earthquakes on the Wilmington blind\u2010thrust fault millions of years ago, indicating that the fault had been active far more recently than previously thought. They first published their findings in 2007 but needed more research to know what the folds meant.\n\nFor the new study, researchers at Harvard University and the USGS combined extensive data compiled by the oil industry of the deepest, oldest layers of rock in the area with new research from the USGS to create a comprehensive picture of the geology around the fault. After using 2-D and 3-D modeling technology, they were able to create a comprehensive picture of the fault and estimate its potential strength.\n\nThe good news, researchers say, is that the discovery of the Wilmington fault\u2019s activity doesn\u2019t necessarily increase the earthquake hazard level in the Los Angeles Basin.\n\nThe bad news: That\u2019s because there are already so many known active faults in Southern California and the state, and several of them are capable of producing damaging earthquakes.\n\nPonti and Wolfe say that further study of the fault is essential to determine whether it is connected to others in the region, as earthquakes on one fault can sometimes influence activity on another. But in the meantime, they say that the discovery shouldn\u2019t worry Los Angeles residents about earthquakes \u2014 more than usual, that is.\n\n\u201cIf you live pretty much anywhere in California, you\u2019re at earthquake risk,\u201d Ponti said. \u201cWe can refine that estimate a little better, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you need to be prepared for a major earthquake in your area.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWild horses will ride out Dorian like they have for centuries, with \u2018butts to the wind\u2019\n\nHer name is Chanel Miller, not \u2018unconscious intoxicated woman\u2019 in the Stanford assault case\n\nAmerican traveler who had a baby in her carry-on bag charged with human trafficking in the Philippines", "description": "A new study by the USGS and Harvard indicates that the fault has been active far more recently than we knew.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "September At Pm", "Kayla Epstein Is The Social Media Editor For National At The Washington Post.
