After it was disputed whether the injury had broken the bone, Adebowale was able to plead guilty to the lesser charge and avoid a trial.\n\nSasha Wass QC, defending, told the court Adebowale admitted hitting Mr Taplin when frustrated but did not break the bone.\n\nShe said: 'He accepted that he struck a blow, one blow, but he did not or he would not accept that he broke the jaw.'\n\nMs Wass added that Adebowale suffers from 'chronic paranoid schizophrenia' and was hearing voices telling him to attack Mr Taplin before the incident.\n\nShe said: 'He is clearly unwell, he clearly had a lapse in self control and he regained his self control and he immediately showed his remorse by writing a letter to Mr Taplin.\n\n'His medication was not sufficient to deal with the psychotic state he experienced on July 20 of last year and as a result of that state he administered the blow.'\n\nThe judge said in court today that Adebowale 'may in fact never leave Broadmoor' (file picture)\n\nMr Justice Jay said his sentencing decision will not significantly affect the 28-year-old's immediate future.\n\n'He has got another 39 or 40 years to go and may in fact never leave Broadmoor,' he said.\n\nPassing down the eight-month sentence, Mr Justice Jay said: 'There was a dispute between you and Mr Taplin. I have absolutely no doubt Mr Taplin was in the right and you were in the wrong.\n\n'What the CCTV clearly shows, that while Mr Taplin was in conversation, no doubt of work-related matters, you approached him from his left and on my interpretation of the evidence you delivered one hard blow.\n\n'It was a combination of the illness and the stress that was working on your mind that I feel was another factor in your case.'\n\nAdebolajo and Adebowale were bundled from the dock at the Old Bailey after they brawled with court officials as their sentencing hearing in February 2014 descended into violence\n\nMr Justice Jay accepted that Adebowale had heard voices before the attack.\n\n'The injury would have been very painful for a period of time, possibly a considerable period of time and I hope you sincerely regret that.'\n\nAfter serving his life sentence, Adebowale will serve half of the eight-month prison sentence before being released on licence.\n\nA further count of inflicting grievous bodily harm will lie on file.\n\nFollowing the sentencing, a Broadmoor spokesman told MailOnline: 'The safety of staff and patients at Broadmoor Hospital is paramount. When assaults on staff or other patients take place, we always report these to the police.'", "description": "Michael Adebowale, 28, who murdered Lee Rigby in 2013, pleaded guilty to punching a healthcare assistant while being held in the secure hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire, on July 20 last year.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/20285180-0-image-a-151_1572276331944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
