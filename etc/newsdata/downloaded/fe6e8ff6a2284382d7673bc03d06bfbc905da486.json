But its competitors argued that the process was unfair.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos\n\nOracle challenged the bidding process in federal court earlier this year, saying that it was rigged to favour Amazon, but a federal judge dismissed the allegation.\n\nWhat else does the Pentagon say?\n\nIt said that it had awarded more than $11bn in 10 separate cloud-computing contracts over the past two years.\n\nThe Jedi deal \"continues our strategy of a multi-vendor, multi-cloud environment as the department's needs are diverse and cannot be met by any single supplier,\" it added.\n\nMicrosoft has not yet issued a statement.", "description": "Microsoft is awarded the lucrative \"Jedi\" deal following a heavily-scrutinised bidding process.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/866B/production/_109411443_gettyimages-853699560.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
