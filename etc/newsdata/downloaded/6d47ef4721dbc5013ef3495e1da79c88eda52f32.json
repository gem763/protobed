We are continuing to improve technology across the NHS which will ultimately improve care for patients.\u2019\n\nOne MILLION people paid too much for NHS prescriptions last year More than a million people could have saved money on their prescriptions last year by buying a 'season ticket'. Research has found 1,042,098 people in England paid the full price for more than 12 prescriptions, spending more than the cost of a prescription prepayment certificate. A prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) is essentially a season pass which, for a one-off fee of \u00a3104, covers the cost of all prescriptions for a year. Patients without a PPC or an exemption for reasons such as pregnancy, a low income or a long-term illness have to pay the full \u00a39 for each prescription. An investigation by the personal finance website Money Saving Expert found more than a million people were wasting money paying the full price. 'These figures show that an increasing number of patients are paying more than they need to for medicine and other items prescribed on the NHS,' said Steve Nowottny, the site's news editor. 'And while in some cases that will be due to unexpected illness, in other cases there will be people who do expect to need 12 or more prescriptions who are simply overpaying unnecessarily.'\n\nElectronic prescriptions were introduced ten years ago and are already used by around 70 per cent of doctors surgeries in the UK.\n\nBut in November, the system will be rolled out nationally. The vast majority of GP practices will fully switch to the new system by the end of the year, with the final rollout complete by next summer.\n\nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u2018Implementing technology in the best interests of patient care by getting the basics right first is a key part of the College\u2019s future vision for general practice.\n\n'Electronic prescribing is an example of technology that works for GPs and our teams, our colleagues in pharmacies and our patients, and we are pleased to see the latest phase of the scheme being rolled out more widely.\u2019\n\nUnder the electronic prescribing system, patients can get their medication in two ways.\n\nThey can either nominate a pharmacy which will receive the details directly from their GP or they can receive a paper prescription with the digital barcode.\n\nThe medical information is held on a secure NHS database called NHS Spine and will allow a patient\u2019s prescription to be accessed quickly by GPs and pharmacies.\n\nDr Ian Lowry, Director of Digital Medicines and Pharmacy at NHS Digital, said: \u2018Every prescription that is sent electronically saves money for the NHS by increasing efficiency.\n\n\u2018The system is also safer and more secure, as prescriptions can\u2019t be lost and clinicians can check their status online. This is a huge milestone to reach, and one which benefits patients, GPs, pharmacists and the NHS as a whole.\u2019\n\nSimon Dukes, Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee Chief Executive, said: \u2018We are very pleased to see the Electronic Prescription Service rolling out nationally so that even more patients can take advantage of this digital NHS service.\n\n\u2018Pharmacies across England have been piloting electronic prescriptions for some time and they will benefit from the simpler and more secure processes that this final rollout will bring.
