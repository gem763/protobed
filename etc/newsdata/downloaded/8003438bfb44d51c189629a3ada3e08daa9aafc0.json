The place was in an absolute state. Lino floors caked in loose dog hair, suspicious smells, and even a stew left to fester in a slow cooker. A crack team of cleaners \u2014 my mum and dad \u2014 had made the journey up from Cornwall with what they considered to be essential cleaning materials: sprays, garden tools, a hoover and \u2026 a rubber-bristle broom. I was skeptical. Why would you bother bringing a broom up six hours in the car?\n\nIts superiority was soon obvious. I spent most of the day mumbling \u2018Huh! Amazing!\u2019 to myself as I conquered pile of filth after pile of filth. On a hard floor, the broom\u2019s rubber bristles pluck hold of anything in their way and, unlike microfibre mops, you\u2019re not left with the annoying task of shaking dust out of the fibres after you\u2019re done. On a carpet, the versatility of the rubber bristles means it pulls up animal hairs or crumbs with ease. The lightweight and chunky-yet-comfy handle doesn\u2019t leave your mitts in tatters if the task at hand is substantial, (as mine was). What\u2019s more, the broom\u2019s got little shoulder pads in the form of anti-mark bumpers, so you can go hell for leather at dirtier areas without the worry of scuffing up walls or skirting boards.\n\nIt\u2019s perfect for outside too, especially if you have decking \u2014 the firm bristles cut neatly through the teeth in the wood and dig up any deep-lying dirt. What\u2019s even better is, when switching between surfaces or from outdoor to indoor, you can simply pop it in the sink, give the brush head a quick scrub with some Fairy Liquid, and you\u2019re good to go again. That might sound like I\u2019ve gone a step too far with care and attention for a broom, but trust me, it\u2019s made me realise the traditional soft-sweeping brush I had before is a hub for bacteria and dirt.\n\nI had kindly planned to give my mum one less thing to travel home with and, well, steal the broom for myself. But my brother wanted to keep hold of it, which is probably the first tangible thing I can remember us fighting over. As soon as I arrived back in London, I popped into Wilko for some supplies and was greeted at the end of the first aisle by my new cleaning compadre \u2014 the exact lime-green one I\u2019d been using over the weekend. It was a sign, I thought. If you want this exact broom, you\u2019ll need to visit Wilko in-store, but the branded version (which JML calls \u2018WonderBroom\u2019) is on Amazon for a few pounds more. What\u2019s more, in the words of Alan Partridge, \u2018It\u2019s an extender!\u2019 and lengthens up to 1.2m long, so it can reach hard-to-get places but is easily twisted into a more compact form \u2014 perfect for places with limited storage, like my cosy flat.\n\nWilko Rubber Broom \u00a37 at Wilko Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
