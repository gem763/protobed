For others, it\u2019s a welcome solution to the alternative: hours of pushing while wondering how the heck a baby will fit through \u2018there\u2019.\n\n\n\nAfter months of being an incubator, the inevitable arrives: birth preparations. Other moms will start to ask how you\u2019re going to deliver. \u2018Will it be natural birth?\u2019 they\u2019ll say, as if testing you.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve had your heart set on natural birth, and women have applauded you for it as if it makes you stronger and more matronly, being told that you have to have a Caesar leaves you with mixed emotions: Will an op detract from the birth experience? Is it less womanly to have your baby plucked out through an incision?\n\nNatural birthers are very different from those who choose elective Caesareans. Women who choose the day on which their baby will be welcomed into the world are often looked down on, too. They are treated as though their decision is purely cosmetic, as if the new arrival\u2019s birthday is a matter of convenience for the mom.\n\nSome medical insurance plans won\u2019t cover an elective Caesar.\n\n\n\nNever mind that an elective Caesar may be done to reduce other risks during the birth process, and that the mother and baby will have great doctors around to help out, it does carry a stigma. If vaginal birth is described as natural, then that almost implies that a Caesar is unnatural.\n\nRead more: Right to Birth Movement launches in Cape Town\n\nEmergency Caesars are hard to adapt to: A few minutes before, you were looking forward to putting all those birthing classes into practice, when, shockingly; the birth is taken out of your hands. Not only that, but you\u2019ll be facing a longer recovery, and worrying that the scar won\u2019t heal, or that it will limit your ability to care for your baby.\n\nAnother anxiety could be the added burden to your finances for the costs of surgery, as well as whether or not you\u2019ll be able to have a natural birth with a second child after having had a Caesar.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to discuss all of the possibilities with your doctor beforehand. If you\u2019re a sworn natural birther, he can tell you the hows and whys of a Caesar, just in case.\n\nIn the same way, a mom who has opted for an elective Caesar should know what to do if she starts to go into labour before her date.\n\n\n\nPerhaps there isn\u2019t a \u2018better\u2019 way of becoming a mom, just different means to the same end.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the topic?\n\n\n\nShare your opinions with us, and we could publish your mail.
