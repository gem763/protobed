However, reports said both of the defendants who were alleged members of the Bang Gang/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones gang, were tried by separate juries after they accused the other of the murder.\n\nA Fox News report stated:\n\nProsecutors said that although Morgan did not wield the gun, he had the motive for murder. He allegedly targeted the 9-year-old because his father, Pierre Stokes, belongs to a rival gang \u2013 the Killa Ward faction of the Gangster Disciples \u2013 which Morgan blamed for an October 2015 shooting that killed his brother and injured his mother. Morgan\u2019s family also arranged the purchase of the gun that killed Lee, prosecutors added.\n\nReports said Lee was shot in the head with a .40-caliber handgun after the men lured him into an alleyway near a park on Chicago\u2019s South Side.\n\nProsecutors alleged that while Morgan may have had a motive for the killing, it was Boone-Doty who carried it out.\n\nIn 2016, a fellow inmate at the Cook County jail who was working for police as an informant recorded Boone-Doty confessing to the murder. He also said had no regrets about killing the child.\n\n\u201cNot only does he describe it in detail, he\u2019s proud of it in these recordings,\u201d Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Patrick Waller said of the recording, adding that \u201cHe does not ever offer one shred of remorse. \u2018It was worth it,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nOn the recording, the informant asks Boone-Doty, \u201cYou ain\u2019t never stepped back and thought, damn, I shouldn\u2019t have did that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t got that in my head, not even a little bit,\u201d Boone-Doty allegedly said. \u201cAin\u2019t no age. Period. Age 8 to 80. Eight days, eight seconds in this world, or 80 years, this is what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n\nBoone-Doty also described the murder in detail to the informant. \u201cI\u2019m looking at him. We walking. Bop. Hit the ground. Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop. I\u2019m laughing. I\u2019m looking\u2026 Bop bop bop bop bop man.\u201d\n\nWaller said the boy \u201csaw it coming\u201d as he recalled that Lee had wounds to his hands, an indication that he tried to protect himself from the gunshots.\n\n\u201cThe last thing he saw was this guy pulling out his gun and firing repeatedly, from close range, as he tried in vain to defend himself,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "Chicago gangbanger\u00a0Dwright Boone-Doty was found guilty of first-degree murder on Thursday in the 2015 death of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Dwright-Boone-Doty-murder-trial-AP-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
