She'll face a month in prison and a $20,000 fine.\n\nIn May Huffman pleaded guilty to paying college counselor William \u201cRick\u201d Singer $15,000 to alter her older daughter\u2019s SAT score in 2017. She apologized in an emotional statement.\n\n\"I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,\" Huffman said in a statement obtained by Fox News. \"I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.\" \"My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions,\" the statement continues, \"and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.\"\n\nBut her crime seems to pale in comparison to what \"Full House\" star Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli are accused of. They reportedly shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars to get their daughters into the University of Southern California. The parents, unlike Huffman, refuse to acknowledge any wrongdoing, rejected a plea deal and are determined to fight the charges in court. Their next scheduled hearing is October 2.\n\nFifteen other parents have pleaded guilty.", "description": "\"Desperate Housewives\" star Felicity Huffman became the first parent to .09/13/2019 14:12:43PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/260/72c2d654-a0df-4fc4-9eec-dd7feb68325c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
