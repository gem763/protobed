Check out maps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis nonsense has never happened to another President,\u201d he continued. \u201cFour days of corrupt reporting, still without an apology. But there are many things that the Fake News Media has not apologized to me for, like the Witch Hunt, or SpyGate! The LameStream Media and their Democrat partner should start playing it straight. It would be so much better for our Country!\u201d\n\nTrump has sent out at least 10 tweets on the matter since Sept. 2.\n\nThe latest missives came shortly after the now-Category 1 storm made landfall along Cape Hatteras, N.C., after lashing the Outer Banks. Dorian is being blamed for at least 30 deaths in the Bahamas, where it wreaked havoc as a Category 5 storm earlier this week.\n\nPresident Trump talks with reporters after receiving a briefing on Hurricane Dorian in the Oval Office on Wednesday. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) More\n\nThe controversy began during a hurricane briefing at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, when Trump mentioned Alabama as one of the states that could be affected by Dorian.\n\n\u201cI will say, the states \u2014 and it may get a little piece of a great place: It\u2019s called Alabama,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately. It\u2019s the size of \u2014 the storm that we\u2019re talking about. So, for Alabama, just please be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlabama to get a bit of a beat-down,\u201d the president told reporters on the South Lawn on Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut a forecast released by the National Weather Service more than an hour before Trump spoke showed the storm\u2019s projected path had already turned northward and posed no threat to Alabama. The weather service\u2019s Birmingham office quickly issued a correction.\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nTrump did not appreciate being corrected. In a tweet Monday night, the president bristled at the suggestion by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl that his forecast was wrong. (He also called Karl a \u201clightweight.\u201d)\n\nDuring another storm briefing in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump showed reporters an enlarged map displaying what he said was the initial forecast path of the storm. The map, which was displayed on a posterboard, appeared to have been altered with a marker, extending the storm\u2019s path to include Alabama.\n\nIn official photos of an Aug. 29 Oval Office FEMA briefing released by the White House, Trump views what appears to be an unaltered version of the map showing the storm affecting Florida and Georgia, but stopping short of Alabama.\n\nPresident Trump receives a briefing on Hurricane Dorian in the Oval Office on Aug. 29.
