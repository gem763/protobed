However, we found enough buyers underneath the turn things around and ended up forming a significant hammer. At this point, it\u2019s very likely that we could go towards the 0.68 level, which is the massive resistance above and essentially the \u201cceiling\u201d in the market. The 0.6833 level is the top of that resistance barrier, so I think signs of exhaustion probably are going to be jumped on. After all, the US dollar has been favored as we have a lot of concerns out there, and beyond that we also have concerns when it comes to global growth.\n\nAUD/USD Video 04.09.19\n\nWith the US/China trade relations souring even further, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a scenario where the Australian dollar strengthens, as things just aren\u2019t looking good. Ultimately, I believe that we continue to see a major \u201crisk off\u201d scenario, and therefore it\u2019s difficult to get excited about trying to buy \u201crisk on\u201d currency such as the Aussie. With that, I am looking to fade rallies going forward and of course a break down below the recent lows. At that point we will be targeting the 0.65 handle, which is a major support level on the longer-term charts, even going all the way up to the monthly timeframe. Ultimately though, I think it\u2019s too juicy of a target for the sellers to ignore.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The Australian dollar initially fell hard during the trading session on Tuesday as traders reacted to the RBA statement. After all though, we did rally quite significantly and ended up forming a bit of a hammer. We are at extreme lows, so that could be a bit of short covering going on as well.", "authors": ["Christopher Lewis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg"}
