Spangelo was hopeful she could repair her relationship with federal regulators. Now, a year later, that seems to have happened. The Federal Communications Commission fined Swarm $900,000, but also approved future launches. When Spangelo and I met in Washington, D.C., earlier this month, she had been in meetings with FCC officials, and was scheduled to meet with the agency\u2019s chairman, Ajit Pai, the following day.\n\nShe planned to show him the prototype, too, especially the gleaming loops at its edges, which matter far more than their decorative appearance suggests. \u201cThey are beautiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she said.\n\nNearly everything in orbit around Earth, whether it\u2019s a weather satellite or a bag of tools an astronaut accidentally let go of during a spacewalk, is monitored. A unit within the U.S. Air Force tracks about 23,000 artificial objects bigger than a softball in orbit, an environment that grows more crowded each year. The military warns satellite operators about potential collisions, which can be disastrous. The smaller an object is, the more difficult it is to spot in orbit\u2014and notify someone about before it\u2019s too late. This was the FCC\u2019s concern about Swarm\u2019s satellites, known as SpaceBEEs, for \u201cbasic electronic elements.\u201d Officials feared that the satellites, smaller than most miniature satellites already in orbit, couldn\u2019t be reliably tracked. When the FCC fined Swarm, the agency said the company had risked satellite collisions and threatened \u201ccritical commercial and government satellite operations.\u201d\n\nSwarm acknowledged its unlawfulness as part of the penalty. The twist is that the SpaceBEEs were eventually found to be trackable in orbit. Those elegant rings at their edges are radar reflectors, and Spangelo said they make each satellite appear 12 to 24 times larger than its actual size to both government and commercial tracking systems.\n\nRead: Private companies are building an exoskeleton around the Earth\n\nNeil Grace, an FCC spokesperson, said he was unable to confirm this assertion, and declined to comment on the agency\u2019s relationship with Swarm today. Spangelo said officials are supportive of her efforts now. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty optimistic person, so I always think if you apologize and you explain what happened, people are human and empathetic and they will understand,\u201d she said.\n\nThat explanation still remains fuzzy.\n\nSpangelo\u2019s story begins the same way it does for many people in her field, with childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut. After studying, aerospace engineering, she worked at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Google as a system engineer. She made it far enough in the selection process for astronauts in Canada, where is she from, that she was submerged into a pool inside a helicopter, flipped upside down, and instructed to escape as part of a test.", "description": "Two years after illegally launching tiny satellites into orbit, a start-up is trying to convince federal regulators it\u2019s going to play by the rules.", "authors": ["Marina Koren"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/iss040e016556_large/facebook.jpg?1569532688", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
