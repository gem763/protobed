Wow!\n\n\"We see ourselves as strategic partners to the management team of our companies, and sometimes we can help them pursue mergers and acquisitions where the industrial logic is so compelling.\"\n\nCaledonia also owns shares in Flutter. While the size of the stake is not known, Bloomberg records show it had about 1 million shares or 1.5 per cent of the company as August. If that's the case, it would emerge with about a 10 per cent stake in the combined company, should the deal pass muster with regulators globally and proceed as planned.\n\nThe manager pre-committed to vote its shares in favour of the transaction.\n\nThe friendly scrip deal put a rocket under both companies' share prices. The Stars Group was up 39.4 per cent last week, to be back to about where it was this time last year.\n\nIt was a timely boost as Caledonia had promised investors an update on Stars and its two other high conviction bets following a rough 12-months or so where the manager's three core holdings each had a year to forget. It meant Caledonia's flagship fund was down 20.2 per cent in the year to June.\n\nCaledonia told clients it would not panic and is sticking with its three big stockpicks.", "description": "Sydney-based Caledonia (Private) Investments is claiming some credit for a big global online gambling merger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6837%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_160%2C$y_46/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c2e23d56717a082f2b5a221d2d90397c6a036085", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
