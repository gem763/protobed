This is about the Washington Nationals and those guys in the clubhouse coming to Game 6 and playing lights out, knowing this could be it.\u201d\n\nReporters pushed him for more because while Martinez didn\u2019t want to talk about the play, everyone else could talk about nothing else. The play in question \u2014 which at the time seemed like it might change the series entirely \u2014 occurred as follows:\n\nAD\n\nWith the Nationals clinging to a 3-2 lead in the seventh inning, Turner hit a soft groundball in front of home plate. Astros pitcher Brad Peacock fielded it and hurried a throw. Turner, of course, is one of the fastest men in baseball.\n\nAD\n\nThe throw hit Turner as he hit first base, and it careened up the right field line, far enough for Turner to reach second and Yan Gomes to go from first to third. Suddenly, the Nationals had two runners in scoring position with no one out. Suddenly, they had a chance to build their lead.\n\nBut then, home plate umpire Sam Holbrook raised his arms. He motioned to Turner and held up a fist. He was out. Holbrook determined that Turner violated Rule 5.09 (a) (11) of Major League Baseball rules. The league\u2019s chief baseball officer, Joe Torre, read that rule aloud to reporters after the game.\n\nAD\n\nTrea Turner was called out on this play.\n\n\n\n\"That's a potentially series changing call.\" - Joe @Buck pic.twitter.com/E3Po7hSNcR \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cIn running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire\u2019s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe rule permits a runner to change directions to avoid a fielder making a play on a batted ball, which is not what Turner did. Turner was running inside the line, then moved to step on the middle of first base, in so doing knocking Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel\u2019s glove off his hand. According to Holbrook, Turner interfered with the throw at first. Holbrook called him out, and he sent Gomes back to first base and Turner to the dugout.\n\nTurner was so upset that he had to be restrained on the top step. Martinez was similarly displeased, and he ran out to home plate yelling and gesticulating about that displeasure.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the 7th inning stretch, Nationals Manager Dave Martinez was visibly upset with the umpires and was ejected during the exchange. pic.twitter.com/AZ23MusrNN \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\nMartinez immediately informed the umpires that the Nationals wanted to protest the game on the grounds that the rule had been misapplied. The umpires donned their headsets to inform league officials in New York of that protest. But according to league rules, teams may not lodge protests over a judgment call. The protest was disallowed. Martinez said later he knew he couldn\u2019t protest a judgment call. Torre had told the managers before the series that if they felt a rule was applied incorrectly, they could ask the umpires to double check. Martinez took advantage of the offer. Then he lodged a request to protest, though he knew it would be futile.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPart of me just said, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ll protest the game.\u2019 I know we can\u2019t. But just check the rules, and they did that,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHonestly, [I was protesting] nothing because I knew we couldn\u2019t. But I wanted them to go look at the replay.\u201d\n\nThe umpires stood with headsets on for nearly eight minutes of delay, which led those in the crowd to believe the play was under review. It wasn\u2019t. Judgment calls cannot be reviewed. So exactly why crew chief Gary Cederstrom took off his headset and held up an out sign \u2014 to indicate the call had been upheld \u2014 is unclear.\n\nAD\n\nTorre said later that the delay shouldn\u2019t have been so long. He said people in his box had tried to make phone calls to league offices and couldn\u2019t get reach people. He thought the umpires, who were trying to oblige Martinez\u2019s request for a rules check, had similar issues.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt should never be that long,\u201d Torre said. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate, and we have to take ownership of that.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Astros Manager A.J. Hinch was l frustrated with the delay, which he said was \u201cunnecessary\u201d because he felt the play required no discussion in the first place. He said umpires told him the delay resulted from the fact that they had trouble getting in touch with league officials.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t protest it. You can\u2019t really do anything, and yet you go to the headset,\u201d Hinch said. \u201c. . . I\u2019m as confused as everybody is because there was no reason to have a delay from my seat.\u201d\n\nEither way, when the dust settled, Anthony Rendon hit a two-run homer that seemed to quell the rage that had built up in the Nationals\u2019 dugout. But it did not calm Martinez, who roared out of the dugout when the inning ended and confronted Holbrook. His bench coach, Chip Hale, and first base coach, Tim Bogar, tried to restrain him. At one point, Martinez spun away from Hale. Were it not for Bogar, he might have reached Holbrook. As Martinez was yelling at Holbrook, Cederstrom jumped in and pointed at him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to make this about me,\u201d Said Martinez, when asked about the exchange. Martinez underwent a cardiac catheterization in late September and is supposed to be managing his stress levels these days.\n\nAD\n\nThe encounter led to his ejection, the first of a manager in the World Series since Bobby Cox in Game 6 in 1996.\n\nUltimately, the call did not doom the Nationals. But it did leave one question unanswered. When Torre met reporters after the game, he was asked where Turner should have run to avoid interfering, given that first base is only so big, and he had to step on it somewhere. Torre said that because Turner chose to run inside foul line, he got in the way when he crossed over to hit first. Had he run outside, he might have been running at a different angle, Gurriel would have had an easier angle to catch the ball.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs you saw, the glove came off Gurriel\u2019s hand, and he wasn\u2019t doing anything but trying to catch the ball,\u201d Torre said.\n\nAD\n\nSaid Turner: \u201cI mean, what else do you do? I don\u2019t know. The batter\u2019s box is in fair territory, first base is in fair territory, I swung, I ran in a straight line, I got hit with the ball, I\u2019m out. I don\u2019t understand it. I can understand if I veered on way or another. I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably get in trouble for all this, but Joe Torre is in charge of the umpires. I think if we want clarification, we should do everything we possibly can to get the calls on the field right. If it\u2019s in the rules that I did the wrong thing, then so be it. But I think this stage is too big and too important to a lot of people to have every avenue not taken advantage of. . . . I think we should do everything we can to get everything as right as possible. And let the players decide the outcome.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The controversial call resulted in a lengthy review by the umpires before being ruled an out.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kp_UbY13tv-k7wyvC-mDbN6rRhM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53E7NVX2YAI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
