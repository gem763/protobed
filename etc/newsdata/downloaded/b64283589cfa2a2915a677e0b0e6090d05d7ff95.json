It is the American scam of rich-kid sports.\n\nDerek Thompson: Three decades ago, America lost its religion. Why?\n\nWhat are rich-kid sports?\n\nAt a time when youth sport participation is stratifying by income, one could argue that even soccer fields have become the domain of the upper-middle-class and above. But true rich-kid sports include water polo, squash, crew, lacrosse, and skiing. One does not simply fall into the river and come out a water-polo star, and there are no casual downhill slalom champions roaming the halls of low-income high schools. These sports require formal training, expensive equipment, and upscale facilities. No wonder they are dominated by affluent young players.\n\nWhile there is nothing morally wrong with enjoying a game of catch in a pool, participation in these activities has come to play a subtle, yet ludicrously powerful, role in the reproduction of elite status in the United States.\n\nAt Harvard, nearly 1,200 undergraduates\u2014or 20 percent of the student body\u2014 participate in intercollegiate athletics. That\u2019s more student athletes than Ohio State University, whose total undergraduate enrollment of 46,000 is nearly seven-times larger.\n\nEarly in the Harvard admissions process, recruited athletes receive special treatment. Most of the school\u2019s 42 sports have liaisons that relay the coach\u2019s preferences for incoming athletes to the admissions department. Nearly 90 percent of recruited athletes gain admission to Harvard, versus about 6 percent of applicants overall. These athletes make up less than 1 percent of Harvard\u2019s applicant pool but more than 10 percent of its admitted class. (The other ten percent of Harvard\u2019s players are walk-ons who likely have also received and benefited from high athletic ratings in the admissions process.)\n\nIt would be one thing if Harvard were giving a leg up to students who might not otherwise afford an education. But Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships. Its athletes tend to be neither promising low-income stalwarts, nor superstars with a chance of going pro. Sports recruitment, it would seem, is not about academics, or equality of opportunity, but about money; it functions as affirmative action for white affluence.\n\nAcross the Ivy League, many teams are whiter (and richer) than the rest of their class. Black and Hispanic students account for less than 10 percent of Ivy athletes in baseball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, rowing, sailing, skiing, softball, squash, tennis, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling. In the 2017-18 year, about 700 Ivy League athletes participated in rowing and lacrosse; fewer than 30 were black, according to NCAA data.", "description": "A new paper provides stark evidence that Harvard gives preferential treatment to affluent white applicants through legacy preferences and sports recruitment.", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_731613419/facebook.jpg?1569965182"}
