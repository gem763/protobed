They\u2019re hardly Posh and Becks. They are shameless.\n\n\"They have shown no remorse to us during or since the trial. We\u2019ve never heard anything from them. Surely, as human beings they should sympathise with us losing such a huge part of our lives.\n\n\"Instead, they seem to be more worried about tainting their reputations.\"\n\nHer daughter, Jade Akoum, 28, added: \"They can have all the money in the world and use a PR company but they can\u2019t change the fact their son killed Yousef and was troubled.\"\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nMolnar's mum Stephanie, 51, the co-founder of a chain of Cheshire nurseries, told the Manchester Evening News her son fully accepts responsibility for Yousef's death.\n\nShe said: \"I cannot imagine what Yousef\u2019s parents and family must be going through as they try to come to terms with this.\n\n\"Joshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef\u2019s death in the act of self-defence and the impact of this acceptance is massive.\n\n\"He will have to live with the responsibility of his role in this for the rest of his life.\n\n\"We are also acutely aware that the hurt and loss that Yousef\u2019s family is experiencing are infinitely greater than anything we are going through and nothing I can say can make up for or change that.\"\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\n(Image: MGS/MEN Media)\n\nJosh Molnar\u2019s father Mark, 56, a maths graduate, is a company director and business consultant.\n\nStraight-A student Yousef, from Burnage, died after he was stabbed in the heart with a flick knife in the upmarket village of Hale Barns, Cheshire, after a row over a cannabis deal that went wrong.\n\nMolnar remains locked up, subject to a 16-month detention and training order.\n\nIt is expected he will be released in March.", "description": "The wealthy parents of Joshua Molnar have signed up with a PR firm after their son knifed Yousef - a move his mum says shows they have 'no remorse'", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Men Media", "Manchester Evening News", "Mgs Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527582.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_ABM_5498.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
