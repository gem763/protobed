Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThe first priority when MPs return on Tuesday will be to seize control of the Commons agenda and use the time to rush through a law. It is still being finalised in cross-party talks. I understand the latest draft says the UK can leave the EU only after the move is approved by parliament, and that if it is not, the PM must seek an extension to the UK\u2019s membership beyond 31 October.\n\nThe aim is to maximise the rebellion so MPs (Labour as well as Tory) who want a deal can join forces with those who want a Final Say referendum or general election.\n\nHolding this rickety coalition together will not be easy, but will be vital. So far, Johnson\u2019s opponents have looked divided among themselves and incoherent. His ruthless move should provide the 10,000-volt shock they need to put personal and party rivalries behind them. But there\u2019s no guarantee that will happen and Boris is gambling that it won\u2019t. That\u2019s another incentive for the rebels to get their act together: to prove him wrong.\n\nThis will mean Labour and the Liberal Democrats resisting the temptation to take potshots at each other, and instead concentrating their fire on the real enemy. This will not come naturally. Labour has lost a big chunk of its 2017 Remain vote to the resurgent Lib Dems, who cannot stomach the thought of Jeremy Corbyn being caretaker prime minister for five minutes, let alone five weeks.\n\nThere are some tentative grounds for hope. Last Tuesday\u2019s talks between opposition parties, called by Corbyn, were positive and constructive. Kenneth Clarke, the longest-serving MP, said he would probably install Corbyn as temporary PM if that was the only way to prevent no deal.\n\nOther Tories might need to follow suit. If they don\u2019t, Corbyn might need to swallow his pride and support Clarke or someone else as leader of a caretaker administration. It might well prove impossible to reach an agreement. Another reason why MPs should put all their energies into passing a watertight law to stop no deal.\n\nSome MPs argue that a vote of no confidence in the government should be brought forward from October to September now that Johnson has squeezed the parliamentary timetable. They are wrong. An early no-confidence vote could play into the prime minister\u2019s hands. It might well be lost; many of the Tories prepared to rebel on legislation would baulk at bringing down their own government. They would be more likely to do so as the cliff edge loomed in October.\n\nEven if such a vote succeeded, Boris would refuse to resign. Unless an alternative PM could win a positive vote of confidence within 14 days, an election would be held and Boris would name the date \u2013 in November, so the UK left during the campaign.\n\nI\u2019m told Conservative campaign HQ is preparing for an election \u2013 but one imposed by parliament, not one sought by Johnson. So pursuing a no-confidence vote might enable that. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap; we would be mad to walk into it,\u201d one senior Labour figure said. \u201cBoris would portray us as on the wrong side in a \u2018people versus parliament\u2019 election.\u201d\n\nIt will not be easy for Corbyn to temper his desire for an election. But he might need to. It might be in his own interests. Labour MPs fear that Johnson would do much better than Theresa May in 2017, not least among Labour Leave voters in the north and Midlands. She tried to appeal to them but failed. But as one Labour MP put it: \u201cThe mood is very different now. Boris is much more of a threat.\u201d", "description": "With hindsight, we should have seen the suspension of parliament coming.
