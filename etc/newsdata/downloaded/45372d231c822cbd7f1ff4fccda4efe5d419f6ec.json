Under the direction of the national security adviser, they work with Trump\u2019s political appointees in directorates that cover specific regions of the world or issues such as counter-terrorism.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry coincided with Trump\u2019s selection of Robert C. O\u2019Brien as the new national security adviser to replace the ousted John Bolton. While many at the NSC were happy to see Bolton gone \u2013 he was viewed as too aloof and too unwilling to use the traditional NSC decision-making process \u2013 it means enduring a third leadership change in less than three years.\n\nPolitical appointees are wondering if O\u2019Brien will keep them. Career staffers are wondering what issues he will prioritize. And there are across-the-board worries that the fallout from the impeachment process could lead to even stricter information controls inside the NSC, making it harder for people to access what they need and to collaborate.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/0d/b3/08dda1db44dc8b035fc7a44ad869/impeachment-evolution2.png\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a general concern, or even maybe more than just concern, that we\u2019re going to reach a state of paralysis now on national security issues and policy issues,\u201d said a former NSC official in touch with several people across the organization. \u201cThe people I\u2019ve talked to are interpreting the coming weeks and months as generally not productive.\u201d\n\nThe people most worried are those who deal with Ukraine and Europe more broadly, said another former NSC official. That\u2019s because at the heart of the impeachment crisis is a July 25 phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenksy.\n\nAccording to a detailed call memo released by the White House, Trump pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate alleged shady actions by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. There\u2019s no evidence the Bidens did anything wrong. But Joe Biden is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, so Trump stands accused of pressuring a foreign government to investigate a potential political rival.\n\nA whistleblower\u2019s complaint fueling the impeachment inquiry says administration officials, under the direction of White House lawyers, took the written record of that conversation out of the system where it would usually be stored and put it in a more secure system, possibly to cover up the president\u2019s actions.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how many people in the NSC played a role in deciding where to place the call record, or otherwise engaged in questionable Ukraine-related activities linked to the impeachment inquiry, but the investigation is damaging to morale, especially for those in the relevant directorates.\n\n\u201cThe people in the Ukraine section are feeling really down,\u201d a second former NSC official said, adding that it\u2019s especially true for the career staffers. \u201cTheir type of work in the background, behind the scenes, is being exposed to the world. Their professionalism is getting politicized.\u201d\n\nTexts released this week as part of the inquiry mentioned at least one NSC staffer, senior director Tim Morrison, though his exact knowledge of the events is unclear. The texts suggest Morrison was involved in trying to set up a phone call between Trump and Zelensky and looking at ways to arrange a Zelensky visit to the White House. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJohn Gans, author of \u201cWhite House Warriors,\u201d a book about the NSC, said that, like the Iran-Contra scandal, the Ukraine-related impeachment inquiry has the potential to \u201crip open the sausage of national security policy-making,\u201d and that the impact on the institution and its people could be serious.\n\nNSC officials, such as Oliver North, were implicated in the convoluted Iran-Contra affair. In that controversy, the administration of President Ronald Reagan secretly sold weapons to Iran, then funneled the money to rebels battling a communist-influenced regime in Nicaragua. The scheme appeared designed to bypass U.S. law. Reagan also hoped that it could help free U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group.\n\nThe affair\u2019s exposure badly stained the NSC\u2019s reputation and spawned several investigations. One panel investigating, known as the Tower Commission, called for limited structural changes to the NSC. Most consequentially, it recommended that the national security adviser and his staff avoid running operations and stick to advisory and coordination work.\n\nGans noted that over the past two weeks, there have been indications that the president may have asked governments beyond Ukraine\u2019s to investigate the Bidens or otherwise act in ways that benefit him personally. On Thursday, for instance, Trump publicly called on China to look into the Bidens, leading to even more hand-wringing in Washington.\n\nDepending on how far Democrats want to take their inquiry, it could drag in other pieces of the NSC, not to mention the State Department and other agencies making national security policy. Based on what happened under Iran-Contra, Gans recommended that NSC staffers who have any ties to the Ukraine controversy, at least, get lawyers.\n\n\u201cOn Iran-Contra it became every man for themselves,\u201d Gans said, predicting that under Trump: \u201cIt will be very dark. And I think anarchic. Your career prospects might be dimmed. This was supposed to be the highlight of your career and now it\u2019s going to be a lowlight.\u201d\n\nThe first former NSC official said one concern he\u2019s hearing from people inside the organization is that it will become even harder to recruit people to fill positions. Most such roles are usually filled by detailees from other parts of the government.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, there was intense competition for NSC slots given their prestige. Over the past three years, however, that interest has fallen dramatically, said the former NSC official, who\u2019s seen the application numbers but declined to specify them.\n\nWith the impeachment inquiry looming, interest could dwindle even further. \u201cI feel like you already don\u2019t have an A Team or B Team. You\u2019re really getting down to who\u2019s left that will say \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d the former official said.\n\nTrump administration spokespeople downplayed such concerns.\n\n\"The National Security Council staff is comprised of exceptional public servants from across the U.S. Government who are working diligently to support President Trump's highly-effective national security agenda. There is no shortage of patriotic individuals willing to work on these critical issues,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\nNSC spokesman Mike Martin noted that \"NSC positions are among the most coveted in the U.S. government\u201d and said people there now are \u201chard at work, as they should be and will continue to be.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s arrival has so far been fairly smooth, current and former officials say, although he spent most of his initial days in New York at the U.N. General Assembly. This was his first full week in Washington, and staffers are hoping he will give each directorate some face-time.\n\nNSC staffers are widely pleased with O\u2019Brien\u2019s choice for his deputy, Matt Pottinger. Pottinger, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and military veteran, has been serving as a senior Asia hand on the council. He\u2019s considered highly competent and organized.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, people love Matt Pottinger,\u201d the current NSC staffer said. \u201cThe best thing they could have done was to keep him and elevate him.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien is expected to bring over some of his aides from the State Department, where he had been serving as a special envoy dealing with hostage issues. NSC staffers also have been told O\u2019Brien will press forth with a process, initiated under the Obama administration and kept up under Trump, to shrink the overall size of the organization. Bloomberg first reported the plans for the cuts, which will be handled largely through attrition.\n\nThe organization\u2019s exact size and structure are not made public, but it\u2019s been reported to have risen above 300 people under Obama. Exactly whom, if anyone, O\u2019Brien asks to leave will be watched carefully in case there are any connections to the Ukraine-related crisis.\n\n\u201cOne question people are asking,\u201d the current NSC staffer said, \u201cis \u2018Are the implicated NSC people going to stay or kicked out\u2019? I\u2019m surprised these people are still here.\u201d\n\nA former administration official who knows several political appointees at the NSC said many of them feel protective of the president, \u201calmost, like, defiant.\u201d But given how busy they are, most are too focused on their work to dwell on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe former administration official also downplayed comparisons to Iran-Contra, saying it\u2019s highly unlikely NSC staffers themselves did anything wrong. If there was any inappropriate action, it originated in the Oval Office, the State Department, or elsewhere outside the NSC\u2019s boundaries, the former official said.\n\nGans, however, pointed out that in Washington, scandals often consume the unsuspecting.\n\n\u201cI assume 99 percent of people are innocent,\u201d Gans said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not going to have to pay for lawyers or not worry about the future of their careers.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/64/ad/b88cc9434bc7a8f67973685b2e11/19105-trump-gty-700.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
