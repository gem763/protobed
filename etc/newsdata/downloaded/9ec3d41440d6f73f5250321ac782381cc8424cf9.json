But here people like to spend time in bars.\n\nThe culture at work was not so different but outside of work it was strange. You do something that\u2019s normal for you but not for other people. For example, Syrians like to walk a lot and we usually take a sandwich \u2013 talking while we are walking. But here people like to spend time in bars. But it\u2019s good to know about countries from around the world, and Melbourne is a very multicultural city with a lot of diversity.\n\nYou get to know more about the life. I started getting interested in philosophy about five years ago, reading more about it. One of my goals is to understand life and people. I\u2019m also a big arts lover. Painting, music, any kind of art. I say philosophy is a kind of art.\n\nThe good thing about working at IRESS is that if you\u2019re programming software, you gain experience and knowledge about finance and the exchange market and shares.\n\nMulla is following the Essendon AFL team, thanks largley to player Adam Saad. AAP\n\nI\u2019m trying to meet people from different teams to ask them more about their work. Sometimes I have lunch with people so we can talk about our experience. Sometimes I ask people to drink a coffee together and to chat. I have started to support the Essendon Bombers AFL team. They have a player, Adam Saad, whose parents are from Egypt. I like Egypt.\n\nAndrew Walsh\n\nOne of our directors, John Cameron, was on the board of Talent Beyond Boundaries (TBB) and was providing IT assistance so TBB could establish a mechanism to collect CVs from refugees and sort them out. He spoke to us about it and I suggested we should be involved.\n\nTBB had worked out how they were going to get government acceptance for this special kind of visa and we were the first employer to take advantage of it. We applied two years ago and two software engineers from Syria, Tarek and Derar Alkhateeb, began working with us this year.\n\nInitially, we were simply looking for an additional recruitment avenue. Plus, there was the aspect of doing the right thing for people in situations they didn\u2019t choose and whose lives were severely affected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew Walsh is keen to hire more skilled refugees. Supplied\n\nTarek has a completely different life in Melbourne compared with what he had in Syria. He\u2019s an outgoing guy, but he also has an aptitude for trying new things. He has an interest in the arts, which is not normal for a software engineer.\n\nI think the extremity of his life experiences shows people around him how much life changes and that you\u2019ve got to make the most of every opportunity.\n\nHe\u2019s been here for more than six months now. At the beginning he was quiet and was a bit insecure about his language skills. But I don\u2019t think that would have limited his ability to communicate in any way.\n\nThe challenge we\u2019ve had for a long time has been that we\u2019ve told external recruiters we just want someone smart, and that\u2019s not how they work. They work in lists and boxes.\n\nWe employ about 200 people a year and I can see us employing more refugees. We are using the TBB recruitment process as another channel, and the application and interview process is no different from how we would recruit domestically. We do recorded interviews where a candidate answers a set of questions. When Tarek and Derar applied, they were the best of everyone who applied for those roles.\n\nIn the past we had relied wholly on recruitment agencies, but we shifted the dial two or three years ago and now have an internal recruitment team that represents 85 per cent of all appointments.\n\nThe reality is that top talent is hard to find, especially software engineers. We get lots of applicants, but the top end is thin.\n\nOne factor for the change was the expense of the external agencies. The other was the quality and consistency of employment through those agencies. We felt we saw lots of people in the recruitment process who weren\u2019t offered roles or just missed out because they weren\u2019t the top candidate, and that pool of talent was an asset we wanted to hold on to. Controlling that process internally would allow us to build on that and create that network ourselves.\n\nThe depth of IT experience in Australia is not ideal. People like the glamour of Silicon Valley, so there can be a bit of a brain drain. But I think that kind of headline is dangerous. The reality is that top talent is hard to find, especially software engineers. We get lots of applicants, but the top end is thin and the competition is intense, whether that is the number of top applicants or the price you have to pay to secure those applicants.\n\nThe number of new starters we have from overseas or have moved here to work with us is quite high. What has been interesting in talking to our recruits is that in their experience Australian companies lack diversity.\n\nThey\u2019ve found the IRESS application process quite welcoming because we\u2019re interested in their skills, intellect, capability and how they apply that, not their accent. We haven\u2019t demonstrated the kind of prejudice they\u2019ve seen in other attempts at getting roles in Australia. So the cultural diversity at IRESS is very broad, which we\u2019re quite proud of. It was a natural progression to think about how to recruit from refugee situations.", "description": "Thanks to a non-profit initiative, Syrian software engineer Tarek Mulla has made a new life in Australia after being hired by financial services software company IRESS.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8919%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_534%2C$y_370/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4607bd6813a8adc2058e57f1926aac1fc6fa4128", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
