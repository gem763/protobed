The financial institution decided to stand up a WhatsApp channel, as that's where most of its younger customers wanted their interaction with a bank to take place.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT Digital Transformation: A CXO's Guide You can download all of the articles in this special report in one PDF (free registration required).

And so they were able to put together a platform that can run a WhatsApp based environment in less than a week and go off and deliver that to customers,\" Badani said.\n\n\"That's change that companies as diverse as UPS, Volkswagon, and Emirates NBD are going through. Each of these have sort of talked through what [change] means with regards to the organisation they have, the culture -- the notion of people, process, and technology that they've got to work with.\"\n\nWhile the organisations are from different industries, Badani said what they have in common is that their customer interactions are of a hybrid nature.\n\n\"Being able to craft an environment that can span the direct physical, digital, and APIs critical for how you evolve and grow. And it doesn't really matter what kind of company you're in,\" he continued.\n\nThis requirement, Badani would argue, is true even for companies that were born in the cloud.\n\nUsing online eyeglass retailer Warby Parker as his example, Badani said that due to the company starting in the cloud, it had no physical engagement with customers.\n\n\"Then they realised, well, you know, people are going to have to come in and do eye exams ... we should open some stores,\" he said.\n\n\"Regardless of where you start, and if you start directly from the physical side of it, or from the digital, being able to bring those worlds together.\n\n\"Today is the least amount of change that we'll ever see.\"\n\nAsha Barbaschow travelled to Red Hat Forum as a guest of Red Hat.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Red Hat senior vice president of cloud platforms Ashesh Badani details how his company is helping three customers from three different industries, touting the need for change as the constant.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/22/9ba32e53-b908-4a9a-8046-10c1a6280a39/thumbnail/770x578/82c5dfbacf33072b9136a055fff9062a/ashish-badani-red-hat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
