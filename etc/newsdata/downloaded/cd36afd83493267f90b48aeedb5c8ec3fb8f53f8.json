The core of the storm will \"move dangerously close\" to the coasts of Florida and Georgia throughout the night and into Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nWhile the once major hurricane has lost strength since it came ashore on the Abaco Islands over the weekend as a Category 5, Dorian's rain bands and wind field have recently expanded.\n\n\"Dorian has become a larger hurricane,\" according to the latest NHC advisory. \"Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles.\"\n\nAs Dorian moves toward the U.S. coastline, it is also gradually picking up speed.\n\nAfter stalling out over Grand Bahama most of Monday crawling along at 1 mph, Dorian has upped its pace to about 6 mph, \"and a slightly faster motion\" is expected later today and tonight, with a turn north forecast by Wednesday evening and then a turn north-northeast by Thursday.\n\nDorian is a little more than 125 miles offshore from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and has maximum sustained winds of 110 mph, according to the NHC.\n\nThe storm spent most of Monday and early Tuesday relentlessly pounding the northern Bahamas with high winds and catastrophic flooding.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard released photos Tuesday of some of the damage in the island chain, which showed bent trees, boats strewn across land and wide swaths of land underwater.\n\nNPR's Greg Allen, reporting on the storm from West Palm Beach, Fla., told NPR's Morning Edition the U.S. Coast Guard is in the Bahamas assisting with evacuations and rescues.\n\n\"On [Great] Abaco, the U.S. Coast Guard arrived yesterday and has been using helicopters to airlift injured people to safety. But the Bahamian officials haven't really been able to get out much in Abaco yet,\" Allen said.\n\nHe adds that no aid can be provided or accurate surveys of the extent of the damage made until conditions improve there, which may not come until Wednesday.\n\nRear Adm. Eric Jones, who oversees U.S. Coast Guard operations in the Southeast U.S. and Caribbean, says officials are working tirelessly to get to hard-hit areas in the Bahamas.\n\n\"Since last night, we've only made it about 12 miles further to the northwest, up around the Treasure Cay area of Great Abaco Island,\" Jones said in a Tuesday afternoon interview on Fox News.\n\nHe says crews are still waiting to get up to Little Abaco Island and across to Grand Bahama. The Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection officials are providing search and rescue assistance, Jones said.\n\n\"They're flying over assessing where we can potentially bring in boats and land aircraft. And then they're looking for folks in distress that they can get to,\" he said.\n\nThe Bahamian government on Tuesday reduced the storm advisory from a hurricane warning to a topical storm warning for Grand Bahama and the Abacos, according to an earlier alert from NHC.\n\nAs Dorian tracks toward the U.S. mainland, storm effects are likely to be felt along the Southeastern coast from Florida up to North Carolina. Virginia could feel the effects of the storm in the coming days.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMuch of Florida's Atlantic coast from Sebastian Inlet near Vero Beach to as far north as Ponte Vedra Beach near Jacksonville are under a hurricane warning, according to the latest advisory.\n\nSouth Carolina's Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters Tuesday that all of his state's coastline is \"either under a hurricane watch or a hurricane warning.\"\n\n\"South Carolina is still in the path of what is a very destructive and deadly storm,\" McMaster said.\n\nHe warned that the storm could produce \"dramatic flooding in the low country,\" especially in the port city of Charleston. The state's Edisto Beach north to the South Santee River are under a hurricane warning, according to the NHC.\n\nNHC says the center of Dorian will move \"near or over\" the coast of South Carolina and North Carolina Thursday through Friday morning.\n\nA hurricane watch is in effect for North Carolina's coast up to Duck and including Albemarle and Pamlico sounds and along the state's northern border with Virginia.\n\nOn Tuesday, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a mandatory evacuation order for all of the state's islands. Those in Dorian's path \"will be exposed to substantial risk of injury or death,\" he said.\n\nThe order goes into effect 8 a.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nWhen Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas on Sunday, it was one of the strongest hurricanes on record to hit the archipelago. It hit the Abaco islands with wind gusts of up to 220 mph.\n\nHubert Minnis, the Bahamian prime minister, announced Monday evening that at least five people died in the storm. Some fear the death toll could rise.\n\nDarren Henfield, the Bahamian minister of foreign affairs, told reporters Monday that conditions on the islands remain treacherous.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tim Aylen/AP Tim Aylen/AP\n\n\"From all accounts we have received catastrophic damage. It is not safe to go outdoors. Power lines are down, lampposts are down, trees are across the street,\" Henfield said.\n\nThe Bahamas Press, an online publication, posted video of and stories about Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco being \"completely destroyed\" by Dorian. In a separate post, it showed images from the Abacos that it says are of people who were killed by the storm being loaded on a truck.\n\nThe publication also says it believes the death count is higher than the one officials are currently giving.\n\n\"PM Hubert Minnis claims the [Royal Bahamas Police Force] has confirmed five deaths, however, sources on the ground tell us bodies are being collected all across Abaco this afternoon,\" the publication writes.\n\nHurricane chaser Josh Morgerman, who weathered the storm in Marsh Harbour, tweeted after a two-day hiatus that his decision had been a mistake.\n\nYep, I\u2019m alive. Made it to Nassau. #Hurricane #DORIAN: By far the most intense cyclone I\u2019ve witnessed in 28 years of chasing. Thought I was playing it safe by riding it out in a solid-concrete school on a hill in Marsh Harbour. Thought wrong. \u2014 Josh Morgerman (@iCyclone) September 3, 2019\n\nAccording to a Monday advisory by the International Red Cross, Dorian caused \"extensive damage\" across both Abaco and Grand Bahama. Early estimates by the humanitarian aid organization say as many as \"13,000 houses may have been severely damaged or destroyed.\"", "description": "Dorian is roughly 105 miles off the shore of Fort Pierce, Fla.
