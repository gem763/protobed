Given that the year is 1932, the first is more easily realised than the second, yet both, in their way, are radical.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the ecclesiastical backdrop. For Violet, who lost first her fiance and then a brother to the trenches, God died in the great war. More than 16 years have since passed but only now, as a 38-year-old spinster, has she finally plucked up the nerve to leave behind her overbearing mother and their Southampton home and make a life of her own.\n\nViolet is one of the so-called \u201csurplus women\u201d created by the war\u2019s casualties and the resulting gender imbalance. It\u2019s a stigma that smarts every time a stranger shoots a glance at her naked ring finger; she feels it still more acutely in the drab struggle to support herself. A typist for an insurance firm, her salary is \u201crather like a pair of ill-fitting shoes that could be worn, but that pinched and rubbed and left calluses\u201d. She\u2019s often starving.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear echoes of the estimable Barbara Pym as Violet\u2019s heels clip across the cathedral\u2019s inner close\n\nWinchester\u2019s squat cathedral is a stroll away from where she rooms, and nonbeliever though she\u2019s become, evensong soothes her. It\u2019s there that she spots the brightly coloured cushions, each marked with the initials of the woman who stitched it. Thrilled by the notion of leaving a mark of her own, Violet joins the volunteer \u201cbroderers\u201d, finding purpose in their often prickly companionship. Soon, she\u2019s haggling for a pay rise, crushing on an older man and striding off into the countryside on a solo walking holiday. But in a society that remains set up for marriage, calamity stalks her.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear echoes of the estimable Barbara Pym as Violet\u2019s heels clip across the cathedral\u2019s inner close. Allusions to casual sex and lesbian passion notwithstanding, days are punctuated by cups of tea and people remain largely trapped by their manners. At one particularly stirring moment, instead of finding herself kissed, Violet is treated to a three-course meal, with custard on her apple crumble and cream in her coffee. \u201cAfterwards she felt almost sated,\u201d Chevalier deadpans. Meanwhile, on the wireless, news of Adolf Hitler\u2019s election in Germany casts an ominous shadow.\n\nIt\u2019s a time and a place that is perfectly suited to Chevalier\u2019s meticulous scene-setting, gentle pacing and gimlet eye for hidden hurts and secret longings. As for the embroidery, with its repetitive stitches that slowly, almost inconspicuously add up to something dazzling, she couldn\u2019t have picked a more satisfying metaphor. After all, Violet and her fellow broderers are women building not only themselves, but the very idea of independent single womanhood in a world that does its best to ignore their existence.\n\n\u2022 A Single Thread by Tracy Chevalier is published by The Borough Press (\u00a314.99).
