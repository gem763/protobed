In fact, the current system strands the states as islands,\u201d Mr Wymer said.\n\nHe said the alternative to the RERT is transmission by connecting those states with excess capacity to those that don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFor example, he cited Snowy Hydro\u2019s small Tailem Bend solar project in South Australia could realistically provide some of the energy needs for NSW at times of high demand if we had a more integrated national transmission grid.\n\n\u201cYou want the SA solar plant to compete with the black coal in NSW and the Victorian gas peakers to compete with the NSW gas peakers. You want us to compete with Energy Australia. You don\u2019t want us to sit back in our own states and not compete when the prices are high.\u201d\n\nMr Wymer said the earliest possible build of AEMO\u2019s Integrated System Plan (ISP) to create a competitive transmission grid is the key to promoting real competition.\n\nFor example, last summer\u2019s blackout in Victoria when the state found itself short of about 300 MW, Snowy Hydro had 1500 MW sitting at Tumut (which is halfway between Sydney and Melbourne) but it couldn\u2019t be dispatched because there wasn\u2019t the transmission capacity.\n\n\u201cAnd without more transmission capacity we\u2019re just going to be exposed to more blackouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the winners to emerge. We want market competition to force the generators to work across the whole market and transmission is the only big stick anyone has - it can greatly increase competition right across the market and if we can make each plant compete with other sources of production you will see a significant reduction in wholesale prices which will lead to lower prices for consumers,\u201d he said.", "description": "Transmission and storage will bring energy prices down as states share capacity during times of peak demand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2695%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_21%2C$y_13/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1a4f7ee32ea956fef180134b66fdaab4f192e252", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
