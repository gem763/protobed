All in all, normalisation seems to be have been moved to the back of the priority list, given the current external backdrop,\" Deyanov said.\n\nDeputy Governor Marton Nagy said on Wednesday that low interest rates were here to stay, because global inflation rates were unlikely to return to their previous higher levels in the coming years.\n\nThe central bank targets 3% inflation with a tolerance range of a percentage point on either side. Tax-adjusted core inflation, its preferred measure of lasting price trends, rose to 3.4% in September from 3.2% in August.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters expect headline inflation to average around 3.3% a year through 2021. Economic growth is expected to slow to 3.25% next year from 4.6% in 2019.\n\nThe central bank has said any necessary adjustment of monetary conditions would be implemented through changes in the overnight deposit rate or tools designed to adjust market liquidity.\n\n\"We don't see any change in monetary policy in the foreseeable future,\" said economist Peter Virovacz at ING. \"Regarding the risk assessment, we see the risks tilted to the downside, meaning we see higher probability for a dovish step than a hawkish one as a next move by the NBH.\" (Reporting by Gergely Szakacs, editing by Larry King)", "description": "By Gergely SzakacsBUDAPEST, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The National Bank of Hungary  (NBH) is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at least  until the end of...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
