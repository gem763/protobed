But as the nationwide anti-austerity protests, triggered by a transportation fees hike, raged on, President Sebastian Pinera announced on Wednesday that both will be cancelled.\n\n\u201cThis has been a very difficult decision, a decision that causes us a lot of pain, because we fully understand the importance of APEC and COP-25 for Chile and for the world,\u201d Pinera said in a statement.\n\nAlso on rt.com Protesters in Chile reject reform proposal, face water cannon & tear gas as unrest continues (VIDEO, PHOTOS)\n\nChile\u2019s move caught the White House by surprise, an official told Reuters, saying that Washington had learned about Pinera\u2019s decision from news reports and was looking for more information.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had previously said that \u2018Phase One\u2019 of a major trade deal between China and the US could be signed at the APEC summit.\n\nThe bitter socio-economic protests in Chile have been accompanied by clashes, riots, and military curfews introduced in the capital of Santiago. Sparked by the planned public transport fare increase, they later grew into a broader movement against the right-wing Pinera\u2019s austerity policies. As of October 26, at least 20 people had been killed, while 6,000 had been arrested.\n\nUS officials have accused \u201cforeign actors\u201d \u2013 specifically Russia \u2013 of stirring up the mass protests and \u201ctrying to undermine all Chilean institutions and society.\u201d\n\nIn response, Moscow slammed Washington\u2019s \u201cknee-jerk desire\u201d to blame everything on Russia, while not acknowledging the \u201cconsequences of imposing neoliberal economic ideas on other countries.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com The Russians are meddling again, this time in Chile, warns US diplomat\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised if soon US experts see \u2018the hand of Moscow\u2019 in the rejection of the Monroe Doctrine by Latin Americans regardless of their domestic political preferences,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, adding that in reality \u201cRussia is interested in a stable Latin America that is politically and economically sustainable.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
