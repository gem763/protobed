Getting to talk about \u2018Star Wars\u2019 with him and the current \u2018Star Wars\u2019 team was the thrill of a lifetime, and we will always be indebted to the saga that changed everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are only so many hours in the day,\u201d they continued, \u201cand we felt we could not do justice to both \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and our Netflix projects. So we are regretfully stepping away.\u201d\n\nThe trilogy was intended to be a post-Skywalker series for the big screen that was set to premiere in 2022. Benioff and Weiss were confirmed in May as the directors of the first film.\n\nLucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy softened the goodbye, noting they could come back in some form.\n\n\u201cDavid Benioff and Dan Weiss are incredible storytellers,\u201d she said, according to Variety. \u201cWe hope to include them in the journey forward when they are able to step away from their busy schedule to focus on \u2018Star Wars.\u2019\u201d\n\nBenioff and Weiss, who were criticized for the final season of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d reportedly signed in August the $200 million production deal with Netflix that is now scuttling their \u201cStar Wars\u201d plans.\n\n\u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d premieres in December and will close out the Skywalker big-screen era.", "description": "The two said their $200 million Netflix deal didn't give them enough time to work on the next generation of the space epic.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db82d6720000041325071a3.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
