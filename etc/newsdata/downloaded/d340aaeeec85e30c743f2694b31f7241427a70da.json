Menashi, nominated to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, parried the questions on the basis of confidentiality, prompting Democratic frustration on that matter and he also got related pushback from a Republican senator who accused him of not being forthcoming about his judicial philosophy.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, asked whether Mr. Menashi worked on the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy or whether he handled the president\u2019s move to limit the number of refugees entering the country.\n\n\u201cWith my duties of confidentiality to my client, I\u2019m acknowledging I\u2019ve worked on immigration matters \u2014 but can\u2019t speak further about that,\u201d Mr. Menashi told the committee.\n\nThe lack of details about his work didn\u2019t sit well with Ms. Feinstein and her Democratic colleagues, who despite persistent prodding got no real details. They said the information was necessary for evaluating Mr. Menashi\u2019s qualifications for the federal bench.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on this committee for 26 years, seen a lot of nominees, and no one has ever used, \u2018I\u2019m not allowed to talk about it,\u2019\u201d Ms Feinstein said.\n\nBut Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican, jumped to Mr. Menashi\u2019s defense, saying a lawyer has a duty to protect a client\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cIt is not appropriate to beat up Mr. Menashi on the basis of permission he has not been granted to reveal confidential information,\u201d Mr. Lee said.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican, also expressed frustration with Mr. Menashi over his opaque responses to legal hypotheticals about how he would approach certain statutes as a judge.\n\n\u201cI wish you would be more forthcoming. This isn\u2019t supposed to be a game,\u201d he told the nominee.\n\nMr. Menashi was already a target of the progressive left before Wednesday\u2019s hearing, where protesters loudly voiced opposition to his nomination outside the committee room on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe resistance largely arose after MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow aired a 13-minute segment last month, attacking a law review article Mr. Menashi wrote years ago that the TV host suggested was racist.\n\nThe 65-page article from 2010 for the University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law drew fire over Mr. Menashi\u2019s noting that ethnonationalism is an accepted part of liberal democracies in a defense of Israel as \u201ca Jewish state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI abhor discrimination. I value this country\u2019s traditions of tolerance and equality before the law,\u201d Mr. Menashi said, defending himself from the attacks. He said the point of his article was to note that some liberal democracies have an ethnic basis.\n\nPast writings have sunk at least one of the president\u2019s nominees in the past.\n\nRyan Bounds, who was nominated to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, had his nomination withdrawn over concerns about one of his college writings that some characterized as racially insensitive. But others such as Judge Neomi Rao, who was questioned her writings on date rape for the Yale Free Press, eventually won confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said he thought the lack of clarification on Mr. Menashi\u2019s White House Counsel Office work pertaining to immigration policy was a bigger hurdle than his writings on ethnonationalism.\n\nMr. Tobias said the committee should have worked with the White House to get specifics on what Mr. Menashi could or could not reveal.\n\n\u201cIt just has that rushed feeling about it. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have time to get that right,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Menashi was rated \u201cwell qualified\u201d by the American Bar Association, which said he satisfied the organization\u2019s \u201cvery high standards with respect to integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.\u201d\n\nHe also clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., as well as on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.\n\nIf confirmed, Mr. Menashi would be the 44th circuit court judge appointed by Mr. Trump, who has won two Supreme Court appointments, 43 circuit and 105 district court confirmations. In the same period of his presidency, President Obama also had two Supreme Court appointments, but only saw 20 circuit court and 74 district court confirmations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
