And if you use language that \"dumbs you down,\" you may be misunderstood by those around you at work, which can significantly hurt your ability to advance.\n\n\"A well-spoken person never goes out of style,\" says Taylor. \"While it can be tempting to use shortcuts when speaking, go into slang mode, or just follow the crowd, you should try not to.\"\n\nUsing the following words and terms can chip away at your professional image, she says. \"We're all capable of falling into these traps, but the trick is to catch yourself and avoid making them a habit.\"\n\nHere are 39 words and phrases we all use from time to time that may be dumbing us down:\n\n'Legit'\n\n\"It just doesn't convey a high degree of intelligence,\" Taylor said. \"You'll be seen as far more credible when you're direct and speak professionally.\"\n\n'OMG, shut up!'\n\nYou never want to use this to tell someone to be quiet at work \u2014 but that's not even what we're talking about here.\n\nIf you're genuinely surprised or excited by something at work, there are better ways to express your those feelings than saying something dumb like, \"Shut up?!?!\"\n\nInstead, try \"Wow, that's great!\" or \"I'm so thrilled about this opportunity!\"\n\n'!@%&$'\n\nAvoid vulgar language and profanities at work. They're unprofessional and dumb you down.\n\n\"Having a trash mouth never got anyone promoted, and can get you into trouble at work. Save it for your ride home (unless you take mass transit),\" Taylor said.\n\n'Ditto'\n\nIf you're trying to say \"me, too\" then say \"me, too.\"\n\n'Oh my God!'\n\nThere are many better, smarter ways to express your shock or excitement.\n\n'My bad' or 'oopsies'\n\nThese are two of the worst ways to own up to or acknowledge a mistake at work. Go with the most straightforward and professional version: \"That was my mistake. I'm sorry.\"\n\n'Whatever'\n\n\"This is part of a 'set' or family that goes with 'Totally,' 'Like' and 'Um.' A family that no one wants to visit,\" Taylor said.\n\n'Chill out'\n\nFirst of all, you almost never want to tell your boss or colleague to \"relax\" or \"calm down\" because nobody likes hearing that. But if you're going to do it, don't use the phrase \"chill out.\" It's just obnoxious and unprofessional.\n\n'Ironic'\n\nChances are, you're not using it correctly, and you'll just sound dumb when you say it.\n\n'Totally!'\n\n\"Another classic that hasn't parted from today's jargon, but can be reminiscent of walking through a mall bursting with teen drama,\" Taylor said.\n\n'For sure'\n\nJust stick with \"yes.\"\n\n'No worries' or 'No prob'\n\n\"I have fallen prey to this, and it's not a big offender,\" Taylor admitted. \"But when it's used to replace 'you're welcome,' I fear that 'you're welcome' will fade into old English oblivion.\"\n\n'Booyah'\n\nIt's great to be happy at work. But when you're particularly excited or proud of something, don't yell out \"booyah!\" It's annoying for so many reasons, Taylor said.\n\n'Dude,' 'man,' or 'bro'\n\nNo, no, no. Don't refer to your male colleagues as \"dude\" or \"man\" or worst of all, \"bro.\"\n\n'Chicks' or 'girls'\n\nThe same goes for \"chicks\" and \"girls.\" It's highly offensive and inappropriate, even if you're a woman referring to other women this way.\n\n'You guys'\n\nWhile most of your coworkers likely won't take no offence to this, some people might feel uncomfortable being addressed this way\u2014 so you're better off avoiding it.\n\n'Awesome'\n\n\"Granted, it could be a lot worse,\" she said. \"But this is one of those words that has gotten so overused, that when you say, 'That's awesome,' it's almost like saying, 'Nice ... what else?'\"\n\n'Whattup?' or 'sup?'\n\nStop with the slang.\n\n'Um' or 'uh'\n\nWe understand you sometimes use these as filler words when you're nervous, and you may feel like you can't control the number of \"ums\" and \"uhs\" you use on a daily basis, but you can try!\n\nOverusing these words will make you sound less competent and can kill your credibility, so you'll want to pay attention to how frequently you use them, and take the right steps to stop saying them forever.\n\n'Literally'\n\n\"This makes you wonder how much productivity time in corporate America could be gained if this useless word could be 'literally' banished,\" Taylor says.\n\n'Spoiler alert'\n\nThis phrase can sometimes be funny or cute, but it often comes off as cheesy, which can make you seem a little less intelligent.\n\n'Like'\n\nThis is, like, another filler word you'll want to stop using, like, immediately.\n\n'Duh'\n\nDo we really need to explain this one?\n\n'Yup,' 'yah,' 'nope,' and 'nah'\n\nIt's \"yes\" and \"no.\" That's all.\n\n'Shout-out'\n\n\"No one really needs to shout if they're congratulating you,\" Taylor said. \"So let's put this phrase to rest.\"\n\n'I know, riiight?!'\n\n\"Well-meaning people use this when they're trying to be very agreeable. But when it's virtually in every other sentence, it can seem hollow and irritating,\" Taylor said.\n\n'Extra'\n\nAny word that's currently \"cool\" in popular culture should be \"reserved for a dorm room, not a board room,\" Taylor said.\n\nMade-up words\n\nJust ... don't.\n\nMisused words\n\nIf you're not really sure what a word means, don't use it.", "description": "Stop saying these things, like, legit, right now.", "authors": ["Jacquelyn Smith"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/57c5a1f7b996eb93008b527c-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
