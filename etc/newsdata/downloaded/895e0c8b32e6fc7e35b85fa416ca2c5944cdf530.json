No other details about the explosion were available. The victim\u2019s name has not yet been released.\n\nParties at which parents-to-be reveal the gender of their unborn child to friends and relatives, often with some kind of stunt, have increased in popularity in the last decade, particularly in the US.\n\nOne of the pioneers of the gender-reveal movement said in July that it was time to \u201cre-evaluate\u201d the practice and that her own daughter had begun to explore her gender and defy gender norms.\n\nJenna Karvunidis, 39, explained that in 2008 she had baked a cake with pink icing inside to reveal the gender of her daughter to her friends and family, never realising that her concept would be replicated and taken to extremes by others.\n\nIn April 2017 an off-duty US border patrol agent, Dennis Dickey, caused $8m of damage to 19,000 hectares (47,000 acres) of Arizona forest when he shot at a target full of blue-coloured explosive as a means of announcing the gender of his unborn child.\n\nOther gender-reveal stunts have included an alligator being fed a watermelon filled with blue dye that splattered as it bit it.\n\nIn July police in Queensland, Australia, released footage of a father-to-be whose attempt to send blue smoke from his car tyres forced the driver and passenger out of the car as a fire spread.", "description": "Investigators say debris hit 56-year-old, who was pronounced dead at scene in Knoxville", "authors": ["Staff", "Catherine Bennett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde2d5d6dfb7bee47614ad826ba5a8eef4097662/0_201_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=47865dc07f778129495ed41489a5bd3d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
