But may we draw your attention to the \u2014 dare we say it \u2014 superior pumpkin spice flavour: the classic pumpkin pie. Let the others sip or dash their PSLs, while you whip this up, carve out a satisfyingly smooth, rich, and flaky wedge, swaddle it in whipped cream and tuck into your slice.\n\nClassic Pumpkin Pie\n\nFeel free to brush the pastry with some egg wash (1 egg beaten with 2 teaspoons of water) if you want a more polished crust. Also, you could add a splash of rum or brandy to the whipped cream if you so desire.\n\nIngredients\n\nPastry:\n\n1 \u2153 cups all-purpose flour, sifted (plus more for flouring the work surface)\n\n\u00bc tsp salt\n\n\u00bd cup cold unsalted butter, cubed\n\n\u00bc cup ice water\n\nPumpkin Pie Spice:\n\n1 tsp ground cinnamon\n\n\u00bd tsp ground ginger\n\n\u00bd tsp ground nutmeg\n\n\u215b tsp ground cloves\n\n\u215b tsp ground allspice\n\nPumpkin Pie Filling:\n\n1 \u00bd cups pure pumpkin puree\n\n\u2154 cup packed brown sugar\n\n2 tbsp molasses\n\n\u00bd tsp salt\n\n2 eggs\n\n1 egg yolk\n\n1 cup evaporated milk\n\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n\nFor serving:\n\n1 cup 35% whipping cream, for serving\n\n\u00bc cup icing sugar, sifted\n\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n\nSpecial equipment:\n\n9-inch pie pan\n\nParchment paper\n\nPie weights\n\nLarge measuring cup (or bowl with spouted lip to pour from)\n\nPreparation\n\nPastry:\n\nWhisk together the flour and salt, then cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Using a fork, stir in the water until the dough starts to come together. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten it into a disk, then wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n\nPreheat the oven to 400F degrees. Set the oven rack to the bottom third position in the oven. Lightly flour a clean work surface, and roll the chilled pastry out on it into a 12-inch round, to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Place the pastry into the pie pan, pressing into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess overhang to about \u00bd-inch, the fold the overhang under itself (the folded edge should be flush with the edge of the pie pan). Using your thumb and forefinger, flute the edge of pastry or simply press edges with tines of a fork. Chill for 15 minutes.\n\nPrick the bottom of the pastry all over with a fork. Line the pastry shell with parchment paper or foil and fill with pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and crisp, about 5 to 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.\n\nPumpkin Pie Spice:\n\nStir together the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and allspice until combined; set aside.\n\nFilling:\n\nReduce the oven heat to 325F degrees. Stir together the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, molasses, 2 teaspoons of the pumpkin pie spice, vanilla and salt until blended. Whisk the eggs, egg yolk and milk until blended, then stir them into the pumpkin puree mixture. Transfer entire mixture into a large measuring cup.\n\nPour the filling into the blind baked pie shell. Bake pie until the filling is set around the edges but the centre jiggles slightly, about 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Once cooled, you could store the pie in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, or serve immediately\n\nFor serving:\n\nWhip the cream with electric beaters until stiff peaks form. Beat in the icing sugar, vanilla and the remaining pumpkin pie spice. Slice the pie and serve with a generous dollop of the whipped cream.\n\nYield: Makes 1 9-inch pie, about 8 servings", "description": "Pumpkin spiced latte who?", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340161.1572383060!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/pumpkin-pie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
