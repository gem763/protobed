One of the most iconic WAG feuds came in 2001, when Katie Price - then Jordan - was dating Manchester United star Dwight York (pictured at 2001's Laureus World Sports Awards in Monaco) locked horns with his teammate David Beckham's wife Victoria, who is said to have jeered at her and sang Who Let The Dogs Out?\n\n'Who Let The Dogs Out?' Victoria Beckham Vs. Katie Price\n\nWhen Katie Price was dating footballer Dwight Yorke in 2001, she attended a Manchester United match in which she was met with his teammate David Beckham's wife Victoria in the players' lounge.\n\nIn the stuff of showbiz legend, it has been told that Victoria, along with a pal, began singing Baha Men's 1999 hit Who Let The Dogs Out? as Katie approached. She said: 'Years ago she sang the song in the Manchester United lounge and there's where it started from. And in a nightclub David held my hand behind her back.'\n\nIt was in her 2004 autobiography, that Katie alleged that David - who has staunchly denied the claims - held her hand in a nightclub, as she penned: 'I didn't feel star-struck by Victoria but I must admit to feeling a bit of a thrill around David. He is so good looking, has such a fit body and is so nice with it.'\n\nIn 2000, their paths crossed for the first time when Victoria collaborated with Katie's then-boyfriend Dane Bowers on her track Out Of Your Mind and after a performance at Party In The Park, the group went clubbing.\n\nWay back when: In 2000, their paths crossed for the first time when Victoria collaborated with Katie's then-boyfriend Dane Bowers (right) in on her track Out Of Your Mind and after a performance at Party In The Park (left), the group went clubbing\n\nKatie alleged: 'Dane was DJ'ing and I was standing with the famous couple. Suddenly I felt someone take my hand and squeeze it gently as if to reassure me that I shouldn't be overawed by all the hype...\n\n'It was David. I looked at him in surprise and he was looking right back at me. Imagine how you would feel if David Beckham held your hand! Victoria was standing right next to him so I thought I'd better keep my mouth shut...\n\n'I would have given anything for her to disappear at that moment and leave me alone with one of the world's sexiest men. But I guess I'll never really know what David was thinking. Maybe he was showing that he understood what it was like to be caught up in Dane and Victoria's desperate bid to become number one.'\n\nThe duo never reconciled and took further swipes over the years.\n\nHere come the girls! No WAG lover could forget the iconic 2006 Baden-Baden World Cup, where football took a backseat to the hard-partying, perma-tanned, designer-loving WAGs and their wild ways Pictured L-R: Victoria Beckham, Unknown, Coleen (wife of Wayne), Louise Owen (wife of Michael Owen) and Elen Rives (then-fianc\u00e9e of Frank Lampard)\n\nHurt: At the helm was Victoria, who was supporting husband David, while she found an apprentice in Cheryl Cole, who was backing her then-husband Ashley Cole in England's bid for glory\n\n'I was quite shocked by that': Victoria Beckham Vs. Cheryl\n\nNo WAG lover could forget the iconic 2006 Baden-Baden World Cup, where football took a backseat to the hard-partying, perma-tanned, designer-loving WAGs and their wild ways.\n\nAt the helm was Victoria, who was supporting husband David, while she found an apprentice in Cheryl Cole, who was backing her then-husband Ashley Cole in England's bid for glory.\n\nWhile they seemed thick as thieves during the tournament, Cheryl was left heartbroken two years later when Ashley cheated with hairdresser Aimee Walton. Further cheating allegations led to their ultimate split in 2010.\n\nShe later revealed she was disappointed when Victoria did not reach out, as she said: 'David\u2019s mum is friends with Ashley\u2019s mum, she (Victoria) was in my hotel room the whole time during the World Cup - we\u2019ve had barbecues together \u2014 so I was quite shocked by that'.\n\nWay back when: She later revealed she was disappointed when Victoria did not reach out, as she said: 'David\u2019s mum is friends with Ashley\u2019s mum, she (Victoria) was in my hotel room the whole time during the World Cup - we\u2019ve had barbecues together \u2014 so I was quite shocked by that'\n\nShocker: Rio Ferdinand and Fabio Capello (left and right) took issue with the WAGs (including Cheryl and Victoria, centre) after the Baden-Baden trip became 'a circus'\n\n'It was like a circus': The Baden-Baden WAGS Vs. Rio Ferdinand and Fabio Capello\n\nWhen then-England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson allowed the WAGs to attend the Baden-Baden World Cup, the focus became solely on the legion of wives and girlfriends and was taken away from the football.\n\nRio Ferdinand took issue with the press attention surrounding the WAGs, as he later said: 'If I'm honest, we became a bit of a circus in terms of the whole Wag situation. It seemed like there was a big show around the whole squad. It was like watching a theatre unfolding and football almost became a secondary element to the main event...\n\n'People were worrying more about what people were wearing and where they were going out, rather than the England football team. That then transposed itself into the team. That's said in hindsight...\n\n'At the time, we were caught up in the bubble ourselves. Being somewhere like Baden-Baden, walking around the town, there were paparazzi everywhere, our families were there. When you step back and look back at that, it was like a circus.'\n\nBy the time the 2010 World Cup swung by, new England boss Fabio Capello BANNED the WAGs from attending for the entire duration of the games in South Africa.\n\nHe said: 'I like what we made here at training where the players stay together. When we are in South Africa the players need the wives, friends, the girls. One day after each game. We are there to play, not for a holiday.'\n\nShocker: The WAG-takeover of Baden-Baden caused huge stirs at the time (pictured, Vanessa Perroncel, Lisa Roughead, Micheala Henderson-Thynne, Elen Rivas and Carly Zucker, left-right)\n\nWar: In 2017, footballer Tom Williams' wife Nicola McLean (left) locked horns with Jamie O'Hara's ex-wife Danielle Lloyd (right) as she claimed they only wed so she could become a WAG\n\n'The biggest d***head in the whole entire world': Nicola McLean Vs. Danielle Lloyd\n\nIn 2017, footballer Tom Williams' wife Nicola McLean locked horns with Jamie O'Hara's then-wife Danielle Lloyd as she claimed they only wed so she could become a WAG.\n\nDuring an appearance on Celebrity Big Brother alongside Jamie, who split from Danielle in 2014 after two years of marriage, she said: 'I don't think any wives or girlfriends would call themselves WAGS, if they did I'd think they were the biggest d***head in the whole entire world.'\n\nTheir co-star Austin Armacost then reasoned: 'You must have met girls who - that was a goal - to become a WAG?' Not missing a beat, Nicola then referred to Danielle as she quipped: 'No, Jamie did and married one!'\n\nCollapsing in a fit of giggles, Jamie then pulled Nicola into him for a hug and shouted 'oh you f****er' as the other housemates watched on in shock.\n\nRaucous: The WAGs became the sole focus of press attention due to their raucous behaviour in 2006 (pictured Alex Curran , Joanne Beckham, Wayne's sister and Coleen)\n\nWhilst Nicola and Danielle used to be the best of friends, the pair fell out and were involved in a public spat just days before Nicola entered the CBB house. The drama kicked off when she appeared to take objection to Danielle naming her new pet Chihuahua 'Rocky' - which happens to be her son's name.\n\nNicola - who raises sons Striker and Rocky with her husband Tom Williams - seemed offended when Danielle posted several snaps of her new pup on Instagram last month, announcing his all too familiar moniker.\n\nWhile the former WAG's followers cooed over the dog's cuteness, Nicola posted a sarcastic sounding message alongside one of the pics. 'Great name might name my new addition Archie', she shared, referring to one of mum-of-three Danielle's kids' names.", "description": "In light of the explosive row, we take a look back at the most shocking feuds in the wonderful world of wives and girlfriends", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/14/19492990-0-image-a-109_1570627814408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
