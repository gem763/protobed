We can, however, help shape their response to it. Our new favorite example? Megan Fox says her son Noah loves dresses \u2014 she and husband Brian Austin Green encourage their 6-year-old passion for fashion. In fact, in the face of recent bullying, she\u2019s working on teaching the boy to be unwavering in his confidence. And judging by Noah\u2019s reaction to recent bullying, the mom-of-3 is doing a damn fine job.\n\nFox appeared on an episode of The Talk on Thursday, where she opened up to the co-hosts about how Noah is \u201creally into fashion.\u201d He doesn\u2019t shy away from wearing, well, whatever he wants, despite the fact some of his choices are met with narrow-mindedness. \u201cSometimes, he\u2019ll dress himself and he likes to wear dresses, sometimes,\u201d she said, revealing, \u201cAnd I send him to a really liberal, hippy school, but even there \u2014 here in California \u2014 he still has little boys going, \u2018Boys don\u2019t wear dresses,\u2019 or \u2018Boys don\u2019t wear pink.'\u201d\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nBut Fox and Green are committed to encouraging their son to be his authentic self. \u201cSo we\u2019re going through that now, where I\u2019m trying to teach him to be confident no matter what anyone else says,\u201d she said.\n\nThe couple \u2014 who also share sons Journey, 3, and Bodhi, 5 \u2014 seem to be on the right track, too. Fox shared that after Noah wore a dress to school earlier this week, she asked him once he got home how things went. His response? \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018Well, all the boys laughed when I came in, but I don\u2019t care, I love dresses too much.'\u201d Could we adore Noah\u2019s reaction any more? Doubtful.\n\nBy nurturing their son\u2019s passions, Fox and Green may even be fostering what could become a future career for Noah. In addition to dressing himself, the little boy sometimes creates sartorial sketches. \u201cHe designs, he draws outfits,\u201d Fox said. \u201cHe\u2019s very talented.\u201d\n\nUm, where\u2019s the waiting list for a Noah Green original? With parents as supportive as Fox and Green, we can\u2019t wait to see where this kid\u2019s talents lead.\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
