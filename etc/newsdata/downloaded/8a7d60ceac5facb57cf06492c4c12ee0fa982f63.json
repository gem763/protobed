REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/Pool\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition it might well fail but if he mixes it up with the Corbyn question in a general election he could succeed despite a majority being against a no-deal Brexit because some may fear a Corbyn premiership more,\u201d Blair said.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn \u201cshould see an election before Brexit is decided for the elephant trap it is,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson has pledged to deliver Brexit on October 31 whether he agrees a new deal with the European Union or not.\n\nOpposition lawmakers - and a contingent from Johnson\u2019s Conservatives from Tuesday - will try to legislate this week to stop the possibility of no-deal.\n\nJohnson has threatened to expel rebel Conservative lawmakers if they thwart his Brexit plans by voting with the opposition, a move that would eradicate his already slim majority and make his ability to govern very difficult.\n\nHe could then seek an election to break the deadlock.\n\nHouse of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has said rebel legislation would be considered a matter of confidence in the government.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the government to establish the confidence of the House of Commons and this is essentially a confidence matter: Who should control the legislative agenda, Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson?\u201d Rees-Mogg said.\n\nBlair said the Brexiteers were laying a trap, \u201cto seem as if pushed into an election, whilst actively preparing for one\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the Government tries to force an election now, Labour should vote against it,\u201d he said.\n\nAn election would be framed as a choice between Johnson delivering Brexit plus a populist Conservative programme or turning the country, its economy and security over to Corbyn and his small group of acolytes from the far left, Blair said.\n\nHe said the challenge of an election before Brexit had been decided was \u201cbrutally clear\u201d, and Corbyn\u2019s poll ratings did not indicate he could win.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is laying an election \"elephant trap\" for the opposition Labour Party that it should avoid, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair warned on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425362465&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810OG"}
