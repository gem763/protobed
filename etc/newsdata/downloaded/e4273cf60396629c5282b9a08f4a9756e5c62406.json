However, as the details of the deal became clear, NVDA gave back most of its gains. The question for investors is, what now?\n\nThanks to investments in data centers and AI, Nvidia stock could look interesting again. More\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock is up 43% for the year, but that doesn\u2019t tell the story. NVDA stock started the year down nearly 50% from its high in 2018. Since then, NVDA has bounced up over 50%, then down 30%, then up and down.\n\nThe trend looks positive, but not perfect. There have been higher lows, but the highs have not always been higher. In fact, Nvidia stock looks like it\u2019s settling into a range.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCan No News Be Good News for Nvidia Stock?\n\nOne reason for the price movement is the amount of news surrounding the stock. In March, the company picked up Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a customer for its data centers. The stock jumped about 30%.\n\nHowever, the ongoing trade war continues to weigh on the stock. It\u2019s hard to ignore a market that provides 44% of sales for Nvidia. And increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the gaming space is putting pressure on the company\u2019s margins.\n\nBut that\u2019s the way it is with semiconductor stocks. Every story (good or bad) will generate strongly positive and negative opinions. So, what will it take for Nvidia stock to break out?\n\nAll Eyes Are on the Earnings Report\n\nA potential catalyst for the stock will be a positive earnings report. NVDA is scheduled to report on November 14. Nvidia has posted a slight beat on earnings in each of the last three quarters. If the company can follow suit this quarter, it could support the $217 price target that at least one analyst has forecast.\n\nIn fact, two analysts have raised their price targets for NVDA. This price target announcement caused the stock to jump over 1% last week even before the announced trade truce.\n\nBetting Big on Data Centers\n\nIf nothing else, the trade truce may remove any obstacles China would put in place to prevent NVDA\u2019s acquisition of Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:MLNX). This deal, valued at $6.9 billion dollars, will allow NVDA to become a much larger player in the growing data center market. As InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon wrote last week, \u201cIn 2018 alone, companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon spent $152 billion on hardware and software for data centers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis firm RBC projects that Nvidia\u2019s data-center revenue could rise by 100% in the near term, with sustained growth in the high-double-digit percentage range.\n\nNvidia Is Well-Positioned in the AI Space\n\nFrom agriculture to self-driving cars, Nvidia has its hands in many applications for artificial intelligence. However, as the cryptocurrency crash showed, this is, and will continue to be, a volatile space.\n\nI wrote back in September that relying on AI may not be enough for Nvidia. The market bid up the stock in 2017 only to see those gains wiped out when the crypto bubble burst. It\u2019s likely the market will be far more cautious this time around.\n\nWhat to Make of NVDA Stock Right Now?\n\nFor all the ups and downs of this year, I believe the stock is probably priced right. The semiconductor sector is historically cyclical and volatile. And with the company looking at a loss of sales to China for the foreseeable future, there will be pressure on earnings. The company is still dominant in the gaming space, but the big growth for that sector will be coming with the release of new consoles next year.\n\nAny or all of these stories could turn out to provide a catalyst for NVDA stock. And some key technical indicators provide optimism. NVDA shares are above the 10-week moving average. And the 10-week moving average has moved above the 40-week line. Also, the company\u2019s relative strength line is starting to increase after lagging for the better part of a year.", "description": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was trending upward on Friday upon expectations of a partial trade deal.
