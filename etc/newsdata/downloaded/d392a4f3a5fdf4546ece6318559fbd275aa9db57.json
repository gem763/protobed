Apple TV+, the company\u2019s bid to ride the streaming television wave, is due in September.\n\nThe new services illustrate Apple\u2019s push to deepen its relationships with device buyers and create lasting revenue streams. Arcade, for its part, will cost $5 a month, with the company saying it will offer \u201cover 100\u201d games at launch and add more monthly.\n\nRead: Remember \u2018Candy Crush\u2019? Mobile Gaming Stocks Are Still Worth Playing\n\nThat $5 fee gets players access to a library of games with no ads or micropayments. New games and updates are included. That, along with a family-sharing feature that allows for six users, could appeal particularly to parents who don\u2019t like surprise credit card bills caused by kids who get carried away playing.\n\nOver time, Arcade\u2019s value will be determined by the breadth and quality of its game library. If a must-play game can\u2019t be found anywhere else, that\u2019ll be a draw, too. Many of the games, Apple says, will be exclusive to Arcade.\n\nBarron\u2019s saw some of the offerings, which players will access through the App Store, earlier this week. (In a neat feature, game progress saved on, for example, an iPhone will be recorded if you pick the same game up on an iPad.)\n\nThe moody puzzle adventure Where Cards Fall, looked and sounded impressive on an iPad. Players guide the protagonist through a dreamy landscape of thoughts and memories; its developers estimate six hours of playtime for those who plow through the story, or closer to 20 for those who eschew hints.\n\nHot Lava, a take on the childhood game in which the floor is\u2014that\u2019s right, hot lava\u2014is more visceral, with players running and jumping to avoid the bubbling red stuff. (It will also be available to PC gamers on Steam.) Its developers say a single playthrough might take 15 hours, but players who customize characters or try gamer-built levels could end up with hundreds.\n\nMeanwhile, other media outlets have also been checking out the product. Here\u2019s a selection of quotes from reviews Barron\u2019s has read:\n\n\u2022 \u201cAt launch, Arcade will likely be worth it for the handful of games I\u2019ve already played,\u201d Gizmodo\u2019s Alex Cranz wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ll undoubtedly last me for a few months of entertainment, and given they\u2019re only playable via a subscription, I\u2019ll be locked in for however long those games give me joy.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cOf the first batch of Apple Arcade games I\u2019ve tried, my two favorites...[are] both isometric 3-D games built around very analog ideas,\u201d Dan Ackerman wrote for CNET. \u201cWhere Cards Fall uses stacks of playing cards to solve puzzles, while Overland plays like a miniatures-on-a-map tabletop strategy game. Console gamers will take to Oceanhorn 2, a very convincing Zelda-like 3D adventure that could fit in on any current game console.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe power of these devices can vary quite a bit,\u201d Jeff Benjamin wrote for 9to5Mac. \u201cFor example, my 2019 MacBook Pro, while adequate for most casual computing tasks, definitely struggled when running games like Hot Lava at high settings. I imagine that such games running on modern iPad or iPhone hardware would perform better on those platforms.\u201d\n\nThe effect Arcade will have on the industry is hard to guess at present. Apple hasn\u2019t said much about its contracts with developers. It has said, however, that it is backing game development and won\u2019t compensate developers based on how much games are played or own the intellectual property.\n\nApple wants the product to cover all game types and genres, though a model that doesn\u2019t rely on one-time or micropayments could be particularly effective for games that are meant to be finished, or tell discrete stories, rather than to be played for years.\n\nArcade could pull some gamers away from the free-to-download, pay-for-perks industry\u2014but that is itself a growing industry that accounts for billions of dollars of revenue world-wide. Apple, which already benefits from that economy via App store payments, is going for an even bigger slice of that pie now.\n\nEmail David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.
