Recent events show that reality is stranger than fiction. Take this latest story about Planned Parenthood for example.\n\nIn 2011, the satirical website \"The Onion\" published a story titled \"Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex.\" Its opening lede read, \"Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday the grand opening of its long-planned $8 billion Abortionplex, a sprawling abortion facility that will allow the organization to terminate unborn lives with an efficiency never before thought possible.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, CBS news tweeted, \"Planned Parenthood is announcing the opening of a new mega-facility close to states where abortion access is restricted. The new clinic was built in secret in Illinois, near the Missouri border.\"\n\nThe entire purpose of this \"mega-facility\" is to, well as \"The Onion\" said, \"terminate unborn lives with an efficiency never before thought possible\" for women from states where abortion is heavily banned. The 18,000-square-foot building in Fairview Heights was constructed using a shell company so that legislators and citizens could not block its opening.\n\nAccording to CBS, since August 2018 Planned Parenthood has been building the facility in secret:\n\nColleen McNicholas, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said the facility was built in secret to avoid protestors and delays. Other Planned Parenthood projects had run into problems once the public realized the construction was for an abortion provider. In one instance, a communications company had refused to install telephone and data lines; in another, a cabinet maker never delivered an order, McNicholas said. In Birmingham, Alabama, protestors targeted Planned Parenthood's suppliers, flooding their social media accounts with fake negative reviews.\n\nHere's what McNicholas had to say about the project:\n\n\"We were really intentional and thoughtful about making sure that we were able to complete this project as expeditiously as possible because we saw the writing on the wall \u2014 patients need better access, so we wanted to get it open as quickly as we could,\" McNicholas told CBS.\n\nHere's what \"The Onion\" article said:\n\nDuring a press conference, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards told reporters that the new state-of-the-art fetus-killing facility located in the nation's heartland offers quick, easy, in-and-out abortions to all women, and represents a bold reinvention of the group's long-standing mission and values.\n\nThis facility by Planned Parenthood only exists to allow women to kill unborn babies. Planned Parenthood could open other locations in states with abortion bans exist, and simply not offer the procedure. But Illinois, as we have covered, recently signed a law establishing abortion as a \"fundamental right.\" The state even allows partial birth abortion, though it is still banned at the federal level. There are virtually no restrictions on abortion in the state. That is why the abortion giant chose it as their location for this monstrous facility. Planned Parenthood often argues their mission is not abortion, but women's health. This announcement shows this is anything but true. At this location, thousands if not millions, of babies will have their lives cut-short due progressive's belief that abortion is a \"fundamental right.\" It is truly evil that this is allowed.", "description": ".10/02/2019 11:30:07AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/198/a4e356e1-adac-401e-8d03-fb5cc0029277.png"}
