Leaving aside the music for the moment, Elton\u2019s public and maybe even private persona can be divided into two phases: first there was the raging drugs monster, as extravagantly talented as he was costumed. Now that he\u2019s sober, there\u2019s the more conservatively dressed, happily married elder statesman of British pop, a proper establishment figure, albeit one who\u2019s still unafraid to pick fights with everyone from Keith Richards (\u201ca monkey with arthritis\u201d) to Madonna (\u201clooks like a fairground stripper\u201d). Both eras have yielded a steady crop of outstanding Elton anecdotes, often retold by Elton himself, who, possessing the kind of self-knowledge few of his fame and wealth retain, tells his stories better than anyone else. Probably the most infamous of all is the one about the time he\u2019d been up for several days (this, clearly, was from the pre-sobriety era) when he decided something really needed to be sorted out. No, not his devastating drug addiction or his lack of sleep \u2013 the problem was the weather. So he called a chap in his office and told him to sort it out: \u201cIt\u2019s far too windy here, can you do something about it?\u201d\n\nSuch is the wealth of material he has to choose from, this story gets only a passing mention in his outrageously enjoyable autobiography: \u201cThis is obviously the ideal moment to state once and for all that this story is a complete urban myth. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t tell you that, because the story is completely true,\u201d he writes, with a self-deprecating shrug. And then he moves on to the next tale, which might be about the night he and John Lennon refused to answer the door to Andy Warhol because, as Lennon hissed to Elton: \u201cDo you want him coming in here taking photos when you\u2019ve got icicles of coke hanging out of your nose?\u201d Or it might be about the time Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone nearly came to blows over Princess Diana at one of his dinner parties. That he has celebrity anecdotes to burn is not a surprise. But the self-mocking tone is more unexpected from a musician so grand that at his 2014 wedding party he had one table dedicated solely to the Beatles and their families. Yet while his extraordinary talent justified his personal excesses, it is his self-awareness that has counterbalanced the narcissism and made him such a likable figure. This is, after all, the man who allowed his husband, David Furnish, to make a documentary about him and call it Tantrums and Tiaras.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of 12 Royal mail stamps issued as a tribute to the musical contribution of Elton John.

It\u2019s just Elton talking about Elton. It quickly becomes clear in Me that few people are more suited to the celebrity autobiography genre, given that he combines the most essential ingredients of the form. First, his life is still hilariously over the top (tabloid photos of Elton, dressed head to toe in Gucci, tootling about on his yacht with his similarly clad family have become as much of a signifier of summer to me as any number of swallows). Unlike other celebrities who act as if their position on the A-list is only provisional and they therefore mustn\u2019t break the rules of discretion among the famous, Elton cheerfully gossips about everyone from Bob Dylan (terrible at charades, FYI) to David Bowie (\u201cdon\u2019t know what [his] problem was\u201d) as if they were his neighbours in Pinner, where he grew up. He is Joan Collins mixed with Joan Rivers, and if anyone can think of a more delicious combination they are probably deeper than I am. Best of all, he remembers, if not everything, then certainly a lot \u2013 unlike that arthritic monkey, Keith Richards, whose poor ghostwriter, James Fox, \u201chad to do a little sleuthing\u201d to confirm the Rolling Stone\u2019s stories for Life, his 2010 memoir.\n\nElton has his own ghostwriter, of course \u2013 the \u201cauto\u201d in \u201ccelebrity autobiography\u201d is always a loose concept \u2013 in the form of Alexis Petridis, this paper\u2019s pop critic. Petridis has a journalist\u2019s eye for the comically absurd, such as Elton\u2019s predilection for sexual voyeurism competing with his innate tidiness (\u201cThey\u2019d end up having sex on the snooker table with me shouting, \u2018Make sure you don\u2019t come on the baize!\u2019 which tended to puncture the atmosphere a bit\u201d), and he makes sure there is a laugh out loud moment on pretty much every other page. This gives a pacy originality to what could have been a by-the-numbers celebrity tale: the miserable suburban childhood, the early musical failures, the sudden meteoric success, the sex, drugs and dodgy financial advisers, the eventual redemption through marriage, parenthood and activism. The book could also have easily tipped into self-parody, with Elton as a musical Zelig figure, witnessing, in turn, the death of 1960s pop, the emergence of 70s rock, the brief burst of punk, the rise of 90s hip-hop and rap. Alongside all this is the glorious triumph of the gay rights movement in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, handily embodied by Elton himself, a pop star who once barely understood his own sexuality, but can now bring his two sons with Furnish, born by a surrogate, up on stage with him in Las Vegas, and has raised almost half a billion dollars for Aids charities. But Petridis wisely keeps the focus on the personal over the sweeping cultural: Elton\u2019s immediate reaction to the Sex Pistols, for example, was not any cliched shock of the new, but rather delight in Johnny Rotten slagging off his friend and rival, Rod Stewart, on TV.\n\nElton makes fun of no one more than himself. He is utterly, astonishingly, hilariously self-lacerating\n\nBut credit really must go to Elton, whose extremely amusing voice very much drives the book. The most acclaimed celebrity memoirs of the past two decades have been thoughtful disquisitions on the weirdness of fame itself \u2013 Rupert Everett\u2019s autobiographies, and Feel, Chris Heath\u2019s book about Robbie Williams. Me is not like that, and the most Elton has to say about fame is it\u2019s a lot of fun, but probably not very good for you. His book is closer in spirit to David Niven\u2019s memoirs with their litany of namedrops \u2013 although Niven, as far as I know, never wrote a line like \u201cI sat around, wanking, in a dressing gown covered in my own puke.\u201d\n\nMe is its own original thing because Elton makes fun of no one more than himself. He is utterly, astonishingly, hilariously self-lacerating. A half-hearted suicide attempt at the height of his fame could have been played for drama; instead Elton merely asks: \u201cWhy was I behaving like such a twat?\u201d He sums up the experience of writing songs for The Lion King, which ultimately won him an Oscar, as: \u201cI was now writing a song about a warthog that farted a lot.\u201d And yes, Elton was also mystified by the hysteria over the version of \u201cCandle in the Wind\u201d he wrote for Diana\u2019s funeral.\n\nOne subject he has strikingly little interest in is his creation of a catalogue of music that is now a licence to print money. He is very sweet about his friendship with his longterm lyricist, Bernie Taupin, but the process of how they write their songs is dealt with in a single paragraph, which concludes: \u201cI can\u2019t explain it and I don\u2019t want to explain it.\u201d And yet there\u2019s no doubt his talent is miraculous. Some of his songs took as long to write as they do to listen to; in one morning he knocked off \u201cMona Lisas and Mad Hatters\u201d, \u201cAmy\u201d and \u201cRocket Man\u201d before breakfast.\n\nElton has never come across as an especially warm celebrity: too sharp tongued, too ridiculous. Neither quality is played down in his memoir. And yet his clear-eyed honesty and his ear for the comic line make him a deeply appealing memoirist. By the end of the book I felt only regret that I am unlikely to get an invitation to join him on his yacht, where I could listen to him recall the time he asked Yoko Ono what happened to that herd of cattle she and John Lennon once bought: \u201cYoko shrugged and said, \u2018Oh, I got rid of them.
