Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\nDeGeneres has long been a fierce advocate for LGBTQ rights, while Bush publicly opposed gay marriage and other rights for the queer community during his presidency.\n\nMany also consider Bush to be a war criminal. In 2003, his administration began a war based on the false claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The war led to an estimated 250,000 civilian deaths in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, according to a 2018 Brown University study. More than 4,200 U.S. troops also died in the war, per the Miller Center. The former president\u2019s supposed \u201cWar on Terror\u201d also cost the U.S. more than $5.6 trillion, according to Brown.\n\nIn recent years, the former president was instrumental in the confirmation of ultra-conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 even in the midst of numerous sexual assault and harassment allegations against the judge.\n\n\u201cJust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them,\u201d DeGeneres added. \u201cWhen I say be kind to one another, I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.\u201d\n\nIt was apparently a message that both Witherspoon and Bell could sign off on.\n\n\u201cThank you for this important reminder, Ellen!\u201d Witherspoon wrote on Twitter in regards to DeGeneres\u2019 sentiments on being kind.\n\nThank you for this important reminder, Ellen! \u201cI have friends who don\u2019t think the same things that i do. When I say be kind to one another , I don\u2019t mean be kind to the people who think the same way you do . I mean ..Be Kind to Everyone. \u201c https://t.co/nPUMljZpUi \u2014 Reese Witherspoon (@ReeseW) October 8, 2019\n\nBell shared a side-by-side photo of Bush and DeGeneres alongside the caption: \u201cShe\u2019s my [queen!] \u201d\n\nSoon after their posts were published, many people online criticized both Witherspoon and Bell for defending DeGeneres, calling their support a \u201cprivileged\u201d way of looking at the circumstances. In the comments of Bell\u2019s post people said they had \u201clost MAJOR respect\u201d for the actor, adding that, \u201cTolerance of intolerance is complicity\u201d and called the framing of DeGeneres\u2019 defense \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn opinion that intentionally oppresses or harms another life? NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. You\u2019re better than this,\u201d one commenter wrote to Bell.\n\n\u201cI think you need a new queen,\u201d wrote another.\n\nComments to Witherspoon on Twitter were also critical.\n\nThe privilege reaks. There are thousands of people in the middle east who don't get to be friends with people with \"different views\" because they're dead thanks to him.\n\nAnd he spent his presidency trying to strip away LGBT rights, so nah. This monologue is pure class privilege. \u2014 Sara I I I \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 (@sarac93) October 9, 2019\n\nI have to take issue with this, with all due respect. There's nothing wrong with being friends with people of different beliefs, but there IS something wrong with being friends with someone who has hurt you and your community without remorse or a change. \u2014 Neil Pople (@NeilPople) October 8, 2019\n\nAnother Rich Elitist \u2014 #GunnelsHasTheDammReceipts (@marthaelenabaez) October 9, 2019\n\nBelieving certain members of our society don\u2019t deserve the same rights as the rest because of their gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation isn\u2019t a difference of opinion, ladies. \u201cBeing kind\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we should smile politely while they work to take away our rights. \u2014 Kristen (@mediaperuana) October 8, 2019\n\nit is a privilege to be able to set aside the real life harm and oppression bc it does not affect you and befriend someone like that \u2014 jhaunay-amanie (@wrightmywayout) October 8, 2019\n\nI can be kind without being friends. \u2014 Frenchie Phuketup Fuqua (@kimikoko73) October 9, 2019\n\nthis reeks of privilege. there are people who literally want the death of other people or at least the denial of their basic human rights. expecting marginalized communities to babysit bigots\u2019 feelings, to \"bE kInD\" as tho we're disagreeing abt pineapple on pizza is so ignorant \u2014 Chaima \u2728 \u0634\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0621 (@kzabrekker) October 9, 2019", "description": "The two beloved actresses are being called \u201cprivileged\u201d for defending the talk show host over her controversial George W.
