The traffic. Enraged motorists. Torn-up highways. Not Jay Leno. The former \u201cTonight Show\u201d host claims cruising its streets is a major selling point of the city.\n\n\u201cYou have hundreds of miles to enjoy,\u201d said Mr. Leno, 69, adding that you can bask in sunshine with the top down or drive a mere 40 minutes to throw a snowball in the mountains.\n\nMr. Leno\u2019s fixation with wheels dates to his childhood in rural Massachusetts. By age 11 he\u2019d already learned to fix a lawn mower. So when someone dumped a Renault 4CV wagon beside the road, he and some friends tinkered until they got it running. \u201cWe\u2019d drive it around the backyard,\u201d he said. \u201cMom would watch out the kitchen window. Today they\u2018d call child services.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts What was the most surprising thing you learned from this interview?\n\nNow with decades of experience wrenching, he has a collection that\u2019s swelled to 187 cars and 163 motorcycles, which he rolls out on \u201cJay Leno\u2019s Garage,\u201d in its fifth season on CNBC.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Leno also realized that cars were a good place to rehearse his comedy act, which he still takes on the road more than 200 days a year. \u201cYou need a place to repeat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a quiet room where no one\u2019s judging you.\u201d\n\nMr. Leno spoke to us about how a comedian\u2019s mind works, the perks of riding shotgun and why he\u2019ll never relax.\n\nPASSING FANCIES Clockwise from far left: One of Jay Leno\u2019s favorite artists to listen to while driving; Emma Thompson in \u2018Late Night\u2019; a Renault 4CV; In-N-Out burger; Dale Carnegie Photo: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images, Getty Images, Alamy\n\nPeople told me: I was crazy to pay $800,000 for a 1994 McLaren F1. The last offer I got for it was $17.5 million. I don\u2019t know anything about stocks, but I collect stuff I like.\n\nI like cars: that were noble failures, cars that were built ahead of their time. I look at it as kinetic artwork.\n\nMy garage: also has a full auto shop like you\u2019d have at a car dealership. I\u2019ve got all sorts of metal shapers and equipment, CNC machines and 3-D printers so you can make just about any part, even fenders. I\u2019ve got guys that are experts who help me. I usually screw it up and then they\u2019ll fix it.\n\nWhen I drive, I listen to: a lot of Motown. I grew up in the 1960s, and I love Sam Cooke. But I also have a lot of really old cars that don\u2019t have radios.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I like more than: eating in a moving car. I\u2019m eating and going somewhere at the same time!\n\nI\u2019m not: the world\u2019s most exotic eater. I mostly believe that there are five food groups: chicken, pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs and steak. Being a comic means late nights and eating when restaurants are closed, so most of my meals get served by people in paper hats.\n\nI\u2019ve never: been on vacation in my life. If I get a gig in Shanghai, my wife can poke around and I go to work. Jerry Seinfeld and I talk about this all the time: What happens if we went on vacation and found out we liked it? As soon as I slack off, that\u2019s the beginning of the end.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t relax: I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll relax when I have my stroke. I\u2019ve got a pool I\u2019ve never been in. Well, I went in 28 years ago to fix the light.\n\nWhen I do unwind: I go to a movie. I don\u2019t like the superhero stuff, but I loved that Mindy Kaling movie \u201cLate Night\u201d with Emma Thompson. I thought it would do great [at the box office], but it flopped.\n\nI find long-form TV: so much better than movies. I like the British cop shows, like \u201cHappy Valley\u201d and \u201cBroadchurch,\u201d which I stream on Britbox and Acorn. The women on there don\u2019t look like Angie Dickinson. They can throw a punch.\n\nI put a projection room: in my house 25 years ago, but I modernized it into a TV room. You have to keep updating as equipment gets smaller. It has an adequate sound system\u2014I\u2019m pretty easy to please.\n\nI wear an Apple Watch, but: on stage, I don\u2019t want something sending me emails. So I wear an IWC Repeater that chimes on the hour, the half-hour and 15 minutes. I like that it\u2019s complicated\u2014a real engineering feat. I also have a Jaeger-LeCoultre Duom\u00e8tre Quanti\u00e8me Lunaire. People give me very nice watches as gifts.\n\nThe best gift I ever received was: a first-edition Samuel Johnson dictionary. I just find it fascinating. Whenever my wife and I have a disagreement, I show her the definition of wife as \u201cchattel\u201d and \u201cproperty of a husband\u201d and then she punches me in the face.\n\nOne book I\u2019d recommend is: \u201cThe Perfectionists\u201d by Simon Winchester. I enjoy biographies of engineers and people who\u2019ve built things. I like \u201cEquations of Motion\u201d by William Milliken. He wrote it at 96 and was alive at the time of the Wright Brothers. It\u2019s fascinating.\n\nLife is: not that hard. It\u2019s Dale Carnegie. Be honest. Accept your faults. Protect your troops.\n\nI always tell people that: you should marry the person you wish you could have been. That\u2019s a pretty good goal. The secret to a long marriage is realizing there\u2019s nothing really worth fighting about.\n\nI don\u2019t have much use for: grooming products. I\u2019m usually covered in transmission fluid.\n\nSome of the comedians I like today are: Nate Bargatze, Neal Brennan, John Mulaney, Bill Burr, Wanda Sykes and Dave Chappelle. I like people who are good wordsmiths. I\u2019m not shocked by bad language, I just get bored by it. To me it\u2019s more fun to come up with creative wordplay that conjures up a disgusting visual.\n\nInterviewing people taught me: to be a way better listener. Most people aren\u2019t really listening and have no idea how to carry on a conversation. They\u2019re waiting for people to stop talking so they can start. I\u2019m generally interested in what people have to say. I\u2019m not that interested in my side of the story.\n\nThe best comedy club in the world is: the Comedy and Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, Calif. I\u2019ve done stand-up there every Sunday since 1978. It\u2019s got a great mainstream audience\u2014the kind of place where you can work a little bit blue, but you don\u2019t have to be a gynecologist to follow the act.\n\nBeing a comedian is about: learning how to compartmentalize your brain. When you\u2019re doing stand-up, you might see a guy in the audience and then think of a joke about him while you\u2019re saying something else. But it appears so spontaneous.\n\nI work in a business: that\u2019s subjective. Some people think you suck, and some people think you\u2019re great. The problem is, they\u2019re both correct. But it\u2019s different with a car: When you take something that\u2019s broken and you make it run, no one can say you didn\u2019t fix it. I work at night in my head trying to say things, and in the day I work putting things together. It\u2019s a nice sense of balance.\n\n\u2014Edited from an interview by Marshall Heyman", "description": "For the \u2018Jay Leno\u2019s Garage\u2019 host, there\u2019s no time for trips, no room for boring cars and nothing like driving with a burger in his hand.", "authors": ["Marshall Heyman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107881/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
