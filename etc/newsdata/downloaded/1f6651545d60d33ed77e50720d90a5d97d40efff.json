A quarter of baby boomers expect to postpone retirement until age 70 or beyond, according to a report from the Insured Retirement Institute, and 8% don't think they'll ever retire.\n\nEven if you're doing everything you can to scrape together some cash to put toward your retirement fund, saving for the future isn't easy. The average American thinks retirement will cost around $1.7 million, a survey from Charles Schwab found, and one in 10 thinks they'll need at least $3 million to retire comfortably.\n\nAlthough it can be difficult to save for retirement, there are few things that may be making it harder than it should be. These mistakes may seem harmless at first glance, but they have the potential to derail your entire retirement plan.\n\nBroken piggy bank with coins falling out More\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\n1. Helping children with student loans rather than saving for retirement\n\nMore than half (53%) of parents say that helping their children pay for college is a bigger priority than saving for retirement, according to a survey from T. Rowe Price, and 68% are willing to delay retirement to help pay for college tuition.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with financially helping your kids if you can afford it, but putting your own financial needs on the back burner can potentially lead to disaster down the road. Saving for retirement isn't something that can be done overnight, or even over a decade or two. Unless you have thousands of dollars to put toward your retirement fund each month, you'll likely need to start saving several decades before you plan to retire.\n\nFor example, say you want to retire at age 70 with $800,000 saved. You're currently helping your kids pay for college, so you hold off on saving for retirement until age 45. To reach your goal, you'd need to save approximately $1,100 per month, assuming you're earning a 7% annual return on your investments. But if you'd started saving at age 30, you'd only need to save around $350 per month.\n\nIt can be tough to strike a balance when you have multiple financial priorities pulling your wallet in different directions. But the longer you wait to start saving for retirement, the more difficult it will be to catch up. That's not to say you can't help your children with college, but if you ever want to retire, you can't forget about your goals, too.\n\n2. Not paying off high-interest debt\n\nDebt in any form can be a strain on your budget, but high-interest debt in particular can wreak havoc on your financial health. Depending on how much debt you have, you could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest alone, and it could take years to pay off your debt completely.\n\nIn most cases, it's a good idea to start saving for retirement as early as you can. If you hold off on saving for years until your debt is completely paid off, you'll have to work significantly harder to save enough to retire. However, if you're saddled with loads of high-interest debt, you could be paying more in interest than you're earning on your investments. Especially if you have credit card debt (with some cards charging interest rates upwards of 20% per year), even a solid 7% to 8% rate of return on your investments may not outweigh what you're paying in interest.\n\nIn that scenario, it may be wise to pull as much cash together as possible and pay off your high-interest debt as quickly as you can. Begin with the debt with the highest interest rate (not necessarily the highest balance), and then work your way down. Once you're left with only lower-interest debt (like a mortgage or student loans), you'll likely be able to go back to saving for retirement.\n\nStory continues", "description": "You could be doing more harm than good when it comes to your savings.", "authors": ["Katie Brockman", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lV.exGrC_ss5mh699km5fg--~B/aD00NjY7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/3780a719398e9dd9a23d80d7c64a8985", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
