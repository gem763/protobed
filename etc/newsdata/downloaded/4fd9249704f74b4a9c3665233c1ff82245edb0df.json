We do also have some younger couples with kids who want to travel with their family,\u201d he explains.\n\nFor less than the cost of an inner city apartment in most cities, or cheaper than a family home in many regional areas, homeowners with the urge to own portable property can set themselves up in an expedition vehicle.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got three tiers, there are trucks that would be around the $350,000 mark, then your medium trucks would be around the $650,000 price and then obviously you\u2019ve got your custom-built one that can go up to that couple of million dollar mark,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd Mr Boswerger says the investment these buyers make is in the knowledge that they never have to check into a hotel, sit on a train or book into an AirBnb.\n\n\u201cPlenty of people take these overseas. You can roll on and roll off a boat; lock up the whole thing, because all your valuables are safe and protected. Just hand your truck over at the wharf and then you just fly over to wherever and meet your truck on the next continent and off you go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr you could even spend months, if not years just travelling around Australia. If you\u2019ve got a vehicle like one of these it allows you to comfortably go and see the whole country.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of having one of these trucks is that you don\u2019t have to pack up, or set up. When you get to a beautiful spot you just pull up, open the door, pull your chairs out and you\u2019re done,\u201d he says.", "description": "Aussies are choosing mobile homes with the lot so they can live on the road forever, and this one family is taking it to the next level, spending a whopping $2 million on their luxury van.", "authors": ["Kirsten Craze"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14003220/capi_91b3511074d19ed02ec55ad75b913564_11b92d297b4d4c27b6bf710ed149f05d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
