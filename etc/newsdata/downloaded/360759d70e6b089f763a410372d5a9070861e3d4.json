Absolutely loved it despite not being that good at platforms, or particularly liking them. I really enjoyed Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons as well, best \u00a33 I\u2019d spent in a long time, despite its short length I adored the time playing. Last Day Of June was another cracker I remember fondly this gen, along with Stardew Valley.\n\nI tend to buy quite a lot of them, even have an indie game folder on my PlayStation 4, probably one in every three games I buy will be an indie; Little Nightmares, Suicide Guy 1 and 2, and Crossing Souls (or Accounting+ and The Mervils if counting VR) being the last ones I bought with my own pennies, once I saw them all at a reasonable price.\n\nSaying that I\u2019m quite sad Sony stopped giving them away on PS Plus, as I played so many little gems I\u2019d never have played otherwise as they wouldn\u2019t have stood out enough for me to make a purchase, which is a real shame. The Deadly Tower Of Monsters definitely being one I\u2019d never have bought myself, but I ended up really enjoying it and getting the platinum for it. Portal Knights was great fun too, as was RiME, but sadly that kept crashing on me so I never got too far.\n\nThe saving grace I do have is that I\u2019ve got 50+ indie games in my library just waiting for me to get round to playing them, and I will one day and likely find some new favourites. I\u2019ll never stop buying indie games, although I know for sure I\u2019d buy many more if I saw them boxed in shops. I\u2019ll take a punt at under \u00a310 or so digitally, anything over and I\u2019m very wary considering they\u2019re not adding to my physical collection nor can they be traded in.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame the more \u2018casual\u2019 (I hate that term but I can\u2019t think of anything else to describe those that stick to Fortnite, Call Of Duty 17, etc.) don\u2019t give a chance to the games that don\u2019t have a huge marketing budget, or that don\u2019t have a massive development budget, but that\u2019s the world we live in unfortunately. Even high quality, big budget games with enormous advertising campaigns bomb now so there\u2019s little hope for the indies unless they\u2019re exceptionally good and word of mouth pulls them in \u2013 much like Celeste, Hollow Knight, Undertale, etc. did.\n\nLost-Sock-\n\nPS: As a sad note to the lad that wrote in about not buying games based on demos \u2013 I\u2019ll add MediEvil to my own list. I was really looking forward to the remake but after the woeful, buggy, and boring demo I\u2019ll not be bothering now, even at a budget price.
