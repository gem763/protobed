Good thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one to chime in:\n\nWe can confidently say that Mexico is never going to pay for a wall with Colorado. https://t.co/Jwniln1HFT \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a wall in Colorado... and Kansas is gonna pay for it\u201d https://t.co/1EDS36WBOl \u2014 Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) October 23, 2019\n\nSee?
