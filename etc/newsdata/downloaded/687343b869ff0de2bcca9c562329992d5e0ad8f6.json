The report said Trump acted to advance his personal political interests, and that White House officials intervened to \u201clock down\u201d evidence.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute \u2018a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or executive order\u2019 that \u2018does not include differences of opinion concerning public policy matters,\u2019 consistent with the definition of an \u2018urgent concern\u2019,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe identity of the whistleblower has not yet been made public.\n\nTrump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Democratic presidential front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to a summary of a July telephone call released by the Trump administration on Wednesday.\n\nAfter the whistleblower report was made public, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified to the committee. Despite comments by Trump and other Republicans, Maguire said there was no reason to believe the whistleblower was disloyal to the United States or a political hack.\n\n\u201cI believe the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout,\u201d he said, also referring to the national intelligence internal watchdog.\n\nAsked if there was any reason to doubt the whistleblower\u2019s patriotism, Maguire told lawmakers: \u201cAbsolutely not. ... I think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way.\u201d\n\nBut Maguire added that he did not think it was \u201cappropriate\u201d to publicly rebuke Trump\u2019s public attacks on the individual.\n\nMaguire testified about the document after refusing for weeks to share the report with Congress.\n\n\u201cI have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way in the matter that is before us today,\u201d Maguire told the committee.\n\nMaguire said he had not released the report out of concern for \u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d a legal doctrine involving certain executive branch communications.\n\n\u201cI am not familiar with any prior instances where a whistleblower complaint touched on such complicated and sensitive issues including executive privilege. I believe that this matter is unprecedented,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nHe said he did not know who the whistleblower was, but did not agree with accusations - cited in questioning by Democratic Representative Adam Schiff - that the person was politically motivated.\n\nSchiff, the committee chairman, grilled Maguire about why the whistleblower report was withheld. Trump, Schiff said, \u201chas betrayed his oath of office, betrayed his oath to defend our national security and betrayed his oath to defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes, a close Trump ally who is the committee\u2019s top Republican, blasted Democrats for pursuing the matter, and media reports about the call and whistleblower report,\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate the Democrats on their latest information warfare effort against the president,\u201d Nunes said sarcastically in his first remarks.\n\nSaying more than six White House officials had made contact about Trump\u2019s communication with Ukraine, the report cited concerns that efforts to put pressure on Ukraine \u201cpose risks to U.S. national security,\u201d undermining efforts \u201cto deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and accused Democrats of trying to destroy him politically.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire is sworn in to testifify before a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the handling of the whistleblower complaint in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2019.

House and Senate committee members had been allowed to read the complaint on Wednesday, when it was still classified, but only in secure rooms at the Capitol.\n\n\u201cThis complaint should never have been withheld from Congress. It exposed serious wrongdoing, and was found both urgent and credible by the Inspector General,\u201d Schiff said in a statement.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint concerns a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\nThe whistleblower report said Giuliani was a central figure in the alleged interference effort, and that Barr also seemed to be involved.\n\nAnd it said multiple U.S. officials said Ukrainian leaders were led to believe that Trump would only talk to Zelenskiy if the Ukrainian leader would \u201cplay ball.\u201d\n\nTrump denounced the report. \u201cTHE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR,\u201d Trump exclaimed on Twitter. \u201cSTICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!\u201d\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d No president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Democrats control the House and Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate.\n\nThe United States has been giving military aid to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The $391.5 million in aid at issue in the current controversy was approved by Congress to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nThe details of the July 25 call drew furious reactions from Democrats, who accused Trump of soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help to smear Biden, who has led in polls among Democratic candidates seeking to challenge the Republican president in the November 2020 election.\n\nThe call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of nearly $400 million in American military aid to Ukraine, which the administration only later released.", "description": "The top U.S. intelligence official said on Thursday that a whistleblower who filed a complaint concerning President Donald Trump has \"acted in good faith,\" testifying after a House panel released the individual's report that accused Trump of using his office to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434169650&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P19V", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
