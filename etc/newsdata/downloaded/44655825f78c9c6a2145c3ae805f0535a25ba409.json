(Oct. 15) AP, AP\n\nThough the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones may be the stars of the Made by Google media event in New York City, a new and impressive smart speaker garnered quite a bit of chatter, too.\n\nNest Mini ($49), which is about the size of a doughnut, has some improved hardware and software to go up against its primary competitor, Amazon Echo Dot.\n\nThis diminutive smart speaker offers twice the bass as the original Google Home Mini, the company says. Indeed, the audio sounded fuller and louder than its predecessor when we cranked it up in a post-event demo session.\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL: Google's new phones have new color and tricks such as transcribing in real time\n\nFacebook Portal: How is Facebook's new device for privacy compared with Alexa?\n\nGoogle's new Nest Mini comes in sky blue, chalk, charcoal and coral. (Photo: Google Inc.)\n\nSounding off\n\nNest Mini was mounted to the wall, which is a new option, along with a new color, Sky blue, to add to the Chalk, Charcoal and Coral options.\n\nIf you listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks or other types of audio on Nest Mini, white LED lights will light up as your hand gets closer to the device, to show where to tap to adjust the volume (on each side) or pause (the center).\n\nGoogle says it improved the smart speaker\u2019s ability to hear you in noisy environments and dynamically adjust the volume based on any background noise detected. So you may hear your assistant say the score of a baseball game louder than usual if it detects kids playing nearby, for example.\n\nGoogle's new Nest Mini can be mounted to the wall, which is a new option. (Photo: Google Inc.)\n\nWhole home audio\n\nThough you can use Nest Mini as a standalone speaker, you can wirelessly connect it to any other Nest speakers in the home to work in concert with one another (pardon the pun).\n\nAs long as the devices are on the same Wi-Fi network, you can create a group with a Google or Nest smart speaker or display, to have them all play the same audio, or you use the \u201cstream transfer\u201d feature, which lets you move audio from one speaker to another (starting a podcast in the kitchen, then continuing it in the bedroom).\n\nSpeaking of audio, all Google Home and Nest speakers let you call devices from the Google Duo app (on, say, a smartphone). Or use the intercom speaker to talk from device to device, for free, to anywhere in the world (as Amazon lets you do with Alexa-powered devices).\n\nOther features\n\nA few other newsworthy features of the new Nest Mini:\n\nGoogle Assistant is much faster, thanks to an embedded chip on the device, which learns what commands you ask often and dishes quicker responses (previously, all questions and commands had to be uploaded to Google\u2019s servers to process the request).\n\nThe fabric covering Nest Mini is made from 100% recycled plastic bottles. Google says a single half-liter plastic bottle makes enough fabric to cover more than two Nest Mini devices.\n\nThe optional Nest Aware service \u2013 which includes all cameras, speakers and displays in your home for one price (starting at $6/month) \u2013 has an interesting opt-in feature. Should your Nest Mini (or other Nest speaker or display) hear a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm, it could immediately send an alert to your phone. You then have the option to hear the audio clip or listen live to confirm the alarm, and even call 911 emergency services closest to your home (yes, even if you\u2019re away).\n\nPreorders are available, but Nest Mini won\u2019t debut on store shelves until Oct. 22, at Best Buy, Walmart, Target and other retailers.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.
