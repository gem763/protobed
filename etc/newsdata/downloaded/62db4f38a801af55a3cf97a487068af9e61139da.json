Midday yesterday, the North Carolina legislature\u2019s lower house voted to override Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s budget veto, helped in part by some missing Democrats on the floor. Where were those representatives? Here\u2019s what the Post initially reported:\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans overrode a budget veto while Democrats were at a 9/11 ceremony https://t.co/b6kvApZaqn \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) September 11, 2019\n\nHow many North Carolina House Democrats were at a 9/11 ceremony at the time? Er \u2026 one, as the Raleigh News-Observer reported, as well as Cooper himself, who obviously doesn\u2019t get a vote:\n\nSome headlines suggested that Democrats were at events commemorating the 9/11 attacks \u2014 the vote was taken at roughly the same time as the national moment of silence. But The News & Observer has confirmed only two Democrats attended 9/11 events. One was Cooper, who spoke at the North Carolina National Guard\u2019s Sept. 11 commemoration in Raleigh. The other was Rep. Garland Pierce, a Scotland County Democrat, who says he attended an event in Raeford.\n\nWhere were the other Democrats? No one knows, but they weren\u2019t tied up at memorial events. They accused Republicans of breaking the rules, but the News-Observer reports that the GOP did not break any rules in holding the vote \u2014 and that vote had been telegraphed for a while. Republicans had been listing the override on the daily calendar every day, including yesterday.\n\nMaybe Democrats should have shown up to work.\n\nAfter reporting initially and erroneously that Republicans held the vote while Democrats attended 9/11 memorial services, the Washington Post corrected their article. Kidding! They just tweaked it to maintain the same criticism while avoiding the fact that it no longer applied:\n\nWhile most North Carolinians were remembering the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001, the Republican leaders in the General Assembly took advantage of a half-empty House and voted to override the governor\u2019s budget veto Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cMost North Carolinians,\u201d perhaps, but only one House Democrat. That showed up much farther into the amended report:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Darren Jackson (D) said he told his caucus members that they did not need to be in attendance and that state Rep. David Lewis (R), chairman of the Rules, Calendar and Operations Committee, gave Jackson his word that there would be no votes, according to the News & Observer. Republican leaders denied giving any such assurance. The Associated Press reported that the office of Republican Speaker Tim Moore provided audio from Tuesday\u2019s floor session of Lewis saying that recorded votes would happen Wednesday. Republicans also disputed the claim by the governor and other Democrats that many of them were attending events remembering 9/11 victims and first responders. Local news reports said only one or two Democrats claimed to have been attending a 9/11 memorial at the time of the vote.\n\nLet\u2019s recap. First the Post gets the story entirely wrong by claiming that the caucus was all attending memorial events, only to find that only one Democrat was busy at a memorial. Then the AP produces audio from the previous session warning that the assembly would hold votes on Wednesday. Shouldn\u2019t this warrant a full retraction?\n\nMaybe from newspapers interested in dealing with the facts. In the Post\u2019s case, all readers got was a \u201cclarification\u201d along with its deceptive re-editing:\n\nClarification: An earlier version of this article overly generalized the reason for Democrats\u2019 absence from the General Assembly session. This version has been updated.\n\nThe Post didn\u2019t just \u201coverly generalize\u201d what happened. It flat-out got it wrong, because its reporters just repeated the Democrats\u2019 allegations without checking with other reporters or even the other Republicans to find out the facts. And now, even when presented with the facts, the Washington Post is still spinning for the Democrats rather than just admitting to getting caught with their pants down.\n\nBut hey, democracy dies in darkness, or something.", "description": "\"Overly generalized\"?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/facepalm-newspaper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
