The Gap brand saw its same-store sales dive 7% in the second quarter, held back by MIA (missing in action) store traffic and high levels of discounts. Gap was also hampered by a decision out of management to shift marketing dollars to the fall shopping season.\n\nSo in short, people really REALLY forgot that the Gap brand even exists.\n\nGap\u2019s same-store sales \u2014 a key retail measure that assesses whether people are actually shopping at your store \u2014 has tanked in nine of the last 10 quarters, according to Bloomberg data. That\u2019s awful. But again, not surprising as Gap has continued to deal with stagnant styles and poor fits once more in 2018.\n\n\u201cWhile the comp sales at Gap brand this quarter were unsatisfactory, this is a brand that remains powerful and relevant,\u201d Gap CEO Art Peck told analysts on a conference call. It\u2019s a line from Peck that has become the norm on these earnings calls. If the Gap brand was powerful and relevant, per Peck\u2019s consistent claims, sales wouldn\u2019t be falling apart at the seams dating back five years.\n\nNone of it is normal for a retailer. Why the bottom line hasn\u2019t completely fallen apart you ask? Gap has moved to shore up profitability by closing hundreds of underperforming stores this past year, while the Old Navy division subsidizes the Gap brands numerous missteps.\n\nGap\u2019s second-quarter adjusted earnings came in at 63 cents versus analyst forecasts for 53 cents. Overall same-store sales fell 4%, worser than estimates for a 3.1% drop.\n\nSame-store sales fell in all three divisions, even the relatively strong Old Navy division.\n\n\u201c2Q was tough, and we knew it was off to a rocky start given May weather was not great. Challenging traffic trends have persisted into 3Q as well,\u201d wrote Jefferies analyst Randy Konik in the note.\n\nOld Navy is Gap\u2019s only bright spot\n\nOld Navy shoppers leave an Old Navy store in Redwood City, Calif. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) More\n\nThe only thing Gap investors have to look forward to is the spinoff of Old Navy in 2020. More details are expected to be shared at a September investor day in New York City. Konik believes Old Navy is the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the portfolio \u2014 he is on the mark.\n\nUnfortunately, the namesake Gap brand is anything but a jewel \u2014 which makes its survivability beyond 2020 as a stand-alone company a serious question mark. Old Navy won\u2019t be around to put a Band-Aid over the core issues (a lack of relevancy in the marketplace). Unless Gap starts serving Beyond Meat sandwiches and White Claw hard seltzer at all of its stores the message is clear \u2014Gap won\u2019t be around to celebrate its 100th birthday.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
