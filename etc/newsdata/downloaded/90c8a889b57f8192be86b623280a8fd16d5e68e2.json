If you\u2019re a big strong lunk, you can drink a lot of caffeine and power through,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cConsumers appear to have the wherewithal and the willingness to keep spending,\u201d said Karen Dynan, a former U.S. Treasury official who is now a non-resident senior fellow at Peterson.\n\n\u201cWealth is up, including in the middle and lower part\u201d of distribution tables, she added.\n\nInstead of a major downturn, Dynan is forecasting a \u201cmoderation\u201d in annual U.S. economic growth to around 1.8% in 2020, she said.\n\nMany analyst point to the flat or negative yield curve in the bond market as a signal of recession.\n\nLooking at a wider array of variables, including the yield curve, Dynan said the recession probabilities are on the order of 30%-40%.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about double the odds of a recession in a normal year but certainly not telling us that the economy is on the brink of crashing,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve\u2019s tools to fight a recession are limited, fiscal policy has ample room to help, she said.\n\nDynan estimated Congress could enact a fiscal spending measure totalling around $1.6 trillion to pull the economy out of a ditch.\n\nThat\u2019s about double the size of the fiscal stimulus put in place to fight the Great Recession in early 2009.\n\nCurrently the federal budget deficit for 2019 is estimated at $984 billion, a hefty 4.7 percent of gross domestic product and the highest since 2012, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.", "description": "A U.S. recession isn\u2019t inevitable, even though the trade war with China is hurting economic growth, according to economists at the Peterson Institute for...", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ491_Cr_gym_ZG_20190830120322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
