It\u2019s no surprise, really, that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embraced Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg as she arrived in New York.\n\nMiss Thunberg sailed into lower Manhattan on a 60-foot zero carbon-emission yacht. She received a celebrity\u2019s welcome, as the precocious poster child of radical environmental leftists. She didn\u2019t fly to New York as regular people do, you see because flying makes too large of a carbon footprint. In Sweden, the \u201cflygskam\u201d, or \u201cflight-shame\u201d movement is the latest big thing.\n\nGreta received a hero\u2019s welcome Wednesday after she and her entourage sailed into lower Manhattan on a 60-foot zero-carbon yacht, opting to sail the Atlantic for two weeks rather than fly to avoid contributing to carbon emissions. \u201cIt is insane that a 16-year-old would have to cross the Atlantic Ocean to make a stand,\u201d she told the cheering crowd that greeted her at the marina. \u201cThe climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis, the biggest crisis that humanity has ever faced.\u201d\n\nThe sixteen-year-old girl left Plymouth, England, on August 14 with her fellow passengers, including her father. The yacht is all tricked-out with solar panels and underwater turbines that produce electricity onboard. It\u2019s not a fancy yacht, though, according to the teenager. There are no toilets or showers and they ate freeze-dried food.\n\nI agree with her \u2013 it is insane that she chose to take the action she did. I also think it is insane that grown adults are looking to a 16-year-old girl as their environmental Yoda. She is clearly devoted to the subject of climate change and that\u2019s fine but this is a time in her life for studying and learning, not lecturing anyone who will listen as though she is the top authority on the subject.\n\nGod love her, Greta is mentally ill. For whatever reason, she was exposed to the subject of climate change at the tender age of eight years of age and it broke her. She is obsessed with the subject and hasn\u2019t recovered from her initial exposure to it. It sure looks like child abuse to exploit this teenager in the name of promoting a political agenda.\n\nOne reason for the attention is her compelling backstory. She first learned of climate change at school when she was 8. Three years later, she became depressed, stopped talking and stopped eating. She was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s, obsessive-compulsive disorder and selective mutism.\n\nThunberg is in New York to attend a protest in front of the United Nations Friday. She also plans to attend next month\u2019s United Nations Climate Action Summit.\n\nThe media love her.\n\nTeenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg has completed her sailboat trip across the Atlantic to attend a UN global warming conference. Thunberg says she took the wind and solar-powered yacht because flying is bad for the environment. pic.twitter.com/qHfBLEprgU \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) August 29, 2019\n\nWATCH: Teen activist Greta Thunberg arrives in New York Harbor after sailing across the Atlantic in a zero-emissions yacht https://t.co/EHRI9qsgb8 pic.twitter.com/ZtCG3f2QhY \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) August 28, 2019\n\nIn June, AOC reached out to Greta and did a video conference with her. Asking why the teen isn\u2019t just so depressed that she can\u2019t get up off her couch while she waits for the inevitable apocalypse, Thunberg pointed out that she is suffering from depression over the subject but that is why she began her claim to fame \u2013 school strikes. She began a movement in Sweden that expanded into Europe that encourages students to skip school on Fridays in the name of protesting climate change. I call it good old fashioned playing hooky, but your mileage may vary. I wrote about this in March because her #FridaysForFuture campaign earned her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. No, really. During that video chat, AOC promised her a \u201cQueens welcome\u201d when she made it to NYC.\n\nWelcome, Greta! We are so proud of you! \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 29, 2019\n\nAs you can see in this photo, the yacht bears the logo of United Nations Climate Change \u2013 Global Climate Action.\n\nNow we sail up the Hudson River to North Cove Marina. Thank you to all that greeted us on the water!! pic.twitter.com/uDl9WMdOL1 \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 28, 2019\n\nThe U.N. sent out boats to greet her.\n\nThe @UN has sent out one boat for each of the 17 sustainable development goal to greet us! Thank you! pic.twitter.com/AU5ZSVj5vD \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 28, 2019\n\nWhat she isn\u2019t talking about, though, is the fact that any benefits from her publicity-seeking stunt to use the yacht as transportation are negated by the fact that a two-man sailing crew had to be flown across the Atlantic to bring the yacht back to England.\n\nA spokeswoman for Team Malizia said it\u2019ll be necessary to fly the crew to the U.S. because the high-profile trip with the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner that left Plymouth on Wednesday was arranged at very short notice. Holly Cova told The Associated Press by email Friday that \u201cwe only have one boat, so they cannot easily sail over to meet them.\u201d Cova said the team recognizes it\u2019s \u201can imperfect solution\u201d but believes offsetting the emissions by funding carbon-reducing projects elsewhere \u201cis better than doing nothing.\u201d\n\nOh. It was really just a feel-good gesture after all. We already knew that, though, didn\u2019t we?", "description": "Peas in a pod", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoc.jpg"}
