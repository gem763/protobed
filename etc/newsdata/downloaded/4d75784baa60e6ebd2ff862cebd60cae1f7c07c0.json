He did talk about Joe Biden and his son and possible corruption and expressed some concerns about wanting the Ukrainian president to look into that.\"\n\nWallace then pointed to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway's remarks on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday morning confirming the report that Trump had asked Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to halt military aid to Ukraine prior to that July phone call.\n\nCOMEY SAYS HE HOPES CONGRESS DOESN'T IMPEACH TRUMP: IT LETS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 'OFF THE HOOK'\n\n\u201cTwo parts of the basic story here -- that the president wanted Biden investigated, and that he had previously stopped aid that had been approved by Congress for Ukraine -- that those have been confirmed by the administration,\" Wallace continued.\n\n\"It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call. So, there\u2019s going to be something here for Congress to investigate. Whether it ends up rising to the levels of articles of impeachment, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "\"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Chris Wallace weighed in on the formal impeachment inquiry being launched against President Trump, insisting that the ongoing controversy surrounding his communications with Ukraine puts \"a lot of meat on the bones\" for House Democrats.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
