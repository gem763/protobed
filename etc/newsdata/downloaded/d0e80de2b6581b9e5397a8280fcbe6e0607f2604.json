I know it is on the dirt but it is impressive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they ran the international races on the dirt he would win. The three runs I have given him, he\u2019s looked the winner at the 300m every time, he just hasn\u2019t gone through with it, he\u2019s cantered up.\n\n\u201cI thought we would give it a try and see how we go, we can switch him to a mile very easily.\u201d\n\nFellow Australian Blake Shinn will ride John Size\u2019s returning Group One sprinter Ivictory in the race after riding Pakistan Star in his first trial this season.\n\nShinn told O\u2019Sullivan of his decision on Thursday morning, opening the door for Purton to ride.\n\nIvictory and last week\u2019s Group Three winner Full Of Beauty shape to be the only Size-trained horses in the race.\n\nJockey Joao Moreira had previously indicated to the Post he was likely to ride Full Of Beauty in the race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to say right now, what I can say is people shouldn\u2019t be surprised if I do stick with him because he did win,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI will be looking at the options, what John Size has in the race, he probably has some of the best sprinters and we will see which ones will be ready to race in the up and coming race.\u201d", "description": "Champion jockey Zac Purton will ride one-time internet sensation and two-time Group One winner Pakistan Star....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/06/0b8eb286-e7f5-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293e_image_hires_132620.JPG?itok=ero8MOG4&v=1570339586", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
