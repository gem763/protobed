So Tiffany got thinking and when tagged on some zombie pictures on Facebook, had the idea to set one up.\n\nEnlisting the help of her other kids Kaiden and Gibson, Tiffany began preparing for the photoshoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a family effort as they helped Daniel and Oakley dress as zombies and snacked on gooey red velvet cake which doubled as intestines.\n\nTiffany told Metro.co.uk: \u2018The day of, Kaiden and myself started doing Daniel\u2019s makeup first.\n\n\u2018We hoped Oakley would just play while we worked on this. But just like a curious 11-month-old, she was right up in our business!\n\nShe\u2019s not even fussed (Picture: Tiffany Renfroe)\n\n\u2018So I would do some of Daniel\u2019s makeup, then smudge a little on her, do a little more of his and smudge again on her, brushes on him, brushes on her.\n\n\u2018She was even attempting to help with the makeup brushes! It was a game to her! About a two-hour game. It took patience but was fun.\u2019\n\nLittle Oakley really got into the part too, munching on intestines as her dad played dead. Daniel then changed into a Michael Myers costume and pretended to kidnap her.\n\nMum Tiffany added an effect to make it look like the toddler had contacts on (Picture: Tiffany Renfroe)\n\nOakley, whose photos were edited to look like she had contacts in, didn\u2019t look fussed.\n\n\u2018Although it was a \u201cdead\u201d shoot it was very much alive,\u2019 added Tiffany. \u2018With Kaiden and Gibson behind the scene helping, Oakley learning to stand by herself, all of us snacking on my props, mostly the red velvet, laughing and giggling at the faces Daniel and Oakley were making, exploring the woods, watching wildlife, and riding down country roads on our side by side.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mum-of-three said that\u2019s what families are all about, spending time with each other.\n\n\u2018Children need our time, they need us, they need laughs, giggles, hugs, and adventure,\u2019 she explains. \u2018That is what they will remember!\n\n\u2018They aren\u2019t going to remember eating cake and berries off of some fake intestines until I decide to share the photos at her wedding.\u2019\n\nHere are the rest of the images from the brilliant zombie shoot:\n\nDaniel got the daddy-daughter photoshoot he wanted (Picture: Tiffany Renfroe)\n\nHe\u2019s right behind you!
