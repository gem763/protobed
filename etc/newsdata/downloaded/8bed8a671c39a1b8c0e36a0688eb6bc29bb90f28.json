The flight was delayed for more than three hours.\n\nIt was previously delayed due to other technical issues but it eventually took off at 12.45 pm.\n\nHoney bees can be up to 15mm in length with queen bees measuring up to 20mm. Bees often swarm when a queen bee leaves her colony to find a new home with other worker bees.", "description": "An Air India flight was delayed on Sunday when a swarm of honey bees landed on the cockpit window, causing chaos before take-off.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xUlmslvWt8XEg3270PuDRA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/c1ae392c2003a222f14bfa26c345f914", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
