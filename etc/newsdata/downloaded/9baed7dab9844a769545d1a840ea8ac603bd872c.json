The State\u2019s total employment was 2.5 percent less than what it would have been without the law, and its GDP was reduced by an average of 2 percent a year between 2008 and 2015.\n\nThe legal brief attributes the data to a 2016 article in the Wall Street Journal, which was titled, \u201cThe Thorny Economics of Illegal Immigration.\u201d But the business groups hid the article\u2019s main conclusion: Fewer illegals ensure more pay for Americans:\n\nEconomists of opposing political views agree the state\u2019s economy took a hit when large numbers of illegal immigrants left for Mexico and other border states, following a broad crackdown. But they also say the reduced competition for low-skilled jobs was a boon for some native-born construction and agricultural workers who got jobs or raises, and that the departures also saved the state money on education and health care. Whether those gains are worth the economic pain is the crux of the [political] debate.\n\nDonald Trump won that political debate in 2016 when he was elected on a promise to cut illegal immigration and raise wages.\n\nThe 2016 WSJ article showed the pay gains for Americans in Arizona:\n\na worker shortage began surfacing in industries relying on immigrants, documented or not. Wages rose about 15% for Arizona farmworkers and about 10% for construction between 2010 and 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some employers say their need for workers has increased since then, leading them to boost wages more rapidly and crimping their ability to expand. \u2026 Carlos Avelar, a placement officer at Phoenix Job Corps, a federal job-training center, says graduates now often mull two or three jobs offers from construction firms and occasionally start at $14.65 an hour instead of $10. At DTR Landscape Development LLC, the firm\u2019s president, Dick Roberts, says he has increased his starting wage by 60% to $14.50 an hour because he is having trouble finding reliable workers. \u2026 [Farmer Rob Knorr] says mechanization is his future. He continues to pour time and money into a laser-guided device to remove stems from peppers, which pickers now do by hand in the field. Another farmer in the area developed a mechanical carrot harvester. Mr. Knorr says he is willing to pay $20 an hour to operators of harvesters and other machines, compared with about $13 an hour for field hands. He says he can hire skilled machinists at community colleges, so he can rely less on migrant labor. \u201cI can find skilled labor in the U.S.,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have to go to bed and worry about whether harvesting crews will show up.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s judges will host a brief public debate on the legal arguments on November 12.\n\nThe legal plea by business also claims that \u201cstudies have found that DACA has not had any significant effect on the wages of U.S.-born workers.\u201d That claim cites a 2018 report sponsored by a German group, which admits that DACA does cut Americans\u2019 salaries, although by a small margin:\n\nThe largest effects entail a 0.04% reduction in the wages of high school graduates (age group 2) and a 0.02 percent reduction in the wages of workers with some college (age groups 1 and 2). Column 3 aggregates these figures by education group, weighting each age-education group by their age shares by education (from column 2). The resulting figures show 0.01% drops in the wages of high-school graduates and individuals with some college, and practically zero effects on the wages of workers at the top and bottom of the education distribution.\n\nThe business groups want to block the higher pay that would be delivered by ending DACA. So their legal brief offers billions of dollars to governments if they agree to shortchange Americans, saying:\n\n\u2026 tax revenues will be reduced by approximately $90 billion, over the next decade \u2026 Dreamers and their households pay $5.7 billion in federal taxes and $3.1 billion in state and local taxes annually.24 In 41 states and the District of Columbia, the state and local tax contributions of Dreamers\u2019 households total more than $1 million annually; in 35 states, their contributions are more than $10 million; and in 12 states, they are more than $50 million.\n\nBut the WSJ article also showed how fewer illegals generate huge savings for taxpayers and governments;:\n\n\u2026government spending on immigrants fell. State and local officials don\u2019t track total spending on undocumented migrants or how many of their children attend public schools. But the number of students enrolled in intensive English courses in Arizona public schools fell from 150,000 in 2008 to 70,000 in 2012 and has remained constant since. Schooling 80,000 fewer students would save the state roughly $350 million a year, by one measure. During that same period, annual emergency-room spending on noncitizens fell 37% to $106 million, from $167 million. And between 2010 and 2014, the annual cost to state prisons of incarcerating noncitizens convicted of felonies fell 11% to $180 million, from $202 million.\n\nThe legal brief also claims that companies actually need the roughly 650,000 DACA illegal workers because employers simply cannot find Americans for unfilled jobs.\n\nThis \u2018can\u2019t-find-workers\u2019 claim is an example of \u201cFrozen Labor Fallacy.\u201d\n\nThe unspoken idea pretends that companies are somehow unable to hire any of the 160 million Americans who are already employed by other companies, even with offers of higher wages, more training, and better benefits. The legal plea claims:\n\nDACA recipients are filling vacancies at companies that otherwise would not be able to attract workers for open positions. \u2026 U.S. job creation has been outpacing supply. As a result, the U.S. unemployment rate is currently quite low, and the number of job openings is high. In June 2019, the U.S. had 7.4 million job openings, but only 6 million people looking for work. Sixty-four percent of small business owners reported hiring or trying to hire workers, but of those, 89 percent reported having \u201cfew or no \u2018qualified\u2019 applicants.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 Wall Street Journal article is based on an economic study by a Wall Street analyst, Mark Zandi. In 2016, he touted Hillary Clinton while warning that Donald Trump\u2019s policies would produce an economic nightmare of rising wages and cheaper houses:\n\nAs the immigrants leave, the already-tight labor market will get tighter, pushing up labor costs as employers struggle to fill the open job positions \u2026 Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies will thus result in \u2026 potentially severe labor shortages, and higher labor costs.\n\nNumerous establishment companies and groups signed the legal plea:\n\nThe Business Software Alliance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Hotel & Lodging Association, the Information Technology Industry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Retail Foundation, Amazon.com, Best Buy, Cisco Systems, Door Dash, Facebook, Google, IBM, Intel, Lyft, Marriott International, the Niskanen Center, Starbucks, Target, Uber, Verizon\n\nThe plea says:\n\nAt least 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients\u2014including IBM, Walmart, Apple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot, and Wells Fargo, among others\u2014as do many others, including Uber and Lyft.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook says DACA illegals are 'as American as any of us.' So Cook & his investor class peers claim the power to rewrite immigration law & create new Americans for work, consumption, and elections.\n\nBTW, progressives & estb. media are applauding. https://t.co/MIY1uBcwMd \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019\n\nThe business plea does offer a few legal reasons to support the DACA amnesty:\n\nThe rescission of DACA\u2014like all agency action\u2014 is subject to review under the APA unless it falls within one of two narrow exceptions: \u201c(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a). \u2026 The decision to rescind DACA rested on a legal determination: DHS\u2019s conclusion that the program exceeded the agency\u2019s statutory authority. Because that conclusion constituted a change in position\u2014the government had previously stated that DACA was lawful\u2014DHS was required to provide \u201ca reasoned explanation for the change\u201d in position.\n\nBut the vast majority of the plea is the demand by business that the judges supply them with more and cheaper workers:\n\nAt least 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients\u2014including IBM, Walmart, Apple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot, and Wells Fargo, among others\u2014as do many others, including Uber and Lyft.9 Those Dreamers also consume the goods produced and services provided by U.S. companies\u2014contributing to the growth of those companies and the economy as a whole. \u2026 If this Court permits the DACA rescission to take effect and thereby end Dreamers\u2019 work authorization, companies will face an estimated $6.3 billion in costs to replace Dreamers\u2014if they can even find new employees to fill the empty positions\n\nThe case is Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, No. 18-587. The judges may announce their decision by the end of June.\n\nCensus data shows how huge numbers of American software graduates have been replaced by Indian & Chinese visa-workers in N.J., California, N.C., Georgia, N.Y., Texas, Virginia, Florida, and other states. Next: Healthcare professionals. @S386 https://t.co/qH9p4Ynd34 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019\n\nImmigration Numbers:\n\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses \u2014 and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners, and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college educations.\n\nThe cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.\n\nThe labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings increase of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, to bring their median wages to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.", "description": "Americans will get wage increases if the Supreme Court ends the 'DACA\" amnesty, says a study cited by business groups who back the amnesty.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/Amnesty-for-DACA-Eric-BaradatAFPGetty-Images-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
