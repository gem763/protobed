Can\u2019t I have fun with that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But I will never apologise for it because I\u2019m very proud of the movie,\u2019 he added.\n\nThe new remarks came off the back of the announcement of a third Ghostbusters film, due to hit cinemas in 2020. It will feature many of the original 1984 cast members and will continue on from where the 1989 second installment (not the reboot in 2016) left off.\n\nDan Aykroyd, who featured in the original film, recently said: \u2018We\u2019ve got the Ghostbusters movie that we\u2019re working on now, and I will have to be performing in that.\u2019\n\nGhostbusters\u2019 Dan Aykroyd confirms he is returning for new sequel (Picture: Columbia Pictures/REX)\n\nHe added: \u2018It\u2019s really good. It\u2019ll be all, most of the original people. And then young stars\u2026 It\u2019s gonna be great.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so excited about it, and it\u2019s just wonderful to be able to [go] back and revisit that. I don\u2019t do the pictures anymore much, and I\u2019m in that one.\u2019\n\nAs well as Dan, Sigourney Weaver will also be returning for the upcoming film, and Dan says he \u2018hopes\u2019 Bill will sign on too.\n\nThe new \u2018young stars\u2019 will include Stranger Things\u2019 Finn Wolfhard and Captain Marvel\u2019s Mckenna Grace playing brother and sister characters.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
