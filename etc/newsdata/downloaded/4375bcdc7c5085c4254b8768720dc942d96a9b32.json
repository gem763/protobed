For the life of him, he told his staffers on Thursday between campaign stops in South Carolina, he could not process why journalists, let alone the public, saw this as a problem. He had meant well enough, Biden told aides. The campaign wouldn\u2019t dignify it with a proper statement.\n\nWhen it came time to do two previously scheduled interviews on the road, Biden stood defiant against any suggestion that he did, in fact, have his facts wrong. He told The Post and Courier of Charleston, S.C., that he had the \u201cessence of the story\u201d right. And he told a Washington Post podcast that he saw nothing wrong with his retelling, despite having misstated his role at the time, the military branch of the hero, the year it took place and what actually happened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the problem is. I mean, what is it that I said wrong?\u201d he asked the Post\u2018s Jonathan Capehart. (Biden, for his part, had also said he would not read the story.) After all, President Donald Trump has flubbed the facts more than 12,000 times, according to the Post\u2019s ongoing tally. Surely, Biden deserved some slack.\n\nThus is the state of the frontrunner for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination as the unofficial start of the fall campaign arrives this Labor Day weekend. The 76-year-old Biden, whose 1988 bid for the same nomination ended in a plagiarism scandal, is still having trouble mastering basic facts in stories that ostensibly star him.\n\nHe has already weathered one round of plagiarism charges in this campaign, brushed past complaints about his non-sexual physicality with friend and stranger alike and delivered two uneven debate performances. The ability to defeat Donald Trump \u2014 the centerpiece of his campaign rationale \u2014 has become less sturdy as polls indicate other candidates, too, could beat the incumbent in a hypothetical match up. Biden remains the polling leader, although nowhere near as comfortably as when he entered the race in April and then had a rally-style kick-off in May. The once-perceived inevitable nominee has been proven as fragile as his critics warned.\n\n2020 Democratic Presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren stand on stage during the Democratic presidential candidate debate in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., on Tuesday, July 30, 2019. | Anthony Lanzilote\u2014Bloomberg via Getty Images More\n\nWhich explains why, 22 weeks before Iowa hosts the lead-off caucuses, most of Biden\u2019s rivals are not forlorn. Elizabeth Warren is positioning herself \u2014 through an impressive political machine with few peers \u2014 to possibly win both Iowa and New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders knows the history, too; he and Warren both hail from states that border New Hampshire, and voters there have never passed on a chance to back a New Englander. In South Carolina, where six-in-10 Democratic primary voters are expected to be black, contenders like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro see potential. And then there\u2019s Pete Buttigieg, whose fundraising shows little sign of limitations; 300 people on payroll, including 70 in Iowa and 50 in New Hampshire.\n\nIn other words, the Labor Day campaign launch of the frenzied fall push comes at a moment of tremendous peril for Biden, potential for his rivals and promise for Democrats who, above all else, want to beat Trump. First, though, they have to settle among themselves who will get the chance to do so. And, at the moment, it is possible to see paths for most of the mainstream hopefuls.", "description": "Still, the fall campaign will certainly test Biden's advantages in the race", "authors": ["Philip Elliott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uqifAicWJsQOOK5pvWIBEQ--~B/aD00OTEyO3c9NzM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/19eeef725d4e8dd73dbaabd9e8556c35"}
