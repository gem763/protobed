The topics in this paperback compendium are obscure, but once discovered, terribly engrossing.\n\nThis reader sought additional information - about professional surfer Mark Foo, Mount Rainier and the Cascade Range, and the Khumbu Icefall on Mount Everest in the Himalayas - after reading various chapters, each an essay. Krakauer regaled with a scientific trio\u2019s exploration of Lechuguilla Cave in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico - reading about the long, roped descent into the cave\u2019s dark maw, its miles of narrow passageways and the objects of study, rock-eating microbes. I followed up by seeking images of this otherworldly, claustrophobic place online.\n\nWith each outdoorsy essay, I read before I researched what piqued my fancy. Krakauer\u2019s storytelling is so confident and engrossing, it begs for a reader\u2019s undivided attention. I found myself OK with sleepless nights; I could turn to \u201cClassic Krakauer\u201d once again to devour another essay or another few pages.\n\nMost of the essays are adventure-oriented, but there are a few exceptions. Of terrifying note is \u201cLoving Them to Death,\u201d about a Utah wilderness teen therapy program, originally published in Outside magazine in October 1995, that laid out several preventable teenagers\u2019 deaths and the trials that followed. It\u2019s the stuff of parental nightmares.\n\nThe rest of the stories lead to visions of near nightmares - of a bear attack, a rock-climbing fall. The morose fantasies this book churns up speak to what it really is - the perfect companion for armchair travelers. Don\u2019t want to visit the remote Brooks Range in northern Alaska? Let Krakauer go. He\u2019ll write about it. Wanna skip rock climbing atop a jagged peak in the North Cascades National Park in Washington state? Fine. We\u2019ll send Krakauer, then read about it.\n\nI enjoyed reading about the people, most of whom were quirky, and the places, most of which were dangerous. And I enjoyed doing this from the comfort of my warm, little home.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Classic Krakauer: Essays on Wilderness and Risk,\" Anchor Books, by Jon Krakauer", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jennifer Forker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/book_review_-_classic_krakauer_79029_c0-746-1556-1653_s1200x700.jpg?d18b00d8d13f8bd693f1d1a5bd56d305b5c7bd55", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
