So then we are left with simply cancelling Brexit \u2013 revoking Article 50.\n\n\"For Labour to embrace such a position, as some seem now to be inching towards, would be not just electorally suicidal, it would represent a profound rupture in our movement\u2019s democratic traditions,\u201d he wrote in a piece for HuffPost.\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson, who has entered her party's leadership race, welcomed the poll showing the Lib Dems could win a general election held tomorrow.\n\nShe said: \"There's clearly an appetite for the liberal values we stand for.\n\n\"There's a huge job to build and grow that wider liberal movement and that's what I'm determined to do and that's why I'm running to be leader of the Lib Dems.\"\n\nAsked if she could see a Lib Dem prime minister, Ms Swinson told Today: \"I think we should be very ambitious\".\n\nHowever YouGov's Chris Curtis warned the party against getting too carried away with the surge in support they have enjoyed since the European elections.\n\nHe said: \"The Cleggmania of 2010 faded fast, with the party falling back in the final weeks of the campaign and ending up with just 1 per cent more of the vote than they had won five years prior.\"\n\n:: YouGov surveyed 1,736 British adults on May 28-29.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn has been warned the\u00a0Labour\u00a0party could be wiped out unless\u00a0it comes up with a \"coherent\"\u00a0Brexit\u00a0stance as the pro-EU Liberal Democrats topped a shock new poll.
