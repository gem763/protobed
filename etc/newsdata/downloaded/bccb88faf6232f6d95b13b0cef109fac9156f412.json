Biden, a top political rival.\n\n\u201cI think we have to stay focused, as far as the public is concerned, on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said.\n\nMr. Trump has denied that he exerted undue influence.\n\n\u201cI had a simple and very \u2026 nice call with the new President of Ukraine, it could not have been better or more honorable, and the Fake News Media and Democrats, working as a team, have fraudulently made it look bad. It wasn\u2019t bad, it was very legal and very good. A continuing Witch Hunt!\u201d the president said on Twitter Friday morning.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
