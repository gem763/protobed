(Jaison Empson/CBC)\n\nOne of the events will be a presentation of 40 sacred eagle feathers for use in Manitoba courtrooms, as well as meetings with Indigenous, M\u00e9tis and French leaders.\n\nPeople can swear or affirm affidavits using an eagle feather \u2014 rather than swearing on the Bible \u2014 or they can hold it while giving testimony. A joint sitting of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Provincial Court of Manitoba will signal the acceptance of this Indigenous legal and cultural symbol in the justice system.\n\n\"That's being done purposefully to recognize that our system needs to change and that our system needs to be more inclusive,\" said Anita Southall, president of the Manitoba Law Society.\n\nSouthall also sees the value of Supreme Court justices interacting with those groups.\n\n\"It's getting out and meeting with ordinary people and and really hearing those views in a dynamic way. They do have to make decisions about societal change, policy issues, societal values and so to not engage and not be informed limits their ability to roll with that over time. Obviously in a measured way, obviously in accordance with the balancing of rights and the law,\" she said.\n\nDavid Harper, former grand chief of Manitoba's northern First Nations, says the Canadian justice system needs to do more to address longstanding imbalances that persist against Indigenous people. (Jaison Empson/CBC)\n\nThere has been a lot of frustration and tension in Manitoba and Saskatchewan following lower court decisions after the deaths of Tina Fontaine and Colten Boushie.\n\nIn 2018, a jury acquitted Raymond Cormier, 56, of second-degree murder in the death of Fontaine, an Indigenous 15-year-old whose 72-pound body was pulled from the Red River in 2014, wrapped in a duvet cover that was weighed down by rocks.\n\nJust weeks before that verdict, a rural Saskatchewan jury acquitted white farmer Gerald Stanley for the shooting death of Boushie, a 22-year-old Cree man.\n\nMany Indigenous people feel they are treated differently by the courts and that there's more than one level of justice in Canada, based on white privilege, said David Harper, a former grand chief of Manitoba's northern First Nations.\n\n\"There's three [levels of justice]. One is First Nations, one is not First Nations, and the other one is the government that holds all decisions, like who has the main decision-making power. So we need to balance that.\"\n\nMark Toews, past president of the Manitoba Bar Association, says the Supreme Court visit can raise public awareness about the highest court's role in society. (Jaison Empson/CBC)\n\nCeremonies and meetings this week may be a first step in achieving that, Toews said.\n\n\"There's more that can be done to address the injustice that continues to exist for certain communities. At the same time, there can also be an increased appreciation for what the Supreme Court actually does do on behalf of these communities,\" he said, ensuring the rule of law and that the Constitution is respected.\n\n\"It'll enhance their understanding but it will also be beneficial for the Supreme Court to have these discussions and these conversations with them.\"\n\nThere has never been an Indigenous Supreme Court justice.\n\n\"That's only a matter of time. I think we can look forward to that happening in the not-too-distant future,\" Toews said, adding he hopes this visit will spark the imagination of students who get a chance to meet the justices and experience the Supreme Court in person.\n\nOnly 10 women have been selected to serve Canada's highest court, compared to 79 men.", "description": "For the first time in its nearly 145-year history, the Supreme Court of Canada will hear two cases outside Ottawa.", "authors": ["National Reporter", "Karen Pauls Is An Award-Winning Journalist Who Has Been A National News Reporter In Manitoba Since She Has Travelled Across Canada", "Around The World To Do Stories For Cbc", "Including The Royal Wedding In London.
