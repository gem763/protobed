Thirty people died on site and one more died in hospital, the Health Ministry spokesman said.\n\nThe ministry did not disclose how they had been killed but shrine officials told Reuters the stampede took place towards the end of the procession, when thousands of pilgrims rushed towards the shrine during what is known as the Tuwairij run.\n\n\u201cThe pilgrims fell one on top of the other and we were unable to pull them out,\u201d pilgrim Abdel Mahdi told Reuters.\n\nPhotographs circulated on social media showed dozens of people bloodied and lying across a walkway, while other pilgrims attempted to help.\n\nPrime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi expressed his condolences to those killed in the stampede, while the Health Minister visited the wounded in hospital.\n\nThe annual pilgrimage marking the death of the Prophet Mohammed\u2019s grandson Hussein in battle in 680 draws hundreds of thousands of Shi\u2019ite Muslims to Kerbala from around the world.\n\nHussein\u2019s death in a battle at Kerbala over the leadership of the Islamic community is one of the defining events in the schism between Shi\u2019ite and Sunni Muslims.\n\nThe rituals commemorating the death of Hussein involve self-flagellation, with crowds of mourners striking themselves and some lacerating their heads with blades.
