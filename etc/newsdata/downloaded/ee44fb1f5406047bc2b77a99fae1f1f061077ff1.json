They made this mess themselves", "language": "en", "text": "It had to be done.\n\nEven for an organization as prestigious as the New England Patriots.\n\nEven for a franchise so fiercely focused on winning.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEven after 11 days.\n\nThe Patriots had no choice but to release Antonio Brown \u2014 not because of some crisis of conscious behind closed doors. But because Brown left them no choice.\n\nAs serious allegations against the receiver continued to mount, the distractions reached untenable proportions.\n\nNo longer could New England ignore Brown's off-field behavior.\n\nNo longer could it disregard allegations of rape, sexual misconduct and potentially threatening behavior.\n\nNo longer could coach Bill Belichick pretend that \"football questions\" are all that matter right now.\n\nThe final straw was the \"intimidating\" text messages Brown reportedly sent a woman who said she endured unwelcome sexual advances from him in 2017. Those texts \u2014 which were sent by Brown in a group chat that included the woman and his lawyer, according to Sports Illustrated \u2014 included a picture of her children and orders for her to be investigated.\n\n\"We appreciate the hard work of many people over the past 11 days,\" the Patriots said in a statement Friday afternoon. \"But we feel that it is best to move in a different direction at this time.\" But why did it even have to come to this?\n\nWin at all costs.\n\nThat is the true Patriot Way.\n\nAntonio Brown is looking for work again after getting cut on Friday by the Patriots. (AP)\n\nStory continues\n\nA collective cockiness and an unwavering commitment to assembling a formidable Super Bowl roster led the organization here: to take an unnecessary chance on a mercurial, unpredictable and troubled player who forced his way out of Pittsburgh, burned his feet in a cryotherapy mishap, engaged in a feud with the NFL over an outdated helmet, missed practice time with the Raiders, got into a verbal altercation with Oakland general manager Mike Mayock and recorded a conversation between him and his former head coach Jon Gruden.\n\nNone of that was enough to give the Pats pause.\n\nAll they saw was a seven-time Pro Bowler.\n\nAll they saw was a four-time All Pro.\n\nAll they saw was a versatile pass-catching threat who could make an explosive offense unstoppable.\n\nAnd they were right.\n\nBrown \u2014 who was signed on Sept. 7, just three days before a different woman, his former trainer, Britney Taylor, said he raped her in May 2018 \u2014 caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown in the Patriots' Week 2 blowout of the Miami Dolphins.\n\nFive days later, Brown was released.\n\n\"Thanks for the opportunity appreciate @Patriots,\" he wrote. \"The marathon continues.\"\n\nThe so-called \"Patriot Way\" was supposed to keep Brown in line. Keep him focused solely on football. Everyone assumed he'd adhere to the program, that he'd conduct himself as just another member of the 53. Just like quarterback Tom Brady. Meanwhile, Belichick thought he'd be able to steer the conversation toward football \u2014 just like on Friday morning, when he stormed out of a news conference after 3 1/2 minutes because there were too many questions about Brown and not enough inquiries about his next opponent: the New York Jets.\n\nBut Belichick brought this on himself.\n\nThe Patriots welcomed Brown and all of his baggage. For the sake of winning, they willingly allowed a troubled man to enter their inner sanctum. They forced their own players \u2014 Brady and veteran leaders, included \u2014 to answer questions daily about Brown and the circumstances that surround one of the league's most polarizing and problematic stars.\n\nThey tried to control the narrative with stern faces and clipped answers, but there was no escaping the drama that continue to follow Brown like an unrelenting smog. Belichick's latest news conference was proof of that.\n\nA team that despises distraction allowed this never-ending saga to continue at its doorstep.\n\nAnd all it took was 11 days for the Patriots to cut bait.\n\nNot because they wanted to.\n\nBut because, in the end, Brown gave them no choice.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The so-called \"Patriot Way\" was supposed to keep Antonio Brown in line.
