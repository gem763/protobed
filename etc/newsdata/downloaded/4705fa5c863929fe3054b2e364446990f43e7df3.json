In our view, the transcript contained at least a hint that Mr. Trump was linking the \u201cfavor\u201d he wanted to arms sales, and clear evidence that he was tying it to a White House invitation.\n\nThat conclusion is now confirmed. Text messages among U.S. diplomats and a Ukrainian official released by House committees definitively show that not only did the Trump administration seek to extract Ukrainian promises of political probes in exchange for a summit meeting, but also they spent weeks negotiating the deal both before and after the Trump-Zelensky phone call.\n\nThere was no lack of clarity on either side. \u201cHeard from the White House,\u201d U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker texted a top aide to Mr. Zelensky on July 25, just ahead of the call. \u201cAssuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/ \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for a visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nAbout two weeks later, amid negotiations over what, exactly, Mr. Zelensky would say in publicly announcing the probes, the aide, Andrey Yermak, texted Mr. Volker: \u201cI think it\u2019s possible to make this declaration and mention all these things. . . . But it will be logic to do after we receive a confirmation of date.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the deal did not go through. Instead, the record shows that Mr. Trump and his retainers kept raising their demands, like a casino developer squeezing a plumbing contractor.\n\nMr. Zelensky was supposed to get his meeting date after promising the investigations in the July 25 phone call. Instead, the Ukrainians were told Mr. Zelensky needed to make a public statement committing to the probes. Mr. Volker told Congress Thursday that when the Ukrainians then offered a general statement about fighting corruption, it was rejected by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said Mr. Zelensky had to refer specifically to allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and to the gas company that employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter. In the end, the Ukrainians \u2014 to their credit \u2014 refused.\n\nMeanwhile, the senior U.S. diplomat in Kiev, William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, had become concerned that not just a White House meeting but also U.S. military aid to Ukraine \u2014 which Mr. Trump had suspended \u2014 were linked to the demand for investigations. In an enigmatic text message on Sept. 8, Mr. Taylor referred to a \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario in which \u201cthey give the interview and don\u2019t get the security assistance.\u201d That sounds like a reference to yet another political trade-off, this time involving the $391 million in aid Mr. Trump was sitting on. The next day, the career diplomat texted: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nCongress clearly has more to learn here, from Mr. Taylor and others. As we have written, our information is that the White House was conditioning security assistance on Ukraine\u2019s promise to conduct the politically motivated investigations. But legislators already know this much: Mr. Trump literally used his office \u2014 in the form of a promised White House meeting \u2014 to induce a foreign leader to investigate a potential opponent in the 2020 election. That was a blatant act of corruption.", "description": "Text messages confirm quid-pro-quo talks between the Trump administration and Ukraine.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9JfnfKVHi3ULXc3PpnPxvrksb3Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P47J2EXFLAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
