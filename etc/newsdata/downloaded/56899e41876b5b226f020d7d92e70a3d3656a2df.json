Buttigieg has warned Democrats that identity politics and the ambitious domestic policy agenda of his rivals risk further tearing the country apart. \u201cOur country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now ... after everything we are about to go through,\u201d he said at the Democratic debate earlier this month.\n\n\n\nButtigieg\u2019s bold idea is really one of the oldest in politics. Like Barack Obama before him, he is selling a dream of \u201cunity,\u201d which is what makes him a recognizable, almost nostalgic figure to both establishment Democrats and the Obama-era operatives who now grace the green rooms of CNN and MSNBC. Never mind that Obama himself spent much of his administration being stymied by a Republican opposition that understood the politics of polarization better than he did, or that Obama\u2019s successor rose to power by questioning his American citizenship and playing the politics of division. In this hyper-partisan moment, \u201cunity\u201d is a curiously resilient aspiration\u2014one that lives on in large part thanks to the punditocracy.\n\n\n\nAs a trope, \u201cunity\u201d can look a lot like naked ideology masquerading as pragmatism. Writing about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s debate performance, for example, Slate\u2019s William Saletan wondered if the candidate\u2019s \u201cextremism\u201d will doom her candidacy\u2014unless, upon winning the nomination, she softens her position on Medicare for All and rebrands \u201cherself as a sensible progressive who can unite the country.\u201d It\u2019s odd how calls for unity so often coincide with calls for market-driven centrism.\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s the bad faith unity argument propagated by the right. Assessing the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential field, former George W. Bush strategist Karl Rove mused that \u201cit\u2019s difficult to unite a country while also accusing it of being led and dominated by white bigots.\u201d Here, unity is trotted out as a shield as part of Karl Rove\u2019s cynical effort to stop Democrats from pointing out the obvious fact that Donald Trump\u2019s party is really racist.\n\n", "description": "On an un-killable trope of campaign coverage", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d2b8ad9cc3e6078bf1f61fc12282eb6451fdcfad.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
