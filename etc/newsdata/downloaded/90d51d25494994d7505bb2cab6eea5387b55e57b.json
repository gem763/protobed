Amie, the baby and Leathem were left bloodied in the ordeal in August this year.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nSentencing Leathem to nine months in jail at Paisley Sheriff Court, Sheriff David Pender said: \"This is an appalling offence.\n\n\"To do this to your wife while she's carrying a child and is pregnant defies belief as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nThe court heard Leathem hurled homophobic insults and threats of violence at police officers as they arrested him and took him to the police station.\n\n\"I'll f****** end you, ya f****** p****! Get that c**k out your mouth. I've ended better than you,\" he told one officer in Erskine, near Glasgow.\n\n(Image: Single use only, no unathorised use or publication, not for syndication, Rory Cassidy, 07983467523.
