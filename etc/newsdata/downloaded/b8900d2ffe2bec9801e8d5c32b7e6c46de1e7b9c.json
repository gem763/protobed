Forecasters expect Dorian to move on Saturday over Nova Scotia, where the Canadian Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane warning for the eastern portion of the province.\n\nThe most frightening moments Friday morning occurred on Ocracoke Island, at the southern end of the Outer Banks. Donald Shumate, a spokesman for Hyde County, N.C., said the storm had brought a rapid rush of floodwater that had risen to seven feet, sending residents scurrying to their second floors and attics.\n\nSusie Fitch-Slater, 60, the pastor of Ocracoke United Methodist Church, was shocked by its speed. One moment, she said, she was looking at small puddles in her backyard. A moment later, she said, the entire yard was flooded. \u201cI am from the Outer Banks,\u201d she said. \u201cI was born here. And I have never seen anything like this before. I went into the attic, and I have never done that in my life. There was that moment when you wondered if it was ever going to stop. It\u2019s the most frightened I\u2019ve been, ever.\u201d", "description": "The blow to the Outer Banks, a 120-mile strand of narrow barrier islands off North Carolina that is a magnet for hurricanes, was a reminder of the menacing power the storm retained.", "authors": ["Campbell Robertson", "Richard Fausset", "Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/us/06vid-dorian/06vid-dorian-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
