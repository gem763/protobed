They are also referred to as Tier One forces and are tasked with special missions, such as the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden.\n\nDelta Force soldiers were among the first to engage ISIS after the terrorist group swept across Iraq in 2014. The first U.S. service member to be killed in the war against ISIS was Army Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler, who was a member of Delta Force, on October 22, 2015.\n\nRangers are the Army\u2019s premier light infantry forces, and the 160th SOAR is the Army\u2019s elite aviation unit specializing in nighttime raids, giving them the name \u201cNight Stalkers.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday praised the forces he authorized to conduct the raid but did not mention the units that took part in the operation.\n\n\u201cU.S. Special Operations Forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style. The U.S. personnel were incredible. I got to watch much of it,\u201d he said during a 48-minute live press conference.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper, who was in the Situation Room with the president as the operation unfolded, also praised the forces involved for \u201cflawlessly\u201d executing the operation in a statement and said earlier on ABC News\u2019 This Week that it was \u201cbrilliantly executed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur troops are the best in the world. They know what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ve done this hundreds of times and it was a brilliantly executed operation. And the president deserves credit for giving it the green light,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said there were less than a hundred forces on the ground but more involved in the entire operation, including from the intelligence community and other parts of the government.\n\nHe also confirmed there were a \u201cnumber\u201d of different types of aircraft, \u201cprincipally the CH-47s\u201d helicopters, which are Chinooks. The 160th SOAR operates modified Chinooks that can carry about two dozen forces each. The regiment also operates Black Hawk and Little Bird attack helicopters.\n\nEsper said some of the helicopters took fire but that U.S. forces returned fire in self-defense. He said U.S. forces also destroyed the compound where al-Baghdadi was found to be hiding once the U.S. forces left, but he did not say what kind of platform was used.\n\nTrump and Esper described a harrowing raid in which a number of adults were killed, including two of Baghdadi\u2019s wives who were allegedly wearing suicide vests that had not exploded and more adults and children taken into custody.\n\nAccording to Trump and Esper, U.S. forces, accompanied by military dogs, chased al-Baghdadi, who reportedly dragged three of his young children with him into a tunnel, which had a dead-end, and exploded his suicide vest, killing himself, his children, and collapsing the tunnel.\n\nEsper said U.S. forces chased al-Baghdadi to the tunnel but \u201cbefore we could get in there and get him he blew himself up.\u201d\n\nOne dog was injured but survived. Trump said the U.S. forces had a robot with them, but things moved too fast to be able to use it.\n\nHe declined to say whether U.S. forces had eyes on al-Baghdadi but said there was a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that he was in the tunnel, and it was subsequently verified through DNA evidence. U.S. forces also collected intelligence from the raid, having to do with ISIS \u201corigins, future plans, things that we very much want,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe said the raid took more than two hours.\n\nAl-Baghdadi died \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast. The tunnel had caved in on it, in addition. But test results gave certain immediate and totally positive identification. It was him,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEsper was not the only Army leader in the Situation Room with Trump. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley \u2014 who previously served as chief of staff of the Army, was also present.\n\nMilley himself spent time in Army special operations. He served with the Special Forces\u2019 5th Group as a Green Beret.\n\nDespite a report that some current and retired Army Special Forces were upset with Trump\u2019s press conference discussing the raid in such detail, several current and retired Special Forces sources praised the press conference to Breitbart News and dismissed criticism that the press conference revealed anything that would compromise future raids.\n\nRetired Green Beret Joe Kent, whose wife Navy Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent was killed by ISIS in Syria this year, tweeted:\n\n\u201cWhen my sons are old enough to know their mother was killed hunting evil it will be an honor to tell them America\u2019s silent warriors relentlessly hunted & destroyed it to avenge her & so many. Thank you brothers & sisters,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nWhen my sons are old enough to know their mother was killed hunting evil it will be an honor to tell them America\u2019s silent warriors relentlessly hunted & destroyed it to avenge her & so many. Thank you brothers & sisters. \u2014 joe kent (@joekent16jan19) October 27, 2019\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Elite U.S. Army special operators took out the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria's (ISIS) head honcho, sources confirmed to Breitbart News.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/05/ISIS-flag-Islamic-State-flag-Syria-640x480-AFP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
