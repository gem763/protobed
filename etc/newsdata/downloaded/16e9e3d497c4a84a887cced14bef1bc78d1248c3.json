In SA, officials have expressed the goal to increase that number to half a million annually.\n\nAccording to the department of tourism, as part of the deal, Tencent will also assist SA Tourism with knowledge transfer programmes on best practices for destination development, and advise on how South Africa can accelerate the implementation of WeChat Pay for Chinese travellers.\n\nTencent will further advise SA Tourism on best practice for Chinese visitor experiences, and making use of QR codes.\n\n* Fin24's parent company Media24 is part of the Naspers Group.
