The younger the workers, the fewer hours they work, though old habits seems to die hard among older office drudges.\n\nStatistics Korea released the findings last week based on mobile data on the movements of office workers in the Seoul metropolitan and surrounding areas. Statistics Korea analyzed SK Telecom and KT mobile big data from November 2017 on the movements of 1.16 million workers between 25 and 55 in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province.\n\nIt showed that workers in their 50s slaved the longest at 10 hours and 42 minutes a day, followed by those in their 40s with 10 hours and 30 minutes, those in their 30s with 10 hours and 24 minutes and those in their 20 with 10 hours and 18 minutes.\n\n", "description": "Younger Koreans Embrace Shorter Working Hours", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/10/2019101000633_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
