In Melbourne and Sydney, it has increased by 183 per cent and 102 per cent, respectively.\n\nThis is because state governments have made minimal changes to stamp duty thresholds despite rising property prices, says Coates.\n\n\"House prices and stamp duty have run well ahead of wages,\" he says. \"Whereas average earnings have risen by 21 per cent after inflation since 2004, nationwide house prices have risen 38 per cent, and by much more in Sydney and Melbourne. Buyers are spending more on stamp duty, as a proportion of their wages, than 15 years ago.\"\n\nExclusive analysis of total buying costs (excluding stamp duty) by buyer's agent Wakelin Property Advisory, shows they have increased by about 14 per cent since 2012. \u201cThis is not insignificant, but not excessive,\u201d says director Jarrod McCabe.\n\nInflation-linked rise\n\nWakelin finds, based on government statistics, the national house price index rose about 34 per cent, which means a house worth $750,000 in 2012 would sell for about $1 million in 2019.\n\n\u201cMany of the services related to transactions \u2013 such as conveyancing, removalists and building inspections \u2013 have only gone up by inflation,\u201d McCabe says.\n\nConveyancing has risen from about $1000 to $1150, estate agency fees have jumped from $15,000 to $20,000, and removalist and storage fees have risen from about $1000 to about $1140.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPwC recently warned that the high cost of stamp duty was discouraging people from buying property better suited to their needs. \u201cBecause it is triggered by the purchase of a property, people may avoid buying or selling. They may stay too long in a house that is better suited to somebody else,\u201d it said.\n\nDaren McDonald, a property partner at accountancy and consultancy group ShineWing Australia, says rising stamp duties, low rents and weak capital growth means properties are less attractive to investors. This is being compounded by rising council rates, land taxes and vacancy taxes.\n\nDuring the past year, rental prices on houses and units have dropped between 3.6 and 4 per cent, says SQM Research.\n\nGraham Cooke of Finder, which monitors rates and fees, says there are limited ways to significantly lower the cost of stamp duty, which ranges from 3 per cent to 10 per cent.
