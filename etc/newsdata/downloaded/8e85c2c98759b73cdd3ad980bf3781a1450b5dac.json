The drug helps some patients control the amount of stomach acid they produce, and is used to treat a range of issues.\n\nSince 2012, the pharmaceuticals giant has experienced struggling sales due to the losses of patents on older drugs. But over the last couple of years, they have turned a corner by focusing on new drugs like Imfinzi and Tagrisso for lung cancer and Fasenra for severe asthma.\n\nThe firm has also experienced soaring revenues from China, where sales have doubled since 2012. In the third quarter this year, they rose by 40 per cent to $1.28billion compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThe divestment money, and the resources the sales will free up, lets the company focus on its three main areas - including cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIt will release cash to develop new drugs for patients who have no options on the market, the drug-maker said.\n\nOver the last year, AstraZeneca's share price has risen by just over a quarter to 7,468 pence per share, and by almost 17 per cent since the end of July.\n\nShares rose by around 0.5 per cent to 7,421 on Wednesday morning.", "description": "AstraZeneca has signed a 239 million US dollar (\u00a3186 million) deal to sell a revenue-generating anti-psychotic drug as it bids to move away from mature treatments and invest in innovation.", "authors": ["Harry Wise For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
