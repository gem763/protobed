Now Category 2, Dorian was forecast to move north of Grand Bahama Island on Tuesday night after battering the Bahamas for days.\n\n\u201cThe hurricane will then move dangerously close to the Florida east coast late today through Wednesday evening, very near the Georgia and South Carolina coasts Wednesday night and Thursday, and near or over the North Carolina coast late Thursday and Thursday night,\u201d according to a National Hurricane Center forecast.\n\nOver the weekend, Airbnb activated its Open Homes program for the Southeast United States, which allows hosts to offer free housing away from the coast for people who are being told to leave or relief workers who are responding to the disaster. The program is active through Sept. 16. According to the home-sharing company, more than 1,300 hosts in seven states \u2014 Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia \u2014 are listing free lodging on the site.\n\nSo far, according to Airbnb\u2019s global head of disaster response and relief, Kellie Bentz, more than 1,300 guests have been booked. And the company is looking for more hosts who can volunteer.\n\n\u201cWe would love anyone to sign up to host their neighbors,\u201d she said on a media call Tuesday. Airbnb is waiving its own fees for those listings but is not offering hosts an incentive to offer their rooms or homes.\n\n\u201cThey literally just want to do this for free,\u201d Bentz says.\n\nAtlanta Motor Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway are offering storm evacuees use of their campgrounds at no charge, along with access to showers and restrooms. The Atlanta facility also has spaces with water, power and sewer hookups for recreational vehicles for $20 a night.\n\nFor those who need to get to an emergency shelter but don\u2019t have transportation, ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft started offering discount codes to use toward the ride on Sunday. Lyft is offering $15 worth of credit each for two rides between now and Sept. 15 to dozens of shelters in Florida and South Carolina with the code DORIANRELIEF. Uber\u2019s credit is a maximum of $20 each way to a state-approved shelter in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, also with the code DORIANRELIEF.\n\nLyft spokeswoman Kaitlyn Carl said the code has been applied more than 300 times so far. Both companies said drivers would not lose out on any pay.\n\nRead more:\n\nDorian weakens slightly but expands in size, putting Florida, Georgia and Carolinas at risk\n\nHow Disney and other Florida parks are handling the threat of Dorian\n\nWhat travelers should know about hurricane season, before or during a trip", "description": "Airbnb hosts are offering up their places to stay, while the ride-hailing companies are giving discount codes for trips to shelters.", "authors": ["Hannah Sampson", "Reporter Focusing On Travel News", "September At Pm", "Hannah Sampson Is A Staff Writer At The Washington Post For The Way", "Where She Reports On Travel News."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GFU-wKiGYJ6N-naWO38qKZjol_0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4ZXO5K72LBGIHEI43OOTSLJ3EM.jpg"}
