REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nA report on Friday showed jobs growth slowed down in September and wage growth stalled, even as unemployment dropped to a 50-year low.\n\nSurveys released earlier in the week showed factory activity is contracting and growth in the services sector is stagnating.\n\nEach report sent traders scrambling to bet on how the Fed might react: on Friday, they pared bets from only days earlier that the Fed would deliver two more rate cuts this year, and they now expect it to stop at just one.\n\nBut for their part U.S. central bankers, a few of whom opposed the Fed\u2019s two interest-rate cuts so far this year and two of whom wanted even bigger rate cuts, generally stuck to their scripts, some more literally than others.\n\n\u201cWhile not everyone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall it is \u2014 as I like to say \u2014 in a good place,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in brief remarks in Washington. \u201cOur job is to keep it there as long as possible.\u201d\n\nPowell and Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida have repeatedly used \u201cin a good place\u201d to describe the economy, even as the central bank delivered rate cuts in both July and September designed to keep growth on track.\n\nAs Fed policymakers sift through the economic data ahead of their next interest-rate setting meeting on Oct. 29-30, they remain divided as they assess the downside risks of the trade dispute and of geopolitical tensions to the economic outlook.\n\nSeptember\u2019s rate cut drew three dissents out of 10 votes; at least two non-voters have since said they too disagreed with the decision.\n\nPolicymakers are \u201cwrestling with\u201d figuring out if the U.S. economy is headed for a \u201csoft landing\u201d or a \u201csteep decline,\u201d Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said during a moderated discussion at Tulane University in New Orleans.\n\nProlonged U.S. trade tensions with China are causing some businesses to sit \u201con the sidelines\u201d and have the potential to affect consumers, he said. Still, he projects that the economy will grow above-trend in 2019, lifted by a tight labor market with an unemployment rate at 3.5%.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of reasons to be optimistic about this economy,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cBut also we need to recognize that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday there is a \u201cvery good chance\u201d of a trade deal with China emerging from next week\u2019s scheduled talks, though he has made similar pronouncements ahead of past negotiations.\n\nKEEPING AN OPEN MIND\n\nBostic\u2019s counterpart at the Boston Fed, Eric Rosengren, who opposed the central bank\u2019s two rate cuts this year, said he too was parsing the data, and had an \u201copen mind\u201d on policy ahead.\n\nU.S. employment growth is getting to what he \u201cwould expect in kind of a stable economy,\u201d Rosengren told CNBC in an interview. \u201cI think the bigger question is whether it ends up being weaker from here and that depends importantly on what happens on the consumer side of the economy.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department report Friday showed the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% last month as U.S. employers added 136,000 jobs, down from 168,000 jobs created in August but still plenty to keep up with labor market growth.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, interviewed later in the day on CNBC, said that so far she is not seeing signs that weakness in manufacturing is spilling over to consumer spending, which has been strong and accounts for about 70% of the U.S. economy.\n\nStill, she said, trade spats and slowing global growth are a headwind on U.S. exports and that she takes those risks seriously.\n\nAsked whether she would support a rate cut if she had to decide today, Mester took issue with the very question.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to say today,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, I really think it\u2019s important that we really look at the incoming information that we are going to get as we work up to the end-of-the month meeting.\u201d", "description": "Federal Reserve policymakers on Friday signaled they are on high alert for signs that uncertainty over trade policy and slowing global growth are beginning to hold back the broader U.S. economy, but so far they have flagged little in the data that is pointing one way or the other.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437154256&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931J6", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
