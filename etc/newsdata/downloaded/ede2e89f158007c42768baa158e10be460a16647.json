In 2004, they replaced them with two English cottages up on a hill, which have been designated as a main house and a guest house.\n\n\"The workmanship on these is just stunning,\" Ms. Biniasz said. \"They got local artisans to do the work.\"\n\nDesign details include wide-plank pine floors, wrought-iron cabinets and staircases, radiant heat flooring, vaulted and beamed ceilings, stone fireplaces, built-in window seats, and French doors that open to the gardens and grounds.\n\nMore: A 10-Acre Estate on Washington State\u2019s Bainbridge Island Built by the U.S. Navy\n\nThe kitchen in the main house has a wood-burning stove, a farm sink, a walk-in pantry, an island and custom cabinets.\n\nThe mid-century modern beach house, which was built in 1960, has been extensively updated by the owners. It offers three wood-burning fireplaces and a wood stove.\n\n\"All five bedrooms in the beach house have views of the water,\" Ms. Biniasz said.\n\nStats\n\nThe 3,455-square-foot main house has one bedroom, one full bathroom and one partial bathroom.\n\nThere is also a 4,877-square-foot beach house with five bedrooms, one full bathroom and two partial bathrooms, as well as a 1,873-square-foot guesthouse with two bedrooms, one full bathroom and one partial bath.\n\nThe compound is on a very private 126-acre parcel.\n\nFrom Penta: Great Escapes: Hot Springs and Ski Slopes in a Colorado Hideaway\n\nAmenities\n\nThe main house has a wine cellar and an elevator. Other amenities include a dock and a beach, stunning water and forest views, English gardens, and orchards with cherry, pear and apple trees. There is a red barn that was built for stables but now holds the owners\u2019 sports cars; it has a full bathroom and washer and dryer.\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nThe unincorporated community of Eastsound is the largest population center on Orcas Island and the second largest in San Juan County.\n\nThe compound is a seven-minute drive from Eastsound and a 55-minute flight from Seattle, Ms. Biniasz said.\n\n\"The downtown is quaint and charming, with local restaurants and exceptional dining and niche-y craft stores,\" she said.\n\nThe weather is similar to Seattle, she added. \"It never gets too hot and you have nice coastal breezes.\"\n\nAgent: Julie Biniasz, Realogics Sotheby's International Realty\n\nView the original listing.
