He pleaded guilty to the charges in July.\n\nThe court heard that Free, who has two children, was addicted to pornography and had suffered abused himself.\n\nHe apologised to his victim and said he accepted his punishment, saying in a statement on Friday: \"I deeply regret the harm that I have done.\"\n\nThe victim's mother said her daughter had been educated about \"stranger danger\" but was tricked into following Free.\n\n\"[No] sentence will ever be long enough to make up for the ongoing effects this will have on her,\" she said.", "description": "The man molested a seven-year-old girl after luring her away from the toy aisle of a Kmart store.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/166FA/production/_109189819_gettyimages-841222318.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
