May the great Flying Spaghetti Monster rouse himself from his stupor and let his noodly appendages ground each assembly member in their seats,\" Fletcher reportedly said.\n\nThe Pastafarian invocation is the latest episode in a bizarre saga that stems from a state supreme court ruling allowing fringe religions to participate.\n\nIn 2016, the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly limited the invocations to \u201cofficial organizations\u201d with an \u201cestablished presence on the Kenai Peninsula.\u201d But in October, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that policy unconstitutional.

Its founder sent a letter about FSM to argue against teaching creationism in biology classes, the Homer News reported.\n\nChurch followers believe an invisible and undetectable monster made of spaghetti and meatballs created the universe after drinking heavily, and that his \"noodly appendages\" hold great power. Many label the movement as satire, but it is recognized as an official religion in some countries, the News reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP,\n\nFletcher, who started his chapter in Homer, on the lower Kenai Peninsula, concluded his opening prayer by asking the Flying Spaghetti Monster to provide each assembly member \"satisfaction in the perception of accomplishment and allow them true relaxation and an ample supply of their favorite beverage at the end of this evening's work.\"\n\nHe then ended the prayer with: \"Ramen.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A \u201cPastafarian\u201d pastor on Tuesday gave an opening prayer on behalf of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster before a local government meeting in Alaska while wearing a colander on his head.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
