Timing was a little off and threw some balls, got behind in counts, put myself in a tough spot. Big league hitters take advantage of those mistakes, and that\u2019s exactly what he did.\n\n\u201cI was ready to go. Just didn\u2019t execute tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Orioles were one out from a second straight victory against the Tigers, the only team with a worse record than them, when leadoff hitter Victor Reyes hit a game-tying solo shot off Baltimore closer Mychal Givens in the ninth. After Baltimore again gained a lead in the 12th on Rio Ruiz\u2019s go-ahead single, it evaporated when Eades replaced Paul Fry and threw six straight balls, the first four creating a \u00adgame-tying walk, before serving up the walk-off grand slam on a 2-2 pitch to Hicks.\n\n\u201cTough spot to put him in,\u201d Orioles Manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cI feel bad for it. That\u2019s just a tough spot. All right-handers coming up, I needed a right-hander there and just wasn\u2019t his night.\u201d\n\nFry ended the 11th with a three-pitch strikeout and returned for the 12th after the Orioles took the lead. Another strikeout came between a walk and double, and Hyde pulled Fry after an intentional walk loaded the bases.\n\n\u201cJust being in the dugout when we scored that run and seeing how excited we are, it just hurts to go out there and have it end the way it did,\u201d Fry said.\n\nThe defeat lowered Baltimore\u2019s lead on the Tigers to 3\u00bd games with 14 to play while delivering their 100th loss of 2019. After suffering through triple-digit defeats only twice from 1954 to 2017, the Orioles (48-100) now have back-to-back 100-loss campaigns.\n\nGivens was pitching for the third time in four games when he allowed his career-high 11th home run. He only had a lead to protect in the ninth because Trey Mancini\u2019s 32nd home run was a go-ahead, three-run shot in the eighth, spoiling a Tigers (44-103) shutout bid.", "description": "Reliever Ryan Eades walks in the tying run in the 12th inning moments before surrendering a walk-off grand slam to John Hicks in Baltimore\u2019s 8-4 loss.", "authors": ["Nathan Ruiz"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2DFFACGXOYI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
