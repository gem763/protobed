We are all Lebanese, and we all know they\u2019ve been stealing from us for years and years.\"\n\nFor almost a week, much of central Beirut has been at a standstill over a since-reversed government plan to implement a $6 monthly tax on WhatsApp users, among other questions being asked of the government.\n\nWithin the body of the protests, Lebanon\u2019s youth said it was a ploy to siphon money from students and the unemployed. But they also emphasise that the tax acted as the tipping point following years of government corruption and economic hardship.\n\nIn the first two days, security services clashed with demonstrators in small sporadic bouts of violence, with major roads being blocked around the city and the airport.\n\nBut by the third afternoon, as more than a million people marched towards Beirut\u2019s Martyrs\u2019 Square, the mood mellowed and broke into a revolution of festivities, as Christians, Muslims and Druze found solidarity under the national flag.\n\nStreet corners became host to entrepreneurial vendors selling shisha, flags and Halloween masks, creating a \"tax-free rebel economy\".\n\nDerelict buildings closed off since being destroyed in the civil war, opened en-masse to urban explorers who sought a spot away from the packed streets.\n\nAnd the pristine walls in Beirut\u2019s wealthy Downtown district became canvasses for graffiti artists now unshackled to issue the movement\u2019s demands for revolt, resignations, and a secular state.", "description": "Much of central Beirut was at a standstill for almost a week after what started as protests over WhatsApp tax.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/cd9095a613b44dfcb2a3f73343652970_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
