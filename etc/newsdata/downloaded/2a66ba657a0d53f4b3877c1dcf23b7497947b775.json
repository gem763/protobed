Dame Agatha Christie, who barely paused between books to sharpen pencils during her near-50-year marathon mystery career, is another such marvel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhich brings us to \u201cThe Guardians,\u201d Grisham\u2019s latest terrific novel. Grisham\u2019s main character here is a so-called \u201cinnocence lawyer,\u201d a workaholic attorney-and-Episcopal-priest named Cullen Post. Post has trimmed his life down to the barest of essentials, living in spartan quarters above the nonprofit Guardian Ministries, his workplace in Savannah, Ga. The book focuses on Post\u2019s investigation into the wrongful conviction of a black man named Quincy Miller who was set up to take the fall for the murder of a white lawyer in a small Florida town some 22 years before the opening of this story. (In his life away from his writing desk, Grisham serves on the board of directors of The Innocence Project.)\n\nPost\u2019s efforts to ferret out exculpatory evidence in this cold case put him in grave danger because, for one thing, the shadowy drug cartel responsible for the murder has been known to hold grisly parties in isolated jungle locales south of the border. In the dead center of this novel, Post hears a cautionary tale from a traumatized survivor of one of these gatherings. This account calls upon Grisham to summon up his heretofore unrealized inner Caligula.\n\nIn an affecting backstory, Post recalls his early career as a public defender; but the grotesque contradictions of that job \u2014 particularly Post\u2019s final assignment to defend a depraved teenage rapist and murderer \u2014 brought on a nervous breakdown. After a sincere \u201ccome-to-Jesus\u201d moment during his recovery, Post was ordained and began serving with a prison ministry, which led him to innocence work and eventually Guardian Ministries. A trim four-person operation, Guardian Ministries consists of Post; an underpaid litigator who\u2019s a single mother of boys; an exoneree named Frankie who\u2019s turned private investigator; and the nonprofit\u2019s founder, a former business executive who, similar to Post, had a conversion experience and dedicated her life to writing wrongs of the criminal justice system.\n\nThat said, \u201cThe Guardians\u201d is nuanced in its moral vision: Post acknowledges that most of the prisoners who contact him alleging wrongful convictions are, in fact, guilty; but it\u2019s the thousands of others who have become his vocation. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly easy to convict an innocent man and virtually impossible to exonerate one,\u201d Post reminds a potential client. So far, the team has exonerated eight prisoners.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuincy Miller may just become the ninth. His fate will depend on a relentless re-investigation conducted by Post and his colleagues and some strong-arming of jailhouse snitches and other witnesses who gave false testimony years ago. The lawyer Quincy was convicted of killing turns out to have had ties to a drug cartel. So, too, does the now-retired sheriff who was in charge of the investigation 22 years ago. Post knows he\u2019ll eventually have to visit the secluded scene of the crime, Seabrook, Fla., but he wisely hesitates. Thinking out loud with a colleague, Post says: \u201cOur clients are in prison because someone else pulled the trigger. They\u2019re still out here, laughing because the cops nailed the wrong guy. The last thing they want is an innocence lawyer digging through the cold case.\u201d\n\nIn his titanic efforts to turn justice denied for Miller into justice delayed, Post courts danger both human and supernatural. The climax of \u201cThe Guardian\u201d slyly nods to many a classic Nancy Drew ad\u00adven\u00adture: Post and Frankie steel themselves to break into a boarded-up haunted house, climb up into its dank attic and unearth (as Nancy would say) a \u201cclew\u201d that just may decide Miller\u2019s fate \u2014 all before the drug gang gets wind of their location. Post is a driven and likable loner whom, I hope, Grisham will bring back in future novels. After all, as \u201cThe Guardians\u201d makes clear, there\u2019s plenty of work left for an innocence lawyer to do.\n\nMaureen Corrigan, who is the book critic of the NPR program, \u201cFresh Air,\u201d teaches literature at Georgetown University.\n\nTHE GUARDIANS\n\nBy John Grisham\n\nDoubleday. 384 pp. $29.95\n\nAD", "description": "Grisham is approaching Agatha Christie in his creative output.", "authors": ["Maureen Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kS-LDddHAJTVxfYD9dM5_wqMP8Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNVYOWHQLAI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
