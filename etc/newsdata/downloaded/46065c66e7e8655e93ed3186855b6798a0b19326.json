Cities in that situation include Philadelphia, Providence, R.I., and Fort Worth, Texas, as well as Chicago, according to 2018 data from Merritt Research Services.\n\nThe reasons: Amounts owed to workers and retirees for pensions have lagged behind the assets on hand to pay them. Losses in 2009, plus years of falling short of investment targets, left pension funds with far less than projected. Meanwhile, governments have contributed to that shortfall by skimping on annual pension contributions to balance budgets. Court protections in many states have made it difficult to cut benefits for already hired workers.\n\nRising costs for pensions and other expenses \"have become a new normal since the recession,\" said Mary Murphy, project director at the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nIn an effort to shore up Chicago's finances, former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former congressman and White House chief of staff who served eight years, raised property taxes and helped attract new investment and construction to the city's downtown. But decades of paltry contributions to the city's four pension funds have left Chicago $30 billion short, according to the city's estimates.\n\nChicago has the largest pension liability of any major city, according to Moody's.\n\nThe city's pension cost jumps each year, leaving Ms. Lightfoot to find $1.7 billion for pensions, up from $1.3 billion last year, according to Chicago's 2020 budget forecast. That increase, along with increasing expenses related to bond debt, lawsuits and labor costs, fueled the budget gap, Ms. Lightfoot has said.\n\nMs. Lightfoot must also contend with the teachers' strike, going on since Thursday over pay, class size and other issues. The school district, which is run by a mayor-appointed board, sets its own budget.\n\nThe $11.7 billion city budget Ms. Lightfoot presented Wednesday included an increased fee on ride-sharing trips to the downtown area, higher taxes on restaurant meals and increases to parking meter rates. Budget documents showed the city was able to identify nearly $300 million in savings through \"improved fiscal management\" and other cuts, and plans to save another $200 million on a one-time basis through debt refinancing.\n\nSome of the new bonds will be backed by city sales taxes, which some ratings analysts consider a particularly reliable revenue source.\n\nThe budget now requires approval by the City Council. It is implemented on January 1.\n\nSome of Ms. Lightfoot's proposals rely on help from state lawmakers, who face their own budget issues. The administration is depending on cooperation from the legislature to help land a Chicago casino and to revamp the city's tax on real estate sales, a move Ms. Lightfoot's budget relies on for $50 million in revenues.\n\nWithout that cooperation, Ms. Lightfoot said, the city will need to make \"painful choices,\" an apparent reference to the possibility of raising property taxes, which she has made clear she is not ruling out.\n\nA spokeswoman said Ms. Lightfoot isn't currently considering shoring up the city pension fund with borrowed money, a possibility contemplated by Mr. Emanuel.\n\nS&P Global Inc. analyst Carol Spain said she would like to see Chicago more fully rely on stable, recurring sources of revenue to close future budget gaps, rather than one-time fixes.\n\nWrite to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com and Shayndi Raice at shayndi.raice@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 20:30 ET (00:30 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
