And that doesn't include the cost of travel and lodging at some of the most posh resorts in the United States.\n\nWhy go? Lobbyists tell CNN there is no better access to a member of Congress and his or her top staff than spending a relaxing weekend with them, away from Capitol Hill.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter hosted a cocktail party as the sun set over the Pacific.\n\nIt used to be that lobbyists would take politicians on trips, but when rules were changed and that was outlawed, politicians and their fund-raisers came up with this variation -- organize the trips and invite the lobbyists along to pay for them.\n\nThis past August, CNN followed U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, to a lush weekend retreat at the Montage Laguna Beach resort . The weekend was capped off by a seaside cocktail party hosted by the congressman as the sun set over the Pacific.\n\nIn early September, U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, hosted a golf weekend at the Inn at Perry Cabin , a posh resort on the banks of Chesapeake Bay. A Friday night terrace cocktail party included a special appearance by fellow Maryland lawmaker U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, who was one of the first on the links the next morning.\n\nBoth Cardin and Hunter declined interview requests.\n\nHunter's aide told us: \"The congressman holds events of all types in many different venues and either people choose to support him or they don't, simple as that.\"\n\nCardin's communications director, Sue Walitsky, sent an email explaining that the fund-raiser at the Inn at Perry Cabin was for the senator's leadership PAC, \"so none of the funds raised went to support his personal campaign.\"\n\nSen. Ben Cardin welcomed paying guests to the Inn at Perry Cabin, overlooking Chesapeake Bay.\n\nShe went on to say the weekend also provided the senator \"an opportunity to show off one of the many beautiful locations in his home state.\"\n\nWant to travel in congressional style?
