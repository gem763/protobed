Boris was defeated 322 to 306, a blow to his Brexit deal.\n\nFrom The Independent:\n\nIn dramatic scenes in the House of Commons, an amendment delaying a meaningful vote on the prime minister\u2019s EU withdrawal deal was passed by a margin of 322 votes to 306. The vote means Mr Johnson cannot secure parliamentary approval his deal by the end of 19 October and is required by the terms of the so-called Benn Act to write to Brussels to ask for an extension to the end of January 2020.\n\nAccording to Johnson, he believes the UK should leave the EU by the October 31st deadline, despite Members of Parliament wanting him to extend Brexit negotiations until January 2020. He said he would not negotiate an extension.\n\n\"I continue in the very strong belief that the best thing for the UK and the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on 31 October,\" he said. \"And, to anticipate the questions that are coming from the benches opposite, I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so.\"\n\nThousands of people marched outside Parliament, demanding a say in the Brexit deal.\n\nElation from the crowd in Parliament Square the moment the Letwin amendment passes - huge cheers from the tens of thousands of protestors #PeoplesVoteMarch @LBC pic.twitter.com/8LgoNjU0TH \u2014 Lucy Hough (@lucyhough33) October 19, 2019\n\nIncredible to watch the sea of people on the #PeoplesVoteMarch as we take part in the #BrexitDebate.\n\n\n\nAs Nelson Mandela said, \"the real makers of history are the ordinary men and women of our country\"\n\n\n\nPoliticians have got to give the public the final say.pic.twitter.com/m4fs4PdkDa \u2014 David Lammy (@DavidLammy) October 19, 2019\n\nMUST-WATCH: This is the absolutely incredible footage of today's #PeoplesVoteMarch - still plenty of people on Park Lane, despite the front of the march setting off about 40 minutes ago.\n\n\n\nSign the letter & RT this so everybody knows: \u2014 People's Vote UK (@peoplesvote_uk) October 19, 2019\n\nThis is a developing story.
