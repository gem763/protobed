The author alleges that NBC knew about Lauer\u2019s alleged behavior, including the alleged rape of Brooke Nevils in 2014 at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and sought to cover it up.\n\nFarrow also alleges that his own reporting on the now disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein was quashed in order to protect Lauer.\n\nIn an email to employees on Monday that was published by Deadline.com, the NBC News president, Noah Oppenheim, accused Farrow of taking the company\u2019s denial that it knew of Lauer\u2019s \u201cabhorrent\u201d actions and \u201ctwists it into a lie \u2013 alleging we were a \u2018company with a lot of secrets\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have no secrets and nothing to hide,\u201d Oppenheim said.\n\nRonan Farrow on investigating Harvey Weinstein: \u2018When family issues are thrown at me, it\u2019s a dirty move\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cNot only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny,\u201d Oppenheim continued in the email.\n\nIn his book, Farrow alleges that there were employees who reported on Lauer\u2019s behavior before his firing and were paid settlements, euphemistically known as \u201cenhanced severance\u201d, to silence them.\n\n\u201cOver a period of six to seven years, a period in which NBC had previously denied any settlements, there were seven non-disclosure agreements, multiple ones of those were with Matt Lauer accusers,\u201d Farrow told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on Friday.\n\nAt the time of Lauer\u2019s firing, a spokesperson for the network said: \u201cWe can say unequivocally, that, prior to Monday night, current NBC News management was never made aware of any complaints about Matt Lauer\u2019s conduct.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Oppenheim said NBC\u2019s legal team had now had an opportunity to review the book and its allegations. He said the agreements Farrow cites that are Lauer-related involve employees who by their own admission made no complaint to management and whose departures were unrelated to the news anchor.\n\nThey include Ann Curry, who left after clashing with Lauer, an \u201con-air personality\u201d who departed in 2012, and a \u201csenior member of the Today show team\u201d.\n\nOppenheim concedes: \u201cWe can all agree those misdeeds should have come to light sooner, and that we should have had a culture in which anyone who knew about his abuse would have felt comfortable telling management.\u201d\n\nBut he accused Farrow, a former employee at NBC who ultimately published an investigative #MeToo piece on Harvey Weinstein in the New Yorker, of wrongly saying NBC obstructed his reporting on the disgraced movie mogul.\n\nIn the book, Farrow reconstructs a telephone conversation between Weinstein and Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News, in which Weinstein allegedly griped that \u201cyour boy Ronan\u201d was digging up stuff from \u201cthe \u201990s\u201d and added: \u201cWe all did that.\u201d\n\nLast week, Lauer described the allegation that he hd raped his co-worker as \u201ccategorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense\u201d. He described the encounter with Nevils as an \u201cextramarital affair\u201d and dismissed the claims as \u201cpart of a promotional effort to sell a book\u201d.\n\nIn his book, Farrow does not say how he was able to report the conversation between Lack and Weinstein, though a note in the book states: \u201cBecause this is a story about surveillance, third parties often witnessed or surreptitiously recorded conversations, and I was sometimes able to obtain their testimonials and records.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian Farrow said the underlying reason for the alleged cover-up \u201cis just baseline casual misogyny. And misogyny is a very damning word, but actually it looks quite banal a lot of the time: it\u2019s not believing that it\u2019s an issue that matters.\n\n\u201cA lot of others who, informed by a whole lot of cultural and identity factors, just didn\u2019t care, and didn\u2019t think anyone else would ever care,\u201d he added.", "description": "Journalist Ronan Farrow claims in his new book that the company sought to cover up Lauer\u2019s behavior", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/394dddba40e4722d21a58b2c8c5c4b4e9de365ab/0_76_3930_2358/master/3930.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7369bec9e65f6f83a63a494322acc630", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
