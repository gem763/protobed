No government official\u2014not Joe Biden, not Beto O\u2019Rourke, not any of the candidates who now support \u201cbuyback\u201d programs\u2014has ever sold firearms.\n\nWhat Democrats propose can be more accurately described as \u201cthe first American gun confiscation effort since Lexington and Concord,\u201d or some variation on that theme. Although tax dollars will be meted out in an effort to incentivize volunteers, the policy is to confiscate AR-15s, the vast majority of which have been legally purchased by Americans who have undergone background checks and never used a gun for a criminal purpose.\n\nThe \u201cmandatory gun buyback\u201d exemplifies the impracticality and absurdity of do-somethingism (although Biden\u2019s proposal to ban \u201cmagazines that hold bullets\u201d\u2014so most guns\u2014is also a contender!). Democrats want to turn millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals overnight for refusing to adhere to a law that retroactively transforms the exercise of a constitutional right into a crime.\n\nAnd they do it without any evidence that it would curtail rare mass shootings or save lives.\n\nWhile national confiscation would be unprecedented in American history, we already possess hard evidence that bans of assault rifles don\u2019t alter gun violence trends. Gun homicides continued to drop steeply after an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban expired in 2004. It\u2019s also worth noting that in 2017, the last year of available FBI data, there was a near-historic low of 7,032 murders with handguns, and 403 by \u201crifles\u201d of any kind, not only \u201cassault weapons.\u201d\n\nTo put that in perspective, there were 1,591 knife homicides during that same span, 467 people killed with blunt objects, and another 696 with fists and kicking. (Not every police department reports the type of gun used in homicides (3,096 of them), but it\u2019s reasonable to believe that similar trends apply, since those murders took place in big cities where handguns are most prevalent.)\n\nAlthough a number of Democrats now unequivocally support a \u201cbuyback,\u201d no one has explained how the procedure will unfurl. What will the penalty be for ignoring the \u201cbuybacks\u201d? Fines? Prison terms?\n\nWill local police be tasked with opening case files on the 100 million homes of suspected gun owners who are armed with hundreds of millions of firearms, or will it be the FBI? Maybe Democrats will propose \u201cpaying back\u201d family members and neighbors who snitch on gun owners? How else will they figure out who owns these AR-15s? There is no national tracking of sales.\n\nThen again, many Democrats support \u201cuniversal background checks,\u201d which would necessitate a national database. So subsequent confiscations would be far easier, I suppose. (I can remember a time not very long ago when liberals accused a person of being a tin-foil-hatted nutter for merely suggesting that anyone had designs on their guns.)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to me if every candidate supports mandatory buybacks. Imprecision, after all, is the hallmark of gun-control rhetoric. Of course a non-coercive \u201cbuyback\u201d program wouldn\u2019t work either because no patriotic American is going to sell his firearms under market value. If you pay gun owners more than market value, they will surely turn a profit and purchase new weapons.\n\nThe criminal class and deranged would-be mass shooters have absolutely no incentive to participate, anyway. But you knew that.\n\nThen there is the little matter of constitutionality. I\u2019ve noticed an uptick in gun grabbers\u2014a phrase that\u2019s no longer hyperbole\u2014arguing that Americans don\u2019t need AR-15s to hunt, as if it mattered.\n\nAlthough ARs are used by hunters, I\u2019m certain nothing in the Second Amendment mentions hunting, because the right of self-defense\u2014an individual concern, as well as a collective one\u2014has nothing to do with shooting deer, and everything to do with protecting Americans from those who endeavor to strip them of their inalienable rights.\n\nThe District of Columbia v. Heller decision found that the Second Amendment protected weapons \u201cin common use by law-abiding citizens.\u201d The AR-15 clearly meets both criteria. It\u2019s one of the most popular guns in America. Its semi-automatic mechanism is the same mechanism found in a majority of other legal firearms in the nation.\n\nThe arguments for a ban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d\u2014 a purposefully elastic phrase that allows the liberal legislator\u2019s imagination to run wild \u2014 is centered on aesthetics, on the false claim that the AR is a \u201cweapon of war,\u201d and on the firearm tastes of a handful of deranged, sociopathic murderers.\n\nDemocrats and their allies like to mock these sorts of arguments as nothing more than semantics; mostly because they need to conflate and euphemize terms to make their arguments work. It\u2019s how they generate favorable polling. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the popularity of gun-control measures. But like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d and other vaguely positive sounding policies, once voters learn what specifics entail, those numbers tend to settle along the usual partisan lines.\n\nIf you think you\u2019re going to have overwhelming support for \u201cmandatory gun buybacks\u201d when people learn that you\u2019re really talking about \u201cthe confiscation of 20 million guns,\u201d you\u2019re fooling yourself.", "description": "The media should stop using phrases like 'mandatory gun buybacks.'
