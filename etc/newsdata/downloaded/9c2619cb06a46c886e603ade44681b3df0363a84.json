I'm not gonna get on your show or anybody else's show and bitch about not being in the Hall of Fame. I'm the one who screwed up, I'm the one that's gonna live with it. Realistically, guys, me betting on my own team to win \u2014 which I did back in the '80s \u2014 cost me $100 million. I mean that's what it cost me. Because I'd have been managing the Reds for 30 years at three or four million (dollars) a year. And all the off-field stuff I'd have gotten. For people who say I haven't been punished enough, they don't know what the hell they're talking about. But I'm a perfect example: Don't break the rules, you're going to suffer the consequences. I'm done with it, OK. Because I know I have no chance to go into the Hall of Fame until I die. And that's fine. Because I'm the one that made the mistake. I don't know how Denny feels about his situation but baseball's always looked at gambling different than drugs or spouse beating or alcohol. They've always looked at that different than they did gambling. I know what happened in 1919. You know what happened in 1919. This is 2019. It's a lot different out there today than it was. ... I've been a part of almost every Hall of Famer that's gone into the Hall of Fame since '69 \u2014 either played with him or played against him. So just like Denny, I have an idea of what the guys in the Hall of Fame did or didn't do. But I'm not worried about that because I'm gonna say this guy did that and I should be in the Hall of Fame because I did this. Because, you know, I just got tied up with the wrong commissioners. Bart Giamatti \u2014 he was a good guy. He did what he had to do. Then the next guy wouldn't do anything because of Bart Giamatti. Now this new guy, he won't do anything because of the other commissioners. It's like you can't step on the other commissioners that made a decision ... and that's the situation I'm in. You know, I'll admit to you guys I bet on my team. I bet on them every night to win. That's how much confidence \u2014 and I was wrong. That's the confidence I had in my players. You know, it was wrong. But I tried to do everything every night to win the damn game. That's what you do as a manager. You try to win every frickin' game within the rules. And I was wrong and I wish I hadn't did it but I did.\"\n\nThen-Reds Manager Pete Rose sits in the dugout during a game in 1989. (Photo: Otto Greule Jr, Getty Images)\n\nMcLain suggested on the podcast that he and Rose should file a lawsuit because \"if (gambling) is gonna be legal, everything else you and I ever done in our life should be wiped clean.\"\n\nLast year, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred insisted that legalized sports gambling wouldn't change his thinking at all with regard to Rose.\n\nLast month, recently retired radio voice of the Reds Marty Brennaman said the \"Hall of Fame will never be whole until the day comes that Pete Rose is in it,\" adding that Brennaman's \"biggest fear is that one day, (Rose) will be in it, but he will be elected after he is no longer with us.\"", "description": "Pete Rose says, \"I know I have no chance to go into the Hall of Fame until I die.
