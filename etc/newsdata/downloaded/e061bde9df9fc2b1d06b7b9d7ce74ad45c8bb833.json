Rebekah Vardy could have grounds to sue Coleen Rooney over the story leak scandal, a lawyer claims\n\nColeen released a statement on Wednesday, accusing Rebekah of leaking fake stories about her to The Sun.\n\nShe had shared them on her private Instagram, but blocked all her friends from viewing them except Rebekah's account, in order to get conclusive proof of a betrayal.\n\nRebekah has denied she was the one to leak the stories and has since called in legal advice and IT experts to see which of the several people who have access to her account could have spoken to the press.\n\nWar of the WAGs: Coleen accused fellow WAG Rebekah on Wednesday after she set up a elaborate ploy to find out who was selling stories from her private Instagram account\n\nSpeaking on Thursday's Victoria Derbyshire Show, lawyer Phil Sherrell from the firm Bird and Bird, who has not worked with Rooney or Vardy, explained what Rebekah's next move could be.\n\nReferring to Coleen's original social media post, Sherrell said: \u2018The question here is what does the person reading that tweet and Instagram post think she is saying?\n\n\u2018Is she saying it is Rebekah? Or is she saying it is Rebekah\u2019s account? When I read that, although the end bit talks about it being the account, there\u2019s a couple of uses of the word \u201cperson\u201d beforehand, I think there\u2019s a good argument that is saying it is Rebekah, or at least very likely it is Rebekah.\n\nLegal action: As sources close to Rebakah reveal she is working with IT experts, a lawyer explained she could take Coleen to court if she can prove she wasn't the one behind the leak\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her, concluding that it was Rebekah's account\n\n\u2018At that point, Rebekah has a claim. But where does that take her? That takes her to court where we will establish if it\u2019s true or not.\u2019\n\nHe went on: \u2018Everything on the internet is traceable to an individual, so we will be able to find out one way or another whether this was someone using Rebekah\u2019s account without permission, or if it was her with the data behind it.\u2019\n\nVictoria asked: \u2018So you can pinpoint exactly how you can find out who has had access to your account?\u2019\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation\n\nThe FAKE stories Coleen shared which were sold to The Sun and followed by media outlets Wayne and Coleen Rooney's \u00a320m 'Morrisons' manor is 'flooded On Tuesday, it was claimed that the Rooney's basement had flooded due to Storm Lorenzo. It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\nTo which Phil replied: \u2018Yes, Rebekah will be able to go to Instagram and ask \u201cwhich time and date my Instagram was accessed,\u201d they will say for example, \u201c10am on this Monday and someone accessed your account using this broadband account, say BT.\u201d\u2018\n\nHe added: \u2018So then we will go to BT and ask for the address that had that account, so we will get an address and get down to a person in a house.\n\n\u2018And it\u2019s true, with everything on the internet, if you look hard enough you can find out who it is.\u2019\n\nAn insider exclusively told MailOnline on Wednesday night that 'Rebekah wants to prove she had nothing to do with the leaked stories and is working with a lawyer and IT experts who can look at the forensics of her Instagram, which several people have access to.'\n\nThey added: 'Rebekah has been incredibly stressed and hasn\u2019t stopped sobbing all day, which is very out of character for her.\n\n'The whole situation has left her distraught and she still doesn\u2019t understand why Coleen didn\u2019t reach out to her first to ask her outright about the issue.\n\n'She\u2019s flying home early from Dubai as she feels her time abroad has been spoilt and all she wants is to be surrounded by family.\n\nA spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'", "description": "As sources close to Rebakah reveal she is\u00a0working with IT experts, a\u00a0lawyer  explained she could take Coleen to court if she can prove she wasn't the one behind the leak.", "authors": ["Joanna Crawley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19539142-0-image-a-87_1570711623675.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
