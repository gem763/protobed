The Brummie boy also apparently nets \u00a3500,000 a year from club appearances on the PA circuit, which isn\u2019t bad going at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn true influencer style, they also managed to seriously monetise their nuptials, with a \u00a325,000 magazine deal for exclusive rights to the big day, as well as a series of reality shows on TLC.\n\nTheir combined earnings mean the couple are earning more than other established Love Island stars \u2013 including former winners Dani Dyer and Kem Cetinay.\n\nThe two may very well have competition soon, though, as this year\u2019s Love Island stars are only just starting to make serious coin. Winner Amber Gill was named Love Island\u2019s most bankable star after bagging a \u00a31 million deal with clothing brand Miss Pap.\n\nUnfortunately, however, there isn\u2019t such a happy ending for another Love Island couple \u2013 Jourdan Riane has apparently dumped Danny Williams after catching him flirting with other girls.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
