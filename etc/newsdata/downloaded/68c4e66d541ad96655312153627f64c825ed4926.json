A law requires that it be sent to lawmakers after an inspector general's determination that it was urgent and credible.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint reportedly concerns a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\nReports about the call prompted Democrats on Tuesday to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, accusing him of seeking foreign help to smear Biden, the former U.S. vice president. There is no evidence the Bidens acted improperly.\n\nSome of Trump's fellow Republicans joined Democrats in calling on the administration to send the whistleblower's complaint to Congress. Members of the House and Senate intelligence committees were allowed to see the complaint on Wednesday.\n\n\"Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say there's no 'there' there when there's obviously lots that's very troubling there,\" Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said after reading the document.\n\nThe Ukraine call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of nearly $400 million in American aid to Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats have accused the Republican president of withholding U.S. foreign aid for personal political gain. Trump denies he used the aid as leverage.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate passed a resolution calling for the report's release by unanimous voice vote on Tuesday. The House passed a similar measure by 421-0, with two Republicans voting \"present,\" on Wednesday even after the administration backed down and agreed to let the Senate and House intelligence committee members view the classified report in secure rooms on Capitol Hill.\n\nU.S. Representative Chris Stewart, a Trump ally and a Republican member of the intelligence committee, said on Wednesday night the complaint had been declassified.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported that the complaint could be made public on Thursday. The White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe dispute over the report is the latest chapter in an ongoing power struggle. The Trump administration has resisted efforts by Democratic lawmakers investigating the president's business dealings and actions to obtain documents, records and testimony from the White House and senior officials.\n\nCOMMITTEE FOLLOW UP\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence panel, said the whistleblower report contained allegations that were \"deeply disturbing\" and \"credible.\"\n\n\"The complaint... certainly provides information for the committee to follow up,\" he said on Wednesday night.\n\nSchiff has said the Justice Department misinterpreted the law in blocking Maguire from disclosing the complaint.\n\nMaguire, who has been in his position for less than two months, may also face questions about a report in the Washington Post on Wednesday that he had threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might press him to withhold information from lawmakers. Maguire, the former director of the National Center for Counterterrorism, denied that report.\n\nAfter the public House hearing at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday, Maguire is due to appear before the Senate intelligence committee in a closed session at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT).\n\nTrump named Maguire, a retired Navy admiral, as the acting intelligence director early last month. Trump has yet to nominate a permanent candidate, who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTrump and Zelenskiy appeared side by side in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday and denied impropriety in their call. The Ukrainian president told reporters, \"Nobody pushed me.\"\n\nAccording to a summary of the call released by the White House, Trump told Zelenskiy that Attorney General William Barr, the top U.S. law enforcement official, and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani would speak to him about reopening a Ukrainian investigation into a Ukrainian gas company for which Biden's son Hunter had served as director.\n\nTrump asked \"if you can look into it.\" Zelenskiy agreed.", "description": "U.S. lawmakers to grill Trump intel chief about whistleblower report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8P09J_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
