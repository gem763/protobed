Heinz has teamed up with the famous Hummingbird Bakery to create a range of cakes inspired by the beans manufacturer\u2019s iconic products.\n\nSweet and savoury sometimes works\u2026 right? (Picture: Hummingbird)\n\nThe cupcake flavours include ketchup, beans, mayo, salad cream and tomato soup \u2013 and we\u2019re not sure how to feel about them.\n\nThe launch of the cakes this Friday is to celebrate the birthday of company founder, Henry John Heinz.\n\nEach of the six Hummingbird Bakery branches in London is giving away 25 of the cakes for free, on a first-come, first-served basis. After that, you\u2019ll be able to buy them for \u00a33.45 each.\n\nOK, we just need to try one (Picture: Hummingbird)\n\nBut do we really need a mayo flavoured cupcake? And how does a tomato soup flavoured cake even work? We\u2019re not sure, but we\u2019re definitely intrigued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeinz notoriously enjoy playing with their classic flavours. Only recently they launched their Saucy Sauce \u2013 a hybrid mayo/ketchup condiment. And plenty of people were excited about the launch of a Heinz Beanz pizza.\n\nSo will the quirky cake flavours satisfy the hardcore condiment fans? We will have to wait and see.\n\nMORE: What is the Halloween witch sex position and how does it work?\n\nMORE: Deaf and blind puppy named Piglet teaches kids about special needs pets\n\nMORE: This national park wants you to vote for its fattest bear\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "To celebrate its founder's birthday, Heinz has launched an interesting rang of cupcakes with flavours including salad cream and mayo.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88946714_1570520485.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
