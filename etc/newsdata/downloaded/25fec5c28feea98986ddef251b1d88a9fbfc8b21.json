Some convincingly, some in closer style, but all with the same outcome. Three points.\n\nIt is 16 successive league wins for Liverpool, a sequence none of their 18 title-winning teams managed, a run that only Manchester City have ever bettered. A sweet 16? \u201cIt\u2019s the media who love statistics,\u201d said a matter-of-fact Virgil van Dijk. \u201cThe reality is we have nothing at the moment.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Klopp can deal more in emotions than facts. He is more a people person than a mathematical mind. \u201cI try to understand how other people think about things but from the way I think about things, I\u2019m not interested in the number, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a number.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Klopp is unconcerned by the grander narrative. Instead he borrows from the clich\u00e9 of taking each game as it comes. \u201cThere\u2019s always a story you can create,\u201d he rationalised. \u201cIn our case, it\u2019s always about how many games we\u2019ve won. You only can create a streak like this if you\u2019re always in the next job.\u201d\n\nThose next jobs are among the toughest. Only five of those 16 triumphs have come against teams who finished in the top 12 of last season\u2019s Premier League. Those next three domestic opponents are Leicester, Manchester United and Tottenham. \u201cInteresting games coming up,\u201d mused Klopp, casting doubt on their chances of relieving City of their record. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound too likely.\u201d\n\nIf one reflex is to say that Liverpool will need to perform better than they did at Bramall Lane to secure three rather higher-profile scalps, another is to say that 16 victories have to come in a variety of ways. Sheffield United were beaten more by a triumph of character than an explosion of quality. There was luck to Wijnaldum\u2019s winner, donated by United goalkeeper Dean Henderson. But there was defiance to Van Dijk, who showed a commanding magnetism to blunt the Blades.\n\n\u201cI definitely enjoy the hostile atmosphere,\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we should all enjoy and we fought hard for the three points. You need to adapt in every game and we had a lot of battles with them.\u201d\n\nFor Klopp, too, it was a test of adaptability. United\u2019s 3-5-2 system brings a unique challenge. \u201cThey played completely differently,\u201d the German said. \u201cWe had to play constantly around the formation.\u201d By the time Leicester arrive at Anfield on Saturday, Liverpool will have gone seven months without dropping a point. Much of that has been about finding a way to win and Klopp unveiled another tactic in an attempt to release Roberto Firmino from the shackles United imposed, introducing Divock Origi and dropping the Brazilian into the No. 10 position. The Blades\u2019 initial gameplan is one others may seek to emulate.\n\n\u201cWe had to have a balance, we have to have a plan, to have stability,\u201d United manager Chris Wilder reflected. \u201cIt is a disciplined formation and everyone has to get their distance right. If I had turned this into a game of basketball, we would have got murdered.\u201d\n\nInstead, he got an audience with a man he admires: Klopp. \u201cIt is great sitting down with him,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe is open and that is quite refreshing because I don\u2019t get that feel that quite a few managers in the Premier League want to do that. He is a right down-to-earth guy.\u201d\n\nKlopp drank beer but Wilder presented him with a bottle of champagne \u2013 albeit admitting that, as someone who is not a connoisseur, he did not know the brand \u2013 to reflect his achievements after a week when the German was named Fifa\u2019s Coach of the Year. A record may follow the prize. To Klopp, though, it is just a number.", "description": "Burnley. Fulham. Tottenham. Southampton. Chelsea. Cardiff. Huddersfield. Newcastle. Wolves. Norwich.
