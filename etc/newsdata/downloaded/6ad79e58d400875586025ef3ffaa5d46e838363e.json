We're the last resort,' he told Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nHis claim comes as the horse racing industry distances itself from an explosive two-year investigation by ABC's 7.30 which revealed an alarming number of retired thoroughbreds are being killed for meat for human consumption.\n\nA 'kill buyer' who purchases retired thoroughbreds and sells them to the slaughterhouse claims horse trainers know exactly where their animals are headed (pictured, distressing footage shows the mistreatment of horses at an abattoir)\n\nAn explosive two year investigation into the $1 billion industry conducted by ABC's 7.30 has blown the lid on the destruction it causes, with horses being mistreated\n\nAn abattoir in Queensland's south-east was infiltrated with hidden cameras showing shocking vision of workers whipping and kicking the horses.\n\n'Come on you dumb f***ing horse! F***! You're dead! You are dead!' a worker can be heard screaming.\n\nThe cameras showed that in just 22 days, more than 300 racehorses, who won $5million in prize money combined, were killed.\n\nMr Loffel has been in the 'kill buyer' industry for more than 30 years and claimed the abattoir had been very stringent on 'animal welfare issues'.\n\n'They won't accept horses if they are too skinny or poor or knocked about. This is something that has got out of hand somehow,' he said.\n\nMr Loffel has trucked horses, cattle and even camels to numerous abattoirs throughout his career.\n\nHe buys the animals at auction or directly from buyers when they have passed their use or are injured beyond repair.\n\nHe says a horse may have tendon issues while others could have breathing difficulties.\n\nMr Loffel claims most trainers will try to rehome the animals, but the demand is not always there.\n\nWhen that happens, he steps in and purchases the animals.\n\nHe says he treats the animals as well as he can when transporting them across the country to be slaughtered.\n\nShocking vision shows workers at the abattoir mistreating the horses, whipping them, kicking them and even yelling at them\n\nMr Loffel will stop for long periods of time to allow the horses to roam around and rest.\n\nTo the outraged critics of the practice, Mr Loffel said they were 'silly sheilas' who were not 'horse people'.\n\nAnimal welfare and behaviour scientist Professor Paul McGreevy told the ABC there was 'no way' the racing industry could defend the behaviour following the release of the footage from the abattoir.\n\n'This is a clear breach of everything the industry has told us. Clearly there's no excuse for that sort of treatment, that's not acceptable... and it's disgusting,' he said.\n\n'The truth that's been revealed by these videos is that thoroughbreds are entering knackeries and abattoirs, and that their treatment within those facilities can be appalling.\n\n'I think we're at a fork in the road moment. There's no denying the footage. This is the sort of material that will shake the industry to its core.'\n\nThe ABC says despite racing's peak body implementing rules requiring the registration and tracking of horses from their birth to their retirement, racehorses are still being killed in slaughterhouses on a weekly basis\n\nThe ABC says despite racing's peak body implementing rules requiring the registration and tracking of horses from their birth to their retirement, racehorses are still being killed in slaughterhouses on a weekly basis.\n\nRacing NSW CEO Peter V'landys tod the ABC he was not aware of any NSW racehorses being sent to slaughterhouses.\n\nHowever, he said if it is occurring the state body would 'put the full force of the law' against offenders.\n\nFollowing the greyhound live-baiting scandal and the momentary banning of the sport, the NSW horse-racing industry announced they would take a proactive stance on the welfare of horses.\n\nAustralia's greyhound racing industry had to go into damage control after it was revealed trainers were tying live piglets, possums and rabbits to train the dogs.\n\nThe live piglets, possums and rabbits were strapped to lures before being sent around the private tracks before being chased and killed by dogs.\n\nFollowing the greyhound live-baiting scandal and the momentary banning of the sport, the NSW horse-racing industry announced they would take a proactive stance on the welfare of horses\n\nAustralia's greyhound racing industry had to go into damage control after it was revealed trainers were tying live piglets, possums and rabbits to train the dogs\n\nFormer NSW Premier Mike Baird banned greyhound racing in July 2016, only to overturn it in October saying it was the 'wrong call'.\n\nFollowing the scandal, the new animal welfare measures in NSW and the ACT aimed at protecting horses before, during and after their racing careers.\n\nMr V'landys at the time said every racehorse in NSW would be re-homed and given to someone who wants it.\n\nIf NSW Racing does find people are breaking the rules, Mr V'landys said they will be dealt with 'pretty swiftly'.", "description": "Peter Loffel, 62, says he buys most of his horses directly from trainers who would know for certain he was going to transport them to the abattoir.", "authors": ["Aidan Wondracz", "Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/19838902-0-image-a-49_1571318986022.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
