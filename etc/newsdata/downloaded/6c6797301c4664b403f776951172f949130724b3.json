In contrast to massive daytime rallies, night protests generally see a few hundred demonstrators stage scattered events, often late at night.\n\nFour months of large and often violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nThe protests started in opposition to an extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent for trial in Communist Party-controlled mainland Chinese courts, but have morphed into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nChina has accused some foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, of fanning anti-China sentiment over Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong's leader Carrie Lam introduced emergency laws last Friday, banning face masks that protesters use to shield their identities, in an effort to quell unrest. But the move sparked some of the worst violence since protests started.\n\nMany Hong Kongers fear the emergency laws could be expanded and further erode their rights.\n\nHong Kong's government said on Thursday that a policy address from Lam scheduled for Oct. 16, when the Legislative Council next sits, would not include any further measures to combat the violence.\n\n\"We have no further intention, particularly in the context of the policy address, of devising new measures to clamp down on protests,\" Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung told a news conference. Lam has not ruled out asking Beijing for help.\n\nCheung said the government's operations were not aimed at stopping protests, but violence. \"We never clamp down on protests, we only clamp down on violence,\" he said.\n\n\"A protest if it's legal, if it's lawful, if it's peaceful...in Hong Kong, assemblies and protests are part of Hong Kong's landscape, part of our core values.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nANGER AT POLICE\n\nMany Hong Kongers fear Beijing is eroding their freedoms and are angry at the city's government for failing to solve social issues such as unaffordable housing and poor job prospects.\n\nUnder a \"one country, two systems\" formula adopted when Britain returned its former colony to China in 1997, Hong Kong has a high-degree of autonomy and its residents enjoy freedoms that do not exist on the mainland.\n\n\"The violence has been accelerating a lot. I think they (police) are really damaging the law and the legal system,\" said protester David, a 27-year-old accountant, wearing a black mask and clutching a sign saying \"Free Hong Kong\".\n\nPolice have fired live rounds and used baton charges and water cannons to quell the unrest. Two teenagers have been shot. Police fired 367 tear gas canisters over the long weekend, when tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets.\n\nApple Inc on Wednesday removed an app protesters have used to track police, prompting some to say they may \"visit\" Apple stores in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok wrote to Apple's chief Tim Cook urging the company to stand up to Chinese pressure and requested the app be restored.\n\nMok said in his letter that the app \"helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality\".\n\n\"We Hong Kongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression,\" Mok said in the letter.", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled government, which has enacted colonial-era emergency powers, said on Thursday it would not take any further measures to counter violent protests and rejected rumours that mainland Chinese security forces were involved in the city.
