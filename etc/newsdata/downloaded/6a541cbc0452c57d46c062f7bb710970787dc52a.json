The Trump campaign insisted on not identifying the officials as a condition of participating in the call.\n\nSouth Carolina, Kansas and Nevada have canceled their GOP primaries ahead of an October 1 deadline to submit delegate selection rules to the Republican National Committee, drawing outrage from some of the president's critics. But one Trump campaign official argued the \"nuanced changes\" the campaign has encouraged \u2014 like changing the minimum threshold eligibility for delegates or adding a winner-take-all trigger \u2014 is \"more impactful\" than canceling primaries.\n\nThe Trump campaign contends the rule changes are meant to make the process more \"efficient\" for state Republican parties, and strengthen the president's position in the general election, not quash dissent.\n\n\"This is about the general election,\" a Trump campaign official said, adding the moves are \"not being done from a position of weakness.\"\n\nBut in order to place the president in the strongest position for the general election, one campaign official said the goal was to make sure the convention in Charlotte \"is a four-day television commercial for 300 million Americans, and not an internal debate among a few thousand activists.\"\n\nThe rule changes, although long in the works, also come as Democrats' impeachment inquiry ramps up, and public support for an investigation increases.\n\nThe Trump campaign and RNC have a leg up on any Democratic contender when it comes to fundraising. The Trump campaign and RNC raised $125 million in the third quarter of 2019, raising $308 million for 2019 to date with $156 million cash on hand.\n\nEleanor Watson contributed to this report.", "description": "One Trump campaign official said the goal was to make sure the convention \"is a four-day television commercial for 300 million Americans\"", "authors": ["Kathryn Watson", "Kathryn Watson Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/bd6e456d-894a-4658-8073-960a1d7202d3/thumbnail/1200x630/3eec77aefbe4a7e4052c746d4b5b1182/ap-19260060425741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
