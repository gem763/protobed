I slowed up and did what I was told. I'm getting absolutely smashed for something I was told to do.\n\n'Whatever it is, I need to clear my name. It's not my style. I don't race like that, I'm a clean racer.'\n\nCoulthard said he was a passionate racer who loved the sport and felt he was being used as a 'scapegoat' for how the race ended.\n\nRace winner McLaughlin tried to play down the controversy around his maiden win while speaking to media on Monday, Nine News reported.\n\nCoulthard (pictured with fiancee Becky Lamb) said he was a passionate racer who loved the sport and felt he was being used as a 'scapegoat' for how the race ended\n\n'I didn't know anything about it until the press conference after the race,' McLaughlin said.\n\n'It certainly wasn't intentional from our point of view, Fabian was just doing something he needed to do, but I just pushed on.'\n\nOfficials hit Coulthard with a drive-through penalty during the race for breach of safety car procedures but have since launched an investigation into the incident and whether it influenced the outcome of the 161-lap race.\n\nA then third-placed Coulthard controversially slowed down and backed up the rest of the field as top two Jamie Whincup and McLaughlin raced to their garage for a pit stop to get much-needed fuel during the safety car period with 26 laps left.\n\nAt the time Coulthard looked to have ensured a two horse race between Whincup and McLaughlin for the title after his go slow approach during the yellow flag ensured a huge gap between a hard-charging Shane van Gisbergen and the leading duo.\n\nCoulthard's snail's pace also ensured he avoided double stacking, or waiting behind his teammate McLaughlin in the pits.\n\nMcLaughlin went on to hold out a fast finishing van Gisbergen by 0.68 seconds to claim his first Bathurst crown.\n\nScott McLaughlin (left) and co-driver Alexandre Premat of the Shell V-Power Racing Team celebrate their win in the 2019 Bathurst 1000\n\nSupercars legend Larry Perkins branded Coulthard's actions as 'disgraceful' on Sunday night.\n\nCoulthard may face further sanctions after stewards re-opened the probe but his team, DJR Team Penske, dismissed the incident on Sunday night.\n\n'Look I am not sure if that made the difference to who won the race,' said American motorsport great Roger Penske, the majority owner of Coulthard's team DJR Team Penske.\n\n'We can look at it and talk about it but it is secondary as far I am concerned when you think about it.\n\n'Everyone had a chance, and the two top duelled it out in the end and the outcome was what we wanted.'\n\nCoulthard's team boss Ryan Story insisted there was a problem with overheating in the car at the time of the controversy.\n\nCoulthard said he took it slow because he was unaware of the location of the incident which had caused the safety car.\n\nVan Gisbergen clearly wasn't happy about the incident.\n\n'We got held up in the safety car by someone, it made it tough (to win),' said the Holden star, who is yet to win a Bathurst 1000.\n\n'(But) that car (Coulthard) has been the sacrificial lamb all year (for DJR Team Penske).'\n\nThe victory marked the first Bathurst win by McLaughlin's (pictured with partner Karly Paone) DJR team since 1994\n\nAfter the race the controversy was the last thing on McLaughlin's mind.\n\n'I can't believe I bloody won the Bathurst 1000,' McLaughlin said after earlier breaking down in tears immediately after crossing the finish line.\n\n'I put so much pressure on myself, our whole team put so much pressure on themselves to make this a good one. I'm so proud of everyone.'\n\nSupercars great Larry Perkins took aim at the Shell V Power Racing Team which he claims exercised 'disgraceful' sportsmanship.\n\nLeading Ford drivers Cam Waters and Chaz Mostert - looming in third and fourth respectively - appeared threats but came into contact, ploughing into the gravel together on lap 124 to prompt a safety car and end their title quest.\n\nThe victory marked the first Bathurst win by McLaughlin's DJR team since 1994.\n\nMcLaughlin extended his series lead over nearest rival van Gisbergen to 622 points.\n\nA total of 201,975 people flocked to Mount Panorama over four days.", "description": "The Bathurst 1000 winner and his teammate have hit out at criticisms one of them unfairly and illegally slowed the field to allow the other to secure the win.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/02/19718692-0-image-a-7_1571101504469.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
