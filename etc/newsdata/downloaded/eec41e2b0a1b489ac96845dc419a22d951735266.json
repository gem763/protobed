Manchester Velodrome.\n\nThe machine \u2014 designed by BC in collaboration with the engineering arm of automotive firm Lotus and bicycle component manufacturer Hope Engineering \u2014 features a radical design with forks and frame that flare widely around the front and rear wheels.\n\nFront 3/4 Lotus/Hope Bike.\n\nPresumably, the bike\u2018s manufacturers have proven this design to have aerodynamic advantages over conventional frame designs where the space between frame and wheels are minimized. British Cycling is keeping tight-lipped on what kind of performance benefits can be expected of this machine, though.\n\nBut given Lotus\u2019 and Hope\u2019s track record in the industry, we should expect great things.\n\nLet me indulge in a little trip down memory lane.\n\nBack in the early 1990s, numerous British athletes set records aboard the Lotus 108 (pictured below), a radical and highly aerodynamic carbon monocoque track bike.\n\nCredit: Creative Commons, Wikipedia Lotus 108 track bicycle, circa 1992\n\nThe Lotus 108 was only allowed to be used after the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI, the sport\u2019s governing body) overturned a previous 1987 ban on carbon monocoque designs.\n\nBy 1992, the Lotus 108 was being used to great effect in competition, however, in 1996 the UCI changed its mind once again, issuing its \u201cLugano Charter\u201d which outlawed the 108\n\nWhile the UCI doesn\u2019t change its mind as often as it used to, it\u2019s still got quite the pedant when it comes to governing the sport \u2013 take its rules about sock height as an example.\n\nFor the Lotus/Hope bike to officially find its way to the Olympics it needs to be ridden in competition, and be registered as designated equipment for the 2020 Olympic games. Its first outing on the boards will be this weekend at the track cycling World Cup in Minsk, Belarus.\n\nA spokesperson for British Cycling told TNW that \u201cHope and Lotus have followed the protocol to the letter, and the UCI have been helpful throughout.\u201d\n\nAs such, the frame and forks have been approved by the governing body and given a coveted \u201cUCI approval sticker\u201d \u2014 a badge all equipment must obtain to be used in officially sanctioned competitions.\n\n\u201cThe frame and forks are fully approved as confirming with technical rules,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nWhile it might comply with regulations as they stand today, historically the UCI isn\u2019t against changing its mind \u2014 its regulatory approach is constantly evolving.\n\nIf the Lotus/Hope collaboration helps British riders set remarkable new world and Olympic records next year, I won\u2019t be surprised if this bike is banned at some point.\n\nBut until then, I\u2019m super excited to see Lotus\u2019 name on an Olympic bike once again.", "description": "British Cycling has just unveiled its new track bike, and its radical design makes me think it'll be banned at some point.", "authors": ["Matthew Beedham"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Flotus-hope-bike-cycling-track-olympics.jpg&signature=af536668b3f921aa41cb91a5b5ae309a", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
