I'm still getting the pain today.'\n\nTrading Standards chief executive Leon Livermore said more funding was needed to crackdown on sellers flogging e-cigarettes to children\n\nThere were just 700,00 vapers in 2012 - a year after the electronic devices burst onto the scene as a 'healthier' alternative to cigarettes\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) has said that vaping is 95 per cent less harmful than smoking.\n\nThis is because they contain less harmful chemicals than traditional cigarettes, which burn tobacco and produce tar.\n\nE-cigarettes allow users to inhale nicotine in vapour rather than breathing in smoke.\n\n3.6MILLION BRITONS HOOKED ON E-CIGARETTES A record number of Britons are now hooked on e-cigarettes, data shows. Figures revealed an estimated seven per cent of people in the UK regularly vape - up from 6.2 per cent in 2018. This means 45 people took up the habit every hour in 2019, bringing the number of vapers from 3.2million to 3.6million in 12 months. Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) polled more than 12,000 people to come to the conclusion. The majority of vapers were ex-smokers (54 per cent), a third of whom claimed their main reason for using them was to help them quit cigarettes. One in five said they took up the habit to prevent a relapse back to smoking while 13 per cent said it was a way to save money. Fourteen per cent said they started smoking e-cigarettes because they simply enjoyed it.\n\nBut a spate of deaths to a mystery lung disease linked to vaping in the US has sparked fears over their safety.\n\nMore than 20 people have died and over 450 have been hospitalised with the illness.\n\nParents have also slammed the lack of checks in place to stop children buying vape products online.\n\nYoungsters as young as 13 are able to easily purchase unregulated e-cigarettes from eBay without any proof of age.\n\nOne mother told the BBC she felt 'frustration and anger' towards the retailer who sold her son a vape pen on the online marketplace.\n\nShe added: 'We think probably there were terms and conditions he was signing up to when he opened his eBay account, but probably just a tick box, nothing more than that.'\n\nInternet retailer eBay said all sellers 'are required to have an effective age-verification process to prevent the sale of e-cigarettes to minors'.\n\nIt claimed it would permanently suspend any sellers who did not comply with this.\n\nLeon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, told the BBC it 'can only do so much' with its current level of resources.\n\n'I'd say to the government, \"If you want your policies delivered effectively, you need to provide appropriate funding and resources through to the front line.\"'", "description": "Ninety of the 227 premises in England handed the goods to underage teenagers without asking for ID in the last year.
