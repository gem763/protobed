They are making improvements but they aren't significant enough.\n\n'We live at the moment every three months at a time. If we get a stable scan, we go on holiday or something, and then we get something called \"scanxiety\".'\n\nKatie also opened up about her hair loss caused by radiotherapy, which left her with a permanent bald patch at the front of her head.\n\nThe mother was left with permanent hair loss after undergoing an operation in June 2018. Her scar is pictured after her second operation when doctors said they could only control her symptoms via chemo\n\nKatie admitted that her confidence was 'knocked severely' by the news of her permanent hair loss and said that it was made worse by the fact the therapy would only temporarily extend her life.\n\n\n\nShe said: 'The radiotherapy that caused me to lose the hair - I could have coped with it more, knowing it would come back.\n\n'But then they said that I would have that bald patch for the rest of my life.\n\n'To be told that it hadn't gone away and this was only going to extend my life for a few years, it really knocked my confidence severely.\n\nKatie was delighted when a hair-loss specialist offered to cover up her bald patch using a special glue and a semi-permanent wig for free\n\nHowever, Katie was delighted when a hair-loss specialist offered to cover up her bald patch with a semi-permanent wig for free.\n\nPreviously speaking of having her 'wig' fitted, Katie said: 'I was halfway through my treatment and most of the hair on the front part of my scalp had fallen out.\n\n'I looked sort of like Gregory David Roberts and I was nervous about showing my head to people who didn't know me or had no idea about who I was before my hair fell out.\n\nKatie said that her permanent bald patch 'massively affected her quality of life' and was 'over the moon' when she was given her 'wig'\n\n'I'd lost a lot of confidence by this point and I thought people were just going to laugh at me or worse still, give me the pity stare. It massively affected my quality of life. I was reminded of my cancer every time I looked at my reflection.'\n\nThe mum was then 'over the moon' when she discovered treatment was available for her hair loss, which would help her feel like herself again.\n\n'I was measured up for the hair piece and a sample was made,' she said. 'It's amazing as it doesn't prevent hair growth if it was to start growing underneath in the future.\n\nKate hailed her new hair piece 'amazing' as it doesn't prevent hair growth if it was to start growing underneath in the future\n\n'The hair systems they provide are made from real hair that is woven into a membrane, coloured to your preference, and is stuck down to your head.\n\n'The rest of your real hair, if you have any left, is then cut, styled and blended in with the pretend hair.\n\n'This means not only are these hair systems very realistic, but they are also semi-permanent. So a person wearing one can swim, shower, go to the gym and basically do anything they like without the fear of a wig falling off.'", "description": "Author Katie Smith, 33, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, won Lorraine's Top Tales prize in 2016.
