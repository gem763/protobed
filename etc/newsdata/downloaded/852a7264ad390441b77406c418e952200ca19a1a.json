But I am not a lost cause!'\n\nThe ex-top minister said the Prime Minister needed to 'reassure' sceptics like him that the withdrawal agreement would not lead to the UK crashing out of the EU next year\n\nMr Hammond's fellow Remainer ex-Tory Antoinette Sandbach indicated she would also vote against the deal despite overtures from No 10\n\nHe added that the Government needed to 'reassure us of a serious intention to negotiate \u2014 and compromise \u2014 for a high-ambition future trade relationship'.\n\n'If the government can reassure sceptics like me of its commitment to an ambitious future relationship under this deal, then even if it loses the vote on the amendment and has to seek an extension to the Article 50 period, it can re-present the deal to parliament in the form of the WAIB once the extension has been granted and there is no longer a risk of a crash-out on October 31.\n\n'There are many colleagues who would then support it \u2014 and the extension could be terminated as soon as the WAIB is passed. I will stand by my phone!'\n\nMr Hammond later told the BBC he would also vote for the Letwin amendment, stating: 'This cannot be the final vote today because we do not know the full shape of the package.\n\n'The Letwin amendment gives us an insurance policy that prevents us having to look at this Bill against the constant threat of the Government to pull the plug and crash us out on October 31.\n\n'We have to remove any risk of leaving on October 31 with no deal.'\n\nMs Sandbach also held out the chance that she could change her mind over the deal.\n\nShe told the BBC today that she had been contacted by No 10 ahead of the vote saying 'my mind isn't closed'. But she said she could not be bought off with the promise of having the Tory whip restored.\n\nKicking off a 'Super Saturday' showdown in the House of Commons, Boris Johnson complained that there might not be a 'meaningful' decision for days longer due to the Letwin amendment\n\nThe House of Commons was absolutely jam packed for the dramatic debate on the Prime Minister's deal today\n\nBoris Johnson today vented fury at a Remainer plot that looks set to snatch away his moment of triumph on a crunch Brexit vote.\n\nKicking off a 'Super Saturday' showdown in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister complained that there might not be a 'meaningful' decision for days more.\n\nHe said it was 'urgent' for the country to get past the standoff and 'unite'. 'Now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together and bring the country together tooday,' he insisted.\n\nIt came after a wrecking amendment tabled by former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin is set to prevent the PM's deal being put to a formal vote, forcing him to beg the EU for an extension.\n\nThe threat came as Mr Johnson has been frantically trying to win over the last few wavering MPs with the numbers on a knife edge.\n\nHe has been boosted overnight by the support of leading Tory 'Spartan' Mark Francois and ex-Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, while there is mounting speculation that at least a dozen Labour MPs will support the package dramatically thrashed out with Brussels this week.\n\nThat would offset furious opposition from his former DUP allies and Jeremy Corbyn, and put the premier on the threshold of an historic triumph that could define the country for a generation.\n\nAmid polls showing the public is weary of three years of bitter wrangling after the referendum, Mr Johnson has told politicians that 'today we can get Brexit done'.\n\nHowever, an extraordinary piece of Parliamentary trickery could yet deprive the PM of the 'clean' vote he craves on his deal.\n\nSir Oliver - who served in Cabinet under David Cameron - has tabled an amendment that would effectively deny approval of the deal until after detailed implementation law has been passed.\n\nThat is widely expected to be selected by Speaker John Bercow, and passed with support from Labour and Lib Dem Remainers, many of whom still want a referendum to cancel Brexit altogether.\n\nUnder the rebel Benn Act, the PM will then be forced to beg the EU for an extension by tonight - breaking his 'do or die' vow to get the UK out of the bloc by October 31.\n\nOne government source said: 'If it passes, it's an act of sabotage dressed up as reasonableness. MPs are still trying to put off the moment of decision.'\n\nSir Oliver insisted that he was a supporter of the Prime Minister's plans and that it was only designed to act as an insurance policy to ensure that the UK did not leave the EU without a deal on October 31.\n\nBut a Government source said: 'The amendment is not about conditional approval \u2013 it is explicitly withholding approval. The vast majority of the signatories have no intention of ever voting for a deal, and have never done so. They want an extension and a chance for a second referendum.'", "description": "The ex-top minister said the PM needed to 'reassure' sceptics like him that the withdrawal agreement would not lead to the UK crashing out of the EU next year.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/09/19915232-0-image-a-2_1571473953862.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
