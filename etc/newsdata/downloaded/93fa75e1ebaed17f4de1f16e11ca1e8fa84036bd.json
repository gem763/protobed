The D.C. Council has awarded a major contract to a company called Intralot to bring sports betting to the District. But a Washington Post investigation found that its local partner has no employees, and its top executive is paid by a company run by Intralot. (Wayne Parry/AP)\n\nSeveral D.C. Council members are asking whether the $215 million lottery and sports gaming contract the council approved this summer fulfills local business subcontracting requirements. This week, they got an answer from a high-level District staffer: Everything\u2019s fine.\n\n\u201cYes, the contract is compliant\u201d with D.C. law requiring companies with large public contracts to subcontract some of the work to local businesses, Kristi Whitfield, director of the department responsible for monitoring compliance with the law, wrote in a letter Monday to D.C. Council Member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large).\n\nBut an investigation by The Washington Post last month found that the contractor, Greek gaming company Intralot, is subcontracting work to its own subsidiary, rather than to the small business it lists on District forms to show compliance with the law.\n\nThe Post investigation found that the business Intralot has listed as its main subcontractor, Veterans Services Corp., had no employees, and that its website touted executives who didn\u2019t work there. The small firm\u2019s chief executive is an employee of Intralot\u2019s subsidiary, DC09, and lives in Maryland.\n\nSilverman has also asked Attorney General Karl A. Racine whether the contract can be nullified.\n\nCouncil member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) also reached out to Racine after The Post\u2019s report, asking by email whether Intralot and Veterans Services \u201chave engaged in fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Racine said Tuesday that the office was \u201clooking into the matter.\u201d\n\nSilverman, who voted against the no-bid contract to Intralot, called Whitfield\u2019s response this week \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cI read the response to say they\u2019re in compliance if on paper it shows that at least 35 percent of the money is going to this company, and we really aren\u2019t concerned whether it\u2019s a real company, or there are employees, or whether local businesses and District residents actually benefit,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cOur residents are growing more cynical about how our government operates, and this is a perfect example that their cynicism is valid.\u201d\n\nWhitfield did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nCouncil member Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large), who was initially opposed to the contract but then provided a key vote in favor, said Tuesday he also still wants answers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s going on,\u201d White said of the subcontract to Veterans Services. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out is this a shell company, or is this legitimate?\u201d\n\nIn her response to Silverman, Whitfield said Intralot and Veterans Services Corp. appeared to be in compliance with the law based on paperwork filed periodically with the city.\n\n\u201cAccording to the representations of VSC and Intralot via vendor verification forms and quarterly reports, Intralot is meeting the goals of the CBE [certified business enterprise] law, and all CBEs associated with this contract are currently in good standing,\u201d Whitfield wrote.\n\nThe verification forms, which subcontractors must submit every three months, are intended to confirm they\u2019ve been paid by prime contractors. Subcontractors affirm they have received payment and \u201cprovided 100% of all services and/or products provided for the Entire Subcontract using its own organization and resources.\u201d\n\nIt is common for contractors to skirt subcontracting laws by creating arrangements under which subcontractors must buy goods or services from them. That way, payments pass through the subcontractor and go back to the prime contractor. Some jurisdictions have systems to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen, but the District doesn\u2019t appear to be one of them.\n\nOn a vendor verification form from Veterans Services obtained by The Post, the firm included a footnote saying a portion of the payments from Intralot included credit toward reducing its obligations on a loan. The footnote did not mention that the loan was provided by Intralot.\n\nAsked last month about the footnote, a spokesman for Whitfield told The Post that the department did not understand it. \u201cIts purpose is not clear, and DSLBD is not in a position to speculate as to its meaning,\u201d James Partlow said in an email, referring to the D.C. Department of Small and Local Business Development.\n\nThe verification form also included a footnote saying the value of Veterans Services\u2019s subcontract was 51 percent of the contract \u201cby virtue of\u201d the company\u2019s joint ownership with Intralot of DC09, which is performing the contract work. The footnote does not mention that DC09 is controlled by and is a subsidiary of Intralot.\n\nWhitfield, in her response to Silverman, said her department does not monitor DC09 because it is not a certified local business. She did not say how DC09\u2019s performance of the contract work satisfies the local business participation law.\n\n\u201cWe wholeheartedly share your desire that District businesses benefit from its CBE laws,\u201d Whitfield wrote. She said her department \u201cwill continue to diligently safeguard the CBE law.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer representing Dylan Carragher, the founder of a sports betting technology business, said Tuesday he filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court contesting the Intralot contract because it was awarded without competitive bidding. Citing The Post\u2019s report, the lawsuit said that the no-bid contract was \u201cdetrimental to the intent behind\u201d the city\u2019s local business participation law.\n\nFenit Nirappil contributed to his report.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe little firm that got a big chunk of D.C.\u2019s lottery and sports gambling contract has no employees\n\nTwo D.C.
