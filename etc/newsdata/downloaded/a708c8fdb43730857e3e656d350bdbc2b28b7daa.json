The animosity has grown exponentially since the United States withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last year and began a diplomatic and economic pressure campaign, accusing Iran of working undercover to develop ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads over a long distance.\n\n\u201cThe United States will not allow Iran to use its space launch program as cover to advance its ballistic missile programs,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in announcing the sanctions.\n\n\u201cThese designations should serve as a warning to the international scientific community that collaborating with Iran\u2019s space program could contribute to Tehran\u2019s ability to develop a nuclear weapon delivery system,\u201d he added.\n\nThe sanctions came a few days after a rocket exploded Thursday at the Imam Khomeini Space Center. Iranian officials said the explosion was caused by a technical malfunction. President Trump declared that the United States had nothing to do with the explosion and tweeted an apparent surveillance photo of the damage.\n\n[Trump shares potentially revealing image of Iranian launch site on Twitter]\n\nPompeo said the incident during an attempted launch of a satellite into orbit \u201cunderscores the urgency of the threat.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian government says it is working to launch satellites, including for communications purposes, but its tests have resulted in explosions several times.\n\nThe United States considers satellite launches a violation of a U.N. Security Council Resolution calling on Iran to shun the development of ballistic missiles that could be equipped with nuclear weapons.\n\nA fact sheet put out by the State Department said the technologies used in developing space launch vehicles are \u201cvirtually identical and interchangeable\u201d with those used in ballistic missiles.\n\nThe new sanctions could be used as a foundation for imposing penalties on foreign companies and governments that do any business with the Iran Space Agency.", "description": "State Department said the technology used to launch satellites could be used to develop ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.", "authors": ["Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8hHNCz8LD0s8hSaUSNI_DlOg7PA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/76IKFFWORMI6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg"}
