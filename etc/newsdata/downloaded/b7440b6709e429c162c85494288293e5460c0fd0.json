(Al Drago/Reuters)\n\nThe whistleblower who raised concerns about President Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelensky informed House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff of the call\u2019s contents before he filed a formal complaint, the New York Times reported Wednesday.\n\nThe anonymous whistleblower told a House Intelligence Committee aide that he was concerned about Trump\u2019s behavior on the call, and the aide passed that information to Schiff but did not reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity. The early accusations were reportedly vague, but the whistleblower made clear to the aide that he was determined to make them known.\n\n\u201cLike other whistle-blowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled committees, the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community,\u201d said a spokesman for Schiff.\n\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi last week announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump amid accusations that he withheld military aid from Ukraine in an effort to prompt a Ukrainian investigation of Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden.\n\nTrump responded Tuesday to the news that Schiff had an early heads up about the whistleblower\u2019s accusations, saying it shows the chairman is a \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s a scandal and I\u2019ll go a step further, I think he helped write it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump previously said on Twitter that he wants Schiff \u201cquestioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\u201d adding that the California Democrat \u201cmade up what I actually said by lying to Congress.\u201d", "description": "House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff received early information about the accusations against President Trump made by the whistleblower.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
