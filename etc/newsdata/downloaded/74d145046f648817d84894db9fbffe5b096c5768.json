By the time Ms Poon\u2019s body had been discovered hidden among park bushes, Mr Chan was back in Hong Kong, where he later confessed to the crime.\n\nHe could not be easily extradited to face trial in Taiwan, despite requests from the island\u2019s authorities, because no formal extradition agreement exists.\n\nInstead, Mr Chan, 20, was charged in Hong Kong with the lesser crime of money laundering, which landed him in prison.\n\nAs his case unfolded, the Hong Kong government launched a new proposal in February that would explicitly permit extradition to other jurisdictions, and crucially, allow foreign and Chinese nationals \u2013 even those transiting through the city \u2013 to be sent to mainland China for trial.", "description": "Chan Tong-kai, the murder suspect whose case sparked a political crisis in Hong Kong, has been released after serving 18 months in prison.", "authors": ["Sophia Yan", "Anna Kam", "Nicola Smith", "Daniel Kawczynski", "David Collins", "Charlotte Runcie", "Jan Etherington", "Philip Johnston", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213848954-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQDfO_Li8BnuRdRCVfSGXuTuFIhELwdJ7eo4aJfswkVw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
