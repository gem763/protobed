He needed to earn enough money to pay for his wife Sokun\u2019s impending hospital stay to give birth to their first child. He intended to be away for two months.\n\nHe would not see his wife again for five years. After a middleman on the Thai-Cambodian border promised he could earn a lot of money drying fish, Prum was sold into slave labour, sent to sea on a fishing trawler. He was forced to work around the clock and through storms, allowed a maximum two hours\u2019 sleep by day and two hours at night.\n\nViolence happened on the boat every day for the next four years as a way of keeping those enslaved in line, Prum tells Guardian Australia through a translator. He says people would disappear off the boats without warning, and were assumed to have been killed and thrown into the sea. One night, Prum says he saw one Thai worker cut another man\u2019s head off with a cleaver.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cover of Vannank Anan Prum\u2019s graphic memoir, The Dead Eye and the Deep Blue Sea. Photograph: Seven Stories Press\n\nPrum writes about and explicitly draws these horrific experiences in his new graphic memoir of modern slavery, The Dead Eye and the Deep Blue Sea. The story includes his experience of jumping ship to attempt to swim to his escape, only to be sold by his \u201crescuers\u201d into slavery on a palm oil plantation on the Malaysian coast.\n\nHis return home to his wife and the daughter born in his absence was eventually secured by LICADHO, a Cambodian human rights organisation, in 2011.\n\n\u201cThere are many slaves who die in the ocean, and their children don\u2019t know where they have gone,\u201d says Prum. \u201cIf we don\u2019t share these stories, the world doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\n\nShip of horrors: life and death on the lawless high seas Read more\n\nThe rest of the world is implicated in this slavery. Some of the \u201ctrash fish\u201d caught by enforced labour on these boats gets used as pet food sold in supermarkets, as well as used as a cheap protein feed in prawn farming. An estimated 200,000 migrant workers from Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos are prone to such exploitation by the $6.5 billion Thai fishing industry, according to the Raks Thai Foundation. But the figures are hard to confirm, says Kate Kennedy, a former executive officer of Hagar Australia, part of an international organisation dedicated to restoring the lives of people broken by human trafficking.\n\nThe boys and men are typically \u201ctricked\u201d onto boats, says Kennedy, bonded with a debt that never goes away: \u201cThey\u2019re not being paid, they\u2019re trapped on boats, and it\u2019s particularly violent.\u201d Ship captains use electric shock treatment, sleep deprivation and drugs to keep the labourers passive, she says.\n\nI wanted to understand how you become capable of such brutality and inhumanity Film director Rodd Rathjen\n\nIn 2015, Hagar helped rehabilitate some of hundreds of boys and young men rescued in the Indonesian town of Benjina, which straddles two islands in the Indonesian province of Maluku, about 800 km north of Darwin. The workers had been enslaved on Thai shipping trawlers for years, many incarcerated on the island in iron cages. Most of those workers had seen a \u201cdemonstration murder\u201d, says Kennedy, and post-traumatic stress is a \u201cmassive characteristic\u201d of these victims.\n\nNon-government organisations such as Hagar attempt to give these boys and men vocational training to repurpose their lives. \u201cA number ended up just going back into the fishing industry,\u201d says Kennedy. \u201cIt was the only way they knew how to live, which was all so awful.\u201d\n\nKennedy is an executive producer of a new live-action feature film, Buoyancy, by Melbourne director and writer Rodd Rathjen. It is a story of the Thai fishing slave trade, and the characters\u2019 experiences are based on Rathjen\u2019s interviews with slavery survivors such as those on Benjina. The movie, though fictional and unrelated to Prum\u2019s slavery graphic memoir, is strikingly similar in its subject matter. Buoyancy is naturalistic in style and uses untrained actors, including, in non-speaking roles, some who had been enslaved on trawlers \u201cto varying degrees\u201d, says Rathjen.\n\nIn his acting debut, Cambodian Sarm Heng plays Chakra, who is tricked onto a Thai fishing trawler where he witnesses violence, torture and murder. Heng, a former street kid found by the casting director through Green Gecko, a non-government organisation in San Riep, was 14 at the time of filming, which took place over three weeks off the coast at Sihanoukville. \u201cSome of the things I asked Sarm to experience emotionally and psychologically were quite challenging for him,\u201d says Rathjen. \u201cWe just had to separate the acting from real life and throw our arms around him when we were finished shooting\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Actor Sarm Heng and director Rodd Rathjen on the set of Buoyancy.\n\nRathjen says that, speaking to survivors, he came to understand the \u201cprocess of dehumanisation\u201d that takes place on the boats, and he wants his Buoyancy audience to wonder whether the character of Chakra, also aged 14, will become violent like his captain, Rom Ran (played by Thanawut Kasro). \u201cI wanted to understand how you become capable of such brutality and inhumanity,\u201d he says.\n\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\nKennedy says there has been a gradual trend in anti-slavery legislation towards supply chain reporting, commencing with California\u2019s Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010, and increased penalisation, with the US strengthening its powers to exclude companies from federal contracts if they fail to report on human trafficking in their supply chain.\n\nIn the UK, a recently concluded review of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 made recommendations to strengthen transparency in the supply chain, while in Australia, the Modern Slavery Act that came into effect this year compels companies turning over more than $100m per annum to report on their supply chains, with the first statements due in September next year. Separate New South Wales legislation, not yet in effect, is expected to go further: companies with an annual revenue of more than $50m potentially face a $1m fine for slavery in their supply chain.\n\nAustralia warned 'discriminatory migration policies' may be driving slavery Read more\n\n\u201cThe commonwealth is going for a \u2018let\u2019s expose\u2019 [rather than penalty] first, giving companies a bit of time to get their fitness up about how they review their supply chain, because it\u2019s not without complexity,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cThere will be increasing discontent if companies are not reporting, or they\u2019re not reporting well or taking remedy when they find slavery in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nThe International Labour Office estimates that in 2016 there were 40.3 million people in modern slavery, including 24.9 million in forced labour (as well as 15.4 million in forced marriage). A 2014 ILO report said there were profits of roughly $150bn a year for traffickers, consisting of $99bn from commercial sexual exploitation, $34bn in construction, managing and mining, $9bn in agriculture including forestry and fishing, and $8bn saved annually by private households that employ domestic workers under conditions of forced labour.\n\nVannak Anan Prum meanwhile is planning to make an animated feature based on his memoir, and his next book will be stories of other people\u2019s slavery, including sex trafficking and women sold as brides. \u201cEvery country must stop the slavery and human trafficking,\u201d he says, \u201cand private companies, please stop this exploitation.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Buoyancy is released in Australia on 26 September.
