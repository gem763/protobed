It would be Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Yang told ABC News. \u201cBecause I would school him.\u201d\n\nMr. Yang, a 44-year-old tech entrepreneur seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, then imagined aloud how the hypothetical match-up might unfold.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, oh my gosh,\u201d Mr. Yang said with a laugh. \u201cHe\u2019d just be standing there, like, \u2018uh, uh.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d be like, score left, score right, score jump shot,\u201d Mr. Yang joked. \u201cAnd he\u2019d be like, I don\u2019t know what he would do, he\u2019d probably gas out at some point.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, it would be Donald Trump,\u201d added Mr. Yang. \u201cI like the other candidates a great deal. We all get along quite well, and we\u2019re all unified in beating Donald Trump in 2020.\u201d\n\nMr. Yang was in Houston ahead of participating in the third Democratic presidential candidate debate scheduled to take place Thursday evening at Texas Southern University. He told ABC News that he likes to play basketball before debates to \u201cget loose,\u201d according to the network.\n\nHe previously discussed competing athletically against Mr. Trump, challenging the president last month \u201cto any physical or mental feat under the sun,\u201d The Atlantic reported.\n\n\u201cI mean, gosh, what could that guy beat me at, being a slob?\u201d Mr. Yang said then, according to the outlet. \u201cLike, what could Donald Trump possibly be better than me at? An eating contest? Like something that involved trying to keep something on the ground and having really large body mass? Like, if there was a hot-air balloon that was rising and you needed to try and keep it on the ground, he would be better than me at that? Because he is so fat.\u201d\n\nNine other candidates have qualified to compete in the Democratic debate, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont; Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
