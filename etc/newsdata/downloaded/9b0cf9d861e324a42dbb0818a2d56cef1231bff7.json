The ones with the \u201c\u201d that keep us healthy in a million ways, fromto optimal\n\nYes, you can you beat the system\n\n? As wonderful as they are, they typically lose significant health power in a battle with your stomach. But now, there\u2019s a way to help them deliver their full benefits and give you the best probiotics for your money.Ourisn\u2019t a simple, one-dimensional pathway, where food goes in one end and waste comes out the other. It\u2019s a sophisticated system ofeach with certain jobs only it can do. In the stomach, for example, food and drink, including our wonderful probiotics, get broken down\u2014burned alive is more like it\u2014in a powerful acid and enzyme bath . Probiotics still do a world of good, and some strains survive better than others. But very few survive that roiling acidic environment fully intact. And in order to get any benefit from your probiotics, they MUST arrive in your, alive and intact. ( Probiotic foods like yogurt, kefir and kombucha , you should know, take an especially brutal beating. Don\u2019t count on them for a significant probiotic boost.) So when the remains of our probiotics arrive in the small intestine, their next stop, they\u2019ve lost a great deal of their remarkable power to fight offand other unwanted visitors. We\u2019ve recently learned just how much power they lose\u2014one study shows up to 80% is lost! But we\u2019ve learned how to prevent that loss.\n\nLaughing in stomach acid\u2019s face\n\nThe concept is simple: wrap up probiotics in an acid-resistant vegetable-based coating so they can pass through the stomach safely, then reduce or remove their protection when they reach the less acidic small intestine, where probiotics work their magic and most nutrients are extracted from what we eat and drink.In one resoundingly conclusive study, half of the subjects started out with one billion, and half started out with five billion of the same probiotic strains, but not micro-encapsulated. Conclusion? The groups showed similar increases in probiotic activity\u2026even though the non-micro-encapsulated group ingested five times more probiotic bacteria than the micro-encapsulated group. Put another way, fully 80 percent of the non-micro-encapsulated probiotics\u2019 health benefits were lost. And put another other way, one micro-encapsulated probiotic banged home the health benefits of five non-micro-encapsulated ones. That\u2019s a sensational deal, whose importance can\u2019t be overestimated. While several kinds of food are inherently probiotic\u2014including fermented foods such as\u2014the amount of probiotic content you\u2019re getting from a food can never be certain\u2014every food is different, and every body is different. So probiotic supplements are really the only way to ensure\n\nWhat are the best probiotics?\n\nB. animalis aids digestion and fights off food-borne bacteria, and is also thought to boost the immune system.\n\naids digestion and fights off food-borne bacteria, and is also thought to boost the immune system.

But they come in many, many varieties. The great majority of them are members of two main groups or \u201cfamilies\u201d:andIn each family, there are hundreds of variants, or. You can tell which of the two major families a strain belongs to when you see the letter L. or B. preceding the name, as with lactobaccilus acidophilus. You\u2019ll see that on packaging as L. acidophilus. Here are some of the most common strains that appear in probiotic supplements and in foods and beverages.\n\nDirections: Pile on\n\nReferences\n\nAs far as what\u2019s the \u201cbest\u201d probiotic, there isn\u2019t one. We all have different bodies that react differently to what we put in them, and probiotics have a miraculous ability to sense where they\u2019re needed and go there. So a probiotic strain that helps curb one person\u2019ssymptoms might help beef up someone else\u2019sIn general, all of the probiotics above have been thoroughly studied and found to be profoundly beneficial in more ways than one. So if you\u2019re looking for a probiotic supplement, it\u2019s always best to pile on the strains\u2014the more strains, the better . You\u2019ll see labels that tell you which strains and how manythe product contains. A CFU is a bacterium that can live and reproduce to create billions more of itself. I recommend at least 10 billion CFUs of varied strains in a micro-encapsulated probiotic supplement. While side effects linked to probiotics are essentially non-existent, please consult with your doctor if (I hope when) you plan to begin taking a probiotic supplement. It\u2019s only a minuscule few meds and medical conditions that have been on the scene of an upset, but caution is always good medicine. I wish you happy and healthy supplementing. It\u2019s one of the best ways I can think of to take good care.", "description": "You know those probiotic supplements?
