I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and good-government groups say such moves enrich Trump at taxpayer expense. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office released a statement Wednesday night calling Trump properties \u201ca cesspool of corruption, a black hole for taxpayers\u2019 money, an exploiter of immigrant labor and a national security threat.\u201d\n\nThe vice president stayed at the Trump International Golf Links & Hotel in Doonbeg when he visited Ireland this week.\n\nMarc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, told reporters Tuesday that the decision to stay at the Trump property was made at the president\u2019s \u201csuggestion.\u201d A spokesman for the vice president later said that staying at the Trump hotel was based solely on a decision by the vice president\u2019s office and the requirement of finding accommodations near Pence\u2019s ancestral hometown that could satisfy official meetings on both coasts of Ireland.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s family stayed at the same resort in 2013 prior to the Trump Organization\u2019s acquisition of the property. The statement emphasized that Trump never directed the vice president\u2019s office to stay at the resort.\n\nTrump, for his part, told reporters that he never spoke to Pence about staying at the property.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suggest anything,\u201d he said.\n\nNor, Trump said, did he make a recommendation for Barr to book a ballroom in Trump\u2019s hotel for his annual holiday party.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of hotels all over the place and people use them because they\u2019re the best,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re the best.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s hotel near the White House has been a magnet for lobbyists and foreign interests in recent years.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump said Wednesday he had nothing to do with Vice President Mike Pence staying at his resort in Ireland or with Attorney General William Barr booking a ballroom at his Washington hotel for a holiday party.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kevin Freking"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/ireland_us_pence_05892_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301"}
