It was only the second ship to be found since the battle. The crew hopes to find the rest of the lost ships from the pivotal 1942 battle.\n\nRemains of the other two Imperial Navy carriers from the 1942 battle\u2014the Soryu and Hiryu\u2014have yet to be found.\n\nThe remains of the USS Yorktown\u2014the only US carrier sunk in the battle\u2014were discovered in 1998.\n\nRead more\n\nHow deep-sea predator evolved giant teeth that are invisible to prey\n\nDeepest ever dive reveals heaps of plastic\n\nExplorers find wreck of WW2 aircraft carrier sunk in pivotal battle\n\nThe Second World War love letters that were part of a mystery", "description": "After the recent discovery of a Japanese aircraft carrier that was destroyed in the 1942 Battle of Midway, researchers combing through the deep seas for lost World War II-era warships have found the remains of another craft.Discovered nearly 5,500-metres below the surface in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vsHS0y7H7oIl6Cn_sSnTNg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/7e0d35c6d1885c714e8a6f0c517bca02", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
