I think she looked towards the internet to give her support and help.\u201d\n\nMr Russell claimed the algorithms used by some online platforms \u201cpush similar content towards you\u201d based on what you have been previously looking at.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think Molly entered that dark rabbit hole of depressive suicidal content. Some were as simple as little cartoons - a black and white pencil drawing of a girl that said 'Who would love a suicidal girl?'. Some were much more graphic and shocking.\u201d\n\nThe boss of the Facebook-owned app, Adam Mosseri, said Instagram would this month expand its efforts to block self-harm imagery to include fictional images.\n\n\u201cWe will no longer allow fictional depictions of self-harm or suicide on Instagram, such as drawings or memes or content from films or comics,\u201d he said. He added that images showing \u201cmethods\u201d of suicide would also be removed.", "description": "Instagram has pledged to block drawings and cartoons of self-harm from its photo-sharing app.", "authors": ["Matthew Field", "James Titcomb"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/08/11/TELEMMGLPICT000186390850-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqCzQ2nIadN9uOB-q1CtFlj3zkkCPfwaibS-GZoi7awTI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
