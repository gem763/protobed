The United Nations stands ready to help,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMonday\u2019s attack left wreckage strewn around the area, destroying cars and badly damaging the concrete blast walls protecting the Green Village complex located off a major road in an area of houses, shops and warehouses.\n\nHabib Jan, who was in his house nearby when the blast occurred, said residents wanted the compound, used mainly by foreign staff of international groups including aid organizations, moved to another location.\n\nAfghan residents inspect the site of a blast in Kabul, Afghanistan, September 3, 2019.

A lot of my friends, a lot of my family have been wounded or killed,\u201d he said as smoke spiralled into the sky from burning tyres lit by protesters demanding that the complex be moved.\n\n\u201cOur young people have been killed, our children have been killed, our old men have been killed, our girls have been killed. What can we do?\u201d\n\nInterior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said the blast was caused by a tractor packed with explosives but that armed attackers, who planned to follow up the blast, were killed by security forces. Around 400 foreign nationals were evacuated.\n\nLike other compounds built to house the thousands of foreign contractors and agency staff who work in Kabul, Green Village is a fortified complex of concrete blast walls and steel gates protected by armed guards.\n\nWhile such compounds have been attacked repeatedly over the years, the main victims are often Afghan civilians living in the surrounding area.\n\nThe timing of the attack, as Khalilzad\u2019s interview was still being broadcast, appeared to be deliberate. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid declared the blast had destroyed rooms and offices and caused countless casualties among \u201cinvaders\u201d.\n\n\u201cEnemy claims of civilian losses are false as no civilians were allowed close to the site of the attack,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nKhalilzad, a veteran Afghan-born diplomat who has been leading U.S. negotiations, said almost 5,000 U.S. troops would be pulled out and five bases closed in exchange for Taliban guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States and its allies.\n\nBut the deal did not include a formal ceasefire and Monday\u2019s attacks, as well as major assaults on the northern cities of Kunduz and Pul-e Khumri, underlined doubts about whether it would really bring an end to violence.\n\nOn the other side, officials in the southern province of Helmand, one of the Taliban\u2019s main strongholds, said 15 insurgents, including the commander and deputy commander of a special operations unit, were killed by U.S. air strikes.", "description": "A Taliban attack on a housing complex used by international organisations in the Afghan capital Kabul late on Monday killed at least 16 people and angered local residents who demanded the heavily fortified compound be moved.", "authors": ["Sayed Hassib", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425804414&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF820A6"}
