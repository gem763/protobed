However when overloaded trucks frequently drive on these bridges, one side of the pier may be damaged, which in the long run can cause an overturn.\n\nIn extreme cases, trucks can outweigh one side of the bridge and cause it to overturn.\n\nBridge bodies range in weight from hundreds to thousands of tons, and if one single truck carries 400 tons of goods, some bridges will be at risk of overturning.\n\nZhu's comments were echoed by the research team of Lu Xinzheng, a professor on civil engineering at Tsinghua University.", "description": "The collapse of an overpass in Wuxi, East China's Jiangsu province, which killed three and injured two, is under investigation with an overload of four trucks considered the main cause.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/11/5da0499ea310cf3e97a0b8b0.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
