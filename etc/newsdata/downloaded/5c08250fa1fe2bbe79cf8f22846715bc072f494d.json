Its successor, the larger Type 003, is currently under construction there as well. Images provided to Reuters by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) indicate that the new ship\u2019s hull may be completed within 12 months.\n\nThe assessment is based on the rapid expansion at the southernmost part of the site, which includes new fabrication and assembly facilities, and a new large basin under construction. There are also pre-fabricated ship components stored on the site and ready to be assembled.\n\n\u201cWe can see slow but steady progress on the hull, but I think the really surprising thing these images show is the extensive infrastructure buildup that has gone on simultaneously,\u201d CSIS analyst Matthew Funaiole said, adding that the scale of the build-up exceeds what is necessary for just one ship.\n\nThis looks more like a specialized space for carriers and/or other larger vessels.\n\nChina\u2019s rapid progress in deploying new types of large ships was highlighted earlier in September by the launch of its first modern amphibious assault vessel, the Type 075 helicopter carrier.\n\nAlso on rt.com China launches first domestic amphibious assault ship in major naval breakthrough\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "The Jiangnan shipyard in Shanghai has undergone significant expansion in the past month, boosting China\u2019s ability to produce large military ships, Reuters reports citing satellite images.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da838512030272818689830.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
