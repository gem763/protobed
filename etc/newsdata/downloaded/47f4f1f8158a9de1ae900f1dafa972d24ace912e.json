The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump is expected to address more than 300 African Americans, including elected officials and candidates from national, state and local offices, community and movement leaders and activists, strategists, law enforcement officers, lawyers, judges, business leaders and students.\n\n\u201cHow does he stand up in front of a group of young people at Benedict College and say: \u2018I wanna make America great. Let\u2019s go back to the era of Jim Crow and Reconstruction,\u2019 where lynchings were commonplace?\u201d asked Trav Robertson, chairman of the state Democratic Party. \u201cIs that his vision \u2026 of making America great again?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time we think we\u2019ve heard the most crazy, vile, obscene, insulting thing come out of this orange raccoon-looking creature that\u2019s the president, he surprises us once again,\u201d Robertson added.\n\nDemocrats across the country swiftly condemned Trump\u2019s rhetoric and definition of \u201clynching,\u201d a term that alludes to racist violence against black people, not a constitutional process such as impeachment.\n\nRutherford and Robertson suggested that Trump shouldn\u2019t attend Friday\u2019s forum, but neither has communicated their complaints to the organizers of the event, a reflection of the reality and understanding that Trump is unlikely to be disinvited.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t expressed it to the organizers of the event, because I don\u2019t necessarily believe that if I was putting together a bipartisan event, that I could be upset when the president of the United States decided he wants to come,\u201d Rutherford said.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t that a Republican is coming, he argued, but that Trump is.\n\n\u201cMost people would not be upset if another Republican were coming, and even if that were a Republican president that was not Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I wanna be clear that people are not upset about the fact that it is a bipartisan event, because it is a bipartisan issue. He is the problem.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Trump is coming to the forum, which is named after one of his signature legislative achievements: the First Step Act for criminal justice reform. The Second Step Presidential Justice Forum will offer Trump an opportunity to connect with black voters on a top issue \u2014 at least it did before he tweeted about his own \u201clynching.\u201d His comment could alienate him from a voting bloc and state that could be crucial to securing the White House in 2020.\n\nThe president was largely unpopular with black voters even before his latest controversial tweet. While his administration boasts strong job numbers and the bipartisan passage of criminal justice reform as two big wins for African Americans, Trump\u2019s support from black voters is at 4 percent, according to recent polling .\n\nJones, the Democratic co-chair, said the forum isn\u2019t \u201cdesigned to be a gotcha moment\u201d for the president but rather an opportunity for candidates, including Trump, to make their case. Even so, some Democrats are hoping Trump will embarrass himself on a national stage, talking about a subject he rarely touches on in front of a portion of the electorate that he\u2019s least popular with.\n\n\u201cI think the president needs to have an opportunity to continue to expose his racist values and his bigotry and let students in the area see that this is the wrong leadership we need in South Carolina and America,\u201d said Brandon Brown, a South Carolina native and a former vice president of Jackson State University in Mississippi.\n\nThe upside for Democrats who prefer that Trump be a no-show is that he will likely have to answer for his tweet, in which he claimed he was being impeached \u201cwithout due process or fairness or any legal rights\u201d and urged Republicans to \u201cremember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe owes that much to the people of South Carolina and to the students of Benedict, to say to them publicly why he chose that phrase,\u201d said Shermichael Singleton, a conservative political analyst and HBCU graduate. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any strategic sense to me. It\u2019s not what I would call smart political calculus. It\u2019s blatant stupidity.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Dillard faced scrutiny in 2016 when it hosted a Senate debate on campus that included David Duke, an avowed white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard.\n\n\u201cHe has limited interactions with black folks,\u201d Kimbrough said of Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand black people and he doesn\u2019t understand the South.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s all the more important that Democratic candidates follow through on their commitments to participate, according to Rutherford.\n\n\u201cThis president, I believe, would love nothing more than to be the only one speaking so that he could claim that he\u2019s the greatest, that he\u2019s done more for criminal justice than anybody else in history,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cThese are things that I can absolutely hear him saying. So no, I would hope that they don\u2019t back out of it because we need those counterpoints that can only come from people that are running to replace him.\u201d\n\nConfirmed speakers include former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen.
