It's ridiculous. We're all trying to get psyched up, but shaking hands with your opponent \u2014 that's NFL etiquette. And when you pull bush league stuff, that's disrespectful to the game. And believe me, that's gonna get us fired up.\"\n\nSherman intercepted Mayfield on the second possession of the game. The second-year signal-caller was benched in the fourth quarter in one of his worst statistical performances of his professional career \u2014 throwing two interceptions on 8-for-22 passing for 100 yards and a 13.4 passer rating while also losing a fumble.\n\n49ERS SEND STATEMENT: 'You want idiots to sound like idiots'\n\nNFL POWER RANKINGS: New teams enter top 10 following losses by Cowboys, Chargers\n\nSan Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman speaks at a news conference after an NFL football game against the Cleveland Browns in Santa Clara, Calif., Monday, Oct. 7, 2019.

He hasn't earned anything in this league. How many games has he won? He's acting like he was the MVP last year. If (Patrick) Mahomes did that, it would be one thing. But he would never do that, because he has too much respect for the game.\"\n\nMayfield, known for his flamboyant behavior as a Heisman-winning quarterback at Oklahoma, once was on the other end of a similar exchange when players from the University of Kansas refuse to shake his hand.\n\nAlso, after Mayfield's Sooners defeated Ohio State in 2017, the quarterback planted a flag on the Buckeyes' field. On Monday, former OSU player Nick Bosa got his revenge, forcing Mayfield into an intentional grounding call and then promptly imitating Mayfield's flag-planting.\n\n\"He had it coming,\" Bosa said after the game.", "description": "49ers defensive back Richard Sherman was not happy that Browns quarterback snubbed him of a handshake during the coin toss Monday.", "authors": ["Scott Gleeson", "Published A.M.
