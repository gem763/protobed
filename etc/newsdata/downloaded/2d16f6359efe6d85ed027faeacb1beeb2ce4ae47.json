We only live two blocks apart.\"\n\nCheating can be hurtful and confusing. But it's rarely just about sex.\n\nIt hit in the early hours of the morning, a compulsive itch that crawled relentlessly under the skin.\n\nAny attempts at distraction were futile, a temporary sidetrack that did little to quell the neverending curiosity. Instead,*Ruby realised - it was better to give in straight away.\n\nSo the American woman allowed the other woman's profile to appear on the screen like a hallucination as she was frantically seeking out those messages and photos which sent sharp needles stabbing into her heart.\n\nDespite the pain, the 33-year-old found it easier to know exactly who she was dealing with, as she shared on Reddit.\n\nBut soon Ruby hit the limit of what social media could reveal to her - so she did the unthinkable and asked to meet the woman her boyfriend had been cheating on her with.\n\nAt the time, Ruby had no idea that this meeting would end up changing her life.\n\nWant to join the family?

She moved to America by herself and started her life from zero, went to school, got a degree and is now opening her own business.\n\n\u201cShe was so powerful, the way she talked about her, me, other women. I loved that girl.\"\n\nHer powerful words struck a chord\n\nSo Ruby found herself doing something she had never expected.\n\nShe told Mary that things were over with her boyfriend - giving her blessing to Mary to pursue a relationship with him.\n\nBut Mary\u2019s response changed everything.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018no person who cannot control themselves and has no self-discipline can be in my circle, let alone be my boyfriend\u2019,\" Ruby recalled.\n\n\"One thing that stayed with me after our coffee date was how much she loved herself.\u201d\n\nMary encouraged Ruby to learn to love being single. Source: Pinterest\n\n\u201cShe opened my eyes\"\n\nRuby doesn't mean that in a negative way - it's just that she was completely blown away by how Mary didn't tolerate bullshit from men.\n\nShe learned that Mary has recently ended an eight-year-old relationship, but had no plans to make a move on Ruby's now-ex.\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you how much she inspired me to love my single life, because she was really enjoying it,\" Ruby said.\n\n\u201cShe opened my eyes, she told me to enjoy sleeping alone in the bed and having the peace because one day I\u2019ll find my real man, have kids and dream about those days.\n\n\"She knows what it feels like to be with a real man and will not settle for anything less because she absolutely has no problem being single.\u201d\n\nMary was adamant that Ruby shouldn't forgive her ex. Source: Pinterest\n\n\"Then she looked me dead in the eye...\"\n\nBut the moment that really changed Ruby's life for the better came just as they were about to leave.\n\nMary looked Ruby dead in the eye and told her that she believed giving a cheater a second chance makes you a weak person.\n\n\"Reconciliation is just you feeling sorry for yourself and thinking you don\u2019t deserve or can\u2019t get someone better. There\u2019s nothing strong about the person who chose to be an option,\" Ruby remembered being told.\n\n\"Cheaters are weak, the ones who forgive them are weak too, I don\u2019t want weak people around me, hence your rich, powerful lawyer ex-boyfriend will never get me.\n\n\"This girl is just too powerful to tolerate this kind of stuff, doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t or should stay. Do as you know, it\u2019s your life.\n\n\"Don\u2019t give cheaters second chance, they don\u2019t deserve us.\"\n\n*Names have been changed", "description": "\"She was an absolutely sweet person, gorgeous face and body.\u00a0We only live two blocks apart.\"", "authors": ["Madeline Cox"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3801734c9d163c74f0ae17bf0a19ad7f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
