China\u2019s NBA row suddenly cools", "language": "en", "text": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 China\u2019s state press and internet were notably lacking in fresh attacks on the NBA on Friday, in a possible sign that authorities were working to de-escalate a bitter political row.\n\nThe American basketball league suffered a ferocious backlash after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey voiced support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests on Twitter.\n\nBut after adoring fans cheered on the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in a Shanghai exhibition game on Thursday night, China\u2019s censors and propaganda machine avoided further inflaming the issue.\n\nIn contrast to days leading up to the pre-season game \u2014 when state media editorials ripped into the NBA for interfering in Chinese affairs \u2014 the government-controlled press barely mentioned the issue Friday.\n\nFor the first time in several days, none of the top-trending items on dominant social media platform Weibo were centred around attacks on the league.\n\nChina\u2019s internet is heavily censored and the ruling Communist Party directs social media outlets to block or downplay content it does not like.\n\nBeijing allows citizens to vent online when it serves party interests, with state press often leading the charge, but the party deeply fears social instability and abruptly puts the lid on hot topics that threaten to boil over.\n\nHu Xijin, top editor of the nationalist tabloid Global Times, said both sides now want to cool the feud down, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cI think this issue will gradually de-escalate \u2014 Global Times will not push to keep it hot,\u201d Hu said in response to the paper\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cI also hope the American side won\u2019t make any moves to escalate it.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Fierce reaction \u2013\n\nChina reacts fiercely to any questioning of its sovereignty over semi-autonomous Hong Kong, which has endured months of protests demanding democratic freedoms.\n\nThursday\u2019s game was not aired in China after local broadcasters boycotted it to protest Morey\u2019s comments and the NBA\u2019s support for his freedom of expression.\n\nThe fracas posed a particular dilemma for authorities after outraged social media users began lashing out at Chinese fans as \u201ctraitors\u201d, threatening to split national opinion.\n\nThe NBA, which has a huge fanbase in China, has been caught between the Chinese anger and US politicians, who accused the league of failing to more forcefully push back against Beijing in order to protect its business interests.\n\nThe league has clearly sought to avoid inflaming the issue, cancelling a series of scheduled publicity events in Shanghai without explanation.\n\nNormally outspoken players like Lakers superstar LeBron James have brushed past reporters without comment while in China.\n\nThe Lakers and Nets travel to the southern city of Shenzhen on Friday for their second of two promotional games, set for Saturday.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 China\u2019s state press and internet were notably lacking in fresh attacks on the NBA on Friday, in a possible sign that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/0e113d_nba-suffered-ferocious-backlash-in-china-houston-rockets-manager-daryl-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
