REUTERS/Kevin Coombs\n\nFraudsters posing as Revolut staff had called him, warned him of \u201csuspicious activity\u201d on his account and persuaded him to log in to the app to take various steps to avert it \u2014 thereby enabling them to empty his account.\n\nTheir action had left the 32-year-old from Belfast stranded in Australia and penniless. Turning in his panic to Revolut\u2019s in-app chat-based support, he was confronted with a gauche messaging bot \u2018Rita\u2019, who passes more serious complaints on to humans.\n\n\u201cIt made me think where is the human side of banking, you need to realise you\u2019re dealing with human beings who\u2019ve lost a lot of money and are scared,\u201d Rennick said.\n\nRevolut said that the security lapses stemmed from phone numbers which can be faked or \u2018spoofed\u2019 by fraudsters, rather than due to its app, adding it was rectifying shortcomings in its response to fraud.\n\nDigital banks like Revolut, which has racked up 7 million customers worldwide since it was set up four years ago with the backing of venture capital, are growing at lightning speed, luring new, mostly younger customers with snazzy apps, cheap access to cash abroad and low rates on foreign exchange.\n\nRevolut and peers such as Monzo and Starling are set to treble their total customer base from 13 million to 35 million in the next year, consulting group Accenture predicts.\n\nHowever, if things go wrong, fraud victims at Revolut can find themselves without the support infrastructure offered by traditional banks.\n\nRennick said he was refunded ten weeks after his money was stolen following a stressful battle with the help system.\n\nFour Revolut customers, including Rennick, who lost at least $150,000 (\u00a3122,179) in total, said the chat was slow, written in poor English and unhelpful. All were eventually refunded, simply finding the funds back in their accounts.\n\nThe attacks on Revolut are part of a growing problem facing banks, with some 1.2 billion pounds stolen in 2018 from lenders in Britain alone according to industry body UK Finance.\n\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service said complaints about frauds and scams rose to over 12,000 in the 2018/19 financial year, an all time record and up 43 percent on the previous year.\n\nBritain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has said banks need to focus on fraud prevention, not just reimbursement, to restore customers\u2019 faith.\n\nFor customers like Rennick, a key part of restoring that trust is the way fraud is handled.\n\nHELP\n\nRevolut acknowledges some problems in how it handled fraud cases and in how its in-App chat works, due to a lack of resources and adequate response systems.\n\nThe company on Sept. 2 said it has opened a new customer service centre in Portugal and will hire up to 400 staff there for handling enquiries from customers worldwide.\n\nRevolut has meanwhile diverted staff from other tasks to manage fraud attacks.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly expensive to have people answering the phones for fraud cases because there are clear peaks in demand, but it\u2019s really important for resolving a case quickly and being able to explain to a customer what\u2019s happened,\u201d said Richard Emery, an independent expert who specialises in helping bank fraud victims.\n\n\u201cThe online chats just felt so incompetent, they had no idea what\u2019s going on, it gave me no confidence I\u2019d get my money back,\u201d said Victoria Frost, an airline cabin crew worker and scam victim, who said many of her colleagues use the app.\n\nSoups Ranjan, San Francisco-based head of financial crime risk at Revolut, told Reuters his unit was hiring aggressively to reach an eventual total of around 140 anti-fraud workers.\n\nIn many cases Revolut is adding features now that would have helped the recent victims, he said.\n\nFrost was deceived by a text message that appeared to come from a Revolut phone number, asking her to click on a link to what appeared to be a legitimate company website.\n\nScammers in these SMS-message or \u2018smishing\u2019 attacks use security holes in the text messaging system to \u2018spoof\u2019 or impersonate a company\u2019s phone number.\n\nRevolut said all its customer interactions are done by in-App chat and it never calls users or invites them to log into websites in this way.\n\nRevolut acknowledged that the names such as Mila and Zlatan that customers see when talking to in-App help are pseudonyms, designed to prevent service staff from being identified.\n\n\u201cI have a serious concern with organisations like Revolut where you cannot talk to someone and they have no facility for phoning you,\u201d bank fraud expert Emery said.\n\nRanjan said Revolut has improved the tone and professionalism of its help staff and is looking at adding phone support in the near future.", "description": "\"Have a great day!\" was not the way Gavin Rennick expected 'Zlatan', an agent for his bank, Revolut, to end their instant messaging chat about the 46,000 pounds scammers had stolen from his account in just 24 hours.", "authors": ["Lawrence White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426441898&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831HP"}
