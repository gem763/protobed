We might be seeing history in the making here,\u201d former test batsman Mike Hussey said on ESPNcricinfo.\n\n\u201cWe think no-one can beat Bradman. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to even beat Bradman. But he maybe is pushing the bar higher and higher.\u201d\n\nFormer Australia captain Ricky Ponting described Smith as a \u201cgenius\u201d and seemingly impervious to any bowler\u2019s plans.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cTo think how good Bradman must have been \u2014 to be a third again better than what Steve Smith\u2019s doing at the moment \u2014 is ridiculous,\u201d Ponting told Cricket Australia\u2019s website (cricket.com.au).\n\n\u201c(Smith\u2019s) got four, five, six years of good cricket ahead of him, which if you add it up, that\u2019s probably another 80, 90 test matches.\n\n\u201cThen he\u2019s played 150 games and could have all sorts of numbers and records by then and let\u2019s hope he does, because the way he\u2019s going about it now, the way he\u2019s playing, he deserves to get the rewards from that.\u201d", "description": "The Steve Smith double century at Old Trafford that continued his brilliant Ashes campaign has generated wonder Down Under, with Australia media branding him a modern-day Don Bradman on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426758046&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF85086", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
