The sharp drop in its sovereign bond yields means it can get ahead of its borrowing requirements for this year.\n\nItalian yields have fallen to record lows recently as investors have welcomed an administration that\u2019s somewhat less antagonistic to the euro zone than the previous one dominated by Matteo Salvini and his far-right League party. Yet everything is relative in a world of negative interest rates and Rome\u2019s debt has been a serial under-performer when compared to its European peers. It\u2019s time to catch up.\n\nWith Italian yields now negative on bonds out to three years of maturity, the country is returning to semi-core status among euro area issuers. A successful bond sale would cement that. It could be a political boon that helps Rome\u2019s budget negotiations with Brussels by showing it has the investor stamp of approval.\n\nAlthough Italian yields have fallen swiftly over the past month, there\u2019s still a steep jump of 120 basis points between its two-year and 10-year notes. Its closest peers Spain and France have benefited from a so-called \u201cbull flattening\u201d of their respective curves, where yields on long-end notes have fallen faster than on shorter maturities. Germany\u2019s 10-year bonds yield only 26 basis points more than its two-year bonds. So there\u2019s considerable room for Italian improvement in terms of how much it has to pay investors for longer term debt.\n\nLast year Italy struggled to sell its longer-dated bonds in the midst of its government crisis. But as the political temperature subsides (for now) Italy should take advantage of investors\u2019 eagerness to grab any yield possible in Europe. Close to 80% of the country\u2019s 250 billion euro ($276 billion) fund-raising target has already been achieved so the country\u2019s in pretty good shape. But it could accelerate this and even start pre-funding for next year. When a sovereign issuer only has to pay interest of about 2% for ultra-long funding, and investor demand is strong, it\u2019s prudent to lengthen your average duration of issuance.\n\nWith more than 20 billion euros of bond redemptions and coupons being paid by the Italian Treasury next week, bondholders will have money to reinvest so it\u2019s perfect timing to gauge how strong demand is. That can be judged at Thursday\u2019s regular Italian monthly auctions of medium- to long-term paper, with about 8 billion euros for sale including a 30-year maturity. This should indicate whether issuing a syndicated 20-year bond or even 30 years might be possible. Investor demand this year has skewed increasingly toward longer maturities as returns have turned negative across much of Europe.\n\nIf this summer\u2019s desperate hunt for yield is any guide, Italy could feasibly raise as much as 10 billion euros. It would be a feather in the cap for the new coalition. Given the volatile nature of Italian politics, it\u2019s smarter to sort out your debt-raising when the sun\u2019s shining.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Marcus Ashworth at mashworth4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nMarcus Ashworth is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering European markets.
