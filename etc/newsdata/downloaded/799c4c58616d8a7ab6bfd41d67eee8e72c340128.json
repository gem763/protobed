To which Mr Sidhu replied: 'That was a blatant lie wasn't it?\n\n'What were you doing out of your house, according to your neighbour? What were you doing in the middle of the night when you told this jury that you were so comatose by the tablets that you took?\n\nKevin allegedly caused multiple fractures to eight-week-old Harper Denton before she was found collapsed at the family home on this road in Wixams, near Bedford, on June 12 last year\n\n'Had you done something, Miss Denton, that night that required you to steal away in the middle of the night for what appears to be a couple of hours?'\n\nMiss Denton suggested the story had been the result of 'close gossip' among neighbours and repeatedly denied being awake.\n\nContinuing, Mr Sidhu said that Miss Denton had a very different version of events and that the neighbour had reported the conversation with her.\n\nMiss Denton, 34, pictured outside the Old Bailey earlier this month , met Kevin Eves online\n\n'She says that you made some mention of events early that morning and it was along the lines of that you were messaging some uni friends when Kevin was upstairs with Harper.\n\n'She said it was 4am. It was a group conversation about babies and you were flailing yourself for not being with Harper.\n\n'What are you hiding?' Responding, Miss Denton said: 'I have nothing to hide, absolutely nothing to hide.'\n\nOn Thursday 11 October the court heard how on June 11 last year, Ms Denton fell asleep on the sofa and Eves put Harper into a Moses basket in the main bedroom.\n\nAccording to the defendant, he fed Harper at 1am then woke at 6am to find she had turned 'purple' and was cold to the touch.\n\nHarper was rushed to hospital where she was pronounced dead.\n\nA post-mortem examination of Harper identified 34 rib fractures, 11 classic metaphyseal fractures, two fractured metatarsal bones - one in each foot - and a skull fracture.\n\nThe 'severe' injuries were allegedly inflicted over at least three episodes in the three weeks leading to Harper's death.\n\nWhile the cause of death was unascertained, an expert found the evidence consistent with smothering, the court heard.\n\nEves, 37 denies murder and grievous bodily harm with intent. The court previously also heard that Miss Denton had not been aware of her partner's previous convictions.\n\nIn 2006, Eves, then known as Forbes, was jailed for nine years after he was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and wilfully assaulting a child.\n\nThe victim in that case had suffered 'life-threatening' head injuries and fractures to the elbow.\n\nEves had claimed the young boy was injured after he fell on the floor from a washing machine while in his care.\n\nBut the injuries were said to be consistent with the child being 'swung forcefully by the arms such that his head impacted against a surface such as the floor or a wall'.\n\nOther injuries strongly suggested physical abuse over a 'prolonged period of time', jurors heard.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Cherinea Denton (pictured) said she had been asleep when her daughter Harper Denton was alleged to have been smothered by her father at their family home in Bedford.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/15/19745464-0-image-a-31_1571150099831.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
