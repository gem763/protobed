Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators opposed to Turkey\u2019s military assault in the north of Syria descended on Westminster earlier today.\n\nProtesters holding placards bearing images of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded the Nato member cease its air and ground offensive, which began five days ago.\n\nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged Mr Erdogan to halt the incursion, saying it could undermine the fight against IS jihadists and worsen the humanitarian crisis in the war-ravaged region.\n\nSmoke billows from fires on targets in Ras al-Ayn, Syria, caused by bombardment by Turkish forces (Picture: AP)\n\nA Turkish soldier walks toward Ras al-Ayn, Syria (Picture: AP)\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian fighters sit atop an armoured personnel carrier in the southwestern neighbourhoods of the border Syrian town of Tal Abyad (Picture: Getty/AFP)\n\nMr Erdogan said he would not negotiate and vowed to push on with carving out a 20-mile safe zone along the border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey said 440 Kurdish fighters and four of its soldiers have been killed since the operation began.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said 56 of its fighters have died.\n\nThe Americans have been working for five years with a Kurd-led Syrian group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces to combat the Islamic State group.\n\nTurkey has long objected to the US-Kurd alliance because Turkey considers elements of that force to be terrorists tied to an insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
