Over the years, I've refined my savings strategy. Here's how I make the most out of my high-yield savings accounts.\n\nThe problem with one savings account\n\nWhen I first started saving in my early 20s, I had one savings account. I wanted to have money set aside for emergencies or anything else that I might need money for. I had a pot of cash in savings \u2014 let's say several thousand dollars \u2014 and yet, each month it seemed like there was a reason to dip into my savings.\n\nHaving one lump sum of cash didn't give me any clarity or goals as to what I should use the money for. So I constantly found reasons, some legitimate and some not, why I needed to tap my savings. I finally realized how ineffective this strategy was and branched out to targeted savings accounts.\n\nTargeted savings accounts made all the difference\n\nI realized that my bank gave me the ability to open up to 25 different savings accounts \u2014 and nickname them. I decided to get more specific regarding what my savings were actually for.\n\nSo I opened one account and named it \"Emergency Fund.\" I opened another account and named it \"Travel.\" A few years ago, I created a \"Moving\" savings account when I moved back to Los Angeles from Portland, Oregon.\n\nBeing self-employed, I also have a \"Biz taxes\" savings account, \"Vacation,\" and \"Sick as a Dog\" funds. I have to pay my own taxes so I set aside more than 30% of each check toward business taxes.\n\nAfter my first year of self-employment, I realized how scary it was to get sick. I realized I felt worried on vacation. Why? Because being self-employed, I don't have any benefits. If I don't work, I don't get paid.\n\nWhen you're sick or on vacation, stressing about money is the last thing you should be doing. So I decided to take action and fund my own benefits. Having a buffer of cash in case anything happens has given me peace of mind. I know that if I have to say no to certain assignments or take on less work because I'm not well or on vacation, I can do so and still pay my rent.\n\nBeing hyper-specific about what each savings account was for gave me clarity and focus. No longer could I dip into these accounts and find a reason to use the funds. The goal was clearly stated and I knew what it was for. Having separate accounts and naming them made the process of saving much easier for me. Not only that, but it inspired me because I knew what I was saving for instead of just saving in general.\n\nI set goals for each account, and automated my deposits\n\nThe first thing I did with each of my savings accounts is to figure out how much I wanted in each account. For example, I knew I wanted at least $10,000 in my emergency fund. For travel, I calculated prospective costs and the time I had to save. Once I had an idea of what I wanted to save, I managed those goals with Capital One 360, which used to allow you to set a goal for each account and see a progress bar.\n\nOn top of that, I automated my savings every month so I had no excuses. Every month, I have a set amount that gets transferred from my checking to my emergency fund and travel fund. Depending on my income that month, I'll manually transfer money at the end of the month to my Biz Taxes account, Vacation, and Sick accounts.\n\nAutomating some of my savings and setting up a money date at the end of the money to manually transfer more money keep me accountable to my savings goals.\n\nSaving has given me peace of mind\n\nBeing clear and specific with my savings goals has transformed my financial life for the better. I am more clear, focused, confident, and know exactly how each dollar is used. Not only that, but it has given me peace of mind to know that I have money in the bank and that I'm prepared for a variety of situations. I'm not just saving for emergencies, either \u2014 but the fun stuff, too. Having multiple savings accounts has helped me be financially well-rounded and save for what I need ... but also what I want.", "description": "I've found separating and naming my different accounts gives me peace of mind, and makes sure I have the money for both wants and needs.", "authors": ["Melanie Lockert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d60193e23f19c663461e394-1334-667.jpg"}
