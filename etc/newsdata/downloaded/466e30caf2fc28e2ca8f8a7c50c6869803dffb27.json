Around the same time, his bowel movements became less regular.\n\nThis was accompanied a few weeks later by an extraordinary new symptom: watery \u2018bubbles\u2019 of air at the end of his penis after urinating. His GP referred him to hospital.\n\nThere, he was given a colonoscopy, where a tiny camera is passed into the bowel to look for signs of disease, as well as a camera down his urethra, the tube that takes urine from the bladder out of the body.\n\nThe diagnosis was diverticular disease \u2014 a little-known, but very common, condition, where sacs or pouches form in the intestinal wall.\n\nThe pouches can become infected and so painful that patients have to be admitted to hospital. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.\n\nThe disease is age-related, since the muscles in the bowel lose elasticity with age. An estimated 50 per cent of people over 60 have it, rising to 80 per cent of those over 80.\n\nBut increasing obesity levels and poor diet mean cases are on the rise among younger people, too, as the condition is closely linked to lifestyle.\n\nPoor diet, obesity and inactivity all increase the risk, although it is not known exactly why.\n\nHospital admissions for diverticular disease increased significantly over the past five years, from 113,983 to 138,281, with A&E admissions increasing by 30 per cent.\n\n\u2018The rise is mainly due to lifestyle and people not eating a healthy diet \u2014 in particular, a lack of dietary fibre,\u2019 says Dale Vimalachandran, a gastrointestinal surgeon at The Grosvenor Hospital in Chester and spokesperson for Love Your Gut, a bowel disease awareness campaign.\n\nMost people with diverticular disease will know nothing about it, as few have symptoms.\n\nIn many cases, it is picked up only during investigations for other things, or if the patient develops diverticulitis \u2014 flare- ups where the pouches become inflamed or infected, as happened in Spencer\u2019s case.\n\nFlare-ups affect between 10 and 25 per cent of people with diverticular disease. Triggers can include a diet containing fruit with the skins on, seeds and pips, which can get stuck in the tiny pockets in the bowel and cause inflammation or infection, so should be avoided by people with the condition.\n\nIncreasing obesity levels and poor diet mean cases are on the rise among younger people. Poor diet, obesity and inactivity all increase the risk, although it is not known exactly why (stock image)\n\nIn Spencer\u2019s case, the pouches were filled with debris, including faeces. This had breached the bladder wall, causing a hole to form \u2014 which had then caused the bladder symptoms.\n\nAir from the gut\u2019s gases was passing into his bladder and out of his penis.\n\nThe problem was life-threatening and the only option an emergency operation to remove six inches of infected bowel.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u2019 he says. \u2018It was terrifying.\u2019\n\nWhen Spencer came to after the five-hour surgery, he had a temporary stoma bag to collect faeces while the intestine healed.\n\nAfter two weeks in hospital, he was discharged.\n\n\u2018Even then, I was in agony,\u2019 he recalls. \u2018I had no idea how much you use your abdominal muscles to move, sit, even to stand. Just sitting up in bed was so painful.\u2019\n\nThree months after the surgery, he had to have another procedure to have the stoma reversed.\n\nHospital admissions for diverticular disease increased significantly over the past five years, from 113,983 to 138,281, with A&E admissions increasing by 30 per cent (stock image)\n\n\u2018My lifestyle had caused my problems,\u2019 says Spencer. \u2018I regretted that so much and wondered if I\u2019d ever feel normal again.\u2019 In fact, he was signed off work for 12 weeks. Despite the fact that around half the population will be affected by diverticular disease during their lifetime, a lack of information and awareness about diverticulitis means many put their symptoms \u2014 which include pain, diarrhoea, bleeding and fever \u2014 down to other conditions.\n\n\u2018People know more about IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) or even Crohn\u2019s disease than diverticular disease,\u2019 says Mr Vimalachandran.\n\nFor example, women might incorrectly think they are having period pains and some might even believe they have appendicitis when, in fact, it\u2019s diverticulitis.\n\n\u2018However, appendicitis generally occurs on the right side, whereas diverticulitis might start on the right, but will usually spread to the left,\u2019 explains Mr Vimalachandran.\n\n\u2018There is not enough awareness about diverticular disease, and it is not helped by the fact that people are embarrassed talking about bowel disease.\n\n\u2018We see this in all aspects of bowel disease: people are reluctant to talk about their symptoms or are nervous about investigations.\n\nMr Lynch said his pain \u2018was like a red hot poker \u2014 like nothing I\u2019d ever felt before\u2019\n\n\u2018But awareness is important. You\u2019re more likely to have diverticular disease than not have it.\u2019\n\nWhen it comes to treatment, \u2018sometimes, symptoms settle down after resting the bowel by not eating until the symptoms subside; sometimes, antibiotics are required; and sometimes, hospital admission is needed\u2019, says Mr Vimalachandran.\n\nIf diverticular disease is diagnosed, patients should try to avoid insoluble fibre (which makes food move along the digestive tract more quickly), as is found in foods such as wheat and bran, and opt instead for soluble fibre such as skinless fruit and vegetables, oats and beans, as well as plenty of water. Spencer, who now works in technology and is also the resident magician at Liverpool Football Club, was told his diverticular disease was most likely caused by his erratic and unhealthy meal choices.\n\nHe was told that he needed to completely overhaul his eating habits.\n\n\u2018I was only too glad to change my diet, as it had caused this terrible problem,\u2019 he says.\n\nHe began eating greens and salads, as well as more fibre.\n\n\u2018If I bought pasta, it would be wholegrain. And, when I went back to work, I\u2019d drive an extra few miles to find a wholemeal salad sandwich, rather than go for a burger,\u2019 he adds.\n\nSpencer says it took six months before he felt back to normal again. \u2018Recovery was difficult, but I was so glad that my stoma bag was temporary,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018Eating was also hard at first. Often, I vomited it up again, but, in time, I got used to eating \u2014 though for seven days, I couldn\u2019t eat at all.\u2019\n\nSpencer is telling his story to raise awareness of this common condition that\u2019s so often ignored.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re a nation embarrassed to talk about our poo,\u2019 he says. \u2018More people need to be aware of gut pain and the correct consistency of our stools, and to talk about it.\n\n\u2018Initially, I was told that I had trapped wind. My diverticular disease could very nearly have killed me or ruined my life for ever. Thankfully, it was caught just in time.\u2019\n\nloveyourgut.com\n\nMATURE WELL\n\nHow health gets better with age. This week: Migraines\n\nMedics monitored 374 patients for 12 years and found 30 per cent had stopped suffering migraines by the end of the study\n\nAs we get older, migraines often ease in their ferocity, or disappear altogether. Medics from the Gothenburg Migraine Clinic in Sweden monitored 374 patients for 12 years and found 30 per cent had stopped suffering migraines by the end of the study and most of the rest had fewer, shorter, milder attacks.\n\nIn a 2009 article in Headache: The Journal Of Head And Face Pain, the researchers said: \u2018These data suggest migraine has a favourable prognosis in most patients.\u2019 According to The Migraine Trust, 40 per cent of sufferers will no longer have attacks by 65. Possible reasons include good treatment from an early age, stress levels falling after retirement and, in women at least, hormonal changes.\n\n\u2018Fluctuations in the sex hormone oestrogen exacerbate migraines in women,\u2019 says Dr Nick Silver, a consultant neurologist at the Walton Centre in Liverpool. \u2018When levels of the hormone stabilise after the menopause, up to two-thirds of women will find their migraines ease or disappear. I am not aware of such a clear age-related effect for men.\u2019", "description": "Spencer Lynch, 46, suffers from the little-known, but very common, condition.
