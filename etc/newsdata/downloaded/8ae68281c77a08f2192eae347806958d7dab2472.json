Newborn pandas are pink, hairless, and unable to open their eyes for weeks.\n\n\n\nScientists at the base granted Pelley rare access into their panda nursery to get a close look at these vulnerable cubs. Mindful of spreading germs and disease, Pelley and his cameramen had to dress head-to-toe in hospital scrubs. \"These bears are completely helpless when they're born,\" Pelley said. \"And so they were concerned about any human virus that might affect them, any kind of bacteria that we might bring in.\"\n\nEric Kerchner/CBS News\n\nMany giant panda mothers have twins, but scientists found that, in the wild, the smallest twin would be left to die. Panda mothers' limited diet of bamboo does not provide enough energy to produce milk for both cubs\u2014and that's where human caretakers at the Chengdu Panda Base step in.\n\nIn the nursery, veterinarians mimic the behavior of the giant panda mother, supplementing feeding time with formula in a bottle. When the mother is able to breastfeed, they hand the baby cub back to her, alternating between the two cubs for several hours each day.\n\nThe base seems to have mastered how to rear panda cubs. Veterinarians have delivered five cubs this year, with remarkable success\u2014just about every cub born at the base now survives.\n\nEric Kerchner/CBS News\n\nThe achievement has helped to boost the overall number of pandas on the globe. In 2016, the giant panda's conservation status was upgraded from endangered to just vulnerable.\n\n\"It's really one of the greatest conservation efforts known to man,\" Young said.\n\nTo watch Scott Pelley's report on giant pandas, click here.\n\nThe video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer, Will Croxton, and Matthew Polevoy.
