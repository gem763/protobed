Sometimes your arm\u2019s not feeling great and you\u2019ve got to make up for it and you\u2019ve got to find the adjustment to make it feel better.\u201d\n\nMusgrove struck out seven, gave up four hits and walked none. The right-hander threw 18 of 19 first pitches for strikes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sick. That put him in play for everything else,\u201d Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. \u201cThe curveball and slider played off each other. His fastball command was good with the two-seamer and four-seamer, only one three-ball count.\u201d\n\nPirates closer Felipe V\u00e1zquez worked around a first-and-third, no-outs situation in the ninth for his 28th save in 31 attempts.\n\nJoey Rickard drew a leadoff walk to start the ninth and Donovan Solano followed with a single, but V\u00e1zquez struck out Corban Joseph and Mike Yastrzemski, and then got Buster Posey to ground out.\n\nV\u00e1zquez, who on Monday was involved in a clubhouse brawl in which he punched teammate Kyle Crick, notched his third save in four days.\n\nJos\u00e9 Osuna doubled in a run in the top of the first, and Cole Tucker tripled and scored on Kevin Kramer\u2019s sacrifice fly to give Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead in the fourth.\n\nMusgrove tripled leading off the fifth and scored on Adam Frazier\u2019s single to make it 3-0.\n\nLongoria hit a two-run homer off reliever Yacksel R\u00edos - his 19th - in the Giants sixth.\n\nStallings hit his sixth homer and second of the series leading off the seventh against starter Jeff Samardzija (10-12).\n\nSan Francisco has dropped nine of its last 11 home games and is 31-41 at Oracle Park this season.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some pretty good days on the road but here at home for some reason we just have a hard time getting it going. And then today, he (Musgrove) did throw well, but we just couldn\u2019t get much going.\u201d - Giants manager Bruce Bochy on the team\u2019s struggles at home.\n\nTRIPLES ALLEY\n\nMusgrove\u2019s triple was the first by a Pirates pitcher since May 29, 2010, when Brian Burres did it.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPirates: CF Starling Marte was out of the lineup for a fourth straight game with a left wrist sprain he suffered making sliding catch on Sunday against St. Louis.\n\nGiants: Manager Bruce Bochy moved up RHP Johnny Cueto\u2019s next scheduled start two days to Sunday, the finale of a three-game series against Miami. The two-time All-Star, who pitched five shutout innings in his first game back from Tommy John surgery on Tuesday, had been scheduled to make his next start on Sept. 17 in Boston. . LHP Will Smith (back inflammation) will play catch on Friday. Bochy said his All-Star closer could be back on the mound as soon as this weekend. . OF Alex Dickerson (right oblique injury) took 40 swings on Wednesday and planned to do the same on Thursday. He\u2019ll hit against a machine on Friday and could pinch hit over the weekend, Bochy said. . OF Jaylin Davis left the game for a pinch runner after being struck by a pitch in from R\u00edos in the sixth. X-rays taken after the game were negative. He suffered a contusion, Bochy said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates: LHP Steven Brault (4-4, 4.13 ERA) will face Cubs left-hander Jon Lester on Friday in Chicago. Brault is 0-1 with a 6.31 ERA in 13 career appearances (four starts) against the Cubs.\n\nGiants: RHP Tyler Beede (4-9, 5-33) will pitch Friday\u2019s series open against Miami. Beede ended a streak of nine winless starts in his most recent outing on Sept. 7, when he pitched five innings of four-hit ball in a 1-0 victory over the Dodgers.\n\n__\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joe Musgrove made some adjustments to his delivery, and he's enjoying the results.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gideon Rubin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/pirates_giants_baseball_06865_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f"}
