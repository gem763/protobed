So he sought revenge, authorities say.", "language": "en", "text": "Now, authorities in Sussex County, N.J., are saying that both were the work of the same man, Richard Decker, who lashed out by harassing people who refused to let him have sex with their farm animals.\n\nThe 31-year-old was arrested Oct. 3, according to the New Jersey Herald. Prosecutors said at a Wednesday detention hearing that since August 2018, he had been sending letters and emails detailing his request to farms, stables and horse-boarding facilities throughout Sussex County, located in the northernmost point of the state. Unsurprisingly, many of the recipients were not thrilled to learn that an adult man was interested in having a sexual relationship with their livestock.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecker didn\u2019t take the rejection well, authorities said Wednesday. He left messages harassing the property owners who had turned him down \u2014 in one instance threatening to beat a man\u2019s wife with a wooden stick \u2014 and wrote negative online reviews of their businesses. The 31-year-old also allegedly kept a stash of homemade metal tire-deflation spikes in his bedroom and would plant them in the driveways of farmers who angered him.\n\nIn January, police in Decker\u2019s hometown of Vernon Township, N.J., issued a warning to \u201canyone who has farm-like property\u201d after several residents found that their tires had been destroyed by homemade spikes, which are also known as caltrops. The police department\u2019s Facebook post was deluged with comments from people in the surrounding area, and one man claimed that his family had gotten six flat tires in the past month alone. While some joked about a nefarious scheme to sell tires, others speculated that animal rights activists were behind the vandalism.\n\nAs authorities investigated over the summer, a different kind of conversation began bubbling up in Facebook groups where people typically discussed upcoming equestrian events or buying and selling livestock.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn August, Caitlyn McCurdy, who occasionally leases out horses to fund her work with rescue animals in Jackson Township, N.J., received several disturbing emails in response to ads that she had placed on Craigslist. All three appeared to come from the same sender, who went by the alias \u201cTackyChaps.\"\n\n\u201cI know you are trying to sell your mare but the reason I am contacting you today is because I am attracted to equine and wanted to ask \u2026 would you please give me the permission to meet and possibly have a sexual relationship with one of your horses?\u201d said one of the messages. \u201cIm sorry if my request appears insulting. I am honestly attracted to horses and Im looking for a longer term relationship with one, but I have no place to home one myself. I am a man in north jersey and I would be very grateful if you would consider me for your horses. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe other two emails were nearly identical, though one asked \u201cto stud for your horses,\u201d which indicated to McCurdy that the sender was familiar with equine terminology. The trainer told The Washington Post in a Facebook message early Friday morning that she found the messages \u201csickening\u201d and didn\u2019t respond. Though she didn\u2019t report the messages to the police, figuring that they wouldn\u2019t be able to trace the sender from Craigslist, she posted screen shots on Facebook and warned others in the animal rescue community to be on the lookout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAround the same time, McCurdy told The Post, she discovered that the oil filter had been unscrewed from her car\u2019s motor and that all of the oil had leaked out, which caused her engine to seize. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it has anything to do with him but it is coincidental that it happened shortly after receiving those messages, and not responding back to him,\u201d she said.\n\nAs McCurdy\u2019s warning made the rounds, she learned that she wasn\u2019t alone. At least five people in a Facebook group for the New Jersey equestrian community had received similar messages. Though the emails came from a variety of aliases, they all made the same request. In one, the sender, who self-identified as an \u201canimal lover who is open to experimental dating,\u201d offered to pay for the animal\u2019s care \u201cin exchange for an expectation of privacy for the relationship.\u201d\n\nAnother, which had been printed out and left in a farm\u2019s mailbox, expressed an interest in \u201cforming an intimate relationship with large farm animals such as horses ponies cows or similar\u201d and asked the owners to \u201cintroduce me to the partner of my dreams.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of the recipients said they were turning the messages over to the police, and some said that ignoring the requests had led to retaliation. The self-described animal lover \u201creviewed over 50 barns with 1 star reviews because we \u2018did not answer his email,\u2019\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cSome real sickos. Luckily the reviews are down and we haven\u2019t heard from him/her since.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Decker was behind the alarming requests, since police haven\u2019t released any of the emails and letters that he is accused of sending. Charging documents obtained by NJ.com didn\u2019t explain how he became a suspect, but detailed how police had searched his home and found tire spikes identical to the ones found at the crime scene.\n\nThe investigators also wrote that they found two arrows with explosives attached, a .22-caliber gun that he had made himself, and jars of flash powder and other potentially explosive materials, which he said came from fireworks that he had dismantled. When questioned by police, Decker allegedly admitted to contacting the farms and asking to have sex with their animals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s detention hearing, Decker\u2019s attorney, Daniel Palazzo, said that the 31-year-old had never been in trouble with the law before and had a full-time job waiting for him, the Herald reported. He argued that the explosives were \u201cbasically firecrackers\u201d that his client didn\u2019t plan to use against anyone else, and that it wasn\u2019t clear whether the homemade gun even worked. But the judge was unconvinced, ordering Decker to be held in jail without bail until his next court appearance in November on the grounds that he presented a danger to the community.\n\nThe list of charges that Decker faces includes second-degree possession of explosives; second-degree possession of a destructive device to use unlawfully; fourth-degree procuring an animal in any kind of sexual manner or initiate any sexual conduct with an animal; fourth-degree threatening to commit aggravated assault; fourth-degree knowingly manufacturing firearms; and multiple cyber-harassment charges, the Herald reported. Prosecutors said on Wednesday that the investigation is ongoing.\n\nAD", "description": "Richard Decker allegedly used homemade spikes to destroy farmers\u2019 tires, threatened to beat a man\u2019s wife with a wooden stick, and wrote negative online reviews of farms and stables that turned down his proposition.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xKifrDIaCgdqQoc_d_6KDTzImYk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M4WQ32WJVNCHZOJFES2OMQMAFM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
