I don\u2019t want them to forget that, because it is. It\u2019s a mental health problem,\u201d Donald Trump said, following the El Paso massacre and another mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the people that pull the trigger, it\u2019s not the gun that pulls the trigger,\u201d he continued, echoing a favourite Republican talking point.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds\n\nStatistics show that other countries with stricter gun control measures suffer far lower levels of gun violence than the US.\n\nThe president has avoided questions about gun control since the shootings.\n\nIn August Mr Trump was asked if he would support banning high-capacity magazines, such as the one used by a shooter in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nHe dodged the question, and instead ranted about the closure of hospitals for people with mentally health problems.", "description": "The Trump administration is considering a proposal to combat mass shootings which suggests phones and smartwatches may be used to track people with mental health problems.The idea began with Bob Wright, a former NBC chairman and longtime Trump confidant, who first proposed creating a government research", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iGyF6GLwRvKPHgg9iCe9Tw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/19059d48a880cba6c329b3028920dfdd", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
