You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever reports from The New York Times have claimed the President\u2019s drive to create a spectacle out of the accord had left the Taliban unwilling to proceed - and that officials from the militant group would only accept the terms if the deal was signed off before the meeting in America.\n\nThe agreement between the group and the US was struck in Doha, Qatar, by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad over the course of a year. The settlement would have seen the remaining 140,000 US troops pull out of Afghanistan over the next 16 months - keeping the president\u2019s 2016 campaign pledge to withdraw from the country - in return for assurances the Taliban would not house international terror groups as it did al-Qaeda in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Afghani government were also not willing to accept the Trump administration using the release of Taliban prisoners in Afghani custody as potential leverage for the deal.\n\nThe accord was finally terminated by the American President after the Taliban claimed an attack that killed 12 people, including a US soldier. The death is reported to have unified the administration\u2019s belief it should be cancelled - with mr Trump telling aides \u201cThis is off; we can\u2019t do this,\u201d, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe Taliban has since warned that Mr Trump\u2019s decision would \u201charm America more than anyone else\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for the militant group said talks had been completed \u201cin a favourable atmosphere\u201d, adding that the scrapping of the deal \u201charm America more than anyone else... will damage their status, will make it clear to the world its most hostile stance for peace, will increase its material and human losses, and its role will be known as shaky and fragile in political dealings\u201d.", "description": "A tentative peace deal between Taliban leaders and the US fell apart after Donald Trump moved to make the accord a spectacle as part of his re-election campaign, reports have suggested.", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/08/08/donald-trump-border-wall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
