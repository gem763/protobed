Billions are at stake.\n\nAccording to The New York Times' Michael de la Merced, Andrew Ross Sorkin and David Gelles, the motivating factor behind the conspiracy to dethrone Neumann is that major money managers refuse to invest in a WeWork IPO unless a different, more experienced operator is brought in.\n\nIf he doesn't go willingly, getting rid of Neumann won't be easy. He has been allowed to accumulate a lot of power. Even though his 20X voting shares have been knocked down to 10X following public backlash, Neumann still has enough control to fire his entire board if he wants to.\n\nPerhaps more significantly, WeWork's board needs to take a hard look in the mirror. Each member has failed miserably at their job. And that's because startup boardrooms are broken.\n\nA public company's board of directors is supposed to look out for shareholder interest.\n\nBut the job of a startup's board is less clear-cut and more problematic. These boards are often clubby groups of VC insiders. Their unspoken primary objective is to look out for their own self-interest and to protect their returns.\n\nFrom the earliest stages of a startup, investors back founders, not companies.\n\nThat's because ideas alone are worthless. It takes a founder with grit, vision and the ability to execute to transform a good idea into a billion-dollar business.\n\nVCs know that without someone like Adam Neumann at the helm, someone who is said to be one heck of a salesman, WeWork's valuation would be worth nowhere near $47 billion.\n\nThe visionary founder is considered so integral to the ultimate success of a startup that the board lets them get away with a lot. Business metrics get ignored, while the founder's power grows. Investors are not incentivized to push back while a startup is on the rise. If they do, they're viewed as being anti-founder \u2014 a bad reputation to have in the startup world. And after all, this is their cash cow. With no Neumann, there's no $47 billion pot of gold.\n\nSo there go all the checks and balances. Neumann, for all his excesses, is just the culmination of a trend that's been going on for years. The all-powerful startup founder has free reign to do almost anything they want, short of murder.\n\nUntil a startup gets so big that the public starts paying attention.\n\nKeep in mind that by the time today's startups IPO, they have grown into giant entities \u2014 like WeWork, Uber or Airbnb \u2014 whose business practices and operations affect entire industries. At that point the public, whether it be Wall Street investors or other stakeholders, starts doing the board of directors' job for them \u2014 questioning the sustainability of the business, and the practices of the CEO.\n\nAnd suddenly, the board is in a tight spot. Now billions are on the line if they don't turn against the founder who made the company what it is.\n\nThere's only been one recent example of a board successfully overthrowing a powerful visionary founder: Uber's Travis Kalanick. That ouster was driven largely by Bill Gurley, a partner at venture capital firm Benchmark who felt billions were on the line for himself and his LPs if he didn't make a drastic leadership change at Uber.\n\nBenchmark is also on the board of WeWork.\n\nKalanick's ouster took six months and a ferocious mental chess game before Kalanick willingly gave up his CEO role. It was ugly.\n\nWith Neumann, the WeWork board is already apparently contemplating digging into things like alleged drug use and mismanagement of company funds to force his hand, if he doesn't step aside.\n\nMaybe Neumann should fire his entire board.\n\nIt's either them or him, and it's debatable which is worse.", "description": "WeWork's board of directors is reportedly thinking about ways to replace Adam Neumann as CEO.
