REUTERS/Gleb Garanich/File Photo\n\nBut on the streets of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, people said they were either unfazed or merely disappointed by a politician they said they knew was short on experience and likely to struggle against more experienced political operators.\n\nZelenskiy, a former comedian and political novice who was only elected in April, was blindsided on Wednesday when the White House released a memo summarizing his July 25 call with Trump during which the U.S. leader asked him to investigate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nThe memo shows Zelenskiy promised to reopen an investigation into a company that employed Biden\u2019s son and voiced frustration about what he said was a lack of support from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron when it came to enforcing sanctions on Russia.\n\nIt also showed Zelenskiy had agreed with Trump that the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine - Marie Yovanovitch - was \u201ca bad ambassador\u201d and had Zelenskiy boasting that Ukraine\u2019s new prosecutor general would \u201c100%\u201d be his person.\n\nFormer Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and his party said on Thursday that the call showed Zelenskiy was an irresponsible custodian of the country\u2019s foreign policy and accused him of upsetting key allies.\n\nThey also questioned his commitment to a genuinely independent judiciary and demanded that the prosecutor general appear before parliament to explain whether he was Zelenskiy\u2019s puppet or a genuine \u201cservant of the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cEuropean Solidarity notes with deep concern that such inadvertent and ill-advised statements by the president may complicate Ukraine\u2019s international support,\u201d Poroshenko\u2019s party said in a statement.\n\nIt said it wanted Zelenskiy to maintain Ukraine\u2019s bipartisan support in the United States and retain the support of European allies.\n\n\u201cDiplomacy and international relations do not forgive amateurism, they need a thoughtful attitude and professional approach,\u201d the party said.\n\nU.S. congressional Democrats launched an inquiry to impeach Trump over allegations he pressed Zelenskiy to help smear Biden, the front-runner in the race to challenge Trump at presidential elections next year.\n\nOrdinary Ukrainians in Kiev on Thursday were more understanding of Zelenskiy.\n\n\u201cMy attitude toward Zelenskiy has not changed,\u201d said Irina Belyayeva, who said she was on maternity leave from work.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have unrealistic expectations. His lack of experience and a good team who could have advised him so that we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation has been confirmed. Many things were said which shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy enjoys a popularity rating over 70% and his Servant of the People party controls parliament with many Ukrainians hoping he can refashion their country into a fully fledged transparent graft-free democracy.\n\nSome Ukrainians said his Trump phone call showed he was trying to do his best to keep a powerful ally on side and that he hadn\u2019t known it would one day be made public.\n\nBohdan Telenko, a writer, said he thought the sudden flurry of media attention in Ukraine was welcome even if it was for the wrong reasons. But he said Zelenskiy had been shown to be out of his depth.\n\n\u201cI am worried a bit about Zelenskiy\u2019s lack of experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are sharks out there.\u201d", "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's political opponents rebuked him on Thursday over what they said was his amateurish handling of a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing him of damaging important international alliances.", "authors": ["Sergiy Karazy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434225624&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1DS", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
