And while we can\u2019t say we saw this one coming, we\u2019re on board (a little carpenter humor for Scott) with the unexpected pairing.\n\nHollywoodLife snapped photos of the potential couple heading to dinner at Little Dom\u2019s restaurant in Silver Lake, California. Not only did they smile for pictures, but Deschanel and Scott also held hands. They didn\u2019t try to hide their affection once at the restaurant either. According to the outlet, \u201cZooey and Jonathan kept looking at each other and smiling and sat closely, cuddling constantly throughout their meal. They looked very happy and casual.\u201d\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nBut hey, maybe they\u2019re just\u2026 really close friends? Well, it started that way, per HollywoodLife\u2019s inside source. The two met \u2014 and sparks flew \u2014 while shooting an episode of James Corden\u2019s popular Carpool Karaoke last month, and things took off from there. \u201cThey\u2019ve been out a few times and seem to want to keep the romance on the quieter side,\u201d said the source, adding, \u201cThey seem to like each other and Jonathan travels a lot, but they see one another when they can. They both seem pretty happy and into it so far.\u201d\n\nPeople corroborates the couple theory, with their source also confirming that Deschanel and Scott are romantically involved. \u201cIt\u2019s new, but they are having a lot of fun together,\u201d the source claimed.\n\nEarlier this month, Deschanel and her producer husband Jacob Pechenik announced they were separating, insisting in a joint statement that they are \u201cbetter off as friends, business partners and co-parents rather than life partners.\u201d They had reportedly been separated for months prior to publicly revealing their split.\n\nDeschanel and Pechenik have emphasized that they remain committed to amicably co-parenting their two children, Elsie, 4, and Charlie, 2.\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
