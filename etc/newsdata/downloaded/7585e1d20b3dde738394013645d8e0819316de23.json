Sullivan, often shifting in his chair to face the judge as he asked for a chance to someday walk free.\n\nAD\n\nGone was the cocky 30-something who once defiantly told a jury that he never forced anyone to use crack and that if he did not provide the drugs, \u201csomeone else would.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNow 54 and balding, having spent 30 years in prison, he spoke of mentoring troubled youth, regrets of \u201cletting down\u201d his loved ones and community, and his hope of reconnecting with his family.\n\n\u201cIf I am released, I would love to go back to into the community to help kids change themselves. I feel like I would be making up for my wrongs, to get people to go down a different path from me,\u201d Edmond said.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Edmond has cooperated with authorities for two decades, helping them convict other drug dealers and investigate murder cases and, in exchange, deserves to have his life sentence cut short. They have asked that his sentence be reduced to 40 years.\n\nAD\n\nEdmond\u2019s lawyer, Jason Downs, argued that his client deserves a much bigger break: a 15-year sentence. If Sullivan agrees, some of Edmond\u2019s time behind bars would then be applied to a separate 30-year sentence he has yet to begin serving for dealing drugs out of a prison in Pennsylvania. Prosecutors there say they have not decided if they will seek a reduction in that sentence.\n\nAD\n\nSullivan, a D.C. native, called the case among \u201cthe most difficult and challenging\u201d of his judicial career. Members of Edmond\u2019s family and spectators filled his courtroom Wednesday.\n\nA day before the hearing, new details about Edmond\u2019s life in prison, his drug-selling career and his years as an informant were made public in 79 pages of court documents that Sullivan ordered unsealed.\n\nAD\n\nThe documents provided an inside glimpse into Edmond\u2019s world, how he worked with prosecutors and police, and how authorities sought to keep the extent of that ongoing relationship secret for his protection.\n\nEdmond was once held under an assumed name in a local jail in Pennsylvania. Another time, he was placed in solitary for six months, which \u201chelped convince the inmates that he was not cooperating and that he was being punished by prison officials,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nAD\n\nEdmond provided information that allowed authorities to obtain multiple wire taps and to secure convictions of more than 100 drug dealers. He helped authorities solve two murders that occurred in the prison where he was housed.\n\nAD\n\nOn the witness stand Wednesday, retired FBI agent Steve Benjamin recalled meeting Edmond in 1994 and confronting him about his drug dealing behind bars. He said Edmond broke into tears, shocking him and his colleagues.\n\n\u201cIt was the most extraordinary moment of my career,\u201d said Benjamin, who had started at the FBI in the 1970s. \u201cWe were all stunned. He told us he was ready to stop [dealing drugs] but didn\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\nBenjamin testified that he told Edmond then he would not be able to offer any type of incentive for his cooperation. \u201cBut I told him I could offer him an opportunity to be able to sleep at night for the first time in his life. He realized he was in over his head and this was his only way out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to his other help, Edmond revealed loopholes in an inmate phone system that allowed him to deal drugs from within the prison, and he worked with authorities to overhaul it.\n\nTwo preachers and a D.C. youth leader spoke at the hearing about how, in 1997, Edmond telephoned from prison into a meeting to mediate a peace treaty between two rival teenage gangs in Southeast Washington.\n\nEdmond, steered by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Dominguez during monthly telephone conversations over a period of years, provided authorities details about the lives of murder suspects and victims, describing street rivalries and friendships that helped focus investigations.\n\nAD\n\nDominguez wrote in one draft filing that detectives had \u201cclosed out several\u201d homicides with Edmond\u2019s help but that there was \u201cno official way\u201d of counting such closures or how the cases were closed. Last week, the new lead prosecutor on Edmond\u2019s resentencing, John Crabb Jr., wrote in a filing that Edmond\u2019s information never led to any arrests.\n\nAD\n\nThe newly released documents, which date more than a decade, detail how Dominguez in recent years had pushed for a bigger break for Edmond than the 40-year sentence the U.S. attorney\u2019s office ultimately requested. In an undated draft motion, Domin\u00adguez wrote that Edmond\u2019s sentence should be immediately cut short to the time he already had served.\n\nDowns contends those communications amount to a promise by federal prosecutors that should be honored. In a motion, he argued the U.S. attorney\u2019s office delayed seeking a reduction for fear of \u201cpotential negative publicity or media attention.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut federal prosecutors say Dominguez made clear his drafts were merely recommendations that required approval from the U.S. attorney. U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu ultimately sought the resentencing, which was also considered by her two predecessors. Liu made a brief appearance at the hearing.\n\nAD\n\nIn one 2017 email to Edmond\u2019s attorneys, Dominguez wrote that \u201cthere is a considerable body of federal prosecutors \u2014 not all \u2014 who firmly believe that Rayful Edmond III deserves to die in prison.\u201d\n\nEdmond, who was convicted in the District in 1989, oversaw an operation that brought up to 1,700 pounds of cocaine a month into the city. At one point, law enforcement officials estimated he was raking in as much as $2 million a week. Authorities said his enforcers were linked to as many as 30 slayings, although Edmond was never convicted in any homicides.\n\nAD\n\nIn a Nov. 21, 2010, typed letter to Dominguez, Edmond outlined some of his work with authorities.\n\nHe first cooperated to secure the early release from prison of his mother, Constance \u201cBootsie\u201d Perry, who worked as part of his drug operation. In the courtroom during the hearing, Perry sat along with about 30 other members of Edmond\u2019s family.\n\nAD\n\nEdmond also wrote that in 1999, he was accepted into the federal witness protection program and then sent to a prison in Minnesota. \u201cFor the last 17 years, I have dedicated myself in helping assist many law enforcement agencies, in the metropolitan area of Virginia, Maryland and D.C. I will continue in my assistance until my cooperation is no longer needed,\u201d Edmond wrote.\n\nIn a filing that was never submitted to the court, Dominguez said that seeking a reduction to Edmond\u2019s sentence in the mid-1990s was not an option because the city \u201cwas still reeling from a dramatic increase in drug-related murders, which the media, politicians, community leaders and others attributed directly or indirectly to Edmond\u2019s introduction of crack cocaine.\u201d\n\nDominguez wrote that Edmond only continued to sell drugs out of the Pennsylvania prison because he feared that if he stopped, he would be killed in retaliation.\n\nAD\n\nIn court Wednesday, Domin\u00adguez spoke fondly of Edmond and repeatedly said how Edmond is a different person than the man he prosecuted in 1989.\n\n\u201cHe made a decision to show everyone that he had changed and that he was no longer the same 24-year-old that I prosecuted and who I argued in 1990 should be put in jail for life,\u201d Dominguez said.\n\nSullivan asked Edmond how he got into dealing drugs. \u201cBased on everything I read about you and your business acumen, you could have been the head of a distribution company somewhere like Amazon,\u201d the judge said.\n\nEdmond, who graduated from Dunbar High School, said he had been around drugs his entire life and \u201cchose the wrong path.\u201d\n\nSullivan said he will issue a written ruling in the coming weeks. He then asked Edmond if he was worried about his life should he be released.", "description": "Edmond, appearing in the District for the first time in 17 years, is seeking a reduction in his life sentence.", "authors": ["Keith L.
