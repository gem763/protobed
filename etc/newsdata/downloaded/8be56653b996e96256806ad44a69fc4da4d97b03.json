Just depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren't intellectual. They are a lot more than that. It's not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It's not. It's about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and it devalues us and how we're perceived in that way, or used as mascots. The Redskins and stuff like that.\"\n\nThe Braves subsequently released a statement saying they \"appreciate and take seriously\" Helsley's concerns.\n\nGoold added the franchise plans to make \"other changes during the in-game entertainment and fan interaction involving the 'chop'\" during Game 5.\n\nThe \"Tomahawk Chop\" originated in 1991 when Braves fans were cheering on Deion Sanders, who had played football for the Florida State Seminoles and who was also with the Atlanta Falcons at the time. The chant grew from there and became a staple at home games.\n\nIn January 2018, MLB announced the Cleveland Indians planned to discontinue wearing jerseys and hats with their Chief Wahoo logo starting with the 2019 season amid longstanding criticism it was a racist caricature. The Braves scrapped plans to use a batting practice hat with a similar logo in 2013.", "description": "The  Atlanta Braves  did not place foam tomahawks in fans' seats at SunTrust Park ahead of Game 5 of the National League Division Series on Wednesday, according to the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch 's  Derrick Goold ...", "authors": ["Joseph Zucker"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/832/296/hi-res-3c7c30fcb62534a6e3afebf07d39b0d2_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
