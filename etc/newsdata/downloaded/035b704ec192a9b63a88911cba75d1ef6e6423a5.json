The young escorts he had invited to his flat with the words 'We need to get this party started' were, in fact, professional decorators\n\nThe committee said paid-for sex between consenting adults was not illegal, but Mr Vaz's attempts to mislead the inquiry brought shame on him.\n\nCall me Jim\n\nThe inquiry by the standards commissioner concerned the evening of August 27, 2016, at a well-appointed \u00a3400,000 Edgware flat belonging to Mr Vaz, a 10-minute walk from his \u00a32.2million marital home.\n\nAs the rent boys undressed, one of them asked his name and the MP for Leicester East replied 'Jim', telling his Eastern European guests he was a washing machine repair man.\n\nAlas, the ruse was pointless because they were fully aware of his true identity and one of them was secretly recording the proceedings on his phone for the Sunday Mirror newspaper.\n\nEight days later, it published its expose, including extracts of the home affairs chairman \u2013 whose committee was tasked with monitoring crime, immigration and drugs policy on behalf of the nation \u2013 discussing illegal drugs, unprotected sex and money. He resigned as chairman days later.\n\nOnly now has Mr Vaz's 'implausible' version of events been made public, after the commissioner's inquiry finished and her findings were endorsed by the Commons' standards committee which published a report yesterday.\n\nIt tells how the MP insisted he and his wife had planned an 'ambitious' renovation at their house and needed to quickly refurbish the flat to serve as their temporary home.\n\nThe MP's wife of 26 years, Maria Fernandes, revealed in an interview with the Mail a week after the story broke how he had begged her for forgiveness. Mr Vaz and his wife Maria are pictured above in September 2016, a day after the revelations broke\n\nBecause of his crowded diary of engagements \u2013 which included a football match and a birthday party \u2013 he could not meet the 'decorators' until late in the evening on Saturday August 27.\n\nOn the Sunday Mirror's tape, Mr Vaz can allegedly be heard calling one of the men 'a naughty b****r', and informing him: 'I'm getting very horny.'\n\nYesterday the committee concluded: 'The notion that the men were at Mr Vaz's flat in connection with painting and decorating is incredible. The recording contains no evidence of any conversation about \u2026decorating.'\n\nPaid for sex\n\nCommissioner Kathryn Stone said: 'Mr Vaz has told me he has never paid for sex. Sexual activity took place...I believe Mr Vaz paid for that activity.'\n\nInitially, Mr Vaz tried to dismiss the Sunday Mirror's investigation as bearing 'no relation to what actually occurred'. But when asked by the commissioner what had really occurred, he pleaded amnesia. He claimed his drink must have been spiked\n\nMr Vaz and his visitors reminisced about other prostitutes including one who 'forgot the condom', with the MP recalling: 'I had to f*** him without a condom.'\n\nThe report said: 'No reasonable person who has listened to the audio recording could believe his claim that the purpose of the two men's visit was to discuss interior decoration. Mr Vaz's claims \u2026 are, frankly, ludicrous.'\n\nDrugs\n\nAs the trio waited for a third rent boy \u2013 a Romanian \u2013 Mr Vaz offered to buy him cocaine, the report found.\n\nThe MP \u2013 who in 2010 demanded action against the 'dangerous' cocaine trade \u2013 said he did not want any but would be willing to pay for the Romanian to have some, the tape revealed.\n\nThe report said: 'The men can be heard discussing 'poppers', 'weed' and 'coke'. Mr Vaz was the first to mention 'coke' that evening.'\n\nIn 2016, the Met examined the case but did not to take any action. Mr Vaz told the commissioner the recording could not be relied on and insisted he had never taken drugs.\n\nAmnesia\n\nInitially, Mr Vaz tried to dismiss the Sunday Mirror's investigation as bearing 'no relation to what actually occurred'.\n\nBut when asked by the commissioner what had really occurred, he pleaded amnesia. He claimed his drink must have been spiked.\n\nThe inquiry said the one-hour-40-minute recording proved he had not been incapacitated, as he spoke freely to the prostitutes.\n\nThe report said: 'He knew about their pet dog, the study plans of one of the men, their travels and their overdraft. These are not the details most people would know about their decorators.'\n\nThe commissioner found it 'extremely puzzling' that Mr Vaz did not wheel out his amnesia claims until later in the inquiry.\n\nShe added that the fact Mr Vaz was calling himself a false name also undermined his claims.\n\nHis wife\n\nThe MP's wife of 26 years, Maria Fernandes, revealed in an interview with the Mail a week after the story broke how he had begged her for forgiveness \u2013 contradicting Mr Vaz's claims he had not spoken to her, said the standards commissioner, who added: 'Mr Vaz's wife said that she said she had had no inkling that her husband enjoyed sex with men. The article said Mr Vaz had told his wife 'something was going to break [in a newspaper], that it was bad...While he did not go into detail, he did concede \u2013 to his wife's incredulity \u2013 that his infidelity involved men'.'\n\nHis excuses\n\nThe report said Mr Vaz 'has done himself no favours by his inability to provide a single, consistent, plausible account.'\n\nIt revealed the lengths he went to 'throw dust in the eyes of the commissioner and the committee', adding he 'has done his best to complicate, obfuscate and confuse the inquiry'.\n\nThe MP claimed he was the victim of conmen and produced a 'dossier' of claims about the rent boys, including that one had a 'conviction for littering from a vehicle'. This was rejected as irrelevant.\n\nHe claimed the Sunday Mirror's tape was 'doctored' but an independent expert found it was not.\n\nHe complained he was the victim of 'entrapment'. But the committee said the sting had not 'fostered' Mr Vaz's misconduct, but rather had exposed it.\n\nThe report said: 'There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Vaz was being steered in directions he was unwilling to go.'\n\nThe committee said it was 'difficult, to put it mildly' to accept his excuses. It said the inquiry could have been finished long ago if he had told the truth.", "description": "The committee said paid-for sex between consenting adults was not illegal, but Mr Vaz's attempts to mislead the inquiry brought shame on him.", "authors": ["Sam Greenhill For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/21/20300678-0-image-a-28_1572299792177.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
