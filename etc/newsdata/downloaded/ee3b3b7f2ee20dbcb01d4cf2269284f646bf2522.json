Everyone at some point gets involved in politics at their own level, but, for the moment, it doesn\u2019t interest me.\u201d\n\nThe 38-year-old Cameroon legend recently brought the curtain down on a glittering playing career during which he won the UEFA Champions League twice with Barcelona and once more with Inter Milan.\n\nAn idol in his homeland, Eto\u2019o gave his backing to Paul Biya \u2014 who has ruled the country for 37 years \u2014 before his re-election in 2018.\n\nBiya is 86 and is dealing with a major crisis in Cameroon as a two-year secession drive by anglophone separatists has claimed thousands of lives.\n\nMain opposition leader Maurice Kamto walked free from jail earlier this month after a military court ordered his release at Biya\u2019s behest.\n\nOf his supposed political ambitions, Eto\u2019o added: \u201cA lot of people might be saying that it\u2019s an idea I have, but I say to them it doesn\u2019t exist in my mind at the moment.\n\n\u201cBut every citizen has the right. If you want to stand, nobody is going to stop you. But in our country it is as though it is something reserved for certain people. Personally it is not an objective.\u201d\n\nThe two-time Africa Cup of Nations winner says he wants to move into coaching, although he has also taken a role with the Confederation of African Football.\n\n\u201cMy role is to lobby the different federations to convince them to adhere to the work being done by president (Ahmad) Ahmad,\u201d he said.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Samuel Eto\u2019o is up there with George Weah as an African great on the football field, but he says he has no plans to follow the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/a58cb6_samuel-eto-he-has-no-plans-go-politics-retiring-playing-in-september-cameroon-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
