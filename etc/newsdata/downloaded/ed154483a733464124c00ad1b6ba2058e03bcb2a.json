But when people hear \u201cGodfather of Tennessee whiskey,\u201d they are left scratching their head.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFawn Weaver, the CEO of Uncle Nearest Whiskey, is working to change that.\n\nWeaver, a New York Times Best-Selling author, was set to write her next book about Nathan Green, known to family and friends as \u201cUncle Nearest.\u201d Nearest was a former Tennessee slave who taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey and is credited as Daniel\u2019s first master distiller.\n\n\u201cWe know what Tennessee whiskey is because of Jack Daniels, and so we don\u2019t take away the title \u2018Father of Tennessee Whiskey\u2019 from him, but Nearest Green is definitely the Godfather of Tennessee whiskey,\u201d said Weaver.\n\nWeaver wanted to ensure that Nearest\u2019s legacy was engrained in history and memory. She did not want his story to go unknown for another 200 years. Weaver said she had an epiphany from the book and movie \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d the forgotten or \u201chidden\u201d story of three black women who changed the course of history.\n\nA month after she saw the movie Weaver found herself forgetting the names of the main characters.\n\n\u201cI ask people all the time, \u2018Can you name any of them?\u2019 and no one can.\u201d The moment became a breakthrough for Weaver, who completely changed the direction of her project to memorialize Nearest.\n\n\u201cI realized that a book and a movie would not be the medium to ensure that Nearest\u2019s name was going to live on, it had to be something that would be here 200-years from now. It had to be whiskey.\u201d\n\nWeaver established Uncle Nearest 1856 Premium Whiskey in 2017. The entrepreneur and author quickly learned that Nearest\u2019s legacy was truly seeped into every sip of Tennessee whiskey, and that Green\u2019s process of whiskey-making distinguishes Kentucky bourbon from Tennessee whiskey.\n\n\u201cIt is taking a traditional whiskey mash and running it through sugar maple charcoal and filtering it that way, and that is not common for any other spirit except Tennessee whiskey. It\u2019s why we say he\u2019s the Godfather of Tennessee whiskey.\u201d\n\nWeaver\u2019s business is working to memorialize the master distiller\u2019s memory, and that means putting Uncle Nearest Whiskey on as many shelves as possible.\n\nAccording to Weaver, \u201cUncle Nearest is one of the fastest growing independent spirit brands in American history, period.\u201d Currently, Uncle Nearest Whiskey can be found in nearly 6,000 stores, bars and restaurants. The company has expanded into all 50 states and 10 countries-with shipping available to 148 countries.\n\nThis rapid expansion, explained Weaver, is another aspect that makes her company unique.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really never seen anything like this in the whiskey business\u2014most whiskey brands would hope to be in their home state and maybe an adjoining state within two years, but we\u2019re not most brands,\u201d said Weaver, smiling.\n\nUncle Nearest\u2019s legacy sets Weaver\u2019s company apart from any other that has come before it. She tells Fox Business, \u201cWhat was amazing when I first started in the whiskey business is that I didn\u2019t realize that this was the first American spirit ever to commemorate an African-American. Ever. Can you imagine? We\u2019ve been here 400 years, and ours is the very first.\u201d\n\nUncle Nearest\u2019s descendants, at first skeptical, have been won over. Victoria Eady-Butler is a great-great-granddaughter of Nearest, and a shareholder of Uncle Nearest and its director of administration.\n\n\u201cWhen Fawn first agreed to shine a light on our ancestor by putting his name on a bottle two years ago, I never could have imagined where Uncle Nearest would be now,\u201d said Eady-Butler.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHighlighting diversity and creating an inclusive work environment remain pillars of Uncle Nearest Whiskey. Weaver attributes the success of her company to another black American who changed the fabric of American culture\u2014Motown founder Berry Gordy.\n\n\u201cUncle Nearest follows what I like to call \u2018the Motown way\u2019 and bringing people to the table that may not have ordinarily thought they were welcome. We\u2019re saying everybody is welcome to raise a glass to Nearest Green.\u201d\n\nWeaver knows first-hand about Motown and the \u2018Motown way.\u2019 Her father was the legendary singer, songwriter, and producer Frank Wilson. Weaver told Fox Business that she is emulating Gordy\u2019s business strategy. She explained that, before Motown, everyone was either marketing white music or marketing black music, but Berry Gordy wanted to create music that brought everyone together.\n\nWeaver described a childhood where she was accustomed to being surrounded by successful black Americans.\n\n\u201cI came up in a house where you got Smokey [Robinson] and Stevie [Wonder] walking through the door, Marilyn McCoo coming up at any moment, and you're calling all these guys \u2018aunt\u2019 and \u2018uncle\u2019\u201d said Weaver. \u201cI only knew the sky's the limit, and I never understood the concept of a glass ceiling, because if the sky's the limit, then there can't be a glass ceiling.\u201d\n\nAccording to Weaver, being in a household where her father was a part of writing that music that brought people together has been a guiding principle that has stuck with her and which she incorporates into her business strategy today.\n\n\u201cUncle Nearest is the Motown of whiskey,\u201d she said \u201cNow, I have the pleasure of having a whiskey company that's doing the exact same thing that Berry Gordy did, where we're bringing people to the table that may not ordinarily sit around a table together, but because of Nearest and because they want to raise a glass to him, they're all sitting side-by-side no matter the race or gender.\u201d\n\nUncle Nearest Whiskey even ranks as the first major spirit brand led by all-minority board of directors and the first major spirit brand led by all-female executive team. Weaver stressed that her company does not discriminate at the top, they\u2019re just using their power to do \u201cwhat the boys have always done.\u201d\n\nEady-Butler told Fox Business that Nearest would be surprised by the success tied to his name.\n\n\u201cIf my great-great-grandfather were alive today, I know how proud he would be to see us keeping his legacy alive and probably would not even believe himself that people around the world now know his name and what he\u2019s done for whiskey history. \u201c\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nWeaver has continued to make unprecedented headway in breaking new business boundaries for Uncle Nearest. Her company\u2019s new Tennessee distillery opened to the public in September, further ensuring the world never forgets where the Tennessee whiskey legacy all started.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this whiskey, is that it\u2019s about more than the whiskey,\u201d explained Weaver. \u201cEvery single time someone\u2019s pouring from the bottle, they\u2019re telling Nearest\u2019s name, and I\u2019m seeing it more and more around the world. I\u2019m seeing it because people now know who he is.\u201d\n\nEmily DeCiccio is a video producer and reporter for Fox News Digital Originals.
