(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)\n\nThe authors omit the fact that the alleged victim has no memory of the alleged incident.\n\nIf you opened Twitter on Sunday morning, you were likely greeted with the bombshell headline of the top trending news story: \u201cNYT reporters\u2019 book details new sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nThe allegation, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly write in a New York Times story adapted from their forthcoming anti-Kavanaugh book, is this: \u201cWe also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait a second. Who did what to whom?\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s \u201cfriends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student\u201d?\n\nCan someone explain the logistics of the allegation here? Was Kavanaugh allegedly walking around naked when his friends pushed him into the female student?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, if I\u2019m reading Pogrebin and Kelly right, the friends didn\u2019t push Kavanaugh in the back. Rather, the \u201cfriends pushed his penis.\u201d\n\nWhat? How does that happen? Who are the friends? Who is the female student? Were there any witnesses besides Stier?\n\nAll that the authors write in the New York Times essay about corroborating the story is this: \u201cMr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. (We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.)\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo they corroborated the fact that Stier made the allegation to the FBI, but the authors give no indication that they have corroborated any details of the alleged incident.\n\nThe book isn\u2019t released until Tuesday, but Mollie Hemingway got a copy, and she writes on Twitter: \u201cThe book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event.\u201d Omitting this fact from the New York Times story is one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you take this confusing accusation in the essay at face value, it doesn\u2019t even appear to be an allegation of assault against Kavanaugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201cfriends pushed his penis,\u201d then isn\u2019t it an allegation of wrongdoing against Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201cfriends,\u201d not Kavanaugh himself? Surely even a modern liberal Yalie who\u2019s been to one of those weird non-sexual \u201cnaked parties\u201d would recognize both the female student and Kavanaugh are both alleged victims in this alleged incident, barring an additional allegation that a college-aged Kavanaugh asked his \u201cfriends\u201d to \u201cpush his penis.\u201d\n\nThe new allegation is supposed to help lend credence to the on-the-record allegation that Kavanaugh\u2019s Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez made in 2018. Pogrebin and Kelly sum up Ramirez\u2019s allegation: \u201cShe and some classmates had been drinking heavily when, she says, a freshman named Brett Kavanaugh pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it. Some of the onlookers, who had been passing around a fake penis earlier in the evening, laughed.\u201d\n\nPogrebin and Kelly downplay Ramirez\u2019s own doubts about whether Kavanaugh did what she now alleges, choosing rather to lard up their New York Times story with details that are supposed to demonstrate how under-privileged Ramirez was: She had to sell ice cream during the summer in high school, bought a cheap car, and only had an above-ground swimming pool as a teenager (the horror).\n\nNone of these details corroborates her accusation against Kavanaugh. But the story is framed to make it seem like Kavanaugh was the type of privileged jerk who might expose himself in front of an under-privileged college classmate.\n\nAs I wrote last October, here\u2019s why Ramirez\u2019s allegation was dubious:\n\nDeborah Ramirez is the Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s who now claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself as a college freshman at a party. Ramirez\u2019s claim was already dubious because (1) named eyewitnesses deny the allegation and (2) Ramirez herself wasn\u2019t sure in recent weeks if Kavanaugh had done what she now alleges. \u201cMs. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself,\u201d the New York Times reported. Ramirez was only willing to make the allegation, the New Yorker reported, after \u201csix days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney.\u201d\n\nPogrebin and Kelly write that a couple of students say they had heard about the alleged incident in the days after it allegedly occurred, but the authors provide no indication there is any first-hand witness to corroborate the allegation.\n\nWe already knew before Kavanaugh was confirmed last October that the \u201ccorroborating\u201d source for Ramirez\u2019s claim, classmate Kenneth Appold, was not present when the alleged incident occurred, but Appold told the New Yorker he was \u201cone-hundred-percent-sure\u201d he heard about it from an eyewitness. Shortly before Kavanaugh was confirmed, the New Yorker reported that Appold\u2019s supposed eyewitness \u201csaid that he had no memory of the incident.\u201d\n\nMaybe Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book is stronger than their essay. But I\u2019m skeptical. \u201cIn the end they turn up no smoking gun,\u201d Hanna Rosin writes in her New York Times review of the book.", "description": "Maybe Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book is stronger than their essay, but I\u2019m skeptical.", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Andrew C.
