A place where peace is a very expensive commodity, and I am sure it will give us energy to work towards peace and to realise peace within our region,\u201d Abiy said in a phone call posted on the Nobel Prize website.\n\nThis is the second year in a row that an African has received the Nobel Peace Prize, after Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege shared the 2018 honour with Yazidi activist Nadia Murad for their work combatting sexual violence.\n\nOn Friday, Mukwege congratulated his fellow laureate.\n\n\u201cYour efforts for reconciliation in the horn of Africa have been inspiring well beyond borders,\u201d he said in a Twitter post.\n\nSince taking office in April 2018, the 43-year-old Abiy has aggressively pursued policies that have the potential to upend society in the Horn of Africa nation and reshape dynamics beyond its borders, after years of civil unrest.\n\nOn July 9, 2018, following a historic meeting in Eritrea\u2019s capital Asmara, Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki formally ended a 20-year-old stalemate between the countries in the wake of the 1998-2000 border conflict.\n\nAbiy has since released dissidents from jail, apologised for state brutality, and welcomed home exiled armed groups.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Winds of hope\u2019 \u2013\n\nHis actions have sparked optimism in a region of Africa marred by violence.\n\n\u201cI have said often that winds of hope are blowing ever stronger across Africa. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is one of the main reasons why,\u201d UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said.\n\nThe peace agreement with Eritrea has \u201copened up new opportunities for the region to enjoy security and stability\u201d, and Abiy\u2019s \u201cleadership has set a wonderful example for others in and beyond Africa looking to overcome resistance from the past and put people first\u201d.\n\nThe Nobel jury stressed the Peace Prize was \u201calso meant to recognise all the stakeholders working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the East and Northeast African regions\u201d.\n\nIt singled out the Eritrean leader, noting that \u201cpeace does not arise from the actions of one party alone\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed reached out his hand, President Afwerki grabbed it, and helped to formalise the peace process between the two countries.\u201d\n\nHowever analysts believe there is still some way to go before a lasting peace, and the enthusiasm has been mixed with frustration.\n\nThe border between the two countries has once again been closed, the countries still lack trade agreements and Ethiopia \u2014 a land-locked country \u2014 still has no access to Eritrean ports.\n\nAmnesty International said the prize should spur Abiy to enhance reforms on human rights, pointing to \u201congoing ethnic tensions that threaten instability\u201d.\n\nEthnic violence has been on the rise in recent years, causing Ethiopia to record more internally displaced people last year than any other country.\n\n\u2013 Push in the right direction \u2013\n\nRecognising that some would consider the prize premature, the Nobel Committee said that while much remained to be done, the award should serve as encouragement, and pointed to the criteria set by prize creator Alfred Nobel \u2014 namely that the award should go to one \u201cwho has made the most significant contribution to peace within the past year\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that by far this is Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and we are also hopeful that the peace prize could perhaps be a push on the peace initiatives in the right direction,\u201d Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told AFP.\n\nHowever, some Eritrean human rights activists were critical of the decision, seeing in it an implicit endorsement of the Eritrean regime \u2014 which the democracy advocacy group Freedom House ranks as one of the most repressive in the world.\n\n\u201cThe Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to a man who has befriended and whitewashed a dictator next door for his nation\u2019s own interests whilst prolonging the suffering of the Eritrean people,\u201d democracy activist, and niece of jailed Eritrean journalist Seyoum Tsehaye, Vanessa Tsehaye wrote on Twitter.\n\nThis year\u2019s prize will be presented at a ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of Alfred Nobel, who was a Swedish philanthropist and scientist.\n\nThe award consists of a gold medal, a diploma, and nine million Swedish kronor (around $912,000 or 828,000 euros).", "description": "Oslo (AFP) \u2013 Hailed as a visionary and reformer, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for his efforts to resolve", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/1ada93_ethiopia-prime-minister-abiy-ahmed-is-africa-youngest-leader-ethiopia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
