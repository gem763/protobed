In fact, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence goes so far as to claim that the recent moves are evidence of a cultural shift towards gun control.\n\n. @WalmartInc announces it will stop selling high capacity ammo, end open carry in stores@kroger announces it will end open carry in its stores@NASCAR rejects advertising for semi automatic assault weapons on cars Do you feel that? The cultural ground is shifting beneath us. \u2014 Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (@CSGV) September 4, 2019\n\nAs much as CSGV and gun control groups really want to de-normalize gun ownership, what they\u2019re noticing is a corporate shift, not a cultural one. As it turns out, Americans are still very interested in exercising their 2A rights, as this Montana story notes.\n\nIn the last decade, concealed handgun permits have increased in the United States by an estimated 273 percent. The Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s Office says there\u2019s currently 3,809 active concealed carry permit holders in the county, and that number is growing. \u201cThis year, to give you an idea, we\u2019re projected to have over 1,000 men put in for a concealed weapons permits, compared to the 300 that are women,\u201d said Sheriff Brian Gootkin.\n\nIn 2015, Gallatin County, Montana saw 67 women apply for their concealed carry license. In 2018, that number had jumped to 285. And this isn\u2019t just happening in rural Montana. Concealed carry classes are packed in El Paso, Texas these days, according to Michael McIntyre of the El Paso gun store Gun Central.\n\n\u201cI have over 50 for this Saturday class and approximately the same amount for the Sunday class, and I normally have approximately seven,\u201d McIntyre told Reuters. In addition to an increase in a desire for training, McIntyre said his handgun sales doubled following the attack. \u201cWe actually had two people buy guns here who were actually in the Walmart on the day of the shooting. The other people are just saying, \u2018Hey, you know I want to be able to protect myself in the event of something going on.\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the last mass shooting we\u2019re going to see.\u201d\n\nGun prohibitionists may be cheered by the recent moves from large corporations like Walmart and Kroger, but getting skittish companies to ban open carry (while leaving their policies towards concealed carry untouched) is more a sign of a changing corporate landscape than any indication of a change amongst the American people. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t see similar moves by other companies (the New York Times, for instance, says Walmart\u2019s decision to stop carrying handgun and some rifle ammunition is a guide for other retailers to follow), but as the Left loves to remind us, corporations aren\u2019t people.\n\nThere are an estimated 100,000,000 gun-owning Americans in this country. As of 2018, there were more than 17,000,000 concealed carry licensees, and that number has undoubtably increased over the last year. That figure also doesn\u2019t take into account the millions of Americans who now live in states where no license is needed for legal gun owners to carry a firearm. Americans who own guns cut across every demographic boundary you can dream up, from age, race, gender, religion, political affiliation, to geographic location. Gun owners are white collar, blue collar, and no collar. They\u2019re driving Teslas and pickup trucks, eating ribeye steaks and tofu burgers, and listening to Taylor Swift and Tool. There is no such thing as a stereotypical gun owner in this country any more than there\u2019s a stereotypical American, but there are lots of \u201cnormal\u201d gun owners.\n\nCorporate wokeness will only get the gun prohibitionists so far. 20 years ago, the NYTimes declared that Walmart\u2019s standards for selling CD\u2019s were \u201cchanging pop music\u201d. The retailer refused to carry CD\u2019s with explicit material or parental advisory stickers, and supposedly that was going to lead to a new, more sanitized pop music scene. Fast forward to 2019 and the current Billboard Hot 100 has songs with the following lyrics in the Top 10.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ma hit you back in a minute\n\nI don\u2019t play tag, bitch, I been it\n\nWe don\u2019t f*** with lies, we don\u2019t do goodbyes\n\nWe just keep it pushing like aye yi yi\u201d \u2013 Lizzo, \u201cTruth\u201d \u201cThey see me blowing up, now they say they want some\n\nI got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer\n\nI see two twin opps, leave \u2019em on the banner\n\nAnd I got two thick thots, wanna lick the gang, yeah\u201d \u2013 Lil Tecca, \u201cRan$om\u201d \u201cBefore I die I\u2019m tryna f*** you, baby\n\nHopefully we don\u2019t have no babies\n\nI don\u2019t even wanna go back home\n\nHopefully, I don\u2019t leave you on your own\u201d \u2013 Chris Brown featuring Drake, \u201cNo Guidance\u201d\n\nGolly gee whillikers, I sure am glad Walmart was around to clean up pop music 20 years ago. Who knows what would be popular if the retailer hadn\u2019t cracked down on explicit lyrics?\n\nA corporate-driven crackdown on the 2nd Amendment isn\u2019t the same as a cultural crackdown. While Walmart\u2019s decision to remove handgun ammunition will undoubtably have some impact, particularly for rural Americans, it doesn\u2019t translate to a cultural embrace of gun prohibition policies, any more than the company\u2019s decision to not carry explicit music meant that Americans wanted their pop music to sound like Air Supply. In fact, given the innate rebellious nature of Americans (as evidenced by everything from Prohibition to the civil rights movement to the Tea Party to today\u2019s #Resist), it\u2019s likely that the more corporate America tries to stigmatize legal gun ownership, more Americans will be prompted to explore and exercise their 2nd Amendment rights.", "description": "Gun control groups are taking a victory lap after Kroger joined Walmart in announcing it will ask customers not to\u00a0openly carry firearms\u00a0in their stores.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/143/065e8718-5463-4a21-a64d-f365368f43ef.png"}
