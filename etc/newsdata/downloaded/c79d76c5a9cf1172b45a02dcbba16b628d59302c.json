It was only having her sister with her that saved her life.\n\n\u201cWe feel so lucky to have them both. Elsie still looks after Edie now \u2013 and it\u2019s a role that began in the womb, long before they were born.\u201d\n\nThe couple were thrilled when they found out Emily was expecting identical twins. However, when she was 16 weeks pregnant, doctors had devastating news.\n\nEdie\u2019s umbilical cord was only slightly inserted into the end of the placenta, meaning there was a high chance she would die in the womb because she wasn\u2019t getting enough nutrients.\n\n(Image: Mark Pinder)\n\nEmily said: \u201cIt was such a shock when the doctors told us what was wrong.\n\n\u201cWe had been so thrilled when we found out I was having twins, so to be told now that Edie may not make it was devastating.\u201d\n\nThe condition is called Vasa Previa. It means the umbilical cord has only a tenuous link with the placenta.\n\nIf Emily had fallen pregnant with just Edie then the baby wouldn\u2019t have survived.\n\nAfter raising the alert, doctors gave the couple a heartrendingly difficult choice. Emily said: \u201cThey told us we could sever Edie\u2019s cord and sacrifice\n\nher to save Elsie.\n\n\u201cIt would give her a better chance of survival \u2013 because if Edie died, then Elsie\u2019s life would then be at risk too.\n\n\u201cWe said definitely not. I just wanted to let nature take its course.\n\n(Image: Mark Pinder)\n\n\u201cWe had never heard of this condition. When we found out I was\n\npregnant with twins we had been thrilled. We never imagined we would be facing such a situation with them.\u201d\n\nEmily was scanned weekly and little Edie hung on.\n\nThen, 26 weeks into the pregnancy, doctors told the couple something remarkable was happening.\n\nBecause Elsie\u2019s umbilical cord was in the right place and fully inserted into the placenta, it was keeping the blood flow going around the organ, which was helping Edie get some blood and nutrients too.\n\nEmily went on: \u201cIt was amazing when they said that Elsie\u2019s cord was helping to keep Edie alive too. It was really remarkable.\n\n\u201cIt was only because her sister was in the womb too that Edie was staying alive. We couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nTwins have a bond between them, but the bond between our girls was incredibly strong. One was keeping the other alive even before they had been born.\u201d\n\nThere were still concerns, though, and doctors warned that even if Edie was to survive until birth a lack of nutrients could mean that she would suffer growth restriction.\n\nFocused\n\nEmily said: \u201cThey told us that her limbs could be shorter for example, or her eyes smaller.\n\nThey said that her body would be more focused on growing the vital organs, so other parts could be compromised because of it. But all we were concerned with was that she would be born alive and well.\u201d\n\n(Image: Mark Pinder)\n\nThe girls were delivered by Caesarean at 30 weeks \u2013 10 weeks early \u2013 at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.\n\nElsie weighed 3lb 2oz and Edie just 1lb 13oz. Emily, who is currently \u00adstudying for a law degree, said: \u201cThankfully they were born safely, even though Edie was a lot smaller than her sister, at least she was alive.\n\n\u201cWe lay them in their cots side by side and Elsie was almost twice the size of her sister.\n\n\u201cBut they kept snuggling up to each other and loved being so close.\n\n\u201cThe bond between them was still so strong, like it had been in the womb.\n\n\u201cWhen we were finally allowed to bring them home we couldn\u2019t believe that after everything that had happened, we were bringing both of the girls home with us.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing to actually have them here safely with us at last.\u201d\n\nDad Bailey said: \u201cWhen they were first diagnosed with the condition,\n\nit was devastating to hear that they both may not survive.\n\n\u201cBut Emily and I were determined we needed to give them a chance to survive and we are so glad we did. To have them home with us is amazing.\u201d\n\nFertility expert Professor Kingsland said of Edie\u2019s condition: \u201cIt has almost a 100 per cent fatality rate for the baby.\n\n\u201cIt is life-threatening for the mother, too, as it can cause a massive haemorrhage if the umbilical cord breaks away.\n\nIt\u2019s very rare in a singleton pregnancy and incredibly rare for a twin pregnancy to have this condition.\n\n\u201cIn this case, which is remarkable, the smaller twin has had an extra\n\nbit of plumbing, having her twin\u2019s umbilical cord in the right place.\u201d\n\nThe twins are now 17 months old and doing really well.\n\nEmily added: \u201cThey are identical twins, but don\u2019t look exactly the same as their hair is different. Edie is catching up with Elsie, so there isn\u2019t such a big size difference.\n\n\u201cElsie still acts like a bigger sister toher. We are just so glad that we didn\u2019t sacrifice Edie to try and save Elsie \u2013 as it ended up being the other way round. And we have both our daughters with us here now.\n\n\u201cWe feel like the luckiest parents in the world. When our girls are old enough we will tell them how their remarkable journey to survival began when they were still in the womb.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Doctors advise Emily Murphy, 21, to terminate one of their unborn twins after spotting problem - but instead there was a 'remarkable' birth", "authors": ["Lucy Laing", "Image", "Mark Pinder"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565395.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PROD-Miracle-Twins-Emily-Murphy14JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
