All three are Slovakian, from the eastern town of Trebisov, from where most of the women were trafficked.\n\nWagle, who is from Nepal, became involved with the gang initially because he wanted to buy a bride.\n\nVojtech Gombar, one of four people who have been convicted for bringing women from Eastern Europe to Scotland to be exploited (Picture: PA)\n\nAnil Raj Wagle became involved as he wanted a bride (Picture: PA)\n\nProsecutor Kath Harper said: \u2018Vojtech Gombar shows a clear, compelling and powerful pattern of behaviour in recruiting, transporting and exploiting women.\n\n\u2018He exploited them by forcing them into marriage with virtual strangers from which he benefited financially, and/or forcing them into prostitution, from which he and associates benefited.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the victims was forced to have sex with two or three men a day for at least eight months.\n\nMs Harper told the court: \u2018Her autonomy was completely stripped from her and her body became nothing but a vehicle for Gombar and others to make money.\n\n\u2018It is perhaps hard to imagine a more callous and uncaring way to treat another human being.\u2019\n\nJana Sandorova is the step-daughter of Gombar (Picture: PA)\n\nRatislav Adam is one of four people who have been convicted for bringing women from Eastern Europe to Scotland to be exploited (Picture: PA)\n\nPolice said the women were \u2018bought and sold like commodities.\u2019\n\nThey became aware of the trafficking and exploitation in 2014 but it took a three-year operation before around 70 officers raided four flats and made their arrests.\n\nThe gang will be sentenced at a later date.\n\nPolice Scotland Detective Superintendent Fil Capaldi said: \u2018Human trafficking is an insidious crime, often unseen, often unrecognised and has no respect for international borders.\n\n\u2018It has a devastating impact on the victims.\n\n\u2018In this case the crime group exploited vulnerable women using violence, threats and false promises to trade them and advertise in effect human beings to be bought and sold like commodities.\n\n\u2018This was all for the purposes of greed and financial gain without a single thought for the suffering and terror these women had to endure.\u2019\n\nThe Judge, Lord Beckett, remanded all four in custody and praised the Slovakian authorities.\n\nHe said: \u2018Without the invaluable international co-operation, this trial could not have taken place.\n\n\u2018Their efforts have allowed justice to be done in relation to very serious and damaging criminal conduct.\u2019", "description": "A sex-trafficking gang has been convicted of bringing women to the UK from Eastern Europe and forcing them into slavery and prostitution.
