We just live in it. And what the goose wants? The goose gets. As one player recently demonstrated, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\n\nYouTuber TerakJK decided to embark on a quest to collect every item in Untitled Goose Game, and it took seven hours for them to mostly succeed. They dragged all of these items to the goose\u2019s \u201chome\u201d in the game\u2019s starting area and then attempted to cram them into the pit where [ENDGAME SPOILERS REDACTED] happens.\n\nDespite the righteous purity of the goose\u2019s mission, TerakJK did encounter some complications along the way. There\u2019s a pretty enormous number of items in the goose\u2019s town-shaped playground, some which it can easily carry in its mighty, muscular beak and others it has to drag slowly. Townsfolk do not love it when the goose does this and, as people are prone to do with wild geese, give chase.\n\nAs a result, the video was filmed sans two items TerakJK forgot to nab at the time \u2014 the gardener\u2019s hat and the hammer \u2014 and two mugs that the delivery woman in the game\u2019s tavern area broke. Also, they were unable to fit every item in the pit because it\u2019s surrounded by invisible walls.\n\nStill, it\u2019s definitely an accomplishment. We now have no choice but to bow down before the goose, who has all the things, while we have none.", "description": "It\u2019s the goose\u2019s world. We just live in it. And what the goose wants?
