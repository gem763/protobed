He's back, peacocking all over the gaff.\n\nWhy any of the MIC girls want to get with him is a mystery given that all he does is drop into conversation every 12 seconds that he\u2019s been living in South Africa for three months and has therefore lost the ability to communicate with Western Civilisation effectively.\n\nIf you want a good drinking game to play during this episode, take a shot every time he says \u2018it\u2019s so weird being out like this\u2019. One can only presume he spent the three month trip locked away in a game keeper\u2019s abandoned air-raid bunker.\n\nTristan and Miles then discuss the fact that Tristan is sex starved and so would like to date someone. And this person, he says, should \u2018have substance\u2019.\n\nHave you been to South Africa? All Tristan does is drop into conversation every 12 seconds that he\u2019s been living in South Africa for three months and has therefore lost the ability to communicate with Western Civilisation effectively\n\n\u2018Being good looking isn\u2019t enough,\u2019 he says about himself. #braggin'\n\nMiles doesn\u2019t help matters by telling him how good at flirting he is. What IS this mutual fluffing? What happened to friends just being nasty to one another all the time, like in real life?\n\nTo really hammer the aggravating last nail into the insufferable coffin, Tristan reveals that the reason he\u2019s sex starved is because he hasn\u2019t kissed anyone for - wait for it - two and a half MONTHS.\n\nQuick, someone alert the Pope!\n\nZara and Sam really are playing with fire when they discuss the fact that she\u2019s from Essex. If there\u2019s one thing we don\u2019t want it\u2019s a MIC/TOWIE hybrid. If blood starts pouring from your taps, you know it\u2019s finally happened.\n\nGrease is the word! Victoria reveals she had an incident on the plane where a Japanese businessman walked into the toilet to discover her coating her chest with excess serum\n\nZara says Sam is like someone in a band who you let break dance but turn their microphone off because they can\u2019t sing. So, basically, Eyal in Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost, or whatever her X Factor band is called.\n\nSome of the gang are out on the town but Maeva insists she doesn\u2019t care, as James tries to prize her phone out of her hands after she\u2019s been watching Instagram stories on a loop for the past two hours with tear-stained cheeks.\n\nOn said night out, Emily tells Tristan she hates people who plan things; and then asks him to plan something for them to do tomorrow.\n\nThe problem here is that Emily and Verity contribute to Tristan\u2019s formerly-South Africa based ego by fighting over him. Tristan even kisses Verity later in the evening, but is too paralytic to remember doing it.\n\nFOMO? Some of the gang are out on the town but Maeva insists she doesn\u2019t care, as James tries to prize her phone out of her hands after she\u2019s been watching Instagram stories on a loop for the past two hours with tear-stained cheeks\n\nVictoria\u2019s back from launching her pop-up store in Miami and reveals she had an incident on the plane where a Japanese businessman walked into the toilet to discover her coating her chest with excess serum.\n\n\u2018This is why you should always carry a shahtoosh or wear a mask!\u2019 Mark Francis points out.\n\nWhether he is suggesting this for Victoria of the Japanese man isn\u2019t clear.\n\nSam goes to see Jamie despite their bitter feud, because word is getting around that Jamie can\u2019t do Strictly and is depressed about it.\n\nHe suggests Jamie play Cricket 19, which Jamie says he\u2019s coincidentally downloaded \u2013 and then doesn\u2019t ask Sam to stay and play it with him.\n\nBravely: Melissa tells Maeva that she\u2019s English (unlike you Maeva) and doesn\u2019t like upsetting people (unlike you Maeva)\n\nOn his date with Emily (which he hinted would take place in Paris but in actual fact happens in a make-your-own-sushi establishment), Tristan mentions for the 28th time that he\u2019s been in South Africa in the middle of nowhere.\n\nHAVE YOU TRISTAN? HAVE YOU BEEN SETTING UP A SAFARI BUSINESS?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be a crazy turn of events if it transpired Tristan is one of those awful people that shoots giraffes and then poses with the corpse next to an old Jeep?\n\nMelissa doesn\u2019t want to go to dinner with Maeva and James and has to figure out a way of telling Maeva this without being nasty.\n\nThere is none.\n\nAmuse-bouche? Sophie \u2013 fantastically \u2013 isn\u2019t impressed with Tristan's alleged trans-continental savoir-faire. \u2018Is he back from ze bush?\u2019 she asks\n\nBravely, she tells Maeva that she\u2019s English (unlike you Maeva) and doesn\u2019t like upsetting people (unlike you Maeva).\n\nThis is all because Maeva was a bit nasty to Verit - but by the way Verity is swanning about in the preview for next week it looks like she had it coming.\n\nThe fact that Tristan spent three months in South Aftica is so ingrained into everyone\u2019s brains that it\u2019s even being talked about when he\u2019s not there.\n\nSophie \u2013 fantastically \u2013 isn\u2019t impressed with his alleged trans-continental savoir-faire. \u2018Is he back from ze bush?\u2019 she asks. Her response to Tristan taking Emily to that sushi place is simply: \u2018Ew\u2026 street sushi?\u2019\n\nAwks? Sam, Jamie, Zara and Habbs have an awkward double-date in which they discuss the moistness of Jamie\u2019s hands and how big the olives are\n\nWhen told it\u2019s okay because this place was in Mayfair, Sophie exclaims \u2018Thank God\u2019 before popping off to cleanse herself with some Angelica root.\n\nVerity targets Emily and asks her about the fact that they\u2019re both dating Tristan.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a competition!\u2019 Emily points out.\n\n\u2018I know!\u2019 Verity snaps back, adding, \u2018but it seems like you think it is,\u2019 consequently competing with her over how much each of them thinks it\u2019s a competition.\n\nPlay nice? It\u2019s very awkward but it seems Jamie and Sam are back on track which is nice but also makes for less enthralling TV\n\nVerity then flounces off to find Tristan where they laugh about how she woke up the other day and found his name tag in her bag.\n\nPresumably they ended their night at a PTA meeting\u2026\n\nSam, Jamie, Zara and Habbs have an awkward double-date in which they discuss the moistness of Jamie\u2019s hands and how big the olives are.\n\nIt\u2019s very awkward but it seems Jamie and Sam are back on track which is nice but also makes for less enthralling TV.", "description": "After Liv's gallery event, there was evidently a raucous party which involved people taking all of their clothing off and running riot.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/19/20293370-0-image-a-93_1572289322111.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
