Our hypocrisy over racism has reached ridiculous levels.", "description": "The two former managers were speaking on Sky Sports after Liverpool's 1-1 draw with Manchester United", "authors": ["Stan Collymore", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660149.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DMP_CHP__21764PunditsJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
