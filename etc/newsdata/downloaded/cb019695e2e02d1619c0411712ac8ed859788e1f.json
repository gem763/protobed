Circadian rhythms are around 24-hours in length. They vary from person to person - which is why some people are 'morning people' and others are 'night owls'. Natural factors within the body produce circadian rhythms as well as environmental signals such as daylight. Irregular rhythms have been linked to various chronic health conditions, such as sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes and depression. Exposure to light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms and helps with sleep. Melatonin levels rise in the evening and stay elevated throughout the night, promoting sleep. Artificial lighting and electronics with blue wavelengths trick the mind into thinking it's daytime. How can you reduce your exposure? Use dim red lights, which have the least effect on melatonin, for night lights.\n\nAvoid looking at bright screens beginning two to three hours before bed.\n\nIf you work a night shift or use a lot of electronic devices at night, there are glasses and apps that can filter the blue light.\n\nCheck if your phone settings have a night time setting which automatically shifts the display screen to warmer colours at sunset time.\n\nFurthermore, very heavy users were 36 per cent more likely to wake up throughout the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. The risk for high users was eight per cent greater than average users.\n\nLow users were the least likely to fall asleep late - suggesting minimal social media use produces 'optimal outcomes for sleep', the researchers said.\n\nThe findings are particular concern on school days, as late bedtimes can 'predict poorer academic and emotional outcomes,' the authors wrote.\n\nSleep deprivation has been linked to worse academic performance because it slows memory and impairs learning.\n\nDr Max Davie, officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: 'It\u2019s vital for their mental and physical health that children and young people get enough good quality sleep.\n\n'Screen use isn\u2019t in itself harmful, so long as it doesn\u2019t dictate family life and prevent young people spending time on other fulfilling activities.'\n\nBut James Wilson, a sleep practitioner and owner of the Sleep Lab, who was not involved in the latest research, said the findings were not concerning.\n\nHe said: 'As they go through their teenage years they (children) will be more inclined to go to bed later and get up later.\n\n'It is one study and from my work with teens, the early start times of most schools has a far bigger impact on teenagers sleep than social media use.'\n\nHowever, he added that social media use can raise heart rate - by getting angry at a friend's post - and make it harder to get to sleep.\n\n'Our bodies remain alert and this stops the body going through the right process to fall asleep and stay asleep,' he said.\n\nThe results of the study, which is observational and can't prove cause, could reflect underlying health issues, the researchers suggested.\n\nTeenagers with poorer wellbeing may spend more time on social media and also experience sleep problems.\n\nNevertheless, the researchers said their study provides 'robust evidence' because it is on a large group of people.\n\nDr Bernadka Dubicka, chairwoman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: 'Lack of sleep can be hugely damaging, and is often related to poor mental health and academic achievement.\n\n'Children and young people should also avoid using screens in the last hour before bed as this will help them sleep better at night.'\n\nGirls tended to spend more time on social media than boys and reported poorer sleep quality, the findings showed.\n\nMore than 28 per cent of the girls spent at least five hours on social media a day, compared with 14 per cent of boys.\n\nScientists have suggested blue light emitted by screens, such as mobile phones and tablets, affect the body clock and hormones that help us to sleep.\n\nIn January, MPs on the Commons science and technology committee said social media led to damaged sleep patterns.\n\nAnd in February, the UK\u2019s leading doctors said parents should not allow children to take electronic devices into their bedrooms.", "description": "Teenagers' social media use and sleeping patterns were analysed by University of Glasgow.
