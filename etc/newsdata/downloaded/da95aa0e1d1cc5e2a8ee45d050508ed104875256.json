And Danielle Paquette takes us on a ride with an African delivery service.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nBoris Johnson is steering toward a no-deal Brexit. Parliament is trying to stop him.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has faced several defeats this week. After losing a governing majority in Parliament, he saw his own brother resign from Parliament and watched a bill that would bar a no-deal Brexit without lawmakers\u2019 approval to find support in the House of Commons.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson is now pressing for an early general election for all 650 seats in the House of Commons, with the hope of delivering Brexit by Oct. 31.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is a bit of a muddle,\u201d says London correspondent Kevin Sullivan . \u201cEveryone is looking for some clarity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018You want to have some kind of control\u2019\n\nPlanned Parenthood ended its participation in a federal family planning program last month. The organization\u2019s announcement came after a prolonged legal battle with the Trump administration, which introduced prohibitions on abortion referrals into the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Maine Family Planning \u2014 an independent network of 18 reproductive health clinics providing birth control, primary care, STD screenings and abortion to women across mostly rural parts of the state \u2014 followed suit in withdrawing from Title X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat Planned Parenthood has that a lot of these smaller, independent clinics don\u2019t have is this massive war chest of funding,\u201d says The Lily reporter Caroline Kitchener . \u201cIt\u2019s just so much more visible, even to people in a state where 18 of the 20 clinics are not Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nClinics in rural areas are the most likely to close if their funding dries up. But the practitioners Kitchener spoke with say that those are the most essential to keep open.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growing e-commerce sector in Africa\n\nBy some estimates, the number of Internet users in Africa is greater than the population of the United States. But reaching that exploding market is a major challenge on the continent, where business leaders are working on leaping into the complicated world of same-day delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Africa bureau chief Danielle Paquette road with a delivery person who works for Africa\u2019s biggest web retailer, Jumia. Along her route, she navigated a lack of street signs, dominance of cash, threat of robbery and fear of knockoffs to get packages out as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe wants to create a career in the world of online shopping,\u201d Paquette says of the deliverywoman. \u201cShe told me she thinks it\u2019s the future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Kevin Sullivan breaks down Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit battle.
