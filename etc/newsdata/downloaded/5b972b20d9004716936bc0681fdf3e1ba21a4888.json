A US Diplomat's wife, Anne Sacoolas, is accused\n\nParents who need to feel the death of their son was not merely a minor inconvenience, worth so little that his loss could simply be dismissed.\n\nAs Harry\u2019s mother, Charlotte, put it: \u2018It is not much to ask.\u2019 There cannot be a single person in Britain who doesn\u2019t agree with her. But it doesn\u2019t seem anyone is listening.\n\nNot that, for all the fuss about to-ing and fro-ing between embassies, this is really about diplomacy. It\u2019s just about right and wrong.\n\nMrs Sacoolas still has a chance to put things right. But she needs to get a move on. Because if she doesn\u2019t make the decision to return and face justice soon \u2014 and I mean now \u2014 what might have been a tragic accident, one of those terrible things that sometimes happens, will become a full-blown moral crime, compounded by cowardice and callousness.\n\nAnne Sacoolas, wife of US diplomat Jonathan Sacoolas, who was based at RAF Croughton\n\nI know she must be scared. Scared that if she is found guilty of a criminal offence and jailed, her children will be deprived of their mother \u2014 if only for a time.\n\nBut, however bad it might be, it won\u2019t ever be as bad as what Harry\u2019s parents will be going through for the rest of their lives.\n\nHow will Mrs Sacoolas live with herself, tucking her kids in at night, or dropping them off at school in a leafy American suburb, knowing her actions may have deprived another mother of her son? What kind of freedom is that?\n\nFor any normal person, the guilt would be too much to bear. It would gnaw away at them over the years, the spectre of that young boy on his motorbike forever hovering over them.\n\nRunning away won\u2019t banish it. It will simply make it a thousand times stronger.\n\nMrs Sacoolas doesn\u2019t just owe it to Harry\u2019s family to do the right thing; she owes it to her own. She needs to set an example to her children: if you make a mistake, face up to it. She needs to be a person of whom they can be proud \u2014 not someone to be ashamed of.\n\nIt is the best chance she has of redemption, and the best chance of being fairly judged if it comes to court. But most of all, it is the very least she can do for the memory of young Harry Dunn.\n\nJennifer Arcuri says she saved Boris Johnson\u2019s phone number under the code name \u2018Alexander the Great\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting detail that probably tells us more about their relationship than any amount of media questioning.\n\nI have a famous politician stored in my phone under \u2018Gandalf\u2019. Bet you can\u2019t guess who it is.\n\nI was struck by the footage of this Extinction Rebellion protester clutching a photograph of his two children while weeping uncontrollably.\n\n'I\u2019m just a father of two children who\u2019s very frightened of their future,\u2019 he sobbed.\n\nPart of me felt sorry for him \u2014 he\u2019s clearly got issues. But, for goodness\u2019 sake, man, you\u2019re not living in war-torn Yemen. Your children will be fine.\n\nNow get a grip!\n\nPart of me felt sorry for the Extinction Rebellion protester (pictured) \u2014 he\u2019s clearly got issues. But, for goodness\u2019 sake, man, you\u2019re not living in war-torn Yemen. Your children will be fine\n\nWill no one take the blame?\n\nEvery time I see that footage of Lord Brittan walking shakily towards his car, television cameras in his face, at the height of the Operation Midland \u2018Nick\u2019 hysteria, my heart breaks for him.\n\nImagine being falsely accused of crimes so foul as rape, paedophilia and sadistic abuse \u2014 and then dying in the knowledge the whole world thought you were guilty.\n\nHow is it possible not a single person is to be held accountable for this monstrous witch-hunt \u2014 not Cressida Dick; not Labour\u2019s Deputy Leader Tom Watson, who fanned the flames of hysteria; not any of the officers involved?\n\nSomeone must accept responsibility \u2014 otherwise, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens again.\n\nFeminists have for years been calling for James Bond to be killed off \u2014 now, it seems, they have succeeded, or at least managed to neuter the old rogue.\n\nAccording to Naomie Harris, who plays Eve Moneypenny in the new 007 movie, we\u2019ll be seeing a Bond \u2018who\u2019s more in touch with his feelings\u2019.\n\nA woke Bond? About as useful as a chocolate teapot . . .\n\nPrue Leith says being a judge on The Great British Bake Off while she was wheelchair-bound following an injury has made her a stone overweight.\n\nShe looks fine to me \u2014 but I\u2019ve never met a woman who doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s a stone overweight.\n\nAnd, annoyingly, it\u2019s often the ones who worry the most who have the least to fear. Stollen castle, anyone?\n\nPrue Leith (pictured on September 20) says being a judge on The Great British Bake Off while she was wheelchair-bound following an injury has made her a stone overweight\n\nA very odd break-up\n\nDon\u2019t you just love the notion that, when spotted in Central Park with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2010, Prince Andrew was simply there to \u2018break off\u2019 their friendship?\n\n\u2018He went to see a friend to tell them he couldn\u2019t be their friend any more,\u2019 says \u2018a source\u2019.\n\nHmm. My experience of the upper classes is that when they decide they don\u2019t like you any more, they just blank you.\n\nAndrew, by contrast, stayed with Epstein in his house and attended a dinner there. It\u2019s a very odd way of ending any kind of relationship, especially one as tenuous as he would have us believe this was.\n\nI love the idea that actress Helena Bonham Carter consults a psychic every time she takes on a deceased character (her latest is Princess Margaret in The Crown).\n\nIt\u2019s deliciously bonkers, but so brilliantly her.\n\nHelena is a true English eccentric, a dying breed in this age of tremulous, conformist celebrities who haven\u2019t a single original thought in their heads.\n\nPoor Anneka ended up looking a right lemon\n\nIt was clear from the start that Anneka Rice was never going to get very far on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nBut if they hadn\u2019t put her in that hideous yellow tracksuit and made her dance to that ghastly tune, she might have had a better chance of survival.\n\nBut perhaps that was the intention all along . . .", "description": "SARAH VINE: I am prepared to concede Anne Sacoolas, the American diplomat's wife accused of killing British teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn, might have made an error of judgment.", "authors": ["Sarah Vine For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/00/19467386-0-image-a-11_1570577045158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
