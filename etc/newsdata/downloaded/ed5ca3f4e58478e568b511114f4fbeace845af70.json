Mackenzie Dern at UFC on ESPN+ 19: Best photos view 14 images\n\nMackenzie Dern got most of the hype going into her strawweight main-card bout against Amanda Ribas on Saturday night, and for good reason: She was undefeated, and she was returning after taking more than a year off due to pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nBut when the cage door shut for the fight at UFC on ESPN+ 19, it was all Ribas\u2019 night. Ribas (8-1 MMA, 2-0 UFC) looked sharp throughout , while Dern (7-1 MMA, 2-1 UFC) looked like a competitor dealing with ring rust, and that played out in a unanimous-decision victory for Ribas.\n\nThe judges\u2019 scores at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. were 30-27 across the board in favor of Ribas.\n\nRibas set the tone early on by landing solid counters. Once they started finding a home, she began pushing the pace, moving forward, and landing stiff jabs and overhands. Dern attempted a takedown late in order to implement her superior jiu-jitsu game, but Ribas shifted her weight, turned it into a throw, and got into top position as the round wound down.\n\nThe second round was a carbon copy of the first, right down the late ground exchange. In the third, Ribas was mostly content to use her reach advantage to stick and move, although she picked up the pace with a final big flurry as the horn sounded.\n\nWith her second career decision victory, Ribas has now won three in a row.\n\nUp-to-the-minute UFC on ESPN+ 19 results include:", "description": "Amanda Ribas defeated Mackenzie Dern at UFC Tampa.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/amanda-ribas-mackenzie-dern-ufc-on-espn-plus-19-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
