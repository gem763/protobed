I was speaking to her two hours earlier. And she was perfectly fine. I was just in shock.\n\n\"My daughter started to ask questions like \"where's mummy?\" and stuff like that. By the end of it I just couldn't live with the guilt of not telling her what was going on.\n\n\"I took her to a quiet area and told her, and my mum helped me with that, and just explained it to her the best I could in her language. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.\"\n\n(Image: GoFundMe)\n\nHe took Macy to see her mum, one last time in hospital before the machine was turned off, so the little girl could say goodbye.\n\nMs Phillips was able to donate some of her organs, and Mr Denney had urged others to seek help if they are struggling.\n\nA GoFundMe page has also been set up to support the family.\n\nIf you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org", "description": "Little Macy's mum Beajay was put on life support after she tried to take her own life and died eight days later in hospital", "authors": ["Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Gofundme"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20600167.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Wheres-mummy-Devastated-father-opens-up-about-the-moment-he-had-to-tell-their-daughter-3-she-h.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
