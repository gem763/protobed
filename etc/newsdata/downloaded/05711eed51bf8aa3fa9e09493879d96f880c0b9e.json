From today we are all more free, even those who disagree. It is a victory of civil disobedience, while the (political) parties turned their heads away\u201d.\n\nThe Italian Episcopal Conference expressed its \u201cdiscontent and distance\u201d from the court\u2019s decision, quoting Pope Francis who on Friday spoke out against assisted suicide and euthanasia.\n\n\u201cWe can and we must reject the temptation, which is also favoured by legislative changes, to use medicine to satisfy a sick person\u2019s possible wish to die,\u201d the pope said.\n\nThe Italian bishops asked for lawmakers to \u201crecognise these values\u201d when debating the matter.\n\nBeppino Englaro, who was involved in a 2008 court battle to end the life of his daughter Eluana due to her being in a vegetative state, hailed Cappato as \u201ca pioneer who opened the way to establishing a right\u201d.\n\nThe court said that a patient\u2019s condition must be \u201ccausing physical and psychological suffering that he or she considers intolerable\u201d. Following approval of the decision by a local ethical committee, public health authorities should verify all conditions are met.\n\nThe head of the powerful Catholic Doctors Association (AMCI), Filippo Boscia, announced the \u201cconscientious objection\u201d of its members and slammed \u201ca slide towards euthanasia and a violation of our professional code\u201d.\n\nItaly\u2019s Coscioni Association said that more than 800 Italians had said on their \u201cSOS Euthanasia\u201d website that they would like to die through assisted suicide.\n\nFar-right leader Matteo Salvini, who strives to appeal to Catholic voters and frequently kisses his rosary at rallies, said he was \u201copposed to state-sponsored suicide imposed by the law\u201d.\n\nLeftwing MP Nicola Fratoianni tweeted: \u201cAfter the ruling, there are no more alibis: parliament should be capable of making a law of freedom for those who ask for self-determination and dignity for their lives.\u201d\n\nThe court had since Tuesday been re-examining the question of legalising assisted suicide after it gave parliament last October a one-year deadline to fill a legal void on the thorny issue, but MPs have not done so.\n\n\u201cThe current legal framework concerning the end of life deprives specific situations \u2026 of adequate protection,\u201d the court wrote last year.\n\nCappato turned himself in to Italian authorities after his \u201cact of civil disobedience\u201d to highlight what he saw as an unjust law.\n\nHe pointed out that assisted suicide was reserved for those with the physical and financial means to travel to Switzerland, where it is legal.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a cage. I would like to choose to die without suffering,\u201d Antoniani wrote to the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, before his death in Switzerland.\n\nA Milan court is trying Cappato on the charge of \u201cinstigating or assisting suicide\u201d, but asked the constitutional court to clarify the current law. He is likely to be acquitted following the constitutional court\u2019s decision.", "description": "Assisting%20a%20suicide%20is%20not%20always%20a%20crime%2C%20rules%20Italian%20court%20%7C%20Assisted%20dying%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
