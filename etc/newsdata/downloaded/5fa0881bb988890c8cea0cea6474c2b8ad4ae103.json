(AP) - The Auburn Tigers only have to look back to avoid looking ahead.\n\nThe seventh-ranked Tigers host a Mississippi State team Saturday night that \u201cembarrassed\u201d them last season. That memory is presumably enough to keep Auburn (4-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) from peeking past this game toward a visit to No. 9 Florida.\n\n\u201cThey definitely embarrassed us last year,\u201d Tigers defensive tackle Derrick Brown said. \u201cWe let the quarterback run for a bunch of yards. That was the highest rushing total we gave up all year. On defense, look at their rushing statistics and stuff like that - that\u2019s a lot of yards to give up in a game. That really was an embarrassment.\u201d\n\nA quick recap: The Bulldogs (3-1, 1-0) beat Auburn 23-9 while piling up 349 rushing yards and holding Auburn to 90 yards on the ground.\n\nNow, the Tigers have emerged as the league\u2019s top rushing team and a potential contender in a Western Division that also includes No. 4 LSU and No. 2 Alabama.\n\nMississippi State might need another physically dominant performance to repeat last season\u2019s outcome.\n\nQuarterback Nick Fitzgerald carried 28 times for 195 yards and Kylin Hill gained 126 yards on 23 runs. Fitzgerald is now gone but Hill is the SEC\u2019s leading rusher .\n\nBulldogs coach Joe Moorhead said he is \u201cjust as nervous going into this one as I was last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to be able to do some things to keep them off balanced with maybe a little more misdirection than we have normally done,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cYou are not just going to line up and run the ball downhill at these guys. It doesn\u2019t work that way. We are going to have to find creative ways to create space and angles.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know about the Mississippi State-Auburn game:\n\nQB QUESTION\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who will start at quarterback for the Bulldogs. Starter Tommy Stevens missed the Kentucky game while nursing a shoulder injury on his throwing arm, but was throwing in practice early this week, Moorhead said. Garrett Shrader was named the SEC freshman of the week after passing for 180 yards and rushing for another 125 in his starting debut.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to run the quarterback a little bit, regardless, whichever quarterback\u2019s there,\u201d Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting to possibly see both, but there are some similarities. They\u2019re going to run their quarterback.\u201d\n\nMississippi State and Ohio State are the only Power 5 teams to rush for 200-plus yards four times already.\n\nCONTAINING HILL\n\nHill has already run 91 times for 551 yards and five touchdowns. He\u2019s facing a stout run defense led by Brown & Co. on the front line. The Tigers have held three of their first four opponents below 100 rushing yards.\n\nPROTECTING NIX\n\nAuburn can expect most teams to try to apply some pressure to freshman quarterback Bo Nix, and Malzahn describes the Bulldogs as \u201ca very aggressive team.\u201d Mississippi State safety Brian Cole Jr. leads the SEC with 5.5 tackles for loss and the team with a pair of sacks.\n\nTURNOVER BATTLE\n\nThe Bulldogs have forced a league-best 11 turnovers and trail only Alabama in turnover margin. Auburn hasn\u2019t been so good in that regard, tying for 12th with Texas A&M.; The Tigers have only forced three turnovers, though Nix hasn\u2019t thrown an interception since getting picked off twice in the opener against Oregon.\n\nBEATING TOP 10\n\nMississippi State is seeking its first road win over a top 10 team since beating then-No. 8 LSU 34-29 in 2014. That\u2019s the season the Bulldogs beat No. 2 Auburn 38-23 to rise to their first No. 1 ranking.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Auburn Tigers only have to look back to avoid looking ahead.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Zenor"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/kentucky_mississippi_st_football_44286_c0-206-4921-3075_s1770x1032.jpg?e2b56d88622cbb994a2b2cedc0bbc9af5218c8f6", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
