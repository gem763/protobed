In December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to charges that he lied to the FBI about his Russia contacts during his brief stint as national-security adviser. He is expected to be sentenced in December.\n\n\u201cThose changes added an unequivocal statement that \u2018Flynn stated he did not\u2019 \u2014 in response to whether Mr. Flynn had asked Kislyak to vote in a certain manner or slow down the UN vote [on sanctions],\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cThis is a deceptive manipulation because, as the notes of the agents show, Mr. Flynn was not even sure he had spoken to Russia/Kislyak on the issue. He had talked to dozens of countries.\u201d\n\nRelated Video: Justice Dept.
