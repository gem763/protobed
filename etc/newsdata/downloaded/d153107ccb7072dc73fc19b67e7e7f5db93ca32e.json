While she found Westpac failed in its duty to provide financial services \u2018\u2018efficiently, honestly and fairly\u2019\u2019, she said Westpac\u2019s campaign did not stray into the category of personal advice.\n\nBut the appeal judges ruled Westpac\u2019s campaign should have taken into account customers\u2019 personal circumstances and so did constitute personal advice.\n\nThe judges cited a few key problems with the Westpac campaign.\n\nAllsop wrote in his judgment that the Westpac push to \u2018\u2018close\u2019\u2019 the transaction on the phone and get the customer to consolidate their accounts with BT involved an implied recommendation.\n\nJagot called the whole campaign an example of a \u2018\u2018systemic sharp practice\u2019\u2019, and said the pre-existing relationship between Westpac and the customers meant Westpac would be expected to consider their best interests.\n\nWestpac is disappointed with the decision and is considering an appeal to the High Court. That would be a big step given this is a unanimous judgment.\n\nBut for the wider financial advice industry, this case is important in clarifying just how limited general advice is.\n\nHerbert Smith Freehills partner Michael Vrisakis describes it as a \u2018\u2018double whammy for providers of general advice\u2019\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if a product is only recommended through implication, if a customer reasonably believes the institution is looking after their interests, then this judgment says the institution may well have strayed into personal advice.\n\nAnd if it hasn\u2019t strayed, if the advice relates to a matter of significant financial importance \u2013 super is a great example \u2013 then you may be found to have not acted efficiently, honestly and fairly, in accordance with the community expectations.\n\n''The more interaction and dialogue you have had or have with the client, the greater the risk,\u2019\u2019 Vrisakis says.\n\nHe expects the judgment will reinforce the view for financial providers that they are on safer ground if they shift away from general advice towards the higher standard of personal advice.\n\nYes, the advice will be more tailored. But this will be much more expensive because it requires the provider to understand the customer\u2019s individual circumstances, ramp up disclosure (typically through a statement of advice) and meet a higher standard of consumer protections.\n\nASIC is pleased that general advice will be much more narrowly defined \u2013 it\u2019s sceptical of how general advice has been used to sell a product (as, it argues, in the Westpac case), and says consumers struggle to tell general and personal advice apart anyway, leading to potential problems.\n\nBut what\u2019s the outcome for consumers here?\n\nNo one wants consumers exposed to \u2018\u2018sharp practices\u2019\u2019 by institutions. But if general advice is limited to informational, educational material \u2013 the sort stuff that ASIC arguably does best itself through its MoneySmart website, but this can be hard for consumers to engage with \u2013 should we then be concerned that we are reliant on forms of personal advice that is unaffordable for some, or even many, Australians?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy making the distinction between general and personal advice much more black and white, will a lot of consumers get left in the grey?", "description": "ASIC's Federal Court win over Westpac on financial advice has big ramifications for the sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2965%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_41/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/de5332e537a037aae346539210b345ac9178370a", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
