From his recent doctored hurricane map to the infamous marker-written notes for the Canadian prime minister, he has mastered the art of creating crises with a stroke of a pen.\n\nBut he\u2019s not the first world leader to do so. A closer look at history reveals that Trump is only the latest in a long line of strong-man leaders to scrawl their way into a bind.\n\nWho can forget Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Trump\u2019s closest foreign allies, deploying an unnervingly thick red marker pen at the United Nations in 2012 to demonstrate the danger of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Here in the Middle East, people are very familiar with the damage a quickly scrawled line can do. It was this region that perhaps suffered the biggest calamity to result from a scribbled line \u2013 this time with a pencil.\n\nThe Sykes-Picot agreement, a secret treaty between two colonial leaders which demarcated the new borders of the Middle East, contributed to more than 100 years of conflict and instability.\n\nWhat does all of this tell us? We spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about what an unstable or authoritarian leader will do with their finger on the button, but less about what they will do with a pen in their hand.\n\nYours,\n\nRichard Hall\n\nMiddle East correspondent", "description": "In the few years since he became president, Donald Trump has turned his beloved Sharpie collection into a potent political weapon.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/18/trumpmap-sharpie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
