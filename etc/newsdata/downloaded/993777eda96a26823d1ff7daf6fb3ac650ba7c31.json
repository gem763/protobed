The white metal tends to be less prone to a sell-off when stocks rise than gold is, given that as well as a precious metal it has many industrial uses. At the same time, the fact that it is still viewed as a safe-haven metal means it could go up along with gold in the event of a risk-off period in the stock markets.\n\nBut more to the point, there are at least four reasons why we are turning bullish on silver. Let\u2019s go through each in turn:\n\nWith the falling for three consecutive weeks, thanks mainly to the euro and pound rallying on Brexit optimism, the dollar-denominated precious metal could rise further \u2013 especially if the dollar\u2019s weakness is accompanied by a sell-off in stock markets. Meanwhile, judging by the rally in equity markets and the recent rebound in commodity dollars and , investors are apparently becoming more confident that the US and China will soon be able to strike a trade deal after agreeing to a partial arrangement the week before. If so, demand for silver in its physical form should, in theory, rise as manufacturing activity rebounds. The ratio has continued to trend lower after topping out last year near historic highs around 93.35. At 84.10ish, the ratio is now back below the high from last year (at 86.54), thus suggesting this year\u2019s earlier breakout attempt was a false move. In other words, silver is outperforming gold at the moment which makes it a better long candidate or a worse short candidate over gold. In addition, and more significantly, this morning saw silver poke above its consolidative trend line plotted from connecting the recent lower highs. If the breakout is sustained and we close above resistance and last year\u2019s high at $17.70, then this could lead to further technical buying in the days ahead.\n\nSo, the potential is there for silver to rally over the coming days. But first thing is first, it needs to hold today\u2019s breakout attempt above its trend.\n\nSilver Daily Chart\n\nDisclaimer: The information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.
