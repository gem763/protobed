This is plenty of time to ratify our deal\u201d.\n\nburs-ar/phz/ecl/aph", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 The British Prime Minister is expected to make a fresh attempt Tuesday to force an early election, despite MPs rejecting his plan,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/71ce40_johnson-suffered-major-setback-he-was-forced-agree-delay-britain-departure-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
