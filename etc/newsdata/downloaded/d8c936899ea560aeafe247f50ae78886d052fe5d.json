Then Johansson debuts Netflix\u2019s \u201cMarriage Story\u201d (in theaters Nov. 6 in New York and Los Angeles, streaming Dec. 6) in which she plays Nicole, a once-famous actress rediscovering herself as she divorces her husband (Adam Driver), a decorated New York theater director.\n\nAs Johansson, 34, approached the dual roles, limbo became new, too: She was mid-divorce with her second husband, French journalist Romain Dauriac, with whom she shares a 5-year-old daughter, Rose.\n\nScarlett Johansson jokes: Keeping 'Black Widow' a secret was like 'having an affair'\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve felt in the past \u2013 there\u2019s such a loneliness to being a single parent,\u201d says Johansson, whose vibe is frank (and admittedly a bit jet-lagged) today and dressed movie-star casual: jeans, a tomato-red ribbed Alexander Wang top and black stilettos. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a lot of many different things at once, but there can be a loneliness and this constant feeling of doubt, that you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re doing and you don\u2019t have anyone else to bounce it off of.\u201d\n\nScarlett Johansson, who plays single mothers in \"Jojo Rabbit\" and \"Marriage Story,\" opens up about single parenthood. \"There can be a loneliness and this constant feeling of doubt, that you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re doing and you don\u2019t have anyone else to bounce it off of.\u201d (Photo: HARRISON HILL/USA TODAY)\n\nToronto Film Festival: Taika Waititi calls 'Jojo Rabbit' a 'love letter to mothers'\n\nParenting solo brings a specific kind of isolation, she notes. \u201cYou\u2019re also spending a lot of time alone with a child, without the company of another adult, which is hard for long periods of time. You maybe have doubts about your life: How did I get here? It\u2019s not all the time \u2026 but those moments creep in, and they creep in at weird times.\u201d\n\nToday, of course, Johansson is engaged to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d head writer Colin Jost, 37; her egg-shaped engagement ring catches morning sunlight from her left hand as she speaks. But few knew her marriage to Dauriac was crumbling when Noah Baumbach, who wrote and directs \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d pitched her his semi-autobiographical divorce tale over lunch. Especially not Baumbach.\n\nScarlett Johansson plays a German mother worried over her son's adoration of Hitler in the WWII satire \"Jojo Rabbit.\" (Photo: LARRY HORRICKS/FOX SEARCHLIGHT VIA AP)\n\nShe was late that day and apologized, saying she was going through a divorce. \" 'You'll either love this or hate this,' I remember myself saying, or maybe just thinking,\" Baumbach recalled Monday night at the Elle Women in Hollywood Celebration, where he toasted Johansson. But she was in. \u201cThe thing about Scarlett is her personal situation wasn\u2019t a reason not to do it, it was a reason to do it.\u201d\n\nBy the time she filmed \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d which sees Nicole lean into the advice of her power divorce attorney (Laura Dern), Johansson found herself \u201cin a much more settled place ... I wasn\u2019t in it, which was a better place to be professionally. I\u2019d processed my feelings about it so I could use them instead of being in a cloud about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nWhere \u201cMarriage Story\u201d is a palpable journey of love lost, \u201cJojo\u201d is a roller coaster packed with audacious satire and emotional wallops, as Rosie, who is secretly hiding a Jewish teenager in the attic, employs her devious sense of mischief to try to keep from losing her son to malevolent forces.\n\n\u201cI already knew that she was funny, like outside of what you would see in a Marvel film or most movies,\u201d says Waititi, describing Johansson as \u201cgoofy\u201d offscreen. But he says she's \u201calso very protective. She likes to look after people. She\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re OK, she\u2019s got this maternal instinct, that\u2019s who she is.\u201d\n\nThe two films are now earning best actress and supporting actress talk for Johansson, who has spent the majority of the last decade as a founding Avenger in the Marvel blockbusters (her standalone \"Black Widow\" movie arrives May 1). And both, notably, close with a sense of hope.\n\nWhen did Johansson begin to feel hopeful for her own next chapter?\n\n\u201cWhen you have a breakup of any kind, whether it\u2019s amicable or not, you question a lot of the choices that you\u2019ve made. ... OK, who am I now? And I had this new identity as a single mom, so what is that? How does this work? Even the logistics of it, and the emotional cadence of it. How is this going to be? And not knowing what the future holds. These are all things that trigger my anxiety,\u201d she chuckles.\n\nBut therapy, she says, and working on projects like \u201cJojo\u201d and \u201cMarriage Story\" helped build her back up.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have a breakdown like either of these characters do \u2013 I still have them \u2013 but I really credit also having my daughter there,\" she says. \"When I look at her, I feel full of hope and positivity. It\u2019s good to wallow for a little bit. And then you have to pull yourself up.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/16/scarlett-johansson-talks-single-parenthood-divorce-jojo-rabbit-marriage-story/3988273002/", "description": "As Scarlett Johansson prepared for \"Jojo Rabbit\" and Netflix's \"Marriage Story,\" she was mid-divorce.
