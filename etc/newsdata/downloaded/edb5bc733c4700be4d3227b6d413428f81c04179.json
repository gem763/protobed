McInally is still working on it.\n\nOn Sunday, Scotland was in Ireland\u2019s dust within six minutes of their tournament opener, and trailed by a game-over 19-3 after 27 minutes. Ireland went on to win 27-3 in Yokohama.\n\nConceding early is an old habit of Scotland\u2018s, but it seems to have only worsened. In nine games this year, the Scots have conceded tries within the first 15 minutes.\n\nIreland, France, Wales, and England all struck early in the Six Nations - England even managed three tries in the first 12 minutes. France did it twice more in the World Cup warmups last month.\n\n\u201cWe are aware we are starting games poorly,\u201d McInally said on Monday. \u201cIt is being addressed, to make sure we are the ones applying pressure.\n\n\u201cIf you start a game well, it is a massive boost for you. They started well yesterday and they were always in the ascendancy. I don\u2019t have the answer for you today why we don\u2019t start well, and how we are going to start better. But we are addressing it and we will have a plan in place going into the rest of these games to make sure we start better.\u201d\n\nAssistant coach Danny Wilson said it was also on the staff to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWe as a coaching team need to find a way of consistently producing the kind of quality rugby we need to produce to win games, and if we\u2019re being brutally honest about it, we\u2019ve got to eradicate some of the errors we make and the pressure we heap on ourselves.\n\n\u201cWe need these big test matches against top opposition to be tight right at the end of the game, and perhaps too often we\u2019ve ended up too many points behind to do that. We\u2019ve got to chance our arm as opposed to staying in the arm wrestle.\u201d\n\nMcInally said they thought they prepared well for the pool match, and didn\u2019t expect not to fire a shot.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, it is tough. We invested a lot of time into that Ireland game; that goes for everyone involved in the group. Then to perform so poorly is really disheartening,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone is gutted, but the tournament was never going to be won and lost yesterday.\u201d\n\nHe added criticism of them was justified, though it was not as harsh as their own thoughts.\n\n\u201cBased on the way we played yesterday, I don\u2019t think we are not due any criticism. It\u2019s a professional sport. We are expected to play well and we didn\u2019t play well,\u201d McInally said.\n\n\u201cWe criticize ourselves really heavily as well, and that criticism comes from within, from what the coaches say about our performances and what we demand from each other. We are hard on each other, and we are desperate to do well in this tournament.\u201d\n\nScotland next face Samoa next Monday in Kobe, followed by Russia and Japan.\n\nScotland has reached one semifinal and six quarterfinals in eight World Cups.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Captain Stuart McInally promised Scotland will start better in the rest of its Rugby World Cup games after Ireland was the latest to embarrass them early.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
