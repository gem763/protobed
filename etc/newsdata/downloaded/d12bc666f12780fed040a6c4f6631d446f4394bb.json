The White House counsel Pat Cipollone fired off a letter to Democrats this week stating that no one from the Trump administration would testify or participate in what he called Democrats\u2019 \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional\u201d impeachment probe.\n\nKurt Volker Kurt VolkerGOP seeks to gain more control of impeachment narrative Making sense of the key players in the Trump-Ukraine controversy House Democrats subpoena Rick Perry in impeachment inquiry MORE, Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, last week became the first witness to testify in the investigation, which is centered on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

On Friday, Sondland\u2019s attorneys said despite the State Department\u2019s order not to testify, their client will abide by the congressional subpoena and appear before the Intelligence Committee. He will not, however, turn over any documents, which his attorneys said belong to State.\n\nSeparately, Democrats are also now interested in deposing Taylor, the U.S. charg\u00e9 d'affaires of Ukraine, who had threatened last month to quit over the Ukraine affair.

The administration, she testified in her opening statement, had conducted \"a concerted campaign\" against her.\n\nAnticipating a critical witness, the White House had sent a set of talking points to Capitol Hill as a line of defense.
