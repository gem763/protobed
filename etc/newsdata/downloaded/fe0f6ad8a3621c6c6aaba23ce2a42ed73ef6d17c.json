Conservatives see it as one of the first blows from an anti-Trump \u201cDeep State\u201d of Obama-Clinton loyalists.\n\nMr. Ignatius reported on intercepted phone calls between Flynn, the national security adviser in waiting, and Mr. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador.\n\nSuch transcripts are intelligence crown jewels. It is a felony to leak them. Plus, Mr. Kislyak now knew exactly when the U.S. eavesdropped.\n\nThe column sparked news stories in The Post and New York Times. Flynn subsequently resigned. He had told superiors he had not discussed sanctions with the Russian when he had. He ended up pleading guilty to lying to two FBI agents.\n\nHis new attorney, Sidney Powell, is waging a legal fight in U.S. District Court to have the judge dismiss the case due to prosecutor misconduct.\n\nIn a new U.S. District Court filing, Ms. Powell said she has requested the records of FBI spy Stefan Halper\u2019s work for the Pentagon Office of Net Assessment (ONA) and director James Baker. Mr. Halper, a Washington and British-based scholar, did studies for Mr. Baker. He spied on several Trump campaign aides.\n\n\u201cONA Director Baker regular lunched with Washington Post Reporter David Ignatius,\u201d Ms. Powell writes. \u201cBaker is believed to be the person who illegally leaked the transcript of Mr. Flynn\u2019s calls to Ignatius.\u201d\n\nA source told The Washington Times that Mr. Baker and the journalist had regular contact.\n\nThe Times sent Ms. Powell\u2019s court filing to Pentagon public affairs officials. A spokesperson declined to comment, citing the pending Flynn case.\n\nMs. Powell also says that Mr. Obama\u2019s top intelligence official, James Clapper, told Mr. Ignatius on Jan. 10 to \u201ctake the kill shot on Flynn.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Clapper told The Times that the Powell assertion is \u201cabsolutely false. It never happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cJim Clapper never said any such thing. In fact, he had no conversations with Ignatius at all on Jan. 10.\u201d\n\nMs. Powell said the prosecution has refused to hand over the Kislyak transcript.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
