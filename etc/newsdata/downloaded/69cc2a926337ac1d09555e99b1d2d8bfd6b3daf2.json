He was speaking just hours before sterling surged to $1.2750, its highest since May, on reports that a Brexit deal was close.\n\nCarney told the Treasury Select Committee yesterday: 'The major banks today in the UK are neutral. That ensures that when there is a sharp move, anticipated or not, the banks keep functioning.\n\n'Developments over the course of the next several days, several weeks, will have material impacts on the value of the pound, the value of shares, the cost of debt for UK banks and companies, in either direction.'\n\nHis comments came after the pound also rallied on hopes of a Brexit deal on Friday.\n\nCarney said other financial institutions and private investors stood to make a killing from swings in the pound.", "description": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the pound could soar or plunge depending on the outcome of talks between the UK and EU.
