I have no idea. They are not going to go to a Hollywood studio,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018And then when you get it made, where is it going to be shown, when the theatres are all being taken over by the theme park films? Theatres have become amusement parks. That is all fine and good but don\u2019t invade everything else in that sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That is fine and good for those who enjoy that type of film and, by the way, knowing what goes into them now, I admire what they do. It\u2019s not my kind of thing, it simply is not. It\u2019s creating another kind of audience that thinks cinemas is that.\n\n\u2018If you have a child and the child wants to see the picture, what are you going to do? It\u2019s up to you. The audience that sees them now, the fans that see those pictures now, they were raised on pictures like that.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018The technique is very well done but there is only one Spielberg, there is only one Lucas, James Cameron, it\u2019s a different thing now.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an invasion, so to speak, in the theatre.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nScorsese said putting his film The Irishman, which will also have a cinema release, on a streaming platform was the \u2018trade-off\u2019 for making it the way he wanted to.\n\nHe said: \u2018We are in a moment not only of evolution but of revolution, in pretty much the whole world, everything we know, the old political systems, it\u2019s almost as if the 21st century is beginning now and technology has gone with it and that means cinema goes with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Yes, see a movie in a theatre, it\u2019s the best with an audience, but the actual concept of cinema has become something that is not definable.\n\n\u2018Something can play as a hologram, something can play as virtual reality, maybe there is going to be an extraordinary epic in virtual reality at some point.\n\n\u2018We have to start expanding what we think of as narrative, music, literature, art and particularly the visual image.\u2019\n\nThe Irishman cast join Martin Scorcese at The Irishman premiere (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe 76-year-old \u2013 who directed Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Gangs Of The New York \u2013 previously told Empire magazine that he \u2018tried\u2019 to watch the Marvel films but he didn\u2019t feel they were \u2018cinema\u2019.\n\n\u2018Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nThe Irishman will be released in UK cinemas in November and will launch on Netflix later this year.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
