We must not allow that to happen.'\n\nNearly \u00a3200billion is lost from tax revenues every year because of avoidance efforts by multinationals, says the OECD.\n\nIt claimed its proposals amounted to the biggest shake-up of corporate tax rules since the 1920s.\n\nEuropean regulators have targeted companies including Apple and Amazon over tax, arguing they struck illegal 'sweetheart' deals with the Irish and Luxembourg governments and ordering them to pay back billions.\n\nBut the OECD said the problem should be tackled by a new system that would see firms pay a country taxes based on how much business they did there, regardless of whether they had staff or offices there.\n\nCountries like the UK, where technology firms rake in billions of pounds, stand to benefit from the proposal whereas low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Luxembourg would lose out.\n\nHowever the idea could still become derailed if battles break out between countries over how the new rules will be defined.\n\nThe plans were welcomed yesterday by some technology firms, with Facebook and Amazon saying they supported the OECD's efforts. But critics claimed the proposals did not go far enough.", "description": "The proposals would force big businesses, such a Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant Facebook, to pay more tax in countries where they generate 'significant' sales and profits.", "authors": ["Matt Oliver For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
