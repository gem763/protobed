Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has dropped its lawsuit against a group of constituents who accused him of being a \u201cfake farmer.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Nunes filed the lawsuit in Tulare County Superior Court last month, claiming the group and other parties \u2014 including McClatchy, parent company of the Fresno Bee newspaper \u2014 conspired with progressive \u201cdark money\u201d organizations to hurt Nunes\u2019 2018 reelection campaign.\n\nPeter Kapetan, the attorney who represented the campaign in the lawsuit, confirmed to the Bee on Wednesday that Nunes\u2019 campaign had dropped the litigation.\n\n\u201cWe gathered further evidence which supports the plaintiff\u2019s overriding concerns that dark money is being used to influence our elections,\u201d Kapetan said. \u201cGiven the new evidence recently discovered, the Nunes campaign committee voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, and the allegations underlining the lawsuit will be incorporated in a [racketeering] lawsuit filed in Virginia today.\u201d\n\nNunes\u2019 campaign did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for further comment.\n\nThe constituent group, which includes a retired farmer and an agrarian scholar, petitioned last year to change the text on Nunes\u2019 ballot label, which describes him to voters as a farmer. They argued that Nunes no longer farms and thus cannot justify calling himself a farmer on the California ballot.\n\nThe group also distributed mailers in Nunes\u2019 district referring to him as a \u201cfake farmer,\u201d according to The Hill.\n\nEsquire magazine reported last year that the Nunes family dairy farm moved to Iowa, thousands of miles from the lawmaker\u2019s California home, in 2006.\n\nSacramento Superior Court Judge Allen Sumner ultimately ruled that Nunes can continue to call himself a farmer.\n\nThe defendants in Nunes\u2019 suit included retired organic fruit tree farmer Paul Buxman, librarian Hope Nisly and agrarian scholar Daniel O\u2019Connell, as well as Michael Seeley, a member of the political group Southern California Americans for Democratic Action.\n\nIn an interview with the Bee last month, Buxman said he petitioned to have Nunes\u2019 ballot changed to make it \u201chonest.\u201d He said he had no idea what \u201cdark money\u201d is, and that he was not seeking any monetary damage or award. When he heard about the suit, he said, he prayed for Nunes.\n\nBrian Whelan, an attorney who represented Buxman and other defendants, said in a news release that his clients \u201cprevailed and won without having had to square off.\u201d\n\nThe new suit Kapetan alluded to is a $9.9 million federal conspiracy lawsuit, filed Wednesday, that names Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson and the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability. Fusion GPS is the opposition research firm behind the Steele dossier, a document made public in 2017 that outlined alleged ties between President Donald Trump and Russia. The Campaign for Accountability filed ethics complaints against Nunes last year.\n\nWhelan noted to the Bee that none of his clients are named in the new lawsuit.", "description": "The Republican lawmaker accused the group, which includes a retired fruit tree farmer, of conspiring with \"dark money\" organizations to hurt his campaign.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d714c77250000e213051a68.jpeg?cache=bopzoycq7t&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
