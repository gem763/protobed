Opponents were jailed or fled into exile.\n\nAmnesty International said authorities infiltrated human rights groups and harassed dissenters.\n\nReporters Without Borders branded Ben Ali a \u201cpress predator\u201d who controlled the media.\n\nBen Ali consistently won elections by large margins.\n\nIn 2009 he was re-elected to a fifth five-year term with 89 per cent of the vote.\n\nHe had warned political opponents they would face legal retaliation if they questioned the vote\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nUnder Ben Ali\u2019s watch, Tunisia was relatively untouched by the kind of Islamic extremist violence that wracked neighbouring Algeria, except for a 2002 attack on a synagogue on the Tunisian resort island of Djerba that killed 21 people, mostly German tourists.\n\nInvestigators linked the attack to al-Qaida.\n\nAfter the 2011 revolution, Islamic fundamentalism surged in some quarters and security services struggled against extremists linked to Isis.\n\nBen Ali is survived by his second wife, Leila Trabelsi, and their three children, who lived with him in exile, as well as by three children from his first marriage.\n\nAssociated Press", "description": "Former Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, an autocrat who led his country for 23 years before being toppled by protests that unleashed a wave of revolt across the Arab world, has died aged 83, his lawyer said.
