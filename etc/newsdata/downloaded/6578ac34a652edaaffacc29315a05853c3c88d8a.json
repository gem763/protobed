Actually maybe you have thought about that, because like, weed exists. Either way, they do. And sometimes they have babies. And now scientists have spotted one in the waters off Hawaii.\n\nAt this stage the wholphin is thought to be the first product of a union between a rough-toothed dolphin and a melon-headed whale. So far, that doesn\u2019t sound like the recipe for an attractive animal. Although speaking to CBS, biologist Robin Baird added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are more hybrids between the two species\u2015they do associate quite regularly.\u201d\n\nWatch: Using Drones to Gather Whale Snot\u2014For Science\n\nResearchers first spotted the guy, oh yeah it\u2019s a boy, while doing field work near Kauai. They saw a pod of whales and dolphins swimming together, and noticed one of the animals had \u201cpigmentation and morphological characteristics suggesting it may be a hybrid\u201d. In their report, published this month, they continued: \u201cThe head shape appears intermediate between the two species, with a gently-sloping rostrum rather than the rounded-head of a melon-headed whales but which is truncated compared to rough-toothed dolphins.\u201d Cute!\n\nTheir suspicions were later confirmed after they were able to get a skin and blubber sample from the animal. Speaking to Khon2, Robin Baird from the Cascadia Research Collective theorized that the coupling probably came about when a female whale was separated from her pod and joined up with a bunch of dolphins. So congrats to the happy couple!\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE AU.", "description": "Think of this majestic creature as the mule of the sea.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5b5e7a94cb86180008f2ca94/lede/1532918561205-37731909_1938299806201781_214540617231892480_o.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2018-07-31"}
