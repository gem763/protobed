Jim Cramer dove into the company's latest earnings report during his Mad Money program Tuesday night to find out.\n\nWhen Twitter missed earnings estimates back in July, no one seemed to care, Cramer recalled, as the company was showing both user growth and monetization. In retrospect, that shortfall should have been a red flag that there was more pain ahead. When the company reported last week, it once again missed the mark, posting a three-cents-a-share earnings miss that led to multiple analysts cutting estimates and downgrading the stock.\n\nCramer admitted that Twitter's recent tweaks to its advertising platform has proven to be misguided, but is that mistake worth 20% of the company's market cap? He said it's time to rethink the negativity. The stock deserved to get hit, but not this bad.\n\nIt's too late to sell TWTR, Cramer concluded. He instead advocated building a position on any further weakness. Let's visit with the charts to see how that might work.\n\nIn this daily Japanese candlestick chart of TWTR, below, we can see a big falling window which we call a bearish gap. The gap or window has plunged prices back down to its February/March lows. This area is not particularly great or impressive support but it may prompt some short-covering and buying.\n\nIf the $30-$29 area is broken then we have to look farther to the left to the December nadir for the next potential support zone. The candle bars are still red which tells us that prices are still closing below the opening and the bear is still in control. Prices are well below the declining 50-day moving average line and the now flat 200-day line. Trading volume surged sharply on the gap as traders and investors rushed to liquidate longs.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line turned sharply lower telling us that sellers were more aggressive. The 12-day price momentum study is telling us that the decline has not slowed yet and a bullish divergence is a way off.\n\nIn this weekly candlestick chart of TWTR, below, we can see that the $30-$26 area could well give us some support as it held in the not too distant past in 2018.\n\nPrices are below the 40-week moving average line and the OBV line has been weakening from early September. The 12-week price momentum study is not hopeful.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of TWTR, below, we can see the sharp decline without the gap or void of prices - this is the way Point and Figure charts are constructed. The volume by price information on the left side of the chart shows some volume was transacted in the $30-$26 area so maybe buyers will defend that area.\n\nBottom line strategy: Looking at these three charts of TWTR (above) I would suggest that one wait for a reversal pattern on the candlestick chart (there are many to choose from) before probing the long side of TWTR. Decide on a risk point before your first purchase.", "description": "If it's too late to sell do we build a position on any further weakness?...TWTR", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Here'S A Technical Strategy For Twitter", "If It'S Too Late To Sell Do We Build A Position On Any Further Weakness", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Helene Meisler", "Eric Jhonsa", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/858a2bdd-f667-11e9-93dd-970707563a3a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
