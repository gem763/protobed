Giuliani, in handling Ukraine because they wanted to improve relations between the U.S. and the Eastern European country.\n\nDemocrats have subpoenaed Mr. Perry for documents related to their investigation.\n\nPreviously, Mr. Perry served as governor of Texas from the end of 2000 to the start of 2015. He is the longest-serving governor in the state\u2019s history.\n\nTexas is emerging as a political battleground state, despite its deep-red reputation.\n\nMr. Trump late Thursday targeted former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democratic presidential candidate from El Paso who gave Sen. Ted Cruz a tough race in 2018, for threatening to revoke the tax-exempt status of houses of worship that oppose same-sex marriage.\n\nThe president also blasted Mr. O\u2019Rourke for proposing a mandatory buyback of AR-15s and similar rifles.\n\nNeither of those pitches will play well in Texas, Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump also scolded Democrats, broadly, for pursuing his impeachment. He said they cannot win at the ballot box so they dream up ways to come after him.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t believe, anymore, that they love our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said, before slamming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: \u201cThat Crazy Nancy. She is crazy.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump reiterated his complaints about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter, who had business ties with Ukraine and China while his father served in the Obama administration.\n\nAnd he fumed over the secret identity of the government official who blew the whistle on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which he asked the foreign leader for help in investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the whistleblower, who\u2019s the whistleblower?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have to know.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jeff Mordock contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
