A further 640 LGBT Bangladeshis and 389 Nigerians had their claims on the same grounds refused during the period.\n\nIn Pakistan, \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d is punishable with life in prison, while Amnesty reports that \u201ctransgender people continued to suffer harassment and violent attacks\u201d there. In Bangladesh, Amnesty reports that \u201cLGBTI activists continued to be routinely harassed and subject to arbitrary detention by state and non-state actors\u201d.\n\nIn Nigeria, homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in prison and displays of same-sex affection are also outlawed. After Pakistan and Bangladesh, Nigeria produces the largest number of asylum claims based on sexual orientation.\n\nUsing data from the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, the Lib Dems separated out countries where same-sex acts were criminalised. Applications for asylum on grounds of sexual orientation were also refused for nationals of Cameroon (136), Ghana (144), Iran (124) and Uganda (145) as well as Iraq, Jamaica and Malaysia.\n\nChristine Jardine, the Lib Dems\u2019 spokesperson for home affairs, said: \u201cThis Conservative government is letting down every LGBT+ person and every individual in this country who cares about human rights. We should be leading the campaign across the world against homophobia and transphobia. Instead we have a government that is turning its back and looking the other way.\n\n\u201cThese figures are a disturbing reminder that this Conservative government is failing to stand up for LGBT+ rights by refusing asylum to more than 1,000 people a year who face prosecution at home simply for who they are. The Liberal Democrats demand better for LGBT+ people wherever they live. We will establish a new, dedicated unit to handle asylum claims, free of political interference and without the Home Office\u2019s culture of disbelief.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the Home Office refused 970 LGBT claims from nationals of countries where same-sex acts were criminalised, down from 1,096 in 2017 and 1,043 in 2016.\n\nLast year, LGBT asylum was brought into focus by the case of a Nigerian man who fled to Britain to avoid prosecution for being gay.\n\nAdeniyi Raji, who was sacked for his sexuality, received threats on social media in Nigeria, which included comments such as, \u201cI really wish you were killed that very day \u2026\u201d, \u201cYou know gay practice is an abomination in our land\u201d, and \u201cYou better stop your gay practice, if not you could get yourself killed in this country\u201d.\n\nThe Home Office rejected his claim, which was upheld by the first-tier immigration tribunal. He is appealing against the decision but faces deportation.\n\nThe challenges faced by LGBT asylum seekers were further highlighted by a case in which a first-tier immigration tribunal judge rejected the claim of a man because he did not have a gay \u201cdemeanour\u201d.\n\nThe judge said he did not accept the man applying to stay in the UK was gay and contrasted his appearance with that of a witness who \u201cwore lipstick\u201d and had an \u201ceffeminate\u201d manner, who the judge accepted was gay.\n\nIn July, the high court ordered the Home Office to help a woman eturn to Britain after she was refused asylum on grounds of sexuality and deported to Uganda. The judge on the case said it was \u201cprocedurally unfair\u201d.\n\nIf the judgment stands, the woman would be the first deportee whose case was processed through fast-track rules operational between 2005 and 2015 to return to the UK and appeal against the decision to deport her.\n\nThe ruling could encourage similar appeals from thousands of people whose asylum claims were treated under the same system.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIndividuals are only returned to their country of origin when the Home Office and courts deem it is safe to do so.\n\n\u201cEach case is considered on its individual merits against relevant case law and published country information, and all decisions on claims based on sexual orientation are reviewed by an experienced caseworker.\n\n\u201cThe UK has a proud record of providing protection to those fleeing persecution. Over 12 months, we gave protection to more than 18,500 people, the highest number since 2003.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: \u2018culture of disbelief\u2019 excludes at least 3,100 nationals from countries outlawing same-sex acts", "authors": ["Jamie Grierson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1228169cf145b97922b9f06f6b91f8572965ce9/0_239_3927_2355/master/3927.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad5c50527f0c214dc2e525f97ada87e7"}
