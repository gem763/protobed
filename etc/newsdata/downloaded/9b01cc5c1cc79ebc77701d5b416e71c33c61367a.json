Fortunately for Kanye, he caught himself before doing so, but his explanation wasn\u2019t much better.\n\nWhile talking about how people can relate to his music because of his own experiences, Kanye said, \u201cIf it was just, \u2018Oh, we grew up with this guy\u2019s music and now he\u2019s a superstar\u2019, it\u2019s less compelling than, \u2018Oh, this guy had a mental breakdown. This guy was in debt. This guy\u2019s been through\u2026\u2019\u201d That\u2019s when Kanye caught himself before saying something that could have gotten him in trouble at home. But again, the save wasn\u2019t much better. \u201cYa know, not been through, but this guy has a beautiful five years of marriage,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cYou know, marriage years are different than human \u2014 like, you know how dogs are, what is it, seven years? Every marriage year is like a hundred years. It\u2019s like 500 years of marriage.\u201d\n\nMarriage comments aside, Kanye\u2019s Airpool Karaoke appearance was pretty epic. The rapper has famously bailed on Carpool Karaoke on multiple occasions, but Kanye made up for it by strapping in not only himself and Corden, but his entire choir and performed the 2004 hit \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d Kanye, whose new album is titled \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d has spoken a lot recently about his newfound relationship with God, and it\u2019s that relationship that compelled him to change the lyrics to \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d\n\nWhere Kanye used to rap, \u201cI wanna talk to God but I\u2019m afraid \u2018cause we ain\u2019t spoke in so long,\u201d he now says, \u201cI wanna talk to God, I ain\u2019t afraid.\u201d\n\nThe Late Late Show With James Corden airs weeknights at 12:35 .m. on CBS.\n\nCheck out why Kanye West says God is using him, the choir and his family:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think!
