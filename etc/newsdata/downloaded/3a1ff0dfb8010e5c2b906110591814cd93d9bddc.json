In an ideal world, the cart is loaded with food and beverages, driven to the plane, and, finally, unloaded without incident. In the world of delivering food and beverages to planes, what I have just described is considered a textbook food and beverage delivery.\n\nIn contrast to this, what has been captured in the video below is very much not considered a textbook delivery:\n\nCrazy event at ORD.

Klauer told Mashable that he saw a case of water fall off the seat and onto the accelerator pedal which, combined with the position that the wheel was in, caused the cart to speed up while autonomously performing some sick donuts.\n\nThe cart continued to spin out of control \u2014 spilling out and subsequently running over cans of drink and packets of food \u2014 until it got perilously close to the nose cone of an adjacent aircraft. Luckily, it was intercepted by some industrious soul driving another vehicle, who managed to ram into the cart and flip it onto its side, in an act not at all dissimilar to Lord Humungus ramming his car directly into the tanker at the end of Mad Max 2.\n\nRest in peace, brave food and beverage cart.", "description": "A catering cart with a case of water bottles on the accelarator went absolutely fucking nuts earlier today at Chicago O'Hare airport.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-4.30.28-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
