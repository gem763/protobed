Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\u201d\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials on Sunday confirmed hundreds of detainees at the Ain Issa camp had escaped amid Turkish airstrikes and intense fighting in the area.\n\nMr Trump then tweeted that \u201cTurkey and the Kurds must not let them escape\u201d. He added: \u201cEurope should have taken them back after numerous requests. They should do it now.\u201d\n\nAmong the detainees at Ain Issa were British sisters Reema and Zara Iqbal, who married Isis fighters after travelling to Syria in 2013. The UK government decided to strip them of their citizenship rather than bring them back for trial.\n\nLast week the US president, who has repeatedly criticised European countries for not taking back Isis families, appeared unconcerned by the possibility of a breakout.\n\n\u201cWell they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe, that\u2019s where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes,\u201d he said. \u201dBut Europe didn\u2019t want them from us. We could have given it to them, they could have trials, they could have done whatever they wanted.\u201d\n\nThe US is believed to have taken custody of some of the most dangerous Isis prisoners, including the captured British \u201cBeatles\u201d suspects Alexanda Kotey, 35, and El Shafee Elsheikh, 30.\n\nOther detainees at Ain Issa included Tooba Gondal, a former student from east London who is accused of recruiting teenage girls to join the terror group, and three English-speaking orphans who were discovered by the BBC shortly before the Turkish offensive.\n\nIsis bride Shamima Begum, who has been told she will never be allowed back to the UK, is being held in a different camp, Roj, near the Iraqi border.\n\n(Statista) More\n\nMr Trump\u2019s surprise announcement of a US withdrawal came after he spoke with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the phone.\n\nTurkey claimed its military operation, launched on Wednesday, was designed to establish a 20-mile \u201csafe zone\u201d for refugees and described Kurdish forces as terrorists.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has now struck a deal with Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government to repel the Turkish offensive.\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been forced to flee border areas as a result of fighting between Turkish-led forces and Kurdish militia, according to the United Nations.\n\nRead more\n\nNearly 800 \u2018Isis-linked women and children escape from Syrian camp\u2019", "description": "Donald Trump lashed out at Europe after hundreds of Isis prisoners escaped during the Turkish offensive in northern Syria.The US president said that the UK and other EU countries \u201cshould have taken back\u201d the captured fighters and their families instead of leaving them in camps guarded by Kurdish forces", "authors": ["Peter Stubley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SWDyCK__NZ.7_Iwv5r8KrA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/91359cf512743b7d37c8d3c61d1a5ca9", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
