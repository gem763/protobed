The government hopes to start operating in the city as early as next year, although the project is facing reported delays\n\nIndonesia announced similar plans in August, picking a jungle-covered area of eastern Borneo for its new capital, which will replace Jakarta.\n\nThe two countries are facing similar problems -- both Cairo and Jakarta are overcrowded and congested -- but Jakarta is also one of the world's fastest-sinking cities. It is dropping into the Java Sea due to the over-extraction of its underground water sources, which is causing land subsidence.\n\nBuilding a capital from scratch, however, is nothing new, and many of today's world capitals are purpose-built, including Washington DC (United States), Brasilia (Brazil), Ottawa (Canada) and Canberra (Australia).\n\nThe Parliament House in Canberra, capital of Australia.

And the pick was none of the above, with the Potomac (River) being the boundary between the two.\n\n\"The same thing happened in Canada, where the Ottawa River was the boundary between the French-speaking lower Canada and the English-speaking upper Canada. Canberra is partway between Melbourne and Sydney. New Delhi was halfway between Calcutta and Mumbai. And so on.\"\n\nAccording to Gordon, most constructed capitals follow one of three planning models: a grand European-style city with large boulevards, modeled on Paris, which was widely considered to be the most beautiful and best planned city in the 1900s; the so-called \"garden city,\" born in England and based on self-contained communities surrounded by green areas; and a modernist approach, which came to the fore after World War II and was appealing because it was an international style, helping achieve the neutrality that many planned capitals aimed for, as opposed to local or national styles.\n\nThe Capitol building in Washington, DC.

You can demolish a building from the 1960s, even if it's designed by Oscar Niemeyer, as long as you replace it with the same volumes,\" said Pinto.\n\nHowever, Brasilia has arguably failed in its grand aim of becoming an open and egalitarian capital, and is instead marred by social segregation, according to Pinto.\n\n\"Brazil has a history of social segregation,\" he said. \"Lucio Costa, the designer, assumed that he was being equal by guaranteeing that both a judge and a janitor would have a place in the city, but he forgot about the hundred of thousands of people who built the city and were expected to go back to their (home states) but didn't. And for those people, the city didn't provide anything.\n\n\"They lived in slums. When Brasilia was inaugurated, these people were relocated in just one day. And they were relocated further away, in new metropolitan areas. (The planners) tried to make a more egalitarian city, a fair city, but they failed.\"\n\nThe Brazilian National Congress building in Brasilia.

People said it was a plan without a city. There were huge gaps. The Washington monument was built in the wrong space. It took another hundred years, but now it's hard not to say that Washington is a success.\n\n\"Building a capital city is a very long-term exercise. My advice is to aim high, keep your vision on the long term and stick to the plan.\"\n\nBrowse the gallery above to discover some of the world's planned capitals.", "description": "Many of the world's capital cities are planned cities, built from scratch -- and they will soon be joined by the future capitals of Egypt and Indonesia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190918163344-gettyimages-528865988-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
