Because when you have a gun to your head, you don\u2019t have any other choice but to retaliate,\u201d he added.\n\nThe tariffs, which took effect just after midnight in Washington (0401 GMT), came after talks between European officials and US trade representatives failed to win a last-minute reprieve.\n\nIn the line of fire are civilian aircraft from Britain, France, Germany and Spain \u2014 the countries that formed Airbus \u2014 which will now cost 10 percent more when imported to the US.\n\nBut the tariffs also target consumer products such as French wine, which Trump had vowed to attack in recent months. Wine from France, Spain and Germany will now face 25 percent tariffs.\n\nLe Maire was due to meet US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer later on Friday.\n\nThe Europeans advocate negotiation over conflict and expect the World Trade Organization next year will authorize Europe to retaliate against the United States for subsidizing Boeing.\n\nBut EU officials had already offered in July to call a truce on subsidies for plane makers, in which both sides would admit fault and agree to curtail state aid \u2014 to no avail. The two sides have been involved in a row over the subsidies for 15 years.\n\nThe tariffs kick in just days after the United States was given the formal go-ahead by the World Trade Organization.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday, Trump singled out the Europeans for being unfair with the United States on trade, but said his door was open to negotiate a settlement.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Very hard\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Europeans fear above all that Trump will impose heavy duties on imports of European cars around mid-November.\n\nThis would be a serious blow for the German automotive sector in particular, even if giants such as Volkswagen or BMW also manufacture in the United States.\n\n\u201cOur products are very hard to bring in (to Europe)\u201d when Europeans easily import their cars into the United States, Trump said.\n\nThe Airbus-Boeing row is just one of several issues stoking transatlantic tensions that quickly descended into acrimony when Trump took office in 2017.\n\nTrump embraced a protectionist agenda, slapping import duties on steel and aluminum from the EU and other allies, while also threatening tariffs on cars.\n\nTrade groups in Europe such as winemakers, German tool manufacturers and whisky producers in Scotland have kept a clamor of protest, demanding Washington reverse tack.\n\nThe US leader and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed in July 2018 to a ceasefire in the conflict to hold trade talks that have so far led nowhere.\n\nThe epic legal battle between Airbus and Boeing at the World Trade Organization began in 2004 when Washington accused Britain, France, Germany and Spain of providing illegal subsidies and grants to support the production of a range of Airbus products.\n\nA year later, the EU alleged that Boeing had received $19.1 billion worth of prohibited subsidies from 1989 to 2006 from various branches of the US government.\n\nThe two cases were then tangled up in a legal quagmire, with each side being given partial vindication after a long series of appeals and counter appeals.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The United States imposed tariffs on a record $7.5-billion worth of European Union goods on Friday, despite threats of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/37ef43_epic-legal-battle-airbus-boeing-world-trade-organization-began-in-2004-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
