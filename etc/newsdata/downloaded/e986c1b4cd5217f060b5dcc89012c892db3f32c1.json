U.S. officials say they and others directed by Pyongyang represent a key source of revenue for the government.\n\nThat illicit finance is used by the government to fund its weapons programs and to insulate it against the global sanctions program meant to coerce leader Kim Jong Un into giving up his nuclear weapons, officials say.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets those entities may have within U.S.\u2019s jurisdiction and prevent anyone involved with them from traveling to the U.S. Members of the groups also are at risk of being sanctioned themselves.\n\nIt is unclear how much money, if any, the groups have in the U.S., although public exposure through the Treasury Department action could increase scrutiny and impact their operations.\n\nTreasury\u2019s action targets the Lazarus Group hacking initiative, blamed for the so-called WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack and its two associated units, Bluenoroff and Andariel, that collectively have allegedly stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from state and private banks.\n\nNorth Korean officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration previously has blamed North Korea for the WannaCry worm, which was unleashed in 2017, infecting more than 300,000 computers in more than 150 countries, crippling banks, hospitals and other companies.\n\nA year ago, the Justice Department announced charges against a North Korean operative, Park Jin Hyok, and unnamed co-conspirators for allegedly working for the outfit to steal money and information at the direction of Pyongyang through cyberattacks, including WannaCry and the 2014 hack on Sony Pictures.\n\nProsecutors also accused Mr. Park of playing a role in the theft of $81 million from Bangladesh\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2016, which prosecutors said was the largest ever successful cyber theft from a financial institution.\n\nWrite to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com and Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. imposed sanctions on three hacking operations it says are run by North Korean intelligence services and have stolen millions from banks and others around the world.", "authors": ["Ian Talley", "Dustin Volz", "Ian.Talley Wsj.Com", "Dustin.Volz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106962/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
