She was found dead after 5pm on Tuesday\n\nA post-mortem revealed she suffered catastrophic injuries to her jaw and a large wound to her head (shown), and that a ship strike was the main cause of death\n\nRare sightings of the whale had delighted onlookers and whale watchers, who flocked to the banks of the Thames to catch a glimpse of the elusive animal (shown before its death)\n\nThe dead body of Hessy is loaded onto a trailer at Gravesend on Tuesday, on its way for dissection by the Zoological Society of London\n\nHe said: 'ZSL's examination revealed that it was an 8.37 metre-long juvenile female, had no evidence of recent feeding and was nutritionally compromised.\n\n'The whale also had a heavy burden of parasites within the intestine, and no evidence of plastic ingestion was found.\n\n'There was also evidence of historical entanglement or other interactions with human activity, with linear scars on the dorsal fin (located on the back of the animal) and tail flukes.\n\n'The main finding was a large wound on the underside of the head, associated with a fracture along the length of one of the mandibles (lower jaw).\n\n'Traces of blood clots around the fractured jaw and haemorrhage around the cut/torn surfaces indicate that the damage occurred before death and it was the team's opinion that the injuries were most likely a result of ship strike and this is considered to be the primary cause of death.\n\n'It's certainly possible that the whale was struck outside of the Thames and already had these injuries whilst it was seen swimming within the river at the beginning of the week - further test of tissues taken during the examination are ongoing and may shed further light on the likely timescale around the injuries.\n\nExperts say it is likely the juvenile whale made a navigational error and swam up the Thames from the North Sea last week on a spring tide when the water level was at its highest\n\nThe Zoological Society of London dissects whales and dolphins found washed up on UK shores to dry and understand why they died\n\nA spokesman for the Port of London authority described the recovery operation last night. He said: 'We managed to secure the whale to the larger of the boats, the Kew, and then began dragging it. The whale was so big and heavy that the Kew was only able to do one and a half miles an hour'\n\nA map showing how the typical migration route of a humpback whale passes the UK's north coast. This particular whale was not following the usual pattern\n\n'This examination was very much a collaborative effort and could not have happened without the considerable support and efforts of colleagues from Port of London Authority and British Divers Marine Life Rescue.'\n\nTwo Port of London Authority boats and one RNLI lifeboat recovered the body at around 6.30pm on Tuesday.\n\nA spokesman for the Port of London authority said the whale was found underneath the Dartford Crossing.\n\nRare sightings of the whale had delighted onlookers and whale watchers, who flocked to the banks of the Thames to catch a glimpse of the elusive animal.\n\nExperts say it is likely the juvenile whale made a navigational error and swam up the Thames from the North Sea last week on a spring tide when the water level was at its highest.\n\nAnother humpback whale which entered the Thames 10 years ago is known to have died of starvation.\n\nThe exact cause of Hessy's death will be determined following analysis from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme at London Zoo.\n\nIt is the fifth humpback whale to be recorded stranded in the UK by the programme.\n\nBenny the beluga whale rose to national fame when he was spotted in the River Thames last year.\n\nExperts believe the juvenile whale made a navigational error and swam up the Thames from the North Sea last week on a spring tide when the water level is at its highest\n\nThe whale has signs of 'historic entanglement' scarring on its dorsal fin but looks unharmed apart from that", "description": "A post-mortem revealed Hessy, found dead in the River Thames on Tuesday, suffered catastrophic injuries to her jaw and a large wound to her head, and that a ship strike was the main cause of death.", "authors": ["Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19593692-0-image-a-53_1570804713361.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
