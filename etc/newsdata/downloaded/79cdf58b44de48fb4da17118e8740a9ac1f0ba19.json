Neo-Nazi groups have continued to promulgate this trope in recent years, specifically referring to Jewish \u201ctentacles.\u201d\n\nA frequent guest of Dobbs\u2019, Judicial Watch\u2019s Chris Farrell, was banned from Fox airwaves last year after he claimed migrant caravans from Central America were funded by the \u201cSoros-occupied State Department,\u201d parroting the anti-Semitic smear of a \u201cZionist-controlled government.\u201d\n\nTwo days after Farrell made his comments, an anti-Semite killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The shooter believed that Soros and other Jews were trying to replace whites through immigration.\n\nThis also isn\u2019t the first time the \u201ctentacle\u201d trope has been used by a Fox host. Back in 2015, then-Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly called Soros the \u201cshadow puppet master\u201d who \u201chas his tentacles into political organizations.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Dobbs\u2014who serves as an informal adviser to the president\u2014was seen entering the White House on Wednesday afternoon.", "description": "The tropes of \u201cpuppet masters\u201d and Jewish \u201ctentacles\u201d ensnaring various political institutions and organizations have been around for decades, if not longer.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568253158/lou-dobbs-tonight_17_jddil2", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
