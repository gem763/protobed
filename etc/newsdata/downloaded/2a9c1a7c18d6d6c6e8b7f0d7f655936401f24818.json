On the night of Game 1 in Houston against the Astros, a racially diverse crowd of thousands turned out in the midst of a cold rainstorm to watch the game on television together in Nationals Park.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no politics in baseball,\u201d said Beth Leeth, a Virginia resident who came to the park with her husband and four children. She continued the \u201cLeague of Their Own\u201d analogy by adding, \u201cThere IS crying sometimes. We\u2019ve been Nats fans long enough that there\u2019s been some tears over the Nationals. But not this year.\u201d\n\nJudith Gilbert, a 25-year DC resident, said, \u201cYou can feel it. It\u2019s palpable in the community. It doesn\u2019t matter what your political persuasion is at the moment. It\u2019s helping us deal with the other stuff that\u2019s really terribly frightening that\u2019s going on politically. This is something that\u2019s an antidote to that.\u201d\n\nAs the nation\u2019s capital, Washington is split by the passions and anger surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and the impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-led House. As a city of 700,000 people, Washington is overwhelmingly Democratic. Still, a fast-moving gentrification wave has produced a host of racial and economic tensions with longtime black residents fearing that DC\u2019s \u201cChocolate City\u201d identity is being erased.\n\nNationals fever has even popped up inside Trump\u2019s White House. Trump said Thursday he planned to attend Game 5 on Sunday if there is one.\n\nOn Oct. 17, at the start of what would become a disastrous press conference that may have strengthened the impeachment case against his boss, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney started off with a Nationals reference.\n\n\u201cI did want to come out here with my Nationals hat on but they told that would violate some type of rule,\u201d he joked.\n\nWashington is a city filled with transplants, many of whom bring their hometown sports loyalties with them. There also isn\u2019t much of a local history of baseball success. Two separate incarnations of the Washington Senators have left town, becoming the Minnesota Twins and the Texas Rangers. From 1972 until 2005, when the Montreal Expos relocated here, a generation of local fans was forced to either live without a hometown favorite or unnaturally root for the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nBut Nationals fever has become undeniable. That was evident last week when the fourth Democratic presidential debate went head-to-head with the Nationals\u2019 game 4 against the St. Louis Cardinals. Normally the bars of Capitol Hill would have been packed with debate-watching parties, but instead baseball seemed to decisively dominate politics.\n\n\u201cWe need this. We really do need this,\u201d said Rowena De Leon of Rockville, Maryland. \u201cWith the country so divided, this is just something that\u2019s good and something to cheer for.\u201d\n\nPart of the charm of this year\u2019s team is their underdog story. After the Nationals lost their best player, Bryce Harper to free agency, very little was expected of this year\u2019s squad. Even squeaking into the playoffs as a wild card was considered a pleasant surprise. From there the team has somehow morphed into a juggernaut. After winning the first two games in Houston, the Nationals return home Friday for Game 3 with an eight-game playoff winning streak and in the unlikely role of World Series favorite.\n\nA Nationals victory would also continue the recent championship streak for a city largely accustomed to sports futility. The Capitals won hockey\u2019s Stanley Cup in 2018 after years of near-misses, and the Washington Mystics won their first WNBA title in September.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting the same vibe as 2018 when the Capitals won the Stanley Cup and everybody just embraced everybody\u201d said Ted Peters, a Nats superfan who comes to games dressed like a cruise ship captain and goes by the name Captain Obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of oneness. It\u2019s us against the world. It\u2019s a fantastic feeling and you can feel it throughout the city.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards and the Redskins remain mired in long-term mediocrity, but Washingtonians will absolutely take what they can get.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington is normally a city defined by its divisions, be they political, racial or economic.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ashraf Khalil"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/25/nationals_fever_61508_c0-188-4515-2821_s1200x700.jpg?3ef51748e13494bd9bc26c2cb6a60844002213e0", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
