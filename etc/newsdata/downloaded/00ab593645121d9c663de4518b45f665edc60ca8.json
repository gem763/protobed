Three months later, she has had the eyes of almost 25,000 fans on her in two of the country's grandest stadiums.\n\nNeville embodies the gravity-defying journey women's football has been on in the last few years. Until the start of this season, Neville was juggling her football career at Tottenham Hotspur with a full-time job teaching special needs children in Birmingham, and coaching them in football. Now that Spurs have been promoted to the Women\u2019s Super League (WSL) she is free to dedicate all her time to the game because top division players are fully paid professionals.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people thought football was just a bit of a hobby for me,\u201d says Neville who asked to delay the start of her pre-season training with Tottenham until the end of the school term. \u201cI was in a school Monday to Friday and then I trained two nights a week. I would travel down from Birmingham to London in the evenings after work, staying until about 10pm, and then on a Sunday for games.\u201d\n\nThe decision to give up her job at Cedars Academy junior school and move to London for the new season was not easy. Alongside her role as a sports coach Neville was responsible for a lot of pastoral care sessions with children with special educational and behavioural needs. For many kids, she was a precious emotional outlet.", "description": "Until recently, Ashleigh Neville's football was watched by 30 children in a school playground.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000207636688-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
