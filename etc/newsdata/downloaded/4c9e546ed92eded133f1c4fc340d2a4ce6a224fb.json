Draymond Green was awful.\"\n\n\"Draymond Green shouldn't say, 'We sucked.' He needs to look in the mirror.

He finished with 11 points on 3-of-6 shooting in 28 minutes, but also injured his elbow early in the first quarter and played through the pain with a heavy bandage on his arm.\n\nStory continues\n\nGreen wasn't wreaking havoc on defense like he normally does, but the Dubs' two dynamic scorers, Steph Curry and D'Angelo Russell, weren't at their best either. They combined to shoot an inefficient 14-of-36 from the field, which included Curry shooting just 2-for-11 on 3-pointers. The Warriors' starting center, Kevon Looney, only played 10 minutes after experiencing hamstring tightness and their other center, Willie Cauley-Stein, remains sidelined with a midfoot sprain.\n\n[RELATED: Warriors' new normal will be tough pill for fans to swallow]\n\nSo yes, Draymond wasn't great. But neither was Curry, Russell, or any of the Warriors' core. The Clippers are championship contenders and played like it. The Warriors still are figuring out their identity after an offseason of change.\n\nThe Warriors and Draymond will have better days. But to put the loss all on one player? That's just ridiculous.\n\nRelated content from TMZ Sports\n\nAB retaking condo-trashing deposition during Week 12\n\nFormer Dodger Paul Lo Duca sued by MLB umpire\n\nVallejo native CC Sabathia posts emotional retirement letter\n\nChris Bosh calls Tyler Herro 'best rookie in the draft'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraymond Green roasted by Cris Carter after Warriors' loss to Clippers originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Draymond wasn't great vs. the Clippers, but the loss isn't all on him.", "authors": ["Jon Williams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TZiBAur4.qe5694IdjNJ9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Xni4eAG6IN_GdARsDW.ybw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/5b5c18074a0ae435400cfbf661ab709c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
