That led some to believe the IPO had been mispriced by its lead bank, JPMorgan. The company's CEO went as far as to complain to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to find out what went wrong with the listing, Business Insider reported this week.\n\nIt remains to be seen how other buzzy companies will fare in the markets this year. WeWork's IPO remains on ice, at least through the Jewish holidays in October, as investors have grown disillusioned with the company's unclear path to profitability, business model, complex structure, hefty valuation, and controversial governance.\n\nOn the flip side, we went to Peloton's investor-road-show stop in New York this week, where we saw potential investors snapping selfies with star instructors alongside the buzzy exercise company's $2,000 bikes. Overall, portfolio managers we spoke with said they were excited about Peloton's prospects, despite the struggles of other consumer-facing companies to list this year, like Uber and Lyft (both are trading below their IPO prices).\n\nAnd, of course, everyone is holding their breath for Saudi Aramco, which could be history's largest IPO whenever it goes public \u2014 the latest reporting pegs it in 2020 or 2021.\n\nI can't believe it's finally fall! In true seasonal fashion last weekend, we went pumpkin and apple picking, and now have way too many Honeycrisps. I'm in the market for some recipes to use up everything from my apple haul. Any ideas?\n\nAs always, let us know what we should be writing about!\n\nOlivia", "description": "Wall Street Insider is a behind-the-scenes look at the stories dominating banking, business, and big deals.", "authors": ["Olivia Oran"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d84f2d92e22af6ebb47e3d6-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
