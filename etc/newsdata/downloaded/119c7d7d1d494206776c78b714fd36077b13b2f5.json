The pair struggled to make a clear break above the 108.00 handle and shifted to the 100-DMA around 107.80. Traders continue to closely monitor developments on the trade front, with risk sentiment has deteriorated amid last Friday\u2019s reports that the Trump administration was considering curbs in investments into China including delisting Chinese companies from US stock exchanges. Such a step would be a significant escalation in the trade tensions between the two countries.\n\nAs such, the yen demand may persist in the near term. Moreover, the selling pressure in the risky assets segment could increase should fresh economic data disappoint and confirm the threat of a recession. Technically, the pair may retreat to the 107.40 support, from where it could bounce higher should risk demand reemerge. Otherwise, could get back to the 107.00 area in the medium term.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Helen Rush covering: USD/JPY.
