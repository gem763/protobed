They held each other's hands away from the cameras, and kept smiling at each other.\n\n\"They wouldn't even let go to walk down the stairs into the dinner room. Perhaps she needed his support while wearing that black dress, but David looked more than happy to be so close to her.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Former Strictly star David James cuddles up to ex dance partner Nadiya Bychkova as they hold hands at Pride of Britain", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "David Dyson Daily Mirror", "David Fisher Rex", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20745436.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pride-of-Britain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
