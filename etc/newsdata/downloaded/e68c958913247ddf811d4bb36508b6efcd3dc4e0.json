The justices will determine whether LGBTQ people are covered under existing anti-discrimination measures for workplaces as outlined in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, or whether such discrimination is legal.\n\nIf the justices find that gender identity and sexual orientation are covered under the existing civil rights law, this will mean that the LGBTQ people will be protected from being fired regardless of whether or not individual states mandate it.\n\nSimilarly to the 2013 Defense of Marriage decision and 2015 Marriage Equality Act, the polarizing court case will decide the fate of 11.3 million LGBTQ Americans.\n\nAs with precedent-making cases before it, the White House has taken a particular interest in these cases. Earlier this year, the Trump Administration filed two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court. One argues that transgender people are not covered under existing civil rights law, the other argues that sexuality-based discrimination is also not covered under the existing laws.\n\nIn order to understand what rights might be at stake for LGBTQ people and why the Trump administration's stance has been met with staunch backlash, here's a quick breakdown of the court cases being heard, the civil rights law in question, and what the possible outcomes could mean for LGBTQ people in the United States.\n\nThe arguments rely on different interpretations of the 1964 Civil Rights Act\n\nPassed as the culmination of years of activism and organizing during the Civil Rights Movement, the 1964 Civil Rights Act federally mandated standards for employers, banning discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.\n\nTitle VII of the law states that discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" by employers is illegal. The question is over the definition of the \"sex\" part.\n\ngay rights More\n\nREUTERS/Marvin Gentry\n\nThe Trump administration has argued in its two amicus briefs filed to the Supreme Court that \"sex,\" as it was defined when the 1964 Civil Rights Act was passed, refers to the \"biological sex\" of a person \u2014 a definition that doesn't include protections based on transgender identity. \"Biological sex\" is defined in this argument as the sex someone is assigned at birth rather than the gender someone identifies as, and is primarily based off physical characteristics about a person's body like hormones and genitalia as well as chromosomes \u2014 though the idea of two definitive binary biological sexes, male and female, has been recently challenged by researchers, intersex advocates, and the mainstream media.\n\nCongress would need to explicitly expand the meaning of the law to cover transgender status, the Trump administration argued.\n\n\"The 55 years since Title VII's original enactment have witnessed societal and cultural change in this area,\" the brief argues. \"Congress could eventually conclude that changes since 1964 warrant expanding the statute's scope to reach beyond sex to encompass transgender status. But that is exclusively a question for Congress.\"", "description": "Here's a breakdown of the 3 court cases being heard, the civil rights law in question, and what outcomes could mean for LGBTQ people in the US.", "authors": ["Canela L\u00f3pez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/01bc4tLE.RN4j5lGp71c5A--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/23ea618dbf8253a020ea97e47b1f20da", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
