Observations revealed its light dimmed regularly, as do distant stars when their planets pass in front of them. But while the stars of most exoplanet systems are seen to dim by a few per cent, KIC 8462852 dimmed by more than 20 per cent over periods of months. Some have claimed this dimming could be evidence of a Dyson Sphere \u2013 a hypothetical structure which could be used by an advanced alien race to harness the energy of a star. Scientists remain skeptical, offering that the dimming could be explained by a dust ring around the star or a hail of comets passing in between the star and Earth.\n\nIn a forthcoming paper, researchers at UC Berkeley point to all the unusual activity coming from HD 139139 as a reason to make it a focus of study.\n\n'The mystery behind the origin of these events makes this system an interesting target for technosignature searches,' the group says in the paper, to be published in Research Notes of the American.\n\nIn the past, a number of other instances of star dimming have been linked to the potential existence of alien life.\n\nIn 2017, researchers investigated where the rapid dimming of Tabby's star might have been caused by an 'alien megastructure.'\n\nIn the end, they determined it was likely caused by microscopic fine dust that scattered the starlight.\n\nLast year, a team of researchers from Harvard and Yale went so far as to suggest the idea of trying to dim our own home star, the sun, as a way of fighting climate change.\n\nUsing a technique called stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), researchers would deliver sulfates into the atmosphere with balloons and high altitude planes.\n\nThe sulfates would theoretically disperse the light from the sun.\n\nThe idea was strictly hypothetical, with an estimated starting cost of $3.5 billion.\n\nAs with a first encounter with alien life, scientists were unsure whether the longterm outcome would be better or worse.\n\nA view of Tabby's Star taken from the Kepler Space Telescope", "description": "New findings from 350 million light years away show a star regularly dimming, a phenomenon that researchers have previously suggested could be caused by 'alien megastructures.'", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19845726-0-image-a-6_1571331111693.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
