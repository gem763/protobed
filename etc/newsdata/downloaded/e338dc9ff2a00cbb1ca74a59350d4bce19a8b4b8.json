Coughing up your last payslip is often enough to convince the powers that be that you\u2019re responsible enough to pay the rent each month, and some landlords even spell out the minimum monthly income they require \u2014 often two, three or even four times the rent.\n\nThat\u2019s all fine and good if you have a regular job and the payslips to prove it. But what do you do if your income is more complex? Maybe you\u2019re a freelancer who juggles a set of regular clients. Maybe you run a small business, or you work seasonally, making most of your income during one part of the year.\n\nWith a little preparation, you can avoid awkward conversations that can place doubts in the minds of property managers.\n\nGather all your documents\n\nWhen your income comes from nontraditional sources, you can never bring too much documentation to a showing.\n\nReddit user sonofaresiii recommends \u201ctaking every shred of paper you can proving your income,\u201d including the following:\n\nTax returns\n\nBank statements for the last three months\n\nAny signed letters from your clients\n\n\u201cAnything you can get your hands on proving your income\u201d\n\nOthers in the same thread recommend having two years\u2019 of tax returns with you, to show income consistency. Yes, you may feel silly walking up with a whole tote bag full of financial documentation. But at least you\u2019ll be prepared.\n\nBe honest, obviously\n\nIn my experience as a self-employed person, landlords don\u2019t really care how you make your money as long as you can prove you make it. I\u2019ve been up front by saying, \u201cI\u2019m self-employed, so I\u2019ve brought two years of tax returns along with three bank statements. I\u2019m happy to provide further documentation if you need it.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a service worker in a touristy spot, or seasonal work is typical in your area, your potential landlord may not even bat an eyelash at your situation. But it\u2019s better to give them a realistic picture of your income rather than leave them guessing.\n\nConsider a guarantor\n\nA guarantor agrees to take over financial responsibility if you for some reason can\u2019t pay your rent. If you\u2019re on the edge of qualifying for an apartment, the landlord may ask for one. They might need to live in the same state as you, depending on the landlord\u2019s rules.\n\nIf you suspect your income history may cause difficulty in securing a place to live, having a potential guarantor in mind could make the process smoother. A family member would be the obvious first pick for this, but a friend may be willing to help as well.\n\nCash always helps\n\nIf you have the cash on hand to pay your security deposit up front in physical dollars, that may be enough to sway the property manager in your favour. Just make sure to get a receipt proving you paid up, since you won\u2019t have a transaction on your bank statement as backup.", "description": "Landlords usually have one big question when you inquire about a rental: Do you have enough money to pay for it?
