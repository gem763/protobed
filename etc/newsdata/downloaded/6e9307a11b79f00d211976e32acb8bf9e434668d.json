The print of 47.4 was below the 48.4 expected and marks the 3rd time in the past 4 months that this metric has disappointed and come in below consensus forecasts. In terms of the market reaction it\u2019s been fairly muted as economic data remains very much of secondary importance for the pound at present, with the markets far more interested in the latest developments on the Brexit front.\n\nBefore the release, the was already sliding lower at the start of what could be a big week for the currency, with the coming days set to reveal how opponents to the government\u2019s Brexit plan will respond. Boris Johnson is clearly pursuing a confrontational approach with the PM threatening to purge any lawmaker in his party that votes against government and the end game is looking increasingly likely to be a so-called \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d General Election. Following the announcement last week of the proroguing of parliament the battle lines have been quite clearly drawn and the emphasis is now very much on the opposition to make their move.\n\nMPs are set to return from their summer recess and the opposition will waste little time in making their move, with the most likely plan being an attempt to pass legislation through parliament that will block a no-deal - similar to the Cooper-Letwin bill earlier this year.
