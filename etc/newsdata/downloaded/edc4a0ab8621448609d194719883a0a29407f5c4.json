Against Scotland they were outclassed from start to finish and never threatened.\n\nAdam Hastings gets the ball rolling for Scotland as he touches down in the first-half\n\nGeorge Horne's quick thinking added a third score when he intercepted to touch down\n\nThe two Glasgow Warriors half-backs celebrate during a convincing first-half display\n\nThey didn\u2019t even score a single point which was all down to their ineptitude in attack rather than Scotland\u2019s defence.\n\nScotland only struggled for the first few minutes when lots of passes didn\u2019t go to hand. Nerves were settled early through two tries in the first twenty minutes by fly-half Adam Hastings. His first came with 15 minutes on the clock when he broke through two tackles to score.\n\nHis second was all his own work.He kicked ahead into acres of space and although Russian full-back Vasily Artemyev looked to have it covered he slipped at the vital moment. Hastings, who had never given up the chase, took full advantage to touch down. It was the perfect start from the fly-half who converted both his tries.\n\nThree minutes later it was George Horne\u2019s chance to take full advantage of a Russian mistake. They won the line-out well but scrum-half Dmitry Perov\u2019s attempted pass was so telegraphed it was picked off by George Horne for an easy score. Hastings converted.\n\nScotland hooker Fraser Brown, who was playing out of position at flanker, was replaced by Magnus Bradbury just before the half-hour mark. It looked like a pre-planned substitution to keep him fresh for the game against Japan.\n\nDarcy Graham carves through the Russian defence after taking the ball out from his own half\n\nHorne touches down once more on his way to a World Cup hat-trick in Shizuoka on Wednesday\n\nGeorge Turner touches down after spinning off the back of a rolling maul to go over\n\nThere was no more scoring in the first half but there was no need to worry. Five minutes after the break winger Darcy Graham ran from deep before unselfishly playing in George Horne to score Scotland\u2019s vital fourth try and gave them the bonus point. Hastings converted. Hooker George Turner got the fifth with Hastings converting yet again.\n\nThe tries kept coming with Seymour get one on 55 minutes following a clever grubber kick from Blair Kinghorn. Hastings kept up his hundred per cent kicking record with the conversion. George Horne got his third try before the hour mark as the Scots started to run riot. He thought he had his fourth but his touchdown in the corner was ruled out for a forward pass.\n\nRussia looked to have run out of puff if John Barclay\u2019s try was anything to go by. He didn\u2019t even have to sprint as he ran past the defence to score under the posts. Hastings put over the conversion.\n\nReplacement Stuart McInally got the ninth try that was converted by Hastings.\n\nThe fly-half thought he had a hat-trick of his own but his touchdown was ruled out by referee Wayne Barnes for another forward pass.\n\nTommy Seymour races through to get on the end of Blair Kinghorn's grubber and touch down", "description": "ROB ROBERTSON IN SHIZUOKA STADIUM ECOPA:Scotland scrum-half George Horne scored a hat-trick as his side easily secured the bonus point win they needed against Russia.", "authors": ["Rob Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483964-0-image-a-2_1570614078398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
