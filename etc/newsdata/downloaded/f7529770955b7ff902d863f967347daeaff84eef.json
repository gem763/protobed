She did not commit the offences she has been charged with, and we are looking forward to challenging the government's allegations at trial.\"\n\nPuerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricane Maria, the catastrophic Category 4 storm that struck in 2017 and left more than 3 million residents without power.\n\nThe wreckage created what is believed to be the longest blackout in US history, contributing to the deaths of thousands who needed access to electricity to run lifesaving equipment such as dialysis machines and breathing devices.\n\nIt took nearly a year to restore power to a majority of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's customers.\n\n\"Corruption in the ranks of DHS and FEMA won't be tolerated,\" said Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph Cuffari.\n\nOfficials poured billions of dollars into repairing the power grid, though even now, officials say, it remains fragile. Tribble arrived in Puerto Rico in October to direct recovery efforts related to the island's bankrupt public utility and the hurricane-ravaged power grid.\n\nThe restoration project was hampered early on by scandal after the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the island's power company, awarded a contract to a little-known, two-person firm out of Montana called Whitefish Energy to rebuild the grid.\n\nAfter that contract was withdrawn, Cobra, a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy, became one of three stateside companies to win federal money to replace transmission towers, erect power poles and restring power lines across Puerto Rico.\n\nNydia Vel\u00e1zquez said the investigation shows that corruption may have been a factor in the slow federal response.\n\n\"If proven,\" Vel\u00e1zquez said in a statement, \"this misuse of funds suggests that, while our fellow citizens on the Island were dying from a lack of electricity, private companies stateside were plotting how to illicitly profit at taxpayers' expense.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that when Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority entered into a 12-month contract with Cobra, FEMA was \"unsound\" in its evaluation of the company's eligibility, and the \"reasonableness\" of the costs estimated for the work were inaccurate, according to a report released in July.\n\nFEMA's analysis of Cobra's labour rates, equipment costs and fees \"were not always logical, complete, and supported,\" the report said. The firm at one point had about 600 people working on the island.\n\nIn a 48-page indictment, federal prosecutors said that Tribble exerted her authority in various ways to ensure Cobra got government work and that local officials accepted the costs Cobra billed.\n\nIn one instance, after an explosion left several municipalities without electricity, prosecutors said, Tribble pressed Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority executives to let Cobra fix the problem even though the executives believed that would increase costs.\n\nThey billed more than $600,000 for the repairs, according to the indictment.\n\nMeanwhile, Tribble reaped the rewards, prosecutors contend. In January 2018, she enquired with Ellison about hotels in New York, and on February 11 she asked for help finding a place to live there and prioritising her needs about location, safety and furnishings.\n\nEllison replied three days later saying \"Yes ma'am, I got it and have somebody on it already,\" according to the indictment. Tribble's note came on the day of the explosion.\n\nMr Leone, Ellison's lawyer, said that a review of Cobra's costs by the Rand Corp. found them to be \"reasonable,\" that multiple officials oversaw all of the work, and that the lucrative contracts were awarded before Ellison met Tribble.\n\nHe said Cobra was \"the only contractor willing to work on credit,\" and while federal officials would sometimes press to get their invoices paid, that was not the result of bribes.\n\n\"People would get involved sometimes to get the bills paid, but to say that that was somehow a result of him trying to help her find a place in New York one time is ridiculous,\" Mr Leone said.\n\nTribble and Ellison communicated on private email and disposable, prepaid cellphones, federal prosecutors said, about work and personal matters. The two were caught on surveillance video gambling together at a Puerto Rico casino, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors said Ellison lied to the FBI and Department of Homeland Security inspector general about the nature of his relationship with Tribble, which he claimed was purely related to work.\n\nTribble has been suspended from FEMA but not terminated, according to a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Puerto Rico. In a statement, a FEMA spokesman said Tribble was \"in a non-duty, non-pay status.\"\n\n\"While we defer to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General on specific questions regarding the indictment, generally employees in that status may not conduct official business on behalf of the federal government,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe agency also said it was \"fully cooperating with federal investigators.\"\n\nPeter Mirijanian, spokesman for Mammoth Energy Services, said: \"Mammoth is aware of and has been cooperating with the government's investigation into Ms. Tribble and Mr. Ellison and will continue to do so.\"\n\nCobra's parent company, Mammoth Energy Services, is an Oklahoma-based oil-field services firm. Forty-nine percent of Mammoth is owned by Wexford Capital, an investment firm in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nNews of Cobra's work for Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority helped drive up the company's stock. It hit a peak of $40.88 a share on June 22, 2018, but the share price has plunged 90 percent since, wiping out more than $1 billion in market value. Analysts following the company slashed price targets in June, citing the completion of Cobra's work.\n\nIn addition to bringing criminal charges, prosecutors moved to seize more than $48 million in several bank accounts under Ellison's name, a 40-foot catamaran, and other vehicles and equipment.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Two Federal Emergency Management Agency\u00a0(FEMA) officials assigned to help manage restoration efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria have been charged with fraud and bribery for allegedly trying to enrich themselves by helping a company that received $1.8 billion in government contracts, the Justice Department announced Tuesday.", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "Steven Mufson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/09/puerto-rico.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
