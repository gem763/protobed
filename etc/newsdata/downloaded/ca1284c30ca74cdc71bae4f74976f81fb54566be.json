That\u2019s down from more than 82,000 in July and a continued reduction from a peak of more than 130,000 apprehensions in May.\n\n\u201cThe President has made it very clear that he is going to use every tool available to him and this administration to address this unprecedented crisis at the southern border,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\n\nThe CBP chief said the administration\u2019s policy to force asylum applicants to remain in Mexico for the duration of their court cases had worked to discourage organized criminals from coordinating illegal crossings.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re telling the cartels and this vulnerable population: the game has changed,\" Morgan proclaimed in the White House briefing room.\n\nMorgan also pointed to action taken by the Mexican government to stem the northern flow of migrants traveling through the country after President Donald Trump threatened trade tariffs earlier in the summer.\n\n\u201cThis is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States,\u201d Trump said on Twitter at the time.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nThroughout the summer months, the Mexican government has ramped up immigration enforcement, ordering 15,000 troops to the country\u2019s northern border. But Morgan said he hopes crossings decline further -- monthly apprehensions in in the months leading up to the fall of 2017 were less than half of the numbers announced Monday.\n\nThe new announcement comes as the administration continues court battles to restrict immigration further. On Monday, a judge in California issued a nation-wide ban on the administration\u2019s latest attempt to restrict asylum applicants traveling through Mexico. The policy had been previously permitted in New Mexico and Texas, but is now suspended until further judicial review.", "description": "The number of migrants found crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has continued to decline in recent weeks.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/border-patrol-apprehension-02-gty-jc-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
