With the advent of distributed energy resources, which is rooftop solar and batteries and energy management systems and smart meters and smart appliances, people will be paying for services. And you can expect your consumer bill to look more like your telco bill, and you\u2019ll choose what level of service and services you want to supply, and also which ones you want to buy.\n\nSo there\u2019s much change coming, and the distribution networks are going to morph from being relatively dumb bits of infrastructure to basically service provision platforms.\n\nNeed for dispatchable investment\n\nThe big change has been the entry of large-scale renewables, and also the exit of ageing coal plants. Now, what\u2019s driven this is two things really. So going forward in terms of market design, one of the things that does make it difficult is the lack of integration of emissions reduction with the energy market. And the world would be much easier if we knew, for example, a national target out at 2050, or some guide of where we\u2019re going. and what we actually have is a lot of state targets and a national target, but they\u2019re all different, and it does mean that designing in the national market gets quite challenging.\n\nBut the big question is how to get firm and flexible dispatchable power. And how best to design to get it. You could design a market which is what we\u2019ve got, where as prices get very high with shortages, you would expect investment to happen, more supply, and everything would then revert back to normal.\n\nThe problem with that approach is that it may not work, or it may not wholly work. And the other problem with it is that consumers in the interim are copping some very large price increases while the investment is both encouraged and then sort of comes.\n\nThe alternative, which happens in some overseas markets, is what\u2019s called a capacity market, and in that sort of market you basically recognised you\u2019ve got a shortage of capacity, and you go into the market and you have an option, and that is how you meet the additional supply you need. It means that your prices aren\u2019t so volatile and they may not go up so much, but there\u2019s also a big danger that you\u2019re going to end up with more capacity than you need, and again that will cost consumers more than perhaps they should have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis debate is something that the Energy Security Board and the Energy Council are going to have to resolve in the very near future. It is often characterised as the market lovers versus people who want to be centralisers. It\u2019s actually more sophisticated than that, and I think in a transition we may find ourselves trying to leave as much room for the market as possible, but needing to step in with some short-term transitional arrangements.\n\nOne of the things that has surprised me personally recently is that the reliability obligation hasn\u2019t been triggered, and a recent study by AEMO found that the reliability standard was being met in all jurisdictions, South Australia and Victoria and NSW. You would think that in South Australia and Victoria it could have been triggered, those markets are very tight, and NSW is also very tight, particularly in summer.\n\nGovernment interventions and investment in Snowy 2.0, and underwriting certain generators ... are not encouraging of investment overall.\n\nEither the reliability standard has been met and is expected to be met over the next few years, or alternatively there\u2019s something awry in AEMO\u2019s rather sophisticated calculations. Either way, where there seems to be particular tightness is over the peak periods in the summer, and that\u2019s something that at the moment in terms of market design we\u2019re paying very close attention to.\n\nProjects such as Snowy 2.0 will be increasingly important in complementing renewables. AAP\n\nIt\u2019s quite difficult at the moment to estimate demand in this market. Cities are becoming more electrified; both Sydney and Melbourne are putting metro systems in which are completely electrified. Electric vehicles are coming, we don\u2019t really know how fast, and it\u2019s clearly going to depend on the cost of new vehicles. So the shape of demand going forward is quite unclear, which doesn\u2019t help very much. And what is happening in the market, in the wholesale market, is a lot of volatility, and that is very good for batteries, encourages batteries to go in, and that\u2019s happening apace.\n\nAnd what is a bit of a problem in the market is the government interventions and investment in Snowy 2.0, and the underwriting of certain generators, all of these things, while perhaps necessary in the short term, are not encouraging of investment overall.\n\nSecurity\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo where Australia is at, in terms of the share of variable renewables, is right up there. In South Australia, we are running at 50 per cent renewables, sometimes more, and the only other countries that are anywhere near that are Ireland and Denmark. And the rest of us, the rest of Australia is much closer to the 20 to 30 per cent range now, and once you get into that sort of range, the need for dispatchable power to complement your renewables becomes increasingly important.\n\nWhat that means is a need for storage. Snowy 2.0 will help, Marinus Link with Tasmania would help, more batteries are going in, and there is also more investment happening in gas peakers. Those things are very important. What is likely to happen going forward with coal plants, which the board worries about, is because they have to basically technically run all the time, they\u2019re basically running many hours of the day and not making any money, because wind and solar\u2019s getting dispatched well ahead of them.\n\nSo they\u2019re going to find it very difficult to be viable over the long term. So some of our coal generators, whatever their age, are going to want to shut down, because they\u2019re just not making any money. And that\u2019s something that really does mean that the demand for flexible and firm power is going to be increasingly great.\n\nWhat not being in voltage limits means among other things is that people\u2019s appliances are going to blow up.\n\nWhile everybody I think is across that sort of issue, the main problem in the market is actually one of security. And this is a graph that\u2019s showed that from about the first quarter in 2017, AEMO has been intervening in the market fairly regularly, and this compares very starkly with what has happened with interventions before, which is they didn\u2019t happen.\n\nNow, the reason for those interventions is not because of short supply, it\u2019s because of security issues. So we\u2019ve got situations in the market where we are not within the limits of frequency that have been set, and nor are we within voltage limits. And what not being in voltage limits means among other things is that people\u2019s appliances are going to blow up.\n\nIn certain places there\u2019ll be more people having trouble with their fridges and other appliances, because of voltage changes. But more importantly the system becomes uncontrollable. And the other problem apart from voltage and frequency is just simply system strength or inertia. And South Australia has had difficulties with that, largely because of the enormous amount of renewables that they have in their system, and particularly solar.\n\nNow, the way that you need to address this in terms of designing the market going forward is to have markets for each of those services, or to have contracts for each of those services. And some of those services are currently provided by large coal plants, who just because of their mechanical characteristics are sitting there and turning turbines around, and lots of metal, and they provide inertia into the system, and allow the system to just ride through shocks that happen from time to time. Without that big plant there we need other things, and it\u2019s those other things that we need markets for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlready we\u2019re running markets for frequency control, and the big Hornsdale battery in South Australia is doing very well providing that service. And the other market sort of is for inertia. And the transmission companies are basically bound to be running their systems with particular levels of inertia, and they are currently putting in equipment called synchronous condensers to control inertia through their systems, and South Australia has recently put in a couple of synchronous condensers to address their inertia issues.\n\nGrid not fit for purpose\n\nWe\u2019ve got a grid at the moment that\u2019s not fit for purpose. And the reason that it\u2019s not fit for purpose is it was developed many decades ago to take power from large coal generators to the cities, and those coal-fired generators are in places like the Latrobe Valley and the Hunter. And news just in \u2013 the new intermittent renewables are not in the Hunter or the Latrobe Valley, they happen to be out in rural areas, and we need to change the grid so we can get from that new generation source to the cities. At the moment what we\u2019ve got in the grid is a very long, skinny string from those generators into town. And Australia is well known for having probably the largest geographic grid in the world, but it\u2019s also the skinniest. And that is really plaguing us at the moment.\n\nA special Australian characteristic ... solar panels on anything that\u2019s flat.\n\nTo address this, AEMO has done an integrated system plan of, among other things, what needs to happen to the grid. At the moment, the investments that are going on are basically no regrets, and frankly not extraordinarily expensive investments in the grid scheme of things. But we\u2019re upgrading the interconnect with Queensland, upgrading the interconnect between NSW and Victoria, putting the synchronous condensers in South Australia as I\u2019ve just mentioned, and increasing the link in Victoria out to the north west to connect to a lot of renewable energy out there.\n\nThe next integrated system plan is due out by the end of this year, and again I would anticipate that having got those projects under way, we\u2019ll have another stream of projects to commence. And all of that is fine, but the investment in all of these things will find their way onto customer bills. And it\u2019s fair to say that the consumer groups are extremely concerned about what this may mean, so what we need to be very careful about is not going too fast, but going fast enough.\n\nAnd it is quite an urgent issue to get the transmission grid right, because we\u2019ve got renewable energy plants going in that are having trouble connecting into the grid because of congestion.\n\nAustralia leads world in rooftop solar\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final thing I want to talk about is where Australia, through no great fault of its own really, is leading the world. There\u2019s a special Australian characteristic, which is solar panels on roofs. And on warehouse roofs and on anything that\u2019s flat, we\u2019ve got solar panels.\n\nIn Adelaide and in Brisbane, and also in Perth \u2013 which doesn\u2019t happen to be part of the national electricity market, but it does have plenty of solar panels \u2013 over 30 per cent of homes now have solar panels. And in the last year, as they went in, every one in eight of them had a battery. And if you\u2019ve got a battery that can be connected into the system, you\u2019ve got the opportunity to be able to export power as well as import power into your business or home.\n\nSo the distribution companies, the Ausgrids of the world, are not typically the most agile companies in the world, and they are now coping with bidirectional flows, or trying to cope with them. They\u2019ve also got customers who can, if they save demand, want to be able to basically offer demand savings to the operator instead of power.\n\nThere are also people called aggregators running around doing retail type things by aggregating things like all the pool pumps on the north shore [of Sydney], and putting them on and off at particular times to suit the operator, which in turn saves energy when it needs to be saved. All of these sorts of services are possible to be offered, and basically the distribution networks are turning into trading platforms.\n\nWe\u2019re actually at a stage where we don\u2019t even know where this equipment is, let along have it uniformly specified.\n\nBut what\u2019s happening during the day in Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide, is that in the middle of the day the demand for power from the grid is effectively zero, or very close to it. So you have a situation where the demand that you\u2019re looking at from the grid is normal, and then at about 10 or 11am it falls drastically, and it stays down near the zero level until three or four, and then it jumps back up to what\u2019s normal again.\n\nAnd this so-called duck curve of demand is really creating security issues for the distribution networks. What needs to happen is the distribution networks have got a lot of technical things to cope with. All the equipment going in needs to have technical specs so that the operator can basically co-ordinate things.\n\nWe\u2019re actually at a stage where we don\u2019t even know where this equipment is, let along have it uniformly specified so that an aggregator or the operator can use it to control demand and supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the moment, the networks are regulated on a building-block approach, and they get a set regulated rate of return. That sort of model does not fit this world. What is going to happen with the distribution networks, and what must happen, is the regulator will need to, they are monopolies, they need to be regulated, but they\u2019re now going to be providing services, so there needs to be a move to regulation about the cost of services that they\u2019re providing.\n\nAnd we need to be very careful going forward that as our cities grow the distribution networks don\u2019t just blindly keep building out networks and more physical equipment than they need to. With this sort of technology, there\u2019s a chance to save a lot of money in these networks, if we get the incentives right.\n\nSo at the moment, the regulators actually constrain what the distribution companies can do quite severely, and I think that that\u2019s likely to alter. And the role of the retailers at the moment is likely to change. And if I was a big retailer, I\u2019d be really quite concerned about what my business model was like going forward. I\u2019m in a world where my customers don\u2019t like me, and I have been offering very opaque bills, and very difficult to understand bills, bills that are almost meant to be confusing, and bills that have made offers that were basically well over what they needed to be. So not surprisingly, customers are very browned off with the existing retailers.\n\nNipping at their heels\n\nThere are new retailers entering the system offering many different services of the kind that I\u2019ve just mentioned. And the big retailers need to be mindful of the competition that\u2019s at the moment doing nothing more than nipping at their heels. But it\u2019s there, and it\u2019s based on software and IT matters, and it\u2019s likely to get much more intense, so long as the regulator permits. And if the distribution companies start getting into this act, the retailers are going to get very challenged, I think.\n\nSo the other thing that I\u2019ll mention just on rooftop solar before I leave it, there\u2019s no other country in the world that\u2019s anywhere near our rooftop solar penetration, and it\u2019s fair to say everybody is watching us with great interest about how we manage this.", "description": "The world is watching as Australia leads the world in rooftop solar, but the pressure is on to get energy security and reliability right, says Kerry Schott.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2687%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_374%2C$y_51/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7a2b1de0a2fef589996f01cb31724e02db7b9cd5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
