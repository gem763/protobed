But these attacks are not fringe affairs confined to internet hinterlands; they are designed to propel anti-LGBTQ talking points into the mainstream. During the height of Pride, right-wing commentator Laura Ingraham told her podcast listeners that Drag Queen Story Hour is \u201cthe left\u2019s new cultural warpath to gender bend our kids into submission.\u201d\n\nA group called MassResistance has been leading the charge against Drag Queen Story Hour. It was founded in 1995 by Massachusetts\u2019 Brian Camenker to challenge \u201chomosexual activism in the schools\u201d\u2014like gay-straight alliances and the national advocacy group Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network. Back in 2000, Camenker\u2019s group illegally recorded LGBT youth groups and distributed the tapes in an attempt to defund the state\u2019s Governor\u2019s Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth. Just a few years later, Camenker was likening gay people to Nazis and anti-gay activists to persecuted Jewish people.\n\nThe head of MassResistance\u2019s California chapter, Arthur Schaper, appeared on Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show in June. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about diversity here, we\u2019re talking about deviance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about perverse and destructive lifestyles being animated, or advertised, to children, as if it\u2019s normal.\u201d In July, he backed the vice mayor of Dixon, California, in demanding the town designate a \u201cstraight pride\u201d month\u2014a move that has inspired at least one white nationalist \u201ctraditionalist\u201d to publicly join the group. That the Southern Poverty Law Center had designated MassResistance an anti-LGBT hate group, the man said in a video, only made him want to sign up more.\n\nThe more traditional, mediagenic anti-LGBTQ messages about \u201cprotecting the children\u201d are now fully interwoven with the white nationalist agenda of racial purity. It\u2019s been a long time coming. In 1995, I co-founded my Massachusetts high school\u2019s gay-straight alliance with support from the governor\u2019s commission and one straight guidance counselor. I wasn\u2019t aware of Camenker at the time. But in the 1990s, hostile students were already hurling the idea of \u201cstraight pride\u201d as a protest against the alliance and those who identified as anything but straight. The governor\u2019s commission documented this tactic way back in a 1993 report\u2014of which MassResistance keeps a copy on its website.\n\nAs the visibility of LGBTQ people has grown, so has the hostility\u2014especially so amid the rise of alt-right, men\u2019s rights, white supremacist, and other groups in the age of Trump. And more and more, the state is enabling them. In arraignments in Boston on Tuesday morning, prosecutors asked that the disorderly conduct charges against the protesters be dropped, but the judges repeatedly refused. The justice system, from the cops to the courts, has become a useful tool for right-wing extremists to spread fear among LGBTQ people and to punish those who oppose their \u201cstraight\u201d agenda.", "description": "Attacks on LGBTQ people are on the rise across the country.
