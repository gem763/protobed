About 700 million people live in extreme poverty worldwide, and the prize committee said the winners' research could be an important tool in tackling it.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences gave the shared award on Monday to Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo of MIT and Michael Kremer of Harvard, noting that their collective research has led to remedial teaching programs for 5 million Indian children and subsidized preventive-healthcare programs in developing countries.\n\nBanerjee and Duflo, who are married, have produced many research papers and two books together, including the highly praised 2011 book \"Poor Economics,\" and their work is complementary to Kremer's. The three, who have also collaborated, brought a radical new approach to developmental economics. They have proven the effectiveness of taking an experimental approach typically seen in clinical trials, utilizing randomized control trials.\n\nFor the past three decades, they have shown the effectiveness of reducing large-scale poverty in countries like India and Kenya by seeing the problem as a holistic one with many parts tied to access to education and healthcare from childhood.\n\nThe best introduction to this approach is \"Poor Economics,\" but we've compiled some further reading, as well as a short talk from each winner that you can watch.", "description": "Newly appointed Nobel laureates Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer have changed the way we study and fight extreme poverty.", "authors": ["Richard Feloni"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4da264af9092f154ab5fd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
