But he suddenly began losing weight.\n\n\"I lost about 12 pounds in a week,\" Trebek said. \"And my numbers went sky high, much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed. So, the doctors have decided that I have to undergo chemo again, and that's what I'm doing.\"\n\nHe told People magazine in May he was \"near remission,\" according to his doctors.\n\n\"It's kind of mind-boggling,\" Trebek said then. \"The doctors said they hadn't seen this kind of positive result in their memory ... some of the tumors have already shrunk by more than 50 percent.\"\n\nTrebek recently returned to work and talked to \"GMA\" about the toll the disease, including pain, fatigue and depression.\n\n\"Early on, I was down on myself. I didn't realize how fallible each of us is in his or her own way,\" he said. \"I talk to the audience sometimes and I get teary-eyed for no reason. I don't even bother to explain it anymore.
