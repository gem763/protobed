I\u2019m a single mother on a small income, with two children conceived and born after their father died, courtesy of IVF. I just cannot afford to keep up with the Joneses or the Bentley-Coopers. Hence the extreme anxiety I\u2019m having over my toddler\u2019s third birthday party.\n\nI was thinking of having a few of her nursery school mates over for a Paw Patrol-themed play date. And I\u2019d already made provision to decamp the ravenous Golden Retriever to a friend\u2019s house, to stop him getting to the birthday cake before Lola and her friends.\n\nBut when one mother asked me who the event planner was, I was thrown into a tailspin. I thought I\u2019d pushed the boat out by ordering Paw Patrol cups, plates and a pink plastic table cloth \u2013 even a helium gas canister for the balloons. At first, I thought she was joking, until she told me that for her son\u2019s birthday she had taken some of his classmates on a skiing trip to Zermatt.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnother mum, whose son we were inviting, told me she had hired a whole nightclub, with a live band, and released a downpour of inflatable guitars on to the children below, from a huge ceiling net. At another party in Holland Park, they had a live orchestra performing Peter and the Wolf to totally uninterested four-year-olds. I\u2019ve even heard of party invitations inscribed on solid silver for you to keep.\n\nThen to totally finish me off, a mum at Kensington Monkey Music class told me her child went to party in a suite at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, in Knightsbridge, with a separate suite for prams and nannies to hang out in.\n\nMy two-bedroom flat as the venue \u2013 and the idea of a Paw Patrol-themed pass-the-parcel game \u2013 feels like it won\u2019t be nearly good enough. But I have to keep reminding myself that this is what Lola wants. Even if I offered her a weekend at Disney Paris she would still prefer to dance with her friends in my sitting room to Peppa Pig\u2019s The Bing Bong song.\n\nBut I keep having flashbacks of being invited last year to two-year-old Astrid\u2019s party at a local Kensington venue. It was a rave theme, with peace signs everywhere and kids wearing French clothes from local boutiques Bonpoint and Bonton, who were dancing on glass tables to rap music.\n\nI thought she was joking, until she told me that for her son\u2019s birthday she had taken some of his classmates on a skiing trip to Zermatt\n\nI\u2019m in the grip of an identity crisis. Around here parents will spend more money on their pooch\u2019s party than I will on Lola\u2019s. I start to panic and search online for a Paw Patrol bouncy castle, which at least will cover the dog poo-infested garden and provide a more dramatic backdrop. But when it\u2019s delivered by a half-wit with dirt all over his boots, which he treads all over my clean floor hours before the party, I start screaming at the kids to be quiet and let me clean the place, which I do with the intensity of somebody escaping a plane crash.\n\nIt must be added that the party was a great success. The M&S food went down well with everybody, except Lola\u2019s friend\u2019s dad, who owns London\u2019s poshest greengrocer Natoora. He wouldn\u2019t touch it with a barge pole \u2013 but then all his fruit and veg, carefully sourced and only sold in season, arrives in such a rugged state, it looks straight out of a field.\n\nIt\u2019s really taking clean-eating in my area to a whole new level.", "description": "Nothing compares to former Kensington and Chelsea\u00a0resident Meghan Markle\u2019s baby shower \u2013\u00a0which\u00a0apparently cost $200,000 \u2013\u00a0but some of the birthday parties my yummy-mummy neighbours hold for\u00a0their little ones are bigger than most people\u2019s weddings.
