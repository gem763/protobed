So when I turned around, he was down on the ground and the first thing that I knew was like 'Man, let's just go and pray' because this is such a dangerous game.\"\n\nThe Times-Picayune reported on Sunday that Davis was fined $28,075 for unnecessary roughness for the play during the fourth quarter of the Week 6 game between the Saints and the Jaguars. Swaim suffered a concussion and was not cleared to play against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 7 of the NFL schedule.\n\nDEMARIO DAVIS: I WAS PUT IN A CONFLICTING POSITION\n\nDavis spoke to Arroyo in an exclusive Fox Nation interview before the NFL announced the fine.\n\n\"I wanted personally to take time and pray for him because... my prayers and thoughts are still with him,\" he told Fox Nation. \"Hopefully, he's going to be fully recovered from that because it's such a fast game and so much is happening so fast. And you go from a play that... you feel like it's about to be a normal tackle and then boom!\"\n\n\"At that point it's like, God needs to heal this man up, make sure he's good,\" Davis continued. \"But he was able to walk off the field, which was huge. And I'm definitely wishing him well and speedy recovery.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST STORIES FROM FOX NATION\n\nOn \"Fox and Friends\" on Sunday, Arroyo observed that this is not the first fine for Davis over the past few weeks.\n\nThe NFL penalized Davis in September after he was shown wearing a headband with the phrase \"Man of God\" written on it. The headband had apparently violated the NFL's policy against displaying personal messages.\n\nTV viewers saw the headband after Davis took off his helmet off to deliver a pre-game pep talk to his teammates, filling the void left behind by Saint's captain and quarterback Drew Brees, who is sidelined with a thumb injury.\n\nDavis told Fox Nation that he did not fault the NFL for the fine, which the league eventually rescinded, but he did want to capitalize on the moment.\n\nNEW ORLEANS SAINTS' DEMARIO DAVIS WON'T BE FINED FOR MAN OF GOD HEADBAND\n\n\"I was like, well, it would be proper for me to be obedient and follow the rule and so I did that,\" recalled Davis. \"But then I said, you know, God\u2019s going to get glory from this headband, whether I wear it or not... And all of a sudden, you know, me and my team, we came up with the idea of marketing the headbands and using them for donations.\"\n\nThrough the sale of the \"Man of God\" headbands, Davis was able to raise $120,000 for a local Mississippi hospital through the proceeds and matching donations.\n\n\"Demario Davis though he has only been on this team for under two years, he stepped into the leadership void,\" said Arroyo. \"I love this story about the headband. He wore it under his helmet, so he didn't realize that it was a fineable offense. The NFL saw it during that huddle talk, fined him and he turned it into something good.\"\n\nFinally, reflecting on Swaim's injury, Davis said that all NFL players recognize that there are no \"winners\" when a player is injured.\n\n\"We all know that any of us can be in that situation at any moment, and none of us want to inflict that or be on the receiving end of that,\" he said. \"And so it's like it's not a cause for celebration. Nobody wins that play. Offense doesn't win. Defense doesn't win. It's like it'd be better if that played never happened.\"\n\nTo watch the full interview featuring Demario Davis, including more of these thoughts on his collision with Jaguars tight end Geoff Swaim, join Fox Nation and watch the latest episode of \"Laura and Raymond.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
