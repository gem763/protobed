Before that, he served three years as a probationary firefighter, according to New York Daily News. He had also served as chief of the Roslyn Heights Highlands volunteer fire department before he became an official New York City firefighter based just north of Times Square.\n\n[The photo of the doomed 9/11 \u2018Dust Lady\u2019 still haunts us after all these years]\n\nHe had received the call about the attacks just as he was wrapping up his shift, according to Newsday.\n\nHaub was survived by his wife, Erika, and their son and daughter, who were 3 years old and 16 months when he died. His daughter first said \u201cDada\u201d on the day of his death, according to Daily News.\n\nIdentifying remains of the dead from the Sept. 11 attacks is ongoing. In July, the New York City medical examiner identified its 1,644th victim, according NBC New York. It was the second identification of the year, as a man\u2019s identity was also confirmed in June. The name of the woman identified in July was withheld from the public at her family\u2019s request.\n\n\n\nNew York City Fire Department members attend a second service for FDNY firefighter Michael Haub in Franklin Square, N.Y.

Their names will go on the World Trade Center memorial wall at the Brooklyn-based FDNY headquarters, according to CNN.\n\nFire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told CNN that wall is a reminder of all the sacrifice that the responders showed in the aftermath of the attacks.\n\nErika, Haub\u2019s wife, has since remarried.\n\nIn 2011, she told Newsday that she would always love her husband even though others commented that she had \u201cmoved on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not moving on, it\u2019s living,\u201d she said to Newsday on the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. \u201cWe\u2019re here to live, not to die, so I enjoy my life; but it\u2019s very painful, especially raising two children who lost their father, especially in that way.\u201d\n\n\n\nFirefighter Michael Haub is remembered on the eve of the 18th anniversary of 9/11.
