Following his death, authorities informed his mother that her son had suffered a myocardial infarction as a result of an undiagnosed heart condition. They added that doctors were unable to revive him when he was taken to a nearby hospital.\n\nAs part of the cover-up, family members who went to see Ghalipjan at the hospital found him with a defibrillator attached to his chest, although authorities reportedly blocked them from inspecting his corpse, according to sources who spoke with the agency.\n\nHowever, one local neighbor, who chose to remain anonymous, told RFA that he was killed by an inebriated officer \u201cfrom the Labai Square Police Station\u201d at the camp where he was held.\n\n\u201cHe was beaten to death \u2026 [by] a police officer,\u201d the man told the agency. \u201cThe officer came to work after drinking alcohol and beat him without any reason.\u201d\n\nChinese Communist Party sources also told RFA that officers oversaw Ghalipjan\u2019s burial hours after his death, and consequently denied relatives the right to wash his body in accordance with Muslim funeral practices.\n\nWhen asked if the assailant was still working with the police, the committee chief confirmed that he had been sent to prison, but did not have any further information other than that he was an ethnic Han Chinese who had been temporarily assigned to Ghalipjan\u2019s camp.\n\nSince 2017, Chinese authorities have imprisoned approximately one million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities across Xinjiang. They have placed the majority in concentration camps designed to indoctrinate them into the ideals of Chinese nationalism and communist ideology, forcing them to disavow their allegiance to Islam, engaging in slave labor, receiving forced sterilization or birth control, and, some reports suggest, being used as live organ donors.\n\nBeijing has repeatedly denied allegations that the camps are intended as a repressive apparatus, insisting they are instead \u201cvoluntary de-radicalization camps\u201d and \u201cvocational training centers\u201d intended to improve integration between ethnic minorities and wider Chinese society. They also claim the camps are a necessary measure to prevent terrorism following various Islamist inspired attacks over the past decades.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "A young Uyghur man who authorities claimed had suffered a fatal heart attack was actually attacked by a police officer in a drunken rage.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/02/chinese-security-mosque-Xinjiang-china-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
