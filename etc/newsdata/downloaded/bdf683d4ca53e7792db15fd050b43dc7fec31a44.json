According to reports, Trump did not consult either the State or Defense Departments before taking the decision.\n\nKurdish fighters have been the strongest U.S. ally taking on ISIS in Syria, but Ankara considers them to be in league with Kurdish groups operating within Turkey. The Turks have been trying to get the U.S. to leave northeast Syria (which borders Turkey) for months; they finally succeeded this week, and wasted little time launching their offensive.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nWhen it comes to Syria, it is always useful to explain who is fighting whom, and for what reason. To wit, here is a (very much) simplified state of play of what\u2019s going on in Syria in October 2019.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nSyrian strongman Bashar Assad has won Syria\u2019s civil war, as his forces have recaptured much of Syria\u2019s land. He\u2019s now back in Damascus\u2014a feat only accomplished with the backing of Russia and Iran\u2014both of whom are looking to use Syria to expand their influence in the region. Turkey is no fan of Assad by any means, but their biggest enemy in Syria\u2019s civil war are the Kurds, whom Turkey is worried will use the territory they\u2019ve captured to establish an independent Kurdish state, which has long been the dream of the region\u2019s 25 to 35 million Kurds, roughly 15 million of whom reside in Turkey. The U.S. (along with a broader coalition of Western countries) got involved in Syria under Barack Obama to fight back against ISIS\u2014whose \u201ccaliphate\u201d stretched across territory in both Iraq and Syria\u2014but was always wary about putting too many boots on the ground, forcing it to work with whoever was most aligned with that mission while also not being a brutal dictator (Assad) or perennial enemy of the US (Russia/Iran). That happened to be Kurdish rebel forces.\n\nToday, ISIS has lost virtually all the land it controlled at the height of its power. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been 100% defeated, though Trump maintains that it has. Nearly 10,000 ISIS fighters from Iraq and Syria are being detained in Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) jails, and as many as 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters.\n\nTrump feels that now that ISIS is no longer an immediate threat, he can begin to remove U.S. troops from the country and make good on one of his central campaign promises to bring U.S. troops home. But that also means allowing Turkey to come in and launch an offensive against a group of people that up until last week were US allies. It\u2019s a controversial move\u2014when Trump tried to remove U.S. troops from Syria last year, it prompted the resignation of US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. But Trump is now desperate for political wins as impeachment hearings bare down. The backlash in the U.S. has been swift, and uncharacteristically bipartisan.\n\nThere are three main concerns that both Democrats and Republicans share over the move. The first is the precedent this sets for how America treats its allies; if this is how the Kurds are rewarded for being loyal partners to the US, who would willingly sign up to work with the Americans going forward? The second, and most immediate, concern is what happens to those ISIS fighters being kept in Kurdish-controlled jails\u2014as more Kurds will be needed to fight over the Turkish offensive, the worry is that those jailed-ISIS fighters will have an easier time escaping, and potentially resuscitating an ISIS network that was gasping its last breaths. Third, is that the removal of US troops in Northeast Syria will eventually give way to the removal of the rest of US troops from the country (roughly 1,000 of whom are left), allowing Russia or Iran more influence, and ultimately resulting in a US. with less clout in the Middle East and more enemies.\n\nWhat Happens Next:\n\nTurkey wasted little time launching its offensive. When dealing with a world leader as mercurial as Trump, you have to move fast\u2014just because you have an agreement with him on Sunday doesn\u2019t mean it will remain in place till Friday, especially as the domestic political repercussions of those decisions start surfacing. Since Trump announced the move, he has been busy tweeting, which included threats towards Turkey to remain within \u201climits\u201d, a clear sign that he is feeling the political heat back home. But at this point, facts on the ground have progressed too much for him to backtrack. Congress will attempt to impose sanctions on Turkey to arrest their progress, but they\u2019re unlikely to make a difference.\n\nFor Erdogan, this military campaign is a chance for him to boost his flailing domestic approval ratings as he goes after Kurds, a reliable enemy for Turkish politicians. But there is not much long-term strategy behind the risky move\u2014he could end up stuck there for months or years, hemorrhaging money and military resources. And all this assumes that ISIS isn\u2019t revived, for which the US will now hold Turkey accountable\u2014just this week, the White House released a statement saying \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial \u2018Caliphate\u2019 by the United States.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s move into northeast Syria doesn\u2019t just have to do with Kurds, though. Turkey is currently hosting approximately 3.6 million Syrian refugees (and getting paid $6.7 billion by the EU to do so), but their stay is increasingly unwelcome, especially as the Turkish economy is struggling. Erdogan has promised to relocate at least a million Syrian refugees across the border with the offensive, but that\u2019s not very realistic\u2014Turkey won\u2019t be able to capture enough land, few refugees actually want to go back to an active warzone, and Turkey will face tremendous international blowback if it starts relocating Syrian refugees against their will.\n\nAs for the Kurds, they have already begun reaching out to other potential allies. Fighting ISIS is no longer their priority\u2014survival is, and they know it\u2019s impossible for them to repel Turkey without U.S. backing, and will accordingly pick their spots in engaging the Turks. To that end, they have already started looking to Moscow to possibly broker any kind of short-term agreement with Assad. Assad is wary of Turkey moving into Syrian territory he wants himself, and Moscow doesn\u2019t want Turkey to be too successful lest it lead to a protracted military confrontation, jeopardizing the peace talks Moscow is busy trying to broker. But any agreement between the Kurds, Assad and Moscow will be short-lived as Assad and Moscow want that territory for Syria in the end, and Kurds still want their own homeland.\n\nThe One Major Misconception About it:\n\nThat the US has begun its inexorable march out of northeast Syria. There are three situations that could draw the US back into the region. First, if Turkish-Kurdish fighting spins out of control, resulting in significant Kurdish casualties that forces the US to step back in. The second is if there are any US casualties among the remaining forces on the ground in Syria. And third is if the fighting there is drawn out over months and U.S. public opinion comes to match current congressional outrage.\n\nAll of which is to say\u2014Erdogan has to tread carefully, but not so carefully that this takes months or years to resolve. It\u2019s a fine needle to thread.\n\nThe One Thing to Say About It at a Dinner Party:\n\nTrump may have been doing this to score a victory with his political base as impeachment looms\u2026 but in the process ticked off the one group of people\u2014congressional Republicans\u2014he needs to stay in office. If this move really blows up in his face\u2014if there is an uptick in U.S. casualties or ISIS suddenly resurges\u2014it may be enough to cause some GOP senators to turn on him.\n\nThis is the problem with being all short-term tactics and no long-term strategy.\n\nThe One Thing to Avoid Saying About It:\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces, led by Kurds, called Washington\u2019s move \u201ca stab in the back.\u201d Because what the US really needed right now was another group of heavily armed Middle Easterners steeped in warfare ticked off at them.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "What happens next in Syria with Turkey's invasion against the Kurds?
