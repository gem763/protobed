An analysis of the numbers collected by computer software using the \u201cGD-IQ\u201d \u2014 Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient \u2014 revealed that women last year reached on-screen parity in the 50 most popular children\u2019s programs.\n\nAccording to an analysis of characters in those television programs, women accounted for 52% of lead or co-lead roles, The Washington Post reported. Women also accounted for just over half (50.3%) of speaking time, and 55.3% of on-screen time, according to the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media at Mount St. Mary\u2019s University in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI was ecstatic,\u201d Davis told the Post. \u201cThe goal from the very beginning was gender balance in what kids see on screen ... it\u2019s exactly what I hoped for.\u201d\n\nDavis said she was \u201cstunned\u201d to discover how poorly females were represented when she started watching preschool TV with her 2-year-old daughter 15 years ago. \u201cThe Teletubbies are actually gender-balanced,\u201d she quipped, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if you can tell.\u201d\n\nWith the help of a Google grant in 2012, University of Southern California engineers and a member of the Geena Davis Institute developed software to tote up the number of women in programs based on facial and voice recognition. The software can determine the number of women relative to men, as well as their amount of screen and speaking time in film, TV programs and ads.\n\nThe GD-IQ tool can also recognize race, but gender nonconforming roles have to be measured manually.\n\nDavis said there\u2019s still work to be done boosting the number of supporting female characters. And girls and women still tend to be hyper-sexualized on screen \u2014 and are consistently less funny.\n\nDavis doesn\u2019t believe there are enough \u201creal-life women role models to inspire change in our culture, so we need them in fiction,\u201d she told the Post. The good news is, as much as media images \u201ccan cause problems ... they can [also] be the cure for the problems they\u2019re creating,\u201d she added.", "description": "Women last year grabbed half of the leading roles in the top 50 children's programs, according to a Geena Davis Institute analysis.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d84688c2300003100cf4cba.jpeg?cache=gtnrcksl3m&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
