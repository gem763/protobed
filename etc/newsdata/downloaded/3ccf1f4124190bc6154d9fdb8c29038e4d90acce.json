But a number of presidential hopefuls have yet to meet the thresholds to qualify for the debate, meaning there could be a smaller group of candidates to take the stage as the Democratic primary race enters the final months of the year.\n\nIn September, the DNC announced a new set of higher polling and donor thresholds candidates must reach to participate in the November debate. To qualify, contenders will have two possible ways to meet the polling requirement. They can either reach three percent in four national or early state, DNC-approved polls for five percent in two early state polls. This is a higher bar to clear than the two percent polling requirement that was used for the September and October debates.\n\nAdditionally, candidates need to also demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors including at least 600 per state in at least 20 states, U.S. territories, or the District of Columbia. This is an increase from the 130,000 donor threshold used for the third and fourth debates.\n\nCandidates will have until November 13 at 11:59 pm to meet both polling and donor requirements. But according to an analysis by CBS News, only eight candidates have met both thresholds to participate in the November debate so far. They include:\n\nJoe Biden\n\nCory Booker\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nKamala Harris\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n\n\nTom Steyer\n\n\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\n\n\nAndrew Yang\n\n\n\nThe venue, format and moderators for the November debate will be announced at a future date. It will be hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post.\n\n\n\nPrior to the November debate, twelve candidates are set to take the stage for the fourth debate in October. That debate will take place at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio on October 15. Previous debate also took place in Miami, Detroit and Houston.", "description": "The Democratic National Committee announced its fifth presidential debate will be held in Georgia in November", "authors": ["Sarah Ewall-Wice"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/13/18992c93-7320-4e0a-9a5a-08e7e76ff30d/thumbnail/1200x630/cb5ae2e02be54363f2f6eca4c8972f25/gettyimages-1167620736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
