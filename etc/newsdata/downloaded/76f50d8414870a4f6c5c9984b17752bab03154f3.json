My mood changes and my interest changes. I\u2019ve been able to live around the world\u2014 and there are moments where I want to live in Paris, and when I want a glass box in the North Fork (Long Island), or a townhouse in the West Village.\n\nMore: New York Real Estate Investor and Developer Says Despite Challenges, Manhattan\u2019s Market is Still a Leader\n\nMG: Do you have a real estate property that got away?\n\nJR: There are a number of them. There are two in Park Slope [Brooklyn] alone. For one, they did a best and final and we lost it. To compound the weirdness, we were bidding against [actor] Paul Dano. Just going room to room with that guy felt weird.\n\n\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nJR: To me, luxury seems to tap into all of our senses. It\u2019s also about simplicity, and creating a calming experience.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s the biggest surprise in the luxury real estate market now?\n\nJR: In the luxury market, there seems to be a battle of amenities. I was in a project meeting recently and they were talking about a hot tub with a synthetic beach, and an outdoor pizza oven. The effort to differentiate goes to an extreme.\n\nMore: Designer Andre Fu Says a Home Should Reflect Its Neighborhood\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nJR: My partner and I went on a trip to Dubai recently and we saw the idea of luxury being created out of nothing, and it made me think about what it means to be luxury. There\u2019s an element of authenticity that needs to be there. To me, there was something that seemed inauthentic and too contrived in Dubai.\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re talking about hubs of luxury, it\u2019s about more than just the place, it\u2019s a combination of a beautiful setting, amazing access to culture, the vitality of institutions. There are cultural capitals around the world\u2014New York, London and Paris\u2014 and the hubs will remain in those places.\n\n\n\nMG: Where are the best luxury homes in the world and why?\n\nJR: Those places, and also L.A., because it has those outdoor spaces and beautiful vistas. All those places tend to attract the best designers, and there\u2019s something to be said about the quality of design that makes it luxurious. When you have great designers in great cities, it\u2019s hard to beat that.\n\nFrom Penta: Anthony Bourdain\u2019s Personal Property Hits Auction\n\nMG: What\u2019s your favorite part of your home?\n\nJR: By far, our kitchen. We bought a townhouse in Park Slope), and it\u2019s a south-facing rear yard, and we blew out the back of the house, and have glass doors and right behind that, we have a farm table, and that\u2019s naturally become the center of the home. It\u2019s a place of physical and spiritual nourishment. Our friends come over and we have martinis or whiskeys there, and we put a lot of time into the garden, and we grow vegetables out there with our kids.\n\n\n\nMG: What best describes the theme to your home and why?\n\nJR: I love the speed of New York, and I\u2019ve been here for 15 years, but I\u2019m getting older. This is a respite. We have skylights throughout, and a lot of natural light, we hardly ever have lights on, and we have big windows facing the garden. It\u2019s a place of health and wellbeing, and taking it down a notch. It\u2019s about self-preservation.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable thing in your home?\n\nJR: My wife is a jewelry designer, and she makes a lot of custom pieces. She used to work for Mimi So.\n\nMore: Holistic Wellness is the Perk Buyers Really Want, Says NYC Brokerage Chief\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable amenity to have in your home right now?\n\nJR: It depends on the place, but in New York it\u2019s outdoor space in any variety. That\u2019s something we pay a lot of attention to in our projects\u2014 at 280 St. Marks [in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn], each unit had a loggia, terrace or yard.\n\n\n\nOn 71st, there\u2019s a large roof garden, and that was a tremendous amenity for people.\n\n\n\nThinking about amenities for the future, my partner and I both teach at Virginia Tech, and we\u2019re working on a modular construction that monitors health and wellbeing, and that information could be shared with a physician. I think it\u2019s the next-gen of a game-changing amenity. By this major, we could age in place. Like a smart home that had technologies that could help you age in place. Also, we think it could be built into modular construction, offsite, avoid labor costs of New York City by plugging in these modules, so you can balance the costs.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s your best piece of real estate advice?\n\nJR: Other than don\u2019t be afraid of Paul Dano when you look at properties, look past the superficial and see the inherent value. You need to look past the craziness. There are options even in New York. You have to go in with an open mind. Look past what everyone else is doing.\n\nMore: Even Agents Are Surprised at the Deals They\u2019re Seeing in the Luxury Market, Says NYC Broker\n\nMG: What\u2019s the best area for investing in luxury properties?\n\nJR: Luxury is equal part location and great design. I think there are opportunities.\n\n\n\nMG: What\u2019s going on in the news that will have the biggest impact on the luxury real estate market?\n\nJR: Changes in hotel property rules and tenant-landlord rent regulation, which seem to be increasing rental prices. I\u2019m just trying to get my head around all this. We started our practice doing high-end condo projects, then shifted to rentals because that\u2019s where the market went. Now there\u2019s been a political intervention that\u2019s gonna change the market. We\u2019re all trying to assess the landscape.\n\n\n\nMG: If you had a choice of living in a new development or a prime resale property, which would you choose and why?\n\nJR: It comes down to the merits of each one. We try to find value in a site and the location. I wouldn\u2019t lean one way or the other until I visited these places. Some of the current development is extraordinary because of some of those amenities, but it\u2019s also appealing to have your own home and not to worry about maintenance fees. But it really comes down to design, feeling and location.\n\nClick to Read More Luxury Real Estate Professionals Share Their Insights\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-108323?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
