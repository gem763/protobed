(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nRecently, I covered Jerry Nadler\u2019s House Judiciary Committee passing rules for an \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d As some of us have speculated for months now, this was simply an attempt at stealth impeachment, i.e. getting to use the benefits of impeachment (grand jury access, increased subpoena power, etc.) without having too actually pass articles of impeachment.\n\nThe game in this case is that Nadler wants to pretend he\u2019s emperor with no guidelines while not having to pay the political price of having House Democrats actually vote as a majority to impeach. There\u2019s noway the courts should allow that and it would present an enormously dangerous precedent if allowed to proceed.\n\nNow, the DOJ is striking back, signaling they aren\u2019t going to take this nonsense lying down.\n\nThey also note that Nadler himself insisted as recently as late July that his committee was not conducting an impeahcment inquiry because of the various possible outcomes. pic.twitter.com/oRrDDq3SvU \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) September 13, 2019\n\nDOJ also notes that the Judiciary Committee initially said the grand jury material was crucial so it could interview McGahn effectively. But then Nadler said this week that he didn't require McGahn's testimony to fully consider impeachment. pic.twitter.com/OejnMvqXLR \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) September 13, 2019\n\nJudges, if they are fair, don\u2019t usually like double talk and political games. That\u2019s exactly what the Democrats have been doing. They continually downplay impeachment publicly, claiming that what Nadler is doing isn\u2019t actually an impeachment inquiry, then they run to their base and tell them the opposite. Remember, we\u2019ve been assured by Democrats that what you say publicly matters to how judges should rule on your actions (i.e. Trump\u2019s tweets). Meanwhile, they want to the courts to play along with this scam, giving them near unlimited power of investigation without them having to go through the proper channels to get it.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, if Nadler gets away with this, it opens the door for every single House majority to target and handicap a sitting president based on nothing more than supposition and suspicion. Normal oversight is fine. Proclaiming you can override executive privilege and force testimony by abusing impeachment powers is not.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
