He said:\n\n\u201cFacebook will not be part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world until US regulators approve.\u201d\n\nNote, however, that this phrasing is not the same as an assurance that Libra will not launch at all.\n\nAccording to the remarks, Libra will be pegged mostly to U.S. dollars. Zuckerberg further leveraged China\u2019s plans to release a project similar to Libra in the coming months, stressing that it could interfere with America's financial and technological leadership in the world.\n\nPayments processing by Facebook and associated entities\n\nSpeaking about Facebook\u2019s access to Calibra wallet users\u2019 financial data, Zuckerberg said that Calibra is a regulated subsidiary of Facebook, which means that there is clear separation between Facebook\u2019s social data and Calibra\u2019s financial data.\n\n\u201cCalibra will not share customers\u2019 account information or financial data with Facebook, except to prevent fraud or criminal activity, when people affirmatively choose to share their data, or when we are legally obligated to do so,\u201d Zuckerberg ensured, adding:\n\n\u201cPayments processed through Facebook\u2019s licensed payments subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive anti-money laundering, counterterrorist financing, and sanctions monitoring that leverage both our automated systems and human review, and we report suspicious payments activity to applicable authorities consistent with our regulatory obligations. We also have policies in place to prevent fraud.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg further stressed that Libra is not created to replace sovereign currency, but to serve as an online payment system only.\n\nUsers\u2019 private data protection\n\nWorth noting is that Zuckerberg said that Facebook does not sell people\u2019s personal information, and does not use and share it with third parties for lending or credit decisions.\n\n\u201cWe use information about transactions that happen on our products to improve our services, including advertising. However, we do not use people\u2019s payment account information itself for advertising purposes,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nLast year, Facebook found itself in the crosshairs of regulatory furor when Cambridge Analytica collected Facebook user data for roughly 50 million individuals without permission. Part of the information Facebook collects includes personally identifiable data. Moreover, the company gathers information about others in a user\u2019s network.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to tell Congress that Libra will not launch anywhere in the world until U.S. regulators approve it", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy82M2I2MjMxYjVmZDU3NWM1MTcxMjFiZmNhZTViZGY3YS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
