Rosanna Scotto and Lori Stokes pulled double duty, showing up both as guests and as reporters, interviewing \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d team for \u201cGood Day New York.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Wendy Williams had the crowd yelling louder for her than for Aniston and Witherspoon when she stepped onto the black carpet in her light pink suit and a short blonde wig. Fox 5 morning stars And the tip sheet (a guest list handed out to reporters on the red carpet) boasted bold-faced names such as Gayle King, Arianna Huffington, Gretchen Carlson, George Stephanopoulos, Diane Sawyer and Regis Philbin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that Apple is launching a streaming service with an ode to broadcast TV,\u201d Stelter told Variety. \u201cThere\u2019s something special about that \u2014 it actually speaks to the enduring power of morning television and that no matter what changes in television or in streaming, people still want to turn on the television and see someone they trust and someone that they like.\u201d\n\nStelter says that when he sold the rights to his book, he never imagined it would actually get made. But when he got the call that Witherspoon had signed on, he knew it was a done deal. Stelter worked with \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d team as a consulting producer to provide an accurate sense of the atmosphere in the world of morning news, including details such as the toll that early morning hours take on the staff. Apple\u2019s story is fictional, but as real-life events have played out over the past two years with the Me Too movement dominating the news business, the series became all the more relevant for audiences who\u2019ve been consumed with real scandals playing across their television screens and the stories within news organizations have become perhaps the biggest stories to come out of the same organizations in recent years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much that I didn\u2019t know, and that we didn\u2019t know, when my book came out in 2013,\u201d Stelter said, referring to events like Matt Lauer\u2019s Today show firing after sexual assault complaints and Charlie Rose\u2019s ouster from CBS after numerous sexual harassment allegations. \u201cI\u2019ve updated it twice with new chapters because of the new developments since.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time is perfect timing for this show,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cBut I think Ronan Farrow\u2019s book has drawn much-deserved attention onto the continued controversies in this space.\u201d\n\nWitherspoon says that while the show tackles significant cultural topics, she doesn\u2019t think of the show as a learning lesson, but rather as an entertaining show for viewers.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of twists and turns, and there\u2019s lots to talk about \u2014 ageism, sexism, racism, sexual assault,\u201d Witherspoon told Variety. \u201cWe dive right into all of those topics, so it\u2019ll definitely be a good conversation starter.\u201d\n\nAniston says \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d doesn\u2019t \u201ctake any side\u201d when it comes to addressing the Me Too movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pulling the curtain on it in a way where you\u2019re watching everyone stumble through what the new normal is in a very honest and a very messy way,\u201d Aniston said. It allows you to watch from your perspective.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
