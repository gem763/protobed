Piper Jaffray has an overweight price target on Tesla with a $372 a share price target.\n\nShares of Tesla rose as much 18.2% in trading from its previous close of $254.68. If that gain holds through Thursday, it would be Tesla's best single day of trading since May 2013.\n\nOpening above $300, Tesla shares returned to levels not seen since February this year. However, the stock remained negative for the year, down 3.2% for 2019.\n\n\"Moreover, management projected a bullish tone on near-term demand, indicating that they were 'highly confident' in exceeding their Q4 deliveries guidance of 105k cars,\" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note to investors. Bernstein has a market-perform rating on Tesla with a $325 price target.\n\nEven more skeptical analysts, such as UBS' Patrick Hummel, noted that Tesla showed \"solid\" free cash flow in the quarter. As UBS has a sell rating and $160 price target on UBS, Hummel said the firm intends \"to review our financial model on Tesla following the results.\"", "description": "Tesla turned in an unexpectedly profitably third-quarter and better than anticipated progress on its Shanghai factory.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105833918-1554471469981musk_r.jpg?v=1561030450", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
