Now that Kurdish-led militia is acting as jailers for tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and their families being held in camps and prisons in northern Syria near the Turkish border.\n\nThe leaders of neighboring Turkey, which has battled Kurdish separatists at home for decades, saw the Syrian Kurdish militia as a threat and talked openly of a cross border campaign to crush it \u2014 if only the American troops got out of the way.\n\nBut despite the warnings about a United States interest in protecting its loyal Kurdish allies and in containing the ISIS prisoners, Mr. Trump this week portrayed the plights of the Kurds as someone else\u2019s problem. Referring to the Turks and Kurds as \u201cnatural enemies,\u201d he said, \u201cIt is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own country.\u201d\n\nAs soon as Mr. Trump moved the fewer than a hundred American troops from a border area, Turkey unleashed its cross border assault on Wednesday. By Friday, there was evidence that ISIS was already attempting to regroup amid the chaos. Five militants had escaped from a Kurdish-run prison and ISIS claimed responsibility for a bombing in a provincial capital.\n\nThe decision to allow the Turkish advance came less than a month after Mr. Trump spooked American partners in the region by appearing to back down from another confrontation, that one against Iran.\n\n", "description": "President Trump\u2019s acquiescence to a Turkish raid on the Kurds in northern Syria alarmed allies for its unpredictability as much as its betrayal.", "authors": ["David D.
