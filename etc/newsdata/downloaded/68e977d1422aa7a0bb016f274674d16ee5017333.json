His death was ruled a homicide by an Armed Forces medical examiner. It's one of 10 deaths under investigation by authorities. Jack Gruber, USA TODAY\n\nNurse Charles Cullen worked at nine hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, killing dozens of patients by spiking saline IV bags with deadly doses of drugs physicians did not order and patients did not need.\n\nDonald Harvey, who worked as an orderly among other hospital jobs, roamed units at three hospitals in Cincinnati and Kentucky where he killed more than two dozen patients.\n\nThe health care killers used insulin, heart drugs or poisons such as cyanide. They had access to frail patients on hospital floors. Ultimately, they were convicted of murdering patients under their care.\n\nAs investigators assemble clues in at least two homicides and at least eight other suspicious deaths at a Clarksburg, West Virginia, Veterans Affairs hospital, past examples of health care workers who killed patients with unneeded medications \u2014 including insulin, the drug suspected in the VA deaths \u2014 show how difficult such cases can be to detect and prove.\n\n'I trusted those people': Red flags missed, limiting evidence in potential serial killer case at VA hospital\n\nCullen moved from hospital to hospital, taking new jobs when managers began to suspect his deadly ways. Although investigators collected forensic evidence implicating him, prosecutors did not charge him until a fellow nurse, wearing a wire, coaxed a confession.\n\nHarvey\u2019s arrest was a matter of luck. He used cyanide to poison a man hospitalized after a motorcycle crash, unwittingly triggering an Ohio law requiring autopsies on all motorcycle fatalities. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy had a genetic ability to smell cyanide, which triggered the investigation.\n\nFILE \u2013 In this Sept. 1987 file photo, serial killer Donald Harvey stands before a judge during sentencing in Cincinnati.

Such cases are distinct from medical errors in which doctors, nurses or other clinicians inadvertently harm or even kill patients through carelessness or mistakes.\n\nThese serial killers are often called \"angels of death,\" but those familiar with their behavior say the moniker rarely describes their crimes. More often, they kill with intent and out of compulsion, not compassion.\n\nElizabeth Yardley, a criminology professor at Birmingham City University in England, studies nurses who kill. In a 2014 research paper, she identified 16 convicted of murder over the past four decades in the United States, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\nInsulin was the drug most frequently used to poison patients. But health care killers also used sedatives, muscle relaxers, blood thinners, heart drugs and even bleach. Some started with one drug and moved to another as the pace of their killings increased.\n\nIn most cases, the killers poisoned patients with drugs taken from the hospital where they worked. Some nurses had legitimate access to the medicines. Others stole the drugs, bypassing safeguards to secure medication.\n\n\u201cThis is the challenge of investigating homicide in a health care setting \u2014 the suspects you are looking at are members of a staff,\" Yardley said. \u201cThose members have legitimate access to victims. They have the opportunity to harm them.\n\n\u201cIt can be an investigative nightmare.\u201d\n\n'You can't prove anything'\n\nCullen\u2019s string of suspicious deaths began in the late 1980s, after he landed his first nursing job through a staffing agency at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey.\n\nAs recounted in the book \u201cThe Good Nurse\u201d by journalist Charles Graeber, Saint Barnabas nurses in February 1991 noticed two patients in the hospital\u2019s critical care unit mysteriously crashing from low blood sugar levels. The patients appeared to get better as soon as they were disconnected from an IV bag.\n\nHospital security staff discovered the IV bags contained insulin, which wasn't ordered by doctors. Investigators found small needle marks on the perimeter of the bags. A review of records uncovered reports of several patients unexpectedly crashing from hypoglycemia.\n\n'Breaks my heart': After 10 suspicious deaths at VA hospital, veterans demand answers. 'It's scary \u2013 really scary'\n\nMaking the case for foul play was not easy. The patients had a range of health conditions that made them vulnerable, and completing a complex medical investigation proved difficult. Hospital security installed cameras in the medical storage room and the administration tightened requirements for staff accessing insulin.\n\nCullen was interviewed about the tampered IV bags but he was defiant. According to \u201cThe Good Nurse\u201d he told security, \u201cYou can\u2019t prove anything.\u201d\n\nCullen was right. Though the hospital suspected him, it lacked evidence to prove he sabotaged IV bags by injecting insulin, \u201csending them out like grenades\u201d to vulnerable patients, as Graeber wrote. And when security informed the local police department, the department\u2019s chief had little interest in taking on the case.\n\nSaint Barnabas moved Cullen off the work schedule. He easily found another nursing job, a pattern that continued over the next decade and a half at hospital after hospital.\n\nThe hospitals did not collect meaningful evidence. They did not publicly report \u201csentinel events\u201d \u2014 unexpected incidents involving death or serious injury \u2014 even though they were required to under federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid rules for all participating hospitals.\n\n\u201cHe was caught over and over again, or at least suspected strongly enough that he was removed from the hospital,\" Graeber said. \"What happened time and time again is he was moved on with neutral or positive references.\u201d\n\nHospital oversight: \u2018I trusted those people.\u2019 Red flags missed, limiting evidence in potential serial killer case at VA hospital\n\nCullen's actions finally caught up to him at New Jersey\u2019s Somerset Medical Center, after four people died from non-prescribed doses of insulin and the heart drug digoxin. He was suspected, but the hospital wanted to conduct its own probe before notifying outside investigators.\n\nMore patients died before Somerset administrators, under pressure from the director of the state\u2019s poison control center, finally went to police. Detectives, however, could not gather enough forensic evidence to seal the investigation. They convinced a nurse who was friendly with Cullen to wear a recording device. During a conversation, Cullen told her he wanted to \"go down fighting.\"\n\nHe confessed, pleaded guilty to killing 13 patients at Somerset and agreed to cooperate with authorities in lieu of the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison. It\u2019s unknown how many people he killed during his nearly two decades of nursing. Cullen told detectives he killed as many as 40, but Graeber\u2019s research put the likely death toll at about 400.\n\nBefore he was arrested, Cullen knew Somerset suspected him in the string of deaths. He was preparing to move on to another hospital like he had so many times before.\n\n\u201cCullen had another job lined up,\u201d Graeber said. \u201cIt really did take a confession to be able to put him away. Everything else was circumstantial, difficult to prove.\u201d\n\nTesting for insulin is tricky\n\nVincent Marks, a pathologist and retired University of Surrey professor, is among the world\u2019s foremost experts on insulin killings.\n\nHe became interested in low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, as a doctor in the late 1950s. He discovered a patient with unexplained low blood sugar had a tumor that was secreting insulin. He went on to write the book, \u201cInsulin Murders: True Life Cases.\u201d\n\nHe said the first known case of insulin murder occurred in 1957 and involved an English nurse, Kenneth Barlow, who was convicted of poisoning his wife.\n\n\u201cHe was successful, but he didn\u2019t really succeed,\u201d said Marks. \u201cIt takes such a long time to die from insulin poisoning. He gave up and drowned her.\u201d\n\nTo prove homicide by insulin, Marks said investigators need foresight to collect the right evidence and perform the right tests in a timely manner. Blood must be drawn while the patient is alive or within hours of death, he said, and both the presence of insulin and an absence of C-peptide, which measures insulin made by the body, must be detected.\n\nInsulin homicides: 'Definitely suspicious': Investigation into patient deaths at West Virginia VA hospital expands\n\nImmunoassay tests commonly used to measure insulin might not be sensitive enough to prove fatal insulin doses. A newer technology, called mass spectrometry, is often required but rarely used, Marks said.\n\n\u201cUnless they actually have thought about it and collected the blood \u2026 done the tests during life or immediately after death, and used the best possible methods, it can be deceptive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is extremely difficult to prove.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s especially important to use correct testing when a victim is injected with insulin analogs, a newer synthetic form of insulin preferred by many people with diabetes, Marks added.\n\n\u201cIf you can identify an analog in somebody\u2019s blood, or vitreous (eyeball tissue) you know somebody has been doing something they shouldn\u2019t have done,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you find natural insulin, you can\u2019t be sure whether it is from the bottle or from somebody\u2019s own body.\"\n\nAs part of the recent investigation into the suspicious deaths at the West Virginia VA hospital, the bodies of Army veteran Felix Kirk McDermott, 82, and Air Force Veteran George Nelson Shaw, 81, were exhumed.\n\nBoth deaths were classified as homicides. A federal medical examiner concluded insulin was injected into McDermott\u2019s abdomen and Shaw\u2019s autopsy revealed injection sites tested positive for insulin. Neither man had diabetes. The insulin injections sent the blood sugar levels of both veterans crashing to fatally low levels.\n\nAuthorities are investigating 10 suspicious veteran deaths at the VA hospital in Clarksburg, West Virginia. (Photo: Handout)\n\nFamily members interviewed by investigators say they were told a person of interest, who has since been removed from patient care, may have been responsible for the deaths of as many as 10 patients on Unit 3A by insulin injection.\n\nThe person has not been charged. A hospital spokesman said the person was removed from patient contact.\n\nMarks said he is not familiar with the specifics of the West Virginia cases, but notedinvestigators face an enormous challenge building a case solely on forensic evidence.\n\n\u201cIt (insulin) disappears quite rapidly once somebody dies,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very skeptical about this idea of exhuming bodies and finding insulin.\u201d\n\n'They want it swept under the carpet'\n\nCases of health care workers poisoning patients with insulin are rare. Most nurses convicted of mass murder carried out their killings in the 1990s and 2000s, Yardley found, and many exhibited \u201cred flag\u201d behaviors.\n\nThe killer nurses had higher death rates on their shift, struggled with mental instability or depression and made colleagues feel anxious. They also were more likely to volunteer for the night shift and move from hospital to hospital.\n\nFrequently changing jobs might be a sign that the nurses left jobs when their actions became suspicious, she noted.\n\n\u201cIt could be the case that they have killed before and it hadn\u2019t been detected,\u201d Yardley said. \u201cVery often, hospitals want to be very careful with their public relations. They don\u2019t want patients to know there had been some type of issue like this. They want it swept under the carpet.\u201d\n\nHarvey, the Cincinnati orderly and nursing assistant, had been on his third hospital job when he was arrested and charged in 1987. His health care career included stints at a London, Kentucky hospital, the Cincinnati VA Medical Center and finally Drake Hospital in Cincinnati.\n\nA man named John Powell crashed his motorcycle and soon found himself on Harvey\u2019s floor. Powell\u2019s injuries were not life threatening until Harvey put cyanide and water in a feeding tube.\n\nLike all motorcycle crash victims in Ohio, Powell was autopsied \u2014 and a deputy coroner happened to have a genetic ability to smell cyanide.\n\n\u2018It was pure luck,\u201d Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said.\n\nHarvey confessed and pleaded guilty to killing 37 people at the three hospitals using cyanide, arsenic, insulin and other substances. In media interviews, he admitted to killing even more patients.\n\n\u201cHe initially claimed it was a mercy killing,\u201d said Deters. But a psychiatrist concluded, \u201che liked to kill people. This is not a mercy killing. He has a compulsion to kill.\u201d\n\nHarvey died in 2017 after a beating by another inmate at an Ohio state prison.\n\nDeters said investigators learned Harvey was fired from the VA for storing organ samples in his locker, but Drake Hospital never checked his work history. After the murders were uncovered, the administrator changed his application to make it appear the hospital had checked with past employers. The hospital administrator was charged and convicted for doctoring the application.\n\nGraeber\u2019s research on Cullen showed a similar pattern. Hospitals where he worked often delayed reporting sentinel events that should have triggered an investigation by state health department inspectors.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be one bad guy out there in any field,\u201d Graeber said. \u201cYou have institutions that are supposed to safeguard their people and not prioritize limiting liability.\u201d\n\nIn Clarksburg, veterans and family members want answers about the suspicious deaths at Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center. They\u2019ve questioned the hospital\u2019s oversight. They've grown frustrated with the pace of the investigation.\n\nDebbie Cutler is the daughter of a Korean War veteran John Hallman, 87, who died in June 2018 after a night at the Clarksburg VA hospital. Federal agents told the family he died under suspicious circumstances with his blood sugar plummeting. His death has not been classified as homicide.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any arrest \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re still waiting for,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cThey are working on having a rock-solid case against this person. That is what they tell us every time we talk to them. We will have to be patient and wait.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/10/18/clarksburg-west-virginia-veterans-affairs-deaths-medical-murders/3936045002/", "description": "A string of suspicious deaths at the Clarksburg VA hospital in West Virginia could prove to be an \"investigative nightmare.\" Here's why.", "authors": ["Ken Alltucker", "Published A.M.
