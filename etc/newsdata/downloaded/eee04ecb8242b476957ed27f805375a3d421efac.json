The FDA said it's concerned the ads might convey that switching to Juul is a safer alternative to cigarettes.\n\nCompanies can't advertise their products as less harmful than cigarettes without the FDA first approving the claims, and Juul has not yet submitted an application with the FDA. Federal health officials, along with the president, are calling for a broad crackdown on flavored e-cigarettes, a market led by Juul, as millions of teenagers reported using the products and amid the outbreak of a mysterious lung disease that has sickened hundreds and killed at least six people.\n\nIn its letter to Juul, the FDA asked for documents and other information regarding its marketing, advertising, promotional and education campaigns as well as product development activity. Specifically, the FDA is looking for any scientific evidence or data that shows whether its use of words like \"switch\" and \"alternative\" give people the idea that Juul's e-cigarettes are less harmful than combustible cigarettes.\n\nThe letter muddies Juul's attempts to rebrand itself and adds another headache to the company, which is already battling accusations that it fueled a teen vaping epidemic. It also brings e-cigarette advertising into the spotlight, raising questions about whether companies should be allowed to market at all.\n\nSeparately, the company has 15 days to respond to an FDA warning letter, which focused on testimony alleging Juul representatives promoted their e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes in presentations to schools and Native American tribes.\n\nAccording to ad measurement company iSpot, Juul has spent more than $29 million on 8,717 airings of television spots in the U.S. since Jan. 8, the day the campaign was announced. The ads also appeared via print, online and radio, including a full-page print ad saying, \"The average smoker tries to quit over 30 times. Make the switch.\"", "description": "The FDA sent Juul a warning letter this week about its campaign urging people to \"Make the Switch\" from cigarettes, but the company isn't backing down.", "authors": ["Megan Graham Angelica Lavito", "Megan Graham", "Angelica Lavito", "In Angelicalavito"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105958881-1560198307812juul.jpg?v=1560198346"}
