The two men were sitting next to each other at an appearance on Tuesday in New York, where the U.N.\u2019s General Assembly is meeting, and reporters were asking both of them about the biggest blow to Johnson yet: a ruling earlier that day by the U.K. Supreme Court that his advice to the Queen (which she follows as a matter of course) to approve a five-week prorogation, or suspension, of Parliament had been \u201cunlawful.\u201d Johnson began, \u201cWe\u2019re full of respect, as I say, for the justices of our Supreme Court.\u201d Before he got that sentence out, Trump broke into a broad grin and practically guffawed. He pointed his thumb at Johnson, in a fond, look-at-this-guy gesture. The idea that the fullness of Johnson included respect for the justices seemed to strike the President as hilarious. \u201cIn other words, he\u2019s been very nice to the Court, please. O.K.?\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe reason for Trump\u2019s bemusement became clear the next day, when Johnson stood before the House of Commons. He was neither very nice nor even minimally decent. He engaged in a florid display of disrespect not only for the Supreme Court, whose decision he dismissed as \u201cwrong,\u201d but also for Parliament, and for the democratic principles that both institutions represent. He also turned down chances to apologize to the Queen, either for lying to her (something that the Court implied, but did not directly say, he had done) or just for giving her miserably bad advice and dragging her into the whole mess. He accused his opponents of betraying their country and trying to force a \u201csurrender\u201d to the European Union. He called them cowards and seemed to mock the memory of Jo Cox, an M.P. who had campaigned to remain in the E.U. and was assassinated, in 2016, by a man who said, before he shot and stabbed her, \u201cThis is for Britain\u201d and \u201cPut Britain first.\u201d Johnson was, in short, unchastened, despite how devastating the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had been. The eleven justices found unanimously that Johnson had acted in order to stop Parliament from carrying out \u201cits constitutional functions\u201d in the crucial weeks leading up to the October 31st deadline for the U.K. to leave the European Union. (The terms of Brexit are still unsettled; there is a lot of work to do.) As a remedy, the Supreme Court declared the whole prorogation null and void. This meant that, technically, Parliament hadn\u2019t ever adjourned; it was as if, the judges wrote, the Queen\u2019s commissioners, who formally delivered the written order shutting down Parliament, had instead \u201cwalked in with a blank piece of paper.\u201d Johnson cut his trip to New York short in order to address the M.P.s, who had promptly reassembled and were in a state of uproar. They wanted an apology\u2014\u201cSay sorry!\u201d Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, demanded\u2014but he delivered insults.\n\nJohnson left behind an American President who has his own troubles. It is tempting to wonder if the time that Johnson spent with Trump contributed to his wild, ill-considered appearance in Parliament. Trump probably didn\u2019t have a sobering effect. And yet it may be more likely that the men share a certain character\u2014mendacious, narcissistic, destructive\u2014than that one influenced the other.\n\nThe parallels go beyond style. The fundamental issues that the U.K.\u2019s Supreme Court had to consider echo those that Trump has forced the U.S. Supreme Court to confront. For example, Johnson\u2019s government lawyers had argued that the Court didn\u2019t even have a right to consider whether he had acted properly in the exercise of his executive powers\u2014that the matter wasn't \u201cjusticiable.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers had made similar arguments at different stages in the various cases regarding his travel ban. And Johnson\u2019s flimsy pretext for a prorogation\u2014that his team needed the five weeks to put together a Queen\u2019s Speech on the \u201cdynamic\u201d domestic policies that it wanted to pursue, which no one believed\u2014recalls the Trump Administration\u2019s claim that the reason it wanted to add a citizenship question to the census was to protect minority voting rights. In both cases, they were effectively arguing that, as long as they come up with some reason for using an executive power, it doesn\u2019t matter if the reason is dubious or entirely fabricated\u2014any excuse is good enough. But reasons do matter: Trump, for example, can withhold military aid from Ukraine for all sorts of reasons; destroying a political opponent doesn\u2019t sound like one of them. In both nations, the Courts pushed back. As Ian Blackford, the parliamentary leader of the Scottish National Party, put it, \u201cThe Prime Minister fought the law, but the law won.\u201d\n\nJohnson, in Parliament, clung to the idea that the Supreme Court didn\u2019t have the right to examine what he was doing. \u201cIt is absolutely no disrespect to the judiciary to say that the court was wrong,\u201d he said; the Court shouldn\u2019t have meddled in what he called a \u201cpolitical\u201d matter. He further declined to distance himself from a reported comment by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tories\u2019 parliamentary leader and an unctuous Brexiteer, that the Supreme Court decision was a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d\u2014ur-Trumpian language. Johnson derided his opponents for \u201crunning to the courts to block and delay,\u201d as if there is something unsporting in insisting on the constitutionality of an official act. (The Supreme Court had, in its ruling, responded to cases brought forward in Scotland\u2019s court system by Joanna Cherry, an M.P. with the S.N.P., and in England by Gina Miller, a businesswoman and anti-Brexit campaigner, who was joined by a raft of M.P.s and by the former Tory Prime Minister John Major.) It was all part and parcel, Johnson said, of their \u201cselfishness and political cowardice.\u201d\n\nEven as Johnson\u2019s own delusions were being exposed, he addressed the benches in the House of Commons where the Labour Party members sit: \u201cThe members opposite are living in a fantasy world.\u201d Before Parliament was prorogued, it had passed a law requiring Johnson to at least ask the E.U. for an extension if there is no deal on the terms for Brexit by the deadline, in order to prevent the country and its economy from going off a cliff. This is what he called the \u201csurrender act.\u201d In a growing crescendo, a number of M.P.s, several of them women, asked him to refrain from using the language of treachery, invoking Jo Cox and, in some cases, threats that they themselves had received. He did not: surrender, surrender, surrender, he said. Finally, Paula Sherriff, a Labour M.P., rose, almost shaking with anger.\n\n\u201cI genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate,\u201d she began. But \u201cwe stand here, Mr. Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend, with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day, and let me tell the Prime Minister that they often quote his words\u2014\u2018surrender act,\u2019 \u2018betrayal,\u2019 \u2018traitor\u2019\u2014and I for one am sick of it.\u201d Johnson, she said, should be \u201cabsolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to say, Mr. Speaker, I\u2019ve never heard such humbug in all my life,\u201d Johnson replied, lightly. There were gasps and boos; someone shouted, \u201cDisgusting!\u201d\n\nJohnson seemed not to care. In the questioning that followed, he said that the best way to honor Cox\u2019s memory was \u201cto get Brexit done\u201d; he suggested that if people didn\u2019t like \u201csurrender act\u201d he would call the law in question the \u201ccapitulation\u201d or \u201chumiliation\u201d act. And he kept talking about surrender. Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, tweeted, \u201cAs of tonight, there\u2019s a gaping moral vacuum where the office of Prime Minister used to be. I didn\u2019t know Jo Cox but I\u2019m certain this man is not fit to speak her name.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s fallback response to every criticism was, perhaps, the most Trumpian thing of all. Trump, until very recently, has been all but daring the Democrats to impeach him. Johnson, in Parliament, said that, if the M.P.s didn\u2019t like what he was doing, they should call a no-confidence vote, which could trigger a new general election. \u201cCome on! Come on! Come on, then!\u201d he shouted. And, at another point, \u201cFancy a go?\u201d The opposition parties have said that holding an election is their goal, but that the Brexit deadline means there are problems with doing so without safeguards against a crash-out in place. (Nor is it clear who would replace Johnson; there is widespread apprehension about Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, too.) Johnson dismissed the less disruptive idea that he might simply resign, which would be more in keeping with the norms of the U.K.\u2019s Parliamentary tradition. Instead, he derided his opponents for what he called their lack of \u201cgumption,\u201d saying that the way to get him to leave would be to ask Corbyn \u201cto screw his courage to the sticking place and have a general election.\u201d In other words, if Parliament is not willing to take a drastic, disruptive step, then Johnson cannot be counted on to refrain from abusing his power or flouting the law. A general election close to the Brexit deadline, an impeachment close to the U.S. Presidential election\u2014extreme politicians do not always leave their opponents with convenient choices. The trick is choosing the tools that most respect democracy.\n\nThe day before, in New York, Trump had told Johnson not to worry too much. \u201cYou know, we had\u2014we had, Boris, the first couple of months, we had been\u2014I think we were 0 for 7 with the Supreme Court.\u201d Since then, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve almost run the table.\u201d (This is not true.) \u201cSo I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d Johnson, in other words, could look at Trump and be comforted. Within a day, Trump was under siege, following the release of a damning transcript of his call with the President of Ukraine and of a whistle-blower\u2019s report alleging a coverup, and with Democrats, including the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, rallying to impeach him. But on Tuesday, looking at Johnson, whom he called his \u201cfriend,\u201d Trump kept smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I know him well,\u201d the President said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "description": "Amy Davidson Sorkin writes about the concurrent crises facing Boris Johnson\u2014the U.K. Supreme Court cancelling his prorogation of Parliament\u2014and Donald Trump\u2014the beginning of a formal congressional impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Amy Davidson Sorkin", "David Remnick", "Adam Entous", "Jane Mayer", "Atul Gawande", "John Cassidy", "Sam Knight", "Susan B.
