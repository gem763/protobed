Cognizant had hired thousands of moderators around the world to remove hate speech, terrorism, and other inappropriate content from platforms including Facebook, Google, and Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe have determined that certain content work in our Digital Operations practice is not in line with our strategic vision for the company and we intend to exit this work over time,\u201d the company told The Verge in a statement. \u201cThis work is largely focused on determining whether certain content violates client standards \u2014 and can involve objectionable materials.\u201d\n\nCognizant will honor its remaining contracts but will wind down its commitments over 2020, the company said.\n\nIn February, The Verge published an investigation into working conditions at the company\u2019s site in Phoenix. Moderators at the site described being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome after being subjected to a daily onslaught of graphic and disturbing images. Others said they had come to embrace fringe viewpoints after seeing videos about conspiracy theories on a regular basis. Multiple employees reporting fearing for their safety after being threatened by coworkers.\n\nA follow-up report in February focused on a site in Tampa, FL, where moderators broke their non-disclosure agreements to describe a pattern of mistreatment by managers. They described working in offices that were often filthy, and where cases of sexual harassment had resulted in multiple complaints being filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nThe Phoenix and Tampa sites will both close after March 1st, Facebook told The Verge in a statement. \u201cCognizant and Facebook are committed to a smooth transition during this period of change,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said.\n\nCognizant \u201cmakes up a small percentage of Facebook\u2019s global content review efforts,\u201d the spokesman said. Facebook said it would increase the number of moderators it has working at a site in Texas, which is operated by Accenture.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we work with partners is to be able to make adjustments quickly to ensure Facebook remains safe for people,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cCognizant\u2019s content reviewers have played a valuable role in keeping our platforms safe for people all over the world and we thank them for the work they\u2019ve done and continue to do.\u201d", "description": "Facebook moderators complained of filthy offices and severe mental health strain after working at Cognizant.
