It's the first commercial device to track debris that small, though it joins a larger radar network that LeoLabs runs to provide real-time data about objects in low-Earth orbit. (That's the zone where most human-made space objects are clustered.)\n\nThat data that LeoLabs collects can help satellite operators and government agencies, like NASA and JAXA (Japan's space agency), avoid catastrophic collisions with space debris.\n\nIt could also help prevent a scenario in which the orbital junk gets out of control and cuts off our access to space for hundreds of years.\n\n\"Nobody is telling you where the debris is, what's the likelihood it's going to hit your satellite. So we wanted to create that service,\" Dan Ceperley, LeoLabs' co-founder and CEO, told Business Insider. \"If it hits your satellite, it can shatter your satellite. So not only is your satellite gone, but now you've got a cloud of debris that is threatening your other satellites and threatening other people's satellites.\"\n\nLeoLabs is based in San Francisco, though its new device is in New Zealand. It will make data about an estimated 250,000 bits of tiny space junk available to private companies for the first time.\n\nLeoLabs\n\nTracking these small objects can help companies maneuver their satellites to avoid catastrophic collisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 100 million of bits of junk surround Earth, from abandoned satellites, spacecraft that broke apart, and other space missions.\n\nDLR\n\nThese bits of debris circle in low-Earth orbit (LEO): the altitudes between 160 and 2,000 kilometers (99 to 1,200 miles). That's where most human-made space objects congregate, including the International Space Station and thousands of satellites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach piece of space debris, no matter how small, travels at speeds high enough to inflict catastrophic damage to vital equipment. A single hit could be deadly to astronauts on a spacecraft.", "description": "Tracking tiny bits of debris in space could help us avoid a potential disaster known as a Kessler event.", "authors": ["Morgan Mcfall-Johnsen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AoRakJZNYHD3oih_q0l5aA--~B/aD0xMTI0O3c9MTQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/f068b91ac6efabf9322562b8ff6b1b75", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
