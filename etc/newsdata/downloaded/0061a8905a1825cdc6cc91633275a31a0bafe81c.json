The Afghan government remains mostly on the sidelines of the U.S. effort to end America\u2019s longest war. And as Trump\u2019s reelection campaign heats up, his quest to withdraw the remaining 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan remains unfulfilled.\n\nTrump said he axed the Camp David meetings and called off negotiations because of a recent Taliban bombing near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul that killed a U.S. service member, even though nine other Americans have died since June 25 in Taliban-orchestrated violence.\n\nTrump\u2019s secret plan for high-level meetings at the presidential retreat in Maryland resembled other bold, unorthodox foreign policy initiatives \u2014 with North Korea, China and Iran \u2014 that the president has pursued that have yet to bear fruit.\n\n\u201cWhen the Taliban tried to gain negotiating advantage by conducting terror attacks inside of the country, President Trump made the right decision to say that\u2019s not going to work,\u201d said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appeared Sunday on five TV news shows.\n\n\u201cIf the Taliban don\u2019t behave, if they don\u2019t deliver on the commitments that they\u2019ve made to us now for weeks and in some cases months, the president of the United States is not going to reduce the pressure,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nTrump\u2019s three high-profile meetings with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un \u2014 including the president\u2019s recent brief footsteps onto North Korean soil \u2014 prompted deep unease from many quarters, including his conservative base in Congress.\n\nAnd while the meetings produced the ready-for-television visuals that Trump is known to relish, negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have been stalled for months with no tangible progress in getting the North to abandon its nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump\u2019s offers to hold talks with the Iranian leadership have similarly met with no result and Iran has moved ahead with actions that violate the 2015 nuclear deal that the president withdrew from last year.\n\nWith China, Trump has vigorously pursued a trade war, imposing billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports that have yet to force a retreat by Beijing. So far, the discussions have unsettled financial markets and have resulted in retaliatory steps by both Beijing and Washington.\n\nPompeo defended Trump\u2019s foreign policy, depicting it as tough diplomacy, rather than naivete or inexperience.\n\n\u201cHe walked away in Hanoi from the North Koreans where they wouldn\u2019t do a deal that made sense for America,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cHe\u2019ll do that with the Iranians. When the Chinese moved away from the trade agreement that they had promised us they would make, he broke up those conversations, too.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said Trump\u2019s decision to nix a deal with the Taliban was evidence that he was moving too quickly to get one.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said the talks were ill-conceived from the start because they haven\u2019t yet involved the Afghan government.\n\nThe Taliban have refused to negotiate with the government its sees as illegitimate and a puppet of the West so the Trump administration tried another approach, negotiating with the Taliban first to get a deal that would lead to Taliban talks with Afghans inside and outside the government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another example of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy, which is a high-wire act that ultimately is focused on Trump as a persona but not in the strategic, methodical effort of creating peace,\u201d Menendez said.\n\nCriticism of the Camp David plan was not limited to Democrats or \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\u201d\n\nA U.S. official familiar with the Taliban negotiations said the \u201cvery closely held\u201d idea of a Camp David meeting was first discussed a week and a half ago when Trump huddled with his national security team and other top advisers to talk about Afghanistan. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nSome administration officials, including national security adviser John Bolton, did not back the agreement with the Taliban as it was written, the official said. Bolton does not think the Taliban can be trusted. Bolton advised the president to draw down the U.S. force to 8,600 \u2014 enough to counter terror threats \u2014 and \u201clet it be\u201d until a better deal could be hammered out, the official said.\n\nPompeo said he didn\u2019t know if Trump will follow through on his pledge to reduce the number of U.S. troops there from 14,000 to 8,600.\n\nU.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad had recently announced that he had reached an agreement in principle with the Taliban. The U.S. would withdraw about 5,000 U.S. troops within 135 days of signing the deal. In exchange, the insurgents agreed to reduce violence and prevent Afghanistan from being used as a launch pad for global terror attacks, including from local Islamic State affiliate and al-Qaida.\n\nPompeo said the Taliban agreed to break with al-Qaida \u2014 something that past administrations have failed to get the Taliban to do. The insurgent group had hosted al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden as he masterminded the 9/11 attacks. After the attacks, the U.S. ousted the Taliban, who had ruled Afghanistan with a harsh version of Islamic law from 1996 to 2000.\n\nBut problems quickly emerged. Even as Khalilzad explained the deal to the Afghan people during a nationally televised interview, the Taliban detonated a car bomb targeting a compound in Kabul where many foreign contactors lived.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s office responded with loud objections, agreeing with several former U.S. ambassadors who warned that a hasty U.S. withdrawal without Taliban guarantees on ending violence could lead to \u201ctotal civil war.\u201d\n\nFar from guaranteeing a cease-fire, the deal included only a reduction in violence in Kabul and neighboring Parwan province, where the U.S. has a military base.\n\nThen on Thursday, a second Taliban car bomb exploded in Kabul and killed 12 people including a U.S. service member. Khalilzad abruptly returned to Qatar for at least two days of negotiations with the Taliban, but has since been recalled to Washington.\n\nThe Afghan government says it doesn\u2019t believe talks between the United States and Taliban will continue \u201cat this stage.\u201d It is bracing for Sept. 28 presidential elections, which the Taliban have threatened to disrupt with violence.\n\nTrump\u2019s suspension of the negotiations \u201cwill harm America more than anyone else,\u201d the Taliban said in a statement. \u201cIt will damage its reputation, unmask its anti-peace policy to the world even more, increase its loss of life and treasure and present its political interactions as erratic.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s weekend tweet canceling secret meetings at Camp David with the Taliban and Afghan leaders just days before the anniversary of the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ717_19trum_ZG_20190904201152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
