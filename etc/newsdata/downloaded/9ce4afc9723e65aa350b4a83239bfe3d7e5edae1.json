In the three games played in Washington last weekend, all losses, they proceeded to score only one run each night and combined to go 1-for-21 with runners in scoring position.\n\nThe Nationals led MLB in the regular season with 612 RBI with runners in scoring position, averaging .279. They were the kings of stringing together a few hits at a time and capitalizing on their chances. So what\u2019s going on?\n\nBatters aren\u2019t swinging and missing at an unusually high rate. There\u2019s been some pitch-chasing, but not much of it. Indeed, the Nationals have been making good contact \u2014 but those shots have been finding their way to the Houston Astros\u2019 gloves too easily.\n\n\u201cWe barrelled a lot of baseballs and they went to a lot of fielders,\u201d Anthony Rendon said with a rueful chuckle, \u201cwhere they took either two steps or no steps or just they were playing in the right position.\u201d\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s 7-1 loss in Game 5, which gave Houston a 3-2 series lead, Trea Turner said he could remember five line-outs off the top of his head. He had the number dead on: The Nationals lined out five times in Game 5 as well as five in Game 4.\n\nLine-outs are a good measure for why the Nationals can\u2019t get on base right now because a line drive hit indicates a well-struck ball, one that would drop for a single or double in the absence of a fielder snagging it out of the air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you realize how small of a window that every single one of those hits are from either being a homer, a hit, another out, a pop-up, a strikeout,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundredths of seconds if not millimeters on the barrel. Sometimes you hit them at people, sometimes you don\u2019t. Hopefully we don\u2019t hit them at people.\u201d\n\nSo the Nationals believe being unlucky is part of the deal, but the Astros have done what they can on defense to stifle Washington\u2019s hits.\n\nThe Astros relied on the defensive shift more than any other American League team this year, shifting their fielders 49.4% of the time, according to Baseball Savant. Only the Los Angeles Dodgers shifted more often.\n\nBut Houston did this especially to combat lefty hitters \u2014 like Juan Soto. The Astros utilized a defensive shift against a remarkable 77.2% of all left-handed at-bats this year.\n\nSoto does have two home runs during this World Series, and those render a shift moot. But he\u2019s also lined out into the shift. In the first inning of Game 4, Astros third baseman Alex Bregman stood much closer to second base when he caught Soto\u2019s would-be hit; it ended the inning, stranding Rendon after a single.\n\n\u201cI think one, it\u2019s baseball,\u201d Rendon said. \u201cYou can put a lot of great swings on a lot of great pitches and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t roll your way. There\u2019s seven other fielders behind the pitcher. To try to find a hole sometimes is hard and difficult.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much scouting now, whether you want to call them nerds or whatever, where they put in their formulas and they do this and that. They say \u2018Position this person here, position that person there.\u2019 I think it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. We just got to try to find some holes.\u201d\n\nAdam Eaton also credited how catchers Mart\u00edn Maldonado and Robinson Chirinos have called games to keep Washington\u2019s hitters off-balance by \u201cgoing against the script.\u201d They helped Houston win games 3 and 4 without either of their aces, Gerrit Cole or Justin Verlander, on the field.\n\nVerlander heads to the mound for Houston in Game 6 with the Astros a win away from clinching their second title in three years. The Nationals will counter with Stephen Strasburg.\n\nEaton outlined the plan for facing Verlander in the must-win game.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be probably how the whole series has gone,\u201d Eaton said, \u201cwhich is, first time through, make an adjustment and try to beat them to the punch next time around, but gather as much information and intel for us first time around. Communicate.\n\n\u201cAnd hit with runners in scoring position. You guys haven\u2019t asked me that, but I\u2019ll just go ahead and touch on that,\u201d he quipped. \u201cHasn\u2019t been great \u2026 It\u2019s nothing that we can just sit down and talk about and then it happens. It\u2019s more, one hit falls, and all of a sudden it\u2019s kind of a snowball effect. The more you talk about it, the more you think about it, the worse it gets.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
