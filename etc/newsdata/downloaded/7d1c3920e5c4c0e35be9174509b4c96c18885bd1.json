Try coconut milk instead of cow\u2019s, as well as blended vegetables to achieve creaminess you need and tons of wonderful, aromatic flavors.\n\nSweet Potato, Corn and Jalape\u00f1o Bisque, above. It\u2019s the perfect seasonal transition: Summery corn and autumnal sweet potatoes blend together in a spiced, creamy soup. A healthy heaping of molasses adds a layer of complexity that keeps the soup from getting too sweet.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Bonnie S. Benwick/The Washington Post)\n\nCreamy Black-Eyed Pea Soup With Olive Pesto. Beans have a creamy texture on their own and, when blended up, can give soup body. Black-eyed peas lend their signature smokiness, which pairs beautifully with a savory, briny olive pesto.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Bonnie S. Benwick/The Washington Post)\n\nSpinach Soup With Dill and Basil. It ain\u2019t easy being green \u2014 except when it totally is! Cook potatoes and onions until tender, then blitz them with handfuls of dill and basil into this emerald green soup.\n\n\n\n(Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post; food styling by Bonnie S. Benwick/The Washington Post)\n\nRed Lentil Salsa Soup. Let\u2019s get a little spicy, shall we? With a jar of store-bought salsa and a just over a cup of lentils, this bright red soup comes together quickly and is topped with creamy avocado.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nWarm Potato and Almond Soup. Potatoes and almonds create a gorgeous, silky base for this soup that takes notes from almond gazpacho, a cousin of the classic red one you\u2019re thinking of.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nSpicy Red Pepper and Chickpea Soup. How about chickpeas two ways? One: blended up with red bell peppers, tomato and spices for the base. Two: crisped up as a topping.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nVegan Ramen Bowls. Noodles in a sweet, coconutty broth with a topping of savory sauced-up tofu is just what we want when cool weather creeps in.\n\n\n\n(Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post)\n\nCaldo Verde With Mushrooms. Caldo verde, a Portuguese soup, often has smoked sausage, but this one eschews that for mushrooms in a smoked paprika coating.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nLima Bean Soup With Chard and Harissa. With just seven ingredients, this soup comes together fast. If you don\u2019t want to slow-cook lima beans, you can absolutely reach for a can, which makes this soup even faster. If you want another spin on lima bean soup, this one with turmeric, scallions and herbs will be delicious.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nSpiced Carrot, Leek and Lentil Soup. Chunky or smooth, this hearty soup has plenty of warmth and just a hint of heat. The recipe says to add a dollop of Greek yogurt as a garnish, but you\u2019ll love the soup without it.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nThis humble roasted broccolini toast boasts bold, satisfying flavors\n\nYour cup of coffee and these simple almond biscotti make a perfect match\n\nCarrots, get your 10 savory, earthy, sweet carrot recipes here!", "description": "Whether you're dairy-free or meat-free, these soups will hit the mark.", "authors": ["Kari Sonde", "Editorial Aide For Food", "September At Pm", "Kari Sonde Is The Editorial Aide For The Food Section", "Where She Helps With Recipes", "Cooking Questions", "Food Styling.
