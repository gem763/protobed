He did not miss, and restored his three-shot advantage with four holes remaining.\n\nWoods missed another birdie chance, from 10 feet, at the 15th and was watching from the 16th tee 181 yards away as Matsuyama walked in a 20-footer for his first birdie of the day to get to 16-under.\n\nWoods found the green safely but his putt from 25 feet never threatened the hole leaving him two ahead with two to play.\n\nMatsuyama crushed a drive down the middle of the 491-yard 17th and found the putting surface with his approach.\n\nWoods, a group behind, followed with a smooth drive into the heart of the fairway.\n\nMatsuyama\u2019s fine attempt to hole the putt slid by on the left and he stayed two adrift with only the par-five 18th to rescue his challenge.\n\nWoods found the heart of the green with his approach to 17 and two-putted safely for par.\n\nMatsuyama found the sand twice on the 18th.\n\nNeeding to get up and down to have any chance, Matsuyama\u2019s bunker shot flew to the back of the putting surface and his brave challenge was over as he finished 16-under with a final round 67.", "description": "Inzai (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods held off the challenge of home favourite Hideki Matsuyama to win the weather-delayed Zozo Championship by three", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/e95b92_tiger-woods-was-in-his-outing-arthroscopic-knee-surgery-two-months-ago-tiger-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
