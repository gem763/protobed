Some of the prior year findings were not adequately addressed,\" said Ndikandika.\n\nNdikandika said Transnet received a qualification again due to incomplete information on irregular expenditure contained in the entity\u2019s financial statements.\n\n\"Safcol was also qualified on irregular expenditure due to not having adequate systems in place to identify and report on irregular [spend].\n\n\"Denel remains stagnant with a disclaimer due to lack of adequate implementation of action places to correct last year\u2019s qualification,\" Ndikandika said.\n\nThe office of the Auditor General noted an \"overall stagnation\" in audit outcomes for entities under the Public Enterprises portfolio, with challenges for many entities in sustaining financial viability or remaining a going concern without government support.", "description": "Irregular expenditure among the entities under the Department of Public Enterprises went from R31.4bn in the 2017/18 financial year to R86.2bn in the 2018/19 financial year.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7930/101bef2021a343cfbcaca0f19e50c243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
