During our teenage years, we meet friends who think like us, whose idea of adventure matches ours and we just feel complete. These friendships are marked by different stories, inside jokes, crazy nights that we can't remember and because these friendships are also real there's hesitation and uncertainty about the future.\n\nAnd yet something changes once we get older. It's not like we can't form adult friendships, they are equally important too. But we will always be closer to those friends who have seen us be reckless, young, wild and free over those who meet us when we are older and wiser. Below you will discover why.\n\nAdult friendships are a much more calmer affair. These friendships are comfortable and supportive. Adult best friends meet you at a time when you have decided what you want to be and what side of yours you want the world to see.\n\nWith childhood friendships, you are in the process of discovering yourself, your vulnerabilities are visible to your friends, you coach them and they coach you. Your childhood and teenage friends have seen your raw side and love you for it. They have seen you commit the worst of mistakes and seen you achieve success too. They know those messy parts about us that we will never showcase to our adult friends.\n\nThere is a honesty to friendships we form when we are young that stand no chance in front of adult friendships.\n\nTo our adult friends, we might be the successful student who went to one of the best universities to study.\n\nBut to our childhood and teenage friends, we will be the student who cried and howled before every exam in the fear that we don't remember anything, we will see the questions and black out or we will fail.\n\nTo our adult friends we will come across as the most sorted people because that's what we want them to see.\n\nBut for our childhood friends, we will always be the heartbroken, looking for love, falling for stupid people who don't deserve us, little kids.\n\nTo our adult friends, we will ensure we don't say anything dumb or stupid. But for our childhood friends, we wouldn't have to think twice before speaking exactly what's on our mind.\n\nWe can pretend all we want in front of our adult friends but our childhood and teenage friends we will never be able to fool. And that's what makes us closer to them.\n\nWell, the truth is, our childhood and teenage friends can meet us after decades but we will be able to tell what we have been hiding from the world in an instant.\n\nIt's a relief that to these friends we will never have to be our most perfect, sorted selves.\n\nFor them, we can be exactly who we are, unabashedly and in all honesty.\n\nAnd that will be just enough.", "description": "And yet something changes once we get older.
