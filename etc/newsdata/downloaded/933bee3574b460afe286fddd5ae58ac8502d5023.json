That\u2019s when it becomes a problem.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even some of those users who aren\u2019t addicted but do occasionally indulge are looking down on themselves for doing it.\n\nThere seem to be incessant attitudes of self-loathing in these spaces. Users have used self-deprecating language, labelling themselves \u2018pathetic\u2019, \u2018ashamed\u2019 and even undeserving of happiness for enjoying one of life\u2019s simplest pleasures.\n\nNot only that, they seem to hate on others who engage in masturbation, whether alone or with a partner.\n\nOne post reads: \u2018In the end, it will never satisfy you. The most broken and lonely people I know from firsthand accounts are those that give their bodies away left and right.\n\n\u2018They make it harder for themselves to experience true love and will have great difficulty anchoring themselves to someone.\u2019\n\n\u2018I hate myself in the act\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThese followers are berating themselves for a pretty ordinary and normal act that they may not necessarily be addicted to.\n\nMany attest to doing it a few times a week or doing it because they haven\u2019t found a partner yet.\n\nOr they try to wean themselves off because they perceive masturbation as a sinful, perverse and detrimental act, using harmful language to describe it.\n\nShame is another major theme spread across these sites. There seem to be several reasons that people find their non-addictive masturbatory habits problematic.\n\nAlex* tells Metro.co.uk that chronic reliance on porn to orgasm affected his relationships with people.\n\n\u2018I feel flat [when I masturbate]. My brain is so used to the dopamine spikes from masturbation that I don\u2019t feel happiness at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I saw people as sex objects instead of people when I fapped a lot, and they can actually sense how you view them.\n\n\u2018Being seen as sex objects can really creep them out and potential partners. I honestly don\u2019t like not being able to feel happy. So I stopped fapping.\u2019\n\nSimilarly, Tony cites his choice of porn in making him want to stop doing it altogether.\n\n\u2018I hate myself in the act,\u2019 he explains. \u2018Furthermore, the porn [I watched] had to get weirder and weirder. I am straight, but a while ago I was using women\u2019s sex toys on myself. Like what am I really worth if all I can do is give in to lust?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very much showing how much lack of will power I have over myself.\u2019\n\nFor some users on these sites, prohibition is about prioritising romantic relationships and conserving their sexuality exclusively for their partner.\n\nWhile it\u2019s up to the individual what they want to do with their bodies, this idea that penetration (that too in an exclusive relationship) is the only legitimate way to be intimate is harmful.\n\nThis mentality of prioritising sex and seeing penetration as the end goal discredits self-love and worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlacing such importance on penis to vagina contact also does a disservice to the asexual, those with health conditions plus those from LGBTQ+ backgrounds.\n\nAnd yet some go as far as to barter with themselves to stop. A female university student on an anti-masturbating forum tells Metro.co.uk that she sets targets for herself to avoid it.\n\n\u2018I make little deals with myself. Positive reinforcement is much more effective for me. I\u2019m currently trying to reach 30 days without PMO and I tell myself that if I can reach that goal, I can buy myself a music album that I\u2019ve been really looking forward to.\n\n\u2018Sometimes there are no benefits, in the past I\u2019ve tried (with some success) to reach some milestones like that, two or three weeks without PMO just to see if that was something I was capable of, to know my worth.\u2019\n\nBut there are many benefits of self-love including stress relief, better sleep, skin, productivity, and more.\n\nCounsellor Charlene says it\u2019s important to understand that there\u2019s nothing wrong with masturbating.\n\n\u2018The purpose of the clitoris is pleasure, it\u2019s okay to explore that. Masturbating is a stress reliever and it makes you feel good.\n\n\u2018If you feel shame over non-addictive but persistent or occasional masturbation, identify where that\u2019s come from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Explore the route of your shame. Often it\u2019s to do with the way we\u2019ve been taught about sex and the culture we\u2019ve grown up in (or sometimes, religion).\n\n\u2018Get away from myths and untruths surrounding it. Keep the conversation alive with peers and friends.\u2019\n\nThose who are not entirely addicted but want to wean off may want to try a type of sex therapy called sensate focus, adds Charlene.\n\nIt\u2019s what she advises for couples not wanting penetration.\n\nSensate focus is concentrating on one\u2019s own sensory perceptions and sensuality, without the goal of orgasm.\n\nYou can try this on yourself, have a bath, massage, touch yourself in other parts of your body, not just genitals, different arousal points.\n\nThis might feel less shameful than masturbating.\n\nOccasional touching is different from an overwhelming compulsion but if you do find yourself doing it and thinking about it a lot, there are some steps you can take.\n\nSome people try to make deals with themselves to stop masturbating (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018Understand what\u2019s happening to your body,\u2019 advises Charlene.\n\n\u2018The body becomes addicted to the rush of dopamine that comes with watching porn/climaxing but it needs more and more extreme content to keep satisfying it.\n\n\u2018You might need to seek professional help if it has a stronghold over your life. Journal your progress and identify where it tends to peak i.e stressful periods, perhaps when you\u2019re humiliated or bored?\u2019\n\nIf you seek professional help or tell someone about it, it may be easier to curb it as you\u2019re held accountable.\n\nBecause putting the weight of your worth on one simple act is a huge responsibility for it to bear.\n\nAnd what it does is place a whole load of pressure and power on a personal and healthy act \u2013 an impossibly hard expectation to meet.\n\nOur professional and social lives are filled with such regimented precision (study, get married, own a home, have children etc), let\u2019s not look to the private and personal with the same attitude.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nMORE: Masturbation suit lets people with disabilities fulfil their sexual needs\n\nMORE: Keep the toxic pressure to lose weight away from masturbation\n\nMORE: Why were Kellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes invented and was it to stop masturbation?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "While there's a legitimate concern about masturbation addiction, some people who aren't necessarily addicted are hating themselves.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Why-do-people-punish-themselves-for-masturbating-6f8d_1571840529.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
