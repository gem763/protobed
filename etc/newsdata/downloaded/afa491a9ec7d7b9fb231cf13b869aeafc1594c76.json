(AP) - Strong winds and heavy snow caused power outages and temporary road closures in northwestern Montana as a wintry storm threatened to drop several feet of snow in some areas of the northern Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Great Falls reported 16 inches (41 centimeters) of snow had fallen near Marias Pass just south of Glacier National Park by early Saturday afternoon. The area is forecast to see a total of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) by the time the storm winds down Sunday night, said meteorologist Megan Syner.\n\nGusty winds on Saturday knocked down trees and damaged power lines, causing scattered outages in northwestern Montana and along the Rocky Mountain Front. Up to 30 large trees were down on the east side of Flathead Lake, the Missoulian reported.\n\nEmergency travel only was recommended in some areas along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountain Front and treacherous travel was reported around the region, including over Rogers Pass on Montana Highway 200 northwest of Helena, Syner said.\n\nFollowing the storm, temperatures are expected to drop into the teens and 20s (around minus 13 Celsius) across much of western and central Montana overnight Monday.\n\nThe weekend storm system was also bringing strong winds and snow to the mountains of northern Washington and northern Idaho.\n\nHomeless shelters in Spokane, Washington, were relaxing their entrance policies and the city was preparing a backup shelter, if needed.\n\nDave Wall, a Union Gospel Mission spokesman, said the shelter\u2019s director and Spokane\u2019s mayor agreed the mission would not enforce its drug and alcohol policies while temperatures were below freezing, as long as patrons weren\u2019t acting unsafe, The Spokesman Review reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Strong winds and heavy snow caused power outages and temporary road closures in northwestern Montana as a wintry storm threatened to drop several feet of snow in some areas of the northern Rocky Mountains.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/rockies_weather_84981_c0-162-2478-1606_s1770x1032.jpg?e90c524d19bdd5c3c302bfd51c697399d446e61c", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
