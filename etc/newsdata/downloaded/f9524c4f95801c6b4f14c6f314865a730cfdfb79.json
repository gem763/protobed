A function of Australia's opportunity society: a melange of leaders, builders, pioneers, stirrers and crooks, where anyone with a bright idea and the will to pursue it can get ahead.\n\nOur Rich List correspondents write that Australia appears to be entering the sixth age of the Rich List: its internationalisation. A quarter of the list's 76 billionaires now live abroad, up from one out of 37 a decade ago. Rich List debutant Indian car parts maker Vivek Sehgal was born in India, worked and lived here in the 1990s and subsequently gained Australian citizenship. Today he runs car parts businesses across nearly 40 countries, including India and Australia. He is part of a powerful Australian business and educational diaspora that naturally returns in some way to invest in the opportunities here.\n\nLabor spits on the rise of the super-rich as statistical proof that Australia has become a more unequal country than at any time in the past seven decades. What constipated sanctimony. Rather than a land of inequality, Australia's 76 billionaires show that this is a land of opportunity and track the rise in national prosperity.\n\nAustralia's rich list is very different from those overseas.\n\nOnly 25 of the 200 richest Australians - one in eight - started with inherited wealth. It was one in seven in 2014. A quarter of the top 20 richest were born overseas. Most of those who have inherited wealth \u2013 such as Anthony Pratt and Gina Rinehart \u2013 have taken their advantages of birth and turned them into far greater fortunes by taking risks, investing in new businesses and ultimately contributing to Australia's growth, employing people and paying taxes.\n\nMr Pratt has built his own Pratt Industries in Donald Trump's American heartland from virtually nothing alongside the family firm, Visy Industries. Mrs Rinehart has turned herself from a millionaire mining resources royalty heiress into a mining billionaire by building the massive Roy Hill mine that sells to our biggest export market, China.", "description": "The List reveals the unique nature of Australia's super wealthy: self-made, not inherited; entrepreneurial, not aristocratic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.8649%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_925%2C$x_15%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/093b3bb29de1139533035515c647885f85dd448a", "published_at": "2018-05-23"}
