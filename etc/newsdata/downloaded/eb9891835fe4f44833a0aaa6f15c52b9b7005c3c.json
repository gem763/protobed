His son came out and said he had had business discussions with his father so I think that the real issue is not what the president said, but what, indeed, did Biden\u2019s son do.\u201d\n\nMnuchin went on to repeatedly dismiss the reports on the president\u2019s pressure campaign to get Ukraine to look into his political opponent as \u201cspeculation,\u201d while at the same time saying it was a \u201cterrible precedent\u201d for Congress to be able to look at the whistleblower complaint because \u201cconversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.\u201d\n\nTapper, meanwhile, continued to grill Mnuchin on the matter despite the Trump Cabinet member\u2019s attempts to evade, eventually confronting Mnuchin with a hypothetical situation.\n\n\u201cLet me just close by asking, if for instance, President Obama had pressured a foreign leader, Putin or the president of Ukraine, anyone said 'I want you to look into Donald Trump Jr., or I want you to look into Eric Trump,' international businessmen, both of them, would you not find that inappropriate?\u201d Tapper asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on that,\u201d Mnuchin replied. \u201cWhat I do find inappropriate is the fact that Vice President Biden\u2014at the time\u2019s\u2014son did very significant business dealings in Ukraine. I, for one, find that to be concerning and to me that is the issue perhaps that should be further investigated.\u201d\n\nThe CNN anchor, however, said he didn\u2019t understand Mnuchin\u2019s answer because it appeared he was saying it is \u201cokay for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to do business all over the world and okay for Ivanka Trump to have copyrights approved all over the world while President Trump is president and while Joe Biden is vice president his son shouldn\u2019t be able to do business dealings.\u201d\n\nAs Mnuchin insisted he didn\u2019t want to \u201cgo into more of these details,\u201d Tapper fired back: \u201cWell, you\u2019re setting a precedent that the president is violating.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, I think there is a significant difference in what you\u2019re saying, okay,\u201d Mnuchin contended. \u201cWhat I was saying between Biden and his son\u2019s relationship with the Ukraine oligarch and potential business dealings that the Trump Organization has had which predated his presidency.\u201d\n\nThe CNN host, for his part, made sure to end the conversation on this issue by pointing out that \u201cthe Ukrainian prosecutor said there is no evidence of any wrongdoing\u201d by either Joe Biden or his son.", "description": "As Mnuchin insisted he didn\u2019t want to \u201cgo into more of these details,\u201d Tapper fired back: \u201cWell, you\u2019re setting a precedent that the president is violating.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569163098/state-union-jake-tapper_20_ov6u3h", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
