But last year's top goalscorer in the Women\u2019s Super League put away the only goal of the game for the reigning champions to dethrone Manchester City from the top of the table at Meadow Park and thereby ended their unbeaten run in the league.\n\nEllen White, now recovered from her knee injury, made her first appearance since the World Cup where the tournament\u2019s joint top goalscorer became a household name with her special eyes celebration, but the new signing from Birmingham City could not provide the energy up front that the Citizens needed.\n\nArsenal, who recovered from their away defeat to Chelsea in their last WSL match, are now unbeaten in their last 26 league games at home, spurred on by the loud chants from nearly 2,500 fans.\n\nMiedema, 23, who recently made the shortlist for the Ballon d\u2019Or, said, \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling this week. I haven\u2019t really trained so I had to have a bit of extra energy, so I was happy I could do that for the team. I love that Joe still played me and I think I paid him back today.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal 1-0 Manchester City", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214338138-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqP-t--XiuvYMJPd4Ncdgt2sdS9vlJWBJdL074b7cf-LA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
