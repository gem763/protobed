Six other people were wounded.\n\nIt was one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in U.S. history.\n\nAttorney Katy O'Donnell said her client is still seeking a jury trial to determine if he might be declared not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.\n\nRamos pleaded originally not guilty and not criminally responsible.
