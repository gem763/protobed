REUTERS/Arnd WIegmann\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alphabet still runs fast, but its pace is slowing. It\u2019s a common problem that comes with aging. A potential bid for device-maker Fitbit could bring new youthful energy for the $880 billion firm, or just a slightly expanded waistline.\n\nThe owner of Google showed on Monday that its core business of selling online ads still pumps out profit. Alphabet\u2019s revenue hit $40.5 billion in the third quarter of the year, an increase of 20% from last year. But that\u2019s less rapid than its rate a year ago. Internet advertising is maturing and rival Amazon is pushing hard \u2013 that business is the main component of a part of Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce giant that grew over 40%.\n\nThe offer for Fitbit that Reuters reported, citing sources, has some logic. Alphabet co-founder and Chief Executive Larry Page has made pushes in mobile devices, smart contacts and delivering broadband via balloon among others. Acquisitions played a part in several of these efforts. While some proved wildly successful \u2013 its mobile ad business success can be pinned in large part to buying the maker of the Android operating system \u2013 others, such as fiber broadband, have been duds.\n\nHealthcare is an area where Google has had little visible success. Perhaps Fitbit\u2019s experience in designing wearables will help Alphabet make useful devices for heart-rate monitoring or glucose monitors. Alphabet could bring heft that Fitbit on its own lacks. The stock is down 70% from its initial public offering in 2015, partly due to the success of Apple\u2019s Watch.\n\nGrowing sideways brings pitfalls. As well as being a distraction, an Alphabet bid for Fitbit could draw political scrutiny. Data collected by health trackers is particularly sensitive in the eyes of regulators and antitrust watchdogs have said such information would become a more important part of merger reviews. Fitbit is also a consumer brand members of Congress are likely to understand, or even use.\n\nFitbit is tiny enough to swallow whole \u2013 its market capitalization at Friday\u2019s close was just $1.1 billion \u2013 and the revenue potential from diversifying into healthcare and medical tracking devices is large. That, though, has to be weighed against the risk of regulatory flack, and a sense that Google is losing focus. There are better ways to regain a youthful stride.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Alphabet still runs fast, but its pace is slowing. It\u2019s a common problem that comes with aging.
