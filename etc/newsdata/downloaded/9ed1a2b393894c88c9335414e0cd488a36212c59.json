So far this year, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has declined to take up any House-passed bills related to gun control. And the president, who at first said he supported the implementation of universal background checks following the shootings in El Paso and Dayton last month, sidelined the idea after a phone call with Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association.\n\nThat inaction isn\u2019t new: Gun-control advocates have long struggled to shift the cultural and political dynamics that have historically made gun control so divisive. Gun ownership, for many Americans, is an essential facet of their identity. But \u201cwhen things begin to shift to [the point where] your children come home and talk about it,\u201d Sena said, \u201cthat has the potential to be a real tipping point.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategists say that congressional inertia and the influence of the NRA underscore another way health care and gun violence are analogous political issues: They give Democratic candidates clear antagonists.\n\nIn 2018, the party line was that \u201cRepublicans weren\u2019t doing anything on health care because they were bought by prescription-drug companies,\u201d Kuefler said. \u201cYou had an enemy,\u201d she added\u2014someone to villainize, to rally against. Amid the fear and frustration that many Americans feel about gun violence, Democrats can try to point to real political actors they argue are most responsible. The party has long railed against the NRA, but it may be unusually well positioned next year to convince voters to listen.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have answers. I don\u2019t necessarily buy all of them, but the Democrats have answers on this issue,\u201d Dan Eberhart, a major Republican donor who had previously raised concerns about the GOP\u2019s ties to the NRA, told me. \u201cThe whole crux of this election is who wins suburban, educated women,\u201d he added. And by not endorsing gun-control policies that are broadly popular, \u201cthe Republican Party runs the risk of becoming a fringe party in the suburbs like it is in some urban areas.\u201d", "description": "Gun violence has become personal for many people in a way that it wasn\u2019t before\u2014a shift the party can try to capitalize on.", "authors": ["Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19218511616125/facebook.jpg?1568121286"}
