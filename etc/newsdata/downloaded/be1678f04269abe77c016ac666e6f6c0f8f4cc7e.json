Under $20: One of the best French presses we've ever used\n\nFor the best cup of coffee you'll ever make. (Photo: Bodum)\n\nI'm constantly battling with myself every morning over whether or not to make coffee or get it to go, but when I do make myself coffee in the morning, this French press from Bodum is the one I always use. It's one of the best French presses we've ever tested, and if you want a smooth, aromatic cup of coffee, it's definitely the way to go. There's no cover in front of the pouring spout, which is important to keep in mind before you buy since your coffee will cool down faster, but that shouldn't be a problem if you're making it just for yourself. Right now, you can get it for about $15, which isn't the lowest price we've ever seen, but is still a great discount. This also makes a great gift for coffee lovers.\n\nGet the Bodum Brazil French Press Coffee Maker for $15.25 (Save $4.75)\n\n5.
