People all over the world will be using specialised tools that might have been developed on the other side of the globe.\"\n\nThe Variant Spark tool is already being used by Project MinE to try and determine what genes might be involved in motor neurone disease, also known as ALS,\n\nThe Project MinE team had accumulated 22,000 genome sequences, and when Variant Spark was applied to the Australian cohort of data it was able to find \"novel disease genes\".\n\n\"Variant Spark lets you find the complex links in the genome,\" Dr Bauer said.\n\n\"There is something called the GUS catalogue, which is an accumulation of all the genomic data for different diseases and we want to re-analyse that resource with Variant Spark because in the past, you could only pick one gene that impacted a disease, but it might be the case that gene X communicates with gene Y and that informs the disease.\"\n\nWhile some researchers dismiss the idea that diseases might be influenced by the relations between genes, Dr Bauer believes it is simply a case that in the past the technology hasn't existed to interrogate the data correctly.\n\n\"This is what research should be like \u2013 developing tools that we can share around the world to let us stand on each other's shoulders to build something bigger,\" she said.\n\nVariant Spark is the first of a pipeline of products CSIRO is planning to commercialise on the AWS marketplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next in line is Ontoserver \u2013 a smart technology server that lets health management systems store and share patient information.\n\nIt is free to license for all Australian private and public health organisations, but will be sold overseas.\n\nAWS public sector country manager for Australia and New Zealand Iain Rouse said CSIRO's use of the AWS marketplace to share genomic data was \"pioneering\".\n\n\"It will help to accelerate research and achieve faster results in crucial areas such as improving healthcare. Digital marketplaces will continue to enable small and large Australian organisations to innovate and go global quicker,\u201d he said.", "description": "CSIRO is the first public sector organisation globally to sell a health product via Amazon Web Services, targeting research in conditions like diabetes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3064%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_353/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4366755add178ed3d71c8bb26be7f0affc1ff781", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
