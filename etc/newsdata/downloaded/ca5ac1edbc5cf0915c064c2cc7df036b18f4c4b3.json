Nodoka Kikuchi reckons it was somewhere right around the halfway line. She\u2019d know. She was the last person to ever use it. That was at a 2.45pm on 11 March 2011. She was 15, had just got out of high school, and was calling her parents to come and pick her up. A minute later, the great earthquake struck. \u201cIt started to shake from side-to-side,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was terrible, I was holding on to the box, and my friend outside was hugging a gate, because it was the only way we could stand up.\u201d Behind them, the earth of the school football pitch split open and water started to spray out of the ground \u201clike a fountain\u201d.\n\nRugby fans allowed own food in World Cup venues after shortages Read more\n\nLike all the children at Kamaishi High, and the next door Unosumai Elementary too, Nodoka knew exactly what to do. They were all supposed to meet at the evacuation point in schoolyard so the teachers could take a head count. But as she hurried there she heard one teacher shout: \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to count! We should just run away!\u201d And that\u2019s what they did, all 570 of them, up into the mountains behind the school.\n\nThey stopped at an old people\u2019s home 800m uphill. The teachers were talking about what to do next when the aftershocks started. Rocks and boulders were tumbling down on them from the mountain so they ran again, hand in hand now, big kids paired with little kids, 300m further on, to the car park of a day care centre. The road was narrow, and they had to squeeze beside the cars coming up from the seafront. \u201cThere were about 600 people here, I was in the middle and I could see the people at the back didn\u2019t have room to run in so I was shouting: \u2018Making room! Run! Run! Please run!\u201d\n\nWhen they reached the car park, the teachers started another count. And that\u2019s when Nodoka heard what she thought was a helicopter. Only she couldn\u2019t understand why the whirring sound seemed to be coming up from all around, above and below and behind. Then she looked back.\n\n\u201cTsunami means wave, but it\u2019s not a wave, I mean, that\u2019s not what I saw. What I saw was like a great wall moving towards us.\u201d Everyone fell silent. \u201cThen someone shouted \u2018tsunami!\u2019 and I realised what it was.\u201d They wanted to run higher, right up into the forests, but the ground was shaking now, and they were worried the mountains were going to fall down, just like the sea had risen up. The teachers led them safely to the highway instead, and they began the long walk inland. Two schoolchildren died. One, a friend of Nodoka\u2019s, had stayed home, sick, and another had been collected by their parents. But everyone who stayed with the teachers survived.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nodoka Kikuchi.

Over 160 of the deaths were at the Unosumai District Disaster Control Centre, three minutes walk from Nodoka\u2019s school. Many of the dead there had taken part in a tsunami drill just the previous week, but it had been so cold then that, instead of heading up the mountain where they were supposed to go, they\u2019d stayed indoors at the Centre instead. When the tsunami came, that\u2019s what they did again. The flood there was 11m deep.\n\nIn the years afterwards, they would call what happened at Nodoka\u2019s school \u201cthe miracle of Kamaishi\u201d. But she and her friends have never liked to that name. \u201cA miracle,\u201d says her colleague Miyuki Kanie, \u201cwould have saved everyone.\u201d And besides, she adds, it wasn\u2019t an act of God that got them through it. The children lived because their teachers made the right decisions. And the townspeople have carved that lesson in stone at the new Tsunami memorial. \u201cJust run! Run uphill! Don\u2019t worry about others. Save yourself first. And tell the future generations that a tsunami once reached this point, and that those who survived were those who ran.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmiracle of Kamaishi\u201d has become a famous story, one which has been repeated over and again in the media here. They even made a film about it. It\u2019s one of those tales we tell each other for succour, because it allows us to believe in hope and mercy where there isn\u2019t any. And in that way it\u2019s similar to how we\u2019ll talk about the new rugby ground they\u2019ve built on the site of those two old schools, the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium. From our remove, flying in for these few days, the two World Cup matches that will be played here \u2013 Fiji face Uruguay on Wednesday\u2013 seem a powerful symbol of Kamaishi\u2019s redevelopment. But this isn\u2019t our story to tell.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A fishing boat rests surrounded by debris in Kamaishi in the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami.

But to tell the truth, young people are not so interested.\u201d It\u2019s a fact, she says, that the recovery has moved more quickly here than elsewhere because the World Cup has spurred it on. There are only around 20 local families left in temporary accommodation, and they will be rehoused by the end of the year. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think many people were against the idea of the World Cup,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause of that, and because they knew how important rugby was to Kamaishi. It has given people new energy. But I know some kids have complicated feelings about it.\u201d\n\nNodoka is one of them. \u201cWhen I heard the stadium was being built I was shocked,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it felt like they were destroying my memories. I had such complicated feelings then, thinking about our school, and our lives, it was a big loss.\u201d Over time, though, as she has watched the construction work, that has changed. \u201cWhile I watched the stadium going up I started to digest all my feelings, the sadness, the guilt, the nostalgia. And I feel like they\u2019ve settled now. It\u2019s all passed. It\u2019s just part of my history, of who I am. And I feel like if they hadn\u2019t destroyed the school to make this new stadium, I never would have gone through that.\u201d", "description": "Kamaishi, the small town in which 1,000 people died in the 2011 tsunami, welcomes the Rugby World Cup on Tuesday", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25664d5e6360d00b4cd042d285bcfa6ee19cb96/0_86_5294_3176/master/5294.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b2c40bf22ef34fa2d9e07b3cc9c73c77", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
