Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe news about Martinez came from general manager Mike Rizzo, who spoke to the media in St. Louis on Monday before the Nationals opened a key series against the Cardinals.\n\nThe team previously announced that Martinez, 54, did not join the club on its trip to St. Louis, opting to remain in the nation\u2019s capital for precautionary medical testing. He first left the club Sunday in the sixth inning of Washington\u2019s 7-0 win over the Atlanta Braves, and he was hospitalized due to chest pains.\n\nMartinez wound up having a cardiac catheterization, and he will remain in Washington for additional testing, according to Rizzo. \u201cThis is something we have to take care of,\u201d Rizzo said, according to the Washington Post, adding that Martinez was \u201cupbeat.\u201d\n\n\u2014Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo must wear a boot five to seven days to immobilize a moderate-lateral right ankle sprain and then be re-evaluated, the team said.\n\n\u201cI have every intention of doing everything I can, with the training staff, to be back on the field with the boys,\u201d Rizzo told reporters before the Cubs played a home game against the Cincinnati Reds on Monday night. \u201cI think in a few days, really, will tell us a lot more.\u201d\n\nX-rays didn\u2019t reveal a fracture, so surgery is not required. Rizzo, who also underwent an MRI, suffered the injury in the top of the third inning of Sunday\u2019s victory over the Pirates. His ankle turned while charging a bunt attempt by Pirates pitcher Trevor Williams. He fell to the ground after making the play, and was replaced at first base by Ian Happ.\n\n\u2014Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich said he has accepted his season-ending injury and was ready to support his teammates in their fight for a posteason berth. Yelich suffered a fractured right kneecap when fouling off a pitch in the first inning at Miami on Sept. 10.\n\n\u201cIt was the worst pain I ever felt in my life,\u201d said Yelich, speaking to reporters for the first time since the injury. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nThe reigning National League Most Valuable Player underwent X-rays at Marlins Park after leaving the field, and knew his kneecap was broken. \u201cThe timing of it is very unfortunate; it sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to be one of those things that\u2019s not fair at the moment. Trust me, I had my pity party that night at the stadium. I felt terrible. I was down in the dumps. After leaving the stadium and getting going, it\u2019s all about being positive and trying to get back.\u201d\n\n\u2014David Ortiz said he feared the worst after being shot in the Dominican Republic in early June.\n\n\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t going to be able to be who I am right now and go back to normal, you know? At some point, I started losing hope,\u201d the former Boston Red Sox slugger told MLB.com.\n\n\u201c(Doctors) discovered that this bullet gave me a bacteria that they had never seen before,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cThey had this team, antibacteria team. They were really on me, hard, because they want to get this out of my body. The reality is that they did, but they fought with it. The reason why they went in the third time is because the bacteria had my intestine all kinked. It wasn\u2019t able to function.\u201d\n\n\u2014President Donald Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to record-setting reliever Mariano Rivera. The longtime New York Yankees closer received the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor two months after he entered the famed Cooperstown museum as the first unanimously elected Hall of Famer.\n\n\u201cHe is the most dominant relief pitcher in the history of baseball, and more than that, he has lived the American dream and shines as an example of American greatness for all to see,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRivera, 49, earned a record 652 saves over 19 seasons with the Yankees (1995-2013). He made 13 All-Star teams and won five World Series championships in the Bronx.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Nationals manager Dave Martinez underwent a heart procedure Monday in Washington, and it was uncertain when he will be able to rejoin the team.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430645643&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G00A-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
