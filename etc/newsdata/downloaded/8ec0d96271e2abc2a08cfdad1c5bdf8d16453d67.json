Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nThe Liberal Party is expected to form an alliance with the New Democrat Party (NDP) headed by Jagmeet Singh. The NDP won 24 seats, while the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won 32.\n\nThe results meant a loss of 20 seats for the Liberals and a gain of 26 for the Conservatives. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois gained 22 seats, while the NDP lost 15. The Liberals lost the nationwide popular vote but fared much better on a seat-by-seat basis than most projections, while the NDP performed well below its popularity as suggested by polls.\n\nConservative leader Andrew Scheer portrayed Trudeau\u2019s close re-election victory as a warning to the prime minister and his party.\n\n\u201cTonight Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice. And Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win,\u201d said Scheer.\n\n\u201cWhile tonight\u2019s result isn\u2019t what we wanted, I\u2019m also incredibly proud, proud of our team and proud of the bigger and stronger Conservative team that we\u2019ll send to Ottawa,\u201d he told Conservative Party supporters after the results came in.\n\nTwo of the key figures from the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal that dogged Trudeau, until his blackface scandal eclipsed all other news, were running in the election. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general forced out of her position and expelled from the Liberal Party by Trudeau and his allies after she refused to kill an investigation of SNC-Lavalin, retained the seat she won as an independent in the previous election.\n\nJane Philpott, who resigned from Trudeau\u2019s cabinet to protest Wilson-Raybould\u2019s ouster and was also booted from the Liberal Party, lost her seat.\n\nCBC News summed up the election results by saying Scheer \u201cwas able to tap into the palpable anger in Western Canada,\u201d where Trudeau\u2019s policies have hindered oil and gas development, but he \u201cfailed to sway enough independent-minded voters in Central and Eastern Canada.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Conservative Party made gains and won the national popular vote, CBC expected Scheer\u2019s failure to deliver victory at a moment of great vulnerability for Trudeau could spell the end of his party leadership.\n\n\u201cWhile Trudeau\u2019s campaign was beset by scandal, Scheer also faced questions about his resume and his political positions. Scheer appeared awkward when asked about social issues like gay marriage and abortion. There were also questions about his past as an insurance broker (he was never actually licensed to sell insurance) and his dual Canada-U.S. citizenship,\u201d CBC noted.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal party were narrowly returned and now preside over a minority government.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/02/justin-trudeau.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
