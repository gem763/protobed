That in itself doesn\u2019t make it true.\n\nThere are, after all, other stories Biden\u2019s been telling for years that don\u2019t add up. But this one, against all odds, looks solid in its basic details.\n\nGo watch the clip of him telling it if you missed it yesterday. Political Twitter, me included, spent much of Saturday and Sunday guffawing at the details. A black gangster named \u2026 \u201cCorn Pop\u201d? Head of a gang called \u201cthe Romans\u201d? And Biden, armed with a six-foot length of chain, somehow talked the guy into not stabbing him after tempers flared at a public pool? Michael Harriot of The Root led the parade of mockery, tweeting at length about the absurdity of the details. This was obviously a case of an old white politician concocting a too-good-to-check story about how he was so progressive-minded even as a youth that he was able to make friends with black gang members.\n\nJust one thing: It looks like Biden\u2019s telling the truth. The detail about the chain remains uncorroborated but all the rest of it \u2014 Corn Pop, the Romans, the pool, some sort of altercation followed by reconciliation \u2014 has been vouched for by others.\n\nFormer Wilmington mayor Dennis Williams tells me this is the CornPop of the Biden incident. He says he grew up across the courtyard from CornPop in a housing project. He says CornPop, \"real as the moon in the sky,\" was confrontational as a young man. \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 15, 2019\n\nIf Morris was 73 when he died in 2016, he would have been right around Biden\u2019s age when the alleged near-fight occurred in the early 1960s. How about the Romans? Surely Biden cribbed that from some young-adult fiction he read long ago about gangs, right? Nope \u2014 also real, notes Dale.\n\nSome of the skepticism has been about the name of the gang or crew Biden said CornPop ran with, the Romans. Here\u2019s an article from Delaware\u2019s News Journal in which a local historian says there was a Wilmington gang called the Romans in the 1960s. pic.twitter.com/A4ePc4hnDX \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 15, 2019\n\nDale also points to this 2010 post at The Root, Harriot\u2019s own website, for further corroboration:\n\nFor starters, nearly everyone [in Wilmington] calls [Biden] by his first name. My dad, a retired federal parole officer, and his friends, many of whom hung out at the city pool back in the day, regularly rattle off stories about \u201cJoe.\u201d They\u2019d likely seen him at a community event when he was still a senator. Several of them attended fundraisers at his house or called his office to air grievances. But the Corn Pop run-in, which the vice president also recounts in his autobiography, Promises to Keep, is the one story they keep in heavy rotation.\n\nI noted in yesterday\u2019s post that Richard \u201cMouse\u201d Smith, a friend of Biden\u2019s who frequented the same pool and went on to become the president of Delaware\u2019s NAACP, also remembered Biden getting into it with Corn Pop one day. He showed up in a WaPo story from this past summer, after Biden\u2019s \u201cbusing\u201d exchange with Kamala Harris at the first primary debate, recounting his impression of Biden as a young white lifeguard at a city pool in a black neighborhood. And he wasn\u2019t the only one:\n\nThey loved pranking Biden. The cost to enter the pool was 10 cents, but a tiny, smack-talking teenager known as Corn Pop wanted to try a way to get his friends in free: distract the white lifeguard. Corn Pop got Biden\u2019s attention by talking about his mother, Smith recalled. Biden blew his whistle and demanded Corn Pop show him some respect. Meanwhile, Corn Pop\u2019s friends jumped the fence, hopped into the water and laughed over their declared victory. \u201cThey were testing him,\u201d recalled Maurice Pritchett, known as Marty, who served as a lifeguard on the shift with Biden. \u201cHe had to earn their respect.\u201d\u2026 Eventually, Pritchett said, he earned their respect by continuing to show up. He learned some witty cut-downs to master the art of \u201cplaying the dozens,\u201d discovering that some good yo\u2019 mama jokes could be more disarming than blowing a whistle. Soon, he was playing basketball with the Romans when his shift ended, and others were inviting him to dinner. He\u2019d stay until dark and, sometimes, the kids would push the used car he borrowed from his father up the hill so he could get home.\n\nThe sonofabitch was telling the truth! Or most of it, anyway. Biden left out the detail in his story about Corn Pop being \u201ctiny,\u201d and I assume it\u2019s as likely that he peed himself and Corn Pop took pity on him than that Biden really did threaten to wrap a chain around Corn Pop\u2019s head. But the basics all appear to check out. Time for some people to apologize to Grandpa Simpson for doubting him on this one.\n\nNah, I\u2019m just kidding. No one\u2019s going to apologize. The narrative has already moved on from \u201cBiden is obviously lying about this encounter to impress a naive white audience\u201d to \u201cBiden might be telling the truth but it\u2019s problematic that he thinks this story says something important about his relationship with African-Americans.\u201d The progressive critique that he\u2019s been no friend to black people in his political career, be it on busing or the 1990s crime bill, requires that a charming story about a youthful Biden befriending black people at a time when interracial friendships were uncommon has to be used against him somehow. If Harriot\u2019s suspicion that Biden is a BS artist can\u2019t be weaponized against the former VP, the truth will be.", "description": "What?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jb-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
