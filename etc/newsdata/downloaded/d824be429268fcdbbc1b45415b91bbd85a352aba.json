Fed Minutes, Powell on Watch\n\nThe September Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's participation in a Kansas City Fed event will likely be the main focus ahead of a widely-expected Fed rate cut later this month.\n\nPowell\u2019s at 11:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT) and the 2 p.m. ET release of the from its September meeting will be closely watched for clues into the central bank\u2019s thinking.\n\nIn a Tuesday speech, Powell said the Fed is going to sell some short-term securities to shore up some funding issues in short-term debt markets. He also said the economy was growing nicely and not overheating.\n\nIn its September meeting, the FOMC delivered what many saw as a hawkish cut as the central bank signaled that it was unlikely to adopt a prolonged period of easing.\n\nThe odds of Fed rate cut have cooled recently, but remained high, with 77% of traders expecting a cut later this month, according to Investing.com\u2019s .\n\n\u201cWe expect one more 25 basis point rate cut, most likely in October, as the FOMC navigates a U.S. economy that is slowing and facing elevated downside risks,\u201d Nomura said in a recent note to clients.\n\n2. Labor Market Data Due\n\nBeyond monetary policy, labor market data will also garner attention following last week\u2019s weaker-than-expected, but solid, employment report.\n\nThe Labor Department will release its August Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).\n\nOn average, economists expect that fell to 7.19 million in August from 7.22 million the prior month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.\n\n3. Crude Inventories to Build for Fourth-Straight Week?\n\nThe petroleum report, due Wednesday, will likely provide a timely distraction as crude prices have pressured by rising fears that U.S.-China trade talks set to start Thursday are unlikely to lead to meaningful progress.\n\nThe EIA is expected to report a build in crude stockpiles of 1.41 million barrels last week. That would mark the fourth-weekly build in crude stockpiles.\n\nU.S. weekly production, which remains at a record of 12.4 million barrels a day, will likely also attract attention.\n\nsettled down 0.2% to $52.63 a barrel on Tuesday and were at levels last seen in mid-August.", "description": "Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEEAJ00C_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
