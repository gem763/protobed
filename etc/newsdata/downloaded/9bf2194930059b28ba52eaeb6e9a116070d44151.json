Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Lee Zeldin took a break from the interview to tell reporters Mr. Volker\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t match up with the \u201cnarrative\u201d coming from the pro-impeachment camp.\n\n\u201cMr. Volker has been very impressive \u2026 and has said nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 that coincides with what the Democrats are saying,\u201d Mr. Jordan, Ohio Republican, said.\n\nAnother Ohio congressman, Rep. Mike Turner, was the first Republican to speak out on the interview, saying it offered no help to Democrats.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that Volker\u2019s testimony advanced [Rep. Adam B.] Schiff\u2019s impeachment agenda,\u201d Mr. Turner said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, remained mum as they emerged from the room where Mr. Volker had been testifying behind closed doors.\n\nMr. Schiff, the House Intelligence chairman, had no update on the ongoing interview, only stopping to address the president\u2019s comments about asking Ukraine and China to investigate the family of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nMr. Schiff said those comments were clear that the only thing the president has learned after the two years of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe is that \u201che feels he can do anything with impunity.\u201d\n\nReps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Gerald Connolly of Virginia both declined to comment to reporters as they exited the room.\n\nRepublicans, too, were mum on details.\n\nMr. Meadows couldn\u2019t say what sorts of questions were going on behind closed doors, but he sounded optimistic.\n\n\u201cI think anytime you can get clarity to what actually happened is a good day for Americans. And we\u2019re getting more clarity,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Volker has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry, which has gained steam since the release of a whistleblower complaint detailing President Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe complaint describes how Mr. Trump prodded Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Mr. Biden, the Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son Hunter.\n\nMr. Volker resigned last week after the State Department confirmed he connected the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani with a top Zelensky adviser. Mr. Giuliani has also said he was in frequent contact with Mr. Volker.\n\nThe first hour of questioning Thursday was led by Mr. Schiff\u2019s staff. Mr. Turner said the longtime diplomat handed the questioning \u201cwith a legacy of integrity.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also took the opportunity to bash Mr. Schiff for his conduct of Mr. Volker\u2019s deposition.\n\nMr. Jordan accused the leading Democrat of trying to block some members from participating in the interview.\n\n\u201cIf this is how Mr. Schiff is going to conduct these types of interviews in the future, that\u2019s a concern as well,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Turner also blasted the Ukraine investigation, ramped up by Mr. Schiff of California, and other top Democrats. He said it undercut Mr. Volker\u2019s ability to work with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply unfortunate and regrettable that Schiff\u2019s show trial investigation has clearly affected Volker\u2019s ability to advance U.S. interests with Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cIt is my strong belief that Volker would not have been involved in nor permitted anything inappropriate.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
