We\u2019re limiting the competition to 500 participants and seats are going fast. Don\u2019t miss your chance to put your creative skills to the test and compete against some of the world\u2019s top code poets.\n\nOh, you\u2019ll love this part \u2014 it won\u2019t cost you anything to apply or to participate. Who doesn\u2019t love free? Apply to the TC Hackathon today.\n\nOur Hackathon will push you to be your very best. Here\u2019s how it works. The event takes place during the Disrupt conference in a dedicated section of Arena Berlin and \u2014 how cool is this \u2014 all participants receive a free Innovator pass to the show.\n\nYou and your team (either the one you bring or the one you find onsite) will choose from a series of sponsored challenges (more on that in a minute). Then buckle up and get ready to buckle down, because you\u2019ll have less than 24 hours to design, build and present something great. We\u2019re talking working prototypes that address real-world problems.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll keep you fed and caffeinated throughout the competition so you can focus on building a product with the potential to change the way we live, work and play \u2014 and thus dazzle the judges with your skill and creativity.\n\nThe Hackathon judges review every completed project, and they\u2019ll pick only 10 teams to move into the finals. That final round takes place on day two, and each team gets a mere two minutes to pitch and impress \u2014 in front of judges and an appreciative crowd \u2014 on the Extra Crunch stage.\n\nSponsors present a variety of prizes (including cash) to the winners of their specific challenges, and then TechCrunch chooses one team as the best over-all hack \u2014 and awards them a $5,000 prize.\n\nWe\u2019ll announce the sponsors, challenges and prizes in the coming weeks. But for now, the sponsored contests, prizes and winners from the Hackathon at Disrupt SF 2018 will give you an idea of what you can expect. You can also check out Quick Insurance \u2014 the overall winner at the Disrupt Berlin 2017 Hackathon.\n\nThe TC Hackathon takes place during Disrupt Berlin 2019 on 11-12 December. Only 500 people will make the cut and seats are filling quickly. Come show us your tech skills and build something awesome. Apply to the Hackathon today.\n\nIs your company interested in sponsoring or exhibiting at Disrupt Berlin 2019?
