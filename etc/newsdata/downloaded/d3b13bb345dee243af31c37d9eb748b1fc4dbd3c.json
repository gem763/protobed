(AP) - Joaquin Niemann became the first player from Chile to win on the PGA Tour, shooting a 6-under 64 on Sunday for a six-stroke victory in A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier.\n\nThe 20-year-old Niemann entered the final round of the season opener with a two-stroke lead and held off challenges from Tom Hoge and Richy Werenski.\n\nNiemann birdied the final three holes to finish at 21-under 259 at Old White TPC.\n\nHoge shot 65 and finished second at 15 under. Werenski faded to a 69 and tied for third at 14 under with Brian Harman (65), Harris English (67) and Nate Lashley (69).\n\nIt marks the first year since 1931 that there has been more than one tour winner under 21. Matthew Wolff won the 3M Open in June at 20 years, 2 months.\n\nNiemann will give International Team captain Ernie Els something to think about when he makes his captain\u2019s picks for the Presidents Cup in December.\n\nHe\u2019s the first third-round leader to win at The Greenbrier since its debut in 2010.\n\nNiemann made a short birdie putt on the par-4 10th to forge ahead for good. He saved par from 6 feet at No. 11, made birdie putts of 9 feet at No. 12 and a curling 13-footer at No. 13 that prompted a fist pump to push his lead to four.\n\nNiemann grew up in Santiago, Chile, won a pair of junior world titles and was the No. 1 ranked amateur in the world before turning pro in 2018. He played his first full season on tour in 2019, finishing No. 67 in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nIn 2017, Niemann tied for 29th as an amateur after receiving a sponsor\u2019s exemption at The Greenbrier. He improved to a tie for fifth in 2018. He shot 64 in the final round for the third straight year.\n\nHoge fell short in another chance at an elusive first win. At the 2018 Sony Open, he lost a one-shot lead with three holes to play, finished third and missed a playoff.\n\nHoge birdied five of his first eight holes Sunday, then birdied the 568-yard 12th hole to temporarily join Niemann at 16 under before making bogeys on two of his next three holes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joaquin Niemann became the first player from Chile to win on the PGA Tour, shooting a 6-under 64 on Sunday for a six-stroke victory in A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Raby", "John Ra"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/greenbrier_golf_15870_c0-137-3285-2052_s1770x1032.jpg?0bad88ebf20d1b758762c10b23b5646b6d2db7ce", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
