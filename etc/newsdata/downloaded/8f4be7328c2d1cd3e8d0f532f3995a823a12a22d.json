I told him that can\u2019t happen. \u2026 I remember I kept telling him, \u2018We cannot allow that to happen!\u2019\n\n\u201cI actually told Steve jokingly that if that happens, we\u2019re moving the team to Seattle. It was a joke, but I was actually serious about it. I really believed that.\u201d\n\nKawhi Leonard cost us the SuperSonics returning!\n\nI don\u2019t know how serious Rivers really was. Leonard joining LeBron James and Anthony Davis on their cross-arena rival would\u2019ve been disastrous for the Clippers.\n\nI\u2019m convinced Ballmer will keep the franchise in Los Angeles. Ballmer\u2019s ties to Seattle through Microsoft are well-established, and he previously tried to buy the Kings to move them to Seattle. But I can\u2019t see him moving the Clippers from such a prime market, especially after going so far to get a new arena built in L.A. At every turn, he has maintained he\u2019ll keep the team in Los Angeles.\n\nThen again, Ballmer also phrased that guarantee as, \u201cI will die owning the L.A. Clippers.\u201d Now, he\u2019s open to changing the nickname. Hmmm\u2026\n\nTo be clearer than Rivers: That\u2019s a joke I\u2019m not actually serious about don\u2019t really believe.", "description": "We know what happened: The Clippers traded for Paul George, signed Kawhi Leonard and became championship favorites.
