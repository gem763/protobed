I thought the criticism of commissioner Silver and LeBron James was unfair. Daryl Morey \u2014 who I like \u2014 he can say whatever he wants to. But there are consequences. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why these holier-than-thou politicians \u2014 if they\u2019re so worried about China, why don\u2019t they stop all transactions with China? President Trump has been talking about and arguing with tariffs for China for the last two years. I think it\u2019s unfair for them to do all their business in China and just because this thing happens try to make the NBA and our players look bad. All American companies do business in China. Period.\u201d\n\nBarkley\u2019s stance on China\n\nBarkley made his stance on the controversy clear on Monday, expressing sympathy for James and other NBA athletes under fire for either remaining silent on the issue or speaking critically of Morey, who tweeted support of Hong Kong protesters in their ongoing conflict with an oppressive Chinese regime.\n\nCharles Barkley took full advantage of his right to free speech to take on Vice President Mike Pence. (Rich Fury/Getty Images)\n\nJames attacked Morey\u2019s tweet as misinformed in his first public statement on the issue that prioritized his and the NBA\u2019s business interests in China over freedom of expression concerns and the plight of the people of Hong Kong. Barkley, a Nike spokesman who has his own business interests related to China, spoke bluntly about the reality of those business concerns in an interview with TMZ.\n\n\u201cI thought everybody was really unfair to LeBron,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cEverybody does business in China. Every American company does business in China. Why should LeBron not be able to protect his financial interests \u2014 and the NBA and Nike?\u201d\n\nShaq has different take\n\nBarkley\u2019s TNT set-mate and frequent antagonist Shaquille O\u2019Neal took a different stance on Wednesday, choosing to focus on free speech concerns while supporting Morey.\n\nShaq on Daryl Morey/China \"One of our best values here in America is free speech we're allowed to say what we want to say and we are allowed to speak out on injustices and that's just how it goes. and if people don't understand that that's something they have to deal with. pic.twitter.com/vefcHSPlMD \u2014 gifdsports (@gifdsports) October 22, 2019\n\n\"One of our best values here in America is free speech,\u201d O\u2019Neal said on TNT. \u201cWe're allowed to say what we want to say, and we\u2019re allowed to speak out on injustices, and that's just how it goes. And if people don\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s something they have to deal with. \u201cDaryl Morey was right. Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say 'that's not right' and that's what he did.\u201d\n\nAs the debate over freedom of expression roils on, Barkley and O\u2019Neal continue to take full advantage of their platforms to speak freely.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Charles Barkley took full advantage of his right to free speech to take on Vice President Mike Pence.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.nsNoF4Ys3g1zyPjQcF_7Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qVeELAWE1U6pffYygC_gNw--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/d2328cc0-f6c1-11e9-bbdb-88993ea54af4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
