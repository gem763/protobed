REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser\n\nThe United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia have blamed the attack on Iran, instead of the Yemeni Iran-aligned Houthi group that claimed responsibility. Iran distanced itself from the attacks, but said it was ready for \u201cfull-fledged\u201d war.\n\n\u201cThis cannot go unanswered, there has to be consequences for Iran for what they did,\u201d Jubeir told a United Against Nuclear Iran conference.\n\nThe attack on the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry damaged the world\u2019s biggest petroleum-processing facility and knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations sent people to be part of the investigation, other countries have sent experts to be part of the investigation,\u201d Jubeir told reporters earlier on Wednesday on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cWhen the team that\u2019s investigating has concluded its investigations we will make the announcements publicly,\u201d he said.\n\nU.N. experts monitoring Security Council sanctions on Iran and Yemen traveled to Saudi Arabia days after the attack. But their reports to the U.N. Security Council are not due until December and January respectively.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reports twice a year to the Security Council on the implementation of an arms embargo on Iran and other restrictions that remained in place after Tehran agreed a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015.\n\nA separate independent panel also reports twice a year to the U.N. Security Council on the implementation of sanctions related to the conflict in Yemen that were imposed in 2014 and 2015.\n\nFrance also sent seven military experts to investigate this weekend\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil facilities, including specialists in explosives, missile trajectory and ground-to-air defense systems, a defense ministry spokeswoman has said.", "description": "Saudi Arabia is in consultation \"with friends and allies about the next steps to take\" after a Sept. 14 attack on its oil facilities, but is waiting for the findings of an investigation, Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir told reporters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433896126&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O21Y", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
