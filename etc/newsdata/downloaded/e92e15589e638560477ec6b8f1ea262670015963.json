But their performances in Japan have got increasingly worse as the tournament has gone on, and with a winner-takes-all encounter against rivals England scheduled on Saturday, the French camp appears to be in disarray once again.\n\nEight years after a player coup took France from pool-stage calamity in losing to Tonga to the World Cup final, French newspaper Midi Olympique has reported a fallout between Guirado and the senior staff that includes head coach Jacques Brunel and assistant Fabien Galthie, who is set to replace Brunel after the World Cup. It adds that the row could spread to the rest of the squad given that Guirado remains \u201cthe players\u2019 captain\u201d, but Jefferson Poirot seems certain to skipper Les Bleus against England this weekend.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Our team spirit is almost non-existent,\u201d Boudjellal said. \u201cIndividually, we have players who are world class. Collectively, for several years, that hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Rugby World Cup 2019 best pictures Show all 35 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Take control guys, because it is your history, your World Cup.\n\n\u201cYou are there for your career and for your country. You are there for French rugby and to try to go as far as possible, to see if you can win this World Cup \u2013 but we will only get there if you take control.\n\n\u201cJapan is a magnificent country to visit. Out coaches who are there, I invite you to visit Japan, go and look around, treat yourself and leave the players to tell their own stories because for years I have not understood the game plan of this France team.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t understand. Something is going wrong, so it\u2019s over to you guys [the players]. Tell the coaches to go on holiday. Write your story yourself.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of experience, there are guys in this group who will certainly be major coaches in the future, so start to be a big coach today. Start today, kick the coaches out, take control, tell your own story, because we are ready to follow you.\u201d\n\nBrunel looks set to stick with Racing 92 hooker Camille Chat ahead of Guirado for the Pool C decider against England.", "description": "The French rugby squad is on the cusp of an all-too-familiar civil war at the Rugby World Cup\u00a0ahead of \u2018Le Crunch\u2019 against England, following a stunning outburst from Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal and report captain Guilhem Guirado has been ousted from his role by the senior management.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/14/france-chaos.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
