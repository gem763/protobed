She reported that EMS was responding. She also said that more calls of more shooting were coming in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a shooter,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got shots fired on the line, 911.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have an active shooter?\u201d a cop inquired.\n\n\u201cThe shooter left in a vehicle, Toyota, westbound on I-20,\u201d the dispatcher replied.\n\n\u201cWhat is the status of the trooper?\u201d another cop inquired.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working on the trooper right now,\u201d somebody radioed from the scene. \u201cHe is talking and responsive. They\u2019re going to transport the trooper.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher repeated, \u201cShooter in a Toyota headed westbound,\u201d adding, \u201ctoward Odessa.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher then announced, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a gunshot victim at marker 126.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have EMS on that one too?\u201d somebody inquired.\n\nWest Texas Shooting Spree Leaves 4 Dead, Injures 21; Gunman Killed in Shoot\n\nA second ambulance was indeed on the way to mile marker 126 as the wounded trooper was loaded into the first one at mile marker 131.\n\n\u201cThey're transporting the trooper to the Memorial now,\u201d the dispatcher said meaning Midland Memorial Hospital. \u201cThe trooper is en route to the ER.\u201d\n\nSomebody asked the status of the other gunshot victim.\n\n\u201cHe was shot in the gut, left lower gut,\u201d a cop at the scene reported. \u201cTroopers are working on him right now.\u201d\n\nMore reports of more shooting were coming in and one of the emergency response operators was apparently having trouble keeping up\n\n\u201cDispatch... we have multiple lines, multiple gunshot victims. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d\n\nA field supervisor warned the responding paramedics over the air, \u201cEMS...Make sure you got your vest handy.\u201d\n\nGangs often do drive-by shootings and there have been serial shooters who periodically fire at random motorists one or two at a time. But this was a mass shooter committing mayhem on the move.\n\n\u201cWe have an active shooter on the interstate,\u201d a cop said.\n\nA moment later, the dispatcher reported, \u201cThere's another gunshot victim at mile marker 125.\u201d\n\nAnd then, \u201cGot another gunshot victim at 129.

A cop reported on a truck driver who had been found beyond saving.\n\n\u201cGunshot wound to the head of this victim in his 18- wheeler,\u201d the cop reported. \u201cHe is DOS [dead on the scene.]\u201d\n\nThe cop advised, \u201cThere is a gentleman going up and down the interstate right now shooting people.
