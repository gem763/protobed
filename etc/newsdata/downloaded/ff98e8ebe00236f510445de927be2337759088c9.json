He told King that as a celebrity, he has protections other people don\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cMe being in this position, it\u2019s easy for me,\u201d he said about coming out to his fans after the release of his now record-breaking \u201cOld Town Road\u201d with Billy Ray Cyrus. \u201cBut some little boys ... 10 miles from here ... in the hood ... it\u2019s not going to be good for him,\u201d he said.\n\nLil Nas X said he struggled as a boy with accepting his sexuality in the face of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and the history of discrimination.
