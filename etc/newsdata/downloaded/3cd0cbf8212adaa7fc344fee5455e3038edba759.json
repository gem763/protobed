However, he said he was conscious that the league should be the club\u2019s priority.\n\n\u201cThe Champions League is something special and we all want to win it, but we are conscious that the Liga is the most important.\n\n\u201cLa Liga can help you reach the Champions League and the Copa del Rey. It is very difficult if you don\u2019t perform well in the Liga to compete in the Champions League.\n\n\u201cWe never forget about the Liga and the Copa because we are Barcelona and we always aim to win everything.\u201d\n\nBarca have endured a difficult start to the season, losing twice in their first eight league games. They have won their last three matches to pull themselves into second place on 16 points, two behind leaders Real Madrid.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Barcelona forward Lionel Messi picked up a record-extending sixth - and third consecutive - European Golden Shoe award on Wednesday following his outstanding individual 2018-19 domestic campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Messi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
