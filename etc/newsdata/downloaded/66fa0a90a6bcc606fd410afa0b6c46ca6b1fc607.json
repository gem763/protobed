(Jason DeCrow)\n\nGreta Thunberg is \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Emma Gonz\u00e1lez is a \u201cskinhead lesbian.\u201d David Hogg is \u201ca special kind of stupid.\u201d\n\nThese may sound like playground taunts, but they\u2019re not: all are epithets applied by politicians, pundits or political elites (adults) to the young leaders of global movements against climate change and gun violence. Fox News guest Michael Knowles offered the first observation; the second came from Leslie Gibson, a former Republican candidate for the Maine State House (who dropped out because of the remark); and Virginia Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, delivered the third.\n\nThunberg is 16, and Gonzalez and Hogg are in their late teens.\n\nThis kind of rhetoric, experts say, is the hallmark of a new era of American political discourse: One that allows \u2014 even encourages \u2014 vitriolic verbal abuse of children and teenagers.\n\n\u201cThere used to be a constraint upon criticizing children, generally,\u201d said Lawrence Prelli, a University of New Hampshire professor who studies political discourse. \u201cThese vile attacks now are a sign of the times... when I look back into the past, it\u2019s really hard to find examples beyond this recent period.\u201d\n\n[A Fox News guest called Greta Thunberg 'mentally ill.' The network apologized for the 'disgraceful' comment.]\n\nJustin B. Richland, a University of California at Irvine professor and anthropologist who studies language, said he finds the trend troubling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paying attention it, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about it,\u201d Richland said. \u201cThis particular moment has just become so piqued for this.\u201d\n\nHe and other analysts had a variety of theories for how the country arrived at a place where it\u2019s par for the course for Fox News host Laura Ingraham to suggest Thunberg and other youth climate activists are \u201cbrainwashed,\u201d evil and demented \u2014 or for President Trump to mock the 16-year-old to his almost 65 million followers on Twitter.\n\nBut young liberal activists are not the only targets of this type of heated rhetoric \u2014 conservative figures have drawn fire, too. Notably, a former Republican representative compared pro-gun rights Parkland shooting survivor Kyle Kashuv to a school shooter; and 16-year-old Nick Sandmann earned denunciations from a wide range of prominent figures after he took part in a widely publicized confrontation with an American Indian activist at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nIn part, it\u2019s because young people are more prominent and politically active today than at any other moment in recent history, Prenelli said. The fact that both the campaigns against climate change and gun violence are being led \u201cfront and center\u201d by teenagers \u2014 and involve scores of young people as rank-and-file members \u2014 is \u201cunusual\u201d to say the least, according to Prenelli.\n\n\n\nDavid Hogg of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School speaks during the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday, March 24, 2018, in Washington. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nRose McDermott, a Brown University professor who studies political psychology, traced the phenomenon to Malala Yousafzai and her 2014 acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize. Yousafzai, who was 17 at the time, earned the prestigious award for her efforts to ensure all people, but especially women and children in her native northwest Pakistan, have the right to an education.\n\n\u201cHer getting that award at such a young age changed the political gravitas around younger people being able to be powerful forces for change, and spokespeople for issues of change,\u201d McDermott said.\n\nYouth advocates\u2019 rise to prominence was also fueled by advances in technology and social media, according to McDermott. Over the past decade, sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \u2014 coupled with the rise of smartphones \u2014 have displaced traditional media distribution platforms like newspapers and cable TV, she said.\n\nThat means young people can deliver immediate, unfiltered messages that earn them massive followings and influence unthinkable in a pre-iPhone era, according to McDermott. Hogg, Gonzalez and others wielded their Twitter accounts to gain international attention as they fought to end gun violence in the wake of a deadly shooting at their Parkland, Fla., high school in February 2018. Thunberg\u2019s path to fame began when she posted an Instagram picture of herself sitting outside Sweden\u2019s parliament building to protest government inaction on climate change in August 2018.\n\n[Teen girls are leading the climate strikes and helping change the face of environmentalism]\n\nBut \u2014 as youth advocates emerged into the spotlight \u2014 they also became targets for criticism. To some extent, that\u2019s fair, Prenelli said.\n\nFor example, \u201cbecause Greta is at the foreground of this movement, she is a legitimate target for criticism about what she\u2019s advocating,\u201d Prenelli said. \u201cBut when you start attacking her in this way that denies she\u2019s a normal human being \u2026 that just seems out of bounds.\u201d\n\nThe increasing nastiness of attacks launched against young activists reflects a broader shift in American political discourse, experts said. The tone of discussion \u2014 whether between adults or directed at children \u2014 has become vastly more juvenile and insulting in recent years, said Thomas Gustafson, a professor of English and American studies at the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed many forms of decorum broken in our politics, with President Trump taking a lead in bringing tabloid sensationalism and below-the-belt verbal punches,\u201d Gustafson said. \u201cThe ad hominem attacks on Hogg and Thunberg are another blow.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmma Gonzalez, a survivor of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., closes her eyes in March 2018 and cries as she stands silently at the podium for the amount of time it took the Parkland shooter to go on his killing spree during the \"March for Our Lives\" rally in support of gun control in Washington. (Andrew Harnik File)\n\nOthers also pointed to Trump as a catalyst, laying blame on both his language and his policies. The president is well known for name-calling and for issuing highly personal attacks on opponents.\n\nTrump views these kinds of comments as proof he is more genuine than other politicians \u2014 he wants to be seen as \u201ctelling it like it is,\u201d Prenelli said. Public figures across the political spectrum have followed suit, creating a world where \u201cyou can start saying vile things that people in the past would not put forward,\u201d Prenelli said.\n\nMcDermott, meanwhile, pointed to the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a society accepting the wide-scale separation of kids from parents, that allows the maltreatment of kids at the border, it\u2019s not that far a leap to start treating political opponents \u2014 even if they\u2019re kids \u2014 more badly,\u201d she said.\n\n[This linguist studied the way Trump speaks for two years. Here's what she found.]\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say whether this new age of nasty rhetoric will permanently reshape American politics, experts said.\n\nBesides, though we may be living through a new low, the country has a long history of political name-calling, Gustafson said.\n\nHe noted that Washington Irving, an essayist, historian and diplomat of the 19th century most famous for writing the short story \u201cRip Van Winkle,\u201d once dubbed the United States government a \u201clogocracy\u201d in which politicians and newspapers fought battles of words and engaged in \u201cslangwhanging.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Irving] would not be surprised at all by Twitter insults,\u201d Gustafson said. \u201cBut I suspect he would be appalled at ad hominem attacks on figures too young to vote.\u201d", "description": "America has entered a new era of political discourse, experts say: one that allows \u2014 even encourages \u2014 vitriolic verbal abuse of children and teenagers.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
