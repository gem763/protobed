The design, location and views are still what is really going to matter to any buyer, he added, but looking at what you can\u2019t see is important to understanding \u201cwhy it\u2019s worth what it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Miabelle Salzano"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-108046?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
