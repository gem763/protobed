The survivors were found ten days after the boat had sunk aboard a small aluminium dinghy in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMany of those who perished, died at sea from hunger, dehydration and hypothermia while adrift at sea for over a week.\n\n'One died while giving birth in (these) most unhealthy and extreme conditions,' the report read.\n\nThe deaths of 84 passengers and 11 crew was the worst maritime disaster ever in Kiribati, where ferries are a lifeline for the 110,000 living across its 33 atolls and reefs scattered over an area the size of the continental United States.\n\nA view of Kiritimati Island, in Kiribati. Ferries are a lifeline for the 110,000 living across the Pacific nation's 33 atolls and reefs scattered over an area the size of the continental United States\n\nFile photo shows President Taneti Maamau of Kiribati addresses at the United Nations headquarters. His office commissioned the report into the sinking - the worst maritime disaster his country has ever seen\n\nThe Kiribati government has previously provided few details about the circumstances of disaster, or even the number of fatalities, and initially refused to distribute the report widely.\n\nHowever it has since released the details of the report, commissioned by its presidential office, which found the vessel, a 57-foot catamaran, should never have set out on its ill-fated voyage.\n\nIt highlighted widespread use of alcohol by the master and crew during working hours, 'giving every drunken crew (member) the feeling of grandeur and power to make decisions alone', a lack of leadership and limited survival training.\n\nOne of the ferry's life-rafts was 'non-functioning', its distress beacon was missing or broken, it was not licensed to carry passengers and it had run aground twice before the voyage, damaging the vessel's structural integrity.\n\nThe report found the vessel, a 57 foot catamaran, should never have set out on its ill-fated voyage, as its structural integrity was compromised and it had no distress beacon\n\nFacing strong winds and 8.2-ft waves, the report found the catamaran began to fall apart 30 minutes into the journey and had split and sank after two hours.\n\nTwo life rafts carrying a total of 50 people were launched but one became unusable after a puncture. As passengers reached for the one working lifeboat, its floor 'failed' as well, the commission said.\n\nOthers clung to the capsized hull of the ferry.\n\n'With hardly any food and water, the survivors began to perish,' investigators said\n\nIn addition the ferry, which was laden with almost 30 tonnes of dried coconut kernels and empty fuel drums, set off in rough seas without the crew notifying maritime authorities of its departure.\n\nThis omission meant it was several days before authorities realised the catamaran was missing and a search effort was organised.\n\n'It was obvious the master of the MV Butiraoi was reckless and inconsiderate of the ship, crew and passengers,' it said. The ship's master did not survive the sinking.\n\nThe report has recommended stricter maritime policing to ensure reporting procedures were properly followed, a tighter inspection regime and better boat building standards.", "description": "The MV Butiraoi broke down in poor weather and began to sink mere minutes after setting off on its intended 155 mile-journey from Nonouti island to the nation's capital, Tarawa.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19445982-0-image-a-25_1570547050841.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
