It marked Washington\u2019s second loss divisional loss of the year, and both came as double-digit favorites.\n\nThis time around, Stanford, losers of three of its last four games, put up points on its first three drives en route to a 13-7 lead. And had it not been for goal line stops on two of those possessions (both led to 20-yard field goals), the deficit for Washington would have been much worse.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStanford\u2019s lead was 13-10 at halftime. Washington had a chance to tie it with a short field goal coming out of the break, but Chris Petersen kept his offense on the field on fourth-and-two from the Stanford 13. Instead, Jacob Eason\u2019s pass fell incomplete and Stanford maintained a lead it would never relinquish.\n\nA four-yard rushing touchdown by Cameron Scarlett made it 20-10 Cardinal with 6:02 left in the third. Washington would tack on a field goal later in the third, but that was as close as UW would get.\n\nFollowing an Eason interception, Stanford tacked on a field goal to make it 23-13 with 8:04 to play. Washington would touch the ball twice more, and those possessions culminated with a punt and the end of regulation.\n\nStanford running back Cameron Scarlett rushed for 151 yards in a win over Washington.

During the winning streak, Washington looked like one of the Pac-12\u2019s best. But the Huskies put forth a pretty miserable performance on Saturday night in a loss that put an end to any meager College Football Playoff dreams they may have still had.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis Stanford team has injuries across the board, especially on the offensive line. But the Cardinal \u2014 a week after barely beating Oregon State \u2014 were still able to control the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball.\n\nEven with backup quarterback Davis Mills getting the start, Stanford really controlled the ball offensively, putting up 482 total yards, while Washington\u2019s heralded rushing attack was limited to just 88 yards on 22 carries. And while the running game struggled, so did Eason. The Georgia transfer has shown flashes of what made him a five-star recruit who was able to start as a true freshman in the SEC. But those traits were not evident on Saturday. Eason completed only 16 of his 36 attempts for 206 yards, a touchdown and an interception.\n\nThough Washington\u2019s loss puts No. 13 Oregon (4-1, 2-0) in the driver\u2019s seat in the Pac-12 North, there\u2019s still a long way to go. But UW\u2019s next three games could be against ranked opponents. The Huskies head to Arizona next weekend and the Wildcats could move into the Top 25 after beating Colorado 35-30 in Boulder to improve to 4-1 on the year.\n\nFrom there, Washington will host Oregon on Oct. 19. After a bye week, No. 17 Utah, arguably the best team in the Pac-12 South, will visit Seattle. With two conference losses, Washington doesn\u2019t have much wiggle room if it wants to win the division for the third time in the last four seasons.\n\nWhat does this mean for Stanford?\n\nWell, a bowl game is still very possible. That did not seem like it was in the cards for David Shaw\u2019s program when it was getting blown out in three consecutive weeks earlier in the season.\n\nNow 3-3, Stanford is going to have to pull off another upset or two to get to a bowl, but it\u2019s certainly possible even with so many linemen out for the season. However, Stanford finished the game without Mills, leaving third-string QB Jack West to control the huddle. If starter K.J. Costello and Mills are out for any considerable period of time, the program\u2019s bowl streak \u2014 which dates back to 2009, Jim Harbaugh\u2019s third season \u2014 could be in jeopardy.\n\nThe rest of the season looks like this: vs. UCLA, vs. Arizona, at Colorado, at Washington State, vs. Cal and vs. Notre Dame. Do you see three wins in there?\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "No. 15 Washington\u2019s quest for another Pac-12 North title took a big hit on Saturday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/a4xuzY8DDzLYksmGXhRxog--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lLuVIh_BR8dq_SQly9JSqQ--~B/aD0zNDQ5O3c9NTE3MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6212e0d0-e7fc-11e9-b9fc-2fb92f071df4", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
