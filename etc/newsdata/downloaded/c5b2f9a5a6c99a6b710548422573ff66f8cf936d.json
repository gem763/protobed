Eventually, identities would likely be tied to respective individual wallets, hence making it fully non-anonymous, unlike bitcoin.\u201d\n\nFor it to work on any significant scale, the new currency\u2019s payment infrastructure will need to be able to process and handle a huge volume of transactions. The report suggests this would be somewhere in the region of 300,000 transactions per second, though currently no blockchains are capable of supporting such a high volume.\n\nThe cryptocurrency would also presumably require users to own smartphones, even if they don\u2019t have bank accounts. Current estimates suggest that only around half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion inhabitants own smartphones.\n\nLike Facebook\u2019s Libra, China\u2019s new cryptocurrency is designed to bring key financial services to those without bank accounts.\n\nThe PBOC first started researching the potential of a new cryptocurrency in 2014, however according to Binance\u2019s report, the development of the cryptocurrency was fast-tracked after Facebook first announced its plans for Libra earlier this year.\n\n\u201cDigital currencies are coming into the mainstream and international competition is heating up. Economies risk being disadvantaged if they are left behind,\u201d Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s new currency could even rival Facbook\u2019s notorious proposed cryptocurrency, Libra. This is largely because Facebook is not permitted in China, giving the government a potential monopoly over the market.\u201d", "description": "China\u2019s plans for a state-backed cryptocurrency could eliminate the need for bank accounts, new research has suggested.\u00a0 A report published by Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, gave an overview of what China\u2019s central bank digital currency is expected to look like and how it will compare to bitcoin and Facebook\u2019s forthcoming Libra currency.", "authors": ["Anthony Cuthbertson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/13/10/china-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-when.jpg"}
