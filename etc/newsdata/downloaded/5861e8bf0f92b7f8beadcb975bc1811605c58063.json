No Matter What tour, and he'd seemed happier than ever.\n\nBut through the shock and tears, they knew what they had to do - and that was bring him home.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nTaking the load off Stephen's distraught husband Andrew Cowles - who found him dead on their sofa of their holiday home after a night out - the boys flew straight to Majorca.\n\nBut as soon as the plane landed, the fog of shock lifted and their worlds began to fall apart.\n\n\"When I walked into the funeral home I just crumbled, we all did. I fell to pieces, it was there that I realised he was gone, really gone and that was very hard for all of us, for our families,\" Ronan told Sky News.\n\nThey were tasked with choosing a coffin, something Keith described as the, \"hardest thing that any of us have had to do in our lives.\"\n\n(Image: Hulton Archive)\n\n\"This was something that was going to be the last thing that your friend is going to lie in,\" he added.\n\nIt was the same coffin that the heartbroken foursome would spend the night before the funeral next to at St Laurence O'Toole Roman Catholic church in Dublin before because his mum worried Stephen \"didn't like to be alone.\"\n\nThey camped on the church floor in sleeping bags, sharing songs and stories with their best friend.\n\n\"We cried and we laughed and we could hear him telling us jokes and we could hear him answering back...\" Ronan later said. \"It was a beautiful, amazing experience to be there with Steo that night.\"\n\nAt the funeral they delivered a moving eulogy, their voices breaking as they remembered Stephen, 33, before carrying his coffin to the hearse.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut once the funeral was over, it was then that the true horror of the situation began to take its cruel toll.\n\nFor Keith, his grief took the form of chilling nightmares - so terrifying that he didn't dare go to sleep.\n\n\"I was distraught - I felt anger, disbelief, I cried a lot and had terrible nightmares,\" he told Closer magazine.\n\n\"In the first few weeks they were terrifying. I couldn't breathe, I'd go light-headed and it was incredibly frightening.\"\n\nFor years he struggled to understand the loss and tried to \"knock himself out\" with alcohol\n\nAnd when the band hit the road just two years later with their grief still raw, it ended in disaster.\n\n\u201cHe died in 2009 and we were back on the road in 2011, two years later - which was way too soon. Way too soon,\" Keith told The Express.\n\n\u201cEmotionally and psychologically\u2026 I\u2019ll be very honest, myself and Shane were drinking too much, trying to numb the pain, onstage and offstage.\n\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t work, and it wasn\u2019t enjoyable. We didn\u2019t want to be together. That\u2019s when we took a sabbatical.\"\n\nMikey agreed, admitting they \"weren't \"emotionally stable enough.\"\n\n(Image: Phil Griffin)\n\n\"We hadn't really gone through the grieving process enough. We hadn't received counselling or the stuff that we should have done for such a great loss,\" he said in 2014.\n\n\"And I think that tour kind of brought an awful lot of that out in each one of us. We missed him so much... it was too early.\"\n\nLike Keith, Ronan's mental health deteriorated and his life-long Catholic faith was tested to the core.\n\n\"You can't breathe, you feel like your chest is collapsing, the walls are coming in on top of you,\" he told the Guardian of how grief had affected him.\n\n\"My brain doesn't work. My heart's broken. You just feel crushed... It's been horrible. We've all been feeling the same way since Stephen passed. Mentally I'm absolutely exhausted.\"\n\nFilming their 2010 tribute video, Gave It All Away, was equally harrowing, especially as Stephen's vocals were on the song.\n\n\"The video day was horrible - absolutely horrible - and even in the finished version you'll see us all crying,\" Shane said.\n\n\"The concept was that we were writing our last letters to Steo. At times I was laughing because it brought back great memories but sometimes I couldn't take it. I'd just break down and I had to get out.\"\n\nOver the last decade their wounds slowly began to heal. But last year Boyzone announced their retirement, with Ronan admitted it had never been the same without Stephen.\n\n\"Losing Stephen in 2009, for me, it's never felt right since then,\" he said, revealing, \"the rest of the boys feel the same.\"\n\nHe continued: \"That was probably the point where we should've called it a day. We've been on and off since then.\"\n\nThey've kept his memory alive though, celebrating his birthday each year and talking to him before each show.\n\n(Image: Splash)\n\nAnd Shane said they know he is always with them.\n\n\"Every time we got together it was very apparent that he was alive,\" he said on Celebrity Big Brother .\n\n\u201cBecause that was our bubble. He\u2019s still there. So we\u2019ll always be five, regardless of visually what you see. He will always be there.\u201d", "description": "The death of Boyzone's Stephen Gately took a lasting toll on his heartbroken bandmates Ronan Keating, Shane Lynch, Mikey Graham and Keith Duffy", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Getty Images", "Daily Mirror", "Hulton Archive", "Pa", "Phil Griffin", "Splash"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article2862850.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Boyzone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
