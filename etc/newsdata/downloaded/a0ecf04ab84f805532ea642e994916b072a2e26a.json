By which time he was nearly five years clear of the joint.\n\nMore recently, as industrials analyst at Patersons, Jacobs has been wantonly spruiking controversial ID verification fintech iSignthis, which the Australian Securities Exchange (in consultation with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission) on October 2 suspended from trading, where it remains.\n\nOver four berserk weeks, Jacobs racheted up his price target on iSignthis by a dizzying 381 per cent. On July 30, he increased it 65 per cent, from 43\u00a2 to 71\u00a2, off the back of the company\u2019s quarterly investor briefing. Not even a week later, on August 5, he upgraded again \u2013 another 63 per cent to $1.16. And on August 29, off the back of iSignthis\u2019 1H result, he raised his valuation another 78 per cent to $2.07. On his last vacation in Rome, Jacobs scaled the Spanish Steps in three strides.\n\nLeast timely of all was Jacobs\u2019 October 2 broadcast entitled \u201cmomentum continues to build\u201d, reaffirming his $2.07 price and buy recommendation on iSignthis. It was hitting his clients\u2019 inboxes more than 30 minutes after the ASX had suspended it from official quotation! A milestone worth factoring into its investability, one would\u2019ve thought\u2026\n\niSignthis last traded at $1.07 and has to be long odds to trade again.\n\nAnd by dubious coincidence, Jacobs was personally invested in the precipitous escalator the company\u2019s stock was briefly on. \u201cThe analyst owns shares in ISX\u201d, was Patersons\u2019 disclosure on each of his published notes.
