Oh, let\u2019s. Everyone knows Donald Trump is a mental case, including I believe Donald Trump. Why else does he keep insisting he is an \u201cextremely stable genius\u201d? It\u2019s as if he knows a lot of people are certain he\u2019s neither.\n\nIt would be nice here to say, \u201cI don\u2019t mean mental case. I mean his mind is a raucous TV funhouse; that he is immature, unserious, and at the mercy of poor impulse control; that he doesn\u2019t exercise power intelligently but emotionally, and with an eye, always to personal needs.\u201d But mental case will do.\n\nHe just fired his third national security adviser, by Twitter , under contested circumstances. They had apparently argued: the president was going to invite the Taliban, that band of gangsters, mooks and morons who housed the terrorists who killed 3,000 of us 18 years ago this week, to Camp David. Camp David! The august retreat where presidents host great nations and great allies. Where FDR met with Churchill and Reagan walked with Thatcher.\n\nNo one who knows what history IS would do this. No one who knows the American people would do it. No one who felt 9/11 in his bones would do it. But a guy going for a cheap handshake and a triumphant photo would. It\u2019s the kind of idea a mental case might readily entertain.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peggy Noonan", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": ""}
