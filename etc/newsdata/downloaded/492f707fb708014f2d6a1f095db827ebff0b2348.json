But at New York Comic Con, Square Enix gave a fresh look at Avengers that proves there\u2019s more to it than just a very expensive tie-in to the popular Marvel films.\n\nFirst, the news. At its NYCC panel today, the company announced a sixth playable hero that will be available at launch: Ms. Marvel \u2014 aka Kamala Khan \u2014 who\u2019ll actually be the protagonist of Avengers, working to get the team back together to face a new threat. Marvel Games also announced a release date for the PSVR exclusive Iron Man VR, which will be out on February 28th next year. More importantly, though, Square Enix showed off more of the actual \u201cgame\u201d part of Avengers. I got to play two separate demos that were radically different in how they presented the game.\n\nMore than just a very expensive tie-in\n\nThe first was a slightly extended version of Avengers\u2019 tutorial sequence, which Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics have shown off multiple times before at both E3 and Gamescom. It\u2019s flashy and cinematic, portraying the disastrous events of \u201cA-Day\u201d that will tee up the rest of the game. The sequence lets players control five of the six main characters at launch, giving a taste of the bare basics of how each hero plays. But as a showcase of the game, it\u2019s terrible: entirely on rails, with quick time events taking the place of more involved gameplay.\n\nMore problematic is the fact that, at least in the tutorial, each hero feels kind of similar. The animations and moves are all different, but when limited to predesigned set pieces, each plays almost identically. There\u2019s definitely a thrill in jetting around as Iron Man, but Hulk\u2019s smashing doesn\u2019t feel markedly different from Cap\u2019s shield bashing.\n\nThankfully, this wasn\u2019t the case in the second demo. It was a combat training module that centered on the game\u2019s newly revealed sixth hero Ms. Marvel; it took off the training wheels and gave me free control over the stretching hero to bash my way through an army of androids. The change is remarkable: with more abilities unlocked and player freedom, combat as Kamala actually feels like what you\u2019d expect from reading the comics, and it\u2019s really fun to play.\n\nThe best analogy here for combat is still the most recent God of War game: there\u2019s a light attack / heavy attack / ranged attack setup, along with special \u201cheroic\u201d moves that players can choose that are on timed cooldowns. (For Ms. Marvel, this was a burst of healing, an enemy-flattening palm strike, and her signature \u201cembiggen\u201d move, which supersizes Ms. Marvel and lets her deal more damage.) Ms. Marvel also has a separate meter for temporarily \u201cembiggening\u201d that lets her enhance specific attacks by holding down a trigger button when attacking, which ties perfectly into the character.\n\nThe end result felt a lot like Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man for the PS4, in the sense of how well it captured what it\u2019d be like to play as that specific hero. The real question is whether Square Enix can replicate that feat across the other heroes outside of the tutorial.\n\nSquare Enix also finally previewed character customization at NYCC, which is another major component of the game. There are essentially three parts to building your heroes: cosmetic looks, items, and skills.\n\nCosmetics are the easiest to understand: they\u2019re skins for how each character looks in-game. They don\u2019t affect gameplay at all, and Square Enix says that it\u2019s working on a wide variety of styles, both original and inspired by Marvel\u2019s decades of comic books. (It also means that you won\u2019t be stuck with the default, off-brand MCU designs for the whole game.) A few previewed skins included a King Thor outfit, a Joe Fixit Hulk, Captain America\u2019s classic costume, and Iron Man\u2019s \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d suit. Some skins can be unlocked in-game for free, while others will be sold for real money.\n\nNext are equipped items, which should look pretty familiar if you\u2019ve ever played a game like Destiny. Each item has a \u201cGear Level\u201d and a color-coded rarity, as well as specific perks that augment or enhance that hero\u2019s abilities. Perks have to be unlocked using a variety of in-game resources (which look similar to Destiny\u2019s planetary materials), and there are gear sets with specific perks that will synergize together. The game is also surprisingly RPG-like: enemies, players, and missions all have numeric levels, and Avengers isn\u2019t shy about throwing up big damage numbers for your attacks. And while I didn\u2019t get a chance to try out the gear system in person, it looks like collecting gears and optimizing your equipment will be a big part of Avengers.\n\nLastly, there are unlockable skills. Each hero has a variety of skill trees for different aspects of their abilities that players can unlock and equip using skill points. (For example, Iron Man has separate melee, repulser, laser, and rocket skill trees.) Players will also be able to choose between a variety of \u201cheroic\u201d special abilities here.\n\nCombining all that \u2014 in theory \u2014 lets you build vastly different versions of the same hero. In an example we were given, one developer preferred to build Thor as a crowd control character, focusing on an area of effect attacks and gear that would give faster cooldowns. Another chose to take a more melee-facing route with an emphasis on close-up damage and defense.\n\nThe developer also gave more details on the structure of the game. There are two types of missions in Avengers. Single-player-only \u201cHero Missions\u201d are traditional story missions designed for (and limited to) a specific hero. Iron Man levels, the company promises, will be wide open spaces with room to fly, while Hulk levels will emphasize destructible terrain to smash.\n\nSquare Enix is promising a lot here, and there are still a lot of unanswered questions\n\nThere are also Warzone levels, where players can choose any hero in their roster and play either solo or online with friends, which offers more of a focus on gaining resources and gear; or, to borrow a Destiny analogy again, if the Hero Missions are Destiny\u2019s story-focused campaign levels, Warzone maps are the more replayable Strikes. Missions are selected from a map that also feels remarkably Destiny-esque, down to the recommended levels and likely gear rewards that pop up.\n\nSquare Enix is promising a lot here, and there are still a lot of unanswered questions. We don\u2019t know what co-op gameplay will look like or how it will work with different heroes running around. The company has promised that future heroes and areas will be free, and that it doesn\u2019t want to have any \u201cpay for power\u201d scenarios, but there\u2019s still no word as to what paid DLC will look like outside of purchasable skins. There\u2019s no public gameplay of what the story missions will look like, or how those will work.\n\nAnd while Square Enix is promising that it\u2019ll be stewarding Avengers for years after launch, we don\u2019t know how much content will actually be available when it comes out this May, or if any endgame (pun-intended) content will be available \u2014 something that games like Destiny, The Division, and Anthem have all shown to be a crucial part of live service games like this.\n\nFortunately, there are still months until the promised May 15th, 2020 release date, and Square Enix is presumably working on (or already has) the answers to many of these questions. For now, though, it\u2019s clear that Avengers has ambitions to be as big as the billion-dollar blockbusters whose name it shares. We\u2019ll find out soon enough if it actually can.", "description": "At New York Comic Con, Square Enix gave a fresh look at Avengers that proves there\u2019s more to it than just a very expensive tie-in to the popular Marvel films.
