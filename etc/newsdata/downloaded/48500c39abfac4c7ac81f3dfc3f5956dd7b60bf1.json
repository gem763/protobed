The news reflects the general trend with Apple over the past year: iPhone sales are down, but service revenue hit an all-time high. In other words, Apple\u2019s strategy to de-emphasize hardware sales and bet more on subscription services seems to be working.\n\nThat $64 billion in revenue is up 2 percent year over year compared to Q4 2018, with quarterly earnings per diluted share of $3.03, up 4 percent from Q4 2018.\n\niPhone sales \u2014 still Apple\u2019s biggest moneymaker \u2014 continued to decline compared to last year\n\nBut iPhone sales \u2014 still Apple\u2019s biggest moneymaker \u2014 continued to decline compared to last year, bringing in $33.36 billion in revenue compared to $36.76 billion last year, a drop of roughly 9.2 percent. On the flip side, Apple reported that it had reached a record high for its services business, which brought in $12.5 billion in Q4 (compared to $11.46 billion last quarter, and $10.6 billion year over year). Apple says it now has \u201cover 450 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, compared to over 330 million just a year ago.\u201d\n\nMac revenue was also down nearly 5 percent to $6.99 billion, although iPads ($4.65 billion in revenue) and Apple\u2019s wearables / home / accessories unit ($6.52 billion in revenue) both saw sizable jumps compared to last year.\n\nNotably, Apple\u2019s new service record comes before the launch of Apple TV Plus, perhaps its biggest bet yet on selling consumer subscriptions (although the number does include Apple\u2019s new Arcade games service, which launched back in September).\n\n\u201cWe concluded a groundbreaking fiscal 2019 with our highest Q4 revenue ever, fueled by accelerating growth from Services, Wearables and iPad,\u201d commented Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, in a press release. \u201cWith customers and reviewers raving about the new generation of iPhones, today\u2019s debut of new, noise-cancelling AirPods Pro, the hotly-anticipated arrival of Apple TV+ just two days away, and our best lineup of products and services ever, we\u2019re very optimistic about what the holiday quarter has in store.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s next quarter will be an interesting one, given that its Q1 quarter tends to include the bulk of its holiday sales, as well as the fact that it\u2019ll be the first to include the upcoming TV Plus service. The company is forecasting revenue for Q1 2020 between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion, compared to the $84.3 billion it made in Q1 2019.\n\nDeveloping...", "description": "Apple reported its fiscal Q4 2019 earnings, where the company announced that it had earned a record $64 billion in revenue (up 2 percent year over year) \u2014 its best ever. iPhone sales continued to slow compared to last year, although the company\u2019s up and coming services business set a new revenue record for the company.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9UQpwU7k-G2aeq6L8OPdaS9jKc=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11477053/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
