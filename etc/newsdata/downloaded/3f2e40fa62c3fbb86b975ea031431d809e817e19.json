But in Japan and Scandinavia, there\u2019s that appreciation of things that are made by hand, made with care and made to last, they\u2019re treated with respect and affection.\u201d\n\nTolstrup\u2019s firm Studio Mama designed a 1m-long shoe horn called Routine, for Japanese brand E&Y. \u201cIt\u2019s sculptural in shape, stands on the floor, and is hand-crafted, working with the grains of the wood,\u201d she explains. E&Y has also collaborated with the Swedes Claesson Koivisto Rune and Johannes Norlander, and the Finns Mika Tolvanen and Ilkka Suppanen.\n\nJapanese designer Tomoko Azumi, whose TNA Design Studio is based in London, admits that she has never heard the word \u2018Japandi\u2019, \u201cbut I became aware of the trend when my Japanese client Time & Style got an overwhelming reception for their debut appearance at this year\u2019s Stockholm Furniture Fair.\u201d At next year\u2019s fair, the company \u2013 which has a shop in Tokyo and another in Amsterdam \u2013 will launch Azumi\u2019s Gyokuro Tea Box, a porcelain tea set for a special type of green tea.
