(Oct. 4) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Expanding his scorched-earth defense against possible impeachment, President Donald Trump now accuses House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of \"treason\" and says she is the one who should be impeached.\n\nHaving made similar claims against Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Trump said Pelosi has abetted unfair tactics in the investigation of his dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\"This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason,\" Trump tweeted late Sunday. \"I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly 'Colluded' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\"\n\nMembers of Congress cannot be impeached. Impeachment is a tool that Congress uses to investigate judges or executive branch officials they believe may have committed crimes.\n\nNancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan \u201cWhistleblower\u201d & lawyer... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nPelosi, Schiff, and other Democrats have made clear they will continue to investigate Trump's efforts to have Ukraine and perhaps other countries investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic U.S. presidential candidate.\n\n\"It\u2019s about a damning call in which the President pressured a foreign power to investigate a political rival, harming national security,\" Schiff tweeted over the weekend. \"It\u2019s about our democracy.\"\n\nSome critics have accused Trump of \"treason\" \u2013 a crime punishable by death \u2013 for seeking to involve another country in the American presidential election.\n\nTrump's attack on Pelosi came during a weekend of angry tweets against Democrats, journalists, whistleblowers, and others involved in the impeachment drama.\n\nAt one point, Trump took after Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, for criticizing the president over calls to have China, as well as Ukraine, investigate Biden.\n\nTrump also called to have Romney impeached, though, again, members of Congress are not subject to the impeachment process.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/07/treason-trump-lashes-out-pelosi-and-wants-impeach-her/3896006002/", "description": "Donald Trump's scorched-earth defense tactics during impeachment include accusing investigators of 'treason.'", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Published A.M.
