Treasuries edged higher.\n\nContracts on the three major U.S. gauges pointed to positive open on Wall Street, while shares climbed in most of Asia after President Donald Trump said he will delay the next tariff increase on China by about two weeks and following reports Beijing is considering American farm imports. Hong Kong equities dipped, weighed down by shares of the city\u2019s exchange following a surprise takeover bid for its London counterpart. The yuan strengthened.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index erased an earlier gain, the euro strengthened and regional bonds were mixed ahead of the ECB gathering, where most expectations are for policy makers to lower the deposit rate and commence a new round of monetary stimulus. The pound drifted as Brexit confusion dragged on, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson winning a key legal victory in Northern Ireland a day after a Scottish court ruled against his decision to shutter Parliament.\n\nThe steps by China and the U.S. to ease tensions ahead of face-to-face talks in Washington in the coming weeks are helping support sentiment as investors await monetary policy decisions from the world\u2019s major central banks. Trump said he was moving back a 5% increase in tariffs on a swathe of Chinese imports by two weeks, while Beijing may allow companies to resume purchases of U.S. agricultural products, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\n\u201cThe quantum and nature of the changes mean they are more symbolic than substantial, but were still well received by investors,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Plc in Sydney.\n\nIn addition to Thursday\u2019s ECB gathering, the Federal Reserve is meeting next week, with some traders paring expectations of accommodation and August\u2019s bullish bond sentiment fading.
