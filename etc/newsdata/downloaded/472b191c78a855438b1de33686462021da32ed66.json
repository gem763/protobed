The Finn disobliged him by finishing third, a place behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.\n\nNow Hamilton needs only to finish eighth in America, where he has won in five of the last seven years, to be certain of moving ahead of fellow quintuple champion Juan Manuel Fangio and behind only Michael Schumacher, with seven titles, in the all-time achievers' list.\n\nHamilton stood on his car in the stadium area, the Foro Sol, to soak up the applause at the end. It was not the full celebration he wanted but a joy nonetheless. 'Great job,' he said over the radio. 'Thanks for all your help.\n\n'That was a tough race.'\n\nHamilton tosses his sombrero into the crowd as he celebrates his win in Mexico on Sunday afternoon\n\nThe top five drivers on Sunday swapped places again and again, making amateur Archimedes of us all.\n\nWas Charles Leclerc, who started on pole for Ferrari, in too early \u2013 after 15 laps of the 71? Could he make his tyres last?\n\nNo, as it turned out. It was another horrible mess by the Scuderia. They should have won this, yet Leclerc finished fourth. Their failure to perform has made this season a numbingly predictable bore. Shame on them.\n\nSimilarly, was Hamilton reshod earlier than was prudent, on lap 24? No, as we saw when he finished 1.7sec in front.\n\nThe Brit was not always so sure the team's plan was ultra cunning, as he made clear in curt exchanges with his pit wall. 'It feels like we stopped way too early,' he bemoaned.\n\nHe has to be comforted by the chief strategist James Vowles. He is not a voice regularly heard on radio, his interventions marking some moment of import.\n\nThe five-time world champion came from third to finish first ahead of Sebastian Vettel and team-mate Valtteri Bottas\n\n'Lewis, this is James,' came the reassurance. 'You can do this.'\n\nVowles's involvement was especially needed because Hamilton's usual race engineer Peter Bonnington \u2013 to whom the race winner dedicated his triumph \u2013 was back in Britain for a medical procedure.\n\nOne pitied his stand-in, Marcus Dudley, as Hamilton's exasperation rose.\n\nThe champion finally took the lead on lap 44, his doubts subsiding, after Bottas and Vettel had peeled in for their delayed stops and Leclerc for his second.\n\nBut at this point Bottas was not where the championship maths said he needed to be \u2013 14 points or more adrift of Hamilton.\n\nIt was a weekend of fluctuations. When Hamilton qualified fourth, his title chances looked slim. But, on the other hand, there was the possibility that Bottas might start at the bottom of the field: he crashed in qualifying and would possible require changes of parts that carried with them grid penalties.\n\nThe Mercedes driver salutes the crowd after coming first and putting himself within touching distance of another world title\n\nThe Briton celebrates by performing donuts in front of the Mexico City crowd following the finish of the race\n\nNo, 24 legal components of his car were replaced from nose pins to seat belts in a seven-hour rebuilding job that was only completed half an hour before the pit lane opened on Sunday. Bottas started where he qualified \u2013 sixth.\n\nThere was also the Max Verstappen factor. The Red Bull man grabbed pole but had it ripped off him because he did not stop for the yellow flags waved because of Bottas's accident.\n\nVerstappen was demoted three places, moving Hamilton up one. Now there was an extra glimmer for our man, Lewis.\n\nHow, we wondered, would Hamilton behave off the start? He did not need to take chances. Why involve himself in an elbow fight with the brilliant but rash Max?\n\nAs it happened they did entwine in the opening corners. Hamilton escaped unharmed. Verstappen then tangled with Bottas, landed a puncture and tumbled down the field before fighting his way back to finish sixth.\n\nCharles Leclerc lost four seconds in a botched pitstop late on in the race, completing a frustrating race for the Ferrari driver\n\nThe excitement continued to the end with Hamilton told he had full power available to blast for the fastest lap. He tried everything, turning the screens green and purple \u2013 depicting personal and overall fastest times respectively \u2013 in certain sectors but could not pull it off over the full circuit. His rubber was too old for that.\n\nWhat else? Hamilton's fellow Brit Lando Norris has suffered at the hands of his McLaren team intermittently all season and so it happened again. A problem fitting his tyres meant he had to stop in the pit lane. He was wheeled back but retired from the race.\n\nThe last word goes to Hamilton. 'I have always wanted to win here,' he said of his first Mexican triumph. 'I don't mind waiting. I love racing.'", "description": "JONATHAN McEVOY IN MEXICO CITY: Lewis Hamilton came as close to winning his sixth world championship title as anyone's nerves could stand without actually doing so.", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcevoy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20257002-0-image-a-106_1572213034595.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
