Since 2017, the two men received a series of text messages containing links that pointed to infrastructure previously attributed to NSO Group by Amnesty as well as the digital rights organization Citizen Lab. The researchers said that the links, if clicked, were designed to silently install NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware on the targets\u2019 phones.\n\nPegasus is a surveillance software made by NSO Group. In the last few years, security researchers have found evidence that countries such as Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have used Pegasus to spy on journalists, human rights activists, and dissidents.\n\nSome of the malicious text messages received by Maati Monjib.

But I\u2019m under pressure in every minute of my life. I won\u2019t surrender,\u201d he said in an online chat. \u201cThey are powerful, I want to show them I\u2019m determined.\u201d\n\nHave a tip about a hack or a security incident?

They are not tools to surveil dissidents or human rights activists.\u201d\n\nNSO Group is one of a handful of companies that sell spyware and hacking tools to governments all over the world. The company says it only sells to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Morocco\u2019s mission to the United Nations, its Consulate in New York, and its Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request for comment via email.\n\nAmnesty researchers also found evidence of a more unusual and stealthy type of hack, known as \u201cman-in-the-middle,\u201d or network injection attack. In this type of attack, hackers who have control over internet infrastructure manipulate and intercept web traffic to redirect visits to legitimate websites to malicious ones, infecting the targets with malware.\n\nA chart explaining how a Man-In-The-Middle, or network injection attack, works. (Image: Amnesty International)\n\nEarlier this year, Monjib attempted to visit the French version of Yahoo\u2019s website typing Yahoo.fr on his iPhone\u2019s Safari browser. Instead of being directed to the official site, the browser sent him to a different site that was likely set up to install malware on his phone, according to Amnesty researchers, who believe that at least in one occasion Monjib\u2019s phone was successfully hacked. Amnesty researchers were able to spot evidence of this by inspecting Monjib\u2019s browsing history.\n\nAmnesty is not certain that these man-in-the-middle attacks were also performed with NSO Group\u2019s technology, but some circumstantial evidence points in that direction. First, the network injection attacks came following the malicious SMS attacks. Second, NSO allegedly offers this kind of capability to customers, according to a product brochure that was leaked as part of the Hacking Team breach.\n\n\u201cIt is important to document what types of offensive capabilities are being used against civil society, in order to properly strategize with at-risk individuals what can be done to protect themselves,\u201d Claudio Guarnieri, one of the Amnesty security researchers who investigated these attacks, told Motherboard. \u201cThis type of attack is hard to identify and prevent, and human rights defenders from Morocco and their support networks should be informed of what they might be up against.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our new cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.", "description": "Amnesty International details attacks against two Moroccan human rights activists allegedly carried out with NSO Group\u2019s spyware.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9e039599d7c90009cb078b/lede/1570645177054-Maati-Monjib.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.838xh;0xw,0.1188xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
