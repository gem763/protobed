That\u2019s when a man called Bill Mitchell came into my life. He was an old-style coach, an East Ender cast in the same mould as Len Goodman.\n\nOne day, Bill watched me dance in a contest and we got chatting afterwards. I told him I thought my partner and I had been rubbish, and he told me he thought I\u2019d been too hesitant.\n\nAnton du Beke, pictured here at the 23rd National Television Awards in London this year, said that the one lesson you have to learn in life is to blame no one except yourself\n\nThat threw me a bit, but it made me think. I decided to go to him once a week for a class \u2014 and I continued doing so for the next 25 years. He died five years before Strictly began. Each weekend, I\u2019d enter a dance competition with a partner, and every week he\u2019d ask me how I\u2019d got on.\n\nEach time, I had an excuse for not winning. I\u2019d blame the floor for being rough and uneven. Or say my suit was too tight. He\u2019d just nod sagely. But then came the day when I said I\u2019d have done better if my partner had got her steps right. Which is when he snapped.\n\nHe pointed his index finger right in my face. \u2018You,\u2019 he said, \u2018need to move her better.\u2019 And, with that, he took hold of the girl, danced her round the room and delivered her back to me. \u2018Nothing wrong with her,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s you. You\u2019ve just got to get better.\u2019\n\nThat really floored me. But quite quickly I realised he was right. Instead of blaming everyone and everything else \u2014 the floor, the girl, the suit \u2014 the solution lay within me.\n\n\u2018You control you,\u2019 he said. And then he repeated: \u2018Get better.\u2019 It was very simple, very direct. But he was spot on.\n\nThe floor was the same for everyone. So was the band; so were the judges. \u2018If you don\u2019t like your routine,\u2019 said Bill, \u2018change it.\u2019\n\nIn today\u2019s parlance, it would be: Own it. You\u2019re in charge of your own life.\n\nThat\u2019s something my hero, Bruce Forsyth, exemplified. Get better. Simple as that. I\u2019m still working on it.", "description": "Strictly star Anton Du Beke said that the one lesson you need to learn in life is not to blame anyone except yourself.
