(Jason Franson/The Canadian Press)\n\n\"AER engaged in activities outside of its mandate and public money was spent inappropriately on ICORE activities,\" read the report from Alberta Auditor General Doug Wylie.\n\nHe estimated the total financial impact of ICORE activities on the AER totalled $5.4 million, though $3.1 million was recouped. The AER is still out of pocket $2.3 million, according to the audit.\n\nWylie also concluded that ICORE activities lacked a credible benefit to the AER.\n\n'Gross mismanagement' by former CEO\n\nThe Office of the Public Interest Commissioner report levelled some of its strongest criticism at Jim Ellis, who was president and CEO of the AER and president of ICORE.\n\n\"His actions demonstrated a reckless and wilful disregard for the proper management of public funds, public assets and the delivery of a public service, which \u2026 constitutes gross mismanagement,\" the report said.\n\nEthics Commissioner Marguerite Trussler's report also found that Ellis had a conflict of interest \"in that he furthered his own interest and improperly furthered the private interest of three other employees.\"\n\n\"The primary motivation behind ICORE not-for-profit was to provide future employment for Mr. Ellis and others.\"\n\nHowever, Public Interest Commissioner Marianne Ryan told reporters during a news conference that there was no evidence to suggest Ellis benefited personally from a financial perspective.\n\nThe matters did not reach the threshold to refer them to the solicitor general for potential criminal charges, she said.\n\nRyan added that her report is not a condemnation of the AER as a whole. \"It was employees of the AER that brought this matter to my attention and assisted with the investigation,\" she said.\n\nControls to monitor expenses at first 'non-existent'\n\nThe auditor general's report also found that controls and processes to protect against potential conflicts of interest failed and that oversight from the AER's board was ineffective.\n\nAlberta Auditor General Doug Wylie's report also found that controls and processes to protect against potential conflicts of interest failed and that oversight from the AER's board was ineffective. (CBC)\n\n\"Controls to track and monitor expenses related to ICORE activities were at first non-existent and then poorly implemented,\" the report states. \"The tone at the top at AER did not support a strong control environment or compliance with policies.\"\n\nWylie's report said a \"culture of fear\" at the AER stifled concerns regarding ICORE activities, with a number of staff interviewed by his office saying that employees who expressed complaints felt at risk of losing their jobs.\n\nThe culture at the AER stifled concerns regarding ICORE activities, Wylie said. A number of staff interviewed by his office used the phrase a \"culture of fear\" and said employees who were vocal about expressing complaints were at risk of losing their jobs.\n\nAER sued ICORE in 2019\n\nA recent CBC News investigation found a close and complicated relationship between the AER and ICORE, including the involvement of Ellis.\n\nSeveral key figures who were involved with ICORE, including Ellis, are no longer associated with either organization. Ellis resigned from his post at the beginning of 2019. Ellis could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.\n\nAlso earlier this year, the AER sued ICORE and received a default judgment in its favour for $2.6 million for money it said it was owed for the development and delivery of training materials.\n\nThe results of the provincial investigations come at a time when the energy regulator is under scrutiny from the provincial government.\n\nIn September, Energy Minister Sonya Savage announced her department was launching a review of the AER and appointed an interim board of directors to set its future direction.\n\nSavage and Environment Minister Jason Nixon issued a joint statement Friday on the results of the investigations, saying they \"cannot condemn the practices noted in these reports strongly enough.\"\n\n\"Our government was elected on a promise to reform the AER, which is precisely why we have already taken action, launching a review of the AER in August and replaced the board in the same month,\" the statement said.\n\nThe recommendations contained within these reports will inform the Alberta government's review of the AER, they said, noting that they expect the agency's interim board to implement the reports' recommendations.\n\nAmong the recommendations outlined in the three reports:\n\nCorporate governance throughout Alberta agencies, boards and commissions needs to be strengthened.\n\nAER staff need to be made aware of and sufficiently trained on the whistleblowing process.\n\nThe AER should evaluate whether any additional funds expended on ICORE activities are recoverable.\n\nIn statement, the interim board of the AER said it will take the recommendations seriously and implement any required actions \"in order to enhance public confidence\" in the regulator.\n\n\"While ICORE was originally established to provide training to AER employees and support information-sharing across jurisdictions, it is clear now that a small group of senior leaders used AER resources in a way that is unacceptable,\" the regulator said in a statement. \"These individuals are no longer employed at the AER.\"", "description": "Alberta's energy regulator wrongfully used its\u00a0resources to establish an international centre outside its mandate, while its former CEO displayed \"reckless and wilful disregard\" for the management of public funds, according to investigations by three different provincial government watchdogs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309349.1570212128!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jim-ellis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
