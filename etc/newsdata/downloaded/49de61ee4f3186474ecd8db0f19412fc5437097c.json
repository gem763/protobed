Even though media and technology seem to be the cause of our collective pessimism, they\u2019re also essential for overcoming it, by either using them wisely or knowing when to put them away. Here are six ways to help kids find the silver lining in every cloud.\n\nPut things in perspective. When tragedy strikes somewhere in the world, we relive it every time we turn on the TV, open our social media, check our phone notifications or walk by a supermarket newsstand trumpeting a sensationalistic headline. Parents understand that the media amplifies things for eyeballs and clicks. But kids don\u2019t necessarily get the relationships among sources, sponsors and audience. How you respond to news makes a difference in how kids process it. Help your kids put things in perspective by explaining that the loudest voices capture the most listeners. When you \u201cright-size\u201d things, it lessens kids\u2019 fears and restores hope.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTalk about what you\u2019re grateful for. Counter defeatist attitudes by nurturing your kid\u2019s character. Strong character grounds kids when the world feels chaotic. Take the time to share what you\u2019re grateful for. Encourage children to persevere against obstacles and to have compassion for others. Research shows that expressing gratitude actually makes people happier. Try these character-building movies to kick off the conversation.\n\nFight fake news. A lot of kids say they can\u2019t tell the difference between what\u2019s real and fake online. Confusion, doubt, lack of trust \u2014 these things get in the way of being optimistic. But kids have the tools to fight fake news. They can use online fact-checking tools to discover the truth (or at least uncover the fraud). They can refuse to contribute to the spread of false information by not sharing stuff they can\u2019t verify. And they can call out dubious claims when they see them. Taking fact-checking into your own hands is empowering.\n\nStand up to cyberbullies. Teach your child that the buck stops with them. When they see someone getting bullied \u2014 and it happens all the time in texts, on social media and in online games \u2014 they shouldn\u2019t just stand by. While they should never do anything that would endanger themselves, they can do a lot to assert their support of others. They can call out cyberbullies, report them, stand up for the victim, or just privately message the victim and tell them someone cares. It\u2019s not tattling. It\u2019s truly everyone\u2019s responsibility to keep the Internet a positive, productive place. Standing up to cyberbullies shows you believe you can make a change.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStamp out hate speech. Online anonymity can have some unintended consequences. For example, people think they can spew hateful language or share insulting images without fear of being discovered. That may be true, but hate speech is not a victimless offense. While institutions are beginning to punish those who spread abusive material, no one should wait until that happens. Hate speech hurts people, contributes to an overall negative environment and is sometimes a cry for help from someone in crisis. Explain how to handle hate speech: Don\u2019t respond to it, block people who do it, report offenders and don\u2019t share it. If your child can influence only one person to knock off the negative stuff, then that person will influence someone else, and they\u2019ll influence someone else, and so on.\n\nTune out the world for a while. Grab your kids, grab your spouse if you have one, and shut everything else down. If they\u2019re all there with you, you won\u2019t miss anything. Simply being together, whether it\u2019s to read, have a device-free dinner or talk about an issue, recharges you and sends your kids the message that family time takes precedence over everything else. Experts recommend this kind of self-care because the buildup of bad news can be overwhelming and even debilitating. And if that\u2019s how adults feel, imagine how kids are reacting to the constant barrage. By managing your media and reclaiming your family time, you show your kids what\u2019s really important.\n\nCaroline Knorr is Common Sense Media\u2019s parenting editor.
