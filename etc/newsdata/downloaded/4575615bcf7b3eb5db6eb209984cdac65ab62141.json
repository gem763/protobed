From one-person operations running out of a locker and a laptop on the ground floor, to fully-fledged offices on the upper levels, Seoul\u2019s startup hub has supported 1,282 operations in various stages of growth in the past two years.\n\nIt has all the bells and whistles you come to associate with startup hubs across the world \u2013 shared dining and working spaces, a rest area with beanbags and egg-shaped couches, a fully decked-out kitchen for food-tech companies, a broadcast studio, a library, a slide between two floors and even a 7-Eleven for those powering through the night.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Seo-yeon Oh, the founder of Amuse Travel.

There are 85 accelerators in Seoul, and the amount of angel investment increased from about US$170m ($250m) in 2015 to US$250m in 2017.\n\nSince 2015, the South Korean government has provided $4bn to startups, Forbes has reported, the biggest government backing of startups per capita in the world. In April, Seoul\u2019s mayor, Park Won-soon, said the aim was to make Seoul a global top five startup city by 2022.\n\nKorea is particularly attractive for startups because of its high-speed internet, the fast rollout of the 5G network and the high uptake of technology.\n\nThe push towards startups has been driven by slow growth from the traditional larger companies, according to Seoul Startup Hub co-founder Matt Kang.\n\n\u201cWe have lost the momentum from large companies \u2013 startups have emerged as a new momentum for Korea,\u201d he said.\n\nOne startup that moved into the hub just over a month ago is Amuse Travel\u2013 a social enterprise that provides tours for people living with disabilities to popular destinations around South Korea, as well as giving people living with disabilities the confidence to travel on their own. The company develops maps of tourist destinations based on data collected during the tours, highlighting the area\u2019s positive and negative aspects \u2013 such as steep inclines, stairs and other barriers to access.\n\nThe company\u2019s founder, Seo-yeon Oh, said it had previously had difficulty raising enough investment, and needed more time to prove its viability of the company. He said Naver had expressed interest in the business.\n\nMoving into the startup hub meant Oh and his staff were able to network with a variety of businesses at various stages of life.\n\n\u201cThe strength of this hub is there is a wide spectrum of startup companies here from fintech to senior citizens, and also \u2026 startup companies which once experienced failure in the past,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cKoreans seem shy, so they seem to work alone or independently, but they also co-work and work together.\u201d\n\nJosh Taylor visited Korea as part of the Walkley Foundation Australia-Korea exchange program, in partnership with the Korea Press Foundation.", "description": "South Korea is proving fertile ground for startups.", "authors": ["Josh Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/700f2692c9d8f7df581d1f03e9812576e4df7b6f/0_223_526_316/master/526.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3499b3d2bf8420b8274d16b536ce3f3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
