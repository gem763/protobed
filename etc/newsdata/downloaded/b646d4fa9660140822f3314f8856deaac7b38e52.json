Antifa Goons Get Thrashed By Federal Protective Service As They Attack An ICE Facility", "language": "en", "text": "Yesterday, a couple of thousand people showed up in Portland for the Climate Strike. This was a coordinated worldwide event in which the least educated and most credulous among us demanded that the rest of us join them in moving society back to the Stone Age. [Every once in a while I muse over just how few of the Michael Mann types would survive in the society they are trying to create where there would be no major income streams of grant money, they would have to actually work to survive, and we might be inclined to hunt them for sport.]\n\nAs you know, you can\u2019t have a demonstration in Portland without antifa or bloc or whatever they are calling themselves. So, naturally, they set out to attack the DHS/ICE facility in Portland. That\u2019s when they found out that they weren\u2019t opposed by Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler\u2019s ineffectual and anarchist-sympathetic police force but by people who took their duties and responsibilities seriously.\n\nAfter the \"climate strike\" protest in Portland yesterday, around 50 masked antifa militants descended near the local ICE facility. They threw projectiles and rocks at officers. This is what happened when (federal, not local) police initiated an arrest. https://t.co/lxM8TglxNN pic.twitter.com/nsyxhMWZUM \u2014 Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) September 21, 2019\n\nIt is really a shame that no one has yet identified the noxious little toad who appears at 0:23 because it would be a service to the nation to treat him the way that CNN treats a meme maker.\n\nAfter the \u201cclimate strike\u201d march ended, masked antifa amassed at a park near the Portland ICE facility. They began to throw rocks and projectiles at police officers. pic.twitter.com/UHJNCYHlWZ \u2014 Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) September 20, 2019\n\nThe antifa suspect sans mask has been detained. pic.twitter.com/RdZcSL0jCB \u2014 Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) September 20, 2019\n\nFederal DHS police\u2014not the Portland Police\u2014searched the antifa suspect for weapons before he was taken inside the vehicle. The suspect was allegedly one of the antifa militants who threw projectiles (rocks) at them. The rest of the masked antifa people ran away. pic.twitter.com/HTiATGHGLi \u2014 Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) September 20, 2019\n\nNot surprisingly, these clowns are major league p***ies when they aren\u2019t hitting people from behind with bicycle locks\n\nDHS and ICE have just brutally attacked us after standing and chanting infront of their building for nearly a minute. No warning, nothing, and now 2 of our comrades have been arrested, one youth comrade was put into a seizure from the attack.\n\nWE NEED JAIL SUPPRT NOW.#Defendpdx pic.twitter.com/dda7g9Qg8m \u2014 PNW Youth Liberation Front (@PNWYLF) September 20, 2019\n\nStudents were attacked by ICE agents during today's #GlobalClimateStrike in Portland. This video shows one of the agents drop a loaded magazine next to a kid and then threatened to shoot them.\n\nThe American gestapo is out of control. #AbolishICE pic.twitter.com/sgupG9A6F6 \u2014 DirectActionAlliance (@DirectActionPDX) September 21, 2019\n\nToday during #ClimateStrike demonstrations, law enforcement attacked a protest outside of the #Portland ICE facility, as members of the youth led @PNWYLF, were simply chanting and holding banners. Police shot numerous projectiles at close range and then made arrests. pic.twitter.com/a3U9DM6GCJ \u2014 It's Going Down (@IGD_News) September 21, 2019\n\nWhat sniveling little b****es they are.\n\nIf more police forces aggressively confronted this nonsense\u2026and more prosecutors took this nascent terrorism seriously and started charging felonies\u2026this crap would cease. As it is, it is pretty inevitable that eventually one of these clashes is going to turn deadly and leave some of these cretins dead and we\u2019ll have to pretend that we are sad or something.", "description": "VIDEO.
