It's Cory Booker,' Porter says in his introduction.\n\nBooker, who is played by SNL cast member Chris Redd, tries to burnish his credentials with the LGBTQ community by bragging that his girlfriend, Rosario Dawson, acted in the film adaptation of the musical Rent.\n\nSenator Cory Booker, who is played on the left by SNL cast member Chris Redd, has trouble answering a question about his past views on gays asked by audience member Aidy Bryant (right)\n\n'So, yeah, I get it,' Booker deadpans.\n\nBooker is then confronted with a question from an audience member who asks him if he's always been a member of the gay community.\n\n'Absolutely, yes,' Booker nervously insists. 'I have nothing but respect since day one.'\n\n'But in 1992...' the audience member continued, to which Booker replied: 'Uh oh.'\n\nThe audience member, played by Aidy Bryant, quizzed Booker about an op-ed he wrote while he was a student at Stanford University.\n\nBooker wrote in the op-ed that he was 'disgusted by gays' and 'hated gays.'\n\nHe wrote that the 'thought of two men kissing each other was about as appealing as a frontal lobotomy.'\n\nBooker notes that the op-ed describes how his views about homosexuals evolved and that he was proud of what he wrote.\n\nBut in the SNL cold open, the spoofed version of Booker says: 'I don't want you to think I'm dodging the question, so I'm going to go now.'\n\nPorter then introduces the next candidate who is 'representing the House of Booty-gig.'\n\nSNL co-head writer Colin Jost comes out on stage as South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nJost spoofs Buttigieg as a wooden, stiff person who has trouble moving his arms.\n\n'I went to Harvard but they don't teach you where to put your arms,' he says.\n\nButtigieg is then asked to respond to 'those who say you're not gay in the right way.'\n\n'There's no wrong way to be gay, unless you're Ellen this week,' Buttigieg says.\n\nThe joke is a reference to Ellen DeGeneres, the talk show host who was widely criticized by liberals after being photographed palling around with George W. Bush at a Dallas Cowboys football game last Sunday.\n\nButtigieg then says: 'Why am I not winning? I'm a veteran, under the legal retirement age, and when I talk it makes sense. Is something wrong with me?'\n\nTo which Cooper responds: 'No, no. You're great guy, just like, as a friend, not for president.'\n\n'Oh. Yeah, that makes sense,' Buttigieg says.\n\nPorter then introduces Warren, saying: 'Warren-ing! Warren-ing! The senator is here!'\n\nMcKinnon's Warren then bursts out onto the stage, pumping her fists and hamming it up for the crowd.\n\n'I'm so excited to be here, Anderson,' she says. 'I had some apple slices backstage and they are hitting me like cocaine!'\n\nShe then adds: 'You all know I'm not a lesbian, but all the ingredients are there!'\n\nThe sketch then spoofs the question Warren was asked at the town hall by an audience member who wondered how she would respond if someone opposed gay marriage on religious grounds.\n\nIn real life, Warren was asked the question on Thursday at a town hall in Ohio by Human Rights Campaign board member Morgan Cox.\n\n'You\u2019re on the campaign trail and a supporter approaches you and says, \"Senator, I\u2019m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman,\"' Cox asked her.\n\nAsked for her response, Warren answered: 'I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that, and I\u2019m just going to say: then just marry one woman,' she said, to laughs.\n\n'I'm cool with that,' she added, to sustained applause from the crowd.\n\nWarren shrugged her shoulders, then came in with a smack-down: 'Assuming you can find one,' she said.\n\nThe clip immediately drew posts on Twitter and other platforms, with some commentators pointing to the viral moment and others saying it could show a lack of attentiveness to socially conservative voters who hold sway in some battleground states.\n\nIn the SNL cold open, McKinnon satirizes Warren's witty comments.\n\n'Oh, snap, the library is open and Miss Thing is about to get read,' Porter says.\n\nWarren, who at this point puts on a pair of purple shades, then replies: 'I would say, sir, tell me your bus stop, because I want to know where you get off.'\n\nShe then says: 'If someone doesn't want to serve gay people at their small business, I bet that's not the only thing that's small.'\n\n'And when people say gay and trans people shouldn\u2019t be included in Civil Rights Act protections, I wished their parents had used protection.'\n\nWarren then breaks into a dance and pulls off a wig to reveal a bald head - a spoof of drag queen Sasha Velour when she won the ninth season of RuPaul's Drag Race in 2017.\n\nPorter then introduces the next guest 'from the house of urban deliciousness' - Julian Castro.\n\nIn real life, Castro served as the head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration.\n\nMiranda's Castro then emerges on stage saying: 'So happy to be here. Look, I even got a participation ribbon.'\n\n'Now, come on, cut to the chase, when do the Queer Eye guys come out? I wanna go rock climbing with Karamo.'\n\nCooper then informs Castro that he isn't appearing on the Netflix show Queer Eye - the reboot of the Bravo series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.\n\nThe reality show depicts a group of homosexual men who give tips to a heterosexual man in need of a makeover in fashion, grooming, design, and lifestyle.\n\n'This isn't Queer Eye, senator,' Cooper says.\n\nCastro corrects Cooper, saying: 'Actually, it's secretary.'\n\n'I wouldn't tell people that,' Cooper says.\n\nAn audience member then asks Castro: 'If elected [president], what would you do to bring queer voices into your cabinet?'\n\nTo which Castro replies: 'Well, first of all, gracias!'\n\n'As a Democrat, I want to apologize for not being gay,' he says. 'But I promise to do better in the future.'\n\nCastro continues: 'I'm Latino, which we can all agree is something.'\n\n'I'm young, I'm diverse, I'm Latinobama,' Castro says. 'Let's get that hashtag going - Latinobama.'\n\nHe then makes reference to 'another man who left his mark on this nation's history but he never became president.'\n\nMiranda then briefly morphs into a character from his hit Broadway show Hamilton, the musical about the life of American founding father Alexander Hamilton, before Cooper snaps him back to reality.\n\n'I was going to say Al Gore,' Castro says. 'Come on.'\n\nCastro then leaves the stage, saying: 'Remember to vote for me for vice president.'\n\nHe then kicks himself for forgetting to say 'president' instead of 'vice president.'\n\nThe sketch concludes with Biden, played by Harrelson - or as Porter refers to him, 'the Delaware daddy whose only vice is the choo choo train.'", "description": "Lin-Manuel Miranda, the composer behind the Broadway hit Hamilton, spoofed Julian Castro, the lone Latino candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, during SNL's cold open.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/04/19645012-0-image-a-34_1570938956962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
