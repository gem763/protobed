Instagram/Cleopatra_x3\n\nLast week, a woman known on Instagram as Cleopatra posted several Instagram Stories showing herself and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq at a meeting together.\n\nThe videos quickly went viral, with netizens speculating that she was the minister\u2019s personal assistant, and either a transvestite or transgender.\n\nOn Tuesday (Oct 22), the minister clarified that she was neither.\n\nThe woman also posted a picture of herself, heavily pregnant, adding that she was a single mother of two.\n\nFollowing wild rumours that she was Sports Minister Syed Saddiq\u2019s girlfriend, assistant, or either a transvestite or transgender individual, the woman spotted in a recent viral video with the minister has come out to clarify that she is a mother of two.\n\nThe woman, who is of Chinese and Dutch descent and goes by name Cleopatra on Instagram, shot to fame after posting a series of Instagram Stories last week featuring herself and several others shaking hands with the Youth and Sports Minister, and sitting down during a meeting in his office.\n\nIn one video, Cleopatra, dressed in a peach-coloured baju and carrying a pink handbag, sat down directly to the minister\u2019s left, while the men remained standing.\n\nIn another, she wrote \u201cmeeting with Cleo International\u201d.\n\nShe also posted several pictures of Syed Saddiq at the meeting on her account.\n\nNetizens dissected the photos and videos, with some speculating she could be the minister\u2019s new girlfriend or a pretty personal aide.\n\nOthers claimed she was a transgender woman, with some calling her a pondan (transvestite).\n\nTransgender individuals are often discriminated against in Malaysia, while cross-dressing and sodomy are illegal.\n\nOo bukan pondan la ni?sajat pondan dan ibu. Knp x tulis padahal seorang wanita \u2014 Eamon (@aieyman_) October 23, 2019\n\nBtw, I am not saying she is pondan, but pondan also can be a mother (adopting babies\u201d like Sajat. Her very bold appearance is suspiciously \u201cpondan\u201d thats why people buat fitnah. We can\u2019t stop fitnah, but we can minimise. Prevention is better than cure. Dress code please!\ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Molly Zalani (@MollyMustika) October 23, 2019\n\nIn response to the rumours, Syed Saddiq clarified in a Twitter post on Tuesday (Oct 22) that the woman was neither a transvestite nor his assistant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why she became the focus, when there were six others in the group. They are from a gaming company and came to discuss a merger, and that\u2019s that,\u201d The Star quoted him as saying to reporters.\n\nAccording to the Malay Mail, the company pitched a youth initiative programme to the minister.\n\n\u201cGossip and slander have no separation in the political world,\u201d the minister added on Twitter. \u201cCan we please focus on real rakyat (people\u2019s) issues?\u201d\n\nDalam Dunia Politik,Gosip & Fitnah, berpisah tiada. Sampai isu anak muda yang penting ditenggelamkan kerana gosip. Sekejap dengar dia PA saya (Padahal tiada). Sekejap dengar dia \u201cPondan\u201d (Padahal seorang ibu). Dapat kontrak?Fitnah!
