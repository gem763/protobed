One might think that, under the circumstances, the president and his attorney might want to lower the temperature with Trump\u2019s former national security adviser after Fiona Hill\u2019s testimony. Instead, Giuliani wasted no time in trolling Bolton over Hill\u2019s reports about his reaction to Giuliani\u2019s work in Ukraine.\n\nHis conversation with New York Magazine\u2019s Olivia Nuzzi wasn\u2019t too bad:\n\nI asked Rudy Giuliani, \u201cIf you had to describe yourself as a weapon other than a hand grenade what weapon would you be?\u201d Giuliani responded, \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in John it\u2019s almost like projection.\u201d \u2014 Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) October 15, 2019\n\nI asked Giuliani if Bolton ever tried to talk to him about this issue before he exited the White House. Giuliani responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u2014 Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) October 15, 2019\n\nThe comment reported by NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker, on the other hand, is pure reactive counterpunch with no strategic consideration whatsoever:\n\n.@RudyGiuliani on Bolton calling him a \u201chand grenade.\u201d RG: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that his bitterness drives him to attack a friend falsely\u2026It\u2019s really ironic that John Bolton is calling anyone else a hand grenade. When John is described by many as an atomic bomb . \u201c \u2014 Kristen Welker (@kwelkernbc) October 15, 2019\n\nThat may be true, but perhaps more true than Giuliani realizes. Atomic bombs usually mean game over, which is why one does not lightly choose to start banging on them with a hammer. Calling Bolton a liar in public \u2014 especially when it wasn\u2019t Bolton who testified in the first place \u2014 is practically daring the former nat-sec adviser to set the record straight, either in public or in House testimony.\n\nOne might think a \u201cfriend\u201d would have checked first to see if Hill\u2019s testimony was accurate in that regard before assuming the worst. And especially before assuming the worst in remarks to the national media this administration professes to detest.\n\nThe media has certainly noticed Giuliani\u2019s decision to go on the attack. It is having the unintended but unsurprising effect of painting Bolton as a potential hero \u2026 a media take that few could have imagined just a few months ago:\n\n\u201cHero\u201d is, of course, a relative term when it comes to Bolton. Newsweek will only go so far as to note a description of Bolton as the Severus Snape of Ukraine-Gate:\n\nFormer National Security Adviser John Bolton is trending after it emerged he had described President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani as a hand grenade, and said he was not part of \u201cwhatever drug deal\u201d was being cooked up between White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon D. Sondland. \u2026 And his efforts to distance himself from the alleged activities were widely discussed on social media\u2014with some expressing surprise that Bolton, who had previously argued for pre-emptive attacks on North Korea and has been criticized for his aggressive foreign policy views, was emerging as the hero of the piece. Indeed, former White House aide Andrei Cherny, currently the CEO of financial firm Aspiration, commented that Bolton\u2019s involvement painted him as the \u201cSeverus Snape\u201d of the story\u2014a reference to the Harry Potter series in which Snape finally emerges as a hero, having been previously painted as a villain by author J.K. Rowling.\n\nThat sets up a call for Bolton to appear on Capitol Hill with lots of political freight and media attention, which is exactly the opposite of what this administration needs. It furthermore increases Bolton\u2019s credibility in the media, which will be a problem for Trump if Bolton corroborates Hill\u2019s account and has more to add to it. No one knows yet whether that will be the case, but if it is, Giuliani\u2019s doing nothing but add to Bolton\u2019s motivation and raising his profile.\n\nAaron Blake calls Bolton\u2019s sudden emergence as a critical need for Democrats \u201cone of the great ironies\u201d in this situation, and says \u201catomic bomb\u201d might well be an apt description:\n\nNot only is Bolton a potentially motivated witness with little loyalty to Trump, he\u2019s actually got something pulling him in the opposite direction: An almost-religious view of foreign policy. Bolton has often been criticized as strident and overly militaristic, but regardless of the substance of his foreign policy, the point here is that he has strong beliefs that appear to outrank other concerns. That\u2019s important, especially in this moment, because Trump\u2019s foreign policy has veered significantly away from Bolton\u2019s vision \u2014 most recently with his decision to withdraw from northern Syria, which is a decision many hawkish Republicans speak about in dire terms. They speak in terms of Trump having left the United States\u2019 Kurdish allies for \u201cslaughter\u201d at the hands of Turkey, as well as a possible resurgence of ISIS. And if those Republicans are speaking out against Trump like never before, just imagine what Bolton must be thinking right now. One of the great ironies here is that Bolton is perhaps the last person you\u2019d expect to be a key witness for Democrats in their impeachment inquiry, given he\u2019s the man they have derided for so long. And the thing that could give him extra motivation to speak out is a shift away from Republican Party orthodoxy on foreign policy.\n\nYes, irony can certainly be ironic, without a doubt. All of that is yet another reason one does not go banging on atomic bombs, or even drawing attention to them.", "description": "Severus Snape?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cbs-bolton.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
