The Australian dollar bought $0.6851.\n\nThe Chinese yuan was flat at 7.0623 in offshore trade.\n\nThe euro held at $1.1132 with traders looking to euro zone manufacturing and services data and the outcome of a European Central Bank meeting, both due later on Thursday.\n\n\"Small improvements across France, Germany and pan-Eurozone and for both manufacturing, services and composite readings are the consensus expectation,\" National Australia Bank's Head of FX Strategy, Ray Attrill, said in a note.\n\n\"EUR will be sensitive to deviations one side or the other of this.\"\n\nThe ECB is all but certain to leave policy unchanged on Thursday, six weeks after its last meeting at which it launched new asset purchases, a rate cut and a pledge to open the money taps further if needed.\n\nCrypto-currency bitcoin plunged as far as 11% overnight to a 5-month low of $7,258.00 after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sounded downbeat about the prospect of Facebook's crypto project, Libra.\n\nAlso weighing on the digital currency was the announcement from Google that it has achieved a breakthrough in research on a quantum computer.\n\nIf fully developed, a vast computing power of quantum computer is expected to obliterate existing cryptographic technologies.", "description": "The pound has soared 6% in two weeks of volatile trade since British Prime Minister Boris Johnson flagged and then clinched a deal with the EU on the terms of Britain's exit from the bloc.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105839350-1554745813020gettyimages-182251222.jpeg?v=1569980118", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
