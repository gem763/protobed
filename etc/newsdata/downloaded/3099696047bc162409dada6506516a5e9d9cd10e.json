Recognizing that we are in the midst of a youth vaping epidemic, as well as the sudden explosion of vaping-related lung illnesses and deaths, the president rightly sprung into action. Flavors are a gateway to vaping, addiction, illness and even death, and by removing them from the market, we can take a serious bite out of this tragic crisis.\n\nPredictably, vaping giant Juul, who is more than one-third owned by tobacco giant Altria, is quietly trying to chip away at the flavor ban to protect its own profits. Juul notably took pre-emptive action last week to stop selling its flavored vapor pods online. Notably, this action excludes \u201cmenthol-based\u201d products, which includes mint and traditional menthol.\n\nNow, the rumor mill in Washington suggests that the administration may relent and carve these flavors out of the federal regulation, clearly as a result of Big Tobacco\u2019s pressure campaign.\n\nIf this were to happen, it would completely undermine the purpose of the flavor ban. Mint is every bit as much a flavor as mango or cotton candy. Stand at any gas station counter and watch the Juul flavors kids are buying.\n\nThe only people suggesting that mint is not a flavor, apparently, are Big Tobacco lobbyists, who have been upping their lobbying game to keep these flavors on the market. In fact, in 2018, Juul spent $1.6 million on lobbying to fight the FDA, and that number is only increasing; from April-June 2019 alone Juul spent $1.01 million \u2013 its most expensive quarter to date \u2013 to protect these flavors.\n\nIn fact, mint and menthol aren\u2019t just flavors \u2013 they\u2019re the flavors young people most prefer. So far this year, they have accounted for two-thirds of youth use.\n\nThey\u2019re also highly profitable for Juul \u2013 to the tune of $2 billion annually and 70 percent of the company\u2019s total sales. This is an existential issue for Juul, hence the quiet lobbying campaign.\n\nSo, we have a situation where the 800-pound gorilla in the e-cigarette market is pushing to reinstate the flavors most popular with youth and most profitable to its own bottom line. Yet the company claims to be a partner with the government in combating youth use. Who on earth could believe them? Is the cynical public relations move of preemptively ending sales of non-mint and menthol vapor supposed to convince us of anything? Why in the world would we trust their PR efforts at all?\n\nEarlier this month, a number of conservative organizations released a letter supporting the president\u2019s proposed flavor ban. In it, they wrote, \u201cUntil e-cigarette companies are willing to abide by current restrictions on youth sales and further research is conducted by the CDC and FDA regarding the health consequences associated with e-cigarettes/vaping, we approve of the Trump Administration\u2019s decision to halt flavored e-cigarettes to protect consumers, particularly youth.\u201d\n\nThe goal is obvious, and stated at the end of that passage: Protect consumers, particularly youth. The objective of Juul and Big Tobacco is also obvious: Protect profits, period. The Trump administration should not be duped by this shameless ploy to pad e-cigarette company profits. The Administration must stand strong, and commit to a true, all-encompassing flavor ban that protects young people.\n\nChad Connelly is the Founder and CEO of Faith Wins and the former director of faith engagement for the Republican National Committee.", "description": "Recently, the Trump administration took the laudable step of announcing .10/26/2019 2:41:06AM EST.", "authors": ["Chad Connelly", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/112/9780875b-0873-4ceb-bd2a-3c389a107113.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
