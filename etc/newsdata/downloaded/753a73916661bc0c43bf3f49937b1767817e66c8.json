The typhoon that is due to strike Tokyo overnight has forced Australia to postpone their departure from Sydney by 24 hours and, amid forecasts of heavy rain and \u201chistoric\u201d winds of up to 130mph, England\u2019s scheduled arrival in Japan on Monday could yet be blown off course.\n\nDelay or no delay, it is a timely reminder for England to expect the unexpected in east Asia. Not for nothing has Jones been shuttling his players around between multiple different training bases in an effort to replicate what awaits them in Japan. This summer alone they have had camps in Bagshot, Teddington, Bristol and Treviso before heading to Newcastle for their final warm-up game and flying out of Heathrow on Sunday night. Their reward if they can reach the tournament\u2019s last weekend will be a further eight weeks away from familiar home comforts.\n\nAustralia\u2019s departure for Rugby World Cup delayed by Typhoon Faxai Read more\n\nAll the hard work and sacrifices will, of course, be worth it should the Webb Ellis Cup be hoisted on 2 November. Jones has constantly been delivering that same message, stressing the need to dig ever deeper on a daily basis. His captain Owen Farrell, though, accepts that not every challenge can be entirely planned for. \u201cYou never know what could happen. You have got to be as prepared as you can but, at the same time, you have got to be ready to deal with anything. We will make sure we\u2019re calm enough to do that.\u201d\n\nTravel disruption, injuries, suspensions, the bounce of the ball \u2026 all the usual imponderables have to be factored in. So, more unusually, must the unique cultural setting England and the other competing nations are heading into. The Japanese language tuition and bowing lessons given to players sound like minor details but, in terms of swift acclimatisation, every little bit helps.\n\nOut on the pitch, though, it is unlikely England\u2019s tactics will lose much in translation. Their campaign will be based squarely on powerful ball carriers making frequent dents, winning collisions and keeping going until their opponents are out on their feet. Friday\u2019s 37-0 victory over Italy, for all its initial sluggishness, further underlined why England will be awkward to beat in Japan. Even on days when they struggle for rhythm their defensive work-rate is significant and their fitness makes them hard to outlast in the final quarter.\n\nThe Italy coach, Conor O\u2019Shea, is among those who believe England\u2019s power runners, if given the opportunity, can propel their team a long way. \u201cI think any team that beats England is going to win the World Cup,\u201d he predicted. \u201cTheir game is predicated on getting over the gainline and huge explosivity. Look at their raw power and their natural winners \u2026 they\u2019ve got so many winners in that group from Saracens. They\u2019ll be at fever pitch come the World Cup.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Italy head coach Conor O\u2019Shea says England power runners are key to success in Japan. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nO\u2019Shea\u2019s team also lost 47-19 to France in a warm-up fixture but according to the former Harlequins\u2019 director of rugby there will be only one winner of the Anglo-French contest in Pool C in Yokohama on 12 October. He rates England as the better team \u201cby a stretch\u201d, particularly if Kyle Sinckler, Billy Vunipola, Manu Tuilagi et al start rumbling in concert. As an Irishman, though, he adds that nothing is ever guaranteed. \u201cThey are a powerful side but if they get out of their pool they\u2019ve still got Wales or Australia lying in wait. It\u2019s the most open tournament you\u2019ve ever seen. You can\u2019t call anything. It\u2019s going to be an incredible World Cup.\u201d\n\nOld instincts of World Rugby are preventing a true global union Read more\n\nEven Italy, reckons O\u2019Shea, could create a ripple or two if they can replicate their concerted effort in the first 50 minutes at St James\u2019s Park. \u201cIf we\u2019d have played with that level of commitment against France last week I think we\u2019d have run them pretty close. If we play like that in our first two pool games we\u2019ll have no problems against Namibia and Canada. Then we\u2019ll lie in wait. Everyone can write us off but there\u2019s ability in this team. Any given Sunday, something special can happen. Things will stick one day.\u201d\n\nThere will be plenty of other coaches saying similar things even if they have to face Ireland, officially now ranked number one in the World Rugby rankings. England still have a slight tendency to blow hot and cold but the aggregate scoreline against the Irish so far this year is currently 89-35 in their favour. If their optimum first-choice side now probably contains George Ford at 10 and Farrell at 12, with Tom Curry and Sam Underhill alongside Billy Vunipola in the back-row, they can rotate their cast if required to suit certain opponents and conditions.\n\nOn that basis they should be as competitive as any England Rugby World Cup side since 2003. Farrell, though, is not about to get carried away or make comparisons with the 2015 squad. \u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to other people. We\u2019re in a tough group but it\u2019s exciting to play against some big teams. At World Cups you\u2019ve got to make sure you keep building throughout and keep learning from the games. We are looking forward to it, we are excited about it, and we want to make sure we train and play like that. There\u2019s still a lot left in us. That\u2019s a good place to be in.\u201d", "description": "England\u2019s management has instilled a calm in the World Cup squad that captain Owen Farrell believes will ensure they can deal with any unforeseen problems in Japan", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a066e11a42dcb3354688e6e3f6f430657c3c3117/0_92_4316_2590/master/4316.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dd824db0e6a649ca935cef0376f22ad2", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
