Too soon,\" one told Ben.\n\n\"This idiot must have done that before. Even worse they have water,\" tweeted another.\n\n\"Sorry, but there is no way on earth I could drink me own wee. I'd rather drink sea water,\" cried a third.\n\nViewers also voiced their shock at the antics of Marco and Ivor during the Channel 4 premiere.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nThe pair caused outrage when they told the others they were hunting for water whilst 'selfishly' looking for money to hide from their new pals.\n\nFans called out their 'snakey' methods on social media, branding the duo 'vile' and 'selfish' and 'next level disgusting.'\n\nMarine Marco became self-appointed leader of the group early on but viewers at home are already anticipating his downfall.", "description": "The Island stars made a cheeky remark in return for some fresh water on the Channel 4 show", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527491.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bear-Grylls.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
