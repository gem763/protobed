It\u2019s the Pixelbook Go, a simple and clean 13.3-inch laptop that starts at $649 and has a total of four configuration options that cost up to $1,399.\n\nI poked around at the Pixelbook Go for about an hour last week, and \u2014 true to the comprehensive leak 9to5Google posted last week \u2014 I think it\u2019s a very nice-looking and nice-feeling laptop. It certainly needs to be, as it\u2019s competing directly with many excellent Chromebooks that cost less. Google\u2019s other big differentiator is the claim that the Pixelbook Go can last 12 hours on a charge\n\nThe main thing to know about the Pixelbook Go is that it is a dead-ahead laptop with a touchscreen. The top doesn\u2019t rotate 360-degrees into tablet mode. After the Pixel Slate fiasco, Google scuttled its plans to make more Chrome OS-based tablets and just went back to basics.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go comes in two colors with Google\u2019s typically cutesy names: just black and not pink. Of the two, I prefer the pink one, which is more like a slightly tinted sandstone (but it should have just called it pink).\n\nAs it has with Pixel phones in the past, Google has opted for a painted metal finish on the Pixelbook Go. The body is made out of magnesium instead of aluminum, and Google tells me that Magnesium apparently has a better strength-to-weight ratio, which meant it could use less material and keep the cost down.\n\nThe most noticeable physical attribute is on the bottom, which is ribbed for an easier grip. On the pink model, it is a loud shade of orange that actually looks great in person. Though it looks rubberized, it\u2019s the same material as the rest of the laptop.\n\nSet aside that design pop, and the most important design note is that the Pixelbook Go is defined by soft, rounded corners. The edges of the laptop curve into each other gently, making the whole thing a sort of giant, flattened lozenge.\n\nOpen it up, and you\u2019ll find a 13.3-inch 1080p display surrounded by bezels that are reasonable in 2019 but certainly not small. There\u2019s a 4K \u201cMolecular Display\u201d option at the very high end, but for $1,400, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it for basically anybody. I used a 1080p version, and it looked like a fairly standard laptop LCD, but I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it in difficult lighting conditions.\n\nI prefer the original Pixelbook\u2019s 3:2 display to this more standard 16:9 panel, but the size does make the Pixelbook Go more portable. It weighs 2.3 pounds and is a half-inch thick, though, which is reasonable but not the thinnest thing you will find on the market. Because all of the edges are so curved, the whole thing feels smaller than it actually is.\n\nThe keyboard is flanked by two long speaker grilles, and when you\u2019re looking at it open, it definitely gives off MacBook vibes \u2014 in an alternate reality where the MacBook had a good keyboard.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the keyboard. I need to tamp down on my enthusiasm for it since I\u2019ve only pecked at it for a very short period of time, but if I just let myself go, I would say that it is the best thing I\u2019ve typed on in years. Don\u2019t hold me to that, though. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m very optimistic about it. There is still a Google Assistant key on the lower left, and it pops up that interface very quickly (with the default to letting you type right away, too).\n\nIt is a small iteration on the original Pixelbook, which was already excellent. Google found a way to make it even quieter than before. Compared to the clackety racket a MacBook makes, this keyboard seems virtually silent. The keys have a longer travel and are made of a softer material, so they feel much better to type on as well. My only gripe is that they kept the same gray color, which makes seeing the letters in dim lighting difficult.\n\nThe base, $649 Pixelbook Go has an Intel 8th Gen Core m3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. That\u2019s slightly better in some ways than the big group of near-identical Chromebooks that cost around $550, but it still isn\u2019t especially impressive. If you step up to the Core i5 or i7, you will still be getting 8th Gen chips, and they\u2019ll still be the lower-power Y-series variety. There are no fans, at least.\n\nPixelbook Go specs Processor: 8th Gen Intel Core m3, i5, or i7\n\nRAM: 8GB / 16GB of RAM\n\nStorage: 64GB / 128GB / 256GB SSD\n\nWeight: 2.3 pounds (FHD)\n\nThickness: 0.5 inches / 13.4 mm\n\nBattery: Claimed 12 hours, with fast charge\n\nDisplay: 13.3-inch, 16:9 touchscreen; HD (1920 x 1080) or 4K (3840 x 2160)\n\nCamera: Front-facing 2MP, 60 fps, 1080p video\n\nWi-Fi: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, 2x2 (MIMO), dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz)\n\nBluetooth: 4.2\n\nThere are two USB-C ports \u2014 one on each side \u2014 and it supports fast charging. Google says you can get \u201ctwo hours of use in just 20 minutes of charge.\u201d There\u2019s a headphone jack, too, which is a blessing given Google\u2019s dicey history with Bluetooth on Chromebooks. I\u2019m told the Pixelbook Go has a new and better module for Bluetooth.\n\nYou won\u2019t find any storage expansion slots, which is a bit of a disappointment as microSD was nearly becoming an expected standard on other Chromebooks.\n\nYou also won\u2019t find a fingerprint sensor, nor can you log in with your face as you can on the new Pixel 4, the iPad Pro, and many Windows computers. Google wanted to keep the cost down, but if you have an Android phone, you can use the fingerprint sensor on that to unlock your Chromebook. And there\u2019s a Titan C security chip as well.\n\nPerformance seemed fine in my time with it. But then it should, as the combination of Chrome OS and Intel is fairly stable and mature these days. And since Google isn\u2019t trying to extend Chrome to be a tablet OS on this particular machine, all the lag and hassle from those efforts is simply not here.\n\nGoogle is offering four different configurations, which, to my mind, is one configuration too many. Here they are:\n\n$649: 8GB RAM, 64GB SSD, FHD, 8th Gen Intel Core m3\n\n$849: 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, FHD, 8th Gen Intel Core i5\n\n$999: 16GB RAM, 128GB SSD, FHD, 8th Gen Intel Core i5\n\n$1,399: 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, UHD, 8th Gen Intel Core i7\n\nNormally, I\u2019d say that the i5 is the one most people should get, but a $200 jump for that storage and processor is fairly hefty. My advice is to wait for the reviews to see how the base model performs.\n\nOh, and if you prefer the 3:2 screen or 360-degree hinge on the original Pixelbook, it\u2019s not going anywhere. Neither, unfortunately, are its largish bezels and flaky Bluetooth. I use the Pixelbook every day and love it, but Google chose not to update it this year.\n\nOddly, Google has to stagger not just the release of the Pixelbook Go but also preorders. Preorders for the just black $649 and $849 configs open today for the US and Canada. The two more expensive configs are \u201ccoming soon,\u201d and all of the not pink configs will have a waitlist. The preorders you can put in today should begin shipping within a couple of weeks.", "description": "For the first time, Google is making a Chromebook that actually approaches a reasonable price for most people instead of strictly catering to the high end.
