It announced it would appeal the decision in February 2019.", "description": "ASIC had been hoping to use the dispute as a \u201ctest case\u201d to provide much-needed clarity on the legal line between personal and general advice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2965%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_41/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/de5332e537a037aae346539210b345ac9178370a", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
