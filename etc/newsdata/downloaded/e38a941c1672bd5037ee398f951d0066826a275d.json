These threats have become background noise.\n\nUS In the past year alone, we've seen multiple residents convicted of supporting ISIS or scoping out terror targets for Hezbollah.\n\nWe also saw a former US infantryman charged with trying to set off a bomb in Long Beach, California, and a Syrian-born resident of Pittsburgh charged with planning an attack on a church in the name of ISIS.\n\nThese are just some of the foiled Jihadist plots that we know about.\n\nBut in the past year, we've been forced to confront a growing threat from another form of violent extremism: white nationalist terrorism.\n\nWe've seen the deadliest attack targeting Latinos in recent US history at a Walmart in El Paso. We've seen an attack on a synagogue near San Diego, which echoed the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, believed to be the largest massacre of Jewish-Americans in our history.\n\nThese terror suspects echoed white supremacist conspiracy theories about \"replacement,\" hatred toward immigrants and refugees and ambitions of sparking a race war.\n\nAnd then there are the would-be attacks thwarted by law enforcement, including an arrest of an Ohio man who police say threatened a Jewish community center and the arrest of a Coast Guard officer , with a massive weapons cache, who prosecutors say was plotting to kill Democrats and journalists.\n\nThis is a growing problem. The FBI reports that of domestic terrorism cases with a racial component, most are linked to white supremacy.\n\nAnd here's a startling statistic: since the 9/11 attacks, right-wing terrorists have killed more people in America than jihadist terrorists, according to the New America think tank\n\nThere are some folks who, for their own political purposes, would like to keep the focus on one form of political violence over another.\n\nBut that would be unwise.\n\nBecause we don't have the luxury of choosing which threats we face.\n\nAnd there's a strong case to be made that these opposing terrorist threats actually echo each other, as my colleague Jim Sciutto and others have argued.\n\nTerrorism is a weaponized version of tribalism, motivated by fear and finding identity in their hatred of \"the other.\" As Max Fisher of the New York Times wrote, \"In both, there is the apocalyptic ideology that predicts -- and promises to hasten -- a civilizational conflict that will consume the world.\"\n\nGet our weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.
