Josh Hawley, a top tech industry critic.\n\nAccompanied by an entourage that included Facebook's global policy chief, Joel Kaplan, and trailed by a sea of reporters and TV cameras, Zuckerberg brushed off media questions as he huddled behind closed doors with Hawley (R-Mo.) and other GOP senators, including Tom Cotton of Arkansas, John Cornyn of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHawley told reporters after his meeting with Zuckerberg that he called on the Facebook CEO to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 two of the company's biggest acquisitions that have drawn scrutiny in Washington. Spinning off those assets, Hawley said, would prove Facebook is serious about addressing concerns over competition and privacy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they should do. They should spin them off,\u201d the senator said. \u201cSell them right now and show that you have confidence in the core product, in the core Facebook product, prove that you don\u2019t have to buy companies to innovate \u2026 prove that you\u2019re not afraid of competition.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg was \"not receptive to those suggestions,\" he added.\n\nHawley said he also raised \"the censorship issue\" and claimed the Facebook CEO acknowledged that \"bias is an issue they have struggled with internally for years.\" Republicans have been ramping up accusations that the big internet companies silence conservative voices on their platforms.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said that Zuckerberg's remarks to Hawley were about the \"perception of bias\" in Silicon Valley, and that \"he went on to say it is something about which we need to be aware.\"\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), too, pressed Zuckerberg on \"bias against conservatives on Facebook\u2019s platform,\" according to a Lee spokesperson. Their discussion spanned government regulation, antitrust enforcement, privacy issues and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that shields websites like Facebook from liability over content posted by users, the spokesperson said.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

While Democrats primarily want the social media giant to get rid of disinformation and hate speech, Republicans have dangled the prospect of weakening the liability protection if Facebook doesn't end political \"censorship.\"\n\nFacebook has consistently denied demoting conservative speech, and no evidence has emerged of systemic bias at the company. But GOP leaders have seized on individual Facebook takedowns or enforcement actions involving right-leaning accounts to accuse it of viewpoint discrimination.\n\nDuring a dinner with a group of senators on Wednesday night, Zuckerberg got an earful about the company's approach to privacy, competition and election security, according to Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who organized the gathering.\n\n\"I think he understands that self-regulation isn't going to [work],\" said Warner, vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"The days of the Wild West in terms of not just Facebook but all these enterprises can't continue.\"\n\nFacebook has been under intense pressure since the 2016 election, when reports emerged of a wide-ranging Russian disinformation campaign on the social network that sought to promote Donald Trump and disparage his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nAmid the intensifying political heat, Zuckerberg in a March op-ed signaled an openness to regulation on four fronts: online privacy, content moderation, election security and data portability \u2014 the right for users to transfer their personal information between digital services.\n\nIt's Zuckerberg's first trip to Capitol Hill since his high-profile, marathon testimony to Congress last year about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Since then, the company has come under even more government scrutiny over its handling of consumer data, online content and business practices.\n\nFacebook faces an antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and a separate probe by a group of state attorneys general. The Justice Department is also conducting a broad tech industry investigation thought to include Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other 2020 presidential candidates have called for Facebook to be broken up.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a frequent Facebook critic who has backed calls to split up the company, attended Wednesday's dinner with Zuckerberg. Blumenthal said he raised the company's \"repeated failures to protecting election security and consumer privacy.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I\u2019ve been a tough critic of Facebook, so I was glad for the opportunity to discuss my concerns directly with Mr. Zuckerberg,\" he said.\n\n", "description": "The Facebook CEO brushed off media questions as he huddled behind closed doors with Hawley and other GOP senators.", "authors": ["Cristiano Lima"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0d/d9/13ce918341da95324300025860c5/190919-zuckerberg-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
