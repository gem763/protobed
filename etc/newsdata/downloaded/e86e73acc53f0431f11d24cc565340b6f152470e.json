Most Americans probably wouldn\u2019t recognize Kirby Heyborne\u2019s blond waves \u2014 but many Latter-day Saints do. Along with a number of national commercials, including a Snickers spot with Mr. T, Heyborne has played Elder Calhoun in \u201cThe Best Two Years,\u201d a movie about four missionaries in the Netherlands, and Jared in \u201cThe R.M.\u201d (\u201cReturned Missionary.\u201d)\n\n\u201cJust today, I was at Walmart picking up some chocolate milk and the bagger was really friendly to me,\u201d Heyborne said one day last month . \u201cAt the very end \u2014 and you can kind of tell, people get a little twinkle in their eye \u2014 he very kindly said to me, do you like it when people recognize you?\u201d\n\nBut Heyborne has also caught some criticism from the faithful. In 2008, he was in a commercial for Miller Lite, a decision for which he still sometimes gets a scolding . (Latter-day Saints are supposed to abstain from alcohol, coffee, tea and tobacco.) Heyborne is hosting a new show on BYUtv called \u201cMaking Good,\u201d and under a promo video posted on YouTube, one commenter wrote, \u201cHe drank beer. I hate him.\u201d\n\nHeyborne , who is a member of the church, said he did not actually drink the beer.\n\nWhile actors in Utah can become something of a face, they generally can\u2019t convert that into a proper living. Jasen Wade, who has crisp blue eyes and the kind of chin you could use to shave ice, said that when he works as a leading man in these independent movies \u2014 most of which are low budget affairs shot in just a couple of weeks \u2014 he makes $200 to, occasionally, $450 a day.", "description": "Movies made by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are an important part of a film and TV ecosystem in northern Utah.
