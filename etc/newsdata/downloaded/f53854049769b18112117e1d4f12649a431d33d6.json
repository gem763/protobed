The letter, which was authored by deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, accused the Times of not having \u201cinternalized the sobering lessons of 2016\u201d by giving \u201ctop billing\u201d to a \u201cright-wing polemicist\u201d like Schweizer.\n\n\u201cBut today\u2019s decision is hardly the first example,\u201d Bedingfield wrote, before proceeding to claim the Times had an \u201coutsized hand in the spread of a baseless conspiracy theory\u201d concerning the Biden family. \u201cWhat was especially troubling about the Times\u2019s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting\u2026 this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon.\u201d\n\nThe Times did not take kindly to the accusation, telling CNN in a statement that its prior \u201ccoverage of the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden has been fair and accurate.\u201d The outlet further added it would \u201ccontinue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we\u2019re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of Schweizer, the Times defended its decision to publish his op-ed, noting that, far from being a \u201cright-wing polemicist,\u201d he had expertise in ethics and public corruption through his position as president of the Government Accountability Institute.\n\n\u201cThe op-ed makes an argument that nonpartisan government watchdogs would make, arguing in favor of a law that would prohibit self-dealing by those with government connections,\u201d a spokesperson for the paper said.\n\nBiden\u2019s attack on the Times comes as his son\u2019s business dealings have spilled into the open amid the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Schweizer, who previously chronicled the troubling fundraising practices of the Clinton Foundation, has been at the forefront of the topic since the publication of his bestselling book \u2014 Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends \u2014 in 2018. In particular, Schweizer has exposed how Hunter Biden profited off deals with Ukraine and China that appeared inaccessible to average American businessmen, at the same time his father was responsible for helping formulate the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards both countries.", "description": "The New York Times\u00a0fired back at\u00a0Joe Biden, defending its decision to run an op-ed by Peter Schweizer, an ethics watchdog.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/25327850400_a73d10b948_o-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
