So in April 2018, when my then-ninth grader, Caleb said, \u201cMom, Dad \u2014 I want to talk to you,\u201d my husband and I were all ears.\n\nWhat we heard was alarming.\n\nCaleb had witnessed a \u201cconfusing\u201d presentation about e-cigarettes, given at school that day by a representative from the popular brand Juul. This supposed educator told the class that Juul was intended solely for adult use. Yet in the next breath, he said Juul was \"totally safe\" and that the Food and Drug Administration would be approving it any day \u2014 both complete falsehoods. I\u2019ve told this story before Congress twice, most recently at a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nMint and menthol spared from cuts\n\nOn Thursday, Juul\u2019s duplicity caught my attention yet again, when the company grandly announced that it will no longer sell fruity or dessert-flavored e-cigarettes. In fact what is most significant is what Juul didn\u2019t do: It will not stop selling mint and menthol flavors, the favored choice of two out of every three high school students who vape. Juul\u2019s cynical \u201cnews\u201d changes nothing.\n\nA woman uses an electronic cigarette in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, in October 2019. More\n\nPresident Trump \u2014 parent and policymaker \u2014 one month ago announced that the FDA will soon remove all flavored e-cigarettes from the market. Nothing short of that will be acceptable, and we should all be prepared for more optics and deception from the industry that brought us cigarettes.\n\nDon't repeat our smoking mistakes: Vaping is big business, but it's still early enough to snuff it out\n\nThe fact is, Juul and other e-cigarettes are addicting kids across the country and turning their lives upside down. Nearly 5 million middle and high schoolers in the United States now vape. There are cases of straight-A students failing classes. Athletes are getting so winded they can\u2019t breathe. Formerly even-keeled kids are exploding in anger. Teens are spending weeks in rehab for nicotine addiction or reporting symptoms of withdrawal.\n\nWhen will we protect our kids?\n\nWe\u2019re in a race against time to prevent our children from becoming the next generation of nicotine addicts and from being treated as human guinea pigs in the Juul experiment.\n\nPreliminary results from the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey, released last month, show how quickly the problem is worsening:\n\n\u25baE-cigarette use among high school students reached 27.5% this year, an increase of 135% in the past two years.\n\n\u25baThe number of middle and high school students who use e-cigarettes jumped by nearly 3 million in just two years.\n\n\u25baThe percentage of high school e-cigarette users who reported using mint and menthol flavors increased from 42.3% in 2017 to 63.9% in 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that e-cigarette use has jumped dramatically in just a few years. Juul and other companies have aggressively and cynically marketed sleek, thumb-drive-like products and flavors \u2014 such as mango, mint and menthol \u2014 that appeal to kids while enabling them to camouflage their vaping habits and hide them from the adults in their lives.\n\nOverreacting is the worst reaction: Don\u2019t let fearmongering guide vaping debate\n\nThe research is clear: Most regular youth e-cigarette users report using flavored products and say flavors are a major reason for their use. And with mint and menthol growing in popularity, the administration must reject industry efforts to exempt these flavors from its plan. If mint and menthol flavors remain on the market, even more kids will gravitate to them, and we will not get this epidemic under control.\n\nParents and children should know that e-cigarettes are dangerous for young people. Each Juul pod delivers roughly as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes, and nicotine is harmful for adolescents\u2019 developing brains. It\u2019s also incredibly addictive. And the growing number of serious lung injuries and deaths related to e-cigarette use has added to the urgency of acting now.", "description": "Don't be fooled.
