The next largest divergence occurred in October 2013, when there was an inflow to equity funds of $51.5 billion and an outflow from bonds of $19.2 billion, a difference of $70.7 billion.\n\nDespite rising equity prices so far this month, investors have continued to pull money from equity funds according to data from EPFR Global and Bank of America.\n\nDuring the week ended Sept. 4, investors pulled $8.4 billion from equity exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, while pouring $11.3 billion into bond funds. This continues a trend that has prevailed for most of 2019, wherein equity prices have been steadily rising even as investors pull money out of equity funds.\n\nThe positioning of fund investors is so bearish that Bank of America\u2019s bull and bear indicator is flashing a strong, contrarian buy signal. \u201cWe are bullish,\u201d wrote Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America in a Friday note to clients.\n\nBank of America\n\nHe pointed out that since 2000, when the Bank of America bull and bear indicator flashed \u201cbuy\u201d signals, the median performance for global stocks was a rise of 6.3% over the subsequent three months, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield typically rose by 50 basis points.\n\n\u201cWe say the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.09% and the MSCI All Country World index 892400, +1.15% will retest all-time highs,\u201d Harnnett wrote.", "description": "Equity exchange-traded funds and mutual funds saw outflows of $52 billion in August, versus $29 billion of bond-fund inflows, for a total difference of $81...", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB652_run_aw_ZG_20190109113014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
