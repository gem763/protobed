It boosted Google's overall smartphone sales this summer in a typically slow quarter.\n\nGoogle also has tried to reassure investors that there is no weakness in its YouTube video unit, while expressing confidence in its business overall through share buybacks.\n\nBut cash continues to be spent and higher costs loom as Google deals with clashes with regulators. Total expenses in the third quarter reached $US31.3 billion, about 25 per cent higher than a year ago and topping the previous high of $US31.1 billion in the 2018 fourth quarter.\n\nGoogle in the third quarter acknowledged investigations by the US Congress, Department of Justice and 48 states into the company's competitive practices. It settled a privacy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. It also got an additional 90-day reprieve from an export ban that would restrict its relationship with Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, one of its top partners in distributing mobile apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has said it is cooperating with the increased scrutiny, while saying that it has survived calls for increased regulation many times.\n\nAlphabet, which generates about 85 percent of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total third-quarter revenue of $US40.5 billion. That was up 20 per cent over last year and compared with 19 per cent growth in the second quarter. Analysts on average estimated 19.52 per cent growth and $US40.325 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nNet income for the third quarter rose to $US7.1 billion, or $US10.12 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $US8.811 billion, or $US12.44 per share.\n\nThe operating margin was 23 per cent, down from 24 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nShares of Google closed 1.95 per cent higher in regular trade on Monday. The shares earlier had risen about 2 per cent after Reuters, citing sources, reported Google had made an offer to acquire US wearable device maker Fitbit.\n\nReuters", "description": "Google's parent missed analysts' estimates for quarterly profit\u00a0 as it reported its highest-ever quarterly expenses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/87f5b7273db1a370a27a61713e204a44ece29ca2", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
