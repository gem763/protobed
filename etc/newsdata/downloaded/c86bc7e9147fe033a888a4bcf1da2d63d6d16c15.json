Of the estimated 3,000 missives written by Austen, only around 161 survive, of which around 95 are to Cassandra. The letter, dated 16 September 1813 and written shortly after the publication of Pride and Prejudice, runs to four pages. Dealing with everything from a trip to the dentist with her nieces to her mother\u2019s health (Austen is hopeful she is \u2018no longer in need of leeches\u2019), it is \u2018a gem\u2019, according to Kathryn Sutherland, an Austen scholar and trustee of Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum.\u201d\n\nMatthew Walther reviews Corey Robin\u2019s The Enigma of Clarence Thomas.\n\nWhat is the oldest restaurant in the world? \u201cA tiny trattoria in Rome that specialises in tripe and boasts Caravaggio, Goethe and Keith Richards among its past customers has laid claim to being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant and hopes to knock a Spanish rival out of the record books.\u201d\n\nA complex portrait of Lord Byron: \u201cHis club foot, he thought, made him damaged goods; he blamed this disfigurement on his mother, who wore a corset throughout her pregnancy and refused to remove it when she went into labour. He also had a tendency to obesity, for which his plump mother was likewise held accountable. His remedy was a succession of absurd, obsessive diets, including one that confined him to hard biscuits and soda water, supplemented by tobacco as an appetite suppressant. Byron\u2019s aversion to \u2018animal food\u2019, meaning meat, dramatised his alienation from England, since John Bull proverbially gorged on roast beef. \u2018To be carnivorous,\u2019 Peattie says, \u2018was to be patriotic\u2019 . . . But Byron\u2019s abstinent regime so weakened him that his death in the Greek marshes was as much due to starvation as to the quackery of his doctor, who diagnosed epilepsy and siphoned off half the blood in his body.\u201d\n\nMen and the sea: \u201cThe Boundless Sea is a work of immense scholarship, a forensic tribute to human enterprise. Did you know that Greco-Roman navigators ventured as far as Malaya? That standards of living in Roman Carthage and Alexandria were \u2018perhaps higher than at any time before the 18th century\u2019? That south of Yemen, on the island of Socotra, there is a cave beloved of seafarers who, between the 1st century BC and the 6th century AD, left inscriptions in languages including Sanskrit, Greek, Indian, Persian, Ethiopic and South Arabian, allowing us to trace some of their networks? \u2018A historian ignores the smaller, apparently insignificant places at his or her peril,\u2019 Abulafia notes.\u201d\n\nA 200-year history of bicycles in New York: \u201cNew York has maintained a shaky relationship with its bicyclists since 1819. Back then, people tired of walking or hoofing it around town adopted a European import, the velocipede\u2014a primitive \u201cwheeled contraption\u201d with no pedals. New Yorkers\u2014mostly men\u2014rode these early bicycles through Vauxhall Gardens, City Hall Park, and Bowling Green, but not for long. Just three months after the velocipede made its appearance, city fathers\u2014who happily put up with \u2018carts, carriages, pedestrians, and hogs\u2019\u2014banned the device, imposing a $5 fine on violators. From the beginning, the bicycle was considered a \u2018whimsical invention,\u2019 an unrealistic mode of transportation. It took nearly a half century for the bicycle, much modified, to reappear. Following the Civil War, cycling became trendy again, fulfilling a growing population\u2019s need for transportation and recreation. Dozens of bicycling schools opened citywide for untrained adults. In newly built Central Park, 2,786 bicycles were spotted in one spring month. It didn\u2019t take long before there were \u2018enough\u2019 cyclists to \u2018warrant some public infrastructure.\u2019 Cyclists\u2014not car owners\u2014first lobbied for smooth surfaces, whether concrete or wood, over cobblestone. Yet as cyclists\u2014including, now, some women\u2014traversed the streets for work and leisure, city officials again viewed them as a problem. In 1873, Brooklyn\u2019s common council banned bikes from streets during busy afternoon hours; cyclists could only \u2018exercise\u2019 before 1 p.m.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nIn Spiked, Alex Cameron argues that street art is a crime and should be punished not celebrated:\n\n\u201cStreet art is an individual act that speaks of a chronic lack of consideration for anyone else. Its creators think they know best. They decide what, when and where. The people who live there, and must live with it, don\u2019t have a say. There is no \u2018demand\u2019 for street art from ordinary people, and there is no consensual or participatory impulse on the part of the artist. It is only one person\u2019s view of what should be and what is good for ordinary people. It is the act of an entitled, middle-class narcissist.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Lake Lucerne\n\nPoem: Jim Harrison, \u201cThe Current Poor\u201d\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
