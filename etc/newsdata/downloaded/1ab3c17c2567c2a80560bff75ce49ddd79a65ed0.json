So there\u2019s a lot of sand they can play with.\u201d\n\nA thousand days.\n\n\u201cThank you for the very interesting remarks you just made,\u201d the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, said through his interpreter.\n\n\u201cI have so many Italian friends,\u201d Trump said to Mattarella. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many Italian friends.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s name was all over the news Wednesday, for privately exerting influence on U.S. policy toward Turkey and Ukraine. A business associate of Giuliani\u2019s was arrested Wednesday for allegedly taking part in a campaign-finance scheme. It was the fourth such arrest of a Giuliani associate in the past week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani, for his part, believes that the \u201cdeep state\u201d is out to get him while Hillary Clinton runs free. The president has co-signed this view. \u201cSuch a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA,\u201d Trump recently tweeted. \u201cDeep State. Shameful!\u201d\n\nA thousand days.\n\nAn impeachment inquiry is underway in the House of Representatives, which on Wednesday voted 354 to 60 to oppose Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. Over on the Senate floor, Republican John Cornyn (Texas) dismissed the impeachment inquiry as a \u201cdivisive and ultimately futile effort.\u201d Then Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) took the microphone.\n\n\u201cI want to talk about a very different topic,\u201d Blunt said, \u201cand that is the Stanley Cup.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAll day, C-SPAN had an online channel labeled \u201cHouse Intelligence Committee Stakeout.\u201d It was footage of a stairwell at the Capitol, morgue-like in its yellow dimness. Every now and then, a person walked up or down the stairwell, carrying a binder. Behind closed doors, a 37-year veteran of the State Department was testifying that U.S. diplomacy was being politicized to benefit Trump.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI still ask the FBI: Where is the server?\u201d Trump was saying in the Oval Office, referring to Russia\u2019s hacking of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. \u201cHow come the FBI never got the server from the DNC? Where is the server? I wanna see the server. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s on the server.\u201d\n\nTrump called the U.S. withdrawal from northern Syria a \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d decision that keeps \u201cour soldiers totally safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHis former ISIS adviser, veteran national-security official Brett McGurk, took to Twitter with a sharp rebuke: \u201cTrump has no idea what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nA thousand days.\n\nThe joint news conference with President Mattarella began 54 minutes late in the East Room of the White House.\n\n\u201cTo me it will always be called \u2018Columbus Day,\u2019 \u201d Trump began, referring to the Italian heritage of the explorer. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like that. I do.\u201d Then he called his own election \u201ccorrupt.\u201d And, for at least the fourth time in as many hours, Trump referred to the Kurds as \u201cno angels.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWho is an angel?\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many around.\u201d The United States, he continued, has no place in a conflict between Middle Eastern countries.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq,\u201d tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nTo which Trump replied at the news conference: \u201cLindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years.\u201d\n\nA thousand years. A thousand days. Either way, a lot of sand.\n\nAbout 3 p.m., Trump met with congressional leaders in the White House Cabinet Room to talk about the situation abroad. The meeting devolved. There was some confusion about whether Trump called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d or a \u201cthird-grade politician.\u201d House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who has served in Congress since 1981, said afterward that he\u2019d never seen such disrespect from a president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA nasty diatribe,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Trump\u2019s behavior during the meeting.\n\n\u201cMeasured and decisive,\u201d is how Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary later described it in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI think now we have to pray for his health,\u201d Pelosi said back at the Capitol. \u201cFor this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nAt about the same time, Fox Business anchor Trish Regan released a copy of an official letter sent by Trump to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 9. It said, in part:\n\nLet\u2019s work out a deal! . . . [History] will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\n\nRep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who left the Republican Party in July, reacted to the letter on Twitter by typing: \u201cThis is insane.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The president talks sand in the Middle East, then gets salty with Congress.", "authors": ["Dan Zak", "Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZyISyMw8qZ7fPqRfZ9U7TDricOE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHMVELXQJII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
