PETA passed Marianne some literature on the virtues of veganism, which she accepted as she nodded her head in shame. \u201cI\u2019m trying! I\u2019m trying!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWell, thank you so much! It\u2019s the best thing that you can do for our planet,\u201d one of the activists told her.\n\nMarianne cringed. \u201cI know. I know. I know,\u201d she said apologetically. \u201cYou have me intellectually convinced.\u201d\n\nEventually, when the self-loathing had subsided, she made her way to a black Lincoln Town Car and sped away \u2014 in the rearview mirror were the activists and MSNBC\u2019s climate forum, which took place late last week on the Georgetown campus. (New York was also a partner in the forum, along with Georgetown\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service and Our Daily Planet.)\n\nBut before all that, backstage at the forum, Williamson answered some questions about environmental policy and the media environment that treats her call to mindfulness like a joke.\n\nIs it feasible for the world to stay below two degrees of warming?\n\nWe must. I think that\u2019s what we need to see. This is really an interesting issue. We must be well below. The recent U.N. report on what 1.5 degrees means \u2014\n\nThe U.N. says doing it would require a global World War II\u2013scale mobilization.\n\nThat\u2019s what we need.\n\nBut is that feasible?\n\nIt\u2019s feasible \u2014 we fought World War II and we won. We\u2019ve done it before and we can do it again. But with World War II, everybody understood what Pearl Harbor meant. Everybody understood what the enemy was. We\u2019re so busy making each other the enemy today that we\u2019ve lost sight: We\u2019re so focused on the trees we\u2019ve lost sight of the forest \u2026 We need to mobilize the people before we can mobilize the resources.\n\nWhat is the role of nuclear power in addressing climate change, and do you think we can meet the U.N. 2030 timeline without expanding our nuclear capacity?\n\nI\u2019m against nuclear power. I\u2019m against it.\n\nCan you elaborate?\n\nI think it\u2019s risky. I think that we are living in such a state of denial. I think the same is true with nuclear weapons; we aren\u2019t facing the whole truth here about what would happen if something went wrong. If something goes wrong with a nuclear facility, especially \u2014 we\u2019re playing \u2014 we\u2019re so close \u2014 we are failing to recognize how fragile life is. We are failing to recognize how fragile the ecosystem is. One mistake, one earthquake too close to a nuclear facility \u2014 we saw what happened at Fukushima. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever even totally faced some of the consequences. I think the public is kept in the dark about a lot of the consequences of Fukushima.\n\nSo you don\u2019t think that we should have nuclear weapons?\n\nWell, obviously the United States has about 7,000 right now, but definitely I would want to be a president working in the direction of nonproliferation. Ultimately, that should be our goal for this planet \u2014 no generation should live just for itself any more than any individual should live just for ourselves. We should be thinking about what this planet is going to be 50 years from now, 100 years from now. The U.S. Air Force has ordered 100 B-21 Raiders, and each B-21 Raider costs $560 million and each one drops both conventional and nuclear weapons. Now, you tell me: Why do we need 100 airplanes that drop nuclear bombs?\n\nYou drop five of those, it\u2019s over for human civilization as we know it. You drop ten of those, it\u2019s over for, probably, humanity on this planet. And every nuke that exists today makes Hiroshima and Nagasaki look like a pinprick. What are we doing? And that $560 million for each one of those planes \u2014 think what that would do for 13 million American children who go to school hungry or are hungry, who go to bed hungry, or 43 million Americans in poverty? So yes, absolutely, I believe that we\u2019re talking about is profit for the nuclear industry. We\u2019re not talking about wisdom when we talk about energy or national security.\n\nWell, we\u2019re very good at coming up with funds when it comes to national security, but not \u2014\n\nIsn\u2019t that interesting! Isn\u2019t that interesting!\n\nWhen it comes to poverty, or \u2014\n\nWell, we can when the people demand it.\n\nWill they demand it?\n\nWell, I\u2019m running. So they have an option.\n\nClimate change is a global problem, not just an American one. What can a president do to get the other countries of the world \u2014 especially those like China, India, and Brazil \u2014 onboard?\n\nWe can demonstrate what getting it right looks like. The United States is the most powerful nation on earth. There\u2019s nothing like getting it right yourself.\n\nThere is a lot of arrogance in the concept of American exceptionalism, and other nations, like recently Brazil, have sometims bristled at the idea that another country can tell them what to do on this front.\n\nSo how would you approach conversations or negotiations with other nations without condescending to them?\n\nWell, that\u2019s understandable. [Jair] Bolsonaro\u2014he\u2019s in the same club with Trump and several other leaders with obvious dictatorial tendencies and authoritarian personalities. Right now the Bolsonaros of the world get a wink-wink from Donald Trump. And there are all kinds of ways the United States can exert pressure on different counties. We give a lot of money, we do a lot of trade deals. There are all kinds of ways. The problem is right now that we have a president who gives a wink-wink.\n\nHow would you respond to the people who are ready to laugh you off because you discuss spirituality and the power of hearts and minds or similar themes?\n\nI don\u2019t think that the average American laughs it off at all. I think there\u2019s a political and media elite filled with \u2014 they are not a monolith, but sometimes the political media elite talk about what the people think through the filter of why they think. They think people aren\u2019t ready. That\u2019s not my experience! My career doesn\u2019t show me that people aren\u2019t ready! My experience is that people on the left or the right are more than ready. Its the 21st century!\n\nHow do you puncture cynicism?\n\nI think that with my candidacy I\u2019m seeing that people are not cynical.\n\nBut how do you continue on without being on the debate stage?\n\nWell, I\u2019m here today. I spoke at the 92nd St. Y last night with Jonathan Capehart. I\u2019m still out there. As long as there is a sense that I\u2019m \u2014 you know, Martin Luther King said your life begins to end on the day you stop talking about things that matter. I\u2019m talking about things that, to me, matter. Whether it\u2019s the corruption of an amoral economic system. Millions of traumatized children. Our need for declaring peace. Reparations. A deeper conversation even about climate. As long as I\u2019m speaking and people are showing up and I\u2019m being heard, then I\u2019m here.\n\nWhat do you say to Americans \u2014 mostly on the right \u2014 who do not believe climate change is real?\n\nI don\u2019t think the right is so much filled with people who don\u2019t believe in climate change. I think the right is filled, however, with people who \u2014 let me put it this way: I don\u2019t think the problem is people who don\u2019t believe in climate change. I think we have a problem with how many people on the right do recognize climate change but are not going to vote for people who demean their values.\n\nYou mean a patronizing attitude from the left toward conservatives?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I mean.\n\nHow do you talk to them differently?\n\nI affirm their values because I share them.\n\nCan you elaborate?\n\nWell, President Eisenhower said that the American mind at its best is both liberal and conservative. I\u2019m a liberal. I\u2019m a progressive. I\u2019m way on the left. But I understand that there are high-minded conservative values, and I understand that at the best America is a yin and a yang. There have been places where, even when I come down on the side of a progressive policy, factored into my thinking was a recognition where certain conservative principles had their place. That\u2019s the point of a free society. Nobody has a monopoly on truth. That\u2019s important to remember.\n\nAnd you see as much on the left as on the right, this smug, self-righteous I\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong; and that\u2019s very bad for democracy. We need to be able to hear each other. Like I said, none of us has a monopoly on truth. There\u2019s always something to hear from someone, even if your view or policy [is different]. I\u2019ve noticed many times that my policy position didn\u2019t change but my understanding of the larger issue changed because I talked to an intelligent conservative: And that\u2019s important! And so I don\u2019t think we should make the assumption that nobody on the right cares about the environment; that\u2019s just obvious that\u2019s not true. There are people even in Evangelical churches today who are more environmentally aware, etc.\n\nYou obviously got a lot of pushback for your tweet about the hurricane.\n\n[Laughs.] Yeah!\n\nCan you help me understand what you were trying to say?\n\nListen, I had spent the weekend before in the Carolinas and in Georgia. I was in churches in Georgia and Carolina. I assure you they were praying that God turn that hurricane away. Are you telling me that all those people are stupid? Do you think those people don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s physics involved here? That those people don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s science involved here? The fact that you pray about something, that you visualize something, doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re less intelligent.\n\nDo you think the media was being condescending?\n\nOf course! As they have been \u2014 as some of them have been \u2014 about pretty much everything I\u2019ve said in this campaign.", "description": "The Democratic candidate also talks about the state of her campaign and that hurricane tweet. \u201cSometimes the political media elite talk about what the people think through the filter of what they think.\u201d", "authors": ["Olivia Nuzzi"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/23/23-marianne-williamson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
