This feels very much like candidate Obama\u2019s \u201ccling to guns and religion\u201d comment at a 2008 San Francisco fundraiser that became first an attack line used by Hillary Clinton, and then a well-worn conservative talking point that the would-be president was aloof and out of touch with small-town America. But more troubling than the rhetoric is where it leads. And for that, let me offer three suggestions to people with skill sets that I lack: one for pollsters, one for journalists, and one for policy analysts.\n\nFirst, pollsters should ask voters about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments and the issue of tax-exempt status, both now and in the exit polls for the 2020 presidential election. We can be certain this issue will be used in Republican political ads, especially in congressional districts that Obama won in 2012 but Trump won in 2016. And I suspect this issue and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s framing of it will lead to increased turnout of evangelicals in states that matter to Democrats, such as Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment may quickly fall out of the national news cycle, but it won\u2019t be forgotten among churches, religious organizations, and religious voters. And if the Democrats lose in 2020, this issue and their handling of it will likely be a contributing factor. That will be true regardless of who the eventual Republican or Democratic candidates are.\n\nSecond, journalists should ask O\u2019Rourke and every other Democratic candidate how this policy position would affect conservative black churches, mosques and other Islamic organizations, and orthodox Jewish communities, among others. It is difficult to understand how Democratic candidates can be \u201cfor\u201d these communities\u2014advocating tolerance along the way\u2014if they are actively lobbying to put them out of business.\n\nThird, policy analysts should assess the damage O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal would cause to the charitable sector. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s stance\u2014if played out to its end\u2014would decimate the charitable sector. It is certainly the case that massive amounts of government funding flow through religious charitable organizations in the form of grants and tax-exemptions. But anyone who thinks this is simply a pass through that can be redirected to government providers or newly established charitable networks that better conform to Democratic orthodoxies is na\u00efve to the realities of the charitable sector.\n\nDavid Pozen: The tax-code shift that\u2019s changing liberal activism\n\nDuring a 2015 summit at Georgetown University focused on caring for the poor, then-President Obama and the Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam showed a similar lack of understanding. Putnam asserted that \u201cmost organized religion has\u2026been entirely focused on issues of homosexuality and contraception and not at all focused on issues of poverty.\u201d Obama added that \u201cfighting poverty\u201d for Christians is often seen as just \u201cnice to have.\u201d As the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat observed at the time: \u201cIt would be too kind to call these comments wrong; they were ridiculous.\u201d", "description": "The candidate seems not to realize that eliminating tax exemptions for certain religious institutions would be catastrophic.", "authors": ["John Inazu", "Professor Of Law", "Religion At Washington University In St. Louis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2QJY8/facebook.jpg?1570830795", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
