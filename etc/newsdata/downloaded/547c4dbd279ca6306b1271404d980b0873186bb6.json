Pictured: Legionella bacteria\n\nState officials are encouraging anyone attended the fair last month and are experiencing symptoms to see a doctor.\n\nThe sickened patients range between ages 24 and 90 with a median age of 61, according to the DHHS.\n\nSeven cases of Pontiac Fever, a milder illness than Legionnaires' disease, but caused by the same bacteria, have also been identified.\n\nUnlike other illnesses, which are transmitted through person-to-person contact, those with Legionnaires' disease fall sick by inhaling small droplets of water with legionella bacteria.\n\nThe bacteria can multiply in places such as hot tubs, water tanks and large plumbing systems.\n\nSymptoms develop between two and 14 days after inhaling legionella bacteria. The disease typically begins with a headache, chills, high fever, and muscle pain.\n\nBecause the Mountain State Fair ran from September 6 to September 15, anyone sickened would likely have already developed symptoms.\n\nOn the second or third day, symptoms progress to coughing, chest pain, trouble breathing, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nBetween 10,000 and 18,000 Americans are infected each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMost people recover with antibiotics, but those with weakened immune systems or who have chronic lung diseases can form neurological complications that can be fatal.\n\nHowever, one in 10 people with the disease die,.\n\nThere has been an increase in Legionnaires' cases in recent years, by about 550 percent since 200, the CDC says.\n\nThe Asheville Citizen Times reports that this is due to a mix of greater awareness, an aging population and climate change.", "description": "An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease linked to the North Carolina Mountain State Fair last month has sickened 109 people and left one dead, health officials say.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/22/19227366-0-image-a-29_1570052446741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
