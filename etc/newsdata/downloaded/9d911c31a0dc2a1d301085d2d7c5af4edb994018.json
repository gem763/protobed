On this day, the lioness decided to try her luck.'\n\nDexter watched in horror as the scene erupted into violence.\n\n'The giraffe lashes out with a lethal kick as a lioness tackles her newborn calf,' added the 33-year-old photographer, who fell in love with the African Bush as a youngster before getting his dream job guiding at the world famous Malamala Game Reserve in South Africa.\n\nThe giraffe is distressed as she realises she's killed her newborn calf as the lioness circles her in the Maasai Mara in Kenya\n\nAs her calf lay dying, the distraught giraffe frantically tries to revive her baby before mournfully traipsing away, circling back to look at her lost child every few metres\n\nThe mother giraffe continues to pursue the lioness for a while but her attempts are futile as the predator lies some way off\n\n'Tragically her aim is slightly off and it is her baby's neck that receives the full force of the blow, rather than the lion's.\n\n'The mother giraffe continues to pursue the lion for a while but her attempts are futile. The lioness lies down a little way off, comfortable in the knowledge that she just has to wait it out.\n\n'The mother giraffe mills about for a while, apparently unsure of what to do next. Her baby is still alive but its neck is clearly broken. Eventually she starts moving off, stopping every 20 metres or so to turn and look back.\n\n'Once she was about 100 metres away the lion sauntered back onto the scene and minutes later the baby's short life had gone full circle in just one morning.'\n\nAlthough savage, Dexter believes that his impressive shots show the reality of life on the plains.\n\n'It was tough to watch, particularly the evident distress that the mother was in after her fatal error,' he admits.\n\n'But it's important to tell the full story. I think people appreciate it when they see my photos, they think the shots are great but the situation is tragic. Usually it's an \"Oh my God!\", hand-to-mouth reaction.\n\n'Nature isn't all cute and cuddly, behind every majestic portrait of a lion looking regal is a hefty body count.'", "description": "The brutal encounter shows a frantic mother wildly kicking out at the deadly lion but tragically striking her own child in the melee rather than the predator in the Maasai Mara in Kenya.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/12/20278154-0-image-a-9_1572265604000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
