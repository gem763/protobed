'They deserve the win but I'm not surprised about Arsenal.\n\n'I used to call them 'my babies' 10 years ago and I'm not being disrespectful. But that's the feeling I have with this team, when I played against Arsenal I knew I was going to win.'\n\nEvra, who won five Premier League titles during his time at Old Trafford, revealed a conversation he had with former Arsenal striker Robin van Persie when the Dutchman famously joined United from north London in 2012.\n\nThe Frenchman said that nothing has changed in their mentality since Arsene Wenger left\n\n'Even after one month (after joining) Robin Van Persie said \"you're completely right Patrice\". Even Guendouzi was in French second league, and he's the best player.\n\n'Nothing has changed \u2013 I'm like where is Arsene? Where is Wenger? Because it's the same.'\n\nEvra's damning assessment of Arsenal's character was echoed by regular Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher. The former Liverpool defender said that this latest defeat was unsurprising.\n\n'I feared for Arsenal tonight,' he said. 'Some of the football they (Sheffield United) played was outstanding.\n\n'Again we're talking about Arsenal on a Monday night, I've done this show for six years... nothing is different under Unai Emery. I actually thought Sheffield United would win the game before.'\n\nEvra said that former Arsenal striker Robin van Persie agreed with his sentiments on Arsenal\n\nArsenal boss Unai Emery has fielded criticism since arriving at the Emirates last season over his side's uninspiring form away from home.\n\nHis side's performances on the road last season in particular was a major concern among Arsenal fans following humiliating defeats away to Wolves, Leicester and Southampton.\n\nThe Gunners also capitulated away to lowly Watford at the start of the season having thrown away a two goal lead to leave Vicarage Road with just a point.\n\nMonday night's defeat means Arsenal sit just outside the top four on 15 points after nine games in the Premier League. They trail fourth-place Chelsea by two points.", "description": "Patrice Evra has laid into Arsenal following their dismal away defeat to Sheffield United.
