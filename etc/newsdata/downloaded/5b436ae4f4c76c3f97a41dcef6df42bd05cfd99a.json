We capsized, my wife and I, at least twice. My daughter capsized on a jet ski as well.\u201d\n\nJensen Burrows and d\u2019Sean Smith, who are both part of the GB Jet Ski Club, were able to rescue 100 people on Tuesday, according to the rescuers and Mr Pintard.\n\nThe pair were joined by dozens of others who also helped in their rescue efforts. The jet skiers ferried those they rescued to the Casuarina Bridge which was the nearest dry spot.\n\nMr Smith said: \u201cThe wind was pelting you, so it felt like rocks being pelted at you. I had his daughter and my friend, and the jet ski tipped over.\n\n\u201cJensen had the minister and his wife and Jensen also flipped over. He insisted we take the daughter and wife to safety first, so we did and came back for him.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
