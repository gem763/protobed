REUTERS/Gene Blevins\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom declared an emergency for both blazes, which erupted hours apart amid fierce winds this week that put emergency managers on high alert and prompted utilities to impose wide-scale power outages to curtail wildfire risks.\n\nNo injuries have been reported from either the Kincade fire in Sonoma County, about 80 miles (130 km) north of San Francisco, or the Tick fire in the Santa Clarita Valley about 40 miles (65 km) north of Los Angeles.\n\nBut the two blazes, the worst of several large wildfires across the state this week, have destroyed dozens of homes and other structures while prompting air-quality alerts in parts of Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nThe dry, hot desert winds, gusting to 70 miles per hour (112 kph), gave way to light breezes on Thursday night, slowing the fires\u2019 advance and presenting crews with a chance to make significant headway against the flames.\n\nThe lull was expected to be short-lived. Forecasts called for heavy winds to return late on Saturday and persist through the weekend, leaving fire crews a narrow window to tamp down the blazes in Los Angeles and Sonoma counties.\n\nPower companies, led by the state\u2019s largest investor-owned utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., also were bracing for a renewal of gale-force winds.\n\nEven as PG&E worked to restore electricity to nearly 200,000 homes and businesses switched off ahead of this week\u2019s earlier bout of severe winds, the utility announced plans for a new round of precautionary blackouts expected to leave 850,000 customers without power across 36 counties in northern and central California.\n\nThe utility cited weather data showing the expected windstorm \u201ccould be the most powerful in California in decades.\u201d\n\nAdding to PG&E\u2019s difficulties, the utility acknowledged on Thursday that the Kincade fire, which forced the evacuation of 2,000 people in Sonoma County after erupting on Wednesday night, began near the base of a damaged high-voltage transmission tower the utility owns.

Poor air quality from thick smoke drifting south prompted the Los Angeles School District to cancel classes for all students in the San Fernando Valley.\n\n\u201cScary, crazy. We\u2019ve lived here 37 years and never had to evacuate. So, you know, you always hear about it, you always think, maybe this time. But, yeah, this is the first time,\u201d evacuee Terri Egar said.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nThe fire has destroyed at least six structures, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said, adding that figure was expected to rise.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest evacuation that we\u2019ve had in Santa Clarita,\u201d Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger told a news conference.", "description": "California firefighters aided by subsiding winds took the offensive on Friday against two major wildfires at opposite ends of the state, one displacing 50,000 suburban Los Angeles residents and another roaring through Sonoma County's famed wine country.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444913837&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1EP", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
