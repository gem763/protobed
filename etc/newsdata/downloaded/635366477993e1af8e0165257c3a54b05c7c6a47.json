He was consistently the best in training.\n\n\u2018It was to the point where some of the best players in the world were standing there applauding what he was doing.\u2019\n\nHudson-Odoi eventually established himself in the Chelsea team towards the end of Sarri\u2019s spell in charge before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury against Burnley in April.\n\nThe England international has only just recovered from that setback and was handed a first Premier League start by Frank Lampard against Southampton in Sunday\u2019s 4-1 victory.\n\nHudson-Odoi, who recently signed a five-year contract at Chelsea, delivered a promising performance at St Mary\u2019s and assisted Tammy Abraham for the game\u2019s first goal.\n\nHudson-Odoi struggled for game time under Frank Lampard\u2019s predecessor Maurizio Sarri (Picture: Getty)\n\nGreen believes the sky is the limit for Hudson-Odoi, saying: \u2018He has got such a brilliant mind and he is so confident. When he goes out there he will try things and he will try it on the biggest stage.\n\n\u2018He will do something and you will ask him: \u2018When have you done that? Why did you do that?\u2019 \u2018He would say \u201cbecause I\u2019ve never done it before and I thought I\u2019d try it\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You knew from the way he spoke and the way he is around the lads, the way he holds himself and obviously his ability, he is going to be at Chelsea for as long as he wants to be and then, maybe, on to greater things.\u2019", "description": "Former Chelsea goalkeeper Rob Green has questioned Maurizio Sarri's use of Callum Hudson-Odoi last season by saying the teenager was consistently one of the club's best players in training.
