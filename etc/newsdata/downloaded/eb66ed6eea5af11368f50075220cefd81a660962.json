She just finished 10 intense days of chemotherapy and is very poorly.\n\n\"Sadly, Tanya's company sick pay was used up during the last time she had off work when she had her bike accident.\"\n\nAn Aldi spokesperson said: \u201cEveryone at Aldi is rallying around Tanya during this difficult time and we are arranging a number of fundraising activities to support her.\n\n\"We continue to wish Tanya well in her recovery and look forward to her returning to store as soon as she is well enough to do so.\u201d", "description": "Tanya said she is struggling financially as she is having to rely on statutory sick pay and her husband's earnings to pay the bills", "authors": ["Sophie Halle-Richards", "Image", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584592.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS195884645.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
