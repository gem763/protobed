The right-hander had made the hosts pay for errors along the way too, surviving a drop by Jofra Archer on 65 and Jack Leach claiming his wicket on 118 only for replays to show a front\u2011foot no-ball.\n\nWith Joe Denly falling late in the day to Pat Cummins via a fine catch by Matt Wade at short-leg, Rory Burns and Craig Overton, in as nightwatchman, will resume in the morning with England 23 for one. They need 275 more runs just to avoid the follow-on and know Australia will retain the Ashes if they lose here.\n\nSmith, who has 589 runs this series despite sitting out three innings with concussion, said: \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying to get a big score. I was disappointed to miss Headingley but I wasn\u2019t quite right and the right call was made. It gave me time to recover and I felt good. I was confident and have got us into a nice position.\u201d\n\nOn returning to the middle after the blow sustained from an Archer short ball at Lord\u2019s, Smith said: \u201cI faced a lot of short-pitched bowling and haven\u2019t had too many issues. The opposition bowling there means they can\u2019t hit my pad or nick me off. It softens up the ball too and that plays into my hands.\u201d\n\nWhen Smith brought up his third Ashes double-century after tea, tucking the 310th delivery he had faced round the corner off Stuart Broad for a couple of runs, England\u2019s weary cricketers could only applaud the batting on show and think back to missed opportunities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England\u2019s Joe Denly (right) walks off after being dismissed by Pat Cummins late in the day. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nArcher, who ended up with his career-worst first-class figures of none for 97 from 27 overs, had seen a tough return catch off Smith fly past his fingertips in the morning.\n\nBut the most galling came at the start of the wicketless afternoon session when Smith edged to Ben Stokes at slip only for replays to show Leach had overstepped. The spinner has sent down more than 15,000 deliveries in his first-class career \u2013 this was only the eighth no-ball along the way.\n\nEngland\u2019s inept afternoon conjures dark memories of 90s Ashes failings | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nSmith said: \u201cI had some luck, yeah. You always need some when you score big runs. It fell my way today. I was in a hurry for 20 minutes [after lunch] and after being caught off the no-ball I switched myself back on. When I saw the foot over the line I thought \u2018how good is this? I get to carry on batting.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo more chances slipped through English fingers \u2013 Jason Roy and the substitute Sam Curran gave Tim Paine lives on nine and 49 en route to a half\u2011century \u2013 while Jonny Bairstow let slip some frustration about the pitch.\n\nBairstow said: \u201cTo come here from Headingley, where it seamed a bit and did a bit in the first few days, and there be a lot less live grass on it was interesting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point talking about the wicket, that\u2019s gone now. We\u2019re playing on the pitch and we\u2019re into day three. No point complaining about that, we\u2019ve got a job to do these next three days. I\u2019m sure those conversations will be had later down the line.\u201d\n\nA troubling day was compounded by Stokes pulling up injured with a shoulder problem during his 11th over. England say it is too early to know whether he will bowl again in the match. The all-rounder, who returned after a spell off the field, clearly merits his place as a batsman alone but, if still hampered come the fifth Test, may force a selection change elsewhere.", "description": "Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss twice tore into the England team but watched on as Steve Smith dominated and the Australian then said: \u2018It\u2019s satisfying to get a big score\u2019", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df7ac46b1b678a88d7cf6b25a9ae42cfd07af1a/0_247_4206_2524/master/4206.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=060a13a22aaffe383b82bed204461d85", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
