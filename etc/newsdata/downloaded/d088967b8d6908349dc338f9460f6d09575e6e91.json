No coasting.\u201d\n\nThe book also reveals that Guardiola will impose a Christmas curfew on his players after a shock festive defeat to Crystal Palace last year threatened to derail City's title challenge.\n\nCity lost 3-2 to Palace at the Etihad on December 22 last year and were forced to play catch-up to title rivals Liverpool, eventually overhauling Jurgen Klopp's men to seal one third of an unprecedented domestic treble.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe book claims that days before that reverse, some players had stayed out after the club's Christmas Christmas bash and had turned up late at training the next day.\n\nSo this year, after consulting with his coaching staff, Guardiola will lay down the law on how late his players can stay out partying.\n\nPep\u2019s City: The Making of a Superteam, by Lu Martin and Pol Ballus, is published in paperback and ebook on October 24", "description": "City boss has said he won't stand in way if owners aren't happy with his work", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533616.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Manchester-City-v-Wolverhampton-Wanderers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
