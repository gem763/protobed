But his music remains grounded in his deep Kentucky roots, so much so that he can plausibly rhyme \u201crich\u201d with \u201ccatch,\u201d as he does on \u201cSend It On Down.\u201d\n\nCountry great Lee Ann Womack lends background vocals to that one, and Prine himself chimes in on the raucous closer, \u201cMexican Home\u201d - both signs of the respect Knight commands among Nashville songwriting royalty.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because Knight never seems inauthentic the way some more commercially successful country singers do. He just doesn\u2019t seem capable of being anyone but himself.\n\nIn his work, hope always bangs up against hard reality. Whether he\u2019s declaring his love for a woman with a \u201cheartbroke smile\u201d in \u201cCrooked Mile\u201d or complaining about media lies in \u201cThe Damn Truth,\u201d he\u2019s looking for salvation in all of it - and the search itself is often poignant.\n\n\u201cSometimes hope sinks like a stone,\u201d he sings on \u201cGo On.\u201d \u201dKeep your head up, keep your head up, keep your head up and go on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not happy music exactly. But it\u2019s the sort of striving that makes Knight, once again, an important voice for our times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chris Knight, \"Almost Daylight\" (Thirty Tigers)", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Scott Stroud"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/music_review_-_chris_knight_22852_c0-835-4009-3173_s1200x700.jpg?472b68e1e8048bb58ba3cb4bd6a0f64dd9e660c5", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
