What was it like working in the White House?\n\nGarten has already made it known she doesn\u2019t like to talk politics, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t share a few stories from her time working as a White House nuclear budget analyst under Presidents Nixon and Carter in the mid- to late-70s. Garten had previously described the experience as exciting but ultimately not fulfilling, which was part of the reason she ventured out to create her own path.\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting for the first few years because your work was going directly to the president. However, after four years, I realized that although I was working on projects that were $20 billion in size, nothing had happened in four years,\u201d she once said in a 2015 interview with IndieBound.com.\n\n2. What goes on at those celeb-inclusive dinner parties?\n\nGarten has hosted the likes of Taylor Swift, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Garner, and who knows who else at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. But other than \u201cthey cooked or something,\u201d there isn\u2019t much info on what they discuss, who they discuss, or if they ever get together to throw secret, celebrity-filled dinner parties. And it\u2019s already common knowledge that Garten loves throwing dinner parties \u2014 besides, she can\u2019t be preparing all this food just for her and Jeffrey.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nSpeaking of which\u2026\n\n3.
