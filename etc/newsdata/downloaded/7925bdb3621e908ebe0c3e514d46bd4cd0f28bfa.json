Who\u2019s the liar here? And more importantly, will we come down with an incurable case of buyer\u2019s remorse if we finally pull the trigger?\n\nOf the number of useless purchases I\u2019ve made in my lifetime (a Polaroid camera with a limited amount of disposable film, an expensive microphone in case I wanted to be an ASMR artist, to name a few), there are a few purchases I\u2019ve made that I am incredibly grateful for.\n\nI\u2019m happy I finally invested in a fantastic vacuum which cleans carpets as well as it does hardwood floors. I\u2019m excited about the heating pad I use for my back after a long day. And I\u2019m looking forward to using my Ninja blender later today because I can make pi\u00f1a coladas (with extra rum) in a snap.\n\nOn a Reddit thread from earlier in the year, u/baconlovebacon asked an important question about our buying history: \u201cWhat\u2019s the most \u2018worth it\u2019 purchase you\u2019ve ever made?\u201d The answers, ranging from the purely functional to the more emotional necessities, run the gambit:\n\n\u201cBlackout Blinds. Room is nice and cool in the summer and the darkness has lead to the best sleep I\u2019ve had in my life as well.\u201d - drayd38\n\n\u201cVacuum sealer for food. We get our meat from a friend who raises it and vacuum seal everything. We never have to throw any freezer burnt meat away. Best $70 we could have spent.\u201d - chungen91\n\n\u201cWhen I was going through a really nasty breakup, I bought myself a stuffed animal to cuddle at night (as all of the ones I had were from aforementioned ex-SO). It was deemed the \u2018self-love bear\u2019 and whenever I hated myself and felt worthless, I would hug that bear and cry into him until I felt better.\u201d - safdaces\n\n\u201cMy $25 toilet seat bidet. 15-minute installation and one of the cleanest arseholes in the PNW.\u201d - NaturalisticPhallacy\n\nEver bought something you\u2019ve never once regretted?
