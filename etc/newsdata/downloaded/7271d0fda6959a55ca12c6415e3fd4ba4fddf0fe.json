A Scottish appeal court ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful \u2013 but did not order MPs to return.\n\nThe government was forced to release its secret Operation Yellowhammer \u201cplanning assumptions\u201d for a no-deal Brexit, which warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain\u2019s streets.\n\nJohnson continued to insist \u201chuge progress\u201d was being made \u2013 although No 10 played down hopes of a breakthrough involving an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture which it thinks could help replace the backstop, and Michel Barnier said there were \u201cno grounds\u201d for formally re-opening talks.\n\nIncreasingly alarmed at the possibility that the PM might try to break the law by forcing a no deal, however, a cross-party group of MPs looked at bringing back a version of Theresa May\u2019s deal, plus a vote on a second referendum, in late October.\n\nAnd the outgoing Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, warned that he was prepared to rip up the parliamentary rulebook to stop any illegal attempt by the prime minister to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October.\n\nJohnson did, at least, meet the outgoing president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. It did not go well. Before heading to Luxembourg, the PM compared himself to the Incredible Hulk, throwing off the shackles of the EU.\n\nDespite EU officials repeatedly insisting they had seen no concrete British proposals whatsoever on alternatives to the backstop, the foreign secretary, Domic Raab, said the bloc had heard enough and was indulging in \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d.\n\nJohnson told Juncker the UK would not ask for a further Brexit extension and would not accept one if the EU offered it \u2013 nor would it request any extension to the EU transition period beyond December 2020 if he got a Brexit deal.\n\nUnfortunately, the PM was then humiliated by his Luxembourg counterpart, Xavier Bettel, who went ahead with a planned joint press conference that Johnson dodged because of protesters \u2013 and savaged Johnson\u2019s Brexit approach.\n\nAll eyes, meanwhile, are on 11 supreme court judges who this week will hear the politically charged claim that the PM acted unlawfully in advising the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks in order to stifle debate over the Brexit crisis.\n\nSome people worry that if the government wins, Johnson may even decide to suspend parliament for a second time when it returns on 14 October.\n\nWhat next\n\nWho knows? But four main scenarios seem to present themselves:\n\nUnlikely as it may seem, Johnson could still get a deal, probably based around a border in the Irish sea. He would find getting it through parliament very hard, but perhaps not impossible, helped maybe by Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies.\n\nHe could decide to break his promise, request an extension and then immediately demand an election, counting on a fiercely anti-EU, people-versus-parliament campaign to see him through.\n\nHe could, theoretically at least, go for no deal on 31 October, testing or even ignoring the law. Early elections would follow, with the PM trusting that with Brexit delivered, the Brexit party would be no more \u2013 and that no deal would not be too catastrophic.\n\nOr he could resign or be pushed out. Rather than the divisive Jeremy Corbyn, a more neutral figure (Ken Clarke?) might then head up a temporary government whose sole purpose would be to ask the EU for an extension, with elections to follow.\n\nBest of the rest\n\nTop comment\n\nIn the Guardian, Matthew d\u2019Ancona says Boris Johnson\u2019s invocation of the Incredible Hulk was apt \u2013 his behaviour is monstrous:\n\nDuring the leadership contest, Johnson said that the chances of no deal were a \u201cmillion to one against\u201d. Last month he said it was \u201ctouch and go\u201d. Now, in advance of his meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, he claims that \u201cwe will get there\u201d. Which Johnson to believe? Frankly, all this briefing about \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d and diplomatic \u201cmovement\u201d strikes me as mere preparatory work for the attribution of blame as 31 October approaches. Imagine Johnson and his acolytes raging as the deadline gets near, and how they will complain that the prime minister\u2019s superhuman efforts have been undermined \u2013 by Brussels, by remainiacs, by disloyal Tories, by judges, by Larry the cat. It will all be someone else\u2019s fault. That, at least, is what they will say. But don\u2019t believe a word of it. Inside the Hulk, there is and has always been a small and fearful man, wondering, with good reason, what will become of him when he loses all his strength.\n\nTop tweet\n\nA thread from a professor of EU law that is a wonder of clarity and concision:", "description": "PM said \u2018huge progress\u2019 was being made but the EU said there were no grounds for re-opening talks", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c29284b3d84373994803e76bdef530fbf83c845/0_48_1933_1159/master/1933.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d3c95ddd2059b7acc8da47691d0a7ae6", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
