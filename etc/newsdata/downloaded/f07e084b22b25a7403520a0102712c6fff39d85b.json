The workers are mostly women and non-binary people who speak in low voices and wear cool shoes. On the early summer day I visit their office, everyone is wearing black casual wear and staring intently at more than one computer monitor around a long, white conference table in the middle of the room. A couple of them huddle near a wooden bookshelf that has been artfully stacked with titles like Identifying Planetary Triggers; Sex Signs: Every Woman\u2019s Astrological and Psychological Guide to Love, Health, Men and More!; and Maslow\u2019s Toward a Psychology of Being that rest comfortably atop Marianne Williamson\u2019s A Return to Love.\n\nThe workers refer to these and other related tomes as they develop Co\u2014Star, one of the many new-ish astrology apps currently capitalizing on the renewed millennial interest in the ancient practice of reading the stars. The app asks users for detailed biographical information to develop an accurate natal chart, which is an \u201castronomical snapshot of the sky based on the exact day, time, and place you were born,\u201d according to the copy on the app\u2019s website. Co\u2014Star sets itself apart from its competitors by using \u201cdata from NASA\u201d and a proprietary algorithm that spits out unique, slightly robotic horoscopes for users each day, delivered in the form of push notifications. The style of the missives \u2014 direct, a little witchy, sometimes straight-up rude \u2014 has spawned countless memes and continues to drive users to the app almost two years after its founding. Since downloading Co\u2014Star earlier this year, I have received notifications like \u201cCheck your ego\u201d and \u201cDo you play well with others?\u201d and \u201cLook in the mirror and ask yourself \u2018who\u2019s the boss?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is the perfect app for the current moment: spare and stylish, more than occasionally nihilistic in tone, and made to be shared on social media. That it is about astrology is almost incidental, but has obviously contributed to its popularity. Because astrology, as you have probably heard, is trending.\n\n\u201cThe crux of feeling like a human is being able to talk about your reality\u201d\n\nIn the last five years, the practice has grown from a niche, New-Age pursuit to one of the main pillars of the millennial internet. What was once mainly a topic of discussion in female and queer spaces has permeated almost every corner of social media. Conversations about planetary transits and memes about what Virgos may be apt to do when presented with conflict are everywhere on Instagram and Twitter. (Co\u2014Star itself has over 800,000 followers on Instagram.) It has been easier to remember friends\u2019 birthdays over the last couple of years, because they will start posting on Instagram about \u201cTaurus season\u201d or \u201cPisces vibes\u201d in advance of their special days. Horoscopes are so popular that even David Brooks is talking about them.\n\nThe \u201cmystical services\u201d market, which includes astrology as well as services like aura reading and mediumship, is now a $2.2 billion industry. Naturally, these kinds of services are moving online, and several app developers have stepped in to monetize the trend. Sanctuary, which launched earlier this year, charges users $19.99 a month for \u201clive, on-demand personalized readings with professional astrologers.\u201d The Pattern, a \u201cpersonality\u201d app that uses natal charts to determine users\u2019, well, patterns, went viral in July after Channing Tatum posted an Instagram video accusing it of being too accurate. (The attention caused the app to briefly crash.) Co\u2014Star is free to download, but users can pay $2.99 to enter friends\u2019 or partners\u2019 birth information in the app. As of this summer, Co\u2014Star had over 5 million registered accounts.\n\nMany have attributed the current astrology frenzy to millennials\u2019 desire to talk about themselves at every turn. As Amanda Hess wrote at The New York Times last year, \u201cAstrology checks several boxes for viral-happy content: It provides an easy framework for endlessly personalized material, targets women, and accesses \u201990s nostalgia. It\u2019s the cosmic BuzzFeed quiz.\u201d\n\nBut according to Banu Guler, the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of Co\u2014Star, there is nothing silly about using astrology to explain yourself to your friends and followers. \u201cThe crux of feeling like a human is being able to talk about your reality,\u201d she tells me on the morning of my office visit, in between bites of an everything bagel with cream cheese. \u201cAnd I think the reason astrology has stuck around for 2,500 years is because it\u2019s remarkably good at that.\u201d\n\nGuler is wearing a black turtleneck, black paper-bag style pants, and she is carrying a Juul, which she uses occasionally. She has a gold septum ring, a perfectly pointy mauve manicure, and speaks with seriousness about her work. A former employee of the fashion startup VFiles, she launched Co\u2014Star in 2017 with co-founders Ben Weitzman and Anna Kopp partly because she wanted to focus her career on something more meaningful after President Trump was elected in 2016.\n\nAstrology, she argues, \u201cis a form of self care. I think it\u2019s also a way of, sort of, collective care. Right? Maybe \u2018collective self care\u2019 is the word \u2026 this idea of building relationships with each other and taking care of each other.\u201d\n\nWhatever kind of care astrology provides, VCs have determined that it is very valuable. In April, Co\u2014Star raised $5.2 million in seed funding to continue growing the app and develop an Android version of it. \u201cBy positioning human experience against a backdrop of a vast universe, Co-Star creates a shortcut to real talk in a sea of small talk: a way to talk about who we are and how we relate to each other,\u201d said the company in its funding announcement. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reduce complexity. It doesn\u2019t judge. It understands.\u201d\n\nCaring is not the first word that comes to mind when you open Co\u2014Star, which has a sparse, black-and-white design. The feel of the app makes it stand out from the cozy, millennial-pink aesthetic of so many other current startups \u2014 and that is on purpose, Guler says. \u201cWe live in this moment where all the startups can look the same, feel the same, kind of talk to people like they\u2019re toddlers,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything\u2019s cartoon and curvy edges. But that\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\nCo\u2014Star, Guler says, is not afraid to give users the unvarnished truth about their lives. How to communicate that is a work in progress, however. On the day I visit, Guler gathers her team in a small conference room to go over the brand book for the app, which is currently evolving. Over the course of an hour-long meeting, slightly bored content writers decide that words like \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cvibes\u201d are not Co\u2014Star, whereas \u201cego\u201d and \u201cattention\u201d are much better. McBean Parkway, who runs the app\u2019s social media accounts, describes the voice they channel on Instagram this way: Like a \u201ccool, older punk sister. You can smoke weed with us, but we\u2019ll read your letter to your crush.\u201d\n\nGuler says that the app\u2019s edgy tone is central to its success. \u201cYou can\u2019t grow without some negativity,\u201d she tells me. \u201cNegativity is the wrong word, because we\u2019re not just like, \u2018You\u2019re a dick.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe pauses for a moment. \u201cI think we have actually said that. But, if you\u2019re going to be self-reflexive and actually try to grow, you have to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to die, you\u2019re going to die. I could be a dick in these ways. You could be a dick in these ways.\u2019 But, if we start from there, and can just look at each other and be like, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re both humans,\u2019 through all of that? Something really beautiful can happen.\u201d\n\nSometimes not-so-beautiful things happen, too. It turns out people don\u2019t like it when you talk about death too much. Guler acknowledges that the three-person content team is constantly working on finding the appropriate language to use in their horoscopes, and that sometimes the jokes they make in the office aren\u2019t suitable for a wider audience.\n\n\u201cThere were some push notifications that were a little bit brutal\u2026 I think there were a handful about death,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd just kind of dragging people, which is actually how we kind of talk to each other: \u2018Eh, we\u2019re all going to die.\u2019 But they don\u2019t translate. I think especially given the context of, you get this push notification on your way to work and it\u2019s just like, \u2018We\u2019re all going to die one day.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo death is the line?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a line we run up against,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe content team is writing a textbook, not a blog,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo it\u2019s like there\u2019s one corpus that gets fed.\u201d\n\nThe carefully considered brand that Guler and her team are building is reaching enough millennials to make Silicon Valley take notice. The New York Times reported on Co\u2014Star\u2019s $5.2 million funding round when it happened and noted that VCs now see astrology as a way to reach female consumers. When I ask Guler her thoughts on this assessment, she somewhat rejects the question. \u201cI think gender is on the way out,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does mention two prominent women when I ask about careers she admires, though. \u201cI think that that\u2019s something that I think about a lot, because on the one hand, my reference points have been people like [fashion designer] Rei Kawakubo, who are effectively artists,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd on the other, people like [Glossier\u2019s] Emily Weiss who are just bad bitches building huge companies, doing sick work and having this incredible impact on the world. I\u2019m trying to find the halfway point between them that feels real and right.\u201d\n\nGuler is cagey about what exactly will come next in her personal career, however. \u201cThe future is unwritten,\u201d she says. \u201cWho knows what might happen?\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s a question for the algorithm.\n\nOh yes, the algorithm. How does that work, anyway? No one on the team will say exactly, but the process of creating the app\u2019s daily push notifications and horoscopes begins with lots of study. Ona Mirkinson, a lead content writer for the app, tells me that \u201cstudying astrology is a really big component to the production of content.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always studying astrology,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that means that we\u2019re reading multiple books about astrology and also looking at how people are currently talking about astrology on social media, on different blogs, just on the street or whatever \u2026 And I think also we use a lot of varied references, too. So that\u2019s one of the really fun things about working at Co\u2014Star is being able to merge astrology with psychology and literature to create these different snippets that then get mapped to people\u2019s natal chart.\u201d\n\nTo be clear: Mirkinson and the rest of the content team are not creating personalized horoscopes for every user from scratch every day. Instead, they write \u201csnippets that are mapped to various planets and houses and signs and combinations thereof, and they get assembled by the AI, and remixed by the AI,\u201d Guler explains.\n\n\u201cThe content team is writing a textbook, not a blog,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo it\u2019s like there\u2019s one corpus that gets fed.\u201d\n\nThis process is extremely different from that of, say, famed astrologer Susan Miller, who has been a favorite of the fashion set for years. (Miller is admittedly technologically challenged; she is often late posting her monthly horoscopes for each sign to her site, astrologyzone.com.)\n\nWhen I ask Guler about how Co\u2014Star compares to \u201cold-school\u201d horoscopes like Miller\u2019s, though, she stops me: Actually, she argues, the sun sign horoscopes Miller provides are a fairly recent tradition. A British astrologer named R.H. Naylor invented the sun sign horoscope \u2014 the kind you see in the back of a magazine \u2014 in the 1930s as a way to sell newspapers. Co\u2014Star, with its use of the entire natal chart, provides a more traditional reading of the stars.\n\nShe compared sun sign astrology to a scooped-out, diet bagel \u2014 all the good stuff gets taken out\n\n\u201cThe point of full natal chart astrology is that people are complex,\u201d she explains. \u201cMaybe your ego is structured like this, but you communicate this way. You love in this way. You take action in this other way. And you have this really robust language for talking about personality. For talking about what\u2019s happening to you, how you relate to others.\u201d\n\nWith sun sign astrology, astrologers ignore all that information in favor of traits that are associated with just your main sun sign. It is easier for both the astrologist and the reader to focus on just one element. But the Co\u2014Star algorithm can handle the details. To really get the full picture of your personality, Guler says, you have to consider your rising sign, your moon sign, and so on. She compared sun sign astrology to a scooped-out, diet bagel \u2014 all the good stuff gets taken out. Co\u2014Star provides a wealth of information about every aspect of your personality, pulling you deeper into the app each time.\n\nParadoxically, though, Guler says that people should spend less time on their phones and more time with each other. Before we met, I\u2019d read that she disabled most notifications on her phone as a rule. Wasn\u2019t Co\u2014Star just one more app for people to check? Guler says that the team does not actually expect users to open the app when they get a notification.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t open my Co\u2014Star notifications, and I feel good about that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, you get your message and you keep going with your day.\u201d", "description": "With it\u2019s cool and sometimes cold vibes, the app is feeding millennials\u2019 fascination with the zodiac through mystical algorithms and an old-school approach.
