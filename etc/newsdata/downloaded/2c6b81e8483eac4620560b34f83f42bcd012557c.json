But that's not cinema.\"\n\nGunn, one of the most prominent voices in the world of comic book movies given his work as a writer-director on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy series and producer on Avengers films and recent crossover into the DC Extended Universe with The Suicide Squad, took to Twitter Friday to voice his disappointment in Scorsese's comments.\n\nMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way. https://t.co/hzHp8x4Aj8 \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) October 4, 2019\n\n\"Martin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers,\" Gunn wrote. \"I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976) and Raging Bull (1980) filmmaker had well established himself as an auteur by the time 1988's The Last Temptation of Christ was set to hit theaters, Scorsese drew the ire of religious groups in the lead-up to that film's release for its portrayal of Jesus Christ (Willem Dafoe) and supposed deviations from biblical text.\n\nJoss Whedon, who has also worked across the party aisle as the director of Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron as well as writer/replacement director on DC\u2019s Justice League, responded to Scorsese\u2019s comments as well. \u201cI revere Marty, & I do see his point, but... Well there\u2019s a reason why \u2018I\u2019m always angry,\u2019\u201d Whedon wrote on Twitter, quoting one of his favorite Avengers.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d\n\n\n\nI first think of @JamesGunn, how his heart & guts are packed into GOTG.

Scorsese has lamented how difficult it was to convince a major movie studio to back his $160 million mob drama The Irishman, thus his decision to ultimately partner with streaming giant Netflix on the release. In the current landscape, distributors are far more willing to drop that kind of green on tried-and-true IP \u2014 like, ahem, superhero movies \u2014 than original adult dramas.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 28: Martin Scorsese attends the 57th New York Film Festival - On Cinema: Martin Scorsesee at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center on September 28, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Film at Lincoln Center) More\n\nAs Scorsese, who debuted The Irishman last week to raves and Oscar buzz at the New York Film Festival, explained to Empire: \"Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\"\n\nStill, Scorsese's comments are also surprising given their timing, and how close he came to a major credit on his own comic book movie.\n\nScorsese was at one point reportedly on board the new DCEU film Joker, which opened Thursday night, as a producer. Though he ultimately bowed out to work on The Irishman, Scorsese has been credited by director Todd Phillips for offering counsel and referring his longtime producer Emma Tilling. Phillips paid back the favors by including several Scorsese homages in Joker \u2014 which costars Scorsese staple Robert De Niro, with nods to Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy and Cape Fear.\n\nOf course, Scorsese was asked specifically about Marvel movies. Maybe he's just more of a DC fan.\n\nOriginal story updated with Joss Whedon\u2019s comments.\n\nRead more on Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
