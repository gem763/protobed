I\u2019m no europhile. Where I\u2019m from, in Newcastle, the politics of the European Union (often like our own Parliament) felt far away from the day-to-day struggles of my family and friends.\n\nAnd for a long time, we really have struggled. It is an understatement to say that Tory-led austerity has been hardest felt in the North East. Cuts to local services, a lack of investment in infrastructure and the constant undermining of hard-won rights for working people, exacerbate an already dire situation.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons for my involvement in the trade union movement. Not only has it changed my life, I truly believe that by working together, people can achieve more than on our own.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

I was motivated to join the biggest union in the UK by its outstanding regional presence, and by the work it has done defending my mam as a part-time teaching assistant who has suffered under the biting cuts of Tory austerity.\n\nKnowing that a Tory Brexit will harm the very communities our movement is meant to defend, I have been disappointed by many trade unions\u2019 ambivalence \u2013 or worse, facilitation \u2013 of this government\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nThe government\u2019s own reluctantly released assessment figures show that any deal will hit be another generation\u2019s worth of austerity. This puts a question mark over the business and investment that is only here because of single market membership, as well as increasing the burden on already struggling working families, to whom the Trussell Trust had to give out 27,000 food emergency packages in my area of Newcastle alone last year.\n\nIt\u2019s been difficult for an ever-decreasing number of trade unionists to square the circle of Leave communities being the places which will be hardest hit by Brexit. Thankfully, Unison has joined a growing list, including the GMB, TSSA, Community, Prospect and the Royal College of Midwives, which backs a public vote.\n\nIn my Leave-voting community, members of my own family felt enfranchised by the Vote Leave campaign, with it\u2019s direct promises of more investment and control over their lives. It is not only understandable, but entirely legitimate that people voted Leave on the promise of a better future.\n\nWe now know that the reality is quite the opposite.\n\nMy community were given false hope and lied too. They did not vote to be made poorer and see their already precarious working rights be revoked and degraded by a Tory government. But whether you voted to Remain or Leave, our 7-million-strong trade union movement needs to be standing up, not standing by for our members.\n\nJeremy Corbyn is currently the most powerful opposition leader in recent history. Trade unions, Labour MPs, members and voters are all uniting around a public vote \u2013 and he has a chance to deliver it.\n\nThis is not the Brexit that people voted for in good faith, and it\u2019s only fair and reasonable to put it back to the people. In every trade union in the country, once a deal is negotiated, it is put back to its members for confirmation. It is right to do the same thing on the most important issue of a generation.\n\nDave Prentis \u2013 general secretary of Unison \u2013 said it best: \u201cWhatever deal emerges in the coming days should be put to the country\u201d. He is entirely right, and I\u2019ve never been more proud to be a part of Unison.", "description": "I never thought I\u2019d become such a vocal campaigner for a final say. I\u2019m no europhile.
