Bakkt is an ICE-backed venture which aims to make trading and paying with cryptocurrencies viable for retail and institutional investors alike.\n\nThe futures are physically deliverable, meaning they pay out in bitcoin upon settlement. That's different to ICE competitor CME Group, which introduced its own futures contracts for the digital currency in 2017 which paid out in cash. Physical settlement is used for other markets like bonds, oil, cattle and metals.\n\nCryptocurrency fans will hope ICE's bitcoin futures, which are federally regulated, can provide some much-needed legitimacy to an asset class that has been mired in controversy following illicit activity in the still nascent industry.\n\nBitcoin is also known for its wild volatility \u2014 for example, a late 2017 bubble which saw prices rise close to $20,000 burst the following year. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been on the rise this year, with experts attributing the price jump to big firms like ICE and Facebook, with its planned libra cryptocurrency, getting involved in the space.", "description": "Cryptocurrency fans will hope the futures contracts, which are federally regulated, can provide some much-needed legitimacy to bitcoin.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106126609-1568307373243gettyimages-1158187859.jpeg?v=1568307405", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
