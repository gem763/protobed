In 2019, more proof of Limbaugh\u2019s assertion came on Monday via a tweet from none other than ESPN, who posted a \u201cBlack QB recap\u201d for Week 4, as part of their \u201cYear of the Black Quarterback\u201d feature.\n\nJameis Winston let it fly in a big win for the Bucs \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe Black QB recap for Week 4 starters \u2b07\ufe0f #YearoftheBlackQB pic.twitter.com/aVi3fWstZ0 \u2014 The Undefeated (@TheUndefeated) September 30, 2019\n\nThe graphic listed all the passing stats \u2013 excluding turnovers \u2013 of all black quarterbacks who got the start in Week 4. The caption highlighted Tampa Bay\u2019s Jameis Winston, who led the way in passing yards and touchdowns.\n\nThe irony of ESPN posting such a graphic given their history with Limbaugh was not lost on Outkick the Coverage\u2019s Clay Travis, who immediately took the network to task.\n\nI mean, what is @espn thinking with this entire racist story design? They fired Rush Limbaugh for arguing media was rooting for quarterbacks based on their race twenty years ago. https://t.co/6G6lkE6ff5 \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 30, 2019\n\nI look forward to the white quarterback report later today. Also, Patrick Mahomes only counts for half here. He should be on both lists. \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 30, 2019\n\nI am hereby declaring it the year of the white running back @espn. Black people had a good run, but we\u2019re taking over this position and ending racism. Check out this list. Boom. pic.twitter.com/dGVe0rK3tK \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 30, 2019\n\nIt would be hard to find a more clear example of the media rooting for a black quarterback to succeed. However, it\u2019s odd that ESPN would still have this graphic in 2019. When Limbaugh made his comments in 2003, there were only a handful of black quarterbacks in the NFL. As the ESPN graphic shows, nine black quarterbacks got the start on Sunday. A list which doesn\u2019t even include Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton who is injured, and Washington Redskins quarterback Dwayne Haskins, who came on in relief of Case Keenum.\n\nWith ten black quarterbacks seeing action on Sunday, it\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s no shortage of black quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\nIt\u2019s also noteworthy that, if you include Newton, three of the black quarterbacks in the league are #1 overall draft picks.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "As is the case with most things, it turns out Rush Limbaugh was right all along.", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages_Icon-Sportswire_Nick-Wisoka-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
