Mitt Romney, R-Utah \u2013 offering up some rare praise for Democrats while slamming his fellow Republican for his perceived disloyalty.\n\nThe president took to Twitter to tell Democrats that they are lucky to not \u201chave any Mitt Romney types\u201d in their party and adding that, despite supporting \u201creally bad policies,\u201d at least Democrats \u201cstick together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are lucky that they don\u2019t have any Mitt Romney types,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey may be lousy politicians, with really bad policies (Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities etc.), but they stick together!\u201d\n\nMITT ROMNEY BLASTS TRUMP'S 'BRAZEN' REQUEST FOR FOREIGN PROBES INTO BIDEN FAMILY\n\nWhile the president is known as a prolific Twitter user, Trump\u2019s most recent tweet about Romney continues what has been a very busy weekend on social media for him and comes just a day after he called the Utah lawmaker a \u201cpompous \u2018a--\u2019\u201d who \u201cchoked\u201d in his own runs for the White House.\n\n\u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u2018a--\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him),\u201d he said. He is so bad for R\u2019s!\u201d\n\nTrump was responding to recent criticism by the Utah senator over the president's comments in which he said that China should investigate Biden, just as he had urged Ukraine to do in July.\n\n\"China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened with China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" Trump said Thursday. \"I\u2019m sure that President Xi [Jinping] does not like being under that kind of scrutiny where billions of dollars is taken out of his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy.\"\n\nTRUMP CALLS FOR CHINA TO INVESTIGATE BIDEN FAMILY\n\nTrump had urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call this summer to \u201clook into\u201d the Biden family dealings in the country, particularly related to gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter served on the board.\n\nIn his China comments, Trump was referencing a 2013 trip to Beijing on Air Force Two in which Hunter tagged along. NBC News reported that Hunter Biden was attempting to start a big-money private equity fund. Chinese authorities issued the business license for the fund 10 days after the trip was over.\n\nRomney on Friday said that Trump\u2019s call for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens was \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\n\"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\" Romney tweeted.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHe added: \"By all appearances, the president\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\"\n\nTrump and Romney have feuded with regularity in recent years, with Trump regularly referring to Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat to President Barack Obama. Earlier this year, Romney penned an op-ed in which he attacked Trump\u2019s conduct and said, \u201che has not risen to the mantle of the office.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Adam Shaw contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Sunday continued his social media attack on Sen.
