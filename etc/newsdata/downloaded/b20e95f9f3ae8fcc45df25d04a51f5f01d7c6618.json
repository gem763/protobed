Announces Investigation Into Custody Battle Over Boy\u2019s Gender Transition", "language": "en", "text": "Texas governor Greg Abbott (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott announced Wednesday night that the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services are looking into a case involving a custody battle over a seven-year-old boy who is said to be transgender by his mother.\n\nFYI the matter of 7 year old James Younger is being looked into by the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. #JamesYounger \u2014 Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) October 23, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday, a Texas jury ruled against James\u2019s father, Jeff Younger, and awarded sole conservatorship to his mother, who has been encouraging James\u2019s \u201csocial transition\u201d against his father\u2019s wishes.\n\nJames\u2019s mother, Dr. Anne Georgulas, who is a pediatrician, separated from Younger several years ago after James and his brother were born, and was given exclusive rights and duties, while Younger\u2019s custody rights were limited.\n\nGeorgulas has said that seven-year-old James began to show signs of identifying as a girl when he asked for a girls\u2019 toy from McDonald\u2019s, began imitating the female characters from Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen,\u201d and started asking to wear dresses.\n\nAfter being referred to a LGBT family therapist, Georgulas was advised to begin \u201caffirming\u201d James by calling him \u201cLuna,\u201d as well as \u201csocially transitioning\u201d him at school. Medical records presented by the boy\u2019s pediatrician list James as \u201cLuna Younger, female,\u201d and included a recommendation to visit GENecis clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital Center, which offers \u201chormone therapy\u201d and \u201cpuberty suppression.\u201d\n\nGeorgulas\u2019 legal team has brought several therapists and counselors as witnesses, all of whom testified that James told them that he was a girl and wanted to be called \u201cLuna.\u201d\n\nYounger has contended in court that James is happy to present as a boy when they are together, referring to himself as \u201cJames\u201d and wearing male clothing.\n\nHe has also argued that the situation violates one of the two requirements for \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d in the DSM-V, the current manual used by the American Psychiatric Association. In addition to displaying characteristics related to gender expression, such as clothes, pronouns, etc., the patient must \u201cdisplay distress.\u201d Witnesses who testified in the case \u2014 including those who diagnosed James with gender dysphoria \u2014 said that he has not displayed any such distress, according to the Texan.\n\nConservatives, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, voiced their concerns about the case on Twitter ahead of Abbott\u2019s announcement.\n\nThis is horrifying & tragic. For a parent to subject such a young child to life-altering hormone blockers to medically transition their sex is nothing less than child abuse.https://t.co/sl8VcBgfTD via @nypost \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) October 24, 2019\n\nGeorgulas\u2019 legal representation told the Daily Caller in a statement Wednesday that a \u201ccompletely distorted and untrue version of events in this case has been circling the media . . . The pleadings in this case are available online, including, but not limited to, the Court\u2019s prior annulment proceedings and the numerous findings of fraud that the Court made in this case against Mr. Younger.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers said that Georgulas\u2019 case \u201cis being viciously attacked and threatened by complete strangers based on false and untrue statements.\u201d\n\nThe judge presiding over the case is expected to read the final ruling and order on Thursday, which may force Younger to call his son \u201cLuna,\u201d and attend classes on transgenderism. He could also be barred from taking his son outside the home dressed as a boy.", "description": "Conservatives, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, voiced their concerns about the case on Twitter ahead of Abbott's announcement.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Ilya Shapiro", "Kevin D.
