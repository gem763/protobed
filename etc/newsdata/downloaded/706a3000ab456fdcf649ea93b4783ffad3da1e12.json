Simon, Aphria\u2019s interim chief executive officer and chairman, in a statement.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Aphria recorded C$30.8 million (US423.5 million) in revenue, up from C$28.6 million (US$21.9 million) in the previous quarter. The company also reaffirmed its guidance for projected revenues for the year of between C$650 million (US$496.6 million) and C$700 million (US$534.8 million).
