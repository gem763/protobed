Nobody said that. I never felt that.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d made this record, and then we would go off and do whatever we wanted to do. And then Paul would call us and say, \u201cHey, you want to go in the studio lads?\u201d and we\u2019d do another one.\n\nRingo cleared things up Picture: Noam Galai/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018So it was not the end \u2013 because in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make. So I never felt it [the end of the band] was in stone.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in April 1970, the band split up, a month before their final album Let It Be was released.\n\nWhile Let It Be was The Beatles\u2019 last album, Abbey Road, which was released in September 1969, after John Lennon had privately quit the group, was the final album that Ringo, John, Paul McCartney and George Harrison worked on together.\n\nThe Beatles officially split in 1970 (Picture: Roger Viollet Collection/Getty Images)\n\nThe Beatles\u2019 11th studio album featured the songs Come Together, Something, Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer, Oh! Darling, Octopus\u2019s Garden. I Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy), Here Comes The Sun, Because, Her Majesty and a 16-minute medley of eight short songs.\n\nAbbey Road \u2013 the cover of which is the iconic image of The Beatles walking across a zebra crossing \u2013 sold four million copies in two months and is considered the band\u2019s greatest album by many critics.\n\nIt returned to the number one spot in the UK this month, 49 years and 252 days after it last sat atop the charts.\n\nReacting to the news, Paul McCartney said: \u2018It\u2019s hard to believe that Abbey Road still holds up after all these years.\n\n\u2018But then again it\u2019s a bloody cool album.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
