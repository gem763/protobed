USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a bipartisan Turkey sanctions bill Thursday that would go far beyond the economic penalties President Donald Trump has imposed \u2013 widening the rift between the two Republicans over Trump's controversial decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria.\n\n\u201cMr. President, as much as I like you and want to work with you, I am going to be consistent and I will hold you accountable,\" Graham said at a news conference unveiling the bill.\n\nHe spoke shortly before Vice President Mike Pence announced from Turkey that the two governments agreed to a five-day pause on military operations in Syria.\n\nIn exchange, Pence said, the Trump administration agreed not to impose additional sanctions on Turkey. And once there is a permanent ceasefire in place, the U.S. will lift sanctions that Trump imposed on Turkey Monday.\n\nGraham applauded the temporary ceasefire but warned it\u2019s just a first step in what needs to happen. He said he'll continue to seek support for his proposal in the Senate.\n\nThe legislation, which Graham introduced with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., would target Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s personal finances and sanction the Turkish armed forces, among other entities.\n\n\u201cThis measure gut punches Turkey,\u201d said Van Hollen.\n\nGraham said the sanctions are needed not just to fix the situation in Syria, but because China, Russian and Iran are also watching and need to be told they can't act with impunity.\n\nGraham has been one of Trump's most vocal defenders in other controversies, from the Russia investigation to the Ukraine impeachment probe. But on Syria, the South Carolina senator and ardent defense hawk has become Trump's chief antagonist.\n\nGraham was among the first to denounce Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which he and others said gave Turkey a green light to attack the Kurdish forces who helped the U.S. battle the Islamic State, also called ISIS. Graham called the move a \"stain on America's honor\" and said it was the \"biggest mistake\" of Trump's presidency.\n\nOn Wednesday, after Trump disparaged the Kurds as \"no angels\" and said the Turkey-Syria conflict was \"not our problem,\" Graham unleashed a new salvo at the president.\n\nTrump \"will have American blood on his hands if he abandons Kurds because ISIS will come back, and if any American is killed anywhere because a resurgent ISIS, it will fall on the Trump administration like it did (former President Barack) Obama,\" Graham said.\n\nAsked about Graham's comments, Trump fired back.\n\n\"Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next 1,000 years,\" Trump said during a White House news conference.\n\nSen.

On Wednesday, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. And on Thursday, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger blasted Trump after news reports that the U.S. military had to bomb some of its own facilities in Syria, so that enemy forces couldn't glean information from the abandoned American sites.\n\n\"Wow. We bombed our own base on purpose, because of the impulsive decision by @realDonaldTrump didn\u2019t leave time to evacuate the right way. Is this the America you grew up believing in?\" Kingzinger tweeted.\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday announced new U.S. sanctions targeting several the Turkish ministers of defense, interior and energy, as well as two of the country's agencies. Trump also said he would hike steel tariffs on Turkey to 50% from 25%.\n\nCritics in Congress say those penalties are a woefully inadequate response to Turkey's decision to invade Syria. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., derided Trump's sanctions as a \"wet noodle.\"\n\nThe Graham-Van Hollen sanctions bill mirrors one introduced last week by the chairman House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, and his GOP counterpart, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas.\n\nThe House measure would block U.S. arms sales to Turkey, ban top Turkish officials from entering the U.S. and impose sanctions on Turkish financial institutions that facilitate transactions for the country\u2019s military and defense industry.\n\nIt would also require the Trump administration to create a plan for helping the Kurdish communities in Syria in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\n\u201cWhat am I urging? Just listen to the commanders. Don\u2019t listen to Rand Paul. Don\u2019t listen to me. We\u2019ll go play golf and we\u2019ll talk about golf,\" Graham said Thursday before the cease fire was announced. \"If you don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, that I\u2019m a warmonger and want to stay forever, just write me off. All I\u2019m asking is that you do what President Obama did not do: Listen and adjust.\u201d\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe and Christal Hayes.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/17/lindsey-graham-trump-ally-introduces-turkey-sanctions-bill-senate/4007127002/", "description": "Graham has been one of President Trump's most vocal defenders in other controversies.
