There\u2019s just one area where traffic is likely to slow down, right after the barely-there town of Why and just before you hit the park.\n\nThere, a white canopy extends over the road with Border Patrol agents clustered underneath, away from the harsh desert sun. Cars are forced to slowdown at the checkpoint, answering questions by the agents. Dogs are there to sniff the cars for drugs and the agents\u2019 eyes scan backseats looking for stowaways.\n\nIt\u2019s a jarring interruption for visitors en route to 133,825 hectares of solitude, and one they\u2019ll be forced to go through all over again on their way back to Tucson at another checkpoint on the eastern edge of the Tohono O\u2019odam Nation.\n\nThe two checkpoints are part of a decade-plus effort to harden the border, slowly turning the southern fringe of the U.S. into a de facto militarised zone. But the various fences, checkpoints, surveillance apparatuses, and other tools to lock down the U.S. border haven\u2019t been enough for the Trump administration.\n\nRecent reports indicate the big real estate man in the White House wanted to install spikes on the fences, allow soldiers to shoot immigrants in the legs to slow them down, and build a moat stocked with alligators or snakes (Donald Trump has, of course, called these reports \u201cfake news\u201d).\n\nStreetView show Border Patrol stops just north of the national monument (left) and along Highway 86 near the Tohono O\u2019odham Reservation (right). (Screenshot: Google StreetView)\n\nWhile the suggestions read like white nationalist fanfic, here in what passes for reality nowadays, the administration is already hard at work militarising the border even further.\n\nIn late August, the Department of Homeland Security began prepping the site for construction of its new, 9 metre tall border fence in Organ Pipe, a move that is already damaging the fragile desert ecosystem and landscape that\u2019s sacred to the Tohomo O\u2019odham tribe that have lived in the area for centuries. The border wall going up in the park in many ways encapsulates the rotten core of the administration \u2014 from its flagrant disregard for the law to its willingness to trample the environment to outright cruelty, all in the service of the distilled racism at its heart.\n\nWhat makes the region so unique is that life has found a way to thrive even with precious little freshwater. One of the rare sources of aboveground freshwater sits within Organ Pipe\u2019s boundaries. Quitobaquito Springs is an actual oasis in the desert. Humans have flocked to its reed-ensconced shores for at least 16,000 years, according to the National Park Service.\n\nThe site is also home to the endangered Quitobaquito pupfish, a minnow-sized fish that inhabits the spring and a few other isolated stretches of water in Mexico. Beyond the pupfish, there are three other endangered species that call Organ Pipe home including the Sonoran pronghorn, lesser long-nosed bat, and the tiny Acu\u00f1a cactus. The park\u2019s boundaries also help protect habitat for dozens of other plants and animals in one of the harshest landscapes in North America.\n\n\u201cEcosystem connectivity is vital in the Sonoran Desert where wildlife need to be able to move freely to reach water, food, and mates,\u201d Louise Misztal, the executive director of the Sky Island Alliance, told Gizmodo in an email. \u201cWildlife do not see political borders and are always moving to find the things they need to thrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo really understand the borderlands in Arizona, you have to realise that most of it is public land or tribal land.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s currently 1,053km of wall interrupting some of the landscape connectivity between the U.S. and Mexico. But the Trump administration wants to rapidly build up fortifications along the nearly 3,219km border, with the president claiming hundreds of more miles of wall will be built by the end of 2020.\n\nTo do it, the U.S. president declared a national emergency earlier this year to circumvent funding mechanisms, allowing him to play a shell game with the American government\u2019s money. As part of that, the Pentagon announced last month it was moving $5 billion from military construction projects to border wall construction, upping the total Department of Defence contributions to wall construction to $9 billion.\n\nIt also allows the administration to fast track construction and environmental reviews. In an effort to create a totalitarian, locked down environment on the border, the administration has essentially turned it into lawless territory.\n\n\u201cTo really understand the borderlands in Arizona, you have to realise that most of it is public land or tribal land,\u201d Randy Serraglio, a conservation advocate with the Centre for Biological Diversity, told Gizmodo. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security is simply running roughshod over other federal agencies and Organ Pipe National Monument is a great example of that.\u201d\n\nThousands of scientists have denounced the wall for the long-term ecological harm it could cause. And what\u2019s happening at Organ Pipe offers a preview of that harm with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) waiving a number of environmental reviews to begin construction of a new barrier along 126km of the monument\u2019s border with Mexico.\n\nThere are currently vehicle barriers and what Kevin Dahl, Arizona\u2019s senior program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association described as a \u201cstrong law enforcement presence\u201d with both park rangers and Border Patrol agents staking out the border.\n\nOfficials have planned for the new sections of wall to be 5 or 9 metres in height depending on the location. In additions, the wall segments have been designed to include night lighting and a deep concrete footer to prop it up and prevent tunnelling. There\u2019s also what\u2019s called a \u201cRoosevelt Reservation\u201d along the border, a 18.29 metre wide strip of land on the the U.S. side the government owns. Dahl told Gizmodo he fears the DHS could basically scrape it clean, removing native vegetation.\n\nThe border wall near Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, pre-Trumpification.

All told, construction will require nearly 80 million gallons of water according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.\n\nIn the parched desert, water is in short supply and Dahl said NPCA is concerned that DHS could use groundwater or other sources that may be connected to Quitobaquito Springs, which sits just a few hundred feet from the new wall construction site.\n\n\u201cWe know the spring\u2019s output reduced when farmers in Mexico started pumping water,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we were operating under normal laws, scientists and other concerned people would be able to comment and suggest that the water be trucked in from nearby reliable sources like Lukeville or Ajo, which have plentiful water supplies.\u201d\n\nWhile DHS has said it will not drill water wells within five miles of the Quitobaquito, it\u2019s clear that the aquifer that feeds the spring extends well beyond that range. Tapping into the aquifer and even drawing it down a few feet could do long-term damage to the spring\u2019s water flow. In addition, he said the footer could also cut off groundwater movement.\n\nHow the whole aquifer and spring systems are connected is still an area of active research. That means wall construction could potentially disrupt it, permanently altering water flow in the spring and wiping out habitat for the endangered pupfish as well as a water source for other animals in the otherwise bone dry landscape.\n\n\u201cIf they pull out enough groundwater, they could essentially destroy Quitobaquito Springs in perpetuity,\u201d Serraglio said. \u201cThey could literally destroy it forever.\u201d\n\nConstruction could also partially or completely wipe out 22 archeological sites according to a National Park Service memo the Washington Post obtained last month.\n\nIn the report, the park\u2019s cultural resources specialist wrote that the Roosevelt Reservation is an \u201carea of great concern, whose cultural and natural resources are imperilled.\u201d\n\nIf construction gets completed, it will open up a whole other series of ecosystem-altering consequences. Misztal said the \u201cSky Islands are a continental crossroads.\u201d Bifurcating it with a wall would essentially bring migratory traffic to a standstill. Even species that fly could still face challenges with a 9.14 metre barrier.\n\nDahl said that bats, including the endangered lesser long-nosed bat, could be particularly impacted. The wall has slats that could mess with their ability to navigate. Add in the bright night lights and he said \u201cwe have no idea how that\u2019s going to disrupt this major migration of bats.\u201d\n\nAmong the only animals that could benefit are birds of prey. The wall will act as a perch to hunt from on high. And if the Roosevelt Reservation is scraped down to the dirt as Dahl worries, mice, lizards, and other small animals that rely on vegetation for cover will be easily picked off. In short, Dahl said the entire area could be \u201ca unique animal killing field.\u201d\n\nBut the administration\u2019s willful disregard for climate science is on display as well. The Southwest is facing an unprecedented risk of megadrought \u2014 that is a drought lasting a decade or more \u2014 due largely to climate change.\n\nChanging rainfall patterns and more intense heat in what\u2019s already the hottest part of the U.S. are increasing the odds of baking drought in place. Groundwater aquifers like the ones the administration are tapping to build the wall already take decades or longer to recharge as rain slowly seeps into the soil and percolates into the bedrock. With the odds rising for a long-lasting drought, drawing down already meager water resources is a surefire way to exacerbate the coming crisis.\n\nThe rain that does fall is expected to become more erratic. Heavy downpours are on the rise across the country, including the Southwest. With intense rain can come flash floods\u2014to take one example, a 2017 Arizona flash flood created what rescuers called a \u201c40-foot wide black wave\u201d (12 metre) \u2014 that endanger communities and alter the desert landscape. The current border fencing already traps water and has led to worsening erosion according to a NPCA blog post by Dahl, and the most fortress-like barrier being constructed will only increase the damage.\n\nThen there\u2019s what the wall is purportedly being put up to do: deter migrants and asylum seekers and staunch the flow of illegal drugs. There are ample signs the wall is an ineffective solution to deterring people or drugs. While it\u2019s true that large parts of Organ Pipe were shutdown from 2003 to 2014 following a ranger\u2019s death at the hands of suspected drug smugglers, Dahl said it\u2019s now \u201csafer than your bathtub.\u201d\n\nIndeed, most illicit drugs today come through regulated ports of entry, and previous border wall construction didn\u2019t reduce incoming migration, it only shifted where people crossed into the U.S.\n\nIn an era of increasing climate turmoil, Trump\u2019s border wall plan is a horrifying message to the world. Just last year, the Trump administration published the U.S. National Climate Assessment that synthesises the best available science on climate change.\n\nThe report warned that migration is a \u201cpotential national security issue.\u201d Numerous recent reports and studies back it up, and there\u2019s evidence current asylum seekers from Central America are in part being driven by climate disruption and attendant crop failures. All this as the U.S. is the biggest historical culprit when it comes to carbon pollution.\n\nTaken as a whole, it\u2019s not just national monuments and endangered species that are at-risk if border wall construction goes through at Organ Pipe. So too are equitable and just solutions to the biggest problem facing humanity today.", "description": "From Tucson to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, it\u2019s 200km of largely open road.
