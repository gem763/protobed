Now you tell me, how does a person take a p***? What do we say?\n\n\"White supremacy, that's how we feel. I was born in this country, my father served in this country, but it is white supremacy that is dividing everybody.\n\n\"I don't like being called a w**, I'm a human being. I went to school, I used to be called curry face. Is that a name? That's disgraceful, I don't like it.\n\n\"We have to abolish all this race hate, colour hate. Everyone here has the same amount of bones, the same amount of blood.\n\n\"You take my skin off and we are exactly the same. Where has racism come from?\"\n\nThe audience member says she has taught her son, who works in security, that he is a 'human being' and not a label.\n\nThe woman was applauded by the audience and all of the panelists at the end of her rant.\n\nTwitter users also backed the mum, sharing their similar experiences of abuse.\n\nOne person tweeted: \"She\u2019s right, stop the dehumanising of people and we\u2019ll begin to have more tolerance.\n\n\"We\u2019re all on the same journey through life. It\u2019s only the right wing beliefs of cultures that cause the trouble.\"\n\nChristopher Darby added: \"I saw this lady and was so moved.\n\n\"The p word she used, thankfully I have not heard that filthy word used since I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\"I am horrified it is still in use. Anyone uttering it should be arrested for hate crime.\"", "description": "WARNING - ABUSIVE LANGUAGE: The audience member said her son continues to be called racist names, years after she was called 'curry face' at school", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645059.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-000943.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
