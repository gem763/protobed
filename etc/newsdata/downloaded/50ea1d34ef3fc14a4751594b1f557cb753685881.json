It is the first congressional testimony by a Boeing official since the first of two Max crashes that together killed 346 people.\n\nIndonesia investigators say Boeing\u2019s design of a key flight-control system contributed to the crash of a Lion Air Max last October. Another Max crashed in Ethiopia in March, and other Max jets were grounded.\n\n\u201cBoth of these accidents were entirely preventable,\u201d said Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss.\n\nIn his prepared remarks , Muilenburg said the company knows it made mistakes and got some things wrong. He vowed to make the plane safe.\n\nBoeing is fixing flight-control software and hopes to win Federal Aviation Administration approval by year end to return the plane to flight. The FAA is also coming under scrutiny for relying on Boeing employees to perform some certification tests and inspections. It\u2019s an approach FAA has followed for many years.\n\n\u201cWe need to know if Boeing and the FAA rushed to certify the Max,\u201d Wicker said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's been exactly one year since a Boeing 737 Max crashed in Indonesia, and the company's CEO is likely to face tough questioning about the plane from a Senate committee.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/boeing_ceo_congress_39726_c0-478-5734-3822_s1200x700.jpg?d881b5dbe31ad319e6fef36c6675e6ddb3e90565", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
