She died in 2014.\n\nThey had five children and thirteen grand-children between them.", "description": "Louis Belcourt from Hythe, Kent slipped and broke his arms while on holiday on the Indian Ocean island", "authors": ["Stela Gineva", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Kentlive", "Ws", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20746870.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Dad-of-five-died-after-breaking-both-his-arms-in-a-fall-on-holiday-in-MauritiusEx-Hythe-town-counci.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
