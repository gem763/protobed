That\u2019s according to analysts, who are flagging the senator\u2019s rising influence ahead of bank earnings reports, which kick off next week, and noting that the possibility of impeaching President Trump has pulled forward some risk.\n\nBank earnings season starts on Tuesday, Oct. 15, with reports from Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.; those stocks were mixed in mid-day trading on Monday, with Citigroup, JPMorgan and Goldman each gaining less that 0.5% and Wells Fargo falling 0.3%.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of the latest commentary:\n\nCowen, Jaret Seiberg\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren will be the overhang this earnings season,\u201d Seiberg wrote in a note. Even if she fails to secure the nomination, she \u201cwill control financial policy in any Democratic administration,\u201d which is \u201cnegative for big banks, private equity, payday lenders, debt collectors and servicers.\u201d\n\nJust how much the senator\u2019s policies will hurt the financial services sector depends not only on whether a Democrat wins the White House, but also on which party controls the Senate, he said. \u201cIf the GOP keeps the Senate -- which is likely -- then there will be sharp limits on what she can achieve.\u201d\n\nRBC, Lori Calvasina\n\nThe possibility of a Trump impeachment has pulled some risk into the current quarter, Calvasina wrote in a note. She sees further potential headwinds for the stock market in the first half of next year, particularly the first quarter, as about two-thirds of Democratic party delegates will be assigned by early March.\n\nA Warren win, along with Democrats taking complete control of Congress, would be \u201cextremely challenging for stocks,\u201d Calvasina said, with the \u201csheer multitude\u201d of Warren policy plans leaving \u201cU.S. equity investors with few safe havens.\u201d\n\nInvestors polled by RBC have highlighted health care as the primary sector at risk in a Democratic sweep. But the firm\u2019s own analysis -- including a survey of RBC industry analysts in early October, plus a review of which sectors have gained the most from lower corporate taxes and share buybacks -- indicated there\u2019s also \u201cextremely high risk\u201d for energy and financials, and a \u201csignificant degree\u201d of risk for industrial firms and tech. Implications for consumer discretionary, communication services, materials and consumer staples are mixed, while utilities and REITs face the fewest risks.\n\nCapital Alpha, Ian Katz\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Warren is uniquely troubling to the finance industry,\u201d Katz wrote, as she \u201cfeels comfortable with the subject matter.\u201d\n\nWarren has taken on banks and private equity firms, and she may be the Senate Banking Committee\u2019s most active member, \u201cfiring off letters to regulators on topics that are way off the radar screen for most of her colleagues,\u201d he said. She was also chairwoman of a Congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, and frequently challenged the Obama administration as well. Her specialty in academia was bankruptcy law, \u201cwhich helps explain her intense interest in private equity,\u201d Katz added.\n\n\u201cThe finance industry recognizes that Warren, more than any other Democratic candidate, knows how to connect with the public and make weedy proposals resonate with ordinary Americans,\u201d Katz said.\n\nHeight Capital Markets, Benjamin Salisbury\n\n\u201cThe fall brought football and a flood of client questions about what Senator Elizabeth Warren would be like as president,\u201d Salisbury wrote.\n\nNow comes \u201ca crucial period for winnowing the field of contenders with two debates and a fundraising report,\u201d he said. Height is emphasizing the \u201cimportance for investors of monitoring which candidates survive the winnowing into the Second Tier as historically, half the Democratic nominees have come from fourth place or worse at this stage in the campaign.\u201d\n\n(Adds commentary from Capital Alpha and updates share trading in 2nd paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Cristin Flanagan.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Divya Balji\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Though there\u2019s more than a year to go before the November 2020 presidential election, the stock market has already started to reflect the ramifications of Elizabeth Warren potentially capturing the White House.
