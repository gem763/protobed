But now, one heavy vehicle brand might be ready to deliver a breakthrough.\n\nScania trucks, which is Swedish but owned by Volkswagen, has revealed its new AXL tipper truck. And it looks like nothing you\u2019ve seen before.\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nThe design is a dramatic departure from everything you\u2019d associate with heavy transport. Scania has envisioned a driverless truck which has no capacity for occupants. Instead of the traditional truck cab superstructure, this Scania AXL features a sleeker appearance.\n\nAlthough there is some semblance of a traditional grille, to channel airflow to the large turbodiesel engine, and LED lights to illuminate the road, farm or work yard, this Scania looks like something from 2040.\n\nTesting autonomous vehicles where it is safest\n\nScania realised that some of its customers have complete control over their road infrastructure. Mining companies, construction crews, and quarries contain mostly sealed routes, where there is a lot less risk for traffic or pedestrian contingencies.\n\nProgramming an autonomous truck to function in this environment, is achievable with current technology. Unlike the challenge that traditional automakers are facing, by making cars anticipate every single possible issue in dense traffic or misbehaviour by pedestrians.\n\nThe Scania AXL gathers data about its driving environment from seven cameras, a laser, and radars. Without any human intervention possible, the AXL is a brave concept and Scania\u2019s engineers have set substantially robust redundancy parameters for it, to avoid the truck possibly going \u2018rogue\u2019.\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nThere are enormous benefits from not having to integrate a cab with the AXL\u2019s design. It has a lower centre of gravity, for improved stability, and a far superior aerodynamic profile \u2013 which should compound to a noticeable fuel consumption saving.\n\nEnhancing the AXL\u2019s sustainability profile is a biodiesel compatible engine but the truck can visualise and understand its revolutionary environment.\n\nMaking a weatherproof autonomous vehicle\n\nThe AXL\u2019s sensory systems are overbuilt, to ensure that if one camera or sensor fails, there is another part of the system which can easily execute its functions. This is a very important issue as autonomous driving engineers have discovered that small issues can disable a system: such as mud over a camera lens or overnight frost icing over a sensor.\n\nAlthough Scania has admitted that the AXL is not yet street-smart, it will enable the company to gather vital data about how an autonomous driving vehicle operates in real-world conditions, albeit at very slow speeds.\n\nIn a world where many brands have promised to enable self-driving technologies, and not yet delivered, the simple truth is that any fully autonomous breakthrough will be piloted by the heavy transport industry \u2013 instead of a passenger vehicle brand.", "description": "Swedish truck brand is doing what most premium car brands can\u2019t: building a true autonomous vehicle, writes  Lance Branquinho", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9421/01140995d130466cad45ce7ebf1c4e4d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
