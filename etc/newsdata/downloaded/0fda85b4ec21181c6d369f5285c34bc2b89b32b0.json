They just haven't known how many species were lurking there.\n\nScientists long thought the electric eels found in swamps, streams, creeks and rivers across South America were all the same species. The new study shows that the eels actually belong to three different species.\n\nAll three species look pretty much the same externally and use their electricity to navigate, communicate, hunt and for self-defense. But when scientists analyzed 107 samples, they found that the three species had different genetic material, unique skull shapes, and different levels of voltage.\n\nBased on their research, de Santana and his team believe that the three species began to evolve from their common ancestor about 7.1 million years ago.\n\nThe eels' voltage may have been influenced by the conductivity of the waters they lived in, the research found. Electrophorus voltai, for instance, lived in the clear waters of the highlands which did not conduct electricity well. According to de Santana, the species' stronger voltage may be an adaption to the poor conductivity of the water.\n\nThere are about 250 species of fish that are able to generate electricity, but electric eels are the only ones that use electricity to hunt and for self-defense.\n\nIn 1799, scientists used electric eels as the inspiration behind the first battery design, and have also inspired ideas about how to improve technology and treat disease.\n\nThe newly discovered electric eel species could have evolved unique systems to produce electricity -- perhaps a different system than the first discovered species -- which could lead to more discoveries, de Santana said.\n\n\"It could really have different enzymes, different compounds that could be used in medicine or could inspire new technology,\" he said.", "description": "A newly-identified eel living in the Amazon basin can deliver record-breaking electric jolts, according to a study published Tuesday.", "authors": ["Julia Hollingsworth"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911104144-a-picture-of-electrophorus-voltai-one-of-the-two-newly-discovered-electric-eel-species--super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
