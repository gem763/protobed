The town was created in the 1880s as a fill-station for a railroad, but died off when Interstate 70 was built a few miles north.\n\nMuza first became fascinated by the town when she visited it while on vacation. She purchased it in 2015 and left her life in Chicago to move there.\n\nShe is fixing up the buildings to honor the town\u2019s history and so other artists can work from them in a residency project she calls: \u201cHome of the Brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe arts are one of the few things that redeem us as human beings,\u201d Muza said.\n\nHer longtime friend, Lauren Calhoun, recently came to visit and help rebuild the buildings that are falling apart. She laughed when she first heard about Muza\u2019s plan to live there, but said it makes sense for Muza.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had this really romantic idea of these objects that have this history, and she\u2019s just surrounded by that here,\u201d Calhoun said.\n\nMuza is still getting used to living without normal amenities, such as running water, but says she loves the solitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a separate space away from your life that you can sort of change the way you think and be in a different environment,\u201d Muza said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An artist is trying to revitalize an abandoned old railroad town in eastern Utah by refurbishing dilapidated buildings and converting them into residences for artists.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
