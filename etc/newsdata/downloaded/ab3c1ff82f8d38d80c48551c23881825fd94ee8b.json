Nothing in our modern society can function without access to power, and it\u2019s the utility industry that provides that to everybody, which is why this is an urgent matter of national concern,\u201d Chertoff, who served under former President George W. Bush, said.\n\nThe majority of those surveyed, around 54 percent, reported that they expect a cyberattack on critical infrastructure within the next year, and 64 percent described cyberattacks as a \u201ctop challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere past attacks primarily targeted data theft, current and future attacks can hijack control systems and logic controllers that operate critical infrastructure with the intent to cause physical damage and outages,\u201d Siemens and Ponemon wrote.\n\nThe cyberattacks have already taken their toll on utility groups, with 25 percent of those surveyed reporting being the subject of \u201cmega attacks\u201d potentially engineered by \"nation-state\" actors. These more advanced attacks make managing the security of the OT involved in utilities more difficult, with 64 percent of respondents citing concerns around the increasingly sophisticated attacks.\n\n\u201cBecause many utilities manage infrastructure critical to daily life, nation-states and other malicious actors have an interest in developing cyber weapons that target utilities,\u201d the groups wrote. \u201cIndividuals and criminal organizations may now also have the backing of nation-states, or state-aligned proxy groups, interested in damaging physical assets, and may use potent cyber warfare tools originally developed by nation-states.\u201d\n\nWhile the report did not mention any nation-states by name, the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment compiled by former Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats found that both China and Russia have \u201cthe ability to execute cyber attacks in the United States that generate localized, temporary disruptive effects on critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\nChertoff also pointed to China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and Venezuela as all having the capability of carrying out cyberattacks or \u201cmischief\u201d on the U.S.\n\nThe survey findings were released one week after the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found in a separate report that the Department of Energy (DOE) is not doing enough to protect the electric grid from cyberattacks, with the most vulnerable portion of the grid the industrial control systems that support operations.\n\nGAO criticized DOE for not having developed plans to secure the electric grid against cyberattacks that would lead to a national strategy. Karen Evans, the assistant secretary of DOE\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, stated that she \u201cconcurs\u201d with GAO\u2019s recommendation on the creation of a federal cybersecurity strategy, and that DOE\u2019s current cyber actions \u201cmeet the intent of GAO\u2019s recommendation.\u201d\n\nDespite the negative findings of the report, Siemens and Ponemon described the threat to utilities posed by cyberattacks as \u201cmajor but manageable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttackers and defenders will continue to innovate, and the systems used by utilities under normal operations will continue to advance,\u201d the groups wrote. \u201cA sophisticated business that uses digital technologies to operate more efficiently than competitors needs to protect those technologies from attacks.\u201d", "description": "A new study published Friday\u00a0finds that cyberattacks on the operational technology (OT) involved in running critical utilities are increasing and says these\u00a0attacks have the potential to cause \u201csevere\u201d damage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/electricgrid_thinkstock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
