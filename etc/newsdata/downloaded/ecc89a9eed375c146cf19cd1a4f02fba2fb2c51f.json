The college canceled a course on dissent and resistance in Singapore after deeming it too provocative. (Joyce Fang/AP)\n\nWhen Yale University opened its first new college in 300 years, a joint venture with the National University of Singapore, the Ivy League institution acknowledged that operating in the politically restrictive city-state would mean accepting constraints on civic freedoms. But Yale judged it worth the cost to develop a liberal arts curriculum in Asia.\n\nFrom the time it welcomed its first class in 2013, the Yale-NUS college did not allow partisan political groups on campus. It had to abide by local laws that prohibit protests except within a designated area of one city park known as the speakers\u2019 corner. Even then, permits are required.\n\nSo critics were not surprised when the university deemed a one-week-long course on \u201cDialogue and Dissent in Singapore\u201d too provocative and canceled it this month. Although only 16 students were enrolled, the decision has revived a debate on whether American liberal colleges and other Western universities are compromising their values of academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas when they expand into places with restrictive political climates such as Singapore, the Persian Gulf states and China.\n\nMost U.S. universities that pursue such growth \u201crecognize that their assumptions about academic freedom will need to be adjusted,\u201d said Kris Olds, an expert on the globalization of public education, at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. \u201cHow far will they bend, though?\u201d\n\n[A student in Boston wrote \u2018I am from Hong Kong.\u2019 An onslaught of Chinese anger followed]\n\nIn Singapore, the episode has also laid bare a fear among officials that Hong Kong-style protests could someday erupt on their similarly skyscraper-filled, land-scarce shores \u2014 an unlikely prospect, experts say, and not one the program was advocating.\n\nThe Yale-NUS program was among 14 off-campus learning experiences from which students had to pick one as part of their curriculum. It was to feature a lineup of Singaporean activists discussing what it means to be a dissident in the local context. Students were to visit the park where rallies are allowed, hold discussions with activists and design protest banners.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways to get these insights is to meet some so-called dissidents face to face,\u201d wrote Alfian Sa\u2019at, a Singaporean playwright who helped design the program, in a Facebook post.\n\nThe project was canceled because it \u201cdid not adequately cover the range of perspectives required for a proper academic examination of the political, social and ethical issues that surround dissent\u201d and risked \u201cbreaking the law and incurring legal liabilities,\u201d Yale-NUS president Tan Tai Yong told The Washington Post.\n\n\n\nYale-NUS president Tan Tai Yong said the program risked \u201cbreaking the law.\u201d (Joyce Fang/AP)\n\nThe proposed program included a screening of \u201cJoshua Wong: Teenager vs. Superpower,\u201d a 2017 documentary on the Hong Kong democracy activist who rose to prominence in 2014 street protests against China\u2019s refusal to grant the semiautonomous territory universal suffrage.\n\nTan Chuan-Jin, the speaker of Singapore\u2019s parliament, criticized the planned course and quickly made the link to the protests that have roiled Hong Kong in recent months: \u201cGiven what is happening in Hong Kong and elsewhere, do we believe that this is the way to go? Is this the liberal education that we need to get us into the future?\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s pro-government press published an op-ed in the main Chinese and English language broadsheets that went further, warning that Singapore does not need a \u201ccolor revolution.\u201d The piece, written by a former lawmaker, parroted Chinese state media descriptions of the Hong Kong unrest, including charges that foreign forces are funding the demonstrators.\n\n[Jackson Diehl: Yale, NYU sacrifice academic freedom]\n\nKirsten Han, a journalist and activist who was to lead a class about democracy as part of the program, expressed disappointment over its cancellation, acknowledging that Yale-NUS was always seen as a freer space compared with other Singaporean universities.\n\n\u201cIt was problematic from the beginning and it was always going to be really hard for them to navigate, given Singapore is not a place you can teach liberal arts openly,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut it was still a safer space, and the students are still incredibly enthusiastic.\u201d\n\nThe program\u2019s cancellation sparked consternation at Yale in the United States. Peter Salovey, the university\u2019s president, said in a statement this month that he had conveyed his \u201cconcern\u201d to Tan, the Yale-NUS chief, and would review the process behind the decision before determining \u201cthe appropriate response.\u201d\n\nThe issue about exposing students to legal liabilities and operating within Singapore laws also points to one of the major criticisms of @yalenus from the beginning: that it\u2019s a liberal arts college in an authoritarian country where civil liberties is not respected. \u2014 Kirsten Han \u97e9\u4fd0\u9896 (@kixes) September 14, 2019\n\nBut some Yale alumni and academics say such concern underscores naivete on the part of Yale\u2019s then-leadership in believing the university\u2018s cherished reputation for rigorous academic debate and openness could be upheld when it set up shop in Singapore.\n\n\u201cFor some 40 years, the [Singapore] government has made sure universities never become a seedbed for dissent and don\u2019t normalize political contention. There was never a chance that Yale-NUS would be exempted from this taboo,\u201d said Cherian George, associate dean at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s School of Communications.\n\nGeorge, a Singaporean academic, was effectively pushed out of a university in his home country, a decision seen as punishment for his critical writings.\n\nSome students at Yale-NUS have pressed college administrators for an explanation. Averyn Thng, a third-year anthropology student, was among 30 students who met with Tan Tai Yong and the college\u2019s executive vice president after the class was canceled.\n\n\u201cWe were very clearly told that academic freedom is something that has to be managed, and framed in a way that doesn\u2019t allow for partisanship,\u201d Thng said in an interview. \u201cBut at the end of the day, what is considered partisanship is in the eyes of those who have power.\u201d\n\nLinda Lim, a Singaporean professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and a Yale graduate, said the college\u2019s decision was tantamount to censorship. Yale-NUS, she said, argued at its inception that the \u201cbedrock value\u201d of academic freedom would not be compromised but rather bolstered by the college\u2019s presence in the city-state.\n\nYet, \u201cinstead of Singapore becoming more like Yale in terms of academic freedom, it looks like Yale is becoming more like Singapore,\u201d Lim said.\n\nRead more\n\nA student in Boston wrote \u2018I am from Hong Kong.\u2019 An onslaught of Chinese anger followed.\n\nJackson Diehl: Yale, NYU sacrifice academic freedom\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "As U.S. universities expand abroad, core principles can collide with restrictive political climates.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CKjDlHrIF41brEMvLKcXdGMJ0OY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4CJUI2HANUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
