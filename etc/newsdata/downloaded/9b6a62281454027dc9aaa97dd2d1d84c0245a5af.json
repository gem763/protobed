Sign up here.\n\nTwo American consumer electronics companies said this week that they\u2019re looking to shift manufacturing away from China and into other countries, citing pressures from import tariffs on their products amid the trade war.\n\nFitbit Inc. said on Wednesday that it would stop Chinese manufacturing of its health trackers and smartwatches by January. Tile Inc. said it\u2019s also considering plans to make its Bluetooth-enabled location trackers in other countries, after the company was hit with tariffs last month.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for a company like Tile is our ability to plan for shifting changes in U.S. policy toward China,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer CJ Prober. \u201cWith recent impacts, we are looking at other regions.\u201d\n\nTile on Tuesday added a new sticker to its lineup of tracking devices that help customers keep tabs on keys, wallets and the like, and raised $45 million in funding in its last round of funding earlier this year. The gadget maker does the majority of its manufacturing in China, but as the U.S.-China trade war has escalated, it\u2019s now considering Mexico, Malaysia, Vietnam and \u201cpossibly the U.S.\u201d as future manufacturing hubs, Prober said.\n\n\u201cWe are re-evaluating our entire supply chain and how we do what and where,\u201d he said, adding that in recent weeks, Tile had dedicated an \u201centire team\u201d to the task of traveling to different cities and evaluating manufacturing facilities. In a sign of concern from investors about the potential costs of relocating these operations, shares of San Francisco-based Fitbit fell as much as 2% Wednesday after announcing the move from China.\n\nSeveral U.S. companies, long accustomed to using China as a manufacturing base, are now looking to reduce their exposure to the country. Last year, GoPro Inc. announced it would move much of its U.S.-bound camera production out of China to avoid potential tariffs, and has largely accomplished that goal, according to a spokesman. In August, HP Inc.\u2019s laptop maker Inventec Corp. said it will shift production of notebooks for the U.S. market away from China. Apple Inc. has been doing battle with the White House over requests to get the iPhone and other products off the list of Chinese-made goods slated to be hit with tariffs on Dec. 15.\n\nThe latest $300 billion round of duties will impact essentially all remaining Chinese imports\u2014with some exceptions, though details around which imports will be exempted are still unclear. Trade policy between the world\u2019s two largest economies is still in flux. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is set to visit the U.S. this week for further trade talks.\n\n\u201cWe are supportive of the overall policy\u201d of the U.S. in its negotiations with China, Tile\u2019s Prober said. But \u201cwhat\u2019s been challenging is the implementation of that policy.\u201d The company \u201conly got a few weeks\u2019 notice\u201d that its products would be subject to new tariffs before they went into effect in September, he said.\n\n(Updates with Fitbit news in the second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Candy Cheng in San Francisco at ccheng86@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark Milian\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
