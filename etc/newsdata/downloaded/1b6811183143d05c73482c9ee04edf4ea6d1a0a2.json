From the New York crews like Lo Life and rapper Thirstin Howl III \u2013 making a lifestyle out of boosting Polo Ralph Lauren from high end stores \u2013 to Dapper Dan, a Harlem designer creating custom-made outfits for rappers by printing the monograms of names like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Fendi onto tracksuits, bomber jackets and baseball caps, if those in the rap world wanted an upscale look, they had to get imaginative.\n\nRun-DMC's million-dollar deal with Adidas sparked a sea change for hip-hop's relationship with fashion.

When Def Jam label boss Russell Simmons invited Adidas executive Angelo Anastasio to see Run-DMC perform at Madison Square Garden, he saw thousands of fans holding up their footwear while chanting the words to hit track \u2018My Adidas\u2019.\n\nThis sparked the first deal of its kind, laying the groundwork for decades of collabs and endorsements between hip-hop and fashion, from Kanye West becoming Nike's first non-athlete to receive a signature shoe (the Air Yeezy), to A$AP Mob fronting a Calvin Klein campaign.\n\nDapper Dan was part of this turning tide, too. He went from opening his bootleg garms boutique in 1982 on East 125th Street, to dressing the likes of Salt N Pepa, LL Cool J and Big Daddy Kane, to being paid the ultimate fashion tribute in 2018 \u2013 when Gucci created an entire collection inspired by his archive.", "description": "The story of how hip-hop took over fashion week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07nsfy1.jpg"}
