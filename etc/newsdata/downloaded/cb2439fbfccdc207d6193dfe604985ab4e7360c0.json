But \u201cit is now that Abiy Ahmed\u2019s efforts deserve recognition and need encouragement.\u201d\n\nHuman rights groups and others have urged the prime minister to continue with reforms and resist the urge to return to repressive controls of the past such as widespread arrests and internet shutdowns.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa", "description": "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) \u2014 Ethiopia's Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister is launching a book of his ideology, with one million copies already", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/02b725_ethiopia-noble-winner-02660-man-reads-new-book-by-prime-minister-dr-abiy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
