The main reason women suffer the brunt of divorce\u2019s financial burdens, according to Jenkins, is that during marriage, they are more likely than men to stop working in order to raise kids. \u201cThe key differences are not between men and women, but between fathers and mothers,\u201d he told The Guardian.\n\nOn top of that, divorce proceedings alone can pose a serious financial burden. According to Divorce Magazine, a trade publication, the cost of divorce varies wildly, from as little as $8,500 to well over $100,000. An accurate average is hard to nail down, but estimates usually fall within the range of $15,000 to $30,000. And if the split is relatively amicable, costs can sometimes be as low as $250 to $3,000, according to Lee Borden, a divorce lawyer in Alabama.\n\nThese burdens tend to fall disproportionately on women, and, in its usual way, the market has recognized that: A handful of firms have started providing loans\u2014some of them for hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2014to women so that they can properly argue their case in court. The loans\u2019 interest rates can be high, but one firm estimates that applicants typically win assets worth three times the amount of their loan.\n\nBut without such outside help, many find themselves trapped, and it\u2019s not just women who can experience divorce\u2019s ill financial effects. Bari Weinberger, a family-law attorney working in New Jersey, says that while child support and alimony can cause hang-ups in court, it\u2019s also the case that many people simply cannot afford what they\u2019re ordered to pay, and end up defaulting because they are out of options. \u201cYou now have two households and one check to make ends meet. And it\u2019s not easy,\u201d Weinberger said. \u201cWhen men come to us looking for advice on how to handle this support, we can\u2019t create the funds that aren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nWeinberger says that because of the inevitability of alimony and child support, she advises ex-partners to make peace with paying for support before proceedings even begin. \u201cThe judge is going to order how much you pay and for how long, once you go to court, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she says. (If spouses choose to divorce via a settlement, she notes, they have a little more flexibility.)\n\nAnd alimony and child support don\u2019t always flow from ex-husband to ex-wife. Many men fear they\u2019ll be ridiculed when others find out they\u2019re receiving money from their exes, Weinberger says. Some would rather forgo their monthly stipends than swallow their pride, even if they are the stay-at-home parent bringing in no income.\n\nOf course, the messiness of life can cause serious stress before there\u2019s time to have a judge step in. When asked what she got out of her divorce, a mother in New Hampshire I spoke to simply says: \u201cdivorced.\u201d Having been married to her husband for two years and having been the mother of their child, the woman found herself without any financial safety net when they split abruptly. \u201cHe would not contribute to any expenses,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave me 15 days to get off his cellphone plan, and expected that I wouldn't default on our rent, which was $1,600 a month. I sold my cellphone for food and got a prepaid number.\u201d", "description": "There\u2019s a common perception that women siphon off the wealth of their exes and go on to live in comfort.
