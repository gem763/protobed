He also had an eight-year career in the majors as a catcher for six different teams, and hit the Giants\u2019 famous 1997 September walk-off homer against the Dodgers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe other scouts released are Steve Balboni, Darren Wittcke, Matt Nerland, Tim Rock, Glenn Tufts, Bob Mariano and Andy Skeels, the Chronicle reported.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants may be revamping their scouting department. (AP Photo)\n\nGiants looking for fresh blood, or just a sign of the times?\n\nThere are a number of reasons the Giants might be clearing out their scouting staff.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like the team is just looking for new blood after finishing under .500 for the past two years (current at .479 for 2019, third in the division), losing in the first round of the playoffs in 2016 and missing playoffs in 2015. But it\u2019s likely far more complex, and a sign of the times in baseball at large.\n\nLast November, the team brought in Farhan Zaidi as its new general manager. Zaidi got his start in baseball operations for the Oakland Athletics, working his way to director of baseball ops and assistant GM in 2014. The Dodgers made him their GM late that year, then in 2017 made their first World Series appearance in nearly 30 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nZaidi, however, is known for his analytics-based approach to to the job. Soon after his hiring, he brought in former Brewers scouting special advisor Zack Minasian to head up the Giants\u2019 pro scouting division at only 34 years old. On the amateur side, Zaidi brought in Michael Holmes, a member of the data-forward A\u2019s amateur scouting division since 2004, to lead the effort.\n\nThe nature of MLB scouting is changing\n\nThe very nature of an analytics-based approach to player scouting and that of doing it in-person are contradictory, to an extent. Last year, approximately 60 scouts lost their jobs, according to Baseball America.\n\nWhile scouting departments have generally increased in size as of late, according to The Ringer, the makeup of those departments has changed. According to reporting by Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein, scouting meetings today are often comprised of \u201cmen in their 20s and 30s, speaking up from behind team-issued iPads or laptops, fluent in complex analytics and as quick to cite spin rate as to use the traditional 20-80 scouting scale.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear at this point if the Giants are looking to simply refresh their personnel, or have something more radical in the works.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "As Bruce Bochy's final games as manager loom and veteran players' contracts expire, the Giants are reportedly moving on from other key fixtures of their 2010s success as well.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x236PrK3naP_oUn8QX4flw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B7MqUU0wdPFcHMDtAT4WTw--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f5ecde40-d434-11e9-9fe5-8521e762e382", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
