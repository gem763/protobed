They left with the expectation of meeting again later this week.\n\nThere was no immediate decision other than to wait for further developments in London and to initiate procedural steps for the new Brexit deal to be approved legally and sent to the European Parliament for ratification.\n\nIn the U.K., the second letter prompted some furious reaction from Johnson's political opponents, who said that he was acting to undermine the law. Some suggested legal action could be taken against him should he appear to be advocating for EU27 leaders to deny the extension request.\n\nNext steps\n\nLegal or not \u2014 in reality, such lobbying would have little impact in Brussels.\n\nThe EU27, anticipating further ratification difficulties in London, were already calculating how best to use the continuing British political chaos to their best advantage \u2014 mainly by using it to further convince the British public that Brussels has never obstructed the U.K.'s departure and is not responsible for the delay.\n\nBeyond cementing EU victory in the so-called blame game, diplomat and officials said EU leaders' main goal has not changed: to do everything possible to eliminate any risk that the U.K. would leave in a chaotic and economically disastrous no-deal scenario. They also don't want to be drawn into the middle of the domestic political fight in the U.K.\n\nSome EU officials and diplomats said that they expect leaders to move slowly, given that there are still 11 days until the October 31 deadline and that events in Westminster \u2014 very much outside of the EU's control \u2014 could make the extension request irrelevant.\n\nJohnson has made clear he wants to move forward with legislation needed for the U.K. to depart on October 31, and is hoping to soon hold a so-called meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement, perhaps on Tuesday.\n\n\"We have time,\" one EU diplomat said.\n\nAfter Sunday morning's meeting, another diplomat said: \"The EU decision regarding the next steps will be taken after the clarification of the situation in the British parliament.\"\n\nOfficials are grappling with the hole in the budget that will be left by the U.K.'s departure.\n\nWhile some EU27 leaders, notably French President Emmanuel Macron, have expressed frustration with British dithering and urged that the October 31 deadline be respected, any overt pressure, including threats of refusing to grant an extension, would risk alienating Johnson's opponents, including members of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats who oppose Brexit, not to mention avidly pro-EU forces like the Scottish National Party.\n\nOne key factor that has changed from the previous two extension requests is that the forces pushing for delay in London are not opposed to the current Brexit deal as much as they seem to want to prevent Brexit altogether, or at least to force either a national election or another referendum allowing the British public a say on the new Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nBut while some EU leaders have said they are still hoping Brexit doesn't happen \u2014 notably Tusk who said Thursday \"in my heart I will always be a Remainer\" \u2014 a reversal is not necessarily as appealing for Brussels as it might seem.\n\nIf Brexit is stopped but British society remains deeply divided, with a large segment of the population opposing the EU, the U.K.'s continued membership could prove deeply problematic as British officials constantly calibrate their decision-making to take account of the domestic mood.\n\nEven without the U.K.'s current active participation, some EU officials are frustrated that the bloc, which must approve most policy initiatives unanimously, cannot act quickly or decisively enough.\n\nLength of delay\n\nIf EU27 leaders find themselves nearing October 31 and London is still deadlocked, they have a range of options. While Johnson's letter followed the law in requesting a delay until the end of January, the EU27 are under no obligation to agree to that specific date.\n\nA shorter extension is possible, but could be seen as pressuring the U.K. parliament to ratify the current deal \u2014 as there is widespread agreement that a British election could not be organized until December at the earliest. A short extension, however, could potentially be more appealing to leaders like Macron who have expressed impatience.\n\nOpting for the January 31 date would leave open the possibility of a new vote in Britain, and has another advantage in that it would clearly not require any further negotiation or consultation with the U.K. It would also show the EU is not meddling by giving London no more or less than what it requested.\n\nAnother possibility is that the EU could extend the deadline much further, closer to December 31, 2020 \u2014 currently the end date of the transition period called for in the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nWhile that would make Brexit very much London's problem, there are practical obstacles to a long delay \u2014 particularly the EU's need to push forward with negotiations on its next long-term budget.\n\nIt's not clear that Tusk will indeed convene another leaders' gathering.\n\nOfficials are grappling with the hole in the budget that will be left by the U.K.'s departure, and continuing uncertainty would further complicate what is an already excruciatingly difficult process.\n\nIn his second letter, Johnson graciously offered to come to Brussels for an additional European Council before the October 31 deadline and apologized to Tusk that the Brexit matter was dragging on.\n\n\"If it would be helpful to you, of course I would be happy to attend,\" he wrote.\n\nBut it's not clear that Tusk will indeed convene another leaders' gathering. While normally leaders would prefer to gather around the table to discuss such a big decision in person, if a clear consensus emerges, there are legal mechanisms by which the EU could approve the delay through a written procedure.\n\nThe European Commission, which led the negotiations for the EU side, said it is awaiting further word from London. \"It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible,\" the Commission's chief spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said Saturday in a statement after the extension request was sent.\n\nShe did not say if the clock is still ticking.\n\nAnca Gurzu contributed reporting.", "description": "EU ambassadors met Sunday after Boris Johnson sent a letter asking for a short extension.", "authors": ["David M.
