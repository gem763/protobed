The complaint\u2019s existence was revealed in court filings earlier, though it failed to garner much public attention. Two Trump administration officials downplayed the complaint due to the fact that it is based on \u201chearsay\u201d and suggested it could have been prompted by political bias.\n\nRep. Richard E. Neal (D-MA), who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, received the complaint in July and claims it includes evidence of \u201cpotential \u2018inappropriate efforts to influence\u2019 the audit program.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reports:\n\nThe whistleblower, a career official at the IRS, confirmed in an interview with The Washington Post this week that he had filed a formal complaint and sent it to the tax committee chairs in both houses of Congress, including Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), and to the Treasury Department Inspector General for Tax Administration on July 29. [\u2026]\n\nNeal has not revealed whether the whistleblower complaint is about Trump or Pence, but he said in an August court filing that the allegations \u201ccast doubt\u201d on the Trump administration\u2019s contention that there is no reason for concern that IRS employees could face interference when auditing a president\u2019s tax returns. [\u2026] The Post has been unable to verify the allegation in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint of improper communication between Treasury and IRS on the tax audit program.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has disclosed to Neal that his office transmitted the complaint to the inspector general.\n\nIn June, the House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department and the IRS in an effort to obtain President Trump\u2019s tax returns. At the time, Neal said his panel doesn\u2019t need to justify why lawmakers seek the president\u2019s tax return information. The panel stated that the administration defied a subpoena for the records \u201cin order to shield President Trump\u2019s tax return information from Congressional scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the nation\u2019s voluntary tax system,\u201d read the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe Committee has been unable to evaluate President Trump\u2019s claims about the audit program or investigate its other concerns because the President has declined to follow the practice of every elected President since Richard Nixon of voluntarily disclosing their tax returns,\u201d court filings state.\n\n\u201cWithout reviewing the requested return materials, the committee cannot ensure that the IRS\u2019s audit process is functioning fairly and effectively, understand how provisions of the tax code are implicated by President Trump\u2019s returns, or exercise its legislative judgment to determine whether changes to the code may be warranted,\u201d it continues.\n\nThe Treasury Department did not issue a statement in response to the Post\u2019s report.\n\nThe AP contributed to this report.", "description": "An IRS bureaucrat reportedly filed a \"whistleblower\" complaint claiming he received information that at least one Treasury official moved to \"improperly interfere\" with Trump's tax returns.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178821538-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
