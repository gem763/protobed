How about J.Lo and Constance Wu passed out on a kitchen floor after testing the potent blend of ketamine and MDMA they\u2019ll serve to unsuspecting male clients? Cardi B\u2019s lap routine? Lili Reinhart vomiting en route to jail?\n\nEverything in Lorene Scafaria\u2019s crime romp \u2014 based on events chronicled in a 2015 New York magazine story \u2014 is a delight. What starts as a pop pageant about New York strippers earning their wealth becomes a smart rhapsody about a cabal of clever women defrauding patrons in order to weather the 2008 economic crash.\n\nWhen veteran dancer Ramona (Lopez) takes struggling rookie Destiny (Wu) under her wing, the pair emerge an unrelenting duo. But first, Ramona has to teach Destiny all the right moves. Which meant Lopez had to learn them, too.\n\nEven though she\u2019s a trained performer with years of touring to her name, Lopez spent almost four months working with a pole-dancing instructor. Most of her prep went into a mind-boggling scene that finds Ramona demonstrating for Destiny a series of standard pole maneuvers, all requiring intense leg and ab prowess. Reciting terminology that is clearly second nature to her, Ramona shows off about a dozen positions: the knee hook, the carousel, the butterfly, the Peter Pan, the tabletop, the martini. Her instructions are tantamount to the training-sequence trope that\u2019s common in underdog films such as \u201cRocky,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d and \u201cMulan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to present this like a sports movie and highlight the athleticism of it and the strength and the power of it,\u201d Scarfaria said last week over coffee at a Manhattan hotel.\n\nSTXfilms Jennifer Lopez and Lorene Scafaria on the set of \"Hustlers.\"\n\nJohanna Sapakie, a choreographer who has a decade of aerial experience in Cirque du Soleil, gave Lopez a \u201ccrash course\u201d in \u201call things pole\u201d to perfect the \u201cCriminal\u201d arrangement and Ramona\u2019s subsequent lecture. In hourlong sessions at Lopez\u2019s homes, Lopez learned how to employ upper-body fortitude to hold herself on the pole and twirl upside down. They\u2019re hardly beginner moves, and Lopez had to seem like a virtuoso. The student needed to become the teacher. At the start of their collaboration, Sapakie told Lopez a version of what Ramona tells Destiny after the latter voices self-doubt: \u201cEvery woman can do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted something that clearly indicated that this is a woman that\u2019s been doing this a long time,\u201d Sapakie said. \u201cWhen we started working on it, it was very challenging. And watching the playback on the monitors of her doing it [during the shoot], you just see this smile on her face when she\u2019s upside down holding on with just her hand. Literally, there\u2019s just this glorious smile on her face. It can\u2019t be faked.\u201d\n\nScafaria, whose previous credits include \u201cThe Meddler\u201d and \u201cSeeking a Friend for the End of the World,\u201d wrote the names of the pole positions into the script. They don\u2019t correspond to the technical terms adopted by competitive pole dancers and the corresponding fitness movement because in strip clubs women often invent their own lingo. Since the movie\u2019s lucrative opening weekend, Sapakie has read online forums in which pole veterans assume the movie is misidentifying common nomenclature. In actuality, Scafaria\u2019s intent was to remain authentic to the strip-club experience.\n\n\u201cAnd every city has a different dance style,\u201d said Jacqueline Frances (aka Jacq the Stripper), who consulted on the project. \u201cEvery club you go to, there\u2019s a different groove, there\u2019s a different move, there\u2019s a different lap dance. And depending on what kind of pole there is and where it is and what kind of literal hardware you have to work with, the whole style changes. There\u2019s a chin-up bar at one of the clubs in Midtown, so girls are there doing chin-ups. It\u2019s just like, \u2018What do ya got? I need to make money. Let\u2019s make it creative.\u2019 It\u2019s all about being resourceful, which is what this whole movie is about.\u201d\n\nThe coaching scene conveys control, a motif introduced in the Janet Jackson song that opens the film. That applies to Ramona and to Lopez herself. At 50 years old, Lopez is enjoying her fiercest role since 1998\u2019s \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d underscoring a bewitching screen presence that never went away. Ramona possesses an expert ability to sell her personality, and so does the woman who inhabits her. (Try watching \u201cThe Wedding Planner\u201d without swooning for Lopez. You can\u2019t.) Ramona instructs Destiny how to use her body so authority rests with her instead of the men tossing dollar bills onto the stage. Once she\u2019s confident in her skills, Destiny can manipulate customers into spending more.\n\nSTXfilms Constance Wu, some dude and Jennifer Lopez in \"Hustlers.\"\n\nThe scene\u2019s flair lies in Lopez\u2019s dazzle and the surprising music that guides it. instead of a pumped-up anthem, we hear a graceful Chopin \u00e9tude. Ramona\u2019s skills are as much art as they are recreation, ballet and calisthenics all in one.\n\nChopin appears a few times in \u201cHustlers,\u201d contrasting a soundtrack that will be remembered for its Janet Jackson, Britney Spears and Lorde classics. Because pop music is sometimes mistaken as a medium that lacks substance, Scafaria\u2019s use of Chopin adds an ironic edge to the proceedings. An esteemed 19th-century composer couldn\u2019t have anticipated that his work would one day score a pole-dancing tutorial and a mosaic celebrating strippers\u2019 camaraderie, but why shouldn\u2019t it? Scafaria included the classical numbers in the script and even pitched the movie to studio executives using a montage featuring actual strippers shimmying to Chopin.\n\n\u201cThose specific studies are so hard to play,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they are what they are. They\u2019re these arpeggios that require so much flexibility and dexterity that nobody can play them, truly. We really had to track down this unbelievable pianist whose recordings I had been editing to for years. Thank God we got the rights to that because you can\u2019t even just get, like, the greatest Chopin pianist of all time who\u2019s won all these awards. You can\u2019t just sit down and bust one of those out.\u201d\n\nRamona and Destiny\u2019s teamwork is fruitful, letting them fleece Wall Street bigwigs whose swollen pocketbooks sometimes come at the expense of middle-class Americans. And when the women join forces again post-recession, they find other ways to max out men\u2019s credit cards \u2015 at least until those efforts turn, well, criminal. Call it entrepreneurial, call it abuse, call it whatever you like.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people look at strippers doing their jobs and even think that they\u2019re earning a living,\u201d Scafaria said. \u201cIt\u2019s about all the power dynamics that we are all up against. There are so many moments that we\u2019re out of control, or so many moments that we want to feel like we\u2019re in control. The value system is pretty broken, what women and men are valued for. I wanted to talk about all of that. The theme of control just seems to seep into every other aspect of our culture. Every headline, I think, is actually a trickle down of that broken value system.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the impact of \u201cHustlers\u201d is best summarized by Ramona\u2019s final words, delivered to a journalist (Julia Stiles) documenting the fallout from her swindling scheme: \u201cThis whole country is a strip club. You\u2019ve got people tossing the money and people doing the dance.\u201d In two succinct sentences, Ramona digests the exploits of modern capitalism, gendered and otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe rules of the club are the rules of the world,\u201d Scarfaia said. \u201cIn this place, there\u2019s an exchange of goods, there\u2019s a supply and demand. Obviously, it\u2019s also a crime drama. Women doing bad things seems to turn people off sometimes, so I really wanted to tell a story with empathy and authenticity, at least, and leave it up to the audiences to see what it does to them. It may make them feel uncomfortable. It may make them feel overjoyed.
