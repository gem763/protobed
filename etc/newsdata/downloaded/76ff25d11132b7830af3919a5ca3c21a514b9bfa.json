It\u2019s my time to shine,\u2019 Demi wrote.\n\nNow, let them eat cake!\n\nCardi B\n\nIf you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it (Picture: MediaPunch/BACKGRID)\n\nSexy Halloween costumes can get a bad rap, but we bow down to Cardi B as she embraced one of the classics as a sexy nurse.\n\nThe mum-of-one took to the stage with husband Offset in New Jersey on Friday where she showed off her impressive rap ability and legend costume chops in a low cut mini-dress, thigh-high boots and long red wig.\n\nKylie Jenner\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOpting to recreate a classic pop culture moment was Kylie Jenner, who with the help of her bestie Stassi transformed into Madonna and Britney Spears circa the 2003 MTV VMAs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn case you don\u2019t see where this is going, the girls then proceeded to share a quick peck like the popstars did on-stage while performing Like A Virgin and Hollywood.\n\nParis Hilton\n\nNever one to do anything by halves, we\u2019re obsessed with Paris Hilton\u2019s She-Ra costume from her now iconic Halloween do.\n\nBecause if there\u2019s one item of clothing we should all wear more, it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 cape.\n\nHalsey and Evan Peters\n\nI got you babe (Picture: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)\n\nPop star Halsey finally confirmed her romance with American Horror Story star Evan Peters this weekend by partnering up for an amazingly coordinated Sonny and Cher costume.\n\nThe couple were all kinds of matching with Halsey in a multi-coloured polka dot asymmetrical dress, while Evan rocked a similar shirt with a white suit jacket and trousers. Oh, and an amazing handlebar moustache.\n\nConfirming your relationship status with a couple\u2019s costume? Honestly iconic.\n\nAshley Graham\n\nPregnant model Ashley Graham took inspiration from queen of Halloween Heidi Klum (albeit in a slightly less terrifying way) as she dressed as Jessica Rabbit from the iconic film Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\n\nIn a bump-hugging latex dress and long red wig, Ashley\u2019s showing that pregnant women can still look sexy as hell and we respect.\n\nSnoop Dogg\n\nReminding us that Halloween costumes are actually supposed to be scary, we\u2019re fully terrified by the sight of Snoop Dogg smoking in his creepy Joker mask.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe may be wearing his normal baggy clothes and necklace, but with a mask this freaky, we\u2019re still impressed with the rapper\u2019s commitment to a costume.\n\nHolly Willoughby\n\nDressing as the Joker\u2019s accomplice Harley Quinn, Holly Willoughby gave 2016\u2019s costume-du-jour a Birds of Prey twist as she appeared on Celebrity Juice\u2019s Halloween special.\n\nWith a spangly jacket, pink vest top and the iconic pink and blue pigtails, the This Morning presenter was the spitting image of actress Margot Robbie.\n\nAnyone else really want to recreate this costume themselves?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
