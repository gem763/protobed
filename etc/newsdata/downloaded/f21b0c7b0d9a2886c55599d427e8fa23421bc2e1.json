Short flights are most damaging per passenger mile. From an hour onward CO2 emissions per passenger mile start to reduce.\n\nBut by the time a flight extends beyond six or seven hours, the fuel carried becomes very significant and the rate per passenger mile increases more sharply than the increase in distance. Ultra-long-haul aviation is especially damaging.\n\nThe aircraft used was brand new, and effectively Qantas extended a routine delivery flight \u2013 flying it first to Los Angeles and then to New York. So it did not fly the aircraft from its base in Sydney.\n\nOn the journey to Australia it caught up with the normal daily QF12 flight which connects New York with Los Angeles, where a plane change is made to a larger Airbus A380 to Sydney.\n\nA spokesperson for Qantas said: \u201cIn terms of fuel burn and emissions, the direct flight was no worse than a normal stopover in Los Angeles and possibly a lot better given you remove the taxing and possible inbound delays which occur frequently from a stopover.\n\n\u201cAlso, the emissions from the flight were offset.\u201d\n\nThe airline says that one in 10 Qantas customers chooses to offset their flights, compared with the industry standard of one in 100.\n\nWhile some media reports have described the New York-Sydney trip as \u201cthe world\u2019s longest commercial flight,\u201d it was neither a commercial flight nor the longest flight involving a commercial airliner; Qantas made a longer and much more damaging flight three decades ago when it flew a Boeing 747 from London to Sydney.\n\nIn 2018, Qantas launched nonstop flights between Heathrow and Perth in Western Australia. At 9,009 miles, the link is the third-longest in the world, after the Singapore Airlines link from Singapore to New York (9,529 miles) and Qatar Airways\u2019 daily service from Doha to Auckland (9,032 miles).", "description": "The first-ever flight from New York to Sydney has been deplored by climate-change campaigners.
