REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nMADRID (Reuters) - The outlook for the U.S. economy is \u201cquite good\u201d but modest monetary policy adjustments will not be enough to offset potential economic shocks, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Thursday.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates twice this year as U.S. businesses were hit by rising trade tensions with China, political risk including Britain\u2019s potentially chaotic divorce from the European Union, and weakening economic growth in Germany and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIf there is an event that shocks the world economy or the U.S. economy, these modest adjustments are not going to be nearly enough, this is very much just risk management to help make things work out better as we strive to bring in growth at about 2% (in the U.S.) over the next 18 months,\u201d Evans told a conference in Madrid.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. economy continues to grow above trend ... U.S. economic outlook is quite good, it still has strong fundamentals,\u201d he said, adding though that trade tensions remained downside risks, potentially putting off investment decisions by companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wall Street\u2019s main indexes suffered their sharpest one-day declines in nearly six weeks after employment and manufacturing data suggested that the U.S.-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the U.S. economy.\n\nAdding to trade concerns, the United States won approval on Wednesday to levy import tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods over illegal EU subsidies handed to Airbus (AIR.PA), threatening to trigger a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war.", "description": "The outlook for the U.S. economy is \"quite good\" but modest monetary policy adjustments will not be enough to offset potential economic shocks, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436568706&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920K3"}
