It\u2019s a good result but there is plenty to work on.\n\n\u201cThe overall feeling is that we took our foot off the gas a bit in the second half.\u201d\n\nNO HANGOVER\n\nWith the furore surrounding the return to Wales of attack coach Rob Howley for an alleged breach of betting rules, it was a far from ideal build-up to the tournament for Warren Gatland\u2019s side, but they showed no signs of a hangover.\n\nA simple skip-pass allowed Davies to dot down under the posts, before a break from scrumhalf Gareth Davies was finished off by Tipuric.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s accuracy with their kicking out of hand was poor as they were pinned back in their own half. They were not quick enough in thought or action, and their ponderous possession was easy for their opponents to defend against.\n\nThe pressure told as Wales scored a third inside 20 minutes, a fine solo try from Adams after he was put through a big hole in the Georgian defence.\n\nWales had to wait until the end of the first half to secure their bonus-point try as they shifted the ball quickly out wide for Liam Williams to score.\n\nThe pre-game talk had been of the power of the Georgian forwards and the first sign of it came when they produced two excellent driving mauls and crossed the line through Mamukashvili.\n\nTomos Williams chased down a kick to score Wales\u2019s fifth try before Chilachava burrowed over after more powerful Georgian forward play. North finished the scoring when he stretched to dot down with four minutes remaining.", "description": "Wales produced a tale of two halves as an electric start secured a deserved 43-14 bonus-point victory over Georgia in their Rugby World Cup Pool D clash on Monday, before they wilted in the energy-sapping humidity at the City of Toyota Stadium.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432955557&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M11W", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
