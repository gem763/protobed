United \u2014 kicked things off by accusing someone of leaking stories to the tabloid press based on her personal, private Instagram account. She pointed the finger at Rebekah Vardy, wife of the Leicester City and England striker Jamie Vardy.\n\nIt had all started, Rooney said, when suspecting a mole she blocked everyone following her except for the account she thought belonged to the leaker.\n\nOver a period of five months, Rooney posted about a series of fake events to see if they would turn up in The Sun newspaper, which pumps out stories about the country's WAGs, as the wives and girlfriends of male professional athletes are known.\n\n\"And you know what, they did!\" Rooney wrote.\n\nThese included a fake story about her traveling to Mexico to get \"gender selection treatment\" for her unborn baby and a basement flooding.\n\nVardy denied being behind the leaks.\n\nOn Twitter the episode gained the hashtag #WAGathaChristie, an amalgamation of the British tabloid term for the partners of footballers, WAGs, and the mystery novelist.
