I was not allowed to invite her.\n\nKate previously spoke of her strained relationship with her father (Picture: Getty Images\n\n\u2018But it was never awkward between me and Kate, it was awkward between me and her mother.\u2019\n\nKate told You Magazine back in August 2018: \u2018I will never forget that. So that\u2019s a big point because I don\u2019t ever want Rio\u2019s kids to feel how I felt when I was younger.\u2019\n\nIt seems Phil, 59, couldn\u2019t be more impressed with Kate\u2019s choice of husband and praised his new son-in-law Rio.\n\n\u2018He is great. He seems to have his head screwed on right,\u2019 he said before adding cheekily: \u2018And no doubt he will introduce me to Chelsea\u2019s manager Frank Lampard one day.\u2019\n\nRio, 40, admitted he was overwhelmed with emotion while marrying Kate and \u2018cried\u2019 when he saw his beautiful bride in her wedding dress for the first time.\n\nThe former footballer told OK! Magazine: \u2018I cried as soon as the day started. Seeing Tia walk up the aisle before Kate set me off. It was just so emotional.\n\n\u2018There was just no going back on the emotion, that\u2019s why I had to keep my shades on! Seeing Tate and Lorenz walk Kate down the aisle was particularly poignant and we wouldn\u2019t have wanted to do it any other way.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
