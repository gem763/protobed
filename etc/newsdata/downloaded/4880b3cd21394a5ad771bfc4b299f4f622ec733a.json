NexTech is directing its proprietary 3D asset creation technology, previously used for WebAR clients, to create content for Google\u2019s new 3D ad platform positioning both companies to be at the forefront of the emerging 3D-AR market. Over the next 30 days the company will be working directly with Google to launch its first 3D \u201cSwirl ads\u201d ads.\n\n\n\nAs explained by Google:\n\n\"Swirl brings three-dimensional assets to display advertising on the mobile web, which can help educate consumers before making a purchase. They can directly zoom in and out, rotate a product, or play an animation.\"\n\n\"We are excited to be working directly with Google on their new 3D ads platform which is the first step in bringing fully immersive AR ads to market expected to launch in 2020. Companies are looking for ways to rapidly transform 2D assets to 3D assets for advertising, eCommerce and training. With our state of the art 3D capture capabilities, NexTech is the first AR company to offer the industry's first end-to-end solution for advertisers and brands from the creation of 3D assets, online 3D display ads, WebAR 3D product views, 3D shopping experiences, and ultimately leading to the purchasing of goods all in a frictionless and seamless 3D virtual environment. Our 3D-AR solutions work incredibly well with all major platforms and add tremendous value providing rich product experience to online shoppers who are craving more and more when making online purchasing decisions,\" said Evan Gappelberg, CEO of NexTech.\n\nAvailable through Google's Display and Video 360 formats, \u201cSwirl ads\u201d will enable brands which have existing 3D assets to build them into their ad units. In this instance NexTech will be building the 3D assets to meet Google's 3D display process which involves; creating the 3D asset, coming up with a creative, publishing in DV360 and then monitoring the campaign metrics.\n\nThe 3D models can then be spun, enlarged, and interacted with directly by the consumer within the ad itself. Split-testing by Sketchfab-branded 3D ads versus traditional static ads bears out just how dramatically engagement can improve, showing a 633% increase in sign-up conversions and a 376% increase in click-through rates.\n\nBrands and retailers can implement NexTech's 3D AR ads through a few simple lines of Web AR embed codes, providing the versatility to create interactive ads that are compatible with all major ad networks, including Google Ad Network and Doubleclick (DFP). Brands can publish 3D ads, which are cross-browser and cross-device capable, from the same assets utilized to create Web AR images with no additional work required, other than building the ad itself.\n\neMarketer forecasted last year that digital ads will account for 50% of total eCommerce ad spending by 2020, at more than $357 billion. NexTech, through its continued push for innovation, is well-positioned to grow alongside the largest ad platforms in the world.\n\nNexTech's 3D ads enable consumers to experience products for themselves while shopping online, from any angle and with rich, true rendering. Providing consumers the ability to fully review an item for size, shape, color and fit before purchasing online can ultimately lead to greater revenues and reduced returns for online retailers.\n\nNexTech now offers innovative and engaging 3D AR advertising experiences, positioning the Company to quickly penetrate the rapidly growing 3D ads market.\n\nAbout NexTech AR Solutions Corp.\n\nNexTech is one of the leaders in the rapidly growing AR industry, estimated to hit $120 billion by 2022, according to Statista.
