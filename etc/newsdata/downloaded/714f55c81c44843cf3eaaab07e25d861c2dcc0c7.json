think of them as sisters, not twins.\u2019\n\nReshaping your labia is a big deal\n\nA growing number of women are interested in this type of surgery, but Dr Gunter says there is often no medical need for it.\n\n\u2018Most women seeking it have labia well within the typical range,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s also important to remember the labia minora are sexually responsive structures with erectile tissue,\u2019 she adds.\n\nThe labial lips have a role to play in sexual pleasure, and they also help protect the vaginal opening.\n\nIn short, think very carefully before you meddle with them.\n\n\u2018Surgically reducing the labia should be considered the same thing as surgically reducing the penis,\u2019 Dr Gunter says.\n\nThere\u2019s more than one way to please a clitoris\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThere\u2019s so much to the clitoris than you might realise - the visible bit is just the tip of a very sexy iceberg.\n\n\u2018Below the surface, it branches around the urethra, vagina and labia, and every part is capable of sexual sensation,\u2019 says Dr Gunter.\n\n\u2018It can be accessed in many ways that don\u2019t involve direct contact with the glans, which for some women is too sensitive to touch directly.\u2019\n\n\u2018Moving stimulation to other areas may actually be a better pathway to orgasm.\u2019\n\nThe G-spot doesn\u2019t exist\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, guys, but only a third of women can orgasm from penetration alone.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s because the magical G-spot inside the vagina doesn\u2019t actually exist.\n\n\u2018The G spot was supposedly identified by Dr. Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg in 1950, but his paper did not describe a special spot but an \u201cerotic zone\u201d in the front of the vagina,\u2019 explains Dr Gunter.\n\n\u2018It was probably describing the body, root and bulbs of the clitoris as they envelop the urethra.\u2019\n\n\u2018The lower part of the vagina feels great for some women because it\u2019s accessing the clitoris.\u2019\n\n\u2018Basically, all pleasure roads lead to the clitoris.\u2019\n\nFood can\u2019t change the smell of your vagina\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nFirst of all, Dr Gunter wants you to know there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with the scent of a healthy vagina - so please stop trying to change it.\n\nBesides, your diet doesn\u2019t make the slightest difference to your smell.\n\n\u2018The biggest contributors to vaginal scent are substances produced by healthy vaginal bacteria, lactobacilli,\u2019 Dr Gunter explains.\n\n\u2018Food will not affect your vagina\u2019s lactobacilli.\u2019\n\n\u2018If you have a concerning vaginal odour, see a doctor.\n\n'The remedy is definitely not at the supermarket.'\n\nSugar can\u2019t give you a yeast infection\n\nOK, your vaginal fluid does contain sugar (in the form of glycogen and glucose) but it comes from your body\u2019s cells, not your food.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not possible to change the sugar level in your vagina through diet,\u2019 Dr Gunter says.\n\nYou can also stop worrying that beer, bread or wine could give you a yeast infection (they don\u2019t even contain the type of yeast involved in thrush).\n\n\u2018The idea of an anti-candida diet is simply not supported by basic biology or research,\u2019 says Dr Gunter.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with using lube\n\nThere are lots of reasons why we use lube - fun, comfort, reducing condom breakage - and we shouldn\u2019t feel bad about any of them.\n\n\u2018Vaginal lubrication is part of the sexual response cycle but it can vary from day to day,\u2019 says Dr Gunter.\n\n\u2018Sometimes your mind is raring to go and your body hasn\u2019t caught up yet, so a boost from a bottle can get you there faster.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think of lubricant in the way I think of glasses - some people have always needed them, some of us need glasses as we age, and some just need glasses for reading.\u2019\n\n\u2018No one is judgy about glasses.\u2019\n\nBut don\u2019t be afraid to ask about dryness\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIf you\u2019re suddenly experiencing vaginal dryness, Dr Gunter says it\u2019s a good idea to get it checked out.\n\n\u2018The most common cause is menopause, but other causes of vaginal dryness include a yeast infection, breastfeeding and oestrogen-free contraception.\u2019\n\nYou should never wash inside your vagina\n\nThe vaginal opening is the same tissue as the inside of the vagina so it simply doesn\u2019t need to be washed.\n\n\u2018The labia minora do not have odour-producing sweat glands,\u2019 says Dr Gunter.\n\nSo don\u2019t douche - it puts you at risk of bacterial vaginosis (an overgrowth of bad bacteria) by killing good bacteria, and can irritate the sensitive skin of the labia.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a special \u201cfeminine\u201d wash either\n\nBeen using the same product to wash down below for years and never had a problem?\n\n\u2018What you are doing is probably fine as long as you are not cleaning inside your vagina,\u2019 says Dr Gunter.\n\nSkin loses moisture as you get older, so if you\u2019re using soap now, Dr Gunter says you might want to switch to cleanser, which is less drying, \u2018as a preventative measure\u2019.\n\nKeep your vagina away from....\n\nDr Jen Gunter reveals the things you shouldn\u2019t be putting inside you\n\nJade eggs\n\nEggs for your \u2018yoni\u2019, popularised by my pal Gwyneth Paltrow, are promoted as an ancient secret of Chinese concubines and queens.\n\nIt is not - the only thing ancient about it is the absence of science.\n\nLasers and injections\n\nUnder no circumstances can I recommend the G-shot (fillers injected into the vaginal wall), the O-shot (clitoral injections), or stem-cell injections.\n\nLaser to treat menopausal symptoms and incontinence is understudied, and there is no data about using these devices to \u201ctighten\u201d the vagina.\n\nSteam\n\nVaginal steaming is promoted to \u201ccleanse\u201d the uterus\u2019.\n\nThis ties into a destructive myth that the uterus is unclean.\n\nLive yogurt for yeast infections\n\nYogurt doesn\u2019t contain the strains of lactobacilli that are important for vaginal health.\n\nWhen a woman puts yogurt in her vagina, she is putting other bacteria there, as yogurt has live cultures, and the consequences are unknown.\n\nIt may feel soothing because it is cream-like, but it will be ineffective.\n\nTea tree oil for yeast infections\n\nTea tree oil is an endocrine disruptor and a common cause of irritation.\n\nThere are no published studies showing that it is effective, and the impact on the health of vaginal bacteria is unknown.\n\nBecause that is what you want for your vagina, right?\n\nAn endocrine disruptor with an unknown effect!\n\n- Adapted from The Vagina Bible by Dr Jen Gunter, \u00a314.99, Little Brown", "description": "Gynaecologist and social media star Dr Jen Gunter is out to debunk the myriad myths about your intimate parts", "authors": ["Lynne Hyland", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20387884.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS193645592.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
