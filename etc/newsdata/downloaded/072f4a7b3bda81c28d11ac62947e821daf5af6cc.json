That's predominantly thanks to poor performance from WeWork, and ride-hailing firm Uber which went public in May.\n\nA SoftBank spokesman declined to comment on the report. The company's shares fell 1.2% in Tokyo.\n\nSince spinning off its namesake telecom unit SoftBank Corp, analysts now view SoftBank as a financial holding company. More akin to a bank, the company is taking on more debt and relying on cash flows from its operating units to pay the interest.\n\n\"From a leverage standpoint, SoftBank has some cushion to take on additional debt,\" said Moody's analyst Motoki Yanase.\n\nAlthough SoftBank has an army of retail investors in yield-strapped Japan willing to buy its junk bonds, it already holds about 5 trillion yen of net debt on its balance sheet \u2014 more than half its 9 trillion yen market capitalization.\n\nBoth Moody's and S&P Global rate SoftBank below investment grade. That means the company has to pay higher interest on its bonds and loans. The company's weighted average cost of debt is 3.7%, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nEven so, SoftBank retains huge holdings in listed companies that could be sold off if the company needs cash, said S&P analyst Hiroyuki Nishikawa.\n\nPortfolio companies backed by SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund include British chip designer ARM, Slack Technologies Inc, and ride-hailing firms such as Uber Technologies Inc, Grab and Didi.\n\nJefferies downgraded SoftBank stock to hold from buy on Friday, saying that WeWork rescue sets an \"undesirable precedent\" for the group's private investments.\n\n\"We don't know where the risk limit is for SoftBank given they have bet so heavily,\" said Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal. Among more typical private equity funds \"most of them probably let go of the failures, they don't double down\".", "description": "Some of SoftBank's star investments \u2014 WeWork and Uber \u2014 have cratered over the last six months.", "authors": ["Rocky Swift", "Junko Fujita"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c6aa952342cca2e2b678fe5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
