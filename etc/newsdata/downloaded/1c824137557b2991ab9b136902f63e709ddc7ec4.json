We reject the withdrawal.\n\n\u201cWhen the council sits, the ANC position will be to present the resignation and the ANC councillors will have a mandate to endorse the resignation and declare a vacancy which will be filled immediately,\u201d Ntuli said.\n\n\u201cThere is no motion of confidence that will be necessary because there is a letter of resignation so there is no mayor to remove because there is no mayor; the mayor resigned. The withdrawal does not exist,\u201d he said.\n\nThe provincial secretary insisted that there were no plans yet to discipline Gumede for her defiance, saying that they would continue to choose to engage with her.\n\n\u201cWe just want to engage with her first and make sure she understands the implications of what she is doing.\u201d\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal provincial working committee will meet tomorrow to discuss the meeting with the officials and the way forward should it be necessary to take further action.\n\nGumede had knocked on the door of Luthuli House two weeks ago asking for an audience with the officials, which she was granted.\n\nRead: Why Zandile Gumede was finally removed from office\n\nCity Press understands that part of her presentation to the top six was her belief that the PEC wanted to get rid of her by any means necessary. Gumede has allegedly argued that she was essentially \u201cexonerated\u201d, by two reports which were tabled at the national executive committee (NEC).\n\nIn July NEC member Zweli Mkhize presented a report back to the NEC on a number of troubled municipalities governed by the ANC. Gumede insists that, if she was the source of the ANC\u2019s woes in eThekwini, Mkhize would have made the recommendation then that she be given the boot.\n\nWeeks later NEC member Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma \u2013 who is also the minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs \u2013 met structures in eThekwini. Gumede is said to have pointed out that Dlamini-Zuma did not recommend that she be axed.\n\nFollowing the relaxation of Gumede\u2019s bail conditions, the court gave her the green light to return to the city, a move she believed foiled the plans to get rid of her using her legal challengesas the trigger.\n\nGumede, with other city officials, was arrested earlier this year on charges of money laundering, racketeering and corruption. She is out on R50 000 bail with her case set to resume in January 2020.\n\nIn the end it was a report by a task team headed by John Jeffery and Nhlanhla Ngidi which sealed her fate. City Press had reported that Gumede and her supporters had cried foul that Ngidi was conflicted, claiming that he had ambitions for the city\u2019s top job.\n\nThis week Ngidi confirmed in a media interview that he had been approached to serve as deputy mayor after being lobbied to serve as mayor.\n\nNtuli said tomorrow\u2019s meeting in the main would likely be about Gumede\u2019s concerns about the process leading up to her removal.\n\n\u201cThe reason we have a meeting is because comrade Zandile went there and raised her concerns, so I suspect the meeting may be centred on Zandile\u2019s concerns other than the process,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will be reporting why we have chosen [Mxolisi] Kaunda, why we believe he is the appropriate candidate. We will explain that we had extensive discussions and looked at a number of options; if they want a rundown of who the options were we can provide that as well. But the likelihood is that they will be interested in the choice we made rather than what we discussed.\u201d", "description": "Embattled former eThekwini regional chairperson Zandile Gumede is pinning her hopes on the ANC\u2019s top six taking her side when they meet the KwaZulu-Natal provincial executive committee over its decision to recall her.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9183/cd48ddbff51b49d79fc8f4783bbe8a11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
