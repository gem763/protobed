Building walls is in fashion, and it's not just Trump who says so.\n\nSince the Berlin Wall fell, they've flourished. Especially after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Cities like Belfast in Northern Ireland, Lima in Peru, Homs in Syria, and Nicosia in Cyprus, are physically divided. The same goes for borders between the United States and Mexico, North and South Korea, India and Pakistan, and Israel and its neighbors.\n\nIt's not a new phenomena, but according to Belen Desmaison, an architect researching one of the walls in Lima, Peru, it's part of a global trend. Using concrete, barbed wire, electric currents, or surveillance technology, these walls are built to divide people from different social or ethnic groups\n\nBut they don't necessarily work. Nick Buxton, a researcher at Transnational Institute, told the New York Times in January that people can build as many walls as they like, but it'll only make things more dangerous. \"People will find ways to cross walls,\" he said.\n\nHere are 16 walls dividing people around the world.", "description": "Cities and countries are divided by walls across the world, and they're becoming more common.
