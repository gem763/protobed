And she executed it perfectly.\n\nFirst, the Massachusetts senator expressed sorrow for the \u201charm I caused,\u201d referencing her attempt to prove she had Native American ancestry through a DNA test. Then she pivoted to her literal plan, her sweeping and detailed set of ideas to expand tribal nation sovereignty and invest in social programs benefiting Native American communities. The long list of proposals was repeatedly praised by the forum\u2019s attendees, several of whom excitedly predicted that they were speaking to the next president of the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile Warren\u2019s campaign staff might have breathed easier coming out of the forum, her Republican antagonists have made it clear they have no intention of forgetting the episode. Shortly before Warren\u2019s appearance at the forum, the Republican National Committee released an opposition research memo titled, \u201c1/1024th Native American, 100% Liar,\u201d which quoted its deputy chief of staff Mike Reed as saying, Warren \"lied about being [Native American] to gain minority status at a time when Ivy League law schools were desperate to add diversity to their ranks.\u201d A few days earlier, President Donald Trump, after lamenting that \u201cPocahontas is rising\u201d in the polls, assured his supporters at a New Hampshire rally that he still has the ability to derail her: \u201cI did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out. But that was too long ago. I should\u2019ve waited. But don\u2019t worry, we will revive it.\u201d\n\nHas Warren effectively addressed the controversy? In conversations I had with Democratic and Republican political strategists, unaffiliated with any presidential campaign, there was no bipartisan consensus. The Democrats believed Warren\u2019s rise in the polls is evidence she has weathered the storm. The Republicans argued Warren remains vulnerable to charges of dishonest opportunism.\n\nThey\u2019re both right. Warren is enjoying a comeback because she has convinced many skittish progressives that she won\u2019t let Trump disrupt her relentless focus on policy solutions. And she has convinced many Native American leaders that her policy proposals for indigenous communities are more important than what she has said in the past about her ancestry.\n\nBut because Warren\u2019s comeback has relied on restoring her standing on the left, she has not done anything to address concerns potentially percolating among swing voters. A detailed white paper on Native American policy has no bearing on whether a moderate white suburbanite believes Warren is of good character. And since Warren has apologized for her past claims, she remains open to the charge she was dishonest when, during her academic career, she relied on nothing more than family lore to identify herself as Native American.\n\nThat means if she becomes the Democratic nominee for president, Warren would still face a \u201cPocahontas\u201d problem, one that threatens the core of her candidacy.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s the nominee and says, \u2018Trump\u2019s dishonest,\u2019 that\u2019s just the immediate counter: You\u2019re dishonest about the most fundamental thing, who you were and how you got to your positions,\u201d said Republican strategist Chuck Warren of the political consulting firm September Group. He is of no relation to the candidate.\n\nDan Hazelwood, another Republican consultant and owner of Targeted Creative Communications, argued her apologies have missed the mark: \u201cShe\u2019s never given the answer to the core of the Trump charge, which is: She cheated. She cheated for personal gain. She hasn\u2019t answered that part of the attack.\u201d\n\nAn exhaustive Boston Globe investigation in September 2018 concluded Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u201cclaim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools.\" However, once she was hired, Harvard used her self-identification to help bolster its diversity statistics and tamp down criticism of its hiring practices. The Globe reported, \u201cWarren doesn\u2019t have a direct answer for whether her claims \u2026 might have harmed the efforts of others to press for more diversity at the overwhelmingly white institution.\u201d\n\nHowever, these Republicans don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s preferred rhetorical grenade\u2014the \u201cPocahontas\u201d slur\u2014poses the biggest threat to Warren. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Pocahontas thing sticks,\u201d Chuck Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny line to people at the rallies, [but] it doesn\u2019t talk much about her character. It almost makes the point trivial.\u201d\n\nWhat would be devastating to Elizabeth Warren is if Trump were able to connect the underlying concerns about her personal integrity to the integrity of her agenda. She styles herself as a warrior for the people, fighting to fix a system \u201crigged\u201d against them by elites. But if Trump can convince swing voters that Warren, as a member of the academic elite, rigged a system to benefit herself, he could turn what is now Warren\u2019s main strength into a fatal weakness.\n\nKey to making that connection is reducing her detailed plans to cheap pandering. \u201cEverybody loves to call her a policy wonk, but everything she is presenting is \u2018buy me a vote,'\u201d Chuck Warren said. \u201cShe is willing to say, or put on any hat, to get ahead.\u201d Hazelwood envisions Elizabeth Warren\u2019s platform being characterized as \u201cputting the government in charge of everything and giving away stuff for free. \u2026 And oh, by the way, the stuff that\u2019s going to be given away is going to be given away by cheaters.\u201d\n\nWarren can insist that she never won a job because of how she described her ethnicity. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from attacking her, and Democrats shouldn\u2019t assume the president\u2019s own record of dishonesty will protect her either. \u201cIf you give Trump a tool to equalize the playing field, which is what this does,\u201d Hazelwood said, \u201che will do exactly what he did to Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn several presidential elections, Democrats have seen Republican attack dogs disfigure their nominees beyond recognition by turning their strengths into weaknesses.\n\nIn 2016, Republicans turned Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of State, essential to her case that she was the most qualified for the job, into a deluge of conspiracy theories centered on her private email server. In 2004, Democratic voters thought John Kerry\u2019s war record would protect him from challenges to his patriotism, only to have his war record baselessly but effectively maligned by the \u201cSwift Boat Veterans for Truth.\u201d In 2000, Al Gore had a reputation as a Boy Scout, until George W. Bush's campaign used some of his minor flubs and sloppy phrasings to brand him as a \u201cserial exaggerator.\u201d\n\nBut when I talked to Democratic operatives who were part of some of these campaigns, and know all too well the potential dangers that lie ahead of any Democratic nominee, they praised Warren for how she, after her DNA test misstep, has seized control of her own narrative with her seemingly unlimited appetite for policy plans.\n\n\u201cWarren has successfully defined herself as a candidate, instead of letting others define her,\u201d said Peter Daou, a veteran of the Kerry campaign and the 2008 Clinton campaign. Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former spokesman for Clinton\u2019s 2016 effort, concurred, noting Democrats have \u201cstruggled\u201d during the Trump era to \u201cdrive our own message and not be entirely tethered to his.\"\n\n\"She\u2019s shown an ability to do that, and that allows you to navigate his nonsense but also drive your own point,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Democratic operatives are understandably impressed with Warren\u2019s rise. She is the only 2020 presidential candidate to have a rise. In the Real Clear Politics poll average, no other candidate has increased his or her share of the vote more than 0.5 percentage points since May 1. Warren\u2019s support has nearly doubled, from 8.4 percent to 15.4 percent. Since the first of the year, when Warren began the exploratory phase of her campaign at 4.3 percent, Warren\u2019s support has nearly quadrupled.\n\nBut Warren started 2019 scraping bottom in the polls, giving her more room to rise, because of the Native American controversy. In early 2018, Warren was scoring in the low double-digits in Democratic primary polling. But her numbers began to sag by the fall, and the obvious cause was Trump\u2019s repeated \u201cPocahontas\u201d jabs\u2014most prominently, his July \u201coffer\u201d of $1 million to her favorite charity if she proved her Native American ancestry with a DNA test.\n\nWhen Warren took him up on it in October, she made her problem worse. She had let Trump dictate the terms of their engagement. Her test results\u2014she had Native American ancestry 6 to 10 generations in the past\u2014did little to defuse the situation. She angered the Cherokee Nation, which rejects the whole concept of DNA to determine tribal heritage. Then in February, when the Washington Post uncovered that Warren self-identified as American Indian on her 1986 State Bar of Texas registration card, she shifted from proudly defending her family lore to sheepishly apologizing for \u201cfurthering confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship.\u201d Her prospects looked bleak.\n\nHer comeback began once she stopped talking about her ancestry and started talking about her plans. Progressive commentators, livid at mainstream media obsession with the Native American saga, as well as with speculation about her \u201clikability,\u201d pushed back by celebrating the substance and reach of her policy proposals. The Nation splashed her on a March cover declaring, \u201cElizabeth Warren isn\u2019t scared of Trump\u2014or her own party.\u201d In April, the feminist site Jezebel summed up her candidacy with the headline, \u201cElizabeth Warren Has a Plan.\u201d By May, it was Time magazine that had Warren on the cover with her common refrain, \u201cI Have a Plan for That.\u201d\n\nOn top of the pile of plans, many voters began to recognize Warren was much better on the stump than some had presumed, leading them to, well, like her. Before the Democratic debate in June, she was back in double-digits. The ancestry controversy went unmentioned in both summer debates. Warren otherwise avoided any serious attacks, and her numbers kept inching up.\n\nBut her rise has been propelled largely by the left flank of the Democratic Party. In one of her better poll showings, the August Quinnipiac University poll that placed her in second nationally with 21 percent, she won among \u201cvery liberal\u201d voters with 40 percent but was well behind Joe Biden among moderate and conservative voters with 11 percent. It\u2019s one thing to make uberprogressives forget about \u201cPocahontas\u201d with uberprogressive plans, but it\u2019s another to do the same with moderate swing voters.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhen I asked Democratic operatives whether Warren needs to do something different in order to connect with swing voters and inoculate herself against general election attempts to dredge up the ancestry controversy, they said no. They see in her existing campaign style and persona the ingredients for a favorable matchup against Trump.\n\nTracy Sefl, who handled Kerry\u2019s rapid response operation for the Democratic National Committee and also advised the 2008 Clinton effort, sees a \u201cpowerful contrast\u201d between Trump \u201cimpulsively shouting out these things and gleefully hurling slurs\u201d from \u201ca stage\u201d and Warren\u2019s \u201cfar more engaging and dignified\u201d approach in which she is \u201cliterally among voters,\u201d spending \u201chours worth of [time in] photo lines.\u201d Sefl also praised Warren\u2019s web strategy, creating a webpage\u2014elizabethwarren.com/pocahontas\u2014that tells the story of the real Pocahontas\u2019 abuse and early death to raise awareness of the high rate of violence against Native American women today, mostly perpetrated by nonnatives.\n\nFerguson didn\u2019t buy the Republican argument that Trump would be able to challenge Warren\u2019s honesty. \u201cIn 2016, he was seen as a straight talker,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cBut in three years as president, he\u2019s gone from straight talker to straight bullshit artist.\u201d Therefore, \u201cit\u2019s hard to see Donald Trump winning a debate with anyone about honesty and integrity.\u201d\n\nThese Democratic operatives are hardly naive about the potential power of Republican attacks. \u201cThe Republicans are excellent and skilled at taking [what] they can find in their opponents,\u201d Daou said, \u201cand hammer and hammer and hammer away at it, until it becomes a mainstream news story.\u201d\n\nYet he graded Warren as having \u201cpassed the test with flying colors\u2014the test of withstanding right-wing attacks.\u201d Ferguson further argued that the Native American controversy isn\u2019t like the Clinton email server episode. \u201cOne of the challenges of 2016 was the drip-drip-drip of the email news [and] the investigation news,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t drip-drip-drip. This is Trump beating a dead horse.\u201d\n\nBut Hazelwood contends the old tricks can still work to drive news. \u201cWe\u2019re all kidding ourselves if you [think Trump] can\u2019t find people who are going to stand up and say, \u2018I was wronged in this process\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a Native American and I think this is still inappropriate, and she never actually properly accounted for her misdeeds,\u201d Hazelwood said.\n\nMost Native Americans might be disinclined to continue criticizing Warren. Mark Trahant, the editor of Indian Country Today and the moderator of this month\u2019s Native American presidential forum, relayed to me via email that the forum\u2019s attendees \u201cgave her more than a warm reception.\"\n\n\"She had one of four standing ovations,\u201d he wrote, and attendees were \u201cfar more interested in the candidate\u2019s policy proposals\u201d than the ancestry controversy. But, he also noted, \u201cThere are a number of people that will consider Elizabeth Warren\u2019s actions and the DNA test egregious and will never come around.\u201d\n\nIn fact, four days after the forum, Rebecca Nagle, a Cherokee Nation member and the host of the \u201cThis Land\u201d podcast produced by the progressive Crooked Media, published a devastating essay in HuffPost. Nagle argued Warren\u2019s apology was insufficient because her 19th-century and early 20th-century ancestors were white people who occupied Cherokee land with military force and through broken treaties. \u201cWarren\u2019s ancestors replaced the truth of their complicity in Cherokee dispossession with a tale of being Cherokee,\u201d Nagle wrote. In her view, Warren can only make things right by stating she \u201cdoes not have a Cherokee ancestor and that she was wrong to claim one.\u201d\n\nNagle has no interest in helping Trump. She responded to Warren supporters on Twitter writing, \u201cWarren isn\u2019t running against Trump, she\u2019s running against\u201d the Democratic field. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s silly to think not talking about this issue will make it go away. Ppl who want Warren to be prez should press her to resolve this issue now.\u201d But even if Nagle and most Native Americans wouldn\u2019t publicly side with Trump in a general election against Warren, Hazelwood warns Democrats to \u201cnot pretend that you can\u2019t find those people, because a presidential campaign can.\u201d\n\nWhether Warren has the skills to overcome the expected attacks can only be proved in real time, and perhaps Democrats should be thankful that, as Sefl observes, Trump is so impulsive. If Warren continues to rise in the polls and becomes the front-runner, Trump won\u2019t be able resist early engagement. In preparation for that likely confrontation, Warren might want to consider how the last successful Democratic nominee survived a major controversy during a primary.\n\nBarack Obama, in March 2008, had to answer for anti-American sermons delivered by his pastor Jeremiah Wright. Obama\u2019s response, the famous \u201cA More Perfect Union\u201d address, was not solely aimed at Democratic primary voters. He delivered a broader discussion of race relations designed to unify all Americans by encouraging a deeper understanding of coarse sentiments harbored by blacks and whites. This not only helped Obama connect with swing voters for the general election, it also helped soothe nervous Democrats who wanted to know if he could handle whatever Republicans threw at him. Warren, in contrast, has yet to tailor a message for swing voters, betting that the ambitious populism that progressives love will also resonate with voters outside of the Democratic primary electorate.\n\nThe Democratic operatives I spoke with may well be correct that Warren can survive any Republican-manufactured storms by simply being Warren\u2014strong, substantive and on message. That presumes the DNA debacle was an anomalous case of Warren failing to be Warren. Yet it\u2019s risky to assume the Republican operatives are wrong. If her reputation among swing voters gets poisoned by accusations of dishonesty, she will find that extremely hard to remedy, and as before, might respond to pressure by making matters worse.\n\nTo avoid that pitfall, she should invest energy now in defining herself as \u201chonest.\u201d Without direct mention of the past controversy, she could collect testimonials from her professional past vouching for her integrity and promote them in ads and on the trail. That way, when attacks on her integrity are launched in full force, she will have already fortified her defenses\u2014and in a way that is not reliant on political ideology.\n\n\u201cIt is risky business to look backwards for the answers to what\u2019s ahead,\u201d Sefl told me, cautioning against the assumption that what worked for Republicans in the past was destined to work again. It\u2019s true that Warren is a different candidate than Clinton or Kerry. And Trump\u2019s weakened political standing as an embattled incumbent might mean he can\u2019t easily run on his playbook from 2016. No two campaigns are the same.\n\nBut it\u2019s a simple fact that the Native American controversy did once damage Warren\u2019s presidential aspirations and that her recovery has yet to reach most moderate voters. If she has a plan for reaching them before Trump does, we haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nThis article tagged under: 2020", "description": "Sure, she calmed nervous progressives.
