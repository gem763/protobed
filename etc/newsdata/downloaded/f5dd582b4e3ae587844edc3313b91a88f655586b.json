A Christian cross was put up at the service, which several Muslims also attended.\n\nThe funeral was for Goeltom\u2019s wife\u2019s relative, who recently passed away. The family was not able to hold the funeral in their own home, where a narrow alleyway outside the house was their only option.\n\nThe mosque postponed its weekly Quran study for the funeral, Kompas reported.\n\n\u201cThank you my brothers, the caretakers of the mosque, and the residents of the neighborhood for the assistance and the super high level of tolerance,\u201d Goeltom wrote.\n\nHis post went viral, with close to 40,000 reactions, over 11,000 comments, and 10,000 shares as of this posting. Indonesian netizens also praised the mosque and both religious communities.\n\n\u201cPeace is beautiful. That\u2019s the real Indonesia,\u201d wrote one user in Bahasa. \u201cThis is my Indonesia, praise the Lord,\u201d wrote another.\n\nReligion is a fundamental part of life for most people in Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country. A survey, conducted by the Varkey Foundation spoke to 20,000 Indonesians born between 1995 and 2001 and found that 93 percent of respondents believe religion is the most important way to choose happiness.\n\nThe viral post came as a glimmer of hope amid what the Jakarta Post has described as a \u201cdeep crisis of intolerance\u201d in Indonesia. Discrimination and incidents of religious bias have swept the country recently.\n\nJakarta, in particular, has been named the least tolerant city in Indonesia in a list of 94.\n\nThe country\u2019s \u201creligious harmony law\u201d which was intended to increase tolerance, has also been criticised for further marginalising minorities. Enacted in 2006, the law mandates that the construction of places of worship must be approved by a majority of a community's population. This has resulted in the construction of some churches and mosques being prevented.\n\nIndonesia is home to the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, with about 87.2 percent of the country identifying as such. Seven percent are Protestant Christian, 2.9 percent are Catholic, 1.7 percent are Hindu, and 0.7 percent are Buddhist.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "The scene went viral, giving people hope that different faiths can support each other despite recent incidents of intolerance.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "David Gilbert", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6cea5a5a70b600098d0fef/lede/1567420629606-mosque-christian-service-jakarta-090219.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7491xh;0xw,0.037xh&resize=1200:*"}
