Roman, chief executive of the Partnership for a Healthier America. \u201cVending is the nut that hasn\u2019t been cracked, but when you work with a sector-wide group you can move quickly.\u201d\n\nVending machine foods are disproportionately consumed by middle- and low-income Americans, Roman says. And because vending machine options frequently are shelf-stable foods, they tend to pull for high-sugar, high-salt, highly processed snacks and sugary beverages.\n\nBut Roman says the industry is aware that tastes are changing.\n\n\u201cThe entire population would like to eat better food products \u2014 truck drivers want a chance to eat better food, millennials and Gen Z are leading the way. It\u2019s the vending industry positioning itself for tomorrow\u2019s consumers. It will make a meaningful change in the food culture and drive shifts in food production.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNAMA chief executive Carla Balakgie sees this next initiative as part of something that started in 2005 when the industry put in place a labeling program to identify \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d products. NAMA defines \u201cbetter for you\u201d as a food or beverage that meets at least two of the healthy food standards established by Partnership for a Healthier America, Center for Science in the Public Interest, American Heart Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or USDA\u2019s Smart Snacks.\n\nThe Partnership for a Healthier America will retain outside auditors to verify vending machine changes, says Roman.\n\nThe new healthier options will replace sugar-based beverages with water and non-sugary beverages, and will include apples and bananas, fresh food prepared in USDA-certified kitchens, baked (not fried) chips, string cheese, nuts, dried fruits and sealed sandwiches, according to Josh Rosenberg, the former chief executive of Accent Foods in Pflugerville, Tex.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccent Foods operates 21,000 vending machines, 1,300 \u201cmicro-markets\u201d (unattended convenience stores) and 4,000 pantry services operations. Rosenberg\u2019s company moves 750,000 individual food and beverage units each day, in places like the House and Senate, the Smithsonian Institution, and Johns Hopkins Healthcare.\n\nSome of this push is because of innovations in equipment. Shelf-weighted, sensor-based coolers allow customers to walk up and swipe a credit card, opening the cooler, and through sensors and cameras the equipment determines what you bought and charges you accordingly. The operator is sent real-time restocking information electronically without anyone having to be on-site.\n\n\u201cTech has allowed us to reach beyond our boundaries,\u201d Rosenberg says. \u201cThis is about investing in new technology, retrofitting existing equipment and product changes in existing equipment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVending machines, Balakgie says, are one of the lowest price-point parts of the food industry, so it\u2019s important to maintain a range of options to avoid pricing out low-income people.\n\nFor Rosenberg, this shift is an opportunity to compete with the world\u2019s advanced vending machine countries.\n\n\u201cWe want to become Japan in unattended retail,\u201d he says.\n\nThat said, he doesn\u2019t think the honey bun is going away anytime soon.\n\nAD", "description": "Vending machine operators say they will boost their share of string cheese, low-sugar bars, dried fruit and nuts, ensuring that one-third of their offerings are healthier.", "authors": ["Laura Reiley", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Food"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MBcqmWZTy7I1kHJG79DR9tnJE2o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MIJN5QWTEEI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
