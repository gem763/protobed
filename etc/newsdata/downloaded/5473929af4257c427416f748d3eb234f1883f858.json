He was convicted in 1998 of assaulting Margaret Moore, who was left with black eyes after he hit her 20 times.\n\nBoycott, who has always denied the offence, said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t give a toss\u201d about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood, and cast doubt on the credibility of French justice.\n\nBut after being tracked down by the Guardian in Alsace, Dominique Haumant, who presided over trial, said she did not believe Boycott\u2019s denial and that his conduct during the court case had been \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe he\u2019s being received by the Queen,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder. Now that I\u2019m really shocked at. He doesn\u2019t deserve it.\n\n\u201cAs far as French justice is concerned, he has been found guilty of having beaten his partner three times.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominique Haumant, the trial judge: \u2018If I didn\u2019t think he was guilty I wouldn\u2019t have convicted him.\u2019 Photograph: Handout\n\nThe retired judge said: \u201cI remember this case very well and I remember the row about it even after 20 years. I saw all the photos, the evidence, the statements and if I didn\u2019t think he was guilty I wouldn\u2019t have convicted him.\u201d\n\nBoycott was fined \u00a35,300 and given a three-month suspended jail sentence, upheld by a second court on appeal. He was also ordered to pay a symbolic one franc in compensation to Moore.\n\nThe 78-year-old former England captain, who has been commentating for Channel 5 and BBC Radio 5 Live during this summer\u2019s Ashes series, has always denied the charges and claimed Moore was a \u201cwoman scorned\u201d exacting her revenge.\n\n\u201cBoycott was most definitely not a gentleman,\u201d Haumant said. \u201cHe told one of the opposing lawyers to shut up during the hearing. That was extremely vulgar and not something you say during a hearing. I can\u2019t imagine a judge in your country allowing that, and I wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nThe judge, who retired in 2009, said she had not been convinced by Boycott\u2019s story. \u201cHis version was that Madame Moore had fallen on the carpet. I definitely remember it was carpet [not marble] because I remarked that she didn\u2019t get two black eyes from falling on the thick carpet of a luxury hotel.\n\n\u201cHe claimed it was an accident, but, as I say, if I convicted him it was because I thought he was guilty and I stand by that. He appealed and my judgment was upheld by the appeal court.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret Moore in court with photos of the injuries she suffered.

He was arrogant and he had a deplorable attitude throughout the trial.\u201d\n\nAfter he was convicted in the court in Grasse, on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, Boycott took a swipe at the French judge, saying he was not entirely surprised to be found guilty \u201cin view of the way the trial was conducted\u201d. He claimed that unlike the UK, the legal system in France rested on the principle of \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d.\n\nIn a BBC interview following his knighthood, Boycott repeated the claims. \u201cIt\u2019s a court case in France where you\u2019re guilty, which is one of the reasons I [didn\u2019t] vote to remain in Europe, because you\u2019re guilty until you\u2019re proved innocent. That\u2019s totally the opposite from England and it\u2019s very difficult to prove you\u2019re innocent in another country and another language.\u201d\n\nHe said he did not care about condemnation of his honour from a leading domestic violence charity. Responding to Adina Claire, the co-acting chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, who described his knighthood as part of former prime minister Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list as \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d, Boycott told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Martha Kearney: \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cTwenty-five years ago, love, in a French court, she [Moore] tried to blackmail me for \u00a31m. I said no, because in England if you pay any money at all, we think: \u2018Hang on, there must be something there.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not paying anything\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d actually got a million at the time.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:20 Geoffrey Boycott rejects criticism of his knighthood \u2013 audio\n\nThe French legal system, like the British, is based on the principle that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. All but the most serious crimes and offences, those carrying a prison sentence of 10 years or more, are tried without a jury.\n\nPeople are not \u201ccharged\u201d with a crime or offence in France, they are \u201cput under investigation\u201d. Before the case comes to trial, an investigating magistrate known as a juge d\u2019instruction tells police to collect evidence and takes witness statements to produce a case file to determine whether an offence has been committed.\n\nIf the magistrate decides there is no charge to answer, the case is class\u00e9, or dropped. If the magistrate decides there is a case to answer, the person is sent to trial and the file, available to the lawyers of all interested parties, is presented to the trial judge.\n\nThere were three hearings in the Moore v Boycott case. He was first convicted of assault in January 1998 by judge Marc Juando at a court in Grasse. He was not present for the hearing and appealed successfully to have the verdict set aside.\n\nHaumant presided over a second trial in Grasse in November 1998 that confirmed the verdict of the first. Boycott appealed and a panel of three judges upheld the conviction in May 2000.\n\nThe November 1998 trial was long and at times chaotic. Boycott was said to have flown 13 witnesses to the south of France at an estimated cost of more than \u00a3200,000, but many appeared to have nothing to say directly about the accusations. They included a psychiatrist who had never met Moore but gave his interpretation of her behaviour from television clips and conversations with her former husband.\n\nHaumant remembers sitting until the early hours of the morning hearing witnesses, many of them appearing for Boycott, all of whose testimony had to be translated. \u201cIt was a long trial, but then there were a lot of witnesses, most of them for the defendant,\u201d she said.\n\nThe verdict in January had been set aside because Boycott failed to turn up to the brief hearing, explaining he was on tour commentating on Test matches in South Africa.\n\nBoycott and Moore were staying at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes in October 1996 when they argued. Moore was reported to have become even more furious when she returned to their hotel room to find Boycott packing for an early flight back to the UK.\n\nHe claimed she had slipped in the ensuing fracas while throwing his clothing and belongings out of the window.\n\nMoore said he had attacked her, holding her to the ground and staring at her with \u201cwild, piercing and manic\u201d eyes as he hit her.\n\nIn her seven-page written explanation of her verdict, Haumant, who told British journalists covering the trial that her hero was the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, made it clear she was not impressed with Boycott\u2019s behaviour in or out of court.\n\n\u201cIn the court, the accused didn\u2019t hesitate to interrupt Mrs Moore\u2019s lawyer rudely, tarnishing the image of the perfect gentleman which he brought his old friends and witnesses to testify to,\u201d she wrote at the time. She said the evidence presented to the court \u201cdoes not support the theory of an accidental fall\u201d and ruled that Moore had been the victim of \u201cpurposeful blows\u201d.\n\nBoycott accused Moore of blackmailing him to settle for a large sum of money, but she said it was never about cash. She asked for and was awarded the symbolic one franc damages. Boycott, labelled a woman-beater and criminal, found it difficult to shake off the stain on his reputation, even when Moore\u2019s former solicitor Sue Sims-Steward said Moore saw Boycott as a way of solving financial problems and portrayed the victim as a difficult woman who could \u201cturn on the tears at will\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to me that he\u2019s been given an honour,\u201d said Haumant. \u201cI remember reading a profile of Theresa May in the French magazine l\u2019Express when she said her great idol was not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, but Geoffrey Boycott.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand it is surprising because of what he did,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was heavily criticised for my judgment to the point I worried that I\u2019d better not go to the UK because I wouldn\u2019t be safe in the street. I remember an article that made fun of me for not knowing anything about cricket, but why would I?\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Boycott did not comment.", "description": "\u2018I cannot believe he\u2019s being received by the Queen,\u2019 says French judge", "authors": ["Kim Willsher", "Simon Murphy", "Matthew Engel", "Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c84534d56d2e9bed9974674d7bb54e1c83f71a/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9dfdd3d24e5b3cb35cc2c1c405515b53", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
