Our boys don't give up, though. It was a tough physical game and we kept plugging away.\n\n\"Tactically, France were really smart in the way they played today. I'm proud of the boys because other teams may have capitulated but we didn't and we are here for another couple of weeks.\"\n\nThe French will be furious that they allowed themselves to be forced onto the defensive, having played superbly for most of the opening 50 minutes.\n\nThe perennial question of \"which France will turn up?\" was answered emphatically as they roared into a 12-0 lead after eight minutes, playing with pace, dynamism and total commitment.\n\nVahaamahina bundled over for the first score before Damian Penaud set up the second by beating Liam Williams in an aerial duel \u2013 which very few people can manage \u2013 to set his backline moving and eventually sent flanker Charles Ollivon over.\n\nWales had barely swung a punch but got on the scoreboard when Wainwright scooped up a dropped ball to gallop between the posts for his first international try.\n\nWales, who suffered a blow pre-match when star center Jonathan Davies was ruled out through injury, then lost another key man in number eight Josh Navidi.\n\nThe first contribution of his replacement Moriarty was a high tackle that sent him straight back off again for 10 minutes in the sin-bin.\n\nFrance duly took advantage with their third try as Penaud managed to unload a diving pass out of the tackle to Virimi Vakatawa, and the unstoppable center proved just that.\n\nThe halftime score of 19-10 was extremely kind to Wales and every player in both camps would have been well aware that earlier this year France led 16-0 at halftime in Paris but lost 24-19 as Wales completed the biggest comeback in Six Nations history.\n\nSomething similar then began to look likely when Vahaamahina turned from hero to villain as he was shown a red card after ludicrously smashing his elbow into the face of Wainwright in a maul on the Welsh line.\n\nFrance responded by buckling down and showing real aggression in defense, giving up just one Biggar penalty in the next 25 minutes.\n\nBut just as it looked as if they might hold out for a memorable victory, replacement scrum half Tomos Williams stripped the ball from French hands after a five-meter scrum and Moriarty, villain turned hero, more than made up for his earlier yellow by grabbing it and diving over.\n\nAfter a long TMO check, the try was confirmed. Biggar converted and Wales controlled the remaining minutes to record their eighth win in the teams' last nine meetings - and by far the most important.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Wales advanced to their third World Cup semifinal when Ross Moriarty's dramatic late try gave then a 20-19 victory over a battling France team who played the last half-hour with 14 men after lock Sebastien Vahaamahina was sent off on Sunday.
