I mean, FFS.\u2019\n\nDan fired back, retweeting his comment and calling Piers out for \u2018picking on\u2019 the duchess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Imagine being given a TV show & a newspaper column & using them both to pick on a woman who didn\u2019t want to go out for a second drink with you,\u2019 he said.\n\nPiers, who has repeatedly accused Meghan of ghosting him, clarified the situation with a string of putdowns: \u2018Imagine being the dullest, most excruciatingly virtue-signalling, tediously opinion-devoid, toe-curlingly snivelling sycophant on TV?\n\n\u2018Ps For the record, I never asked Meghan for a drink, she asked me.\u2019\n\nNot wanting to leave it there, the BBC Breakfast host shot back: \u2018Imagine losing the plot (and the argument) to the \u201cdullest, most excruciatingly virtue-signalling, tediously opinion-devoid, toe-curlingly snivelling sycophant on TV\u201d\u2018 adding a thumbs up and cry-laughing face emojis, along with the jokey hashtag #TearsForPiers.\n\n\u2018Mate, the only thing I lose when jousting with you is the will to live,\u2019 Piers said.\n\nAs ever, Piers\u2019 co-host Susanna Reid calmly stepped in with the point that everything highlighted in the programme was worth hearing about.\n\nShe said: \u2018Most of it was about the charity work they do. Hugely important. It was also an insight into their personal state of mind. Also important.\u2019\n\nMeghan Markle has spoken about how tough it is being a new mum in the spotlight (Picture: Getty)\n\nEarlier this year Piers has congratulated Meghan on being a \u2018top social climber\u2019, accused her of behaving \u2018like a Kardashian\u2019, and advised her to \u2018go back to America\u2019 if she wants privacy.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
