Aeronautics segment in Fort Worth, Texas, for production lots 12, 13, and 14 of the F-35's third-generation helmet-mounted displays for the U.S. military services.\n\nThis advanced helmet-mounted display comes from a joint venture between Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and in and Elbit Systems of America in Fort Worth, Texas. It serves as the pilot\u2019s primary display system.\n\nIt blends head-up display (HUD), helmet-mounted display, and visor-projected night vision to enable pilots to target their weapons and maintain advanced spatial orientation while continually monitoring critical flight information. The F-35 is the first tactical fighter jet in 50 years without a traditional HUD.\n\nRelated: F-35 air-to-air missiles can now hit two unmanned aircraft at once -- changing air combat\n\nVirtual capabilities of the helmet enables the pilot virtually to see through the bottom of the F-35's fuselage or directly at a target to experience extreme spatial orientation, superior weapons targeting, and tactical superiority during the day and at night. At the same time, the pilot has an uninterrupted display of flight information and sensor data.\n\nThe helmet offers bi-ocular, 30-by-40-degree field-of-view. For night missions, it projects directly onto the pilot's visor to eliminate the need for separate night-vision goggles aboard the combat jet.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "More than just another weapon.", "authors": ["Military", "Aerospace Electronics"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X6G3Zb0U6Jt4b87P5YdlpQ--~B/aD0xMDQwO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/999153d071aaab48ecc6d78feecb8f2a", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
