After being sidelined by an injured flexor near his right elbow, Hicks pinch hit for starting left fielder Cameron Maybin in Game 2 on Sunday night and grounded out leading off the 10th inning, then moved to center.\n\nLimited by injuries to 18 games during the regular season, Stanton homered in the opener and missed Game 2 because of a strained right quadriceps.\n\n\u201cOutfield is the biggest question,\u201d Stanton said during batting practice. \u201cI can hit. I need to move around more and let\u2019s see what I got.\u201d\n\nManager Aaron Boone said Stanton probably would be on the injured list if this were the regular season.\n\n\u201cKind of called G in right when he got here and just said we\u2019re going to stay away today,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get outside and move around a little bit more today \u2014 feel like he would be a hitter-off-the-bench option today. And then we\u2019ll kind of see where we are again moving forward kind of day by day here.\u201d\n\nRain is forecast for Wednesday, which could push back Game 4 to Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at least a little bit of an unknown and something that we\u2019re kind of working through day by day,\u201d Boone said, \u201ctrying to make good medical evaluations, strength, see how he\u2019s doing out there, try and have real frank conversations with G, as well.\u201d\n\nBrett Gardner moved from center and replaced Stanton in left. Asked what he expected from Hicks, Boone said \u201ca couple homers, walk\u201d and smiled.\n\n\u201cThe big question mark is, he hasn\u2019t played in a couple of months, so that\u2019s the challenge,\u201d Boone said.\n\nFirst baseman DJ LeMahieu was leading off, followed by right fielder Aaron Judge, Gardner in left, designated hitter Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, second baseman Gleyber Torres, shortstop Didi Gregorius, catcher Gary S\u00e1nchez, third baseman Gio Urshela and Hicks in center. Luis Severino was on the mound.\n\nHouston moved George Springer from right to center, inserted Josh Reddick in right, benched Jake Marisnick and started catcher Mart\u00edn Maldonado in place of Robinson Chirinos.\n\nSpringer was leading off, followed by second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve, left fielder Michael Brantley, third baseman Alex Bregman, first baseman Yuli Gurriel, DH Yordan \u00c1lvarez, shortstop Carlos Correa, Reddick and Maldonado.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Aaron Hicks returned to the New York Yankees' starting lineup on Tuesday for the first time since Aug. 3 and Giancarlo Stanton remained", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/162549_alcs-astros-yankees-baseball-00255-new-york-yankees-left-fielder-giancarlo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
