Instead, the central bank used a lot of aggressive forward guidance and large scale asset purchases.\n\n\"If we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound, again not something we are expecting, then I think we would look at using large scale asset purchases and forward guidance,\" Powell added.\n\n\"We feel that they worked fairly well,\" said Powell. \"We did not use negative rates.\"\n\nPowell's sentiment contrasts with many central bankers around the world. More than $17 trillion worth of government bonds trade at negative yields, as monetary policymakers scramble to react to a slowing economy.\n\nEconomists have debated whether the U.S. could get sucked into the global trend if weakness persists, but Powell clarified the Fed would not be taking that approach if the economy continues to slow.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been vocal about wanting the Fed to get U.S. interest rates closer to the current global standard.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt,\" Trump tweeted earlier this month.\n\nBefore the news conference Wednesday, the central bank approved a quarter-point interest rate cut.\n\nThe FOMC announced that it would take down its benchmark overnight lending rate to a target range of 1.75% to 2%. That comes nearly two months after the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee went ahead with its first cut since the financial crisis.", "description": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he does not see the Fed using negative interest rates in the future.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106051907-1564602782607gettyimages-1158909188r.jpg?v=1568826319"}
