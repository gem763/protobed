As the commercial space industry booms, the botched launches illustrate another complication the industry will have to figure out: how to clean up the trail of pollution it leaves behind.\n\nThe rockets quickly came down where they launched at the Pacific Spaceport Complex. That\u2019s where Astra Space, a relatively new venture that also goes by the name Stealth Space Company, held its first attempts at a suborbital launch in 2018, and both failed, New Scientist reported on September 30th. Astra Space didn\u2019t respond to The Verge\u2019s requests for an interview.\n\nFuel spills like those on Kodiak Island will probably kill plants, animals, and even bacteria and nematodes in the soil. Even successful launches can spread heavy metals across the surrounding land. If left untreated, pollutants can build up in the bodies of animals and leach into groundwater where it could pose risks to people, too. Reviving places doused in fuel and heavy metals from rockets can take immense amounts of time, energy, and money. But it\u2019s increasingly necessary as more rockets head into the sky.\n\npollutants can build up in the bodies of animals and leach into groundwater\n\n\u201cIf you have a large spill of something like refined kerosene, it\u2019s going to have a pretty strong impact on all the biological systems,\u201d Lee Newman, an associate professor at the State University of New York\u2019s College of Environment Science and Forestry, tells The Verge.\n\nAlaska Aerospace Corporation hired a contracted soil remediation company and worked with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation to come up with a plan for cleaning up the refined kerosene spill on site. It ultimately decided that the most prudent way to take care of the problem and prevent further harm was to get the soil off site and send it to Anchorage for treatment. Digging up and hauling the dirty soil away can sometimes be the quickest way to clean up the area and prevent contamination from spreading, experts say.\n\n\u201cSometimes rockets don\u2019t perform as everyone fully expects,\u201d Mark Lester, president & CEO of the Alaska Aerospace Corporation, which owns and operates the spaceport, says of the Astra launch failures. \u201cThis demonstrates the space community, the spaceport\u2019s responsibility to get after taking care of the environment when things go awry.\u201d\n\nAs the commercial space industry grows, it may need to speed forward with methods of protecting the communities and environment around its launches, too. In the past, according to Lester, the facility only averaged one launch a year. But he says it could soon be hitting the facility\u2019s maximum of nine a year. And with more launch sites, like Spaceport Camden in Georgia and the Virgin Galactic spaceport in New Mexico, popping up across remote parts of the US, spills that need to be tidied up could mushroom, too.\n\nTo deal with the contamination in Alaska, New Scientist reports that the dirty soil at Pacific Spaceport was heated up to nearly 600 degrees Fahrenheit in order to vaporize residual hydrocarbons. Then, a thermal oxidizer, which is commonly used for air pollution control, broke down the resulting gases with heat reaching almost 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit, which is about the temperature it takes to melt bronze.\n\n\u201cyou\u2019re not going to be able to get anything growing in it again.\u201d\n\nTreating the soil with such high temperatures burns off the fuel, but it doesn\u2019t revive the soil. The structure of the soil has been altered, and any living organisms in it have been killed. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take it back and dump it in the spot where you dug it up from because you\u2019re not going to be able to get anything growing in it again,\u201d Newman says. Most of the time, treated soil gets sent to the landfill.\n\nLester says that the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska did consider another option: using plants and microbes in the soil to break down large chain hydrocarbon molecules in kerosene. This option \u2014 called phytoremediation when used with plants and bioremediation with microbes \u2014 takes much longer, and Lester says that, ultimately, the climate on Kodiak Island wasn\u2019t ideal for this method. But experts say it can be a good way of actually repairing the environment, especially at the edges of a spill where the concentration of pollution isn\u2019t as high. \u201cYou\u2019re reclaiming the ecosystem, because you\u2019re using native plants whenever possible to try to nourish the bacteria that are doing the breakdown there. So we\u2019ve got lower costs, less side effect impacts, and you\u2019re preserving the ecology,\u201d Newman says.\n\nOther spaceports have already put these biology-based interventions to work. NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida sits in the middle of a national wildlife refuge. Unlike the unspent fuel that spilled as a result of the Astra crash landings, most launches leave behind a trail of heavy metals like iron and manganese.\n\nSome plants used in phytoremediation, like ryegrass, readily absorb the heavy metals that can be left behind by rockets. That\u2019s important since it may not be so good for animals and other wildlife. In 2014, one researcher found that alligators near Kennedy Space Center had higher levels of heavy metals in their livers. \u201cThese are plants that are able to take high levels of heavy metals without apparently being affected adversely. Such plants may not die. As a matter of fact, they may just thrive,\u201d says Olayinka Nwachukwu a soil scientist at the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Nigeria.\n\nTo date, the space agency tells The Verge that it\u2019s remediated 12,754 tons of soil at Kennedy Space Center, some of which was done through bioremediation. NASA has also put systems in place that use pressurized air to treat groundwater pollution.\n\nThere is a lot to conserve on the public land that surrounds these launch sites, which is why cleaning up after launches will continue to be an important issue as the space industry grows. According to the Space Center\u2019s website, the refuge around Kennedy is home to some of the highest numbers of threatened and endangered species in the US, including the West Indian manatee and wood stork. Kodiak Island, where the Pacific Spaceport Complex sits, is called the \u201cemerald isle\u201d for its lush greenery. The Alaskan island is a surprising destination for surfers, and it\u2019s home to a sub-species of brown bears that have been isolated on the island for the last 1,200 years. \u201cThere\u2019s no palm trees but it\u2019s very green, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Lester tells The Verge. \u201cPeople pick berries on the spaceport.\u201d", "description": "As the commercial space industry booms, botched launches illustrate another complication the industry will have to figure out: how to clean up the trail of pollution it leaves behind.", "authors": ["Justine Calma", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l15EDbTonmFWnxjcJJ5n6ajdEbM=/0x275:3000x1846/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19286072/1142090017.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
