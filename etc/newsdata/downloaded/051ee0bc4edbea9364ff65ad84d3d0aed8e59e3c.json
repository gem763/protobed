Dr Ayo Ajeigbe received the patient at his private practice in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital, in his customary welcoming manner.\n\nBut there was, it turned out, nothing wrong with the man. And when Ajeigbe asked why he was there, he simply replied: \u201cI just wanted to see what a psychologist looked like.\u201d\n\nPerhaps he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. Mental health professionals are rare in Nigeria, as they are in many other developing nations. In Africa\u2019s most populous nation \u2013 a country of more than 200 million people \u2013 there are an estimated 150 practising psychologists.\n\nMind over natter: the English town with a big mental health plan Read more\n\nIf mental health treatments are patchy, inadequate and underfunded in most western nations, they are practically nonexistent in the majority of lower- and middle-income countries \u2013 more than 100 countries worldwide. Here mental health provisions are the poorly resourced afterthought of health budgets that are in any case likely to be meagre.\n\nSo what is to be done? Ajeigbe decided that a partial answer lay in the voluntary sector. A year ago, he agreed to head up the Abuja section of Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (Mani), a burgeoning user-led organisation fast emerging as a multi-pronged solution to Nigeria\u2019s mental health crisis.\n\nMani was launched in 2016 by Victor Ugo, a then medical student from Lagos who had suffered from depression, as a response to the lack of mental health support in Nigeria, where an estimated 7 million people have the same condition.\n\nUgo\u2019s vision was to drive change by raising awareness and dispelling stigmas that exist around mental health issues in Nigeria. And on Wednesday, he will appear at the annual Goalkeepers event on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, to make the case for more funding and fairer treatment for mental health.\n\n\u201cIf you have depression,\u201d says Latifah Yusuf Ojomo, the deputy head of Mani\u2019s Lagos team, \u201cpeople can cast you as mad, which means that the majority of people who have mental health issues in Nigeria do not understand, or want to accept what they are feeling.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, Ugo decided that if Mani was to have any significant impact it would need to focus attention on the country\u2019s most populous demographic. \u201cYoung people [in Nigeria] are much more open to learning new things,\u201d explains Ugo, \u201cthey are much more focused on ways to change.\u201d\n\nMani needed a \u201ccool factor\u201d, something Ugo says was sorely lacking in the mental health sector: \u201cSymposiums, that was all that was happening with mental health in Nigeria, just more and more symposiums, people would give a lecture saying we need to increase awareness, but nothing was happening.\u201d\n\nUgo and a small band of medical students took to social media, sharing stories and launching online campaigns. Then in October 2017 they hosted their first event, not a symposium as Ugo is keen to point out, but a food fair: \u201cWe just said come and you can taste different delicacies, play games and talk about mental health in a cool way.\u201d\n\nThe event was a huge success, and evolved into a series of monthly workshops focused on topics such as depression and anxiety. As Mani continued to grow in numbers, these meet-ups became known as \u201cconversation cafes\u201d, held in restaurants, parks and cafes, and eventually spreading to cities all over Nigeria, including Abuja and Ibadan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mani now conducts workshops in schools in Lagos. Photograph: Mani\n\nEach month, a different topic is selected \u2013 childhood trauma, the benefits of mindfulness, relationship strains, the reactionary attitudes of the \u201cvillage\u201d \u2013 a case study is presented and discussion groups form.\n\nTwo years later, Mani is now a leading voice on mental health issues in the country, with more than 1,500 volunteers and active in 13 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states. Ugo is still taken aback by what the project has achieved. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know we were going to end up here; in fact, I feel like we have been a hundred times more successful than we expected at the start.\u201d\n\nDespite the initial success, Ugo knew that still more needed to be done. \u201cWe thought if we don\u2019t balance this with some kind of help, we will cause more harm than good.\u201d So, in 2017, Mani launched a 24-hour mental health support service to run alongside its awareness campaigns. The service allowed people to reach out over WhatsApp or Twitter for emergency help in the form of advice, counselling and supportive listening. An emergency response team was also created via a network of volunteer counsellors. Mani also launched a confidential 24-hour suicide hotline. Attempted suicide is a criminal offence in Nigeria, punishable by up to one year in prison.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside?

It also leaves Mani with a limited pool of professionals to recruit. As a solution to this, Mani launched a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d system in which mental health professionals educate volunteers in subjects such as active assistance and safe talk (a programme that teaches participants to recognise and engage individuals who may be a suicide risk). Ajeigbe explains: \u201cWhat we do is train people in fundamental mental health skills, so if I train 10 people, they can in turn reach 100 people.\u201d\n\nMani\u2019s volunteers come from a diverse range of backgrounds. Alle Ayodele, the head of the organisation\u2019s Oyo state chapter, was studying microbiology when he decided to volunteer for Mani after coming across its support team on Twitter. He had been impressed by its speed and professionalism in responding to a series of suicide notes that were trending: \u201cMani took them really seriously, as soon as someone posted a note they stepped in.\u201d\n\nEkene Okeke, from Lagos, has a background in sociology and criminology. After suffering from depression and connecting with Mani on Twitter, she decided to volunteer for it. Okeke was recently called out on an emergency where a woman had high levels of anxiety and had been alone for several days. \u201cI dropped what I was doing, and spent hours talking with her, I even went and bought her ice-cream.\u201d It\u2019s moments like this, Okeke says, that make volunteering so rewarding: \u201cIn the end, the woman was able to calm down and has since reached out for help.\u201d\n\nThe female bakers healing rifts in Central African Republic Read more\n\nInformal mental health support networks like this are becoming more prevalent around the world, as people realise that health systems cannot cope with mental illness, and that society will have to come up with other strategies. Examples include park bench psychotherapy in Zimbabwe, a peer-support initiative in Kenya, community-based self-help in Pakistan and the Phola organisation in South Africa.\n\nIn Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest city, Mani has launched a training programme for schools. The programme will include a series of \u201cmental health clubs\u201d where students are taught about coping mechanisms, the effects of bullying and consent workshops. Mani also trains teachers and parents on children\u2019s mental health, the latter a group that Ugo identifies as especially crucial. \u201cCulturally, young people are not allowed to speak up,\u201d explains Ugo, \u201cyou have to listen; respect is really crucial. If I need help, I ask my parents and they decide if I need help.\u201d\n\nWhen Mani\u2019s WhatsApp service began in 2017 it immediately identified an issue. \u201cMany more females seek help than men,\u201d Ajeigbe explains, \u201cthis is because according to societal norms men are supposed to be emotionally strong.\u201d About 85% of the initial calls were from women, so Ugo and his team researched how their service could appeal more to men. \u201cWe read that men are much better at using test-based services,\u201d says Ugo, who immediately incorporated a test into the programme. This resulted in a 40% increase in men reaching out.\n\nRecruitment of volunteers is one area where Mani does not need to worry \u2013 it currently has 500 applications waiting to be processed. \u201cThe good thing is that many people who talk to us end up volunteering for us,\u201d says Ugo. More than 10,000 people have now spoken with Mani using its WhatsApp service.\n\nThe success of Mani may have exceeded Ugo\u2019s initial expectations, but he is not one for complacency. He has now set his sights on persuading the government to change the national policy on mental health. He is also seeking a broader funding base, as 90% of the costs of the organisation are borne by the founders.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we are still very much self-funded, Ugo says. \u201cThis is a big challenge, considering how much more impact we believe we can make, and the speed with which we are growing our network across Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Mani can be contacted at contact@mentallyaware.org and on +234 805 1493163\n\n\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
