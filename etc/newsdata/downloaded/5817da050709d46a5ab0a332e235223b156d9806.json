The Redskins failed to reach either of those averages Sunday, with just 220 yards in a 33-7 loss, and McCoy\u2019s performance left the team with more questions as to how it would move forward at the quarterback position.\n\n\u201cTough day. I don\u2019t want to paint any other picture,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cI felt fine physically. But when you get down a couple scores to these guys, it\u2019s a hard thing to just drop back and throw with their pass rush and their defense.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAwful on field and directionless off, it\u2019s time for Redskins to face a hard reality\n\nWashington\u2019s offense never got going against the defending Super Bowl champs. The Redskins were 1 for 11 on third down, fumbled three times and threw an interception. McCoy finished 18 for 27 for 119 yards with a 60.6 passer rating in his first game action since he broke his leg last season and underwent multiple surgeries. He also was sacked six times.\n\n\u201cHe rushed a couple things there early in the game and rightfully so,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cHad some trouble picking up some stunts, which we have practiced and worked against all week, all year. It\u2019s an unfair evaluation right now; have to check out the protections first. He handled things pretty well, I think, but we have to do a better job around him.\u201d\n\nThe results put the quarterback position back into limbo for the Redskins. At 0-5, the team is staring at a potential lost season, and there have been calls for Washington to start planning about the future by making rookie first-round pick Dwayne Haskins the full-time starter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Haskins looked overwhelmed in his pro debut last week against the New York Giants, which is partially what led Gruden to start McCoy this week. Gruden\u2019s fondness for McCoy is well known, and McCoy appeared set to win the starting job coming out of training camp before the setback to his leg. Gruden could decide to ride McCoy the rest of the season \u2014 or at least for the next few games \u2014 given that Haskins has not proved he\u2019s ready to be a starting NFL quarterback. There\u2019s also Case Keenum, who was inactive Sunday after starting the first four games of the season and is dealing with a foot injury.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 quarterback situation, a question mark for much of training camp and for the last couple of weeks, figures to remain an issue heading into Sunday\u2019s game at the Miami Dolphins.\n\nDefense shows signs of life\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 defense arguably had its best showing of the season, which is a tough thing to say considering it allowed 33 points. But against Brady and one of the most productive offenses in the league, the Redskins held the Patriots to just 12 points in the first half, forcing three punts and a turnover on downs. The defense finally got pressure on an opposing quarterback, recording four sacks after having five in the first four games.\n\nThings fell apart in the second half as the offense sputtered and the defense grew tired. New England scored touchdowns on three of its first four possessions of the second half. Washington\u2019s defense was on the field for over nine minutes in the third quarter.\n\nEven Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 how many Patriots fans were at FedEx Field\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this performance is something the defense can build upon, particularly heading into a stretch of the schedule that should be easier than the team\u2019s first five weeks. That starts Sunday against the winless Dolphins. In the immediate aftermath of the loss, however, frustration remained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt sucks for everybody right now,\u201d defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said. \u201cSucks for Coach Gruden, [defensive coordinator Greg] Manusky. Literally everybody here is going through it. But at the end of the day, no one cares about that. No one cares about your feelings, coaches\u2019 feelings or my feelings. We have to get it done.\u201d\n\nSims flashes big-play potential\n\nUndrafted rookie Steven Sims Jr. has become a multifaceted weapon for the Redskins, and the team\u2019s efforts to get him more touches paid off in the first quarter, when he rushed for a 65-yard touchdown that would be the team\u2019s lone score of the game. Sims took the misdirection carry, broke two tackles and ran away from the rest of New England\u2019s defenders down the sideline.\n\nAD\n\nWhile that play gave Washington an early lead and much-needed energy, he showed his inexperience late in the second quarter. On a first-and-10 play with 58 seconds remaining, Sims broke off a slant route too early, leading to Jason McCourty\u2019s interception off McCoy. That set up Mike Nugent\u2019s 23-yard field goal that gave the Patriots a 12-7 halftime lead.\n\nRead more:\n\nRedskins drop to 0-5 after ugly home loss to Patriots, as pressure mounts for Jay Gruden\n\nPatriots\u2019 offense \u2018can be a lot better,\u2019 Tom Brady says after big win over Redskins\n\nThe key moments from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to the Patriots\n\nSteelers quarterback Mason Rudolph knocked out, hospitalized after scary hit\n\nNorman Chad: Upon further review, the call stands: Replay stinks\n\nAD", "description": "Washington's quarterback situation remains a question mark after a poor performance by Colt McCoy.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ejQDBu0FWz9s7b1Wkpefnpoa0EI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6453C6HIQMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
