You hate sweet, earnest pop for the same reason you hate Bake Off, and dogs. You think the vocoder-ish solo here sounds like Bon Jovi, and only drunken idiots like Bon Jovi. As you straddle your BMW M3 across two parking spaces at South Mimms Services, adorable, major-key heartbreak ditties from the ex-singer of Chairlift feel beneath you. You\u2019re ... the worst. Oh, actually, I definitely am saying you\u2019re a bad person if you hate this.\n\nDiplo x Jonas Brothers\n\nLonely\n\nConsidering that, three months ago, Joe Jonas accused Diplo \u2013 truly the fetid bowling shoe of producers \u2013 of ruining his wedding by livestreaming it without permission, it is a surprise to see them collaborate, if not successfully, then at least so soon. The result is exactly what you expect: sort of Lilt-R&B, but without any of the merits of either. It will make them all lots of cash. Ah, to be a celebrity!\n\nDanny Brown\n\nBest Life\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t no next life, so now I\u2019m tryna live my best life\u201d isn\u2019t a lyrical couplet that\u2019s going to cause the ghost of Leonard Cohen to drop its fag, but the sentiment is a fine one, and Brown \u2013 who has toned down the nasal honkage somewhat \u2013 delivers it like a bear hug sprawled over a Q-Tip masterclass in hip-hop production, all scuzzy lounge-funk and Eastern-flecked violin motifs. It\u2019s thrillingly excellent. And short. Not enough songs are short.\n\nAlicia Keys ft Miguel\n\nShow Me Love\n\nI actually cannot think of anything to say about this. It is slow, edgeless, acoustic gloop. AK and M say \u201cshow me love\u201d a lot. I think they mean sex. It has a nice video with rain in it. It\u2019s just finished and I\u2019ve forgotten how it goes already. It\u2019s like hearing the taste of lettuce.\n\nStereophonics\n\nBust This Town\n\nIf you can name a single Stereophonics song since Dakota you are either a) A member of the rock band Stereophonics, b) A Radio X DJ, or c) One of those people who remembers everything \u2013 what they ate on the 21 June 2008, every phone number they\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 until, finally, their mind snaps like a dry twig. For 15 years, the \u2019Phonics have insisted on ploughing this plodding, hookless, dadrock furrow until all goodwill from those two brilliant albums from 20 years ago has plugholed like hot wee. Is this song better than anything they\u2019ve released since 2004? No idea. Might be. Is it better than picking an orifice \u2013 any orifice \u2013 and feeding a sea urchin into it? No it is not.", "description": "This week we\u2019ve got an 80s pop-soaked banger, some deadly dull dadrock, and an awful Lilt-R&B style collab", "authors": ["Luke Holland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b213938607102ac1a82f5713b38a0a93524a5bc3/0_0_4492_2695/master/4492.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b877e622ea0e9e4cded1cb9873c8dfc", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
