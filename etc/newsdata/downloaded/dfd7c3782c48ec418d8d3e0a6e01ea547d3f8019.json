REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo\n\nMILAN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) does not expect the shift in production toward electric cars aimed at averting billions of euros in European pollution fines to hurt its profit margins, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said in a newspaper report on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect a deterioration in margins. Our advantage is that all our brands have the same platform for electric products and the same batteries that we buy in China,\u201d Diess said in an interview with daily la Repubblica\u2019s Monday supplement A&F.\n\nDiess said the German car maker expected to sell nearly 20,000 Audi e-Tron in 2019, adding the first year\u2019s production of the electric Porsche Taycan was already sold out.\n\nOrders for the VW ID.3, the group\u2019s recently unveiled compact electric model, are already covering the production planned until mid-2020, Diess said.\n\nLast month at Frankfurt auto show Germany\u2019s premium automakers marketed electric cars as their flagship models to lure customers away from gas-guzzling SUVs.\n\nDiess said he was concerned by the trade war between the United States and China, which was already causing a fall in Volkswagen\u2019s Chinese sales even if its market share in the country had been growing in the past six months, reaching 19%.\n\nIn any case, Volkswagen does not plan to cut its exposure to the Chinese market, Diess said.", "description": "Volkswagen does not expect the shift in production toward electric cars aimed at averting billions of euros in European pollution fines to hurt its profit margins, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said in a newspaper report on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440625734&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0HD", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
