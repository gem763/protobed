LSE\u2019s rejection is a sign that Hong Kong cannot break away from the mainland and develop on its own without the support of a China brimming with opportunities, according to the piece.

They spiked to 20pc up early this morning when Asian markets opened, which was the first chance traders had to react to the attacks over the weekend.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Rick Perry has joined the voices pinning the attack directly upon Iran, calling them \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\nDespite the sabre-rattling in Washington, OANDA\u2019s Edward Moya writes:\n\nIt will take a lot to disrupt the bull case for US stocks and the today\u2019s selloff that stemmed from the Saudi oil field attacks could see buyers eventually re-emerge. The possibility of a US military escalation remains a key risk but that is probably not going to happen. President Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election bid cannot stomach a war and we should not be surprised if we continue to hear tough talk, and possibly further escalations in the Persian Gulf, with maybe a couple US coordinated air strikes that will look to avoid any loss of life. With the Fed likely to deliver a few more rate cuts and with the recent progress in the trade war, we should see limited downward pressure with US equities. Oil stocks could have a nice couple of days, while airline and cruise line stocks could see some pain.

She writes:\n\nMusic retailers have found it tough over the years to stay afloat because of high costs, a fall in sales and the rise of download and then streaming services that have made CDs obsolete. Putman nevertheless is optimistic. Last week he unveiled plans for the so-called Vault, a cavernous shop in Birmingham, previously home to furniture seller Ikea. It is so big that when it will open its doors next month, it should be one of Europe\u2019s largest entertainment stores, if not the largest, with tens of thousands of titles and live gigs on the cards.\n\nDoes the HMV dog have a another day in it?

On Sunday, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters that Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, but that Aramco may have to cut exports later if the outage in output continued for long.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to measure what the long-term disruption of the Abqaiq attack will be, but this is how the numbers look currently (complete with useful preamble, courtesy of Wood Mackenzie\u2019s Ed Crooks):\n\nA good chart showing the history of oil supply disruptions, from @JavierBlas and colleagues at Bloomberg pic.twitter.com/AfNKDqOrvv \u2014 Ed Crooks (@Ed_Crooks) September 16, 2019\n\n10:27AM\n\nOil price holds steady around 9pc up\n\nThe price of oil, which registered its biggest intraday spike ever (about 20pc) as Asian markets opened in the wee hours of this morning, is now up around 9pc.\n\nThat has left the price at around $66 a barrel, which is where it stood in mid-July.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering August was a tough month for the black liquid, as trade war wobbles raised fears of slowing demand.\n\n10:12AM\n\nAvon Rubber bounces forward with revenues expectations holding\n\nAvon Rubber supplies tactical equipment to police and military forces Credit: Christopher Jones More\n\nContinuing what has been an unusually military-heavy blog, Avon Rubber has posted a trading statement ahead of its twelve-month results, saying it expects revenues to grow by 4pc for the full year.\n\nThe firm, which supplies tactical equipment to police and military forces, said it had experienced a \u201cstrong\u201d year, with successful aircrew mask deliveries to the US Department of Defence a highlight.\n\nIt said strong law-enforcement performance had also bolstered its numbers.\n\nPaul McDonald, its chief executive. said:\n\nWe are on track to deliver a strong set of results in what has been a transformational year for Avon Rubber.\n\nJefferies analysts said:\n\nWe retain our positive stance on Avon.

We promised 2019 would be a year of stabilisation with revenue growth, continued quality improvement, cash generation and net debt reduction. All have been achieved in H1, with good operating profit performance. We saw growth in both private insurance and self-pay, with a particularly strong result in private insurance reflecting rising consumer awareness following our marketing campaigns\n\nLiberum analysts said:\n\nWhile today's update was very welcome given its patchy track record of earnings delivery, we still require more confidence that the market backdrop has stabilised before turning positive.\n\n9:11AM\n\nUBS: Attacks puts the heat back on over Iran\n\nThere had been hopes that Donald Trump\u2019s firing on national security adviser John Bolton (right) would ease tensions over Iran Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America More\n\nUBS analysts say the weekend\u2019s events blow up any sense that relations between Washington, Riyadh and Tehran would soon settle. They write:\n\nIf nothing else a reassessment of risk pricing will likely presumably come in the aftermath of this attack. To take out over 5pc of global supply (in the country with the bulk of \u2018spare capacity\u2019) in a single strike \u2014 a volume exceeding cumulative non-OPEC supply growth over 2014-2018 \u2014 is highly worrying.

Predictably, energy firms Tullow Oil and Premier Oil are among the biggest risers.\n\n8:34AM\n\nReaction and analysis: \u2018traders may be a little on edge for a while\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of the reaction to this morning\u2019s oil price move.\n\nMarkets.com\u2019s Neil Wilson said:\n\nThis is a big escalation in terms of the scale and reach of these attacks so raises prospect of ongoing disruption and raises the geopolitical danger. It\u2019s going to add a massive risk premium to crude prices, so it will likely materially drive prices higher for a while. The big uncertainties right now for crude are 1) the extent of the outage, 2) how does this escalate, and 3) could there be more attacks of this kind. What is certain is the genie is out of the bottle in terms of risk premium. The implications of these attacks are far-reaching and lasting, going well beyond the immediate disruption to albeit a very large portion of global output. It is a material escalation in the risks to supply and, in short, traders now worry that Saudi Arabian oil production can be swiftly and easily knocked out, which goes against everything we\u2019ve come to expect for the last 50 years. Saudi Arabia is supposed to be the reliable lynchpin, able to ramp production at will. It indicates ongoing destabilization to global energy markets and will raise very real concerns about the Aramco IPO.\n\nBiggest losers are oil consumers (and SJP|) pic.twitter.com/7O2EBXKjF1 \u2014 Garry White (@GarryWhite) September 16, 2019\n\nJefferies\u2019 Jason Gammel said:\n\nIf the Iranians have been driven to desperate measures from the loss of crude export revenues, an attack on Saudi capacity seems a likely response. The risk of wider conflict in the regions, including a Saudi or US response, will likely raise the political risk premium on crude prices by $5-10/bbl.\n\nIn a worst case scenario that resulted in a shutdown of oil transport through the Straits of Hormuz, oil prices could push through $100/bbl. We think this outcome is highly unlikely however, not least because important Iranian allies like the Chinese would be hit hard.\n\nSaudi Riyal 12mth forwards set for biggest move since 2015 after attack of oil facility.

Saudi Arabia believes a significant proportion of the outages can be back online in a few days while Trump also approved release of supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure the market remains well surprised. None of this should make us feel relaxed about the potential for further attacks though and the longer-term implications on the oil market. Spikes in oil prices when the global economy is already flirting with the idea of recession is not ideal and, if repeated and sustained, could ultimately be what tips us over the edge. While oil prices have pared gains following the initial knee-jerk reaction to the reports, Brent and WTI remain around 10pc higher as the geopolitical risk premium keeps prices elevated. This may settle down if attacks are not repeated but traders may be a little on edge for a while, keeping oil trading at a premium for some time.\n\n8:26AM\n\nEuropean stocks sink as oil attacks undercut rally\n\nWith markets finally getting a chance to react to the weekend\u2019s oil attack shock, European equities are sliding slightly, losing some of the momentum they were building at the end of last week.\n\nCredit: Bloomberg TV More\n\n7:56AM\n\nChinese data adds to market gloom\n\nIt\u2019s not just oil prices causing consternation.\n\nMSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4pc, Reuters reports, after data showed China's industrial production growth unexpectedly fell to its weakest pace in 17.5 years in August.\n\nPainting a dour picture of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, China\u2019s statistics bureau said the country faces increasing downward pressure from external uncertainties.\n\nChina's blue-chip index eased 0.5pc, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index faltered about 1pc, despite expectations Beijing will soon announce more support measures.\n\nLiquidity was relatively thin with Japanese markets shut for a public holiday.\n\n7:41AM\n\n\u2018Biggest one-day move ever\u2019\n\nSmoke is seen following a fire at an Aramco factory in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday Credit: REUTERS More\n\nState energy producer Saudi Aramco lost about 5.7m barrels per day of output in Saturday\u2019s attack after 10 unmanned aerial vehicles struck the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing facility in Abqaiq and the kingdom\u2019s second-biggest oil field in Khurais.\n\nFor oil markets, it was the single worst sudden disruption ever, surpassing the loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi petroleum supply in August 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded his neighbour. It also exceeded the loss of Iranian oil output in 1979 during the Islamic Revolution, according to data from the US Department of Energy.\n\nIn an extraordinary start to trading on Monday, London\u2019s Brent futures leapt almost $12 in the seconds after the open, the most in dollar terms since they were launched in 1988. Prices have since pulled back about half of that initial surge of almost 20pc, but were still heading for the biggest advance in more than three years.\n\nSaudi Arabia can restart a significant volume of the halted oil production within days, but needs weeks to restore full output capacity, people familiar with the matter said. The kingdom \u2014 or its customers \u2014 may use stockpiles to keep oil supplies flowing in the short term.\n\nAramco could consider declaring itself unable to fulfill contracts on some international shipments \u2013 known as force majeure \u2013 if the resumption of full capacity at Abqaiq takes weeks.\n\nThat would rattle oil markets and cast a shadow on Aramco\u2019s preparations for what could be the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering. It\u2019s also set to escalate a showdown pitting Saudi Arabia and the US against Iran, which backs proxy groups from Yemen to Syria and Lebanon.\n\n7:37AM\n\nTrump: US is \u2018locked and loaded\u2019\n\nDonald Trump tweeted yesterday promising to respond to the drone attack on Saudi Arabia:\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked.
