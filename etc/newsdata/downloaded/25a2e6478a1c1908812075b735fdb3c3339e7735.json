Congress has also made clear that aliens should 'not depend on public resources to meet their needs,'\" the White House said.\n\nThe judge's ruling came four days before the rule was set to go into effect.", "description": "The White House on Friday night blasted a federal judge's ruling\u00a0temporarily\u00a0blocking the Trump ad", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/whitehouse_032219gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
