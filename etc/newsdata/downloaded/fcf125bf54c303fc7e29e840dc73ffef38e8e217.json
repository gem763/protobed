Additionally, sources told Deadspin that network executives are closely watching how the controversy is discussed on their air waves.\n\nESPN has gone back and forth on how to cover stories where both sports and politics collide. Back in 2018, ESPN\u2019s president Jimmy Pitaro said ESPN should be covering the \u201cintersection between sports and politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you tune into ESPN, we should be, we need to be covering those stories, if there is a connection to sports,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pitaro appeared to change his stance in May, telling The Los Angeles Times, \u201cour data tells us our fans do not want us to cover politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy job is to provide clarity. I really believe that some of our talent was confused on what was expected of them. If you fast-forward to today, I don\u2019t believe they are confused,\u201d he said.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended Mr. Morey Tuesday, saying the league is not apologizing for Mr. Morey because he \u201cenjoys that right\u201d of freedom of speech.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
