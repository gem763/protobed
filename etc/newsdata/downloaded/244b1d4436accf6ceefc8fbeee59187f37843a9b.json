Within hours, research showed that some of the same Democrats stampeding toward microphones to excoriate Trump used the term to describe criticism against other Democrats in the past. That includes, especially, the impeachment of Bill Clinton, as the Washington Post noted late yesterday.\n\nThe oddest apology came from Joe Biden, however, who wants everyone to know that, er \u2026 he had no idea what this meant when he said it? Just to make this context clear, here was Biden in 1998 describing the Republican \u201clynching\u201d of Clinton via the constitutional process after Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice in a deposition:\n\nWhile Biden has called Trump\u2019s lynching comments \u201cabhorrent\u201d and \u201cdespicable,\u201d in 1998 appearance on CNN, Biden said impeachment could end up being viewed as a \u201cpartisan lynching.\u201d https://t.co/4jGo8hSQSZhttps://t.co/6p210g7M6l pic.twitter.com/UkJiXLsHOG \u2014 andrew kaczynski\ud83e\udd14 (@KFILE) October 22, 2019\n\nBIDEN: It seems to me that the process is being demeaned. And I have great faith in Henry Hyde, but \u2018ol Henry better get on the job. Because unless he figures out how to corral this, no matter what happens, even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching, or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense.\n\nDoes that sound like a word choice in the heat of the moment, or a well-crafted if emotionally charged argument? It was an attempt to play a race card on House Republicans, part of a pattern that Biden has created over the years. Few Republicans will forget Biden\u2019s claim that Mitt Romney would \u201cput y\u2019all back in chains\u201d in 2012\u2019s presidential election. The Boston Globe, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought, ripped Biden for his attempt to play a race card at that time and offered a thought experiment that has turned out to be prescient:\n\nWhen Vice President Joe Biden warned a Virginia rally of hundreds of African Americans that Republican efforts to loosen bank regulations meant \u201cThey\u2019re going to put y\u2019all back in chains,\u201d Stephanie Cutter, Team Obama\u2019s deputy campaign manager, said the president would have \u201cno problem with those comments.\u201d But imagine if Republican Paul Ryan uttered comments like that. Mitt Romney\u2019s pick for vice president would be pilloried for racial insensitivity \u2014 and so would Romney. In the fight for civility and substance over pointless hyperbole, Biden may not be the worst offender. But he\u2019s an offender nonetheless, and he should apologize.\n\nKeep that in mind as we get to Joe\u2019s 22-years-too-late apology. Biden argues that Trump\u2019s use was different because \u201che chose his words deliberately,\u201d implying that the word \u201clynching\u201d just flew out of his own mouth on its own volition in 1998:\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that. Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily. https://t.co/mHfFC8HluZ \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 23, 2019\n\nThis is utter nonsense. The video itself shows Biden also deliberately choosing the word \u201clynching.\u201d He didn\u2019t stumble over it or use it out of context. It was the climax of a series of conditions in his argument to conclude that Republicans were an out-of-control mob that its leadership had failed to \u201ccorral\u201d and that a lynching would be the result. It\u2019s impossible to argue that Biden didn\u2019t deliberately craft that argument around the concept of lynching itself, on purpose.\n\nWhat about the Boston Globe\u2019s thought experiment? The Washington Post\u2019s Amber Phillips fulfills its prophecy this morning, attempting to excuse Democrats\u2019 use of the word while condemning Trump. Why? Phillips\u2019 excuses are (a) \u201cwe\u2019re more culturally aware now,\u201d (b) \u201cthe media landscape is different from the \u201990s,\u201d and (c) \u2026 orange man bad:\n\nTrump said it: This is the big one for a few reasons. One is that Trump is president of the United States, so his words carry more weight than those of a member of Congress. He\u2019s also white, and the majority of lynching victims were black. For the most powerful (white) person in the world right now to compare his plight of an impeachment inquiry, where lawmakers are following very real evidence, to the gruesome, death-by-torture mob mentality that claimed the lives of thousands of powerless black men was especially dissonant. It was Trump\u2019s extreme victimhood on display, and it\u2019s possible he truly believes he has been wronged on a par with lynching victims, writes The Fix\u2019s Eugene Scott. But perhaps the most notable reason Trump\u2019s lynching comments drew a major outcry was because the president no longer gets the benefit of the doubt that he is innocently using offensive language. He has a history of making racially inflammatory and even outright racist statements. Demonizing people of color and stereotyping black communities have been part of his campaign since day one. He also has a well-documented lack of empathy for people who are struggling. Combine those things, and it\u2019s hard to believe that Trump did not mean to draw a direct contrast between what\u2019s happening to him now and the real lynchings of the 19th and 20th centuries. Especially when one of his top supporters in Congress, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), clarified that for Trump, this is \u201ca lynching in every sense of the word.\u201d\n\nThese are distinctions, not differences. Biden may not have been president in 1998, but he was the Senate Judiciary chair and a major political figure serving as the president\u2019s proxy on CNN, for crying out loud. The media landscape has changed since the 1990s, but that has diminished CNN as a platform; it had a much more prominent place in the media firmament than after the explosion of online news sources that followed a few years later. The claim that \u201cwe\u2019re more culturally aware now\u201d is an absurdly arrogant claim; enlightenment did not jusy drop upon us as a gift from the Class of 2008. Everyone understood what lynching meant in 1998 too, and Biden used it for that reason.\n\nThis is nothing but an excuse for using double standards when it comes to Trump. His tweet was dumb and overwrought, yes, but so was the shrieking and hair-pulling that followed, much of which was directly hypocritical \u2014 perhaps no more so than with Joe \u201cPut Y\u2019all Back in Chains\u201d Biden.", "description": "Hypocrites.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/biden-1998-lynching.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
