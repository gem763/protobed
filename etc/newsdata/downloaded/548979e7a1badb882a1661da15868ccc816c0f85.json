Katie Hill offers up interesting defense following allegations of sexual relationships with 20-something female staffer and finance director", "language": "en", "text": "Recently, freshman Democratic Rep. Katie Hill found herself in a bit of a sticky situation after RedState reported that she and her estranged husband were involved in a relationship with one of Hill\u2019s 20-something female staffers and that Hill was also having an extramarital affair with her legislative director.\n\nCA Rep. Katie Hill Allegedly Involved Female Staffer in 2-Yr \u201cThrouple\u201d Relationship\n\nhttps://t.co/p9lRxIuCSr \u2014 RedState (@RedState) October 18, 2019\n\nMore from RedState:\n\nPhotographs and text messages obtained by RedState show that Rep. Hill was involved in a long-term sexual relationship with a female campaign staffer. The woman, whose name is not being released, was hired by Hill in late 2017 and quickly became involved in a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with Hill and her estranged husband, Kenny Heslep. \u2026 According to a source close to the staffer, the throuple agreed to continue their committed relationship when Hill moved to Washington, D.C. on January 2019, but that Heslep and the staffer quickly noticed a difference in Hill\u2019s demeanor. By late May, Hill broke off her relationships with both Heslep and the staffer, claiming she wanted to focus on \u201cthis important work\u201d and that it wasn\u2019t fair to be involved in a relationship. The staffer, as these text messages show, was distraught and trying to figure out how to move on with her life. \u2026 According to the text messages reviewed, after Hill left the throuple Heslep was told \u201cby numerous sources\u201d that Hill had been involved in a sexual relationship for a year with her then-finance director, now Legislative Director, Graham Kelly. In a post on his now-deleted Facebook account, Heslep posted a screenshot of a text message between himself and a friend of the couple in which the friend admits that he now knows about the Hill/Kelly affair.\n\nIt\u2019s taken Hill a few days to get her bearings, and this is apparently what she\u2019s going with:\n\nRep. Katie Hill reached out Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer personally to deny improper relationship w/ her staffer. In statement, Hill says she's going through divorce from \"abusive husband\" who is \"determined to try to humiliate me.\" W @BresPoliticohttps://t.co/DAXW9xMWo6 \u2014 Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) October 22, 2019\n\nHill also acknowledges nude photo of her that was published on a conservative website w/o her consent: \"I have notified Capitol Hill police who are investigating the situation and potential legal violations of those who posted and distributed the photos.\" \u2014 Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) October 22, 2019\n\n\"This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed,\u201d Hill continued. \u201cI, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\" \u2014 Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) October 22, 2019\n\nHmmm.\n\nUmmm\u2026.there are photos \u2014 TJ (@TJ27209483) October 22, 2019\n\nCombing a staffer\u2019s hair while nude is very normal \u2014 Dr. Richard Harambe (@Richard_Harambe) October 22, 2019\n\nHill was sleeping with someone she employs in her official office and is trying to turn her ethics violation into her being attacked https://t.co/dK20L1yOEo \u2014 Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) October 22, 2019\n\nGP \"There's nothing wrong with being buck nekkid behind an employee 10-15 years your junior who is dependent on you for her livelihood while styling her hair.\" Good defense. https://t.co/yB3vAFlXkg \u2014 The Gormogons (@Gormogons) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cAll the text and photo evidence isn\u2019t real\u201d lmao \u2014 rebel millennial (@patriotic_giant) October 22, 2019\n\nHill\u2019s chosen defense certainly leaves some things to be desired.\n\nKatie Hill denies extramarital relationship with her male congressional staffer, but apparently doesn't deny extramarital relationship with her female campaign staffer https://t.co/wg5Lq6YoQz \u2014 Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) October 22, 2019\n\nI wonder how a married politician's affair with a young staffer would be covered if the politician were, say, Dan Crenshaw \u2014 Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) October 22, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ve got a pretty good idea.\n\nLook at Politico's dishonest and hackish lede pretending she denies the whole allegation\u2026while the body confirms that she slept with the campaign staffer. This is peak hack. pic.twitter.com/ikbs8DiTgM \u2014 Andrew Follett (@AndrewCFollett) October 22, 2019\n\nSHOT: Republican Congressman forced from office over leaked photo CHASER: Journos providing cover when it happens to a Dem (who has the woman on her *congressional payroll*) pic.twitter.com/BtYAfxyeNn \u2014 Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) October 22, 2019\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated with additional tweets.", "description": "katie hill", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Pm On October", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/katie-hill_AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
