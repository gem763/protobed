Your favourite moments from Friends", "language": "en", "text": "\u2018Are you secretly married to any more of us?\u2019\n\nThe aftermath of the Vegas wedding (and Ross not arranging the promised annulment) produced some of my favourite Chandler lines: \u201cI couldn\u2019t face the idea of another failed marriage\u201d \u201cWell. Can I ask at what stage you considered this to be a successful marriage?\u201d and: \u201cRoss, just for my own peace of mind, are you secretly married to any more of us?\u201d mattyjj\n\n\u2018Did someone call for the looong arm of the law?\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The One Where the Stripper Cries. Photograph: NBC/Getty Images\n\nI love the one where Danny DeVito played the male stripper. Any time I hear the Soft Cell version of Tainted Love, I always picture DeVito in the policeman uniform. \u201cDid someone call for the looong arm of the law?\u201d DeVito seems like a good sport for taking the part. FrancoBegbieJnr\n\n\u2018It\u2019s classic Matthew Perry physical comedy\u2019\n\nThe one where the neighbour Mr Heckles dies and Chandler sees a foreshadowing of his own lonely future. The realisation comes when Chandler hears the noisy girls upstairs and whacks the ceiling with Heckles\u2019 broom, then looks at it and throws it aghast to the floor like it\u2019s on fire. I love that bit; it\u2019s classic Matthew Perry physical comedy. He was brilliant. And it had the melancholy that American comedy does so well. The last scene of Chandler alone in the empty room, turning the light off, was very human, which is why we loved it. And you did \u2026 even if you pretended you didn\u2019t. colin_robinson\n\n\u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve lost the will to scold\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The One With The Rumor. Photograph: NBC/Getty Images\n\nThe one where Brad Pitt comes to Thanksgiving and tells everyone he started the I hate Rachel Green club in high school. Chandler breaks Monica\u2019s special dinner plates and the day\u2019s been so disastrous she says: \u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve lost the will to scold.\u201d Northernsoulgirl\n\n\u2018Ross has the best episodes hands down\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The One with the Holiday Armadillo. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nFor me, the single funniest moment of the entire thing is Chandler\u2019s crazy roommate\u2019s goldfish cracker. Also, Ross \u2013 he\u2019s undoubtedly a weirdo and a bit of a creep, which is what makes him the best character in the show. Chandler has the best quips, but in terms of plot-based humour, Ross has the best episodes hands down. I mean, holiday armadillo! diibii\n\n\u2018Princess Consuela Banana Hammock and Crap Bag\u2019\n\nI remember laughing so much the first time I watched The Baby on the Bus episode. And I like the episode where Phoebe and Mike (Paul Rudd) are donating and un-donating money to charity \u2013 and when they change their names to Princess Consuela Banana Hammock and Crap Bag. ID027179\n\n\u2018This and Frasier on a Friday night were a great start to the weekend\u2019\n\nBest single shot? The bit where it looks like Joey is mournfully looking through a rain splattered window and missing Chandler, then the camera pulls back and he is actually looking through a piece of \u2018art\u2019 he bought in some post Chandler-moving-out shopping spree. It was pretty much always great. This and Frasier on a Friday night were a great start to the weekend. Good days. arcaneenchanter\n\n\u2018Pivot!\u2019\n\n\u201cPivot! Pivot! PIVAAAAAATTTTT\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, shut up, shut up!\u201d Melissa McDonald\n\n\u2018How many espressos have you had?\u2019 \u2018A million?\u2019\n\nThe One Where No One\u2019s Ready is my favourite. All six characters come in and out of Monica\u2019s apartment, driving three storylines of varying frivolity. It\u2019s a lesson in how to write a simple and perfect sitcom episode that doesn\u2019t go anywhere and doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nPhoebe: \u201cHow many of those [espressos] have you had?\u201d\n\nChandler: \u201cI dunno \u2013 a MILLION?!\u201d\n\nOne of my favourite lines.
