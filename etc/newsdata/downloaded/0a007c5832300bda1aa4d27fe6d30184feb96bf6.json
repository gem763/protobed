Its clean and classic main house is flanked on either side by bright pink structures. On one side is a more traditional Portuguese dwelling, which the home\u2019s agent, Kerstin Buechner, describes as \"a very Algarvian country house style.\"\n\nIt was restored and \"authentically renovated\" as a guesthouse when the main house was built. On the other side of the main house is a Moroccan-themed enclosed courtyard, its bright facade inspired by the cheerful guesthouse.\n\nThe two houses are detached and enjoy separate gardens, kitchens and dining areas, while subtle and tasteful Moroccan touches unify the interior atmosphere of the two dwellings.\n\nMore: Portugal\u2019s Tech Startups Have Revved Up Lisbon\u2019s Real Estate\n\nStats\n\nThis 10,118-square-foot home has five bedrooms and six bathrooms between its two structures. The main house has three bedrooms and four bathrooms, while the guesthouse has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The property sits on 1.4 acres of land.\n\nAmenities\n\nThe most stunning feature of this home is its 18-meter infinity pool that extends from its beautifully landscaped Algarvian gardens up to a covered patio. The gardens are complete with automatic irrigation, while the home has air conditioning, both essentials in the Portuguese heat.\n\nIn addition to a steam room and gym, the home boasts a soundproof cinema/music room with a small wine cellar and a novelty candy kiosk, both of which are located right outside the cinema door.\n\nMore: \u2018Golden Visa\u2019 Driving Lisbon\u2019s Luxury Real Estate Boom\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nThe rural hilltop area of Palmeiral where the villa is located might better be known, according to Ms. Buechner, as \"the hills beside Loule,\" which she describes as \"a little like Tuscany, with lots of cypress trees and winding little roads.\" The area benefits from gorgeous views down the coast.\n\nLoule is a small and charming market town just five minutes from the property. The bustling town has fresh meat and vegetables for sale every day and a lovely family atmosphere, growing 10 times its size on Saturdays, according to Ms. Buechner. It\u2019s also home to many music festivals throughout the year that see an influx of thousands of people, such as a jazz festival and a Mediterranean festival.\n\nPalmeiral, only a 10-minute drive from the more traditionally sought-after golf resorts and beaches of the Algarve, offers buyers a more authentic Portuguese atmosphere.\n\nFrom Penta: Banksy\u2019s \u2018Devolved Parliament\u2019 Heading to Auction Prior to Brexit Day\n\nMs. Buechner added that the houses being built in this area have a spec as good as any house Savills has in their books anywhere, while being more affordable than the golf resort prices which, having risen consistently over the past 20 years, are now \"too expensive for most mortals.\"\n\nAgent: Kerstin Buechner, a director at QP Savills\n\nView the original listing.
