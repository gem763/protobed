Surely there will be resolutions soon on Ukraine and impeachment, as well as on the misconduct of the FBI and CIA during the 2016 election.\n\nAll that will happen any day now, my sunny side assures me. One fine morning we\u2019ll wake up to learn President Trump and his tormentors are calling a cease-fire because they realize the dizzying tit-for-tat escalation is too hot for America\u2019s good.\n\nThen we can all breathe a sigh of relief and get back to politics as normal, with Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives engaged in a tug of war that is serious but not destructive. The impact on the 2020 election will be immediate as the candidates pivot to the traditionally decisive issues of taxes and spending, war and peace.\n\nAlas, the pessimist in me knows better. When it comes to human \u00adnature, never assume the best.\n\nThat part of me embraces the definition of a cynic as a \u201cpremature realist.\u201d It senses something fundamental is changing before our eyes, that the bonds that allowed political and cultural combatants to fight hard but with respect for boundaries have snapped.\n\nWe are now floating free of rules and restraint. Anything goes and there is no end in sight.\n\nThe blame game is part of any standoff and this one is no exception. Half the country blames Trump for our national discord, and they are partially right, though not for the reasons they believe.\n\nTo point the finger at him for the bitter polarization is either ignorance or historic revisionism. America was deeply divided under the three previous presidents, so Trump cannot be solely responsible. Like most presidents, he is a \u00adreaction to what came before.\n\nThat\u2019s not to suggest he plays no role. Of course he does. His fundamental nature is to disrupt and he has, in good ways and bad.\n\nHe can be compulsive and childish and seems not to have mastered the art of the team. The constant churn of top personnel is troubling.\n\nYet singling out Trump for the turmoil engulfing the country is possible only if you disregard the No. 1 contributor: the refusal of Democrats and most of the media to accept the results of the 2016 election.\n\nThat refusal has become, among many on the left, borderline psychotic. Nothing else compares to the damage it is doing to our \u00adnation\u2019s fabric and global image.\n\nTrump\u2019s irritating foibles and unorthodox ways pale in comparison. The continuing challenge to his legitimacy is a cancer on the republic.\n\nIt is one thing for a president to suffer brickbats for failures and mistakes. That\u2019s fair game.\n\nBut no president in modern times has also faced endless assaults on his right to even set foot in the Oval Office and exercise the powers of the presidency. Yet here we are, nearing the third anniversary of his election by a decisive margin, and still the resistance to his right to govern rages on.\n\nThe precedent is terrifying. If this is the start of losers always declaring election results invalid, America is doomed.\n\nTo grasp the significance, consider an alternative outcome to the Robert Mueller probe. Imagine the special counsel found compelling evidence that Trump conspired with Russia to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\nAssuming the evidence was airtight, Republicans would have joined Dems in telling Trump it was time to resign, or be impeached and removed from office.\n\nThat outcome would have been supported by the vast majority of the public because we are fundamentally a nation of patriots who cherish our freedoms. Self-government is the essence of those freedoms. The people get to pick their president.\n\nIf that right had been clearly compromised by a candidate working with a hostile foreign power, there would have been little discussion and zero sympathy. It would have been lights out for the Trump presidency.\n\nBut Trump is still president because Mueller couldn\u2019t find the bare minimum evidence needed to make a case. He had two years, an unlimited budget and a team brimming with prosecutors eager to nail the president.\n\nMueller was never fired, testified that no one tried to limit his probe or cut his resources \u2014 and still he couldn\u2019t deliver the goods.\n\nIn America, that means the case is closed. That should have been the end of it.\n\nThe dirty tricks in 2016, the flames of treason fanned by Hillary Clinton and top members of the Obama administration, the wild media scoops and whispered accusations \u2014 all of it had been considered and found to have no merit. The Russia, Russia, Russia charge was false and it was time to move on.\n\nInstead, the left immediately began searching for another silver bullet. One way or another, they would bring down Donald Trump.\n\nThus was born Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. In an instant replay, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff again declared the president guilty of impeachable \u00adoffenses before they held a single hearing.\n\nTheir only evidence was the flawed, secondhand claim of an anonymous source with partisan ties. They don\u2019t care. They are on a mission to destroy.\n\nClinton, incapable of shame and impervious to anything but self-interest, emerged again to declare Trump \u201can illegitimate president.\u201d\n\nThe media, too, jumped on the Ukraine bandwagon, giddy with certainty that this time, they\u2019ll get the president they hate.\n\nTo hear the fulminations, impeachment won\u2019t be enough. Only a public hanging will satisfy their bloodlust.\n\nThere is no way to know how or when this madness ends. Only one thing is certain: it won\u2019t end well.\n\nTime to step up, mayor!\n\nFollowing a brutal attack on a Queens child by a homeless man, Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a 30-day study of relevant city programs. Ho hum.\n\nHere\u2019s a better idea: The mayor should roll up his sleeves and lead the study himself. Delegating this vital job only reinforces the idea that it is business as usual.\n\nIn that case, the study will make headlines for a day, the mayor will promise to throw more than the $2 billion the city is already spending on the problem \u2014 and nothing else will change.\n\nFollowing the brutal deaths of four homeless men in Chinatown, allegedly at the hands of another homeless man, it is obvious the programs are failing.\n\nThis is a crisis, and taking charge is what a real mayor would do. It\u2019s time for de Blasio to at least play the part.\n\nEven JFK takes a toll\n\nReader Michael Marolda says the Port Authority\u2019s sky-high tolls aren\u2019t the only rip-off. He writes: \u201cI returned home last night and had to laugh at the condition of JFK versus airports in Athens, Naples and Paris. And in those countries, luggage carts are free. At JFK, it costs $6 to push your luggage out of the airport.
