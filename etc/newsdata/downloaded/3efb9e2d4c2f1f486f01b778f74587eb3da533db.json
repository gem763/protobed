The public response, she said, has been \u2018overwhelming\u2019\n\n'I had to say something': the comedian who confronted Harvey Weinstein\n\nNo one seemed to be acknowledging the fact that Harvey Weinstein was sitting at a private table in the back.\n\nBy the time comedian Kelly Bachman took the stage at Actors Hour \u2013 a New York showcase for emerging performers \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t want to, necessarily, but I really felt like I had to say something,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a comic, and it\u2019s our job to name the elephant in the room,\u201d she said, once she took the stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will. I didn\u2019t realize I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour.\u201d\n\nThe comedian didn\u2019t expect to end up at the center of a media frenzy when she confronted the disgraced producer. After a video of her calling out Weinstein went viral, she has been championed as an inspiration and a hero. In an interview with the Guardian, she says the reaction has been validating but also \u201coverwhelming\u201d.\n\n'Freddy Krueger in the room': women confront Harvey Weinstein at New York event Read more\n\nBachman didn\u2019t anticipate encountering Weinstein at the event, which bills itself as an intimate \u201cspeakeasy\u201d for writers, directors, actors, musicians. \u201cI really wanted to tape my new 10-minute set that night,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like it was going to be a warm room.\u201d\n\nAs soon as she mentioned Weinstein, \u201cI felt like all the air was sucked out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very cold room.\u201d\n\nPeople in the audience booed and heckled as she continued, \u201cSorry, that killed at group therapy for rape survivors.\u201d\n\nWarning: the below video contains strong language\n\n\n\nThat got a few cheers. Bachman, who said she was a rape survivor herself, recently produced a show called Rape Jokes by Survivors, for which she enlisted a dozen survivors to share their stories and experiences. \u201cOut of respect for them, and out of respect for myself, I had to say something.\u201d\n\nMore than 80 women have accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and harassment. The producer posted $1m bail after being arrested on rape charges last year and has made few public appearances since.\n\nIn a statement, Weinstein\u2019s publicist Juda Engelmayer said: \u201cThis scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.\u201d\n\nWeinstein has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex. Engelmayer did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\n\nDownright Rude (Amber Rollo) (@ambercrollo) Harvey Weinstein statement called me \"downright rude.\" You know what's rude? Rape. GTFOH\n\nAfter confronting Weinstein, Bachman resumed her set as she\u2019d initially planned. \u201cPeople laughed at my set, and actually my set did well,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the host came back on and he just went on with the rest of the show.\u201d\n\n\n\nLater on, another comedian mentioned that Good Will Hunting \u2013 a Weinstein production \u2013 \u201cwas great\u201d. Otherwise, no one else mentioned Weinstein, who was seated near the door of the basement venue, flanked by several women and two bodyguards. \u201cEveryone was acting like it was a normal occurrence,\u201d Bachman said.\n\nThen, at intermission, the actor Zoe Stuckless, who was in the audience, confronted Weinstein directly. \u201cNobody is going to say anything?\u201d Stuckless shouted in a video they posted to their Facebook. \u201cNobody is really going to say anything?\u201d they continued, pointing a finger toward Weinstein.\n\n\u201cBecause Harvey is sitting by the door, and we had to pass by him to get out of there, I felt like a lot of us didn\u2019t feel comfortable just getting up and leaving right away,\u201d Bachman recalled. \u201cAt intermission, it felt a bit easier to move around.\u201d\n\nAfter Stuckless confronted Weinstein, and was ushered out, Amber Rollo \u2013 a comedian who performs in a band called Boys Drool with Bachman \u2013 approached the producer as well.\n\n\u201cAnd then we all left,\u201d Bachman said.\n\nThat night, she kept replaying the evening\u2019s events in her head. \u201cI just kept thinking: I wish I\u2019d said more, or maybe I should have said less.\u201d Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have continued on with her set, she thought. Maybe she should have walked out earlier.\n\n\u201cI was kind of beating myself up about it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe next day, Bachman woke up to thousands of new followers on social media. \u201cI just woke up to such overwhelming support and positive messages,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me the best part was other comedians showing their support. When a colleague is like \u2018You did good,\u2019 that\u2019s a really big deal to me.\u201d\n\nThe comedian Nikki Glaser said she was \u201cfloored and inspired\u201d by Bachman\u2019s bravery. And in a post about Bachman, the comedy writer Mitra Jouhari said, \u201cThis is awesome and legit brave and you were funny while standing up to him to boot.\u201d\n\nThe Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, who has testified before Congress about her own experience surviving rape, has also defended Bachman, Rollo and Stuckless on Twitter.\n\nBy the evening, Bachman said she was inundated by media requests. \u201cIt\u2019s been overwhelming,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, Good Morning America is about to be my living room.\u201d\n\nHer phone was buzzing with notifications. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant stream,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t really had time to process.\u201d\n\nRollo has echoed the sentiment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to any more reporters right now,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m crashing, and the evilness of that room is setting in.\u201d\n\nIn the day and a half since the event, the venue \u2013 Downtime Bar in New York\u2019s Lower East Side neighborhood \u2013 appears to have taken down its Facebook page after initially posting a note that appeared to refer to Stuckless as a heckler.\n\nThe organizer of Actor\u2019s Hour has also apologized for her handling of the situation. \u201cI want to sincerely apologize to any people \u2013 male or female \u2013 who were re-traumatized, hurt, or felt disrespected this week at Actors Hour,\u201d Alexandra Laliberte wrote in a Facebook note. \u201cMr Weinstein will not be attending any future Actor\u2019s Hour events.\u201d\n\nBachman said she was glad she had spoken up. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s always the comic\u2019s job to make people feel comfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this situation, we pointed out that there was a monster in the room. I didn\u2019t want people to feel comfortable with that.\u201d", "description": "Kelly Bachman called out the mogul when he showed up at a New York performance.
