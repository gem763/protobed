In their letter, the pair cite a case in which a transgender asylum-seeker had a finger cut off by a drug cartel in Mexico while she waited for her exemption request to be processed.\n\nBaldwin is the first openly-gay senator in the history of the U.S., and is currently serving her second term.\n\nWarren has released a slew of progressive policy proposals in recent weeks as part of her presidential campaign. In one plan, Warren promises to detain transgender prisoners with inmates of the opposite biological sex, and laid out her support for federally-funded gender transition medical care for transgender inmates.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Senators Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Tammy Baldwin (D., Wisc.) sent a letter on Thursday to the Department of Homeland Security urging the agency to allow transgender migrants to remain in the U.S. while their asylum cases are processed, rather than being returned to Mexico in accordance with current", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XpE_Ef_4h_kIZxIKHhfD4Q--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/elizabeth-warren-lgbt-town-hall.jpg?fit=1024%2C597&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
