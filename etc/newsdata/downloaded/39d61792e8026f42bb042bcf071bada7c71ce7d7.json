Fabric is important; you need something light enough that you can tie around your waist if desired but not too flimsy so it allows all of the cold air in.\n\nYou also need decent sized pockets to stash your keys and possibly your smartphone \u2013 this is key for those going on long distance runs, who might also want to bring snacks/tissues/running gels with them.\n\nFor those who favour night time running, reflective detail is essential too in keeping you visible and safe on the roads. And of course, design plays a key role for some.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The slim-fitting zip-up jacket is the perfect additional layer for a blustery autumn run. It fits like a glove, features loopholes for your thumbs and is thin enough to make you feel like you\u2019re not wearing anything at all. Plus the design is undeniably stylish, with clever stitching going down the torso designed to flatter any woman\u2019s figure. There are zip pockets on either side too that are just about big enough to squeeze in a smartphone and a set of house keys.\n\nBuy now\n\nSweaty Betty fast track running jacket: \u00a395, Sweaty Betty\n\nThis urban running jacket features a handy hood, making it ideal for any rainy runs. You can also pack away the hood if you like. A reflective trim on the side of either sleeve makes it a safe choice for evening running, too. And it features a back pocket that you can pop your essentials in if desired. The design is not quite as fashion-forward as some of the other jackets mentioned here, but it does feature an innovative layered look that offers a sportswear chic aesthetic.\n\nBuy now\n\nPerff studio supreme jacket: \u00a3210, Perff\n\nThis is for people who want a running jacket that doesn\u2019t look like a running jacket. The gold zip detailing and sleeve logo is akin to something you\u2019d find on a streetwear piece. But this item is surprisingly practical too, with perforated mesh at the back designed to keep you cool and two small pockets to store any running necessities. It also features a stylish black stripe at the back, another design choice that gives it a fashionable edge over some of the brand\u2019s other jacket offerings.\n\nBuy now\n\nM&S collection quick dry half zip run top: \u00a319.50, Marks & Spencer\n\nThis simple running jacket is perfectly workable for the average runner. It might be a little too loose-fitting for someone going on a long distance run (and the fact that the zip can only be undone part of the way might be irritating a few miles in), but for a quick 5km this will do the job quite nicely. The price is reasonable as well, a welcome change in the increasingly expensive world of athleisure. The fabric is really breathable and stretches easily, meaning it can be easily and comfortably tied around your waist if you decide to get too hot during your run.\n\nBuy now\n\nNike tech pack: \u00a3105, Net-a-porter\n\nThis cool and lightweight jacket is brilliant for those runs when the weather is against you. The sleek white shell happens to be waterproof and is relatively sheer, making it a stylish choice too. Best to wear it over a warm long-sleeved top when temperatures really start to drop, though. That thin material alone isn\u2019t enough to keep you warm. But it will almost definitely keep you dry.\n\nBuy now\n\nAdidas by Stella McCartney performance jacket: \u00a399.95, Adidas\n\nYou\u2019d never know by looking at it, but this jacket is made from upcycled plastic waste collected from remote islands and beaches. The fit is feminine and flattering, which shouldn\u2019t be surprising when you consider it\u2019s the result of Stella McCartney\u2019s long-lasting collaboration with the sportswear giants. It also has several practical benefits, like containing ventilating mesh that will keep your temperature low if you start to get sweaty mid-run. But the real plus of this jacket is that you could probably wear it with jeans and nobody would even bat an eyelid. In short, it\u2019s a truly versatile product.\n\nBuy now\n\nUnder Armour women\u2019s zip jacket: \u00a336, Under Armour\n\nThis jacket is surprisingly soft and offers a pleasant not too tight, but close-knit fit. The sleeves are long too, and fit snugly round the wrist to prevent any cold air from coming in. The zip comes down just past your breast bone, which is a nice length for both practical and sartorial purposes. You can unzip it when you\u2019re feeling a bit overheated and reveal a significant amount of skin. Or you could simply unzip it to reveal a sprightly coloured sports bra underneath, adding a splash of colour to your workout look if the rest is all-black.\n\nBuy now\n\nReebok x Victoria Beckham hooded shell jacket: \u00a3230, Net-a-porter\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder this is one of the most stylish inclusions in the list given that British fashion designer Victoria Beckham helped create it. It\u2019s a looser fit than some of the other jackets mentioned here, so might be more suited to those going on a light, short-distance jog as opposed to a long-distance run (all that material flapping around can become annoying after about 20 minutes). But the drawstring hem means you can adjust the jacket\u2019s fit and make it a little tighter if desired. There\u2019s also a hidden internal hood to protect you from rain and snow. Elasticated cuffs also help to keep the chilly air from creeping up your arms. Bonus points.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Women\u2019s running jackets for autumn\n\nIt has to be the Lululemon define jacket thanks to its flattering fit and lightweight fabric. This is the running jacket that will go the distance in terms of mileage and durability. It also looks impeccably stylish and can easily be worn to a post-workout brunch.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
