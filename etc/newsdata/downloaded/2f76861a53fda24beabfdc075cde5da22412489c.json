Trump is viewed with as much disapproval as Richard M. Nixon saw, when only 19 percent of the country thought he should be impeached, but support for impeaching Trump is equivalent to what Nixon saw when he was mired at 25 percent approval.\n\nIt is with that in mind that we share news of two new polls on impeachment, one from Quinnipiac University and another from CNN and its polling partners at SSRS. In both polls, support for impeachment increased since the most recent survey in which the pollsters asked about the possibility.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Quinnipiac\u2019s poll, support for impeaching Trump \u2014 and, important, removing him from office \u2014 climbed 10 points in the past week. It was a 20-point swing overall, with support for impeachment increasing 10 points and opposition to it falling 10 points.\n\nThe biggest change was among Democrats and the smallest among Republicans. There was also a 23-point swing among white respondents with college degrees.\n\nIn CNN\u2019s poll, a few things were different. The first is that the most recent poll was in May, not last week. The other is that the biggest party shift was among Republicans, who are now a net 21 points more likely to back impeachment and removal than they were in May. The difference between the two polls in how Republicans and Democrats moved probably lies in the different time scales: The party dynamics from late May are different than from mid-September.\n\nIn both polls, support for impeachment and removal is essentially evenly split, with about as many respondents supporting as opposing the idea.\n\nIt\u2019s worth picking out one bit of data in particular: In CNN\u2019s new poll, 14 percent of Republicans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat figure mirrors another question in Quinnipiac\u2019s poll. The pollster asked respondents whether \u201casking a foreign leader for help in defeating an opponent in an upcoming election\u201d \u2014 as Trump did, indirectly, in his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July \u2014 \u201cis or is not a good enough reason to impeach a president and remove them from office?\u201d\n\nMost respondents said that was a good enough reason, including 17 percent of Republicans.\n\nOne particularly interesting part of Quinnipiac\u2019s survey is that it asked respondents about impeachment and removal as well as about a less severe impeachment inquiry, along the lines of what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced last week.\n\nAcross the board, support for an inquiry was only slightly higher than support for straight-up impeachment and removal.\n\nOn the one hand, that suggests that those who support an inquiry are almost all people who think Trump should be removed from office. On the other, though, it also suggests that those who oppose removing Trump from office aren\u2019t even interested in investigating the Ukraine issue.\n\nThat\u2019s probably partly a function of the fact that people tend to see the impeachment push as a partisan issue. Most respondents told Quinnipiac they believed the impeachment push that is underway was more a function of partisan politics than the facts of the case.\n\nIn CNN\u2019s poll, the numbers were slightly more optimistic for Democrats, with about half of respondents saying they thought the party actually believed that Trump had committed impeachable offenses \u2014 about 10 percentage points more than the group that thought Democrats were just out to get Trump. About as many respondents said they thought Republicans were out to protect Trump at any cost as said they believed Republicans actually believed that Trump hadn\u2019t committed impeachable offenses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019ll add another overarching caveat here: Even in the context of this moment, setting aside any historical comparisons, it\u2019s worth looking at all this with a few grains of salt. Things are evolving rapidly; there were multiple news developments on this subject as this article was being written. Analysis at FiveThirtyEight also reminds us that big, dramatic news developments can, at least temporarily, break polling.\n\nStay tuned. We\u2019re writing the history books on this one as we go.\n\nAD", "description": "Polling released Monday afternoon reinforces a recent trend.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GjGhyjSP2KDX5jhfS3tN5AZ8X9A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QXSERGYZEI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
