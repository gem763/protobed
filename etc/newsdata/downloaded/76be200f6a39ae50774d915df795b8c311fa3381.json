Nah. The failure to stop Sept. 11? Nope. How about Pearl Harbor? Not even close.\n\n\u201cThe worst single mistake ever made in the history of our country: going into the Middle East, by President Bush,\u201d the president said during an exclusive interview with Hill.TV. \u201cObama may have gotten (U.S. soldiers) out wrong, but going in is,to me, the biggest single mistake made in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nSo why was it so catastrophic?\n\n\u201cBecause we spent $7 trillion in the Middle East. Now if you wanna fix a window some place they say, 'oh gee, let\u2019s not do it.' Seven trillion, and millions of lives \u2014 you know, \u2018cause I like to count both sides.
