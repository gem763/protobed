Is a Jeremy Corbyn government actually the safe option? If you\u2019ve been persuaded by the years of warnings from most of the media and countless politicians that such a government would be extreme, chaotic, authoritarian and doomed to failure, you may find this question ridiculous. If you\u2019re still a Corbynista, then the notion of him as a stabilising premier for today\u2019s turbulent Britain may be equally absurd. For many believers, the whole point of Corbynism has been the possibility that it might lead to \u201cthe most radical government in British history\u201d, as the leftwing theorist and activist Jeremy Gilbert yearningly put it in 2017.\n\nYet people in unexpected places are starting to consider a Corbyn government less risky than the alternatives. Earlier this month, Oliver Harvey, an analyst for Deutsche Bank in the City of London, told the Telegraph: \u201cWe see the magnitude of economic damage caused by a no-deal Brexit as much higher than [that caused by] policies proposed in the last Labour manifesto.\u201d In the same article, Christian Schulz, an analyst for Citibank, noted approvingly that \u201cLabour has become more decisively pro-EU\u201d, while \u201ca fiscally profligate no-deal Conservative government\u201d had become less \u201centicing\u201d.\n\nLabour\u2019s policies \u2013 so often dismissed as weird and naive \u2013 have in fact often carefully gone with the grain of public opinion\n\nOff the record, other senior people in the City tell me they find the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has been circulating among them busily in recent months, a serious and intriguing figure: a supposed Marxist who looks, and sometimes talks, a bit like a bank manager.\n\nA similar thaw is under way in the more thoughtful parts of the business press. With western capitalism having a crisis of confidence, at the very least \u2013 this week the Financial Times announced \u201cCapitalism: time for a reset\u201d \u2013 Labour\u2019s radical economic alternatives have begun to look more reasonable to some business journalists. The Economist, despite its longstanding support for the Thatcherite free-market reforms that McDonnell would like to reverse, has been covering the development of Labour\u2019s new economic thinking with intense curiosity since 2017. This month, the more cautious, centrist FT has published a succession of long articles about \u201cLabour\u2019s new establishment\u201d and its ambitions for Britain. While the pieces were still spiked with criticisms, the scale of the coverage has suggested a degree of respect \u2013 and that corporate Britain needs to understand Corbynism, and be prepared to make some accommodations with it.\n\nMeanwhile, even some Conservatives have been daring to say the unsayable. In August, the Welsh MP Guto Bebb, a defence minister until last year, declared that \u201ca short-term [caretaker] Jeremy Corbyn government\u201d would be \u201cless damaging\u201d than a no-deal Brexit. A fortnight ago, the former chancellor Ken Clarke made the same heretical claim to the Observer, while conspicuously failing to add that a Corbyn administration should be a caretaker one.\n\nWhy are sections of the establishment being drawn to Corbyn and McDonnell now, having ignored or dismissed them for so long? On the face of it, the shift is all about stopping or moderating Brexit, at any cost. A little less obviously, it\u2019s about the condition of the Conservative government: its snowballing incompetence, its increasingly manic and fantastical policies, its disregard for democracy and the law, its readiness to break up the UK, and its shallow pool of talent after almost a decade in power. (Priti Patel doesn\u2019t seem likely to become one of the great home secretaries.) As Westminster participants and observers used to say, in more consensual times, it\u2019s time for a swing of the pendulum.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke made the heretical claim that a Corbyn government would be better than a no-deal Brexit.\u2019 Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nSince Corbyn became Labour leader, he and McDonnell have worked hard to seem more respectable. During Corbyn\u2019s decades on the backbenches he was a bit of a scruffy ranter; but in the Commons these days, with his neat white beard and stern glasses, he often acts more like a veteran school inspector, casting a disapproving eye over the government\u2019s shoddy work. Both he and McDonnell now wear trim suits and ties to most public occasions; the contrast with Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings\u2019 careless dishevelment might make a good election poster.\n\nThis air of solidity is not a complete illusion. Since Corbyn took over Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats have each had three leaders. Meanwhile Labour\u2019s policies \u2013 relentlessly dismissed as weird and naive by newspapers that saw no downsides to austerity and Brexit \u2013 have in fact often carefully gone with the grain of public opinion: renationalise the railways, raise taxes on the rich, put more police on the streets, avoid fighting foreign wars that lead to terrorism.\n\nPotent governments, such as Tony Blair\u2019s or Margaret Thatcher\u2019s, usually have a good understanding of how most voters are thinking and living. Under Corbyn, Labour is at least trying to do the same, by beginning to confront the crises of capitalism and the climate breakdown, and how they affect people\u2019s everyday lives.\n\nIn less than half a decade, despite never being in power, and only rarely leading in the polls, Corbyn\u2019s Labour has helped crystallise what students of the great Italian leftwing thinker Antonio Gramsci would call a new political common sense: a widespread feeling that free-market capitalism has run its course, public spending needs to rise, and the way we manage society and the economy needs to change. As a keen Gramscian, McDonnell must be delighted.\n\nLabour's tax on City deals would be a big vote winner | Larry Elliott Read more\n\nBut Labour\u2019s new respectability brings dangers. First, do British voters actually want a sober, reforming government? The polls currently suggest not: since Johnson began his cartoonish premiership, Labour has been consistently behind (though the margins have varied from substantial to tiny, usually according to the pollsters\u2019 different methods).\n\nBritain has arguably not had a Labour government with ambitions to profoundly alter the country since Harold Wilson\u2019s first in the 1960s (and his reforming zeal didn\u2019t last long). With Labour so often cautious since, many voters \u2013 and political journalists \u2013 have become unused to making the effort needed to consider novel and ambitious leftwing policies, such as McDonnell\u2019s plan to change the balance of power in companies permanently by making their workforces into major shareholders. It\u2019s easier just to dismiss such proposals as anti-business, and then get back to gossiping about the latest Tory leadership shambles.\n\nAnother problem for Labour with trying to play the grownups is that clearing up messes left by Conservative governments can be a thankless task. In 1974, Wilson\u2019s second administration inherited an economic and industrial relations crisis from the disastrous 1970-74 premiership of Edward Heath. Wilson never quite managed to resolve the crisis, and soon his party was blamed for it \u2013 so much so that Britain\u2019s struggles during the 1970s have been synonymous with Labour ever since.\n\nCorbyn and McDonnell\u2019s smart suits and new ideas will only get them a fair hearing from the establishment for so long. A Corbyn government, if it ever comes, will disrupt the status quo: \u201cChange is coming,\u201d McDonnell warned the FT this month. For the moment, some business figures may prefer a Corbyn government to a Tory one that can\u2019t guarantee the food supply; but they may soon decide that an actual reforming Labour government is not such a good idea after all. As Oliver Harvey of Deutsche Bank reassured the Telegraph, \u201cany market-unfriendly policies instigated during a Labour government\u201d need only be \u201ctemporary\u201d. They would apply only \u201cuntil the government is voted out of office\u201d. And just in case that doesn\u2019t happen quickly enough, the papers read by Britain\u2019s rich are full of articles about how to get your money out of the country.\n\n\u2022 Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the Guardian", "description": "In the face of no-deal Brexit and a crisis in capitalism, once hostile voices are considering the benefits of a Labour government, says Guardian feature writer Andy Beckett", "authors": ["Andy Beckett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e264a18547854f49ba3e86fa91b4cc7fe7c691b8/0_13_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=055330c65f4adf93ec9c05139688cf8e", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
