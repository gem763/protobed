(LLY) said its third-quarter profit rose as revenue climbed, driven by an 8% volume increase.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company posted net income of $1.25 billion, or $1.37 a share, compared with $1.15 billion, or $1.12 a share, in the comparable quarter last year.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.48 a share, beating the $1.40 a share analysts polled by FactSet had expected. The company posted $1.34 a share in adjusted earnings in the year-earlier period.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $5.48 billion, slightly below the $5.5 billion analysts had expected. The company posted $5.31 billion in revenue a year ago.\n\nEli Lilly said revenue in the U.S. stayed flat at $3.06 billion as volume for its key products, such as Trulicity, Taltz and Emgality, offset volume drop in Cialis due to loss of patent exclusivity as well as the product withdrawal of Lartruvo. Overseas sales rose 8% to $2.42 billion, Eli Lilly said.\n\nThe company now expects per-share earnings to be between $8.59 and $8.69 for the full year, a penny higher from the previous range.\n\nIt sees adjusted earnings to be between $5.75 a share and $5.85 a share, up from its previous guidance of between $5.67 a share and $5.77 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet are expecting $5.72 a share for the full year.\n\nWrite to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 06:58 ET (10:58 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
