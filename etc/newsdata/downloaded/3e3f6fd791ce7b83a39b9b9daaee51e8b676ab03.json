Biden on Tuesday marked the two-year anniversary of the Las Vegas Strip massacre \u2014 the most deadly mass shooting in recent U.S. history \u2014 by accusing President Trump of ignoring the scourge of gun violence.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner said Mr. Trump\u2019s inaction on gun control was a \u201ccapitulation\u201d to the National Rifle Association.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump isn\u2019t trying to solve this problem. He is in the pocket of the National Rifle Association. Just last week, he met behind closed doors with NRA leaders, looking for their support,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nThough Mr. Biden often champions gun control, the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s record on guns does not outshine Mr. Trump\u2018s, with at least 41 mass shootings when Mr. Biden was in the White House and no major gun laws enacted or executive actions taken.\n\nThere have been about 20 mass shootings during nearly three years of the Trump presidency, according to a Washington Post tally that includes any shooting with at least four people shot and killed.\n\nThe statement Thursday from Mr. Biden marked the Oct. 1, 2017, attack by a lone gunman at a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. The shooting took the lives of 58 people and injured hundreds more.\n\nIn response to the attack, in which the gunman used multiple rifles equipped with bump stocks that enable rapid machine gun-style firing, the Trump administration banned bump stocks.\n\nMr. Trump promised a package of new gun laws after the mass shooting in August in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, that left a total of 32 people dead.\n\nBut the administration has not yet come forward with a proposal, and Mr. Trump has vacillated about the need for expanding background checks to purchase firearms.\n\nMr. Biden said that he would be able to beat the NRA and enact tough new gun laws.\n\n\u201cAnyone who pretends there\u2019s nothing we can do is lying. I know, because I\u2019ve done it before,\u201d he said.\n\nAs he often does on the stump, Mr. Biden noted his success as a senator in helping pass the 1994 ban on military-style rifles or \u201cassault weapons\u201d and the 1993 Brady bill that established the national background check system.\n\nThe assault weapon ban expired in September 2004 and repeated attempts to resurrect have failed.\n\n\u201cWe can beat the NRA; we can get those weapons of war off our streets, and we can make sure our children don\u2019t grow up in constant fear,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cReal leadership \u2014 moral leadership \u2014 can get these reforms done.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
