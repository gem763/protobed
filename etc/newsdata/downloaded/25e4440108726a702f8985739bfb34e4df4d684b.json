For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nThe day after Major League Baseball said it was investigating a tweet from umpire Rob Drake calling for a civil war if President Donald Trump is impeached, the umpire unlocked his Twitter account and apologized in a string of tweets.\n\n\"I want to personally apologize to everyone that my words made feel less safe. I especially want to apologize to every person who has been affected by gun violence in our country. I also acknowledge and apologize for the controversy this has brought to Major League Baseball.\n\n\"Also, my fellow umpires, and my family. I never intended to diminish the threat of violence from assault weapons, or violence of any kind.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to learn from this. Once I read what I had tweeted I realized the violence in those words and have since deleted it. I know that I cannot unsay the words, but please accept my apologies. Sincerely, Rob Drake\"\n\nDrake during a game in June 2018. (Photo: John E. Sokolowski, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nESPN reported Wednesday night that Drake tweeted he was going to buy an assault weapon \"because if you impeach MY PRESIDENT this way, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CIVAL WAR!!! #MAGA2020.\"\n\nDrake deleted the tweet soon afterwards, and then switched his account to private mode on Wednesday.\n\nBefore his account went private, USA TODAY Sports reviewed past tweets from Drake, which included messages claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the United States and a tweet to Hillary Clinton calling her an \"(expletive) liar.\"\n\nThe Major League Umpires Association released a statement on its Facebook page acknowledging Drake's tweet:\n\n\"Rob is a passionate individual and an outstanding umpire. He chose the wrong way to convey his opinion about our great country. His posting does not represent the view of the MLBUA or reflect those of the umpires we represent,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The MLBUA supports all of the umpires who ensure fair play in the greatest game on earth. We are a group of individuals with diverse opinions and beliefs, united in our desire to continue our excellence officiating MLB games.\"\n\nDrake made his major league debut in 1999.", "description": "Drake deleted the tweet soon afterwards, and then switched his account to private mode on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published P.M.
