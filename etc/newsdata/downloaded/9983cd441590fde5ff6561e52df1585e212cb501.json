Her attack on Tulsi does likewise. In my district, Trump did worse than any Republican in modern times and still beat Clinton by a fair margin. Many Ds in the Midwest rejected her. I didn\u2019t vote for either one. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) October 19, 2019\n\nClinton on Friday warned during a podcast interview that Russia was poised meddle again in the next U.S. presidential election through online disinformation efforts, and she said Moscow could attempt to sow chaos by encouraging a third-party candidate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her, so far,\u201d Clinton said in an apparent reference to Gabbard, who has faced unfounded speculation that her campaign is being amplified by bots and online trolls.\n\nGabbard later Friday unleashed an attack on the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, calling her the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and the \u201cpersonification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\"From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you,\" she said, challenging Clinton to join the primary instead of \u201ccowardly hid[ing] behind your proxies.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
