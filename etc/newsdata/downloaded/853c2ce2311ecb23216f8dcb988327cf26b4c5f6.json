Rather than allowing lies to triumph, listen to the angels of your better nature and rule that this prorogation is unlawful, an abuse of power which has been entrusted to the government.\n\n\u201cThis government has shown itself unworthy of our trust, as it uses the powers of its office in a manner that is corrosive of the constitution and destructive of the system of parliamentary, representative democracy upon which the union polity is founded. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nHe urged the judges: \u201cStand up for the truth, stand up for reason, stand up for unity and diversity, stand up for parliament, stand up for democracy by dismissing this government\u2019s appeal and upholding a constitution governed by laws and not the passing whims of men\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the government earlier in the day, Sir James Eadie QC defended Mr Johnson\u2019s decision not to provide a witness statement.\n\nHe said the government had made available an internal No10 memo and a set of cabinet minutes that showed Mr Johnson had not been trying to \u201cstymie\u201d parliament when he asked the Queen to order the prorogation. Such claims were \u201cuntenable\u201d and \u201cunsustainable\u201d, he said.", "description": "Boris Johnson was dubbed \u201cthe father of lies\u201d and his government accused of playing \u201cdishonest, dirty tricks\u201d on the second day of a Supreme Court hearing into the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament.Lawyers acting for a cross-party group of more than 70 MPs and peers attacked the Mr Johnson", "authors": ["Benjamin Kentish"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6IkeBeMQeYBGl9NDQPQcFw--~B/aD0zNDA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/d55ac3d70fc0f2a730f5ac2e84f08af3", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
