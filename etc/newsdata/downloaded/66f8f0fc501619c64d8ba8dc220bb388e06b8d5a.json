All our hard work and efforts in previous days and years were to get us to this moment,\u201d said Roni al-Asaad, a 32-year-old activist in central Beirut.\n\n\u201cIf they could have implemented these reforms before, why haven\u2019t they? And why should we believe them today?\u201d\n\nAt the nerve centre of the demonstrations near the country\u2019s houses of government in central Beirut, volunteers were once again collecting rubbish from the streets, many wearing face masks and plastic gloves.\n\nThe protests have grown steadily since public anger first spilled onto the streets Thursday evening in response to a proposed tax on calls via WhatsApp and other messaging services.\n\nWhile the government quickly dropped that plan, the leaderless protests morphed into demands for a sweeping overhaul of the political system, with grievances ranging from austerity measures to poor infrastructure.\n\nHariri had given his coalition partners three days to support reforms he said were crucial to get the economy back on track.\n\nOn Sunday evening a cabinet official told AFP that the parties had agreed.\n\nThe cabinet will hold a meeting chaired by President Michel Aoun at 10:30 am (0730 GMT) to discuss the reforms.\n\nDemonstrators said Hariri\u2019s proposals would not be enough, with demands for the entire political class to resign.\n\n\u201cAll of them are warlords,\u201d said Patrick Chakar, 20. \u201cWe waited 30 years or more for them to change and they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMore than a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, the World Bank says, while the political class has remained relatively unchanged since the end of a devastating 15-year civil war in 1990.\n\nLebanon ranked 138 out of 180 in Transparency International\u2019s 2018 corruption index, and residents suffer chronic electricity and water shortages.\n\nLebanese media hailed the demonstrations.\n\nAl-Akhbar newspaper, which is close to Shiite Muslim militant party Hezbollah, published a picture of protesters carrying a giant flag on its front page with a commentary on \u201cTest Day: Power or People?\u201d.\n\nThe French-language newspaper L\u2019Orient-Le Jour said \u201cThe hour of truth has arrived,\u201d while the English-language The Daily Star said: \u201cLebanon\u2019s only paths: reform or abyss.\u201d", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Lebanese protesters were expected to return to the streets for a fifth day Monday, with Prime Minister Saad Hariri holding a cabinet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/765846_hundreds-thousands-people-joined-protests-demanding-sweeping-overhaul-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
