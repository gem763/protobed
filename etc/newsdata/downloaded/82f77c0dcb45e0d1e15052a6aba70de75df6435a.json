When asked by the host what the world would look like in 2050 after the everyone began dealing with climate change and carbon emissions, he suggested that the end of private car ownership was probably on the horizon. (Free Beacon)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said the United States may have to eliminate private car ownership to combat climate change during MSNBC\u2019s climate forum at Georgetown University Thursday morning. He told MSNBC host Ali Velshi that \u201cwe might not own our own cars\u201d by 2050 to wean the United States economy off of fossil fuels, describing private car ownership as \u201creally inefficient and bad for the environment.\u201d Privately owned cars would be replaced by a \u201cconstant roving fleet of electric cars.\u201d A video posted by the GOP War Room shows Velshi asking Yang what measures he sees the world taking to fight climate change by 2050.\n\nHere\u2019s the video of his full comments on the subject.\n\nThere are two sides to this proposal, consisting of the practical and the political. Being as we are in the midst of a presidential race, the political may be more important in the short term. The fact is that the Democrats seem to keep coming up with ideas that may look good on paper at liberal cocktail parties but are not at all popular with the voters at large. Eliminating private car ownership is just such a proposal.\n\nPeople love their cars. Nearly everyone realizes that they are expensive luxuries and account for too much pollution, but we still live in a car culture. It\u2019s a status symbol and a totem of our freedom of movement. No matter how well-intentioned you may be, if you come along and say the government needs to take away all your cars, the public is going to be up on their hind legs. This is the way you lose elections.\n\nOn the practical side, I will grudgingly admit that Yang is probably at least partially correct about this. If he was saying there would be nothing but mass transit, that would be nuts. Mass transit simply isn\u2019t practical for most of the country unless you live in a densely populated urban area. But he\u2019s also picturing fleets of electric, driverless vehicles that anyone can summon when they need to go somewhere. Uber and Lyft are working on just such a plan right now and sooner or later it may become our new reality.\n\nBut having said that, electric vehicles still need to be powered. Until you answer the question of where you\u2019re going to come up with all of the electricity needed to replace the power currently being generated by gasoline, you\u2019re not going to be doing much for the climate. As I mentioned yesterday when talking about efforts in California to eliminate natural gas usage, the state derives roughly half of their electricity from natural gas plants. If all of the cars are suddenly running on electricity, they\u2019re going to be burning a massively larger amount of natural gas to meet the demand.\n\nYet again, we\u2019re seeing the Church of Climate Change forcing Democrats to toss out expensive, impractical ideas that most people will rebel against. And they can\u2019t seem to help themselves.", "description": "Come and get 'em", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Hot Air Staff"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2fb4bc12-3681-4499-94e1-03c364b4968a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
