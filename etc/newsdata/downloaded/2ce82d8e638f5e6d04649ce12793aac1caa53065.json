The Straits Times\n\nPeople are calling for a PMD ban in Singapore after an elderly woman died in a collision with an illegally-modified e-scooter.\n\nOn Monday (Oct 7), Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary said the Government would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to ban PMDs if riders did not improve their behaviour.\n\nSupport for a six-month-old online petition against PMDs has spiked, reaching close to 69,000 signatures on Thursday (Oct 10).\n\nAn opposing petition to keep PMDs garnered over 500 signatures.\n\nIt looks like Singaporeans have had enough of personal mobility devices (PMDs).\n\nA petition created six months ago, calling for a ban of the now-ubiquitous transport mode here, has attracted renewed interest after the recent and high-profile death of an elderly cyclist hit by a 20-year-old e-scooter rider.\n\nHis illegally modified scooter could hit speeds of up to 80km/h \u2013 the equivalent of a car on an expressway, authorities found.\n\nRead also: LTA is warning irresponsible PMD users with hashtags like #WeAreWatchingYou in its latest Facebook video\n\nThe accident, mentioned in Parliament on Monday (Oct 7), led Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary to hint that the Government could \u201chave no choice\u201d but to ban PMDs if accidents continued.\n\nIt would take years to build dedicated PMD lanes, he said, so the ministry would take the next one or two months to review a \u201cdifficult\u201d decision if PMDs should be allowed elsewhere in the meantime.\n\nAdded the minister: \u201cWe are determined to improve footpath safety back to the levels we had before PMDs were allowed.\u201d\n\nThe number of signatures on a change.org petition started in April by user Zachary Tan doubled to almost 69,000 within weeks of the accident, after Tan updated it with an email he sent to Transport Minister Lam Pin Min.\n\nScreenshot\n\nIn the email \u2013 also addressed to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Law Minister K Shanmugam \u2013 Tan said able-bodied thrill seekers were behind speeding PMDs, not deliverymen or those with genuine mobility issues.\n\nHe added that banning PMDs might cost deliverymen their livelihood, but victims of PMD accidents suffered pain, disability, and death.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to think of a scenario where depriving riders of their PMD will land them in similar distress\u2026 (making it) difficult to justify prioritising the convenience and rights of PMD riders over pedestrian safety,\u201d he said, suggesting that deliveries be done on bicycles instead.\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nTan also raised Singapore\u2019s ban on guns, chewing gum, and alcohol sales after 10.30pm, as examples of sacrificing the rights of a small group to benefit society at large.\n\n\u201cCould LTA thus apply the same thought process when banning e-scooters and e-bikes?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe concept of a safe space has been taken away from pedestrians, who should not have an obligation to constantly check for traffic on a non-vehicle path.\u201d\n\nRead also: Almost half of Singapore drivers feel that roads are now more dangerous \u2013 and it\u2019s got to do with e-scooters and ride-sharing vehicles\n\nWhen Business Insider viewed the petition at noon on Thursday (Oct 10), signatures were still pouring in by the minute, with hundreds of fed up pedestrians leaving supportive comments.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to walk freely and assuredly with my kid,\u201d said user Chrisvian Tan, while tourist Vasanthan Govindasamy said he was \u201cjust so scared to use the footpath\u201d with his child in tow while on holiday here.\n\nOne user, Samuel Tay, said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for authorities to treat pedestrians as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d just to prop up the delivery economy. Others said pedestrians\u2019 use of mobile phones contributed to the danger.\n\nMany recounted incidences of speeding PMDs, and said they feared for their elderly parents and young children. \u201cI\u2019ve had and seen a few close shaves, and the PMD riders just went on their way nonchalantly, assuming they have right of way,\u201d said Ping Low, while Linus Seet described speeding perpetrators as \u201cblaring loud music\u201d and installing \u201csuper-bright headlights\u201d.

Linahe Wanbao\n\nAccording to a recent survey of 1,116 Singaporeans by market research firm YouGov, 42 per cent of respondents supported a total PMD ban, with older respondents (over 55 years old) twice as likely to do so than younger ones (18 to 24 years old).\n\nParticipants also ranked e-scooters as the most dangerous type of transport in Singapore by far, beating out cars, motorbikes, and other PMD types like electric bicycles and regular scooters.\n\nAlmost 70 per cent of respondents said PMD use should be restricted to those with genuine mobility issues.\n\nMeanwhile, on change.org, another petition against any ban on PMDs in Singapore garnered over 500 signatures in two weeks, with supporters calling the ban \u201cunfair\u201d.\n\nMany said they used their PMDs to save money on transport or earn a living.\n\n\u201cCars kill people every year too,\u201d said a user named Dolce Li. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ban them?\u201d\n\nRead also: 70% of Singapore consumers order from food delivery apps at least once a month \u2013 and most are spending more money in recent years", "description": "Business Insider - Meanwhile, another petition not to ban PMDs garnered over 500 signatures..
