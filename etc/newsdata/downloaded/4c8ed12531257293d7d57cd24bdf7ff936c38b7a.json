In the Middle Ages, Carmelite monks operating from the 14th-century castle that\u2019s still Peralada\u2019s most famous landmark stocked their cellars with booze made from neighbouring vineyards.\n\nToday, robes and sandals are no longer part of the vintner uniform but bottles of grenache, syrah and more still come out of the Castillo de Peralada, using grapes grown in the region: on the red clay slopes of Garriguella, in the sandy soil of Pont de Molins, or along the vine-dense, slate-heavy foothills of the Pyrenees. And if any are left over, there\u2019s always the Hotel Peralada\u2019s wine spa.\n\nAside from its wine treatments, Hotel Peralada also boasts a golf course on its grounds.\n\nHere, the polyphenol-rich grape matter is repurposed into beauty products for treatments such as grape-seed peels, red-wine body wraps and vineyard \u201cflower\u201d facials, while the vintages themselves are poured into the hotel\u2019s special wine bath and wine Jacuzzi.\n\nDipping into a tub of red isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. It\u2019s said that Cleopatra enjoyed wine baths and was convinced the practice had a moisturising effect. During the Renaissance, women thought the ritual would soften their skin. At Japan\u2019s \u201chot springs amusement park\u201d in Hakone, there\u2019s a red-wine onsen that\u2019s filled by a giant novelty-sized wine bottle, while France\u2019s Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte vineyard features vine-leaf baths and has become ground zero for Mathilde Thomas\u2019 international empire of Caudalie \u201cvinotherapy\u201d beauty spas.\n\nSo Hotel Peralada doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on wine baths and treatments, but people still travel long distances to sink into its Jacuzzi bubbling with merlot.\n\nHotel Peralada\u2019s indoor pool.\n\nThe resort\u2019s spa manager, Cristina Tincu, is fluent in French, as most of her clients cross the nearby French-Spanish border to use the spa. Treatments are inspired by the ancient Romans, who were known to use grape must (juice) in massages and maintained vintner traditions after settling in the region.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of vineyards here,\u201d Tincu says, so repurposing excess wine and its by-products for bathing and beauty rituals makes sense. \u201cIf we think about the composition of the wine, you have a lot of properties that are also cleansing.\u201d Resveratrol (an antioxidant that\u2019s found in red grape skins, extracts and seeds) has been touted for its health benefits, with the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology citing its potential for treating ageing skin.", "description": "Near the birthplace of Salvador Dali in Catalonia, Hotel Peralada offers merlot shampoo, grape-seed peels \u2013 and a Jacuzzi filled with litres of red.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3169%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_58/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/55e59ad55df3089178f141c024a42021b6a32bcc", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
