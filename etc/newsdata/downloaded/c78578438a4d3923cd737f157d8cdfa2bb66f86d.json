Not only did they win every game, they never so much as trailed. And so what promised to be an exciting series was a dud\u2014unless you root for the Mets, of course, then it was heavenly. But the match-up reminded us that these two teams have a history\u2014when the Mets won their first championship in 1969 it was in part because the Cubs gagged away the division. Then, in 1973, the Cubs were there again, fighting with the Mets\u2014not to mention the Pirates and Cardinals\u2014until the last weekend of the season. If \u201973 isn\u2019t as memorable as \u201969 in New York, it\u2019s because the Mets lost in the World Series. But the drama of the regular season\u2014which included plenty of sloppy, mediocre ball, labor unrest, and personal tragedy\u2014was irresistible.\n\nAdapted from a chapter I wrote for the fine Baseball Prospectus anthology, It Ain\u2019t Over \u2018Til It\u2019s Over\u2014edited by the talented Steven Goldman and featuring essays from Kevin Baker, Allen Barra, and Nate Silver\u2014dig into the strange, compelling 1973 National League East pennant race.\n\n\u2014Alex Belth", "description": "In 1973, amid the Watergate hearings, the designated hitter debuted, Yogi Berra waxed eloquent, and Mets pitcher Tug McGraw coined his pennant-clinching team\u2019s enduring slogan.", "authors": ["Alex Belth"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492122241/articles/2015/10/24/when-the-mets-got-you-to-believe/151023-belth-stacks-mets-tease_ijjknk", "published_at": "2015-10-24"}
