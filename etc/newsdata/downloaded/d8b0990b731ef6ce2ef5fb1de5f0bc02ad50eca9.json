A small child\u2019s coffin commemorated the children and adults who have died prematurely from diseases related to air pollution.\n\nChancellor urged to double funding to tackle climate crisis Read more\n\nThe 10-minute \u201cdie-in\u201d was initially scheduled to take place outside the Treasury, but police asked the activists to congregate next to Trafalgar Square due to a separate, concurrent anti-government protest outside Downing Street.\n\nAs sombre, pre-recorded funeral music played by bagpipes rang out, protesters demanded an ecological and climate emergency autumn budget with \u00a36bn to be invested in walking and cycling.\n\n\u201cTransport is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting sector in the UK,\u201d Caspar Hughes, an organiser at Stop Killing Cyclists, said. \u201cCycling campaigning is climate campaigning. The die-in is symbolic of all the people who have lost their lives due to traffic violence, pollution and the climate.\n\nHe said the spending review was \u201claughable\u201d and criticised what he said was a stark imbalance between investment in cycling infrastructure and the expansion of the road network.\n\nDonnachadh McCarthy, the co-founder of Stop Killing Cyclists, said: \u201cWith the Arctic and Amazon on fire and tens of thousands of Britons dying from car pollution, it beggars belief that chancellor Sajid Javid is proposing more toxic fossil fuel duty cuts.\n\n\u201cThe 2019 budget must be a climate and ecological emergency budget that includes \u00a36bn per year for the creation of a national cycling network and the reversal of the toxic fuel duty cuts.\u201d\n\nMany of the protesters had cycled into London from elsewhere in the UK. Extinction Rebellion called for \u201cmassive investment\u201d in safe cycle lanes, which the group said would help protect children from fossil fuel pollution.\n\nProtesters\u2019 other demands included a reversal of fuel tax cuts and the institution of car-free villages, towns and city centres.\n\n\u201cIf there were less cars and people cycled more, we would all be healthier,\u201d Kelvin Dane, who cycled from Romford, Essex. \u201cIts quite scary when you cycle in London \u2013 it\u2019s not everybody\u2019s cup of tea. There\u2019s too many cars on the road, people are too lazy, they use cars for short distances. Its madness. People should just cycle, it\u2019s very simple.\u201d", "description": "Mock funeral procession highlights impact of cars and demands funding for cyclist safety", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34bd9cf9bdb8f116fe7a5559681cd300abe8d910/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b7aa68a181438552d7e783d3832783d", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
