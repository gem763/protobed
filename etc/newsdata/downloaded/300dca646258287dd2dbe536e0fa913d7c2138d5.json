I don\u2019t know. I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest with you. We\u2019ve got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote.\u201d\n\nCortes has been a longtime supporter of the president. This week he wrote an article for the Florida Daily headlined: \u201cPresident Trump Has Earned Hispanics\u2019 Trust.\u201d\n\nTrump added that Cortes had been sidelined from his role as a CNN political commentator because he was too positive about the president. \u201cYou were incredible on CNN and now you\u2019ll get a real job, OK? Steve, that audience wasn\u2019t big enough for you. The ratings aren\u2019t good.\u201d\n\nTrump coming to California to raise money, but keeping details secret Read more\n\nRecent research by Priorities USA, a Democratic Super Pac campaign group, found Trump\u2019s standing with Latino voters sits at just 20% approval in Arizona and 26% in Nevada, though he fares better in Florida with a 42% approval rating.\n\nAt Monday\u2019s rally in Rio Rancho on Monday night, he delivered a rambling speech that lasted more than an hour and a half. \u201cTrump 2020\u201d, \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d, and \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d signs were sprinkled through the crowd.\n\nHe made a pocketbook appeal for re-election in the Democratic-leaning state, telling voters that his energy policies had made the state wealthier and warning that the gains could disappear if the proposal knows as the Green New Deal takes effect.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico\u2019s economy,\u201d claimed Trump, who boasted that an oil and gas boom during his administration had helped increase the state\u2019s revenues. \u201cThe Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance.\u201d\n\nTrump went to New Mexico, which has not backed a Republican for president since 2004, to try to turn the state red and expand his grip on the electoral college in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nTrump\u2019s rally is the first stop on a three-day swing that will also take him to California for fundraisers expected to raise more than $15m.\n\nTrump has generally held his rallies in Republican-friendly terrain. Monday\u2019s rally represents a striking departure from that practice and demonstrates a campaign with the resources to try to turn a few Democratic-leaning states his way, similar to what happened in 2016 with Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nProtesters, for their part, vowed to step up acts of civil disobedience and demonstrations.", "description": "President asks CNN commentator Steve Cortes whether he loves US or Hispanics more at New Mexico rally", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f5924cdf91133c44e43ef999058ac09c04e3667/0_6_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c78841d237f88265f9e68e48960daa8", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
