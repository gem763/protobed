But I was not afraid.\u201d\n\nChujfi and his wife Juliana Gonz\u00e1lez both grew up in Pereira, a mountainous coffee region in Colombia (although they actually met later, after they\u2019d both left). He moved to Germany for a job as a systems engineer; back in Colombia, Gonz\u00e1lez worked in strategic communications with a background in international affairs.\n\nOf course, following her heart, Gonz\u00e1lez joined Chujfi in 2002. They both fell in love with the richness of Berlin\u2019s history and the city\u2019s potential. It wasn\u2019t an easy path\u2014Colombia is thousands of miles from Germany, in all kinds of ways\u2014but they were determined.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m going to learn German, I don\u2019t care how long it\u2019s going to take,\u2019\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez recalls. \u201cIt was just trying to realize, \u2018who am I in this new place,\u2019 and defining myself, that took more time. The first years were very confusing for me, but language was my vehicle to move forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Chujfi echoes. \u201cThat\u2019s the best decision anyone can make.\u201d\n\nChujfi eventually launched his own innovative telecommunications company, Sabienzia; he strongly believes \u201ctrustable technology is made in Germany\u201d. Gonz\u00e1lez found a job as a producer in the Spanish department of broadcaster Deutsche Welle and later worked as the deputy chief of mission at the Colombian embassy. Their two daughters, Hanna and Claire, were born in Berlin and now ping-pong fluently between Spanish, German, and English.\n\nBut two years ago, the family faced a tough decision of whether to return to Colombia. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s embassy work was putting her in very close contact with the politics and affairs in her home country, and her passion about these matters made her wonder whether it would be better to simply go back.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in the middle of a bridge, and I wondered whether I should cross that bridge or take a step back and remain here,\u201d she says.\n\nBut Chujfi had a successful business to run, and Gonz\u00e1lez was welcomed back to Deutsche Welle, where she is now a political correspondent.\n\nUltimately, it was their lifestyle that kept them in Berlin.\n\n\u201cI can ride my bike to the office, I can drop the kids off at school. You work, but you also have a fulfilled life,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cIt gives me a sense of freedom, of security. Those little but significant details make me happy and enrich me\u2014the small stuff is so important. And I\u2019m not willing to give that up.\u201d\n\nManon Roux\n\n4.5 years in Berlin\n\nManon Roux wouldn\u2019t have her story to tell if it weren\u2019t for a wildly last-minute job offer. She had been camping with a friend in Paris and applying to a slew of startup jobs in Berlin with no luck. And then, on the day her train was leaving for Berlin, she received an email about a Skype interview for a marketing position in a housing rental startup. She was hired on the spot.\n\nThe ex-Parisian arrived in the city in the winter of 2014 after deciding to quit the French capital. A six-month Erasmus exchange program in Oslo where she reveled in an international cohort had opened her eyes to the world, and she couldn\u2019t face working in Paris after going back to complete her studies there.\n\n\u201cI started feeling repressed there,\u201d Roux recalls. She had studied political science and communications at the Paris-Sorbonne University and interned at the European Parliament in France.\n\n\u201cBut I started to have this other image for myself, of someone doing something completely different than working for a political party or for French institutions. I came to Berlin really without a plan\u2014it was a complete coup de t\u00eate.\u201d\n\nIn Berlin she did a Weiterbildung\u2014German for \u201ctraineeship\u201d\u2014in website conception and online communication, and decided to forge her own way as freelancer. She now builds online communication strategies for small companies in Berlin and France.\n\nA typical weekday for Roux starts with breakfast with her boyfriend\u2014a German artist\u2014and listening to her favorite French radio show. \u201cI know I should listen to German programs, but I can\u2019t help myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t skip my mother tongue in the mornings.\u201d\n\nThen she works from home in Friedrichshain, a young, bustling neighborhood on Berlin\u2019s eastern flank, before heading out for a few client meetings in the afternoon. The evenings are devoted to German class or an art exhibition and dinner in one of the neighborhood\u2019s many restaurants.\n\nWeekends have gotten a lot more wholesome. Roux used to explore Berlin\u2019s club scene, but these days\u2014particularly during the summer\u2014her favorite thing to do is take her bike to one of the city\u2019s myriad lakes and picnic all afternoon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really a lake freak,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful to have so many lakes around Berlin. I feel so much more connected to nature here than I ever was in Paris.\u201d\n\nOf course, she misses home, but she\u2019s convinced she\u2019s found her personal island in the German capital.\n\n\u201cI also could have a very beautiful life in France,\u201d she says. \u201cBut in Paris, it\u2019s just much more coded; if you want to get your baguette, you can\u2019t go in your pajamas. I feel much better, much freer here.\u201d\n\nManuel Pessao de Lima\n\nJust arrived\n\nAs a pianist performer-composer, Manuel Pessao de Lima has always valued experimentation. And it\u2019s this personal mandate that pulled him to Berlin.\n\nAfter finishing his doctorate in musical arts in 2016 at the California Institute of the Arts, where he was also a lecturer, Lima moved back to his parents\u2019 house in his native Brazil. By 2019 his compositional repertoire already included pieces for dance, theater, cinema installations and orchestra, but he found teaching was the only sustainable way to make a living.\n\nEventually two things became clear: he had to leave the academic world, and he had to leave Brazil.\n\n\u201cI always felt really trapped inside the university,\u201d Lima says. \u201cIn Brazil, academia is very much based on a conservative French model. And you have a strong divide: either you have an academic career, or you have an artistic career, which is a whole other world.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the political climate back home was deteriorating; Jair Bolsonaro was rising to power, and once in office, he began cutting budgets from the country\u2019s top universities. Lima was pessimistic. He had three concerts in Europe, and he took the chance to visit Berlin and see if it was a place where he could find a haven.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have a situation like this, you have resistance\u2014there\u2019s more engagement from people from the left, from artists and intellectuals, and that can be empowering,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019d already felt displaced. I studied abroad and had been gone for so long.\u201d\n\nMoving to Berlin offered Lima a kind of personal liberation. It\u2019s a theme that resonates deeply within his work, which engages heavily with the notions of failure and vulnerability. And the experimental music scene here was exactly what he was searching for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect setting to experiment [with] this liberation I\u2019m in need of to be reborn artistically,\u201d Lima says. \u201cBeing a classical pianist is a very Olympic career. You\u2019re always dealing with a very high standard. I don\u2019t even have a piano here.\u201d\n\nLima is still getting settled. He\u2019s looking for long-term housing, which can be a Herculean task these days in the city, but he harbors high hopes for the future.\n\n\u201cI just really want to exist as a living artist, which is having some sort of living interaction with the present reality.\u201d\n\nJoin the wave of talented people moving to Berlin.\n\n[LEARN MORE]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/brand-studio/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_1451645828.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
