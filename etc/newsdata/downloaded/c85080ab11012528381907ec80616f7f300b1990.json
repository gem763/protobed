In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Jamie Clements claimed Mr Shorten and other MPs knew about the handouts. Mr Clements was asked by Sky News host Sharri Markson about whether Mr Shorten and other MPs had knowledge of the donations. \u201cOf course they did,\u201d Mr Clements said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it was the campaigns for their seats. It was Bill Shorten's campaign to become prime minister those donations were funding, of course.\" Mr Clements gave evidence to the ICAC earlier this month on a separate matter - about $100,000 in cash delivered to NSW Labor headquarters in an Aldi shopping bag while he was general secretary in 2015. He did not suggest that Mr Shorten knew about the $100,000 donation specifically. Mr Clements is now calling for the party to reform - providing a written submission to the party's internal review. A spokesperson for Bill Shorten told Sky News \u201cBill Shorten was the first party leader to ban foreign donations from these guys \u2013 before the Liberals. The ICAC investigation said explicitly this investigation was not into Mr Shorten. He had no personal knowledge of the NSW donation splitting controversy aired at ICAC.
