He has a new column promoting class warfare tax policy.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, Warren Buffett made a claim that would become famous. He said that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary, thanks to the many loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy. \u2026\u201cIs it the norm?\u201d the fact-checking outfit Politifact asked. \u201cNo.\u201d Time for an update: It\u2019s the norm now. \u2026the 400 wealthiest Americans last year paid a lower total tax rate \u2014 spanning federal, state and local taxes \u2014 than any other income group, according to newly released data. \u2026That\u2019s a sharp change from the 1950s and 1960s, when the wealthy paid vastly higher tax rates than the middle class or poor.\n\nHere\u2019s the supposed proof for Leonhardt\u2019s claim, which is based on a new book from two professors at the University of California at Berkeley, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.\n\nHere are the tax rates from 1950.\n\nAnd here are the tax rates from last year, showing the combined effect of the Kennedy tax cut, the Reagan tax cuts, the Bush tax cuts, and the Trump tax cut (as well as the Nixon tax increase, the Clinton tax increase, and the Obama tax increase).\n\nSo is Leonhardt (channeling Saez and Zucman) correct?\n\nAre these charts evidence of a horrid and unfair system?\n\nNope, not in the slightest.\n\nBut this data is evidence of dodgy analysis by Leonhardt and the people he cites.\n\nFirst and foremost, the charts conveniently omit the fact that dividends and capital gains earned by high-income taxpayers also are subject to the corporate income tax.\n\nEven the left-leaning Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development acknowledges that both layers of tax should be included when measuring the effective tax rate on households.\n\nIndeed, this is why Warren Buffett was grossly wrong when claiming he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary.\n\nBut there\u2019s also another big problem. There\u2019s a huge difference between high tax rates and high tax revenues.\n\nSimply stated, the rich didn\u2019t pay a lot of tax when rates were extortionary because they can choose not to earn and declare much income.\n\nIndeed, there were only eight taxpayers in 1960 who paid the top tax rates of 91 percent.\n\nToday, by contrast, upper-income taxpayers are paying an overwhelming share of the tax burden.\n\nIt\u2019s especially worth noting that tax collections from the rich skyrocketed when Reagan slashed the top tax rate in the 1980s.\n\nLet\u2019s close by pointing out that Saez and Zucman are promoting a very radical tax agenda.\n\nSaez and Zucman sketch out a modern progressive tax code. The overall tax rate on the richest 1 percent would roughly double, to about 60 percent. The tax increases would bring in about $750 billion a year, or 4 percent of G.D.P\u2026. One crucial part of the agenda is a minimum global corporate tax of at least 25 percent. \u2026Saez and Zucman also favor a wealth tax\n\nPunitive income tax rates, higher corporate tax rates, and a confiscatory wealth tax.\n\nDoes anybody think copying France is a recipe for success?\n\nP.S. I pointed out that Zucman and Saez make some untenable assumptions when trying to justify how a wealth tax won\u2019t hurt the economy.\n\nP.P.S. It\u2019s also worth remembering that the income of rich taxpayers will be subject to the death tax as well, which means Leonhardt\u2019s charts are doubly misleading.", "description": "The\u00a0New York Times is going overboard with disingenuous columns.A few .10/10/2019 14:24:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
