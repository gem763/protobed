The service member, identified Friday as Sgt. 1st Class Elis Angel Barreto Ortiz of Morovis, Puerto Rico, was the 16th American service member killed in combat in the country this year.\n\n\"If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway,\" Trump said in his tweet calling off the meeting. \"How many more decades are they willing to fight?\"\n\nUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\n....only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\nPompeo said that a few hours before his interview on \"This Week,\" he had been at Dover Air Force Base with the family of the service member who was killed on Thursday. He said the experience was \"a reminder that we\u2019ve got to get it right.\"\n\nMany, including some House Republicans, have criticized the idea of holding peace talks at Camp David in general. House Republican Caucus Chairperson Rep. Liz Cheney tweeted on Sunday, \"Camp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11. No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\"\n\nPompeo said he appreciated Cheney's view, but \"in the end, if you're going to negotiate peace, you often have to deal with some pretty bad actors.\"\n\nMark Reinstein/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. had been negotiating with the Taliban and the Afghan government to reach an agreement that could have resulted in U.S. troops leaving the country after almost 18 years of war.\n\nWhen Stephanopoulos asked if the efforts of chief U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad were dead given the president\u2019s tweets, Pompeo said, \"he\u2019s coming home for now.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo tells @GStephanopoulos that Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation at the State Department Zalmay Khalilzad is \"coming home for now,\" but adds, \"I hope it's the case that the Taliban will change their behavior\" https://t.co/YXQEmGn8Yy pic.twitter.com/bS91b8utaU \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 8, 2019\n\nDuring his appearance on \"This Week,\" Pompeo was also asked about Iran\u2019s recent move further away from the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal on Friday.\n\n\"What I predicted all along is if we stayed in the Iran nuclear deal, that we were guaranteeing the ayatollah a pathway towards a nuclear weapons system,\" Pompeo said, criticizing the Obama administration deal. \"It's why we broke away from the deal. It's why we have now made Iran's economy a shambles.\"\n\nThe administration thinks the Iranian economy could shrink by 10 to 12% in the next year, he said, adding that, \"It denies their capability to work on their missile program.\"\n\nStephanopoulos interjected, \"Isn't that what they're doing now?\"\n\nPompeo responded, \"The terror attacks around the world increased under the JCPOA, George,\" referring to the Iranian nuclear deal by its formal acronym. Because of the sanctions, he said, Hezbollah and Shia militias are \"struggling for resources.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo says President Trump is ready to meet with Iran's Rouhani \"with no preconditions,\" because \"we don't want war with Iran,\" but \"it's up to the Ayatollah to made the decision about the direction he wants to take his country\" https://t.co/4KgJD7LIz0 pic.twitter.com/zwrFYHDKxS \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 8, 2019\n\nHe also said that Trump wants to negotiate with the Iranian government and meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. But whether they will meet is up to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who, Pompeo said, will \"make the decision about the direction he wants to take his country.\"\n\nThe Iranian government is set to start work on centrifuges that would enrich uranium faster, according to reports from the state-run news agency on Friday. It's the most recent challenge of the terms of the nuclear deal.\n\nThe Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the deal last May.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/pompeo-03-as-gty-190907_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
