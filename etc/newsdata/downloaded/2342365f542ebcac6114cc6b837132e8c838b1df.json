will the world's next Zika, West Nile or dengue come from?", "language": "en", "text": "The study looked at viruses which are spread by mosquitoes and ticks\n\nAnd West Nile Virus is the most likely one to affect North America\n\nIn Western Europe the most likely virus to break out is Japanese encephalitis\n\nThey worked out which creatures are most likely to carry certain flaviviruses\n\nResearchers analysed all known animal and bird species in the world\n\nThe countries most likely to be responsible an outbreak of a contagious killer virus such as Zika or dengue have been revealed by scientists.\n\nResearchers have created heat maps to show viral hot-spots around the world, by working out which animals are most likely to spread illnesses and where.\n\nThe maps show where existing flaviviruses \u2013 infectious viruses spread mostly by mosquitoes and ticks \u2013 or similar new ones are most likely to surface and spread in the future.\n\nFor example, Japanese encephalitis is most likely to break out in Western Europe, while the West Nile Virus is a major threat in North America.\n\nInformation about thousands of bird and mammal species was involved in the study and researchers say it will help predict and track viruses around the world.\n\nScientists from the University of California, Davis, have examined animal and bird species data to figure out where they think the next virus outbreaks could happen \u2013 they decided West Nile Virus is most likely to affect North America, dengue South America, Japanese encephalitis Western Europe and yellow fever or Zika south-east Asia\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Davis, have charted where they think future outbreaks of known viruses or similar strains will happen.\n\nViruses such as Zika, dengue and West Nile tend to be transmitted to people \u2013 at least in the first instance \u2013 from warm-blooded animals via mosquitoes.\n\nScientists have compared information about every known bird and mammal species on earth to work out which ones carry different types of viruses.\n\nWorking out where animals are most likely to be affected by certain viruses can provide clues about where they are most likely to take hold and spread to people.\n\nThey found Zika and yellow fever are most likely to break out in south-east Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, with other hot-spots in Europe and Africa.\n\nPeople are at highest risk of West Nile Virus in the US, Mexico and the south of Canada, with a lower but not absent risk across Europe and Russia.\n\nThe St Louis encephalitis and Usutu viruses are also likely to be found in the same areas, the study found.\n\nDengue, which is common and can cause fever, vomiting and rashes, is most likely to break out in South America in Brazil and surrounding countries.\n\nYellow fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV) or similar viruses are most likely to break out in south-east Asia (red and orange), with some risk areas in Africa, Europe and South America (yellow)\n\nWest Nile Virus (WNV), St Louis encephalitis (SLEV) and Usutu (USUV) are all most likely to affect North America, according to the study, with some risk in eastern Europe and Russia as well\n\nTick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), an infection which can damage people's brains, is most likely to surface in Russia and northern Europe, researchers showed\n\nAccording to the research, Western Europe is most at risk of an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis, a brain infection found in pigs which can cause seizures, paralysis and even death in severe cases in humans.\n\nTick-borne encephalitis, another brain infection, is also most likely to break out in Europe, though further to the east and into Russia.\n\nWhen flaviviruses infect people they often cause fevers, headaches, tiredness and rashes, muscle or joint pain and some cause nausea or vomiting.\n\nMost people only suffer mild illness and recover quickly but complications can be life-threatening.\n\nLess well-known viruses Rio Bravo, Entebbe bat and Dakar bat \u2013 the latter of which are both carried by bats \u2013 are also most likely to be found in South America.\n\n'If there's an outbreak anywhere in the world tomorrow, we now know which wildlife species are most likely to be infected in addition to humans,' said lead author Pranav Pandit.\n\nRio Bravo virus (RBV), Entebbe bat virus (ENTV) and Dakar bat virus (DBV) are all most likely to be found in South America in Brazil and the surrounding countries, the study found\n\nDengue, an infection common in tropical countries, is also most likely to break out in South America, according to the study based on the types of animals living there\n\nJapanese encephalitis (JEV) is most likely to spread among animals and birds in northern and western Europe, the University of California scientists said\n\nWHAT IS MOST LIKELY TO CAUSE THE NEXT EPIDEMIC? In February 2018, The World Health Organization released its annual list of lethal bugs that they warned there is an 'urgent' need to accelerate research into. The ones that they prioritised were: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\n\nEbola\n\nMarburg virus disease\n\nLassa fever\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\n\nNipah and henipaviral diseases\n\nRift Valley fever (RVF)\n\nZika\n\nDisease X\n\nAround 10,400 bird species and 5,400 mammals were included in the study to work out which were most likely to host contagious diseases.\n\nSome animals identified as potential carriers were associated with viruses for the first time.\n\nFor example, 139 new hosts for dengue were discovered among the 173 species the study predicted could carry the virus.\n\nResearchers said the knowledge will be useful for tracking the spread of viruses among animals, because testing for flaviviruses can be difficult.\n\nIf they target the correct species they can now test for diseases using non-invasive methods like taking saliva samples from sticks chewed by primates, for example.\n\nCo-author, Professor Christine Kreuder Johnson added: 'We needed this modeling technique to help us understand the most likely hosts for these viruses in their natural habitat.\n\n'That's important for both global health and wildlife conservation.'\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Communications.", "description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have studied thousands of species of animals and birds to work out where reservoirs of contagious, mosquito-borne viruses could be.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/16/8230958-0-image-a-14_1546878537564.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-07"}
