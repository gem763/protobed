It\u2019s indisputable that Hunter Biden\u2019s board seat on Burisma was unsavory at best. It\u2019s also indisputable that Biden pressured Ukraine\u2019s then-president Petro Poroshenko to dismiss Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin over his handling of corruption investigations. One of these investigations was a probe into Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma. McCarthy\u2019s juxtaposition of these facts might lead a reader to conclude that Biden used his position as vice president to undermine an investigation that could affect his son. That would be profoundly troubling if it were true.\n\nBut all of the available context points in the other direction. The Obama administration\u2019s problem with Shokin wasn\u2019t that he was going too hard on oligarchs like Zlochevsky; it was that he was going too easy on them, often by slow-walking and shelving anti-corruption cases. What\u2019s more, Biden and the Obama administration weren\u2019t alone in criticizing how Shokin handled those cases. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund also urged Kiev to oust him, as did Ukrainian anti-corruption activists and reformers. So did three Republican senators, who signed a letter in 2016 that urged Ukraine\u2019s president to reform the prosecutor general\u2019s office. Poroshenko and other top Ukrainian officials have disputed Trump\u2019s narrative and said Biden never discussed specific cases with them.\n\nMcCarthy also tries to normalize Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine. \u201cTo listen to commentary, not only by anti-Trumpers, but even some Trump defenders who don\u2019t seem to understand what they\u2019re talking about, one would think that a quid pro quo is always bad, and that it is a terrible thing to pressure a foreign government,\u201d he wrote. He argues that what Trump\u2019s opponents describe as a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d is actually just bargaining in American foreign relations, and that the alleged \u201cextortion\u201d is just a form of diplomatic pressure that one government applies to another. Trump\u2019s actions, clumsy as they may be, are reimagined as statecraft in McCarthy\u2019s retelling.\n\nThere\u2019s a kernel of truth here. Presidents often seek things from foreign powers and offer them things in exchange. The U.S. government also uses a variety of soft-power and hard-power tools to pressure other countries into taking actions they would prefer. This is Foreign Relations 101. What sets Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings apart is not the means by which they were undertaken, but the underlying rationale that guided them. In democratic countries like the United States, presidents aren\u2019t supposed to advance their personal interests when conducting foreign relations, but rather a policy agenda that benefits the country as a whole.\n\nMcCarthy muddles that line between Trump\u2019s personal interests and his policy agenda. \u201cPresidents are in charge of foreign relations, and they pursue policies that they\u2019ve run on,\u201d he argues. \u201cPresidents seeking reelection need policy successes. A president\u2019s management of foreign policy and his political interests naturally overlap. At the same time, a policy that is good for the United States may have the collateral effect of politically damaging a president\u2019s political rival. A president should not be discouraged from pursuing American interests just because doing so might help the president or harm the president\u2019s opposition.\u201d", "description": "Standing athwart history, sighing \"Whatever.\"", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/74b27cad33f4a08d76c378f7b01c2130632d497a.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
