Rouhani said Iran was already committed to both.\n\nHe also said the plan required the United States stop all sanctions and allow oil trade, starting immediately.\n\n[Trump says he has ordered a substantial increase in sanctions against Iran]\n\nThe Politico report, citing French officials, said that although the U.S. and Iranian presidents agreed on the French plan, the two leaders did not meet after Rouhani insisted that Trump first give an indication that the United States would lift sanctions on Iran.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s attempt to then set up a phone call between Rouhani and Trump failed after Rouhani declined to participate, the report said.\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday, Rouhani did not say whether he had insisted on a sign from Trump that sanctions would be lifted, and he did not mention the canceled phone call.\n\n\u201cMany might think that the New York talks were a solution, but they weren\u2019t,\u201d Rouhani said. \u201cThe solution of such an important matter cannot be achieved in such a short time and without studying all its aspects and the way they wanted to abuse it at that point of time.\u201d\n\nHe also said that while U.S. officials were telling the Europeans in private calls that they are ready for negotiations, they were saying in interviews that they were going to tighten sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cI turned to Macron and told him, \u2018Shall I believe you, or shall I believe the U.S. president who is tightening the sanctions on my country?\u2019\u201d Rouhani said.\n\nTehran accepts the main framework of the plan \u2014 \u201cwith some minor changes in the terms and vocabulary,\u201d he added.\n\nA 2015 nuclear agreement, negotiated during the Obama administration between Iran and six world powers including the United States, said in its first paragraph: \u201cIran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.\u201d Trump withdrew the United States from the accord last year and reimposed tough U.S. sanctions that had been lifted in return for the deal\u2019s restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Iranian supreme leader, said Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy against Iran has failed.\n\nThe Americans \u201chave recently had a failed attempt with the help of their European friends to have a meeting with our president and put on a show of Iran\u2019s defeat,\u201d he said during a meeting with members of the High Council of the Commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\n\u201cThey failed so far, and this policy will fail forever,\u201d Khamenei said.\n\nLast month, Trump announced that he had ordered a substantial increase in sanctions on Iran after it warned the United States that it would retaliate against any attacks.\n\nTehran and Washington have been embroiled in a standoff following a devastating attack on a Saudi oil facility that severely affected the country\u2019s oil production.\n\nRead more:\n\nPompeo calls attacks on Saudi oil facilities \u2018act of war\u2019\n\nIran sentences man to death on charges of spying for CIA\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "France presented a four-point plan as a basis to reboot talks and reduce soaring tensions.", "authors": ["Sarah Dadouch", "Correspondent Covering The Middle East", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X4Pj1I5F8t8IDYSU4yBABdROEj4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TWPSPHHE7QI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg"}
