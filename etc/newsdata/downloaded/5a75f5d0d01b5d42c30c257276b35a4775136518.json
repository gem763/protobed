But contrary to some speculation, she said the decision wasn\u2019t premeditated, since the reservation was made under Sanders\u2019s husband\u2019s name and the staff didn\u2019t recognize it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis was not a considered thing. This was not something we planned to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t intend to become the resistance restaurant.\u201d\n\nSince then, the Red Hen has been visited by sympathetic Washington VIPs, Wilkinson said, in a show of support, although she wouldn\u2019t name names. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, and very low-key.\u201d\n\nWilkinson appeared on Monday alongside a handful of Washington restaurant owners and managers convened by Washington journalist (and former restaurateur) Carol Joynt to discuss the increasingly fraught intersection of dining and politics.\n\nThe restaurant owners described a new era in which the city\u2019s dining rooms have become political stages, one where protesters, active shooters and suspicious backpacks now figure into their concerns alongside the specials of the day and overflowing reservation books. Long gone, they said, is the old idea that politics stopped at the water\u2019s edge of dinnertime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new era, it\u2019s a new time,\u201d said Laurent Menoud, the general manager of Cafe Milano, whose clientele reads like a lineup of Sunday-morning talk show guests \u2014 and includes VIPs from both sides of the aisle. \u201cYou have to be very careful.\u201d\n\nHis own restaurant was targeted in 2011, when an alleged plot by the Iranian government to assassinate Saudi Arabia\u2019s U.S. ambassador included bombing the Georgetown restaurant. Milano now sometimes hires plainclothes security agents to mix in, undetected, with guests, he says, and the staff has been trained to be vigilant about suspicious behavior of guests, including those wearing coats in summer or carrying backpacks.\n\nSeveral restaurants represented on the panel, including Milano, have been contacted by the FBI about possible threats and with offers to conduct training for their staff. Maria Trabocchi, who owns six restaurants with her husband, Fabio Trabocchi, said the threat levels go up and down depending on global events, visits by dignitaries, or other factors. \u201cThere are times when it is more \u2018hot\u2019 around the city or in the world, so they\u2019ll come in and do a reminder,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRuth Gresser, the owner of Pizzeria Paradiso, said she had active-shooting training for her staff before Trump\u2019s inauguration. She said she feared her company might be a target for the Trump supporters flocking to Washington, either because of its \u201cprogressive\u201d reputation, the fact that she is an out lesbian, and because her restaurants are pizzerias, which took on a frightening meaning after the development of the debunked \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory. That viral theory, which fomented among members of the right-wing fringe groups on Reddit and social media, posited falsely that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, used code words, including pizza, in emails that actually described the operation of a human-trafficking and child-sex ring. One adherent to that bizarre belief traveled to Washington to investigate and fired shots inside Comet Ping Pong in the Chevy Chase neighborhood of Washington.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of things that potentially made my organization a target,\u201d Gresser said.\n\nAnd although the restaurateurs had similar stories, they offered differing visions of whether politics has any place in a restaurant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s always welcome,\u201d said Trabocchi, whose restaurant Fiola was in the news when protesters confronted Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) there while he was dining with his wife. \u201cPeople complain. They\u2019re like, \u2018How can you serve them?\u2019 Everyone\u2019s got to eat, and our mission and our job is to be hospitable.\u201d\n\nBut for some, that hospitality might have limits.\n\nIn the District of Columbia, it\u2019s illegal for a restaurant to discriminate against customers based on their political affiliation. Still, Gresser described her company as having a \u201csocial justice presence.\u201d \u201cRestaurants are becoming community centers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we have had to learn is how to do what we do \u2014 which is to feed and take care of people \u2014 and do it in a broader world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have almost an obligation to participate in this larger community,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAnd while Wilkinson said she wouldn\u2019t want the restaurant world to be divided into Republican and Democratic establishments, she said there are times that a restaurant owner can\u2019t stay neutral. \u201cOur world is turning toward a place that obliges us to stand up for some sorts of \u2026 conscience things we have to stand behind,\u201d she said.\n\nMore from Food:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington restaurateurs share what happens when politics comes to dine in their establishments.", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Food Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uKRzwzTHnYSCO1-HYmvMZyN5yWY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3F7PNO3H4M56TKYQG5EXCBM7UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
