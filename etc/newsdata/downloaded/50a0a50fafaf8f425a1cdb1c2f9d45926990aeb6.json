Photo: MTV\n\nTen p.m. was fashionably too late to arrive on Monday night. The line for the finale viewing party of MTV\u2019s Are You the One was already snaking down the street in front of the Deep End, a bar in Ridgewood where several of this season\u2019s cast members were hosting a live screening. \u201cMadison,\u201d I heard someone shout. It was a friend and former New York colleague, Claire, waving us over to join her group. Sometimes the New York queer community feels suffocatingly small, and other times, like last night, its size is a real gift.\n\nAre You the One just wrapped its eighth season. The show brings together an even-numbered group of people (this season had 16) and puts them in a house. Each person in the house has a designated \u201cperfect match\u201d within the group, and the contestants have to figure out the right combination of pairings over the course of weekly match ceremonies to win a prize of $1 million, which gets divided among the group. Each week, those ceremonies use spotlights (or as the show calls them \u201cbeams\u201d) to designate how many matches the group got right. Helpful, but not entirely, because the beams do not indicate which of the pairs the lights represent. (There are also mechanisms built into the show to make it harder. If there\u2019s a week the group gets no matches correct they lose a quarter of a million dollars.) In past seasons, the group was evenly divided by a gender binary and all pairs were heterosexual. This season, everybody was sexually fluid, making the math harder because each person could potentially be a match with any other of their castmates.\n\nI joined Claire and our conversation quickly turned to astrology. She had a list of all the AYTO cast members\u2019 signs and was using it to predict their fates. Later, another attendee told me, \u201cThis entire season all I wanted to do was know everyone\u2019s sign to the point where I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is a queer season because they haven\u2019t televised any of that [astrology].\u2019\u201d I told her about Claire\u2019s list. \u201cOh, yeah, I found them on Reddit,\u201d she said.\n\nI talked to a group of four behind me in line. Kaitlelyn, 22, and Noelle, 21, identify as bi. Their other two friends, AJ and Simone, shrugged at the notion of labels. AJ said they had never watched a season of the show before this one, \u201cI liked the representation this time,\u201d they said. \u201cAnd the chaos.\u201d As we waited, Basit, a gender nonconforming cast member and one of the party\u2019s hosts, appeared in drag as Dionne Slay. She strutted by in a bedazzled catsuit and a barrette that read \u201cGLAM\u201d clipped onto a flowing brown wig, and cheers rippled down the line. Later, two other cast members, Justin and Kari, appeared in matching neon-pink ensembles. The two might be a perfect match, but people seemed to think the coordination was a red herring.\n\nBasit\u2019s midseason reveal of Dionne Slay, during a queer-prom-themed episode, is what drew Faquan, a 25-year-old security guard wearing a \u201cthe queer is strong with this one\u201d shirt. (They also said their name is spelled with a \u201cq as in queen.\u201d) \u201cI wish the show had showed even more,\u201d they said. \u201cHave you seen Big Brother? It would have been great to see a 24-hour livecast.\u201d As the night went on, increasingly drunk cast members revealed plenty that was left on the cutting-room floor.\n\nIf you squint, you can see season eight contestants Justin, Kari, Basit, Kylie, and Nour onstage at the Deep End in this extremely high-quality photograph.

I handed $10 to a bouncer who stamped my wrist with a pig. The place was packed with queer folks. It\u2019s like Christmas in July, except it\u2019s Pride in September. A rainbow flag hung next to the stage where the show was being projected. Remy, this season\u2019s early front-runner for villain who turned out to be a big ol\u2019 softie, squeaked by me. Something had gone wrong with the tech in the overflow room and he was headed there to assess the situation. A muted commercial played while some of the cast members, led by Basit, riffed and spilled tea. \u201cGuess what we ate on the show? Guess what they fed us?\u201d Basit asked the crowd. \u201cAlcohol,\u201d somebody shouted. Basit nodded. \u201cPanda Express,\u201d Paige, another cast member, mouthed into a mic. She started to tell a story about a sixsome that never aired. \u201cWee-woo, wee-woo,\u201d Basit wailed. \u201cI\u2019m the MTV police here to stop you right there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you doing math?\u201d someone asked, spying my notebook. The thing about ATYO is it\u2019s basically a show about probability. To my right, someone was perusing a spreadsheet of possible outcomes on their phone from a blog called, aptly, \u201cAre You the One Math.\u201d This season, the contestants took a while to figure anything out but eventually started to crunch the numbers. (Shouts to Kari and Danny, the human calculators of the group.) On the screen, the group sends Kylie and Amber to the \u201cTruth Booth,\u201d a game mechanism that allows the group to confirm definitively if a couple is a perfect match. (One couple per week is allowed to enter the booth, but only after winning a challenge.) Kylie and Amber are not each others\u2019 match. \u201cMy asshole was in my pants [while in the booth],\u201d Kylie said onstage. Basit laughed and asked her where else it would have been.\n\nA blurry Paige.\n\nDespite the hot and packed space, the crowd was friendly. I met Lauren, a web developer for a sex-toy company, who promptly offered me a discount code. Kendall, a woman standing behind me with her girlfriend, Zoe, said, \u201cHe sucks, but he\u2019s right.\u201d She was talking about Max, a cast member who spent a number of weeks chasing another player named Justin, even as it became increasingly clear they weren\u2019t a match. Now, by the final episode, Max is convinced \u2014 correctly \u2014 his match is Kari, a cast member he\u2019d had seemingly no chemistry with in prior episodes. Zoe and I got to chatting and, because the world is incredibly tiny, discovered she was in a sorority with a mutual friend. I told her my college sorority was pretty straight. \u201cOh no. Ours was a lot of sisters hooking up,\u201d she said. I tried to compliment a person to my left on their Euphoria-esque glitter eyeliner, but I was bumped out of the way by another person wearing camo coveralls and no shirt.\n\n\u201cDo math!\u201d somebody yelled at the screen as the episode started to wind down and the final match ceremony began. \u201cEverybody here is about that queer party life,\u201d Basit yelled into the crowd, urging us to stay after the episode and celebrate until the bar shuts down at 4 a.m. \u201cWe\u2019re about that queer bedtime,\u201d my girlfriend muttered. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to lose. It\u2019s canon. We [queer people] lose. We get killed off,\u201d Kendall joked. In the show\u2019s previous seven seasons, only one cast was unable to make all the matches and lost, winning no prize money at all. (This season\u2019s cast is playing for $750,000, after a blackout \u2014 a beamless match ceremony \u2014 in episode six.)\n\nThe beams at a match ceremony. Photo: MTV\n\nThe crowd was a sea of raised phones, filming as the sixth beam lights up. The whole game hangs on Amber, who chooses Remy, despite a clear physical attraction to Justin. \u201cThis is for the queers,\u201d Jenna, another castmate, says on the screen, as they await the fateful seventh beam. Seven beams also means eight beams. Which means a win. After a dramatic pause, the beam glows. The crowd erupted. Basit, IRL, raised a toast to \u201ccelebrate us being queer people who win.\u201d Paige, whose perfect match was Jenna, grabbed the microphone from them. \u201cRemy\u2019s been my boyfriend the entire time,\u201d she shouted. The crowd screamed louder. The couple has been living together in the East Village since the show wrapped. (A poorly kept secret, a person named Chris tells me. He spotted the two looking cozy at an Unter party earlier this month.) \u201cIt\u2019s a rent-controlled two bedroom,\u201d Remy, a lifelong New Yorker, said, and a woman nearby asked if she and her partner could move in, too.\n\n\u201cI have an early bedtime, can we get a picture,\u201d someone asked Remy as they headed for the exit. It was 12:15 a.m., and Remy was telling me about all the sex that didn\u2019t get aired. \u201cI fucked Danny on night one,\u201d he said. The finale had a shot of Amber and Justin hooking up in the \u201cBoom Boom Room.\u201d It was actually a threesome, he said \u2014 he just got edited out of the scene. A woman named Paloma, sporting dangling earrings that spell \u201cSEXY\u201d in rhinestones, made her way to the stage to talk to Paige. She\u2019s 24 and new to the city. This is her first time out alone, she said. \u201cI was ready to be guarded about how they\u2019d be talking about identities on the show but it felt very mature,\u201d she said of this season. \u201cEnough education for people that aren\u2019t in the community but also it wasn\u2019t like, \u2018These are gay terms 101,\u2019 or \u2018Here\u2019s what tea means.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI went for a girlfriend and I left with a boyfriend,\u201d Paige said when we reached the stage. \u201cWe\u2019re monogamous but he understands that I just came out \u2026 it\u2019s all about communication.\u201d (Paige came out for the first time in the season premiere, an experience she called \u201chumbling.\u201d) After the episode, Kari also grabbed the mic to tell a story, \u201cbut you\u2019ll have to subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want to know what happened.\u201d \u201cI wish I\u2019d had a show like this when I was 12,\u201d she told me later. \u201cGrowing up [as a queer person of color] it would have been so wonderful to have a show like this make me feel \u2018normal,\u2019\u201d Justin echoed. \u201cTo let me know my experiences were valid.\u201d\n\nAs we headed out, I spotted Dionne Slay in the overflow room in the back of the bar. There were too many people surrounding her to get close, but she was dancing to \u201cGreedy\u201d by Ariana Grande, her sparkling outfit reflecting light onto the crowd as she spins.\n\nEveryone in this piece is addressed with gender neutral pronouns unless they indicated otherwise.", "description": "Contestants from the first-ever sexually fluid season of MTV\u2019s Are You The One threw a finale watch part in Queens on Monday night.
