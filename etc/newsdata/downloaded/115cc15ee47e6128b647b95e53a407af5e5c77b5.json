He said the aircraft traveled \"very low and very fast,\" took an hour and 10 minutes, crossed territory held by Russia, and encountered enemy fire. The team, he said, took the \"identical route\" back.\n\nTrump and President Barack Obama in their respective Situation Room photos. Shealah Craighead; Pete Souza\n\nSome national security officials have expressed concern that Trump's vivid description of the raid may have revealed too much \u2014 handing terrorists targeted by the US valuable information on evading capture or death.\n\nMichael Leiter, who was director of the US National Counterterrorism Center when Osama bin Laden was killed by US special operations forces in 2011, discussed the issue with Vox on Sunday.\n\n\"Talking about how many aircraft, where the aircraft are flying in, how they're breaching a building, other technology they can bring to bear, knowledge about the tunnels and the mapping of those tunnels, these are operational details which are only about preening,\" Leiter said.\n\nAnd speaking with Politico, current and former military officials and special operations commanders questioned the commander-in-chief's decision to describe details of the raid.\n\nThey said the president provided clues on how al-Baghdadi was located, specific details on the network of tunnels into which he fled, and information about how they accessed the building.\n\nThey questioned why he revealed that US special forces took time after the assassination gathering intelligence, ultimately staying at the site for two hours.\n\n\"There's no reason to reveal that,\" a former special operations commander told the publication.\n\n\"You're giving them another way to think about how long forces on the ground are vulnerable. Timing on an objective is something where you never want the bad guys to know what your procedure was or how long it took.\"\n\nTrump has faced criticism in the past for disclosing highly sensitive information on military and intelligence operations. In August he tweeted a highly detailed picture of an Iranian rocket-launch site that experts said had most likely been included in his classified intelligence briefing.\n\nThe theatrical manner of Trump's announcement of al-Baghdadi's death differed from the measured announcement of bin Laden's death delivered by President Barack Obama in 2011.\n\nBut the criticisms they received in the wake of the announcements haven't been so different. Obama administration officials were censured by some at the time as revealing too much about the raid on the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.\n\nPeter King, then chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called for an inquiry to be launched after it was revealed that Obama administration officials had briefed the film director Kathryn Bigelow for her film \"Zero Dark Thirty\" about the hunt for bin Laden.\n\nThere will always be a tension between a president's desire to gain political credit for a successful, high-profile operation and the desire of US military forces to cloak such operations in secrecy.\n\nAnd some officials defended Trump, saying he was in fact deliberately vague about operational details that could compromise future raids.\n\n\"There's always a risk in saying too much,\" Robert Spalding, an Air Force general who served on Trump's National Security Council, told The Washington Post.\n\n\"But the thing I liked was, there were no pictures, there was no specification of types of aircraft used. Everything I saw in terms of what was released was quite vague.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump described specific details of the US operation in which the ISIS leader was killed \u2014 and some officials say he went too far.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6cde7dee01929bb430033?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
