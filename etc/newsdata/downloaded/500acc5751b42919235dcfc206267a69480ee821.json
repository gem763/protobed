We all saw the second half was calmer and that allowed our players to do their talking with the football.\u201d\n\nMost of the Bulgaria players and coach Krasimir Balakov said they had not heard any abuse of the England team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate subject,\u201d Balakov told reporters. \u201cI do not think there is a single person in Bulgaria who would say that racism is something pleasant.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, it is very strange how this topic is interpreted in football. I have heard absolutely nothing (during the game).\u201d\n\nOn the pitch, Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling both netted twice after Marcus Rashford got the opener and captain Harry Kane finished off the rout, Bulgaria\u2019s heaviest home defeat, as the visitors recovered from a 2-1 loss to the Czech Republic on Friday.\n\nEngland, who moved closer to a place at Euro 2020, are top of the group with 15 points from six games, three ahead of the Czechs and four in front of Kosovo who beat Montenegro 2-0.\n\nEARLY VICTIM\n\nEngland debutant Tyrone Mings was an early victim of racist abuse, turning towards the fans when chants were aimed in his direction. Croatian referee Ivan Bebek stopped the game in the 28th minute after Raheem Sterling was a target for abuse.\n\nA public announcement condemned the racist abuse before stating that the match would be abandoned if it continued.\n\nThe game was stopped again in the 43rd minute but resumed after the referee consulted England manager Gareth Southgate.\n\nA group of black-clad Bulgarian fans, some of whom were making right-wing salutes, were moved from an area behind the dugout with home team captain Ivelin Popov trying to appeal to the supporters in a heated discussion at halftime.\n\nPopov did not even go to the dressing room, attempting to explain to fans that their behaviour was unacceptable.\n\nEuropean soccer governing body UEFA had ordered the Bulgarian Football Union to partially close the Vasil Levski national stadium for England\u2019s visit after supporters were found guilty of racist behaviour in matches earlier this year.\n\nOn the pitch, Barkley struck twice after Rashford score in the seventh minute as Southgate\u2019s side highlighted the gap in quality with the hosts before Sterling netted before halftime.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\nEngland\u2019s victory was rounded off by Sterling\u2019s second goal midway through the second half and a cool finish from Kane five minutes from the end against bottom side Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cWe have no class,\u201d coach Krasimir Balakov said of his side. \u201cI understand all the people who have bought tickets and wanted something different, but against this England team, with this dynamic, and with these players that cost millions...\u201d .", "description": "England bounced back from their first tournament qualifying defeat for 10 years with a 6-0 thrashing of toothless Bulgaria on Monday in a Euro 2020 Group A clash marred by racist incidents in the first half that stopped the game.", "authors": ["Angel Krasimirov", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440852264&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1SD", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
