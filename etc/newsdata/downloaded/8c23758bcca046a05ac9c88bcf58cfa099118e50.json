The surgeon has been popular among fans, with one of her most notable storylines being her romance with Bernie, which won a huge following among the viewership until the couple was broken up in a devastating series of events.\n\nOther major storylines have included Serena\u2019s raw grief over the tragic loss of her daughter Elinor, which won Catherine huge critical acclaim over her harrowing performances.\n\nSpeaking about her decision to step away from the role, Catherine said: \u2018Playing Serena Campbell and being part of the Holby family has been an absolute delight. I just need to get out there, frighten myself again and pretend to be someone else. But you never know, hopefully I\u2019ll be able to revisit the hospital as it really is the most wonderful place to work!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimon Harper, Executive Producer of Casualty and Holby City, says: \u2018Yes it\u2019s true, the brilliant Catherine Russell is leaving the show. She\u2019s truly one of the Holby greats, her mercurial portrayal of the unique, drily witty and passionate Serena literally lighting up the screen. We are all very sad to say goodbye to her \u2013 but it\u2019s no surprise such a talented actor should want to go and play other roles again after seven outstanding years. Catherine, we wish you all the best, while raising a bucket of shiraz to the glory that is Ms Campbell \u2013 and I just can\u2019t thank you enough.\u2019\n\nViewers can expect Serena\u2019s final weeks in Holby City to be packed with drama and a series of unexpected events. Fans will see a startlingly steely side when Serena faces a dark reminder from the past and then developments at the hospital will bring out her joyously rebellious side as she passionately fights for her family and her most cherished values.\n\nShe will bow out early next year, with Catherine having recently filmed her final scenes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "End of the line.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/serena-holby-42-180f_1572430575.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
