It was an event, booking was part of the whole experience.\"\n\nRoots in the railways\n\nAlthough it is now best known for its trips abroad, when cabinet-maker Thomas Cook founded the business in Leicestershire in 1841 it was for more local excursions.\n\nA former Baptist preacher, he wanted to offer working class people a form of educational entertainment to divert them from drinking which he saw as at the root of Victorian social ills.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Thomas Cook was 32 when he had the thought that railway trips could be used for social reform\n\nHe harnessed the UK's newly built railways to offer his first 12 mile trip from Leicester to Loughborough, at the cost of a shilling per head (around \u00a33 in today's money).\n\nThose travelling were so-called \"temperance supporters\" - supporting the prohibition of alcohol.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Around 500 passengers travelled on the first ever Thomas Cook excursion\n\nThe visit was such a success that Thomas Cook repeated it over several summers on behalf of Sunday schools which laid the foundations for the business.\n\nBrits abroad\n\nBy 1855, after having pioneered trips around the British Isles and to London's Great Exhibition, Thomas Cook set his sights across the Channel to Paris where the International Exhibition was being held.\n\nHis commercial tour there, linked to other European destinations, was a huge success.\n\nMore European trips followed, closely followed by America, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Early adverts for trips, including Liverpool to New York in 1866 for 25 Guineas, around \u00a31,552 in today's money\n\nThe company flourished, fuelled by the growing middle classes and their desire to travel.\n\nThomas' son, John Mason Cook, eventually took over running the company from his father, who died in 1892.\n\nIt stayed in family hands and, in the first quarter of the 20th Century, Thomas Cook's grandsons added winter sports, motor car tours and commercial air travel to its offerings.\n\nPackage holiday boom\n\nAt the end of the 1920s it changed hands for the first of many times when the grandsons unexpectedly sold the business to the Belgian owner of the Orient Express.\n\nBut as World War Two broke out, it was nationalised by the British government as part of British Railways, to save it from the Nazi occupation.\n\nThe post-war years were characterised by a holiday boom in the UK. For Thomas Cook, this meant taking holidaymakers on package holidays abroad but also to its Welsh holiday camp in Prestatyn.\n\n\"I see them as a pioneer in organised travel,\" says Ms Coulthurst, from holiday price comparison website TravelSupermarket, describing how people went on package holidays as children and later as adults with their own families.\n\n\"They were in all of the main package holiday destinations.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Going Places travel brand was part of the Thomas Cook group but was killed off\n\nBut competition from other businesses also grew.\n\nThomas Cook was taken private in the 1970s and expanded its network of High Street travel shops through a string of acquisitions.\n\nThen in 1992 it was bought by Germany's third largest bank, the Westdeutsche Landesbank.\n\nThomas Cook's airline business was founded in 1999.\n\nIts next owner in 2001 was another German company, C&N Touristic AG, which quickly rebranded the whole business as Thomas Cook. More acquisitions of shops and travel businesses continued across the world, including India.\n\nTravel revolution\n\nThrough its long history, it is the 21st Century that the company has found hardest to adapt to.\n\nThe digital age has seen a revolution in travel. The internet and the rise of budget airlines have made holidays cheaper and more accessible than ever before.\n\nThe package holiday remained popular, but customers are extremely price sensitive - and Thomas Cook's profit margins were slim.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Thomas Cook brand expanded all over the world, including in India\n\nIts history left it with expensive overheads - hundreds of shops and thousands of staff.\n\nAcquisitions left it with high debt levels, and little ability to respond to the headwinds of the travel market. Hurricanes, heatwaves and currency fluctuations have hit the company hard over the last few years.\n\n\"I think the reasons are very complex,\" says Amie Keeley, the head of news at Travel Weekly.\n\nShe cites some \"questionable decisions\" years ago, when the company was under a different management and decided to expand its shop network at a time when more people were going online.\n\n\"In the short term, last summer's extended heatwave was a big reason. And they have also cited Brexit saying consumers are less confident,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Thomas Cook offered a complete holiday \"package\" of travel, accommodation and food in 1855\n\nMs Coulthurst says UK travellers are still booking package holidays, which gives them financial protection through the government-run Atol scheme.\n\n\"However a lot of them are booking them in different ways now,\" she adds.\n\n\"Thomas Cook has 560 travel agents on the high street, it used to have more. That's bricks and mortar, they have overheads.\"\n\nShe says Thomas Cook was left competing with low-cost airlines as well as rivals with a big online presence, and says: \"But [Thomas Cook's] online presence isn't as strong. They are seen as a predominantly high street shop business.\"\n\nShe also says in North Africa - where Thomas Cook has an \"extremely strong package holiday presence\" - there has been political unrest, such as the ban on flights to Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh, which has affected the tour operator.\n\nMuch-loved brand\n\nBut Thomas Cook has retained a dedicated following, taking 19 million people from the UK and other countries on holiday each year.\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\n\"It's an iconic travel brand that has been in existence for 178 years,\" says Ms Keeley from Travel Weekly, adding it is \"much-loved\" both by consumers and those in the travel industry.\n\nEven the company's competitors did not want to see Thomas Cook collapse, she adds, not just because of the wider impact on the industry but also from an \"emotional and heritage point of view\".\n\n\"A lot of people have worked for Thomas Cook or work with them, so everyone is rooting for them.\"\n\nFor its loyal customers and for its 22,000 staff members, the company has stayed true to its roots - democratising travel and in the words of Thomas Cook himself making it \"a social idea\".", "description": "The travel operator, which has collapsed after 178 years, began with a train trip from Leicester.", "authors": ["Katie Prescott", "Francesca Gillett", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F32A/production/_108905226_gettyimages-2216898.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
