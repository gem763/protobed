The key will be how it navigates the treacherous waters of identity politics. There's no doubt: the party's future is under threat, writes Pieter du Toit.\n\nIn the end there was nowhere to go for Mmusi Maimane, who resigned as leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHe had been pummeled from all sides since the party\u2019s election return in May, and a damning report into internal party failings \u2013 coupled with the return of Helen Zille to the leadership this past weekend \u2013 saw his position dramatically weaken within the space of 72 hours.\n\nThe party has undoubtedly been thrown into deep crisis and is entering unchartered terrain.\n\nThe resignation of a party leader is unprecedented, and the only other comparable situation is the equally dramatic departure of Frederik van Zyl Slabbert as leader of the DA\u2019s political ancestor, the Progressive Federal Party, in 1985, because he too believed that his party was failing.\n\nAs Herman Mashaba did on Monday when he resigned his DA commission as mayor of Johannesburg, Maimane has detonated a bomb in his own party, attacking it and distancing himself from what it has set out to achieve.\n\nBy declaring to all and sundry that \u201cthe DA is not the vehicle best suited to take forward the vision of building one South Africa for all\u201d he declared null and void all his attempts, pontifications and statements over the years in which he defended the party as a non-racial home for all.\n\nHe has effectively recanted everything and delivered a strategic and very painful blow to the party\u2019s collective solar plexus.\n\nBy admitting that he failed, and that he doesn\u2019t believe the DA to be the place for non-racialism, he has given the DA\u2019s political opponents enough material to launch wave after wave of attack.\n\nWhereas the ANC and EFF\u2019s racial nationalist assaults on the DA could previously be warded off by Maimane\u2019s insistence that the DA is not a white enclave, in the world of South African identity politics, this will now be almost impossible to do.\n\nThe DA, Maimane said, is fake.\n\nMaimane\u2019s final act of revenge \u2013 he is expected to be sacked as parliamentary leader later on Thursday \u2013 is particularly damaging because he is the latest in a series of high-profile black leaders to depart the stage. He now joins Mashaba, Patricia de Lille, Lindiwe Mazibuko and to a lesser extent Mamphela Ramphele as a previously anointed black face of the party.\n\nThis will not go unnoticed and will be exploited to its fullest extent.\n\nAnd who will have to defend it? Zille.\n\nHer return to the DA was about one thing: to reverse the party\u2019s closer embrace of race as determinant of disadvantage, redress and opportunity. Under Maimane the DA adopted an ideologically flexible and pragmatic approach to race, more closely mirroring the governing ANC\u2019s philosophy. This was done in the hope to attract more black voters quicker.\n\nIt has however led to severe internal acrimony and policy uncertainty, which translated into May\u2019s poor showing in the general election.\n\nThere is no doubt that Zille has moved very quickly to reassert her influence in the party and that Maimane\u2019s resignation was helped along by her unsettling presence as chairperson of the federal council \u2013 albeit with demonstrable and sizeable support.\n\nAnd she will now proceed to build a campaign around a possible leader to succeed Maimane, someone committed to an unbending ideology of a strict \u2013 but presumably responsive \u2013 approach to race and redress.\n\nThe party\u2019s future will be determined by what happens in the next 48 hours.\n\nIf it fails to urgently resolve the interim leadership issue and is unable to effectively and clearly articulate why Maimane had to go it will continue haemorrhage support. Internal tracking polls, coupled with the hard numbers since the election, show it has failed to convince the black electorate and has lost significant numbers of white voters.\n\nIt should also, as a matter of urgency, formulate a clear and understandable policy around race and redress. The malaise in which the party finds itself in signals chaos, and voters and supporters are repelled by disorganisation and uncertainty.\n\nThe future of the DA, a party that purports to occupy the centre on South African political spectrum, is under severe threat.\n\nEnsuring its future will take a herculean effort of organisation and persuasion.\n\n- Du Toit is assistant editor for in-depth news.", "description": "The DA's future will be determined by what happens in the next 48 hours.
