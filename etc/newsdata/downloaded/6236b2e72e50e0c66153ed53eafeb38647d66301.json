But that was not material enough to cause too much of a concern,\" said ANZ's Goh.\n\n\"But we did have some improvement in industrial production. So that helped to offset some of the disappointment in the GDP numbers.\"\n\nChina's industrial output grew a better-than-expected 5.8% in September, faster than the 17-year-low posted in August. oil prices pressured the Malaysian ringgit , while fiscal and economic worries pulled down the Indian rupee INR=IN .
