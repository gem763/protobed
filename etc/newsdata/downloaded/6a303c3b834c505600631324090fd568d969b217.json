The young company is focused on a unique twist on virtual reality: In-car VR, to be experienced by a passenger while a vehicle is in motion.\n\nVR in cars might sound like a bit of a conflicted or risky proposition, but it actually makes a lot of sense once you understand more about Holoride\u2019s approach. TechCrunch took it for a spin at CES this year, and found that the technology\u2019s ability to match a car\u2019s movements to virtual immersive environment made for a surprisingly impressive experience.\n\nThe company has previously shown off underwater adventures, as well last a Marvel Avengers-themed story, but the one it\u2019s launching for the public is a \u2018Bride of Frankenstein\u2019 ride which will be on offer for free between October 14 and November 9 at Universal CityWalk in Hollywood. Per the news release describing the adventure, there are virtual monsters and obstacles to overcome, and all of it is mapped to the ride you take inside a new 2020 model year Ford Explorer SUV.\n\nThe narrative is created by Universal Monsters, the sub-brand of Universal focused on its stable of cinematic ghouls, and Holoride takes in driving data, including speed of the vehicle and steering info to match the VR experience to the actual trip the rider is on.\n\nThe Ford partnership is one of the reasons Audi spun out this particularly venture, since it stated when it announced the move that it was hoping to get Holoride in the backseat of vehicles from all automakers.\n\nThis first public service offering should provide crucial insight for the Holoride team regarding its eventual commercialization and deployment plans for the technology. VR in cars still seems like a niche use case, but it\u2019s possible it\u2019s the niche that helps VR find some kind of footing among more general population users who aren\u2019t likely to own their own headset at home.", "description": "Audi spin-out Holoride is launching to the general public for the first time, though a collaboration with Ford and Universal Pictures .
