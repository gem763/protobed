On Friday, Thomson will be praising the Facebook CEO as the two men share a stage in New York City.\n\nThe occasion is the launch of Facebook\u2019s news section, which will give users a way to scan headlines and read some news stories \u2014 and which will give some publishers, like News Corp, millions of dollars a year for making their journalism available to Facebook.\n\nThomson and his boss, News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch, have been insisting that Facebook and other tech platforms should pay them for access to their work. Now Zuckerberg is giving them what they want.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable turnaround for Zuckerberg, who as recently as May 2018 said he had no interest in paying publishers for the right to show their stories.\n\n\u201cWe should all be sending Robert Thomson and Rupert Murdoch thank you notes,\u201d says an executive at another publisher that\u2019s participating in the new initiative. Facebook\u2019s news program comes months after Apple launched a subscription news service, which shares revenue with publishers; results so far have been disappointing for both Apple and news publishers, according to industry sources.\n\nFacebook will roll out its news section Friday as an \u201calpha\u201d launch, available to a couple hundred thousand US users; it won\u2019t get a wider release for a few months. Facebook users who do get it will see a new icon at the bottom of their mobile app alongside other initiatives like its Marketplace classified sales section and its Facebook Watch video section.\n\nUsers who click on the icon will see headlines for a handful of top stories, selected by Facebook editors \u2014 from partners like the Wall Street Journal (which is owned by News Corp), Business Insider, and BuzzFeed \u2014 and a personalized selection of headlines selected by Facebook\u2019s algorithmic software. Clicking on those headlines will send users to the publishers\u2019 own sites, where Facebook users can read the entire story for free. And while sites with subscription-based business models will have to let Facebook users see individual articles without paying, they\u2019ll be able to keep their paywalls mostly intact: If you click on a Wall Street Journal article via Facebook\u2019s news section, you\u2019ll be able to read that one story, but if you click on a subsequent WSJ piece, you\u2019ll be asked to pay up.\n\nThe program isn\u2019t supposed to diminish the presence of news in Facebook\u2019s main Newsfeed, sources say. If your uncle shares a story about Donald Trump, you will probably still see it.\n\nZuckerberg first floated the idea for the news section dedicated to \u201chigh-quality journalism,\u201d and paying publishers for access to their stories, in April. In recent months, Facebook has been signing up publishers for the program, but it remains a work in progress.\n\nSources say Facebook doesn\u2019t have finalized deals with the Washington Post and the New York Times, for instance, but that it expects to have them by the time the program rolls out widely. (Update: The Washington Post is in, the Washington Post reports.)\n\nFacebook will pay some of its news partners as much as $3 million a year for three-year deals but doesn\u2019t intend to pay all of the publishers in the program. Publishers who don\u2019t get paid will have to be content having Facebook send them traffic and potential subscribers. (I\u2019ve asked executives at Vox Media, which owns this site, whether the company is participating in Facebook\u2019s program and haven\u2019t received a reply. But I don\u2019t believe my employer is taking part.)\n\nFacebook has tried various initiatives with news publishers in the past. In 2015, Facebook tried to get publishers to let the company host their articles on its own site in what was supposed to be a trade for advertising revenue. That program still exists, but there\u2019s no real enthusiasm for it. Since then, Facebook has also paid publishers directly for creating new products for the social network, like programming for its live video push and on-demand news shows for Facebook Watch.\n\nBut none of those programs have worked particularly well for publishers, and Facebook has frequently changed its mind about how it wants to work with people who produce news for a living. Its biggest pivot came in 2018, when it announced it should show its users more items shared by friends and family and less from professional publishers; publishers saw Facebook referral traffic drop dramatically after that.\n\nBy contrast, the program Zuckerberg is announcing Friday appears rather straightforward: Facebook will pay publishers for work they already make and then share to the platform, which means it is pure profit.\n\nWhich is what Thomson and Murdoch have been asking for in a series of public announcements and speeches for some time. \u201cIf Facebook wants to recognize \u2018trusted\u2019 publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies,\u201d Murdoch said in January 2018 press release. \u201cIt is certainly appropriate for Facebook to pay premium publishers and premium journalists for the reputational and experiential services they provide,\u201d Thomson said at an Italian media conference a few months later.\n\nThe pressure seems to have done the trick. Now, Thomson is praising Facebook and its founder. \u201cFacebook deserves credit for recognizing the principle of journalistic provenance,\u201d he said in a WSJ story this month announcing that his paper had linked up with Facebook. \u201cMark Zuckerberg seems personally and professionally committed to ensuring that high quality journalism has a viable, valued future.\u201d\n\nFacebook sources acknowledge that Friday\u2019s press event is a symbolic win for News Corp, but they bristle at the idea that they\u2019re launching the news program at Murdoch and Thomson\u2019s behest. \u201cWe just happen to have a need that we can satisfy in a way that makes sense for us,\u201d says one executive familiar with the program.\n\nWhat\u2019s unclear is what convinced Zuckerberg, who said Murdoch\u2019s proposal was a nonstarter at a May 2018 news conference. As I wrote then:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that makes sense,\u201d Zuckerberg said when asked about the proposal, floated by Murdoch and others over the last year, during a wide-ranging interview today. \u201cPeople come to Facebook primarily not to consume news but to communicate with people,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cThe way we can help out the most with that is by helping out with a business model that is profitable and sustainable for news organizations.\u201d\n\nFacebook sources say that advocates for the new program included Chris Cox, Zuckerberg\u2019s former lieutenant, who left the company in March; Campbell Brown, the former journalist who oversees Facebook\u2019s deals with news organizations; and Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s top public policy executive.\n\nBut Zuckerberg surprised some people in the company by publicly backing the proposal in April, via an interview with Mathias D\u00f6pfner, the CEO of German publisher Axel Springer. Since then, Zuckerberg has personally lobbied executives like New York Times CEO Mark Thompson to join up, sources say.\n\nZuckerberg may well see the program as a reasonable way to compensate publishers for work he thinks is important, even as his company competes against publishers \u2014 and almost always wins \u2014 in a battle for digital advertising dollars.\n\nBut it\u2019s also not a terrible time for the Facebook founder to shore up relationships with the press. Zuckerberg\u2019s New York appearance will come two days after a long visit to Capitol Hill, where 60 members of Congress spent hours taking a whack at him. Republicans and Democrats now use him and his company as short-hand for tech billionaires who need to be reined in, and regulators are lining up to do just that.\n\nFacebook is expected to generate $19 billion in profits this year. Call me biased, but spending a small fraction of that to please publishers seems like a decent investment.", "description": "News Corp\u2019s Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson wanted Mark Zuckerberg to pay up.
