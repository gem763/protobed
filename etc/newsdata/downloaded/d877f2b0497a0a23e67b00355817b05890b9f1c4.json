In his case, fibres in his optic nerve have been so badly damaged that the harm to his sight has been judged to be permanent.\n\nStudy links heavily processed foods to risk of earlier death Read more\n\nSpeaking anonymously, the teenager\u2019s mother said he could not find work and had had to abandon a college course in IT.\n\nShe said her son became a fussy eater when he was about seven and would only eat chips, crisps, sausages, processed ham and white bread.\n\n\u201cThe first we knew about it was when he began coming home from primary school with his packed lunch untouched,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI would make him nice sandwiches \u2013 and put an apple or other fruit in \u2013 and he wouldn\u2019t eat any of it. His teachers became concerned, too.\n\n\u201cHis brother and sister have never stopped eating. They love everything. He has always been skinny, so we had no weight concerns. You hear about junk food and obesity all the time \u2013 but he was as thin as a rake.\u201d\n\nThe family only realised something was seriously wrong when his hearing began going at the age of 14 \u2013 and his vision soon after.\n\nThe woman said: \u201cHis sight went downhill very fast \u2013 to the point where he is now legally blind.\n\n\u201cHe has no social life to speak of now. After leaving school he got into college to do a course in IT. But he had to give it up because he could not see or hear anything.\n\n\u201cHe would love a job, but he has not been able to find anything he can do. I had to quit my job in a pub. I now look after him full-time. He is taking vitamin supplements, but his diet is still pretty much the same.\n\n\u201cWhen he was having counselling we managed to start him on fruit smoothies. But he\u2019s gone off those now.\u201d\n\nThe boy suffers from an eating disorder called Arfid (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder). Sufferers become sensitive to the taste, texture, smell and appearance of certain types of food.\n\nHis mother, in her 40s, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it when we were told what had happened. We are told the damage is irreversible. It\u2019s been a nightmare.\n\n\u201cMy son would love a job where he can sit at a desk and be useful. His siblings are doing well. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe 19-year-old agreed for his case to be reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine to raise awareness.\n\nAt the age of 14, he was diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency and put on supplements, but he did not stick with the treatment or improve his poor diet.\n\nDr Denize Atan, who treated the teenager at Bristol Eye Hospital, said: \u201cHe had a daily portion of fries from the local fish and chip shop and snacked on Pringles, white bread, processed ham slices and sausage.\n\n\u201cHe explained this as an aversion to certain textures of food that he really could not tolerate, and so chips and crisps were really the only types of food that he wanted and felt that he could eat.\u201d\n\nAtan and her colleagues re-checked the young man\u2019s vitamin levels and found he was low in B12 as well as some other important vitamins and minerals. He was not over or underweight, but was severely malnourished.\n\nThe paper said it was well-known junk food increased the risk of poor cardiovascular health, obesity and cancer. But it warned not everyone realised that poor nutrition could also permanently damage the nervous system, particularly vision.", "description": "Doctors highlight plight of 19-year-old from Bristol to warn of hidden dangers of poor nutrition", "authors": ["Steven Morris", "Richard Vize", "Tom Berry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58e2bc0fd54789018824a10d0eb3930e68fa6de5/0_286_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=60a64da9f69f73feb9cf720eb9c3ad7c"}
