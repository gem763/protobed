But we should have been paying close attention since February 2014, when students and other citizens swarmed the streets of Kyiv, the capital, to protest the pro-Russian policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in what is now known as the \u201cRevolution of Dignity.\u201d\n\nMr. Yanukovych had rejected a trade agreement with the European Union and instead looked longingly toward Moscow. Desiring closer ties with the West and tired of government corruption, Ukrainian protesters forced Mr. Yanukovych to give up power and flee the country.\n\nRussia characterized the Revolution of Dignity as a putsch organized by American intelligence agents. Pro-Russian politicians in the Crimea, in southern Ukraine, rejected the revolution and decided to stop sending tax payments to Kyiv. Russian special forces descended into the region, seized key installations and later presided over a fraudulent referendum in which Crimean voters chose to become part of the Russian Federation.\n\nMeanwhile, ethnic Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine created the People\u2019s Republic of Luhansk and People\u2019s Republic of Donetsk. Backed by Moscow, the two \u201crepublics\u201d have merged and are now fighting the Ukrainian army with Russian weapons and, often, Russian soldiers. The front stretches for several hundred miles and is covered with a network of trenches reminiscent of World War I. An estimated 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled their homes and another 13,000 have been killed in the conflict.\n\nWith the war dragging on and corruption rampant in Kyiv, desperate Ukrainian voters earlier this year gave political novice Zelensky, a former comedian, an overwhelming (73 percent) mandate in the presidential election, hoping he can turn things around.\n\nMost Ukrainians I talked with were more offended by Mr. Zelensky\u2019s apparent kowtowing to President Trump than to President Trump\u2019s request for a \u201cfavor\u201d regarding presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son. Indeed, several of my students referred to him as \u201cMonica Zelensky,\u201d a reference to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s intern and paramour.\n\nThe typical Ukrainian would not quibble with Mr. Trump\u2019s boast that he\u2019s done much to help Ukraine, nor his complaint that the countries of Western Europe have failed to assist their neighbor. Indeed, the Trump administration has provided Ukraine with sophisticated weaponry, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, while the Obama administration sent only rations and less advanced equipment.\n\nThe Europeans have been pressing Mr. Zelensky to make peace with Russia by, in essence, accepting the loss of significant territory. Mr. Zelensky recently landed in hot water when he announced acceptance of the \u201cSteinmeier Formula\u201d for ending hostilities. Named for German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and advocated by France and Germany, the plan calls for local elections in the occupied territories and recognition of the disputed land as a \u201cspecial autonomous region.\u201d Mr. Zelensky asserts that elections will be held only after Russian troops withdraw from the occupied territories, an unlikely proposition at this juncture.\n\nUkrainians fear Mr. Zelensky is selling them out by agreeing to the plan, which has not been formalized on paper so the people can see what the arrangement really involves. I had several students originally from Donetsk, an industrial area in eastern Ukraine now occupied by Russians, lament that Mr. Zelensky and the Europe Union were writing them off.\n\nIn addition to the Russian occupation, Ukraine continues to be plagued by corruption. Lawyers I met with complained that the key to a successful legal practice has little to do with legal acumen and more to do with knowing who to bribe. Judges I interviewed were glum about the matter, suggesting that corruption is so systemic it will take years to defeat.\n\nUkrainians are certainly aware of the goings on in Washington, the impeachment proceedings and their country\u2019s place in the American political spotlight. But they\u2019re focused on more important issues, such as the occupation of their territory by an aggressive neighbor, the economic distress caused by the war, and the cancer of corruption threatening the rule of law. The propriety of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky is a distraction.\n\nGiven our own problems, perhaps we should focus on other issues as well.\n\n\u2022 William J.
