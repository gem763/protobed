Police are hunting a hoodie-wearing assailant who fled on foot.\n\nWiersum was the lawyer for a state witness named Nabil B in a case against two Moroccan-born men dubbed the most wanted criminals in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the killing in broad daylight in the capital was \u201cincredibly disturbing\u201d and that police were \u201con top\u201d of the situation.\n\n\u201cThis is very alarming news. The police and the public prosecutor are investigating,\u201d Rutte told reporters.\n\nNetherlands becoming a narco-state, warn Dutch police Read more\n\nThe two suspects, Ridouan Taghi and Said Razzouki, are the subject of international arrest warrants for murder and drug trafficking.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s murder came a year after Nabil B\u2019s own brother was shot dead, raising questions about why Wiersum was not provided with better security.\n\nThe justice and security minister, Ferd Grapperhaus, said he has set up a team of police and prosecutors led by the country\u2019s counter-terrorism coordinator to intensify security around people working in the legal system.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack on our constitutional state,\u201d Grapperhaus told reporters in The Hague, adding: \u201cOrganised crime has crossed a line.\u201d\n\nOne of Wiersum\u2019s two children was at home at the time of the shooting, De Telegraaf newspaper said. Police covered his body with a white sheet while forensics teams investigated the site.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Peter de Vries, one of the Netherlands\u2019 best known crime reporters, told BNR news radio.\n\nAmsterdam has long been known for its tolerant attitude towards marijuana, but a report commissioned by the city council earlier this month said it now had a major problem with drugs.\n\nThe report, titled The Other Side of Amsterdam, said that \u201cdrug-related organised crime - the \u2019underworld\u2019 - exerts a significant influence on our city.\u201d\n\nOne of the main Dutch police unions said the shooting showed the situation in the Netherlands was getting out of control.\n\n\u201cThis is a confirmation that we live in a narco-state\u201d, said Jan Struijs of the NPB police union. \u201cIt is an attack on the rule of law.\u201d\n\nIn 2018 the union made a similar warning, saying that the government and politicians underestimated the scale of crime, corruption, threats and money-laundering in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, a man died of his wounds after gunmen on a scooter fired shots at his car on Wednesday evening. Police believe it was an unrelated incident.\n\nPolice said they were looking for two suspects wearing black and riding on a black three-wheeler scooter.", "description": "Derk Wiersum, 44, was gunned down in an Amsterdam street in broad daylight", "authors": ["Staff", "Agencies In Amsterdam"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92aacf5dd65fbb4aa693a873f8c08eb284b50a36/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2fb7188bdab44e40ad82f26cb4672680", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
