Brexit deal to \u2018final\u2019 vote", "language": "en", "text": "London (AFP) \u2013 Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces two crucial Brexit votes in parliament on Tuesday that will determine if he can fulfil his \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to take Britain out of the European Union next week.\n\nAs MPs threatened to derail the ratification of his Brexit deal, Johnson warned that defeat would see him abandon the legislation \u2014 and instead seek to call a snap election.\n\nBritain is entering a cliffhanger finale to a drama sparked by the 2016 referendum vote on whether to leave the EU, which has plunged the country into three years of political turmoil.\n\nJohnson was forced on Saturday to ask EU leaders to postpone the October 31 deadline for leaving \u2014 something he once said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than do.\n\nHe was required by law to send the letter after MPs refused to back the divorce deal he struck with Brussels last week, which paves the way for an orderly end to 46 years of integration.\n\nHowever, he still has a chance of avoiding a delay if he can get legislation implementing the treaty through parliament by October 31.\n\nThe House of Commons will hold its first vote on the bill at around 1800 GMT, followed by another vote on Johnson\u2019s timetable motion to rush it through parliament ahead of Brexit day.\n\nOpening the debate, Johnson urged MPs to support the legislation so \u201cwe can get Brexit done and move our country on\u201d.\n\nHe warned that if they failed, the \u201cbill will have to be pulled\u2026 and we will have to go forward to a general election,\u201d adding: \u201cI will argue at that election: let\u2019s get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nTwo previous attempts to call an election have failed, however.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth will the public think of us if this House again tonight votes not to get on with it, not to deliver Brexit on October 31 but to hand over control of what happens next to the EU?\u201d the Conservative leader said.\n\nJohnson warned defeat would kill any hope of leaving the EU with a deal on October 31, and risks a \u201cno deal\u201d exit if the EU declines to approve a third Brexit delay.\n\nHowever, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned the prime minister was trying to \u201cblindside\u201d parliament into supporting a substandard deal.\n\n\u201cA deal and a bill that fails to protect our rights and our natural world, fails to protect jobs and the economy, fails to protect every region and every nation in the UK,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 EU \u2018will be ready\u2019 \u2013\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the other 27 EU leaders were mulling Johnson\u2019s request to delay Brexit, but it would depend on how MPs vote.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the result of these consultations will very much depend on what the British parliament decides, or doesn\u2019t decide,\u201d he told the European Parliament.\n\n\u201cWe should be ready for every scenario.\u201d\n\nHe added on Twitter: \u201cI made clear to PM @BorisJohnson: a no-deal #Brexit will never be our decision.\u201d\n\nMPs voted to demand Johnson delay Brexit to try to avoid the damage of a \u201cno deal\u201d exit, where Britain severs ties with its closest trading partner with no new plans in place.\n\nThe prime minister on Tuesday said that if they backed his bill, \u201cwe can de-escalate those no-deal preparations immediately\u201d.\n\nThe deal is the second of its kind, after a Brexit text agreed by his predecessor Theresa May was rejected three times by MPs earlier this year.\n\nOutgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that the bloc had \u201cdone all in our power\u201d to assure an orderly divorce.\n\n\u2013 Years of trade talks \u2013\n\nEven if Johnson wins the two votes on Tuesday evening, MPs could still derail his bill.\n\nSome lawmakers want to secure much closer future trade relations with the EU after Brexit, seeking to amend the bill to demand Britain stay in the bloc\u2019s customs union.\n\nAfter tens of thousands of people demonstrated in London on Saturday in favour of a second referendum, some MPs will also seek to attach plans for a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d to the legislation.\n\nIf the Brexit withdrawal bill passes the Commons unscathed, it must still be approved by the unelected upper House of Lords \u2014 and then the European Parliament.\n\nThe withdrawal deal covers EU citizens\u2019 rights, Britain\u2019s financial settlements, a post-Brexit transition period until at least the end of 2020 and new trade arrangements for Northern Ireland.\n\nBut it only sets out the broad parameters for Britain\u2019s future ties with the EU, and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned this could be a much lengthier process.\n\n\u201cWe will have to renegotiate for one year, two years, three years, maybe more in some areas, to rebuild all that will have been pulled apart by the desire of those backing Brexit,\u201d Barnier said.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces two crucial Brexit votes in parliament on Tuesday that will
