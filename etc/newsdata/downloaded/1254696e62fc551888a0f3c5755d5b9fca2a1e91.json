This is an incredible show to be a part of. It\u2019s one of the biggest shows on TV, and hopefully the biggest after this.\u201d\n\nThe singing hopeful also shared his thoughts on not being on the Strictly line-up anymore.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nBrendan reflected: \"Being on Strictly is a great show. I\u2019m so honoured to have been a part of it for 15 years but I\u2019m no longer a part of it, that chapter is parked. This is a new chapter for me, and it\u2019s ridiculously exciting for all of us.\u201d\n\nHe also added that Strictly have some down sides as he shared: \"The time during Strictly you can\u2019t do anything else because it doesn\u2019t allow for it, it\u2019s five months of the year.\"\n\nBrendan will not be rocking the mic solo on the celebrity edition of X Factor as he is partnering up with his pal actor Jeremy Edwards.\n\n(Image: Dymond/Thames/Syco)\n\nThe former Holby City actor and dancer are looking to impress judges Simon Cowell , Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger and scoop a record deal.\n\nCole's move from the BBC to rival ITV may have riled his former bosses after they axed him from Strictly last year for clashing with the show's producers one too many times.\n\nA source close told The Sun : \"Initially it started out as a bit of a novelty idea but they're really enjoying it and have started to feel pretty optimistic about making a mark on the show.\"\n\n(Image: DAVID VENNI)\n\nIt's a bold move from Brendan who has never been one to shy away from controversy.\n\nThe source added: \"They've already filmed their first scenes, so there's no going back - but Strictly probably won't be too impressed when they find out he has jumped on board with their biggest rival after al those years.\"\n\n(Image: Evening Gazette)\n\nThey will competed with other bands including a Love Island supergroup and a team of singing rugby hunks.\n\nBrendan and Jeremy, 48, are both long-standing stars in their own field, with Cole having served on Strictly for 15 series making him one of the most popular professionals.\n\nEdwards starred in Hollyoaks for four years followed by another four at Holby City.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
