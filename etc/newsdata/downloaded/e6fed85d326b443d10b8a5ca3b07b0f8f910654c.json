I asked then if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: 'Of course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me'.\"\n\nMs Kelly said she asked the Queen if she would like to say: \"Good evening, James\", or \"Good evening, Mr Bond\", with the monarch choosing the latter.\n\nShe said: \"Within minutes, I was back in Edward's office delivering the good news to Danny - I think he almost feel off his chair when I said that the Queen's only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line: 'Good evening, Mr Bond'.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn the book, Ms Kelly also reveals she personally wears in the monarch's shoes before engagements to make sure they are comfortable.\n\nShe explains she shares the same shoe size as the Queen and given the monarch has little time to herself, she wears in the shoes for her.\n\nShe said: \"It makes the most sense this way.\"\n\n\"As has been reported a lot in the press, a flunky wears in Her Majesty's shoes to ensure that they are comfortable and that she is always good to go,\" she added.\n\n\"And yes, I am that flunky.\"\n\nIn the published extracts, Ms Kelly opens up about the meeting between Michelle Obama and the Queen which sparked controversy when the former first lady touched the Queen on the back.\n\n(Image: EPA)\n\nMs Kelly said it was \"natural instinct\" for the Queen to show affection and respect to \"another great woman\".\n\n\"The Queen has the ability to make everyone feel so relaxed that sometimes it feels instinctive to be tactile with her, just as Michelle Obama demonstrated during the State Visit with her husband, President Obama, in 2009,\" Ms Kelly says.\n\n\"Much has been made about the meeting between Michelle and Her Majesty when an instant and mutual warmth was shared between these two remarkable women, and protocol was abandoned as they stood closely with their arms around each other's backs.\"\n\nThe book also reveals how Yorkshire tea helped to recreate a replica of the royal christening gown which was first used for the christening of James, Viscount Severn, in 2008.\n\n\"To make sure it looked authentic we dyed it in Yorkshire tea (the strongest, as we all know),\" Ms Kelly said.\n\n\"We placed each piece of lace in a small bowl, from the Dressers' kitchen, filled with cool water and a tea bag and left it for about five minutes, checking regularly until the colour was perfect.\"\n\nRead the full article in Hello! magazine, out on Monday.", "description": "The Queen famously met 007 in a cameo performance for the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony", "authors": ["Dominica Sanda", "Joshua Taylor", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Epa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740127.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_London-2012-Olympics-Opening-Ceremony.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
