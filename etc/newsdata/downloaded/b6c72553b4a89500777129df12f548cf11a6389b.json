'But Trump has really laid out all of his cards. This is really not about my family. He has chosen my family to be the vehicle that he can [use to] influence the election.'\n\nValerie Biden Owens, Joe Biden's younger sister, said Trump 'has chosen my family to be the vehicle that he can influence the election'\n\nBiden Owens is helping run Biden's 2020 presidential campaign and in the past has managed his Senate and presidential runs. She also used her brother's rhetoric in calling the president 'unhinged'\n\nBiden Owens, 72, managed her brother's Senate campaigns and earlier presidential runs \u2013 but she doesn't hold the official title of campaign manager this time around.\n\n'So do you want to be in this scrum? No,' Biden's younger sister continued during a stop as part of a two-day campaign stint through South Carolina. 'But the part that is, not refreshing \u2014 hopeful to me, or makes me feel good, is that Trump thinks that we're the guy to beat. It's perverse, it's backwards. But he's coming after us. I don't want to protest too much, but the press has done their job on this. We haven't had to do it. There's nothing there. Now it's China. I mean, this guy's unhinged.'\n\nTrump has previously indicated he felt he would likely face Biden in the 2020 general elections, but recently changed his tune as the former vice president's poll numbers continue to slip.\n\n'I would LOVE running against 1% Joe Biden - I just don't think it's going to happen,' Trump tweeted October 6. 'Sleepy Joe won't get to the starting gate, & based on all of the money he & his family probably 'extorted,' Joe should hang it up. I wouldn't want him dealing with China & U!'\n\nThe president increased his attacks against his political rival in the past few weeks following revelations of the nature of his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnky.\n\nA transcript of the July 25 conversation revealed that Trump urged his Ukrainain counterpart to open an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe probe, in part, would have been centered around potential corruption involving Hunter taking a board position with a Ukrainian natural gas firm while his father was still serving as Barack Obama's vice president.\n\nTrump and his allies have also raised allegations that then-vice president Biden pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor because of an ongoing investigation into Hunter's business dealings in the country.\n\nThe president has upped his attacks on Biden \u2013 and gone after his family \u2013 after it was revealed he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate his political rival's business dealings in Ukraine\n\nLast week, Trump also publicly called on China to investigate the Bidens.\n\n'China should start an investigation into the Bidens,' Trump told reporters at the White House \u2013 something that Chinese officials rejected this week.\n\nThese attacks on Biden, 76, have thrust him, his family and his campaign into the spotlight at a time where he was already struggling to maintain his front-runner status in national and state polls.\n\nSeveral head-to-head matchups polls have shown Biden with a large lead against a hypothetical general election matchups with the incumbent president.\n\nBiden has invoked similar rhetoric as his sister when referring to the president.\n\nIn an ad campaign released last week, the Democratic candidate said Trump is 'fearful about his reelection' and is 'becoming more unhinged.'\n\n'Joe will take him down,' Biden Owens said to conclude, suggesting a campaign mantra.
