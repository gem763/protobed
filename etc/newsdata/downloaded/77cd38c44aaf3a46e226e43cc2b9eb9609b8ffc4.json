He also announced that his own educational initiative would introduce a blockchain curriculum.\n\nFrom Foxconn to politics\n\nGou, whose net worth is $6.7 billion according to Forbes, has gathered substantial economic and political clout since he founded Foxconn Technology Group in 1976.\n\nThe company, with a market capitalization of $33 billion, is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of consumer electronics, raking in $173 billion revenue last year. Foxconn makes smartphones, computers and electronic parts for a range of the world\u2019s IT giants including Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Lenovo.\n\nThe Taiwanese billionaire, also known as Gou Taiming, stepped down as Foxconn\u2019s chairman earlier this year to pursue the 2020 presidential bid, but dropped out of the race in September.\n\nGou has not returned to Foxconn since he announced that he would not to explore his bid, but his comments belied ambitions for a larger role in bolstering blockchain technology adoption and education.\n\nIn his speech, Gou said he would promote Libra in Taiwan by publishing a textbook about the currency for the Terry Gou Institute (TGI), which aims to cultivate the island\u2019s next generation of political and economic leaders.\n\n\u201cI have been in talks with many venture capital firms and they want to find better investments and create job opportunities for young people in Taiwan,\u201d Gou said.\n\nFoxconn and crypto\n\nThe manufacturing giant is active in the crypto space via several initiatives and client projects, including a lending platform for members of its supply chain.\n\nVia its subsidiary FnConn, in March 2017, Foxconn partnered with Dianrong, a well-known Chinese peer-to-peer lending platform. Its spinoff project Chained Finance helps non-bank lenders make direct loans in supply chains globally.\n\nThe initial demo run of its prototype yielded $6.5 million in loans being originated to members all along its large-scale supply chain.\n\nFoxconn\u2019s investment arm, HCM Capital, is one of the participating investors in the $250 million fundraising for crypto venture capital Galaxy Digital, founded by billionaire and former fund manager Mark Novogratz.\n\nHCM Capital led a $7 million Series A round in identity services startup Cambridge Blockchain in May 2018. PayPal announced to take a stake in the startup in April.\n\nFoxconn has also pushed blockchain projects for other companies, including blockchain mobile phone maker Sirin Lab, helping to develop Finney, one of the first blockchain mobile phones. The Finney cryptocurrency raised $227 million through token sale as of last December.\n\nFoxconn debuted its first investment in the bitcoin space in October 2017, leading a $16 million Series B funding round in the bitcoin remittance app Abra.\n\nTaiwan and crypto\n\nPerhaps reflecting Foxconn\u2019s influence in Taiwan, and Gou\u2019s pro-blockchain stance, the island of 23.8 million residents has implemented policies to develop the sector.\n\nTaiwanese financial watchdog the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) strengthened its regulations on crypto assets by further enforcing anti-money-laundering (AML) practices on bitcoin trading last year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Terry Gou, Taiwan's richest man and the founder of manufacturing giant Foxconn, wants the island to roll out the red carpet for Facebook's\u00a0Libra.", "authors": ["David Pan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GPBEIBd8UYDXU2I3q2bZyw--~B/aD03NDc7dz0xNDc5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/dfe5f54c954c7a16827e037408aeee2a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
