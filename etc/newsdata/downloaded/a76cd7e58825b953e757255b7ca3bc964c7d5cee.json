That was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\n\u2018For keen cyclists, that\u2019s a decent ride but for someone who\u2019s never ridden a bike with gears before, it was just horrendous.\u2019\n\nRoman admitted he was \u2018absolutely broken\u2019 after the 80-mile bike ride (Picture: Global)\n\nMeanwhile, Roman admitted he\u2019s had to take some pretty extreme measures to keep his mum from seeing what he\u2019s up to.\n\nChatting about getting a call from his parents, he said: \u2018It was really nice, to be honest everyone else was getting emotional!\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just nice to hear from them. It\u2019s my dad\u2019s birthday today so I wanted to call him but I couldn\u2019t. So it was nice to hear his voice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They just think I\u2019m an idiot to be honest. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d. If I had my phone, I\u2019d probably not be doing it because my mum would be going, \u201cStop, stop, stop\u201d.\n\nThe star added: \u2018I\u2019ve actually asked the Capital guys if they can block my mum from the account so they don\u2019t see what I\u2019m doing!\u2019\n\nBrutal.\n\nTo donate \u00a35 or \u00a310 to Global\u2019s Make Some Noise, text ROMAN5 or ROMAN10 to 70766 or donate at Capitalfm.com.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
