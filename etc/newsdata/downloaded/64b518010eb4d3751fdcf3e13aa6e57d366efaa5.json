The tracker monitors the statements of 222 large finance firms in the UK.\n\nThe job moves are far below earlier estimates made of the damage Brexit would do to the UK finance sector.\n\nIn 2016, consultancy Oliver Wyman estimated that around 3,500 jobs would be lost even if the UK retained close links to Europe and as many as 75,000 finance jobs could be lost in a hard Brexit. Former London Stock Exchange CEO Xavier Rolet said over 200,000 City of London jobs could go.\n\nOmar Ali, UK financial services leader at EY, said in a statement: \u201cGiven that many companies had pulled out all the stops to be ready ahead of the March deadline, much of the planning of temporary solutions for staff and operational moves has already been completed.\n\n\u201cFinancial Services firms have the building blocks in place, but have so far transferred fewer staff and assets to the continent than expected.\u201d\n\nWhile only 1,000 roles have been relocated, EY warns that this represents just 15% of the total number of jobs earmarked to be moved. About 7,000 staff are expected to ultimately relocate to Europe.\n\nDublin is the most popular relocation destination, followed by Luxembourg and Frankfurt.\n\nEY said as much as \u00a31 trillion in assets could be moved out of Britain ahead of Brexit.\n\n\u201cThere is still lots for the industry to contend with as we approach 31 October\u201d Ali said.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, an annual ranking of global financial centres produced by consultancy Z/Yen partners reaffirmed London\u2019s status as the second biggest global hub behind New York.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to be complacent,\u201d Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, said. \u201cDay by day, as uncertainty persists, so does the threat of more businesses moving jobs and operations away from the UK.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Next will slash prices and save \u00a325m under a no-deal Brexit", "description": "Banks have \"so far transferred fewer staff and assets to the continent than expected,\" EY's UK financial services head Omar Ali said.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9sWLAkIgwuX126DvtgxZ5g--~B/aD0zNDE1O3c9NTEyMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d5c3d710-dab8-11e9-b97d-1d988f48b0e3", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
