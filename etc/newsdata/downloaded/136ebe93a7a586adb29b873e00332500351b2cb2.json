We aim to make maximum progress in both areas.\n\n\u201cReducing our frequency from five to four flights a day is a good way of gaining more experience with Air&Rail services.\u201d\n\nThe move is partly in response to slot restrictions at Amsterdam airport (limiting the number of flights KLM can operate), and partly down to KLM\u2019s \u201cFly Responsibly\u201d commitment.\n\nThis initiative aims to create a sustainable future for air transport, and incorporates \u201call of KLM\u2019s current and future efforts to improve the sustainability of its activities\u201d. These include inviting consumers to offset the carbon emissions from their flights, and inviting companies to compensate for business travel by investing in the airline\u2019s Corporate BioFuel Programme.\n\nSurprisingly for an airline, KLM announced this summer that it wanted to encourage passengers to \u201cmake responsible decisions about flying\u201d.\n\n\u201cFlying \u2013 after all these years the feeling is still magical. For many of us it changed our world forever,\u201d Elbers wrote in an open letter.\n\n\u201cWhen we started 100 years ago, our major concern was your safety. Little did we know about the impact we would have on the environment. Today we know aviation comes with another big responsibility \u2013 to make sure our children have a planet to explore, as well.\u201d\n\nElbers said KLM would share its \u201cbest practices and tools\u201d around sustainability with its competitors, and is asking the aviation industry to share their knowledge in turn.\n\nThe campaign was supported by a video, which asked air travellers: \u201cDo you always have to meet face to face?\u201d, \u201dcould you take the train instead?\u201d and \u201ccould you contribute by compensating your CO2 emissions or packing light?\u201d", "description": "Dutch airline KLM is replacing one of its daily flights between Amsterdam Schiphol\u00a0airport and Brussels with a high-speed train service.
