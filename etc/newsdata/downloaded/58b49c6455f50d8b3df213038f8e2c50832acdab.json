His journey helps unravel a mystery that threatens the survival of our planet.\n\nDirected by James Gray (Lost City of Z), Ad Astra also stars Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones (Jason Bourne), Ruth Negga (Loving), Liv Tyler (The Lord of the Rings), and Donald Sutherland (The Hunger Games).\n\nWhile most space movies pit humans and aliens against each other, director Gray hopes this film will offer a different perspective.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many great films made in the science fiction genre, but how many are there that move you? I wanted to do something that was the opposite of most space travel movies, to offer a somewhat positive view which results in meeting aliens, or intelligent life, that are benevolent \u2013 or at least interesting enough to involve us,\u201d he says.\n\nThe best sci-fi movies to rewatch for the 50th anniversary of the Moon Landing\n\nWriter Ethan Gross says the film doesn\u2019t attempt to predict the future, but rather offers one version of it.\n\n\u201cThis story is not necessarily the future we think is going to happen ... It\u2019s just a film about what could happen if space exploration continued and we populated the moon and Mars and beyond,\u201d he says.\n\nSurprisingly, for a film that mostly takes place in outer space, Ad Astra involved very little green screen or CGI work.\n\nVideo of Ad Astra Official Trailer [HD] 20th Century FOX\n\nFor most of the sets depicting the Earth, the moon, Mars and Neptune, the filmmakers chose to shoot in real locations rather than on stages.\n\nFor production designer Kevin Thompson and the rest of the location team, this meant driving all over Los Angeles County in search of environments that would match Gray\u2019s vision.\n\nLocation manager Chris Kusiak admits that finding locations was a real challenge. He scouted places that he had never been to before, including an abandoned department store in downtown Los Angeles. Underneath the building was an old subway station where trains used to terminate.\n\nSpace-related fiction books you need to read\n\n\u201cWe needed a lot of underground sites, and Los Angeles is not a city for that \u2013 that\u2019s more New York or Pennsylvania,\u201d says Kusiak.\n\n\u201c[Thompson] did a brilliant job, but we shot in such cramped quarters, which was the goal because that\u2019s what it is really like on a spacecraft,\u201d Gray adds. \u201cAnd we had to build the sets twice, because we had to have both horizontal and vertical versions.\n\n\u201cThere were times when Brad would be in a harness hanging 30 feet up and the camera would be looking up at him as he was hanging. It looked like zero gravity, but it was very arduous.\u201d\n\nScience fiction writer Emma Newman, of the 'Planetfall' series, on how the genre allows readers to explore humanity\n\nTo give the film a timeless look, Thompson decided to eschew any futuristic-looking gadgets and weapons, and calls the props used an \u201cextension of the 60s and 70s space technology\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a little step backwards,\u201d says Thompson, \u201cwith people still using paper, still using old systems of communication.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to distract with futuristic technology. The most futuristic item we have is a little, clear scanner because the screens will be transparent and project information on them. We use those, but we also used tablets and flat screens for video imagery. It feels minimal enough that it won\u2019t appear too dated,\u201d he explains.", "description": "A sci-fi thriller set in the future, Ad Astra stars Brad Pitt as an elite astronaut who travels to the outer edges of the solar system to find his missing father.
