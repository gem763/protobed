Some will tell you it\u2019s approaching a certainty. Think of it this way: President DONALD TRUMP has just admitted that he -- the president of the United States -- discussed getting dirt on JOE BIDEN, a domestic political adversary, with a foreign leader. And now the president is withholding the whistleblower complaint from Congress.\n\nHERE IS WHAT TO WATCH FOR this week: Will more and more fence-sitting Democrats explicitly call for an impeachment inquiry? House Intelligence Chairman ADAM SCHIFF (D-Calif.), a top ally of House leadership, laid down an important marker Sunday: The courts are too slow and cumbersome for Democrats, and they need another remedy, and that remedy might be impeachment.\n\nUNLIKE THE BYZANTINE RUSSIAGATE ALLEGATIONS, the latest charge -- that the president repeatedly tried to get a foreign leader seeking military aid to investigate a political opponent -- is not hard to understand. It\u2019s about the actions of Trump himself, not his aides or former campaign nobodies. At this point, the facts are pretty much in the open and agreed to: The president has practically admitted he discussed Biden with Ukraine\u2019s president, and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani has been open about pressing the Ukrainians to investigate Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Now it\u2019s up to Congress to figure out how to proceed.\n\nSPEAKER NANCY PELOSI understands the caucus\u2019 moods better than anyone, and her letter Sunday -- which said the president needs to hand over the whistleblower report now, or else -- was a rifle shot that should not be underestimated.\n\nTIME IS OF THE ESSENCE for the Trump White House. If they don\u2019t produce the whistleblower report within days -- maybe a week -- Democrats are going to be under extreme pressure to move toward impeachment. Thursday will be an important day to watch: That\u2019s when Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, is testifying in an open hearing.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT SAID HE\u2019S CONSIDERING releasing a transcript of the phone call in question. From what we heard in the last few days, that\u2019s not going to be enough for Democrats. They want the whistleblower report, and if they don\u2019t get it, that\u2019s going to be problematic.\n\nTHE DETAILS \u2026\n\n-- PELOSI\u2019S WARNING \u2026 \u201cPelosi warns White House over whistleblower complaint,\u201d by Sarah Ferris and Eleanor Mueller: \u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday delivered a blunt warning to the Trump administration over its refusal so far to share details of an explosive whistleblower complaint, amid intensifying pressure from the vocal pro-impeachment wing of the Democratic Caucus.\n\n\u201cPelosi wrote in a rare weekend letter to lawmakers that President Donald Trump would enter \u2018a grave new chapter of lawlessness\u2019 if he succeeded in blocking Congress from learning about his reported conversations pressing Ukranian officials to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner in the 2020 presidential contest.\n\n\u201cThat kind of stonewalling, she said, would lead Democrats \u2018into a whole new stage of investigation\u2019 \u2014 marking her most forceful response yet to reports that Trump sought help from a foreign government to find dirt on a political rival. Still, Pelosi did not address the single biggest question on the mind of her caucus: impeachment.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT: \u201cAs Trump Confirms He Discussed Biden With Ukraine, Pressure to Impeach Builds,\u201d by Nick Fandos, Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman: \u201cPresident Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival.\n\n\u201cIn public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration\u2019s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment.\u201d NYT\n\n-- DARREN SAMUELSOHN: \u201cInside the Trump legal team trying to stop impeachment before it starts\u201d\n\nGood Monday morning. THE WASHINGTON NATIONALS lost Sunday to the cellar-dwelling Miami Marlins. They landed at Dulles on Sunday night at 8:40 p.m., and play the Philadelphia Phillies tonight. They have five games against the Phillies this week -- a doubleheader Tuesday night -- and then three against the Cleveland Indians. The Nats are tied with the Milwaukee Brewers for a wild-card berth.\n\nA message from Blue Cross Blue Shield Association: No one should have to worry about surprise bills or costly negotiations to settle them.

From CEO to commander in chief. From boardrooms to the Oval Office. From studios to global stage.\u2019\u201d WaPo\n\n-- ANITA KUMAR: \u201cAt a rally like no other, Trump woos Indian American voters ahead of 2020\u201d\n\nUP NEXT: TURTLE BAY \u2026 \u201cAt U.N., Trump to face questions about Iran, Ukraine, allies,\u201d by AP\u2019s Jonathan Lemire: \u201cFaced with growing tumult at home and abroad, President Donald Trump heads into his three-day visit to the United Nations this week hoping to lean on strained alliances while fending off questions about whether he sought foreign help to damage a political rival. Trump\u2019s latest U.N. trip comes after nearly three years of an \u2018America First\u2019 foreign policy that has unsettled allies and shredded multinational pacts.\n\n\u201cA centerpiece of this year\u2019s U.N. schedule will be a Monday session on climate change that Trump plans to skip. Instead, he will address a meeting about the persecution of religious minorities, particularly Christians, an issue that resonates with Trump\u2019s evangelical supporters.\u201d AP\n\n-- POLITICO\u2019s Ryan Heath is writing a special pop-up UNGA newsletter all week.

But the president's campaign team is increasingly grim about a repeat performance in the traditionally blue Rust Belt state. After a midterm election that decimated the ranks of Michigan Republicans, Trump's campaign is looking to other battlegrounds he lost last time \u2014 such as Minnesota and New Hampshire \u2014 that they see as more promising.\n\n\u201cThe assessment illustrates how Trump\u2019s support in the Rust Belt states that propelled him to the presidency has softened, jeopardizing his prospects for a second term. While they say it\u2019s too early to write off Michigan \u2014 Trump aides say the campaign still intends to pump resources into the state \u2014 a range of public polling has shown Trump in poor shape here.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT\u2019S REID EPSTEIN in Webster City, Iowa: \u201c2020 Democrats Go All In on Iowa\u201d: \u201cIowa\u2019s presidential caucuses disenfranchise huge blocs of voters. The state is 91 percent white. It is not easy to get to, or get around in. But to a greater degree than in recent campaigns, this unrepresentative and idiosyncratic state is proving that it is the only electoral battleground that matters for Democrats from now until caucus night on Feb. 3.\n\n\u201cFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s campaign said it would have 110 staff members in the state by the end of this month. Senator Kamala Harris has promised to visit every week in October. Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Sunday kicked off a John McCain-like, everything-on-the-record bus tour and is advertising on local television and radio. Senator Amy Klobuchar is 49 counties into her tour of all 99 in the state. And on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders will begin a \u2018Bernie Beats Trump\u2019 tour of eastern Iowa to highlight what he says is his strength as a general election candidate.\u201d NYT\n\n-- WSJ: \u201cIn Atlanta Suburb, Republicans See an Uphill Battle,\u201d by Cameron McWhirter in Duluth, Ga.: \u201cGwinnett County in Atlanta\u2019s suburbs has been a Republican stronghold since Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, but an influx of minorities has transformed it, creating a possible Democratic juggernaut for 2020.\n\n\u201c\u2018If the Republicans don\u2019t broaden their base, they are in serious trouble,\u2019 said Fran Millar, a former Republican state senator who lost his re-election bid last year. No matter how much he campaigned, \u2018It didn\u2019t matter. I had the \u201cR\u201d next to my name,\u2019 said Mr. Millar, whose district was partly in Gwinnett.\n\n\u201cHot-button issues, including President Trump\u2019s calls to limit immigration and a GOP-backed state abortion law, are driving people of color and women in suburban Atlanta to the Democrats, Mr. Millar said.\u201d WSJ\n\nTRUMP\u2019S MONDAY -- The president will leave Trump Tower at 11:20 a.m. en route to the United Nations headquarters. He will lead an event on religious freedom at 11:30 a.m. Afterward, Trump will travel to the InterContinental New York Barclay, where he will hold a bilateral meeting with Pakistani President Arif Alvi. Then, he will hold a bilateral meeting at 2:25 p.m. with Polish President Andrzej Duda, followed by a pull-aside meeting with New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern at 3 p.m.\n\nTrump will also hold bilateral meetings with Singaporean President Halimah Yacob, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. He will depart the InterContinental at 6:05 p.m. and return to Trump Tower.\n\nPLAYBOOK READS\n\nPHOTO DU JOUR: House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) pauses at the casket of his wife, Emily, on Sunday, Sept. 22, in West Columbia, S.C. | Meg Kinnard/AP Photo\n\nUNGA LATEST -- \u201cMacron cautious on Trump-Rouhani meeting at U.N. summit,\u201d by POLITICO Europe\u2019s Rym Momtaz with the French president en route to New York: \u201cFrench President Emmanuel Macron said recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities have complicated his efforts to broker a U.S.-Iran meeting at the U.N. this week but he made clear he will press on with his initiative to bring the two sides together. ...\n\n\u201cMacron is expected to hold separate meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York.

Of those appeals, over 10,000 have come from just one company: Arrowhead Engineered Products Inc. of Blaine, Minn.\n\n\u201cArrowhead imports thousands of aftermarket repair parts for cars, lawn mowers, all-terrain vehicles and other items from China, which are now all being taxed with a 25% tariff that is set to jump to 30% on Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cThe duties have undermined Arrowhead\u2019s business model of selling cheaper alternatives to manufacturers\u2019 parts, company officials said. Appealing the levies has proved a challenge in itself, illustrating the trade war\u2019s sometimes hidden toll on U.S. companies. \u201cWe basically put everything else on the back burner\u201d to appeal the tariffs, said John Mosunic, Arrowhead\u2019s chief operating officer.\u201d WSJ\n\nPLAYBOOK CRIME SECTION -- \u201cTrump Tower Theft: $353,000 in Jewelry Reported Stolen,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Ashley Southall\n\nMEDIAWATCH \u2026 COREY LEWANDOWSKI sort of apologized for saying he had no obligation to be truthful with the media, in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Howard Kurtz: \u201cI regret the fact that I should have explained it better and specifically as it related to my tenure in front of the special counsel \u2026 but I did that out of respect for the special counsel and the investigative process and at the advice of counsel, so we didn\u2019t spend countless hours answering these questions in the public while the investigation continued.\u201d Mediaite\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S MARGARET SULLIVAN: \u201cWyoming is ground zero for media mistrust.
