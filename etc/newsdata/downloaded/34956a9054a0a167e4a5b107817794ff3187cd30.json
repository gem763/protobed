It's very difficult for me to say this about my sister - but I have worked with people with Down's syndrome and they are more intelligent than she is.\n\n\"She was never diagnosed, because years ago they didn't like to label a child as disabled, but you don't need to be a doctor to know that she has problems.\"\n\nJane has lived independently in Torquay since both her parents died. She also has chronic health problems and is currently being treated for necrotic toe as a result of progressive diabetes.\n\n(Image: Jeff J Mitchell)\n\nHer neighbours keep an eye on her and her sister acts as her main carer, although she is not paid.\n\nShe was on Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA) for 40 years but two years ago - after three spells in hospital - she was switched to ESA which is for people who have a disability or health condition that affects how much they can work.\n\nThe family unsuccessfully appealed the decision to cut her benefits and have just been told that the mandatory reconsideration has been turned down by the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nNow after being turned down for ESA, Jane was told that also means her housing benefit will stop. Susan said: \"She will literally lose her home. She is very happy there because everybody looks out for her and they ring me if she needs help.\n\n(Image: UPPA/Photoshot)\n\n\"She is feeling very tearful and bamboozled at the moment. I have tried to explain it to her but she gets upset when I talk about it because she doesn't understand.\n\n\"I was recently made redundant and have used all my savings to look after her.\n\n\"Also I have been taking her to all her appointments and can't get another job because I've been spending all my time trying to sort this out.\"\n\nThe family has written to Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for health and social care, and to Torbay MP Kevin Foster.\n\nNow they are taking the case to an independent tribunal at Newton Abbot magistrates court before Her Majesty\u2019s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS).\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said it is looking into the case.", "description": "Jane Cooper, from\u00a0 Torquay, Devon, who is just 4ft 4in tall, has never been able to have a proper job", "authors": ["Colleen Smith", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Devon Live", "Jeff J Mitchell", "Uppa Photoshot"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20590298.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Childlike-Jane-55-is-about-to-lose-her-home-after-being-refused-benefitsJane-Cooper-has-learnin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
