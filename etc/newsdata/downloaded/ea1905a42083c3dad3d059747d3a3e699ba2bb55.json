Starring: No\u00e9mie Merlant, Ad\u00e8le Haenel, Lu\u00e0na Bajrami, and Valeria Golino. 119 mins\n\nIn Portrait of a Lady on Fire, director C\u00e9line Sciamma resists showing us the face of H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) for as long as possible. She\u2019s the daughter of a Countess (Valeria Golina) in 18th-century Brittany, sent home from the convent with an eye to securing a prosperous match. She will sit for a portrait, which will then be shipped off to her suitor in Milan as proof of her beauty. We first meet H\u00e9lo\u00efse through the eyes of Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant), the second artist invited to capture her likeness, after she refused to sit for the first. The request, then, is that Marianne poses as a walking companion, studying H\u00e9lo\u00efse in secret.\n\nAs they set off on their first promenade, Marianne is greeted only by the back of her subject\u2019s head. H\u00e9lo\u00efse, the hood of her cloak up, storms onwards. The camera follows with interest, matching Marianne\u2019s view (or lack of view). As H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s pace quickens, the hood flies back to reveal blond curls \u2013 she\u2019s running now, right towards the cliffs that line the property\u2019s edge. And then, she stops and turns around. We finally see her, exposed and vulnerable. The two of them are perfect opposites: H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s gaze is piercing, the corners of her mouth turned down in a permanent scowl; Marianne\u2019s eyes, meanwhile, are dark, wide, hungry.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWith one look, we can already tell these women will fall for each other \u2013 even if they don\u2019t know it themselves. There\u2019s minimal dialogue, which is bold considering the cast consists only of a handful of players. But Haenel and Merlant carry the film with ease and elan, projecting pages of unwritten script in the pauses between words.\n\nSciamma\u2019s gorgeous romantic film concerns itself almost entirely with the unseen powers of the gaze. Through quiet, contemplative scenes \u2013 with the camera often left to rest on a close-up \u2013 we\u2019re invited to study these women, just as they\u2019re studying each other. Their desire is read through the subtlest of hints: the way hands might briefly brush up against each other or a faint smile will crack across H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s stony face. Sciamma\u2019s work so far has always been notable for its striking sense of modernity (2014\u2019s Girlhood featured an unforgettable sequence of its main character dancing to Rihanna\u2019s \u201cDiamonds\u201d), but here she proves she can draw equally from the world of classical romanticism, with all its tragic longing and suppressed passions.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 10 Best European films 1/10 People on Sunday (1930) Dir: Robert Siodmak, Edgar G. Ulmer What did young German people get up to at the weekend in Weimar Berlin? If this silent film is the measure, they ate, drank, went to the park, mucked around and had sex in the woods. People on Sunday is as fresh today as when it was first shown. It was made by some of the most talented figures in German cinema history, all at the very start of their careers and all about to be forced abroad by Hitler. Billy Wilder was the screenwriter, while Fred Zinnemann was the cinematographer. Called a \u201cfilm without actors\u201d, it is utterly fascinating as a slice of social history but also has a wild mischief and youthful energy. BFI 2/10 L\u2019Atalante (1934) Dir: Jean Vigo \u201cVigo is cinema incarnate in one man,\u201d the legendary French film curator Henri Langlois rhapsodised about director Jean Vigo, who died of TB aged only 29 in 1934. That was the year Vigo completed his masterpiece, L\u2019Atalante (1934), a film not only revered by generations of critics but still considered a viable dating movie today. It tells the story of a barge journey across France. Two newly weds, Captain Jean (Jean Dast\u00e9) and his sweetheart Juliette (Dita Parlo), set off together, madly in love, accompanied on their voyage by the ship\u2019s barnacled mate P\u00e8re Jules (played by the great French character actor, Michel Simon) Jealousy, discomfort and homesickness threaten to fray the relationship. The film is both a paean to rural France and an astonishingly delicate and lyrical love story. Gaumont Film Company 3/10 La R\u00e8gle du Jeu/The Rules of the Game (1939) Dir: Jean Renoir We probably wouldn\u2019t have had Downton Abbey without it. Jean Renoir\u2019s film was a direct influence on Robert Altman\u2019s Gosford Park, scripted by Julian Fellowes, who would later create Downton. The British may like to think that they originated the country house drama but Renoir does a superb job here, both upstairs and downstairs. This is a comedy of manners but one featuring conspiracy, betrayal and murder. On the evidence here, the French upper classes were just as corrupt and hypocritical as their British equivalents. \"I wanted to depict a society dancing on a volcano,\" the director later observed of the film, made just before the start of the Second World War. Nouvelle \u00c9dition Fran\u00e7aise 4/10 Viaggio in Italia/Voyage to Italy (1954) Dir: Roberto Rossellini The wonderfully supercilious George Sanders shows his familiar mellowness of sneer as the husband being very beastly to his wife (Ingrid Bergman) in Rossellini\u2019s dark romantic drama. The director was one of the pioneers of Neorealist cinema but this was a film in a very different register to his earlier epics Rome, Open City and Paisa. It\u2019s a caustic, uncomfortably intimate psychodrama about a couple on holiday in Naples whose marriage is falling apart. They can hardly bear to look at each other. Rossellini throws in references to antiquity \u2013 and in particular to the disaster at Pompeii \u2013 to show the couple\u2019s relationship in a very different light. The film has one of the strangest, most surprising and moving endings in all of cinema. Titanus Distribuzione 5/10 Wild Strawberries (1957) Dir: Ingmar Bergman British (and international) perspectives on Sweden are very strongly influenced by the films of Ingmar Bergman. Summer with Monika (1953), with Harriet Andersson as \u201cmucky Monika\u201d, dealt with sexuality in a far freer way than any British films from the period. The Seventh Seal (1957) fixed the image of the gloomy, introspective Scandinavian playing chess with Death on the beach. Bergman\u2019s Wild Strawberries, about a vain old professor (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m), about to receive a great honour, looking back on his life, is an achingly beautiful film. It opens with one of cinema\u2019s great dream sequences. In the course of the movie, the Scrooge-like professor revisits his past, comes to terms with his old demons and very movingly begins to mellow. AB Svensk Filmindustri 6/10 A Bout de Souffle/Breathless (1960) Dir: Jean-Luc Godard Godard\u2019s famous formulation that all you need to make a movie is \u201ca girl and a gun\u201d has a whiff of sexism about it. Breathless, though, is an example of a European New Wave film that blew everybody away. You could ignore the gossamer-thin crime thriller plot altogether and just concentrate on the formal boldness (all those jump cuts) and the interplay between the two stars. Movie couples didn\u2019t come any more charismatic than the close-cropped Jean Seberg in her New York Herald Tribune T-shirt and Jean-Paul Belmondo as the petty gangster, coming on like a Gallic Humphrey Bogart \u2013 but a craggier, better looking one who managed to make the simple act of smoking a cigarette into a supreme poetic endeavour. Films Around The World 7/10 The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) Dir: Luis Bu\u00f1uel Spanish director Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s Oscar winner about a group of well-heeled characters trying, and failing, to have dinner offered everything bourgeois British audiences wanted in a European arthouse movie. It was risque (the dinner hosts upstairs attempting to have sex while their dinner guests wait below), funny, morbid and very surprising. Imagine an X-rated version of The Good Life or Abigail\u2019s Party and you\u2019ll come close to its essence. In its own more restrained way, the film was also as subversive as Un Chien Andalou, Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s earlier surrealist masterpiece (co-directed with Salvador Dali). As American director Alan Rudolph noted approvingly, \u201cwatching this for the first time took every muscle in my appreciation mechanism. The satire is sharp, the tone startling, the humour cathartic.\u201d 20th Century Fox 8/10 Veronika Voss (1982) Dir: Rainer Werner Fassbinder Rainer Werner Fassbinder was the arch provocateur of European art house cinema in an era of huge generational friction in German society. He died young, aged 37 in 1982, but racked up an astonishing number of films. This was his penultimate feature, an elegiac and twisted Sunset Boulevard-like love story about the romance between a hardbitten sports reporter and an ageing, drug-addled movie star, disgraced because of her links to the Nazi regime. The film has grim moments involving drug addiction and the Holocaust. It is also gorgeously shot in black and white, boasts a beguiling score by Peer Raben, and is full of unexpected moments of lyricism and tenderness. As director Mark Cousins put it,\u201cRainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s women are versions of himself, his languor and despair. Wow.\u201d The Criterion Collection 9/10 The Three Colours Trilogy (1993-1994) Dir: Krzysztof Kieslowski When the Iron Curtain came down, many eastern European filmmakers were left at a total loss. They had spent their careers making veiled critiques of the Soviet Union and didn\u2019t know what stories to tell next. Krzysztof Kieslowski was one Polish director who adjusted comfortably to changing times. His Three Colours trilogy, a series of features made in quick succession, looked at liberty, equality and fraternity in strictly personal and metaphysical terms. The three features were closely focused character studies. Some critics sneered that the trilogy, with its beautiful protagonists (Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy, Irene Jacob), looked like shampoo commercials. The glossy production values notwithstanding, these commercially successful European arthouse films ventured into spiritual, philosophical realms that few British films would go near. MK2 Distribution 10/10 The Lives of Others (2006) Dir: Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck Nobody thought much of The Lives of Others at first. The Cannes Festival turned it down for competition. So did Berlin. Nonetheless, when it finally reached British cinemas in 2007, audiences were fascinated by debut director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck\u2019s depiction of an East German society in which everybody snooped on everybody else. Donnersmarck somehow gave a story about the Stasi spying on a playwright with suspect views a huge emotional kick. Anyone expecting a John Le Carr\u00e9-style Cold War drama was wrong-footed by a film in which even the clammy, voyeuristic State spy (Ulrich M\u00fche) ends up behaving with an unexpected nobility and selflessness.

Wiedemann & Berg\n\nBut Portrait of a Lady on Fire isn\u2019t only about the look between two women as lovers, but between two women in the position of artist and subject. As H\u00e9lo\u00efse points out, when Marianne is painting her, where else is she meant to look but back at her? It\u2019s a concept conveniently missing from heterosexual representations of artist and muse, which are largely marked by an imbalance of power. \u201cEquality is a pleasant feeling,\u201d Marianne notes. Marianne gets her period and the household\u2019s servant Sophie (Lu\u00e0na Bajrami) goes through an abortion, both dealt with in the unfussed manner of women free to live unbothered by the outside interests and restrictions of men. In fact, men are only fleetingly glimpsed, there as a reminder that this must all soon end for H\u00e9lo\u00efse, destined is she for marital imprisonment.\n\nBut they gaze at each other still, taking in every inch of skin and every gesture. Real love may be fleeting, but as Portrait of a Lady on Fire explains, art and memory are immortal.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire is being screened as part of the London Film Festival.
