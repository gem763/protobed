She worked in a cafe, then became a carer - gaining a social care qualification - but had to leave her job because of mental health problems.\n\nShe said she turned to sex work because her universal credit payments were not enough to cover her basic living costs.\n\n\"It is horrible to say, but it is the easiest thing to keep us girls alive,\" she said.\n\nAdvances are available while people wait for their first payment, however this must then be paid back from subsequent payments so T said she continued to struggle to make ends meet.\n\n\"I only spend \u00a320 on gas and electric a fortnight... I am trying my best, \u00a330 on shopping, not a penny over, because if I go a penny over I can't get other stuff that I need, tampons and things.\n\n\"By the time I got [the advance payment] I had spent it and then I was waiting another three to four weeks for my benefit.\n\n\"Even then when I got my benefit, they were taking \u00a3150 off my benefit and I was left with \u00a350.\"\n\nShe said she is now \"sofa-surfing\", having been evicted from her house because she fell behind on rent payments.\n\n'I left the baby next door'\n\nAn adviser for a London-based housing association shared the experience of one mother - referred to as Ms J - who had resorted to survival sex after being caught shoplifting because she could not afford to buy food.\n\n\"The manager said if I gave him [oral sex] he'd let me off. What could I do? It was that or have the police called,\" she said.\n\n\"He said afterwards that if I did the same next week he'd let me have forty quid's worth of stock. It seemed like a fortune.\"\n\nThe woman had faced long waits for her universal credit payments, which she said did not cover her basic costs.\n\n\"In the end, I held out for two weeks. I got my [universal credit] money, and again it was short, and again it was gone on bills before I'd even thought of food.\n\n\"So, I left the baby with next door and went down to the shop... It's been like that for months now.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Independent MP Frank Field says women in his Birkenhead constituency are being forced into survival sex\n\nThe committee said the government's initial response to the issue was \"defensive, dismissive and trite\".\n\nIn a written submission to the committee's inquiry, the DWP described reports linking universal credit and survival sex as \"anecdote\" and said the benefits system could not be \"robustly attributed as a sole cause\" of the issue.\n\nHowever, after listening to the testimony of women, work and pensions minister Will Quince apologised for the department's previous submission and said there was a need for better understanding of the issue.\n\nThe committee's chair, independent MP Frank Field, said he welcomed the minister's comments but said they must be accompanied by action.\n\n\"The department, having belatedly acknowledged that there is a problem, must take the steps to resolve it,\" he said.\n\nThe committee's report made a number of recommendations, including scrapping the five-week wait for the first payment and, in the meantime, offering non-repayable advances to vulnerable claimants who would otherwise suffer hardship.\n\nIt also called on the department to take account of people's \"lived experience\" of universal credit and publish a review on improving services and support for those engaged in survival sex.\n\nLaura Watson from the English Collective of Prostitutes, which gave evidence to the committee, said single mothers have been \"hit particularly hard\" by universal credit.\n\nShe added that payment delays have led to \"increased destitution and homelessness\" as well as pushing more women into \"survival sex\".\n\n\"The report strengthens demands for universal credit to be scrapped,\" she said.\n\nA DWP spokesperson said it was \"committed to providing a safety net for the most vulnerable in society\" and had made improvements to universal credit, including extending advance payments, removing waiting days and allowing claimants to continue to be paid housing benefit for two weeks after moving on to universal credit.", "description": "Some women are being driven to sex work because of problems with universal credit, MPs say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2B2E/production/_107945011_14e941b6-3589-4389-b575-3dcd8df70af7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
