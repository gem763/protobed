The latest turn comes from Ed Werder of ESPN, who reported that the Raiders fined Brown for the argument he had with general manager Mike Mayock during Wednesday\u2019s practice. The Raiders leaked they were considering suspending Brown over the incident, but never followed through with that after he apologized.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nBrown isn\u2019t happy with the latest fine according to a source, Werder said. That should sound familiar. And then came a new YouTube video from Brown.\n\nAntonio Brown\u2019s new YouTube video\n\nBrown posting a YouTube video of an apparent phone conversation with Jon Gruden is curiously timed, to say the least. It came not too long after the Raiders announced he\u2019d play on Monday night against the Broncos.\n\nIn the video posted Friday night, Brown is apparently having a phone conversation with Gruden which was taped (California law requires both parties\u2019 consent to record phone calls). There\u2019s no way of knowing if it\u2019s Gruden or where and when the conversation took place, but in the video the person who sounds exactly like Gruden asks Brown if he wants to be a Raider, and Brown replies he has been trying to be a Raider since \u201cday one. Brown then asks Gruden if the Raiders want him.\n\n\u201cPlease stop this s\u2014- and just play football. How hard is that?\u201d Gruden said on the video. \u201cYou\u2019re a great football player. Just play football.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the video, posted to Antonio Brown\u2019s verified YouTube page (be warned, it has explicit language):\n\nStory continues\n\nRemember the controversy that came from Brown broadcasting on Facebook Live from the Steelers locker room? Most NFL teams don\u2019t like private conversations publicized. But Gruden reportedly is fine with it.\n\nMore on @AB84 You Tube video: Raiders source says Gruden was truly amused by it and even thought it was \"awesome.\"\n\nThat's all. Next. \u2014 Chris Mortensen (@mortreport) September 7, 2019\n\nOf course.\n\nBrown: \u201cFree me!\u201d\n\nHere was the caption to the video on YouTube:\n\n\u201cWith all these false narratives antagonizing me, it\u2019s time for me to control my own narrative. Show the world I\u2019m not the bad guy. Show the world you can free yourself from the lies and become your own person. I am not just AB the football player, I am Antonio Brown, the person, who paved a way for himself to be in charge of his own life. Free me!\u201d\n\nThe Raiders have already let Brown slide with everything else, so why not post a video of an apparent phone conversation with the coach? The Steelers made mistakes enabling Brown, and the Raiders are voluntarily headed down the same path.\n\nIn a little more than a month Brown has created more drama than most NFL players do in a lifetime. It\u2019s probably best to assume there\u2019s more to come.\n\nGLENDALE, AZ - AUGUST 15: Oakland Raiders wide receiver Antonio Brown (84) smiles before the NFL preseason football game between the Oakland Raiders and the Arizona Cardinals on August 15, 2019 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
