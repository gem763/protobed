Hydro Tasmania said at the time that the bidding instructions will reduce the risk of the Basslink cable operating above its design limits.\n\nUnder Hydro Tasmania's instructions, from Nov 1 to May 31, the last 33 megawatts of Basslink's 478 MW capacity can only be used when the wholesale electricity price reaches the market price cap.\n\nBasslink chief executive Malcolm Eccles said on Monday: \"The pricing instruction given by Hydro Tasmania is unnecessary as it is based on multiple assumptions, hypotheticals and disputed information. In Basslink's opinion, the pricing instruction may result in a series of deviations to various compliance responsibilities and legal requirements of Hydro Tasmania.\"\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nNevertheless, Basslink has \"no choice but to comply\" with Hydro Tasmania's pricing instruction under the Basslink Services Agreement, it said.\n\nStay updated with\n\nBT newsletters Terms & conditions Sign up\n\nBasslink noted that Hydro Tasmania received a preliminary recommendation on July 24 from DNV GL to limit the interconnector's capacity as part of an initial evaluation that has not been validated, is based on assumptions, and is subject to ongoing analysis by DNV GL.\n\nIn response, Basslink provided Hydro Tasmania an independent response from its experts, Cable Consulting International, which expressed concerns about the reliability of the information used by DNV GL to come up with its recommendation.\n\nDespite these concerns, Hydro Tasmania has not provided Basslink with any further work or investigation conducted by DNV GL beyond the preliminary evaluation three months ago, Basslink said.\n\nBasslink also said the pricing instruction will further restrict its import and export limits and impact Tasmania's energy security as summer approaches.\n\nWhile Basslink is able to make the interconnector available at 500 MW (from the sending end), Hydro Tasmania's directive will reduce availability from the National Electricity Market (NEM) on a sustained basis and lessen the competition in the NEM impacting supply and pricing, according to Basslink.\n\nBasslink is a unit of Keppel Infrastructure Trust (KIT).
