Margolies\u2019s colour photos demonstrate how the bright paint schemes, neon lighting and wild signage of roadside buildings came to be designed for maximum impact on passing drivers, enticing them in for a cold drink, a refuel, or a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nPhoto: John Margolies, Library of Congress\n\nAccording to the Library of Congress blurb, Margolies took these photos as part of an attempt the capture the \u201cvernacular architecture\u201d of the American roadside, which he considered to be threatened by modern architectural trends. Margolies\u2019s efforts were considered an important step in cultivating a Postmodern approach towards architecture and he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 1978 in recognition of his contributions.\n\nPhoto: John Margolies, Library of Congress\n\nThe photos are simple, keeping the subjects centred and the colours intentionally saturated. Margolies, whose background was more in architecture than photography, took these photos with a basic Canon camera, 50 mm lens, and ASA 25 mm film.\n\nPhoto: John Margolies, Library of Congress\n\nThe Library of Congress digitised these photos in 2016 after Margolies passed at 76. I\u2019ve collected a few of my favourites here, but the entire collection is available for view on the Library of Congress\u2019s Flickr account here.", "description": "John Margolies spent more than forty years travelling American roads and cataloguing the way cars shaped America's built environment.
