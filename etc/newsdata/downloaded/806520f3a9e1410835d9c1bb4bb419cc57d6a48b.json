They mock you and tell you in detail how much you\u2019re missing out on because aise kaise ho sakta hai, right?\n\nHow can anyone not like golgappas? I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble of \u2018Bhaiya aur teekha\u2019 and \u2018Sookhi papdis\u2019 but it\u2019s not exactly a very fine culinary invention.\n\nAlso, it is absolutely okay to dislike things other people are fond of but for some godforsaken reason, hating on golgappas doesn\u2019t go down well with people; just like golgappas don\u2019t go down well with my digestive system (read: diarrhoea).\n\nEver since I was a kid, the smell and the taste has repulsed me to the point that my friends stopped hanging out with me because I would present them with facts about the dish, facts that prove how unhygienic the dish is.\n\nDon't Miss 8.8 K SHARES 263 SHARES 155 SHARES 118 SHARES\n\nAur ek toh har state mein naam change ho jata hai par hygiene level woh hi rehta hai. No thanks, but I'm not a big fan of IBS.\n\n\u201cHow can you not like golgappas man? Are you even Indian?\u201d \u201cThere is something wrong with your taste palette.\u201d \u201cGolgappas are the best. You\u2019re a weirdo.\u201d\n\nThese are just some statements that I\u2019ve been attacked with all my life. Okay, first of all, can we stop treating the fried hollow ball from hell like it\u2019s our national dish? Secondly, not liking golgappas doesn\u2019t make me a weirdo. It just means I value my stomach\u2019s well-being more than others.\n\nTo be honest, it\u2019s not even just the hygiene I\u2019m concerned about. I mean, not knowing where all the 'teekha pani' comes from and the dirty hands of the golgappa-seller are secondary issues, of course. But I find the whole concept of the dish repulsive. It\u2019s like I\u2019m the only active member of the \u2018I hate golgappas\u2019 club.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if my taste buds don\u2019t find a fried ball of atta filled with questionable, flavoured water delectable but don\u2019t penalise me for it. Ek toh itni anxiety hoti hai khaate-khaate. There\u2019s a golgappa in your mouth, one in your hand and the guy already has the next one ready. I\u2019m sorry but life did not prepare me for this.\n\nThe way golgappa lovers come to attack me when I diss the dish is like they are part of a cult.\n\nNo thanks, but the devil of 'atta/sooji' forgot to send me an invite, and I think I\u2019m good.\n\nAur ek toh galat jagah pe galat naam lelo toh aise upar chadh jate hain jaise ki Oxford dictionary mein added hai yeh words. \u201cIt\u2019s not golgappa here okay? It\u2019s phuchka!\u201d\n\nJeez, relax. Jo bhi ho, hai toh inedible. Not just the people, even the golgappa-seller judges me like I\u2019m missing out on his fine supply of India\u2019s favourite snack. \"Madam, aapko nahi chahiye?\" So, while my friends line up next to the stall like people line up at Rajiv Chowk, I stand on the side, awkwardly waiting for them to get done with it.\n\nThe worst is when they constantly offer me every golgappa that is placed in their bowl and I shake my head every single time. Are they under the impression that I'll change my mind suddenly and decide to join in on the fun?\n\nIf I want to upset my stomach, I'd rather have some coffee. At least, I'll get a kick out of that.", "description": "Disliking golgappas doesn't make me odd. It just makes me someone who is concerned about the well-being of my bowel movements. Stop mocking me for disliking something everyone loves because guess what?
