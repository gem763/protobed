Starring: March\u00e1nt Davis, Anna Kendrick, Danielle Brooks and Denis O\u2019Hare. 15 cert, 88 mins\n\nChris Morris has made a career in finding the absurdity in the things we\u2019re reluctant to talk about. Who could ever forget Brass Eye\u2019s notorious \u201cPaedogeddon\u201d special? Its ruthless lampooning of the UK media\u2019s moral panic over paedophilia saw him, in return, get labelled as the \u201cMost Hated Man in Britain\u201d. Since the release of his debut film, Four Lions, back in 2009, Morris has been relatively quiet, outside of directing a handful of episodes of US comedy Veep. It\u2019s strange, then, to see him return with a film as muted as The Day Shall Come. Though it\u2019s silly and as angry with the world as you\u2019d expect, it never quite digs its claws in.\n\nFirst off, the film\u2019s protagonist is much less conflicted than the jihadists of Four Lions. Moses Al Shabaz (March\u00e1nt Davis), a black preacher leading the Star of Six commune, is driven by pure delusion. Although his commitment to overthrow the \u201caccidental dominance of the white man\u201d sounds like a straightforward case of historical justice, his methods are more unusual. Having rejected guns, since they\u2019re what \u201cwhite men gave us to destroy each other\u201d, he hopes that it\u2019s the CIA\u2019s secret cabal of dinosaurs that will rise up and help them out. At least, that\u2019s what God told him, talking through a duck.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMoses lives in Miami, his home set against a skyline littered with cranes \u2013 the signals of encroaching gentrification. But Morris, who co-wrote the script with Succession\u2019s Jesse Armstrong, doesn\u2019t seem particularly interested in any truth buried within Moses\u2019s campaign. His focus is instead on the FBI who, in turn, are focused on Moses and the Star of Six. Kendra Glack (Anna Kendrick), a young operative looking to impress, is trying to convince her colleagues that he\u2019s the ideal target for the department\u2019s favourite form of dirty-dealing: deliberately coercing persons of interest into breaking the law so that they can arrest them, charge them as domestic terrorists, and tick another box.\n\nThe dialogue in these scenes would certainly feel at home in an episode of Veep or In the Loop, though the jokes are never quite as cutting or as memorable, despite the ferocity with which Denis O\u2019Hare, playing Glack\u2019s boss, delivers them. There is, at least, a streak of genuine anger to the film when it comes to the way black individuals are treated as disposable assets. It helps that Davis turns in such a strong performance, finding a sweetness to Moses\u2019s desperation to keep his minuscule community from falling apart. These people are his family, as much as they are his followers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 20 Best British Films Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Local Hero Eccentric Texan oil magnate Burt Lancaster despatches an underling to buy an entire Scottish coastal village so he can build a refinery, but his man is soon seduced by his new environment. Full of Ealingesque charm and whimsy, but as the stooshie over a certain golf course in Aberdeenshire has shown, remarkably prescient, Local Hero followed the director\u2019s equally engaging Gregory\u2019s Girl into movie fans\u2019 hearts. Mark Knopfler\u2019s winning score adds to the feel-good vibe of a movie that leaves you with a great big smile on your face. Alamy Stock Photo 2/20 19. Withnail and I A British movie that inspired a student drinking game and has its many hilarious lines quoted verbatim by fans (\u201cDon\u2019t you threaten me with a dead fish!\u201d, etc.) must have something going for it, and Withnail and I certainly does. Paul McGann and a marvellously wasted and acerbic Richard E Grant make the most of Robinson\u2019s terrific semi-autobiographical script of two base, out of work actors who drown themselves in a diet of booze, pills and lighter fluid on a disastrous holiday in the country circa 1969. The whole movie is basically one long bender followed by the mother of all hangovers (\u201cLook at my tongue, it\u2019s wearing a yellow sock\u201d) and stands as a perfect flip side of the so-called swinging Sixties. Alamy Stock Photo 3/20 18. The Bridge over the River Kwai This celebrated prisoner of war epic is set in Japanese-occupied Burma with Alec Guinness as the British colonel obsessed with building the titular bridge. Colonel Nicholson\u2019s reasoning is if his men can build the best bridge they can, it will lift their morale and show the brutal camp commandant that the British soldier is superior to the Japanese \u2013 but he is oblivious that in doing so, he may be aiding the enemy. As much a battle of wills as a great action movie, this perennial television favourite won seven Oscars including best film, best director for Lean and best actor for Guinness. Columbia 4/20 17. The Ladykillers Criminal mastermind Alec Guinness rents a room in a sweet old lady\u2019s house (a scene-stealing Katie Johnson) while he and his gang masquerade as musicians, plotting and executing a daring robbery. When the indomitable old lady learns the truth and threatens to reveal all to the police, the gang decide they have to do away with her. They then argue over who is going to do the dirty deed and only end up offing themselves in a series of gruesome but highly amusing vignettes. Scottish director Mackendrick was soon to depart for the USA to make the very dark, noirish Sweet Smell of Success and this peerless black comedy was his final film at Ealing and a fitting swansong for one of the studio\u2019s finest talents. 5/20 16. A Clockwork Orange From the Anthony Burgess novel, Kubrick\u2019s scathing satire set in a dystopian society in the not too distant future predictably caused controversy on release and has continued to do so through the subsequent decades, with one reviewer accusing Kubrick of making \u201cintellectual pornography\u201d. Disturbed by reports that the stylised violence in the film had provoked copycat crimes, Kubrick withdrew the film in Britain in 1973, and it wasn\u2019t made available again until 2000, a year after his death. Even now, A Clockwork Orange still divides opinions, and as the recent revival demonstrated, in an era when audiences have long been conditioned to extreme violence on film, hasn\u2019t lost the power to shock, while still raising as many questions as answers about morality, free will, and authority. 6/20 15. Get Carter The opening title sequence of Get Carter finds Michael Caine as Jack Carter on board the London to Newcastle train reading Raymond Chandler\u2019s Farewell, My Lovely. But Carter is no Philip Marlowe knight errant. He\u2019s an ice-cold enforcer for a London crime mob returning home to Newcastle, hell-bent on finding out how his brother died. In doing so, amid a web of corruption, pornography and murder, the relentless Carter leaves a trail of bodies all around the northeast, but his own fate had already been sealed when he stepped aboard that train. Brutally realistic and reflecting the growing pessimism of the early 1970s, Get Carter was underappreciated on release and then grew into a cult film. Now, it is viewed as one of the most influential British crime thrillers ever. TCD/VP/LMKMEDIA 7/20 14. Brief Encounter Two happily married people meet by chance at a railway station and a short, intense, but doomed love affair ensues. Gloriously old fashioned romance from Noel Coward\u2019s one-act play, full of classic British restraint and stiff upper lips. The cut-glass accents and some of the dialogue may grate nowadays but the poignancy of the story, the superb performances by Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, the trains and the unforgettable use of Rachmaninoff\u2019s second piano concerto make for an enduring classic. ITV Studios 8/20 13. Barry Lyndon Boasting sumptuous production values, this exquisitely mounted, leisurely paced adaption of William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s novel about the rise and fall of an 18th-century Irish rogue hero received middling reviews when first released but still won four Oscars, including not surprisingly, the costume, cinematography, and art direction categories; for Barry Lyndon is undoubtedly one of the most stunningly beautiful pictures ever made. Kubrick shot all but a few scenes by natural light and candlelight, investing the film with the authentic look of the period and evoking the works of Gainsborough and Hogarth \u2013 exactly the look that Kubrick desired. Like other films in the Kubrick canon that originally bypassed the critics, Barry Lyndon is now recognised for its true worth. Invest three hours of your life in viewing it and you will not be disappointed. Rex Features 9/20 12. Great Expectations A wonderful achievement by Lean who managed to distil and transfer the long, intricately plotted novel from the page to the screen without losing any of the narrative flow. Featuring an exemplary cast, Oscar-winning cinematography and a number of unforgettable scenes such as the opening graveyard sequence, the first glimpse of Miss Havisham in her wedding dress, and the moonlit pursuit of Magwitch across the marshes, this is the Dickens adaption against which all others should be measured. Alamy Stock Photo 10/20 11. Trainspotting More than two decades on, Trainspotting\u2019s rampage through Edinburgh\u2019s heroin culture remains terrifying, shockingly funny, horrifying and heartbreaking in equal measure. In a uniformly brilliant cast, Ewan McGregor gives a career-defining performance as Renton, and Robert Carlyle\u2019s Begbie is terrifyingly but compulsively watchable. Trainspotting was criticised in some quarters for glamorising drug-taking. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 think of the scenes involving the minutiae of actually scoring and taking drugs as well as the harrowing cold turkey sequence, but Trainspotting does challenge audiences on the reasons why people do, whether we emphathise or not. Alamy 11/20 10. Lawrence of Arabia Lawrence of Arabia shot Peter O\u2019Toole to fame, but he had to fight the desert every inch of the way as the star of one of the most beautifully photographed films ever made, with David Lean stunningly sealing his status as one of the great visual directors. Think of the famous shot of Omar Sharif miles in the distance gradually coming into view through the haze of the desert sun, and the epic sweep of Freddie Young\u2019s Oscar-winning cinematography throughout. Winner of six other Oscars including best film, best director and for Maurice Jarre\u2019s unforgettable score, Lawrence of Arabia is that rarest of beasts \u2013 an epic blockbuster that is also thoughtful and literate. Rex Features 12/20 9. Monty Python's Life of Brian Praise be to George Harrison for putting up the money when EMI pulled out, thus ensuring that the Python\u2019s satire on organised religion and blind faith saw the light of day. The fall out over the alleged blasphemy in the film couldn\u2019t overshadow just how funny and on the money The Life of Brian was, and just made more and more people want to view it, making it even more successful than it would have been. The Python\u2019s finest hour (and a half). Rex 13/20 8. Kes A beautifully filmed adaption of the Barry Hines novel A Kestral For a Knave with a remarkable performance from David Bradley as Billy Casper, a 15-year-old boy from a deprived background whose life is transformed when he finds a young falcon and trains it, in the process forming a close emotional bond with the bird. There\u2019s comedy and tragedy in equal measure in Kes, with the hilarious football scene with Brian Glover as both referee and Bobby Charlton and the heartbreaking ending demonstrating Loach\u2019s devastating gift for both. The cast of the mostly non-professional actors wasn\u2019t told what to expect in many of the scenes, hence the real shock and pain on the boys\u2019 faces when they were caned by the bullying headmaster. With Chris Menges\u2019 superb camerawork lit only by natural light, Kes remains a true British classic and the peak of Loach\u2019s illustrious body of work. Alamy Stock Photo 14/20 7. The 39 Steps John Buchan\u2019s famous novel has a rather anti-climactic ending and there are no female characters, so the director put his own personal stamp on it. The result is Hitchcock\u2019s first true classic bursting with what would become the Master\u2019s signature tropes \u2013 famous locations, the glacial blonde, the innocent man on the run and the (literally) memorable climax. The 39 Steps also features one of the first examples of the director\u2019s MacGuffin, his celebrated plot device (in this case military secrets being taken out of the country by agents of a foreign power) that, on the one hand, drives the film but on the other, has little relevance to the outcome. There isn\u2019t a wasted moment in the entire film with a dream pairing in dashing Robert Donat and icily beautiful Madeleine Carroll. Alamy Stock Photo 15/20 6. Distance Voices, Still Lives Distant Voices, Still Lives is a wonderful semi-autobiographical chronicle of a 1940s/50s working-class Liverpool family which received a 4k restoration last year, reminding us of the beauty and fine detail of the director\u2019s art. Davies movingly and lyrically contrasts the hardships of everyday life living in the shadow of a brutal husband and father with the small pleasures and little victories \u2013 weddings, visits to the cinema and sing-songs down the pub. Pete Postlethwaite\u2019s performance as the abusive head of the family is seared on the memory while Freda Dowie excels as his stoical wife, and Davies\u2019s use of period music in the film is perfection. Alamy Stock Photo 16/20 5. The Red Shoes The Red Shoes is even darker than the Hans Christian Anderson original, with a radiant Moira Shearer in her first film as the young ballerina torn by the conflicting demands of her Svengali-like dance master and her struggling composer lover. The wonderful score and stunning sets won Oscars but Jack Cardiff\u2019s sumptuous technicolour cinematography somehow didn\u2019t even get nominated. This is the perfect example of Powell and Pressburger\u2019s unique vision and arguably the finest synthesis of dance, music and drama ever committed to film. Alamy Stock Photo 17/20 4. Don't Look Now Rarely has a city been used so effectively in cinema than in Roeg\u2019s adaption of the Daphne Du Maurier short story Don\u2019t Look Now, which has grown in stature over the past four decades. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland are superb as a grieving couple who go to Venice to try and forget the death by drowning of their daughter, only to experience disturbing reminders of their daughter. Both a Hitchcock influenced supernatural chiller and a highly emotional study of love and loss, Don\u2019t Look Now exudes mystery and menace thanks to Roeg\u2019s stunning use of Venetian locations as he masterfully and inexorably builds the suspense until the shocking climax. Alamy Stock Photo 18/20 3. Kind Hearts and Coronets Alec Guinness famously and brilliantly played eight different characters in this pitch-black comedy of manners, but he is matched all the way by a wonderfully urbane and detached Dennis Price as the serial killer who murders his way to a dukedom. The film mercilessly takes barbed shots at the aristocracy and class divide, and the talented but troubled Hamer directs with a sureness of touch that does full justice to the billboards declaring Kind Hearts \u201ca hilarious study of the gentle art of murder\u201d. Price\u2019s gentle voiceover and the savage twist in the tale are the icing on the cake in a film with no room for sentiment or remorse, and which remains the high watermark in the Ealing canon. Alamy Stock Photo 19/20 2. A Matter of Life and Death Yet another unique film from Powell and Pressburger, this is a technically brilliant fantasy starring David Niven as a young pilot in the Second World War who cheats death just as he falls in love with radio operator Kim Hunter, and must stand trial in a heavenly court (or is the court in his own mind?) for his life on earth to continue. In a reversal of existing tropes, heaven was filmed in black and white and earth in glorious technicolour, and there are some stunning special effects that even now, impress. Ultimately the power of love triumphs over fate in one of Martin Scorsese\u2019s favourite films which, coming at the end of the war, can also be viewed as a plea for more tolerance and understanding between nations. Alamy Stock Photo 20/20 1. The Third Man From The Third Man\u2019s humble beginnings (Graham Greene scribbled a single line for the beginning of a story on the back of an envelope), Greene and Carol Reed crafted a masterpiece of a thriller centring around moral ambiguity and betrayed friendships and containing some of the most memorable moments in cinema history. Evocatively photographed by Robert Krasker, post-war Vienna becomes as much a star of the movie as the two principal actors, as hack-writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) searches for his friend Harry Lime, insouciantly played by Orson Welles in the rubble-strewn city. The last scene in the film when Anna walks past Martins in the cemetery. And of course, the famous zither score. It all adds up to one inescapable conclusion. Seventy years since it was first released, The Third Man is Britain\u2019s greatest film. Alamy Stock Photo 1/20 20.
