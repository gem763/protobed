If not, the top two candidates will head to a runoff on Nov. 24.\n\nThe election comes against the backdrop of an economic and currency crisis, with voters concerned about the cost of living and access to social services. The government is seeking to renegotiate the terms of more than $100 billion in debt, and the chances of a sovereign default are rising.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nTurnout was higher than an August primary vote won by FernandezRead more: Fernandez Leads in Argentine Presidential Election, TN TV SaysRead more: The Man Who Would Be Argentina\u2019s President Terrifies Investors\n\nWaiting for the leaders to speak (10:17 p.m.)\n\nOver an hour after the first official results were released -- with 88% of the votes now counted -- and neither Fernandez nor Macri have commented. This is somewhat unexpected at this point in the evening and perhaps reflects how the margin is tighter than forecast. Latest numbers show Fernandez ahead with almost 48% of the vote, vs 41% for Macri.\n\nThird party candidates squeezed out in vote (9:48 p.m.)\n\nFernandez and Macri between them account for 89% of all votes. No space for third parties -- the other four candidates are nowhere near the action. The big question now is how the two of them react to these numbers. Will they use their support to try to find common ground in the legislature on the big issues Argentina has to face?\n\nWith 84% of the vote counted, Fernandez is sitting on 48% and Macri is still on 41%.\n\nOfficial results put Fernandez ahead (9:03 p.m.)\n\nThe official count from the election commission shows Fernandez is ahead but the race is tighter than expected (and an improvement for Macri from an August primary, where the split was 16 percentage points). With 70% of the vote counted, Fernandez has 47% against Macri on 41%. That\u2019s enough for him to win as long as he holds over 45%.\n\nVote count hits the legal threshold for release (8:38 p.m.)\n\nArgentina\u2019s electoral authority says at least 10% of votes have already been processed for the country\u2019s top four districts, fulfilling a legal obligation set by a judge earlier Sunday. That means the official results can start to be released at 9 p.m. local time, as expected. Stay tuned.\n\nFernandez spotted toasting with close aides (8:25 p.m.)\n\nTN TV network has aired images of Alberto Fernandez in his flat celebrating with close advisers after the close of ballots, showing them toasting with red wine and chanting against Macri. The opposition is struggling to hide the euphoria less than an hour before official results.\n\n\u201cAll the exit polls indicate that Macri increased significantly, but Fernandez also grew, so a runoff seems highly unlikely at this stage,\u201d says Jimena Blanco, political research director at consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft. Still, she says, the fact Macri appears to have mobilized more voters is a warning to Fernandez not to move too far to the left on policies.\n\nCentral Bank board to meet later Sunday (7:42 p.m.)\n\nArgentina\u2019s central bank board will meet later tonight once the election results are known, a person with knowledge of the matter tells Ignacio Olivera Doll. There\u2019s been speculation that new economic measures will be announced before the market opens on Monday. The central bank\u2019s reserves tumbled almost $4 billion last week, and while part of that is to pay government debt, long lines were visible on Friday outside some commercial bank branches in downtown Buenos Aires.\n\nVoter turnout rises to more than 80% (7:21 p.m.)\n\nAbout 81% of eligible voters cast ballots, according to a tweet by the electoral authority, an increase from the more than 75% who voted in an August primary, which was in essence a giant opinion poll before the actual election. That\u2019s one of the conditions Macri needs to have a chance in this election: that voters who didn\u2019t come out in August would do so now and support him. It\u2019s similar to the first round turnout of the 2015 election and short of the record of almost 86% in the 1983 presidential vote.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez leads business-friendly incumbent Mauricio Macri by seven percentage points in Sunday\u2019s Argentine presidential vote, the official count shows.For an outright win, Fernandez, a left-leaning populist, needs 45% of votes, or at least 40% with a 10 percentage", "authors": ["Patrick Gillespie", "Jorgelina Do Rosario"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K9z9Sy1n__g.neGOX4UHhw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/b063a6dab0db4ced796cf3ce84b7017f", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
