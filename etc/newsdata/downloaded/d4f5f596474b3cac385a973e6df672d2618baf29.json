So, hurrah for Sarah, Duchess of York who today, less than a week away from her 60th birthday, gives us an honest insight into the help she\u2019s had in holding back the clock. The Duchess has fair skin, impressively few grey hairs and is prone to wrinkles, but looked surprisingly well at her daughter Princess Eugenie\u2019s wedding to Jack Brooksbank last year.\n\nWas it just maternal pride that made her skin glow as she walked up the steps at St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor, for her younger daughter\u2019s big day? Or was there a bit of something else, besides?\n\nIn a shocking interview the Duchess of York revealed that she has relied on botox, organic fillers, vitamin injections, a laser facelift AND a threadlift to maintain her appearance\n\nThe former wife of Prince Andrew, Sarah, pictured in 2012 (left) and in 2013 (right) after receiving a vitamin injection to plump up the skin\n\nBoth says Sarah. Speaking exclusively to the Mail, she confesses: \u2018The happiness was shining out of me because my daughter was getting married. I was so glad. I love Jack. When I\u2019m passionate about anything, my eyes shine.\n\n\u2018Above all, it was being joyful for Eugenie that made me look good. But I\u2019d had some laser treatment on my face which helped, too.\u2019\n\nThe laser treatment comes with extraordinary claims. It purports to be everything we\u2019d wish from a cosmetic pro-cedure: pain-free, non-invasive, with no recovery time and accomplished in no more than 90 minutes.\n\nThe woman behind the Duchess\u2019s treatment is Polish-born Dr Gabriela Mercik, who at her Harley Street clinic, has just launched what she calls the world\u2019s first 6-Dimension Ultimate Laser Treatment facelift.\n\nWhat does 6-Dimension mean? \u2018We wanted a unique name to show we\u2019re pioneering things,\u2019 says Dr Gabriela\u2019s son Greg, 29, an IT graduate, who\u2019s trained to carry out non-invasive procedures. \u2018People have heard of 3D glasses \u2014 we wanted to go a step beyond that.\u2019\n\nThe royal goes to Harley Street doctor Gabriela Mercik, who offers a six-dimensional ultimate laser treatment facelift for more than \u00a33,000\n\nThe Duchess and Dr Gabriela met in 1992 when Sarah was visiting young cancer victims in Upper Silesia, Poland. The doctor, then a medical student, was helping to treat them.\n\nThey\u2019ve stayed in touch. \u2018I\u2019m very loyal to my friends,\u2019 says the Duchess. When Dr Gabriela moved into aesthetic medicine, and opened her clinic, firstly in Northern Ireland, and then in London, Sarah became one of her patients.\n\nIt was being joyful for Eugenie that made me look good. But I\u2019d had some laser treatment on my face which helped, too\n\nDr Gabriela has treated Sarah with her rejuvenating facial procedures every time the Duchess has managed to sit still for long enough, since.\n\n\u2018I live on jingly-jangly nerves. I\u2019m very focused, earnestly intense, but I live at high speed,\u2019 explains Sarah. \u2018I don\u2019t sit down for long. I\u2019m always saying to Dr Gabriela: \u201cCome on, come on! Hurry up!\u201d I\u2019m the worst patient.\u2019\n\nSo it\u2019s just as well her \u2018ultimate laser facelift\u2019 as it\u2019s called, is a quick treatment which can be accomplished in a lunch-hour.\n\nThe facelift, which purports to promote the skin\u2019s natural production of youth-restoring collagen, is said to continue to work as the weeks pass.\n\nThe former wife to Prince Andrew also revealed that she deployed laser treatment on her face to make sure she looked her best for Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank last year (pictured on the day with Princess Beatrice of York)\n\nFergie pictured left in 2012 and right at daughter Eugenie's wedding after receiving several treatments to help stave off the effects of aging\n\nThe Duchess much prefers it to Botox, the botulinum toxin injections that relax the muscles in your face to smooth out lines and wrinkles. \u2018I had Botox a long time ago when there was nothing else available,\u2019 says the Duchess.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s pass\u00e9 now,\u2019 says Dr Gabriela. \u2018Now we have different treatments we can use instead. Toxins are always toxins, so I\u2019ve looked for alternatives. I only use Botox if a patient specifically asks for it, and I try to explain what would be better.\u2019\n\nDr Gabriela first met the Princess in 1992, when she visited cancer victims in Upper Silesia, Poland, where the doctor was a medical student\n\n\u2018I really don\u2019t like the frozen look,\u2019 puts in Sarah. \u2018I\u2019m so animated and I like to be myself. I don\u2019t like the thought of needles and am very glad if I look well and happy.\u2019\n\nThe Duchess also uses Dr Gabriela\u2019s skincare range of serums and unguents.\n\n\u2018Her serum (Aesthetic Magic Facelift Serum) is great for healing cold sores. Incredible,\u2019 says Sarah. \u2018I\u2019ve been her guinea pig with new treatments, too. I\u2019m really happy to be open about what I\u2019ve had done.\u2019\n\nSarah began having mesotherapy \u2014 an injection of vitamins, minerals and amino acids under the face\u2019s mesodermal layer to plump skin \u2014 in 2013, then moved onto organic fillers, non-invasive injectables that fill out facial lines.\n\nThen, five years ago, Dr Gabriela proposed a thread lift. Also called \u2018a puppet lift\u2019, this involves no knives. Instead, medical threads are inserted into the skin to create a supportive mesh that pulls the face upwards.\n\nThe threads dissolve over six to eight months, but the results should last for two years. Dr Gabriela was one of the first to introduce the thread lift to the UK in 2013 and travels around the world teaching the procedure.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like garden trellising for sweat peas. You insert the threads under the skin with a fine needle and they hold everything up,\u2019 says Sarah.\n\nSarah photographed at a glamorous exhibition opening in May in Toronto, Canada\n\nSarah with Princess Eugenie at The Beatles 50th anniversary event in London in 2017\n\n\u2018They also encourage collagen production. It takes a couple of months, then the sweet peas bloom!\u2019 she adds. \u2018Before I had it done I thought, \u201cOh this is going to be painful,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t bad. My skin responded well. I think if you look at photos of me after I had it done, I look much better.\u2019\n\n\u2018We inserted nano peptides (synthetic growth factors) under the skin which, with the synthetic threads, stimulate collagen production,\u2019 explains Dr Gabriela. \u2018But now we\u2019ve swapped the threads for laser because it\u2019s non-invasive.\u2019\n\nSarah confides that she hopes the laser treatment will help her look her best for her 60th birthday next Tuesday.\n\nDr Gabriela says a multitude of factors determine how long treatments last and how many are necessary. \u2018If you\u2019re aged 40 to 50 you might need two or three to get optimum results. Other factors come into play: lifestyle, smoking, environment, the colour of your skin, whether you dance all night \u2026 The Duchess is a challenge because redheads have more sensitive skin.\u2019\n\nPrices for the 6D laser lift start at \u00a33,750. Sarah has and does pay for treatments \u2018at Dr Gabriela\u2019s discretion,\u2019 given that they have become friends.\n\nSarah is wearing heels \u2014 black faux croc stilettos \u2014 which show off her slim ankles. When we met last year she was in flats because high heels were so painful (she reminds me how relieved she was to flump down in her pew and rest her feet at Eugenie\u2019s wedding).\n\nSarah photographed smiling at the Grosvenor House Hotel in June this year\n\nToday, she reveals she has since had pioneering regenerative stem cell therapy on her feet.\n\n\u2018I went to the Bahamas in March to have the treatment,\u2019 she says, proffering a Cinderella-sized foot for inspection. \u2018I think my toes were ruined by all the riding I did when I was young. They shaved the bone here,\u2019 she indicates the spot by her big toe, \u2018and implanted stem cells \u2014 20 million of them taken from my midriff \u2014 into my feet to make new cartilage.\n\n\u2018It takes about six months to heal but now I can walk in heels!\u2019\n\nStem cell therapies, an alternative to surgery, are fashionable, but not yet fully proven to be safe and effective. Consequently, they are not widely available in the UK.\n\nDr Gabriela adds that she has reservations about the indiscriminate use of scalpels on the face.\n\n\u2018I have a duty to educate women that it\u2019s very important to stop having cosmetic surgery because the trauma isn\u2019t good,\u2019 she says.\n\nDr Gabriela, who appears to do her treatments while wearing a neck scarf, pearls, and a suit, gives a 6D laser treatment to Irish hat maker Grainne Maher\n\nAnd the doctor pictured with Grainne Maher after the surgery has been completed\n\nShe adds that she first learned about minimally-invasive techniques when she was a medical school student at the Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, Poland.\n\nThere, in the early Nineties, the centre began inserting stents, using guide wires under the skin, to open the heart vessels, instead of conventional heart surgery.\n\n\u2018It was revolutionary in cardiology at the time,\u2019 says Dr Gabriela, \u2018and it made me think about applying similar ideas to aesthetic medicine. Surgery and anaesthesia carry risks. And why should a facelift make us look like a starched sheet?\u2019\n\nThe Duchess admits that her fine, fair skin was exposed to far too much sunshine when she was a child.\n\n\u2018When I was little, my mother thought Nivea moisturiser was sunscreen. Of course it wasn\u2019t. So that\u2019s where the damage began.\n\n\u2018My father [Major Ronald Ferguson], who died in 2003, had melanoma [skin cancer], and my best friend Carolyn Cotterell [who shared a house with Fergie in the mid-Eighties] also died of a malignant melanoma. She was 43. It made me realise you have to look after your skin just as much as your other organs. It isn\u2019t just about aesthetics. We have to think about our skin health.\n\nThe Duchess pictured arriving in Cannes on a yacht wearing a flowing red dress\n\nThe Duchess in 2009 with her daughters Princess Eugenie (left) and Princess Beatrice (right) attending a Young Victoria performance in Toronto, Canada\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why I don\u2019t go in the sun now. The tan I have is out of a bottle. Fake.\n\n\u2018I need to repair the damage that was done on the beach when I was a child. It\u2019s why I had the mesotherapy, the vitamin cocktail to hydrate and boost the skin. I\u2019ve started the laser treatment, but it\u2019s not finished yet. The collagen needs to rebuild. I hope it will all be done by my birthday.\u2019\n\n\u2018We have quite a lot of sun damage to repair,\u2019 tuts Dr Gabriela, who says she used to be a hospital doctor, but following a stint in cardiology \u2014 first in Poland then Northern Ireland \u2014 decided to change course after she had breast cancer.\n\n\u2018I had always been interested in art and aesthetics, so I went to a conference on aesthetic medicine and that was it,\u2019 she explains.\n\nShe is evangelistic about lasers and their diverse functions, telling me she successfully treated her son\u2019s terrible acne (how mortified the poor chap must be!), which had failed to respond to even the strongest antibiotics.\n\nShe also insisted her husband Donald, 55, whose baggy eyes were not a good advert for her business, used her serum.\n\n\u2018I said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re my business card! People will look at you and say, \u201cShe can\u2019t fix her husband.\u201d He\u2019s always outside riding and he\u2019s got a lot of sun damage. But now I\u2019ve started laser treatment on him and look!\u2019\n\nShe produces two photos: one of baggy, rheumy-eyed Donald and another of him looking (admittedly) spryer and wide-eyed.\n\nIt seems there is no end to lasers\u2019 applications: originally developed by scientists working in the Russian Military Secret Service for use in intelligence, defence and optical communications, they were later adapted for medical use, for surgery, dentistry and gynaecology.\n\nDr Gabriela promises the Duchess that she will look \u2014 discreetly \u2014 more youthful by the day, as if the ageing process was being reversed bit-by-bit, by stealth.\n\nBy the time she turns 60, she should look subtly younger.
