LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Washington Nationals right-hander An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez lost his no-hit bid with two outs in the eighth inning on a clean single by St. Louis Cardinals pinch-hitter Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series.\n\nMart\u00ednez lined an 82 mph split-finger fastball into center field, spoiling S\u00e1nchez\u2019s shot at the third no-hitter in postseason history. Two batters earlier, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman preserved the bid by diving to catch a line drive by Tommy Edman.\n\nNationals manager Dave Mart\u00ednez pulled S\u00e1nchez after the hit and brought in left-hander Sean Doolittle. S\u00e1nchez struck out five, hit two batters and walked one on 103 pitches. The right-handed S\u00e1nchez waved to standing fans in St. Louis as he left the field.\n\nDoolittle pitched cleanly out of the eighth to preserve a 2-0 lead. The Nationals are without closer Daniel Hudson, who was placed on paternity leave earlier Friday.\n\nS\u00e1nchez retired his first 10 batters before Kolten Wong walked in the fourth for St. Louis\u2019 first baserunner. He stole second and went to third on catcher Yan Gomes\u2019 throwing error, but Marcell Ozuna fouled out to end the inning.\n\nS\u00e1nchez got a break in the fifth when Matt Carpenter tipped a 1-2 pitch that bounced off the dirt and into Gomes\u2019 mitt. Carpenter briefly argued the ball wasn\u2019t caught cleanly, but it was ruled a strikeout \u2014 that play can\u2019t be reviewed.\n\nThe 35-year-old S\u00e1nchez pitched a no-hitter as a rookie with the Florida Marlins in 2006. He also threw six hitless innings in the opener of the 2013 AL Championship Series for Detroit against Boston but was pulled after 116 pitches. The Tigers bullpen finished a one-hitter in a 1-0 victory.\n\nDon Larsen threw a perfect game for the New York Yankees against Brooklyn in the 1956 World Series, and Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter for the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2010 NL Division Series.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "ST.
