He directed viewers to his campaign website, which said in white block text, \u201cWIN $1,000 A MONTH,\u201d and below, in parentheses, \u201cNo strings attached.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpromotion period,\u201d according to the campaign website, started Thursday at 8 p.m. Eastern time and ends on Sept. 19, 11:59 p.m. Eastern time\n\nNews of Yang\u2019s plan elicited giggles from his opponents, GIFs and jokes galore on social media, and several legitimate concerns on legality.\n\nThe \u201cpromotion,\u201d which his campaign teased under the banner #YangsDebateSurprise ahead of Thursday\u2019s debate, is part of a pilot program for his trademark proposal for a universal basic income, called the Freedom Dividend. The policy would give every American over the age of 18 a thousand dollars a month, no matter their employment status.\n\n\u201cWe have to get our country working for us again instead of the other way around,\u201d said Yang, a Washington outsider who has outlasted two governors, a senator and two members of the House. \u201cIt\u2019s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.\u201d\n\ni speak for all asian-americans when I say my mom would like to hear more from the asian guy and how to win his $1000 per month prize#DemocraticDebate #asians #money \u2014 Dan Nguyen (@dancow) September 13, 2019\n\nYang has already been paying $1,000 a month to three families, one in Iowa, another in New Hampshire, and a third in Florida. After inquiries from reporters about the legality of the payouts, Yang, who funded the contributions himself, reported them as gifts on his campaign finance reports. It\u2019s unclear how the expansion of the plan would work.\n\nOn the debate state, Yang\u2019s announcement was met with titters from several other candidates. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who spoke after Yang, said, \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that.\"\n\nOn Twitter, Yang\u2019s plan was likened to a \u201csweepstakes\u201d \u2014 a kind of contest that people can enter free with the hopes of earning a grand prize.\n\nSome, such as celebrity lawyer and Trump foe Michael Avenatti, criticized the move as a \u201cstunt.\u201d Others tweeted GIFs of Oprah, comparing the entrepreneur to the media executive known for giving out free prizes on her television shows.\n\nAndrew Yang comes out here like Oprah #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/MlwWyo2jkv \u2014 Leslie Dennis (@lcdennis627) September 13, 2019\n\nAlexis Ohanian Sr., co-founder of the social platform Reddit, tweeted his support for the plan, writing, \u201cHey @AndrewYang I like this idea so much I\u2019ll do it personally for those 10 people if you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSeveral conservative leaders, including the president\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, suggested that Yang\u2019s plan is illegal.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission, an agency that regulates campaign finance law, bans the use of campaign funds for \u201cpersonal use,\u201d which includes expenses for a home mortgage or rent, clothing purchase, country club membership, a vacation or household food items. It is defined as funds that would be used regardless of whether that candidate was running for office or not.\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls California Sen.

(Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA spokesman for Yang\u2019s campaign said payments will be made at random to those who sign up for it on the campaign website, and that the payments are considered a campaign expense because they are \u201cbeing made to further the goals of the campaign.\u201d The campaign said they consulted with legal counsel, who approved the proposal.\n\nBut some campaign finance lawyers said they have concerns. The crux of the issue seems to boils down to language in the FEC\u2019s rules, which prohibits the personal use of campaign funds by \u201cany person.\u201d The 10 people who stand to receive Yang\u2019s dividends are likely to spend this money for personal purposes, potentially placing Yang\u2019s plan in violation of the rules.\n\n\u201cCampaign donors give their hard-earned money to fund campaign activities & the law makes clear that paying personal expenses is not a campaign activity.\" @CampaignLegal's @AdavNoti https://t.co/FAFydyL4YC \u2014 Campaign Legal Center (@CampaignLegal) September 13, 2019\n\nThe personal use prohibition has a dual purpose: to prevent corruption as well as to protect donors and make sure that their money is \u201cnot going to line anybody else\u2019s pocket other than for services provided to the campaign,\u201d said Adav Noti, a former FEC lawyer who is now chief of staff of the Campaign Legal Center, a group that advocates greater restrictions in campaign finance.\n\n\u201cTo maintain donors\u2019 faith in the system, it\u2019s important that they have some reasonable level of certainty that their money \u2014 especially small-donor money, but all money \u2014 is getting used\u201d for a campaign purpose, Noti said.\n\nIf the campaign were to make these expenditures as an exchange for services \u2014 for example, requiring recipients to make media appearances on behalf of the campaign \u2014 there may be a legal reasoning that the payments are fees for services, she added.\n\nBut the campaign said there will not be such requirements for the recipients and that the payments will not be used as fees for services.\n\n[Democrats argue over health care and other core issues \u2014 and the direction of the party]\n\nJessica Levinson, an election law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said campaign funds can be used broadly for political purposes but that writing checks to voters or supporters pushes the boundaries of what constituents a political purpose.\n\n\u201cIf the regulations were a rubber band, this would be stretching it to its extreme,\u201d Levinson said.\n\nThe FEC, which enforces campaign finance laws and regulations, recently lost its voting quorum. Without a quorum, Yang cannot seek any advisory opinions to receive guidance on whether these payments are according to law, experts said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a place where presidential candidates can start handing out checks, and it\u2019s not clear if the FEC will act in any way. Without a quorum, there\u2019s literally nothing they can do,\u201d Levinson said.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s debate, Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, also raised eyebrows when he suggested that he knows a lot of doctors because he is Asian. Some found the comment bewildering; others criticized him for reinforcing an unfair and harmful stereotype of Asian Americans as \u201cmodel minorities.\u201d\n\nAndrew Yang making a joke buying into the stereotype on Asians being doctors is a good segway into talking about 1) the dangers of perpetuating the model minority myth and 2) talking about the racial disparities in medical school admissions. Just saying. \u2014 Deepa Shivaram (@deepa_shivaram) September 13, 2019", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that,\" said South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Yang's call for people to go to Yang2020.com for a chance to receive $1,000 monthly.", "authors": ["Holly Bailey", "National Political Reporter", "Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "Michelle Ye Hee Lee", "National Political Enterprise", "Accountability Reporter Covering Money", "Influence In Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a4KjYXqe9xobfH8m5QfBG-c5gxw=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-13-2019/t_cc6f8fde89684dd1a0b2e4e111f704cc_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_49_21_Still014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
