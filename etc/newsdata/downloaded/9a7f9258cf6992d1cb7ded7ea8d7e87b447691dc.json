Affinity Equity Partners has 9.99%, GIC owns 9% and AlpInvest has 5% - each having bought their stakes from General Electric in 2017.\n\nHyundai Card, which is led by Ted Chung, brother-in-law of Hyundai Motor Group heir apparent Euisun Chung, saw its operating profit fall 22% to 202.3 billion won last year.\n\nThe company warned in August that it will be difficult to improve profitability significantly this year, citing an uncertain economic outlook and government measures to curb high household debt.\n\nIt said the country's credit card market is a mature one, with credit card payments accounting for 70% of total payments and that competition is intensifying from banks.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Card, the credit card unit of Hyundai Motor Group, said on Tuesday it has asked banks to submit proposals this month for roles in a possible initial public offering.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
