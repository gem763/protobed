The survey of some 547 real estate offices found agents identified \u201cheightened economic and political uncertainty as a contributing factor behind the sluggish picture,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\n\nMore: Four-Story Stone House in England\u2019s Posh Cotswolds Asks \u00a33.95 Million\n\nMost agents also reported a slowdown in sales and new buyer inquiries during September, according to the report.\n\n\n\nEven with a Brexit deadline officially scheduled for Oct. 31, industry professionals reported little hope for a turnaround in the near future. A majority of those surveyed said they expected prices and sales to remain flat or fall over the next three months.\n\n\n\nThe slowdown in sales and price growth has steadily spread from its previous concentration around London and Southeast England to the rest of the country. Every region in the U.K., with the exception of Northern Ireland, reported a decline in new listings in September.\n\n\n\nNorth Yorkshire estate agent T. W. Pennington, of auctioneers Northallerton Auctions Ltd., commented in the survey that political uncertainty is having a \u201cdetrimental effect on the level of new instructions in the residential market.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an estate agent indicated that the political fracas has stymied the usual influx of Londoners house hunting in Kent, a popular commuter region.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: China\u2019s Rich List Shrinks, But the Cash Pile Grows\n\n\u201cUnless there is a speedy resolution to the ongoing impasse, it does seem inevitable that the stand-off between purchasers and sellers will deepen, making it harder to complete transactions,\u201d said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist.\n\n\n\nHe added that a worsening slowdown in sales would have a knock-on effect for the national economy \u201cas the normal spend on furniture, fittings and appliances that typically accompanies a house move is also put on hold.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-115841?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
