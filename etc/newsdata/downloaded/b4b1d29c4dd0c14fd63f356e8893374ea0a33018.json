From the time I joined The Chase he's always encouraged me to push myself and to explore whatever opportunities I am given.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"That's one of the reasons I accepted the invitation to audition in the first place. I've held myself back a lot for a lack of confidence. And that situation you push yourself forward to take the challenge. It\u2019s a learning experience whatever happens.\n\n\"Brad has a record deal, he\u2019s got albums out, he\u2019s got Doctor Who, and he presents every other programme sometimes when you\u2019re watching of a weekend.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t mind me saying he\u2019s got a couple of decades on me. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got the energy to keep that going.\"\n\n(Image: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX)\n\n(Image: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX)\n\nAsked whether she knew she could sing before, Jenny said: \"I always enjoyed singing but I was never convinced that I had a big voice like that, that was distinctive, I just thought I can sing in the choir, bits of AmDram, Gilbert & Sullivan society and nerdy things like that.\n\n\"Someone who gave me a lot of confidence was my friend Martin Taylor, he\u2019s the most famous man in Bolton.\n\n\"He is a pianist and used to play in one of the local pubs. He would sing everything from classical to rock to pop. He was amazing.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"He encouraged me to get up and sing and actually my first song in the audition is the first one he made me get up and sing.\n\n\"It was one that people would put their pint glasses down in the pub to listen to me. And I think that was the moment I realised this was something a little bit different.\"\n\n*The X Factor: Celebrity airs Saturday on ITV", "description": "Jenny, also known as The Vixen on the ITV game show, is set to wow Celebrity X Factor viewers with her soaring vocals", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Dymond Thames Syco Rex", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20556264.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JENNY-RYAN-SPOTLIGHT-SOLO.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
