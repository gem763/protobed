Wolves destroyed us' before finishing the tweet off with a sad emoji.\n\nPep Guardiola and his Manchester City players cut frustrated figures in their loss to Wolves\n\nAdama Traore condemned City to their second league defeat of the season\n\nHowever, City's misery caused jubilation among both Wolves and Liverpool fans, who were celebrating a shock victory and maintaining an eight-point lead over City respectively.\n\nJournalist Tim Spiers hit out at those suggesting that involvement in the Europa League has dented Wolves' season, saying: 'You don't wanna qualify for the Europa League they said. Too many games they said. Thursday nights and Sundays they said. October 3: Besiktas 0 Wolves 1 October 6: Man City 0 Wolves 2'.\n\nMeanwhile Liverpool fan @hajjpharis was in jubilant mood as Jurgen Klopp's men retained their lead over the champions that they had established on Saturday by beating Leicester 2-1 thanks to a last-gasp James Milner penalty.\n\nHe tweeted: 'Man City 0-2 Wolves Retweet if you happy about this. It's 8 clear points'.\n\nHowever, some Reds fans preferred to urge caution despite their advantageous position at the top of the table.\n\nAmong those was @9JAKOPITES who wrote ' Me when I see Wolves beat Man city and we are now 8 points clear but there's 30 games left', before using a video of Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl celebrating a goal before realising it had been ruled out.\n\nMe when I see Wolves beat Man city and we are now 8 points clear but there's 30 games left \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23#MCIWOL pic.twitter.com/Zyc1xLGCyy \u2014 9jakopites Waleria (@9JAKOPITES) October 6, 2019\n\nRegardless however of how confident Liverpool fans are of winning a first league title since the 1989/90 season, Guardiola appears to have an early season headache on his hands, with his side just one point ahead of Arsenal and two ahead of Chelsea heading into the international break.\n\nCity lost just four league games last season as they won their second consecutive title.\n\nBut City have already recorded half that number of defeats after also losing to Norwich last month, with only eight games of the Premier League campaign gone.", "description": "Football supporters from all over the world believe Liverpool are already overwhelming favourites to win the title after Manchester City suffered a 2-0 defeat to Wolves.", "authors": ["Kishan Vaghela For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/21/19371238-0-image-a-5_1570394733815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
