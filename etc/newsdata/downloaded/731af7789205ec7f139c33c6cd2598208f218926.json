The court unanimously found that he misled the Queen, that his advice to suspend parliament was unlawful, and that parliament is therefore still in session.\n\nBut, curiously, the ruling has little effect on how Britain will or will not leave the EU. The prime minister was already in a worse position on Brexit than I think most people realised. This decision simply welds shut the metal box in which he is trapped. His only way out is to pass a deal through parliament by 19 October - the date in the law passed before prorogation to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nNow the desperation with which he will be trying to get any deal at all approved will be evident to all, making it all but impossible for him to succeed.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe ridiculous idea that Johnson could prorogue parliament again has been quashed emphatically by the court. Lady Hale said plainly that a normal prorogation before a Queen\u2019s Speech would be four to six days. So that means parliament has to sit now until a few days before such an event, if it goes ahead.\n\nJohnson was never as much in control of the timetable as he pretended. Now he has lost the only breathing space he had, of keeping MPs away from Westminster until 14 October.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

And the one thing we have known since the start of this year is that there is a majority in parliament against leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement.\n\nBut the court ruling makes it even harder to get a deal through parliament. Labour MPs sense that they have the prime minister on the run \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn made that clear with his impromptu response from the platform at the party conference in Brighton.\n\nIt will be harder now for Stephen Kinnock and his pro-deal colleagues among Labour MPs to vote for any deal that Johnson brings to parliament. They will be castigated by Remainers for bailing the prime minister out of his sinking premiership. That means we are likely to be heading for the biggest decision of Johnson\u2019s short time as prime minister: on 19 October will he send the letter required by law asking the EU for an extension (which it is almost certain to grant), or will he resign?
