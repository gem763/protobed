He was jailed last week for up to 13 years alongside eight others over a failed bid for independence in 2017.\n\nThe 44-year-old said that he remained in favour of Catalan independence and would support another referendum on it, but spoke out against some of the violence that has been seen at pro-separatist protests in Barcelona.\n\nCatalan language\n\nOmnium Cultural, which Cuixart chairs, was founded in 1961 to defend Catalan culture under the Franco dictatorship when public use of the Catalan language was banned.\n\nIn Spain, all but one of the main political parties have consistently opposed an independence referendum for Catalonia, but separatist parties are not banned and the region already enjoys a degree of political autonomy and control over part of its budget.\n\nAbout 2.3 million people turned out for the referendum - around 43% of eligible voters - with 90% voting to break away from Spain, according to the Catalan government, as many opposed to independence boycotted the ballot.", "description": "Catalan leader Quim Torra will meet regional mayors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/01/68/1000x563_cmsv2_8201f221-2171-5b8f-a033-4801b4806008-4260168.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
