A three-person crew \u2014 made up of NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan, Russian cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov, and Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency \u2014 are heading to space on top of a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan.\n\nThe trio will be joining the three current members of the International Space Station \u2014 NASA astronauts Nick Hague and Christina Koch, as well as Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin. All three have been aboard since March, when they launched to the ISS. For Hague and Ovchinin, that trip was actually their second launch to the station, after their first flight ended in an emergency landing. For Koch, it\u2019s her fist stay on the ISS and it\u2019s going to be a significant one. She\u2019ll be staying on the station until February of 2020 which sets her up to break the record for longest continuous spaceflight by a woman.\n\nAmong the new crew, Morgan is also slated for an extended stay. His fellow crew members will be coming back in February along with Koch, but Morgan will be coming back in the spring of 2020, making his trip nearly a year long. Most astronauts stay just six months on the ISS.\n\nAmong the new crew, Morgan is slated for an extended stay\n\nNASA has been lengthening the trips for some of its ISS crews as the agency prepares to start flying people on new vehicles over the next year. Since 2011, NASA has relied on the Russian Soyuz to transport people to and from the ISS, but soon two commercial companies, SpaceX and Boeing, will start flying NASA astronauts to the station. Those vehicles aren\u2019t ready to fly people yet though, and it\u2019s possible they won\u2019t be ready until early next year. Meanwhile, NASA has only a few seats left on future flights of Russia\u2019s Soyuz vehicle, which means the agency will be without a ride very soon. Until SpaceX and Boeing are up and running, NASA is keeping its astronauts on the ISS a little longer than normal to ensure that the station continues to have US astronauts aboard.\n\nMorgan and his crew mates are scheduled to take off at 12:28PM ET from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. They\u2019ll meet up with the ISS just six hours after launch and dock around 6:50PM ET. About two hours after that, the spacecraft\u2019s hatches will open and the crew will be greeted by their new roommates.\n\nNASA\u2019s coverage of the launch will begin at 11:30AM ET, and the show will immediately be followed by remarks from Vice President Mike Pence, who is scheduled to give a speech about the Apollo 11 anniversary at 1PM ET from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Check back tomorrow to watch humans fly to space, 50 years after people first set foot on the Moon.", "description": "On July 20th, the next round of astronauts are headed to the International Space Station, the same day as the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.
