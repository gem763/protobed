The Prime Minister signed off some \u00a3126,000 to the former model and businesswoman during his tenure as Mayor of London\n\nIt came as Miss Arcuri gave an exclusive interview to the Mail in which she referred to herself as \u2018Boris\u2019s Anne Boleyn\u2019, describing how the second wife of Henry VIII had refused to \u2018give him her virtue\u2019.\n\nHowever she would not comment on whether she had an affair with Mr Johnson.\n\nThe GLA committee wrote to Mr Johnson over claims that as London mayor he \u2018failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in relation to the awarding of public funds\u2019 to Miss Arcuri.\n\nAnd the body requested \u2018details and a timeline of all contact with Jennifer Arcuri during your period of office as Mayor of London, including personal, social and professional\u2019.\n\n'I was Boris\u2019s Anne Boleyn,' says Arcuri (pictured) in her first print interview since the scandal broke. You were? 'I sure was,' she insists\n\nMs Arcuri reportedly met Mr Johnson, some 21 years her senior, when she volunteered on his re-election campaign in 2013 and in turn, he supported her business venture, according to a source\n\nMr Johnson this week responded by sending material to the committee \u2013 but marked it \u2018private and confidential\u2019 and \u2018Not for publication\u2019. Mr Duvall of the GLA committee has already written to him demanding to know why he marked the information as secret.\n\nMr Johnson has consistently denied any impropriety \u2013 but has singularly failed to deny having an affair with Miss Arcuri.\n\nMiss Arcuri also says that any grants given to her firm were \u2018above board\u2019.\n\nThe letter from Mr Johnson\u2019s lawyers, sent this week and leaked to the Huffington Post yesterday, said their client \u2018intends to fully cooperate with the Director General of the Independent Office for Police Conduct in its separate inquiry into the PM\u2019s links to Arcuri.\u2019", "description": "The Prime Minister's law firm Atkins Thomson has written a letter to the chairman of the Greater London Authority oversight committee Len Duvall after the body requested 'extensive' details.", "authors": ["Neil Sears For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/01/18955182-0-image-a-83_1570839211648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
