But I\u2019m happy to sit down and talk with you if you\u2019d like,\u201d Mr. Yang tweeted to the comedian.\n\n\u201cFor the record, I do not think he should lose his job. We would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human,\u201d Mr. Yang added.\n\nMr. Gillis has faced backlash since his addition to SNL\u2019s cast was announced this week after recordings surfaced of him making derogatory remarks about Asians \u2014 including Mr. Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants \u2014 as well as various offensive comments about women, Muslims, members of the LGBT community. He has since apologized amid calls for his firing.\n\nIn a podcast released in May, Mr. Gillis referred to Mr. Yang as a \u201cJew ch\u2014k,\u201d according to The Hollywood Reporter. He used similar language in other episodes currently available online.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss. If you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you\u2019re going to find a lot of bad misses,\u201d Mr. Gillis tweeted Thursday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said. My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Gillis among three new SNL cast members named this week ahead of the show\u2019s 45th seasons starting on NBC this fall. The others include Chloe Fineman and Bowen Yang, the latter being the show\u2019s first Chinese-American cast member.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
