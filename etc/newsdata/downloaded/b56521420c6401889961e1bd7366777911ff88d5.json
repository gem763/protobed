The image appeared in a patent application filed by Sony with the World Intellectual Property Office.\n\nAn image of what could be the PlayStation 5 development kit taken from a Sony patent. Sony via LetsGoDigital\n\nThe design is credited to Sony technical director Yasuhiro Ootori. Ootori was involved in the launch of the PlayStation 4 back in 2013, going so far as to take the console apart piece by piece in an interview with Wired.\n\nAt least one person in the video game industry confirmed that this is a development kit for the PlayStation 5. Matthew Stott, an artist for Codemasters, tweeted that his office had a dev kit matching the patent. Stott later deleted the tweet, then his entire Twitter account, which may have violated a non-disclosure agreement with Sony.\n\nIn an October interview with Sony, Wired Magazine noted that the PlayStation 5 development kit Sony showed them looked similar to the patent images, but Sony declined to talk about how the dev kit could influence the final design of the PlayStation 5.\n\nIt should be noted that development kits for new consoles rarely look the same as the finished product, but it's still interesting to know that Sony's new hardware is already in the hands of developers.\n\nRead more: The 8 most important details we already know about PlayStation 5, Sony's next-generation video game console\n\nSony has teased some of the features coming to the PlayStation 5, including a solid-state hard drive for faster loading times, ray tracing graphics with 8K resolution, and backwards compatibility with PlayStation 4 games. Microsoft promised similar features for its Xbox successor, Project Scarlett, at E3 in June. Scarlett has been confirmed for a November 2020 release, while Sony has not been specific about the PlayStation 5's launch date.\n\nCheck out the design from other angles below:", "description": "A patent document filed by Sony might have given us our first look at the next PlayStation console more than a year before it's expected to launch.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c8ac055824d459f7923b1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
