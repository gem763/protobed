As Trump repeatedly blasted unproven allegations of wrongdoing against the Bidens, Biden wasn\u2019t aggressive enough for Democrats who want the fight taken to the president.\n\nBut in speeches at two events here on Wednesday, Biden attacked the president in the sharpest and most personal terms he\u2019s used since entering the Democratic primary. For the first time, he directly called for Trump\u2019s impeachment. He accused the president of spreading lies and of attempting to extort another country. He even pivoted to ripping on Trump\u2019s lawyer, Giuliani, mocking him as a man of great \u201cintegrity.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/583/1155968404_6093507521001_6093506906001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nIt was his most aggressive posture to date, presenting a case that Trump could not be trusted, while positioning himself as the fighter that America needs at this moment to face off against a \u201cbully\u201d and a \u201ccoward.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November,\u201d Biden told New Hampshire crowds. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let him get away with this. He\u2019s picked a fight with the wrong guy.\u201d\n\nBiden didn\u2019t even stop with Trump: He also took a veiled shot at Elizabeth Warren, who has overtaken Biden in recent national polls and whose campaign mantra is centered on her dozens of policy plans.\n\n\u201cIt takes a proven ability to get things done,\u201d Biden said in Manchester. \u201cWe\u2019re not electing a planner.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s shift toward a harsher tone and his evolution on impeachment was born out of circumstance, necessity and personal animus. It came after days of privately huddling with advisers. The steady stream of new revelations and incendiary statements from Trump made it almost impossible for Biden not to take a more fiery stance.\n\nAside from the daily drumbeat of news about Trump\u2019s conduct, Biden also fielded incoming complaints from donors and supporters who wanted to see more aggression out of Biden against the president.\n\n\u201cI believe he\u2019s heard from a lot of people, because I have, that it would be good for him to be stronger against Trump,\u201d said Sheila Nix, who\u2019s on Biden\u2019s national finance council. \u201cIt would be beneficial for him to take charge and define himself and not let Trump define him.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s attacks over the past two weeks haven\u2019t shown much of a dent in the Democrat\u2019s poll numbers, there has been no tangible sign of a rallying effect either.\n\nAnd there were signs he was slipping. For the first time, with another nationwide survey showing Warren in first place, the Real Clear Politics polling average Tuesday showed her marginally ahead of Biden. Something had to change.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to get ahead of the House and we don\u2019t want to be dragged into the president\u2019s world of lies and false equivalencies where this just looked like two campaigns battling back and forth,\u201d said a Biden adviser, who was not authorized to speak on behalf of the candidate.\n\nOne problem complicating Biden\u2019s response to Trump was the issue of his son, Hunter Biden. Prior to entering the race, Biden fretted to friends that \u201cthey\u2019re going to go after my boy.\u201d And after Trump did just that, Biden felt the need to release some of his pent-up loathing against Trump, an adviser to the campaign told POLITICO.\n\nBut he was hamstrung by the fact that the business arrangements his son had struck when he was vice president just looked bad.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to throw your son under the bus,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cThe fact is, there\u2019s only so much Joe could do.\u201d\n\nBiden has so far opted to avoid attacking Trump\u2019s children \u2014 who have their own conflict of interest issues \u2014 in part because it offends his moderate sensibilities \u201cbut it\u2019s not off the table. We can fight fire with fire,\u201d the adviser told POLITICO.\n\nAnother Biden adviser said the sharpened focus was unavoidable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the sheer number of things that have happened in the last 15 days: the contents of the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, the whistleblower complaint being made public showing how the president\u2019s advisers tried to cover it up, calling for China to be improperly involved,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cFinally, in the last 24 hours, it was Trump saying he wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Biden said at a Wednesday event that he hadn\u2019t planned on making such a major speech in New Hampshire but felt moved by the day\u2019s events, in a reference to Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of Syria.\n\n\u201cEveryone has their breaking point,\u201d said Terry Shumaker, a former Bill Clinton co-chair in New Hampshire and Biden surrogate who watched Biden\u2019s remarks. \u201cI\u2019ve known Joe for 30 years. I don\u2019t think the speech today was the result of some politically-driven decision.\u201d\n\nStill, just hours after Biden\u2019s call for impeachment, Biden\u2019s campaign was fundraising off of it.\n\n\u201cJoe called for Trump to be impeached,\u201d a fundraising email said. \u201cTrump was FURIOUS.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign noticed the change in direction immediately \u2014 Trump himself began tweeting about Biden before his first speech Wednesday was even over. The campaign later slammed Biden\u2019s new stance on impeachment.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden opposed impeachment 4 months ago, saying it's \u2018a gigantic distraction\u2018 from things \u2018we should be focusing on getting done,\u2019\u201d the Trump campaign\u2019s War Room account tweeted. \u201cWhat's changed? He's no longer front-runner, & he's desperate to dodge questions about foreign entities giving money to his son while he was VP!\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/21/f4/3a4f023543c8a59cbb1e1f65d9a8/191010-joe-biden-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
