Extra virgin olive oil: It's the base ingredient to so many dishes, especially Italian and Mediterranean cuisine. This type of oil is a traditional fat and a dietary staple with so many health benefits! 2. Fresh herbs: Fresh herbs make all the difference when creating delicious meals, enhancing the flavour and adding flavour-inducive aromas. Basil, in particular, is always a kitchen hero of mine! 3. Garlic and onions: Every kitchen needs these basic ingredients and while some people may be put off by the strong smell, you shouldn't be afraid to use them! Dishes are enhanced with flavour and can be transformed with these staples. 4. Tomatoes: Fresh tomatoes can be used in so many ways, both raw and cooked. From having it simply in a salad to making sauces and using it as a base in so many dishes, there are countless ways you can use a tomato to create an enjoyable meal. 5. Flour: Flour is a pantry essential and is amazing to have so you can make your own bread, pizza dough, pasta and not to mention, an array of sweet treats! Experiment with different flours so you can find out what you prefer - after all, there's so many to choose from these days!\n\n1. Buying processed foods\n\nThe executive chef of Barangaroo's fine dining restaurant Corso Brio said one of the biggest mistakes was buying processed foods.\n\n'For tasty dishes and the best results, I always recommend starting from scratch - selecting fresh, local ingredients is always the way to go,' Davide told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'Your dishes are guaranteed to taste better and it's that much more satisfying when you've created a meal that is made from the best, real ingredients that don't have any artificial flavours.'\n\n2. Using dried instead of fresh herbs\n\nIf you want to enhance the flavours in the dish, Davide said always use fresh herbs instead of dried ones.\n\n'There's simply nothing better than the beautiful aroma of freshly chopped herbs. Using fresh herbs not only enhances the flavour but is also key to helping you understand better which herb complements other ingredients,' he said.\n\n'Take the time to smell and taste the herbs to appreciate the flavour and experiment with it to find out what you like and how it can be added to home-cooked meals. Fresh herbs can truly take any home-cooked meal to the next level.'\n\n3. Not adding salt to boiling water when cooking pasta\n\nMost foodies already know that adding salt to boiling water will enhance the flavour of pasta noodles - yet many home cooks still skip this step.\n\n'When cooking pasta, it is essential to add salt to the pot as soon as the water starts boiling. Allowing the salt to completely dissolve in the boiling water before adding in your pasta will leave you with an enhanced flavour in the pasta,' Davide said.\n\n'Adding salt also helps to cook your pasta more thoroughly so don't forget to add in the salt if you want a more flavoursome pasta dish.'\n\nThe executive chef of Barangaroo's fine dining restaurant Corso Brio said one of the biggest mistakes was buying processed foods instead of using fresh ingredients\n\n4. Following recipes using cups, teaspoons or tablespoons\n\nDavide said another cooking error was following recipes by using cups, teaspoons or tablespoons instead of metric measurements.\n\n'I find that home-cooked meals always turn out better when the recipe asks for measurements in grams, kilograms, litres and so on,' Davide said.\n\n'When it comes to experimenting with new recipes, you want to be as precise as possible, especially with dessert recipes. Sometimes, all it takes is a little too much of an ingredient to put the dish off balance.\n\n'A kitchen scale can be your best friend when you're trying out new recipes. Knowing why a specific measurement is needed in a recipe helps you to understand taste levels, and from there, you can adjust it to how you like it.'\n\nWith many time poor people turning to fast meal options, Davide said home cooks should always take the time to appreciate the food they're cooking with\n\n5. Cooking too fast\n\nWith many time poor people turning to fast meal options, Davide said home cooks should always take the time to appreciate the food they're cooking with.\n\n'These days, most of us don't have the time to cook and when we do, it's usually late, we're starving and all we want is to get food in our stomach as quickly as possible,' he said.\n\n'Food is such a wonderful part of life that if we can, we should take the time to really appreciate the food we cook. Remember: cooking is an art form combined with science.\n\n'Rushing when cooking can sometimes mean you \"cut corners\" and that can often lead to overcooked or burnt food, tasteless food you don't enjoy or simply food that might not be making you feel that great afterwards.\n\n'So when you can, start from scratch, use fresh ingredients you love and with a little bit of creativity, you can whip up an incredible dish you'll love and want more of.'", "description": "Sydney's top Italian chef Davide Incardona has revealed the common cooking mistakes home cooks make - and the six ingredients every household should own.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/06/19677858-0-image-a-57_1571029693364.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
