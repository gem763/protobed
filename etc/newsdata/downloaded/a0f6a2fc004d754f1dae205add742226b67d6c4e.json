Virtual reality is a computer-generated simulation of an environment or situation It immerses the user by making them feel like they are in the simulated reality throughimages and sounds For example, in VR, you could feel like you're climbing a mountain while sat at home In contrast, augmented reality layers computer-generated images on top of an existing reality AR is developed into apps to bring digital components into the real world\n\nFor example, in the Pokemon Go app, the characters seem to appear in real world scenarios\n\nThis past week Bloomberg reported that Apple's upcoming augmented reality headset - which are being referred to as 'glasses' - will sync with one's iPhone to display maps, messages, games and email.\n\nThe company is also reportedly considering making its app store accessible through hardware.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the glasses will also come with holographic lenses that will likely serve as the technical backbone of the device and bring its AR experience to life by overlaying digital displays on real life.\n\nLikewise Facebook has reportedly partnered with Rayban to work on its own pair of augmented reality glasses in the coming one to two years.\n\nBloomberg suggests that unlike Apple's headset, however, Facebook will not have augmented reality built-in, but will function similarly to Snapchat's Spetacles and work to place calls, take pictures, and more.", "description": "Unlike most patent filings, the headset is shown in both diagrams and a full-on 3D rendering that gives an uncharacteristic glimpse of what the device may actually look like if it were to be made.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20042760-0-image-a-10_1571759288158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
