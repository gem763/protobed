The Census Bureau does not designate what portion of noncitizens are in the country illegally, but Mr. Frey said it was possible that some of the decline was among those people. In all, noncitizens declined by about 478,000 people; more than half were people from Latin America.\n\nFor many years, Mexico was the largest contributor of immigrants. But since 2010, the number of immigrants arriving from Mexico has declined, while the number coming from China and India have surged. But in 2018, the number of people from Asia who lived in the United States but were not American citizens declined. Mr. Bier said that could reflect people working or studying in the United States who had giving up on waiting for immigration status.\n\n\u201cThe difference is so large that it\u2019s more likely that people who are waiting or hoping for legal permanent residence felt that the arrival of the Trump administration was the writing on the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThat goes for people in all sorts of statuses.\u201d\n\nAnother decline appears to be happening among students from China. The Associated Press reported this week that American universities are reporting steep declines in Chinese students, which is cutting into tuition revenue. Several universities have reported drops of one-fifth or more this fall, according to the report, which quoted university administrators blaming rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nMr. Frey also spotted political patterns. Of the 14 states with the lowest concentrations of foreign-born people, 12 voted for Mr. Trump. In half of those 12 states, Asians dominated recent immigrant gains. In 10 of those states, immigrants are more likely than native-born residents to hold bachelor\u2019s degrees, Mr. Frey found.\n\nTwo states \u2014 New York and Illinois \u2014 had measurable declines in their foreign-born populations, while 11 had increases, including Florida, Texas and Arizona.", "description": "The U.S. population gained immigrants last year at the slowest pace since 2008.
