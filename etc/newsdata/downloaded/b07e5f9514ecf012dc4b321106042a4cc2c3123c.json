Bush: Texas State Land Commissioner May Be Eyeing Higher Office", "language": "en", "text": "Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush speaks prior to Jeb Bush formally announcing his campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination in Miami, Fla., June 15, 2015. REUTERS/ (Joe Skipper/Reuters)\n\nA source in Texas told me that George P. Bush, currently the state\u2019s land commissioner, already is running a quiet campaign for lieutenant governor. His people would not exactly confirm that, but what they did say was, in a sense, more interesting: Who says it\u2019s lieutenant governor?\n\n\u201cWhile he wouldn\u2019t challenge current Governor Abbott or Lieutenant Governor Patrick, if an opening presents itself he would absolutely consider serving Texans in a higher role. When that moment arises, he\u2019s ready,\u201d said adviser J. R. Hernandez.\n\nGeorge P. Bush is the son of the former Florida governor and the nephew of the former Texas governor and president. He was born in Houston and is a graduate of Rice University and the University of Texas School of Law.\n\n\u201cOver the last few months,\u201d Hernandez says, \u201cseveral activists and donors have asked Commissioner Bush to consider higher office in Texas. At this time he is 100 percent focused on doing his job as land commissioner.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has repeatedly denied rumors that he is joining the Trump administration. Lately, he has been crossways with the National Rifle Association over expanding background checks. Presumably, he\u2019s 100 percent focused on doing his job as lieutenant governor.", "description": "A source in Texas told me that George P.
