We\u2019re advocating for equality and that includes ordination.\u201d\n\nThe church has been struggling with a shortage of priests for decades, particularly in Europe and North America, which have had sharp falls in church membership as well as devastating sexual abuse scandals. In some places, priests have been moved from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where the church is flourishing, to fill vacancies.\n\n\u200cWhile Pope Francis has opened up more discussion about women\u2019s roles and appointed women in key Vatican positions, the topic of them becoming priests is still very much taboo. A huge number of women serve within the church around the world, outnumbering men in some countries, but they are denied the privilege of voting at Vatican synods, such as the one on the Amazon currently taking place, because they are not ordained.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of this massive injustice are far-reaching beyond the church,\u201d said Miriam Duignan, from Wow\u2019s unit in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of who stands at the altar each Sunday and blesses the bread \u2026 women are silenced and sidelined, and this has a tidal effect beyond the priesthood in terms of how women are seen.\u201d\n\nThe campaigners, who held umbrellas to shield themselves from the afternoon sun, said they were often insulted during protests, with one Rome police officer telling them to move away and close their umbrellas because they featured a \u201cwomen priests\u201d slogan.\n\nTheir biggest fear over the idea of allowing married men in the Amazon to be ordained is that the many women who already carry out ministerial roles in the region could be supplanted by men.\n\n\u201cThe church would not be alive in the Amazon if it wasn\u2019t for women,\u201d said Duignan. \u201cThey are undertaking priestly roles without having the title of priest.\u201d\n\nPat Brown, also from the UK, said the situation for women serving the church in the developing world is more acute. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad for us but they suffer this misogyny: the church endorses sexism.\u201d\n\nThe Amazon synod, which wraps up on 27 October, has discussed the role of women in the region, with Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes, the president of the synod, proposing that \u201ca suitable ministry\u201d be established for \u201cwomen community leaders\u201d. Many bishops have supported the ordination of married men despite criticism from more conservative factions.\n\nThe pope has previously said he would be open to allowing married men to be ordained in areas where there was a scarcity of priests, while maintaining the requirement for most priests to be celibate. He has also spoken about \u201callowing space for women in the church at all levels\u201d.\n\nAs the event draws to a close, the Vatican on Tuesday lambasted the two extreme conservative Catholics who stole Amazonian statues from a church near the Vatican and dumped them in the Tiber River.\n\nThe wooden statues, which depict a pregnant woman and represent an indigenous Virgin Mary, were presented to the pope at the start of the synod but critics consider them to be pagan. Paolo Ruffini, the Vatican\u2019s head of communications, said the theft was \u201ca stupid stunt\u201d.\n\nThe four statues were stolen from the Santa Maria in Traspontina church on Monday and the stunt filmed by the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cIn the name of tradition and doctrine, an effigy of maternity and the sacredness of life was dumped in contempt,\u201d said Ruffini, adding that the \u201cviolent and intolerant gesture\u201d had \u201cpassed from hate on social media to action\u201d.", "description": "Campaigners gather outside Vatican as church struggles with shortage of priests", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida", "Joanna Moorhead", "Peter Stanford"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d1b523379dd79b4f939eb20dbfeb7778893df5/0_139_4170_2502/master/4170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1fc9f05a29081f017b95a23447660219", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
