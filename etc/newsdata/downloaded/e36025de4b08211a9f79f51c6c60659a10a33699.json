Rand Paul outside his Kentucky home, ordering a resentencing for the attack that broke the lawmaker\u2019s ribs.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it found \u201cno compelling justification\u201d for Rene Boucher\u2019s 30-day sentence.\n\nThe ruling came in response to an appeal by federal prosecutors who had argued that 21 months would have been more appropriate. The appeals court took no position on an appropriate sentence, saying the federal district court judge retains \u201cample discretion.\u201d\n\nThe Republican senator was tackled by Boucher in late 2017 when Paul\u2019s then-neighbor became angry over lawn maintenance at the senator\u2019s home.\n\nThe attack broke several of Paul\u2019s ribs, damaged a lung and led to bouts of pneumonia. Part of his damaged lung was removed in a recent surgery. Earlier this year, Paul had hernia surgery in another procedure connected to the assault.\n\nBoucher pleaded guilty to assaulting a member of Congress and served his 30-day sentence at a federal prison in Illinois.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the trial judge got it right the first time,\u201d Boucher\u2019s attorney, Matt Baker, said by phone Monday. \u201cAnd now it looks like we\u2019re going to be back at square one with regard to sentencing. It\u2019s just very disappointing to have gone through this entire process and to have come full circle.\u201d\n\nBaker said he\u2019s considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nPaul\u2019s office did not immediately comment on Monday\u2019s ruling. Prosecutors involved in the appeal did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nPaul sued Boucher, and a jury in Bowling Green, Kentucky, awarded the lawmaker and former presidential candidate more than $580,000 in damages and medical expenses. Boucher has since sold his home next door to the senator.\n\nIn sentencing Boucher, U.S. District Judge Marianne Battani said she surmised the attack to be a \u201cdispute between neighbors\u201d and an \u201cisolated incident,\u201d not motivated by politics. On Monday, the appeals court panel said the sentencing judge \u201cgave little weight to the need to promote general deterrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccepting that Boucher\u2019s attack did not appear to be politically motivated, Paul\u2019s status as a national political figure is still relevant to the broader \u2018goals of societal deterrence\u2019 served by Boucher\u2019s sentence,\u201d Judge Jane B. Stranch wrote in the appeals court opinion.\n\nThe sentencing judge also noted Boucher\u2019s background, including his education, medical practice, community reputation, church involvement, status as a military veteran and lack of criminal history. Stranch said those factors are \u201calmost all disfavored as grounds for a below-guidelines sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo prioritize a defendant\u2019s education, professional success and standing in the community would give an additional leg up to defendants who are already in a privileged position,\u201d Stranch wrote. \u201cIndigent defendants are less likely to impress a sentencing court with their education, employment record or local reputation. But they are no less deserving of a reasonable and compassionate sentence.\u201d\n\nPaul testified during his civil trial that he feared for his life as he struggled to breathe after Boucher, an anesthesiologist, slammed into him in their upscale Bowling Green neighborhood.\n\nPaul testified that he got off his riding mower to pick up a stick and was straightening up when Boucher hit him from behind. Paul said he was wearing noise-canceling headphones and didn\u2019t hear Boucher coming toward him.\n\nDuring his testimony, Boucher acknowledged he wasn\u2019t thinking rationally and called it \u201ctwo minutes of my life I wish I could take back.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Dylan Lovan in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it found \"no compelling justification\" for Rene Boucher's 30-day sentence.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bruce Schreiner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/03/21/rand_paul_assaulted_60925_c0-78-2658-1627_s1770x1032.jpg?6f4317f37dbd5df2c1133e275fa6262c15e28b45", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
