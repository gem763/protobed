As a dress designer for Broadway shows by trade, Hinz was up to the demanding design challenge, but even she admits that there were parts that threw her for a loop (or perhaps a roll).\n\n\u201cHow am I going to make this dress tie?\u201d Hinz said. \u201cOne of the most difficult parts is how do you fasten the dress together because you can\u2019t use snaps or zippers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I was taking thread and braiding it together in order to create ties to lace it,\u201d she added. \u201cThat was one of my [hacks].\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHinz, a self-proclaimed \u201cmovie buff,\u201d based her 2019 design on Katniss Everdeen\u2019s wedding dress from the \"Hunger Games\u201d film series \u2014 though to achieve the volume the seamstress wanted, she had to get inventive.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to go all out, I\u2019m going to make it myself,\u201d Hinz said, noting that she felt using an already-made hoop skirt would be \u201ccheating,\u201d despite the competition allowing one to do so.\n\n\u201cI made a hoop skirt out of toilet paper, tape and glue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was definitely the most difficult part of my dress, which, you don\u2019t even see in the end. But it created the silhouette that I wanted.\u201d\n\nHinz, who was one of the 12 finalists chosen from thousands of entries in each of the two years she has entered the competition, noted that she likes a challenge and appreciated the community of people she has met.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a real family,\u201d Davis shared.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"What a bizarre club to be in,\" she added, joking.\n\n\u201cWe do keep in contact with each other. It is a lot of fun,\u201d Hinz confirmed. \"We\u2019re not out to get each other. We\u2019re all rooting for each other.\"\n\nWhile it's an involved process -- Davis and Hinz said it can take up to a year designing and creating the dress -- the women explained that the tight-knit community shares hacks.\n\n\u201cYou can really think outside the box in terms of what constitutes as tape and glue,\u201d Hinz said. (The rules state contestants can only use thread, tape, glue and toilet paper to create the looks.)\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER ASKS INSTAGRAM FANS TO CHOOSE HIS WEDDING TUXEDO\n\n\u201cOne year there was a contestant who used plaster wall tape, and it\u2019s sheer, and that\u2019s what she used to make a veil,\u201d said Hinz. Davis added that another contestant had used glitter tape to give a shimmery feel to the gown.\n\nOne hack that Davis, who described the entire experience as \u201cinspiring\u201d and \u201cgobsmacking,\u201d particularly enjoyed was a contestant\u2019s innovative use of color.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite hacks was seeing color on the dress, and I asked the contestant, Frank, \u2018How did you get that color?\u2019 Because, first of all, you\u2019re not allowed to dye [the toilet paper], but you can\u2019t dye it, it would disintegrate.\u201d\n\nSo how did the inventive designer create the look? With the helpful use of Ebay, Davis shared.\n\n\u201cThat was vintage toilet paper,\u201d the contestant told Davis.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nHowever, don\u2019t expect Davis to be stocking up on colored toilet paper if it ever makes a return to shelves.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, all that dye on your hoo-ha really freaks me out,\u201d Davis said, laughing. \u201cBut maybe just for the competition.\u201d\n\nCatch all of the impressive designs on TLC\u2019s premiere special Monday at 10 p.m. EST.", "description": "Hopefully this doesn\u2019t count as the bride\u2019s \u201csomething old.\u201d", "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/30/694940094001_6090754494001_6090759248001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
