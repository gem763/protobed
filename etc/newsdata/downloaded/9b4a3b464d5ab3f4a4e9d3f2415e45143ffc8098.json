But it has a complicated stigma attached to it; everybody is doing it, but not everybody talks about it.\n\nAs children, some of us were told that masturbation causes blindness, and we still have a way to go before masturbation is seen as a healthy, normal part of women\u2019s sexuality.\n\nDon't forget to take our sex survey \u2013 you could stand the chance of winning R5 000 in cash!\n\nRead more: 10 women share their favourite masturbation techniques\n\nFor every proud proclaimer of solitary sex there\u2019s another who offers a disclaimer like, \u201cI was desperate, bored or too tired for intercourse.\u201d We need to stop thinking of masturbation as an excuse and see it for what it is. Here, the facts, excerpted from Getting Off by Jamye Waxman.\n\n1. It\u2019s more acceptable for men\n\nOur vulvas are not perceived as the veritable joystick his penis is, and so we look down at our genitals as if they were second-class citizens. We\u2019re taught that our vaginas are for making babies and not for sexual pleasure, and nobody teaches us about our clitoris, therefore we believe we\u2019re designed to be less sexual than men are.\n\nRead more: \u201cMy wife asked to watch me masturbate so she could learn what I like\u201d\n\nBut the truth is, we\u2019re not. Yes, we\u2019re different \u2013 we have monthly cycles and our bodies can more easily align with the moon \u2013 but that only goes to prove our bodies are sacred temples and we need to worship them as such.\n\n2. It\u2019s a poor substitute for being coupled-up\n\nSociety perpetuates the idea that we aren\u2019t complete unless one plus one equals two; that we are supposed to sacrifice our individuality when we enter into a relationship. But as we grow up, we come to understand that happiness does not come from somebody else; we are responsible for meeting our needs and fulfilling our desires.\n\nRead more: 6 mind-blowing ways to stimulate your clit\n\nAt the same time, more and more women have abandoned antiquated gender stereotypes. We\u2019re finding ways to support ourselves financially, emotionally and sexually. We\u2019re searching for orgasms with and without partners, and we don\u2019t expect our partners to teach us everything we need to know about our sexuality.\n\n3. It\u2019s not cool to masturbate if you\u2019re in a relationship\n\nYes, masturbation is solo sex, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be alone to do it. Single people masturbate, obviously, but statistics show that women in relationships masturbate more often than their single counterparts, especially women with healthy sex lives.\n\nRead more: \u201cI tried the Hot Octopuss Queen Bee clitoral stimulator \u2013 and now it\u2019s my new favourite toy\u201d\n\nThe time you spend alone with yourself is very different from the time you spend focusing on both of you. And it\u2019s time well spent \u2013 learning things about your body that your partner may not be able to discover without your help.\n\nRead more: Butt plugs: A beginner\u2019s guide\n\nA 2007 Australian study showed that 55% of single women orgasm every time they masturbate, while only 25% of women orgasm with a partner. So why deny yourself more orgasms? Besides, women who masturbate are aroused more often than women who don\u2019t. Unless you\u2019re using masturbation as a crutch and a way to avoid sex with your partner, it\u2019s totally cool to get it on alone.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Everybody is doing it, but not everybody talks about it.", "authors": ["Jamye Waxman"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7767/33956e73532a4502a607d6afffb014fd.png", "published_at": "2018-08-11"}
