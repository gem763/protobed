Ilhan Omar (D-MN) danced at an event last week on the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, a claim that\u2019s based on footage that wasn\u2019t actually taken from that day.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet circulated a video from conservative personality Terrence Williams, in which Williams declared that Omar \u201cpartied on the anniversary of 9/11.\u201d In his video, Williams comments on footage of the Muslim congresswoman dancing and fumes that she\u2019s disrespecting the memory of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nBut the footage of Omar dancing actually came from a Sept. 13 event hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus and wasn\u2019t taken on the 11th, as Williams and Trump wrongly claimed.\n\nTrump, however, used Williams\u2019 video to declare that Omar would help Republicans win Minnesota. \u201cIlhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cThe new face of the Democrat Party!\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 original tweet was deleted from Twitter at some point on Wednesday. Twitter confirmed to The Daily Beast that the video post was not removed by the social media site\u2019s administrators but was instead deleted by Williams or someone with access to his Twitter account.\n\nWilliams did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOmar blasted Trump\u2019s smear on Wednesday, tweeting that he has put her life in danger.\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation?\u201d\n\nTrump has frequently targeted Omar with smears, inspiring death threats against the Somali-American lawmaker. In July, Trump suggested that Omar had married her own brother to commit immigration fraud\u2014a baseless claim that\u2019s become increasingly popular on the right, despite being based entirely on a single, anonymous message-board post.", "description": "The false tweet Trump boosted to claim Omar danced on 9/11\u2019s anniversary has disappeared from the site, but Twitter says they didn\u2019t delete it.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3332,w_5924,x_0,y_616/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568825611/RTX7393O_bgykfw", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
