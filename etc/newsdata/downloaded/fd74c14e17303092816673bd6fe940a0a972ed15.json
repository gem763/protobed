The NHS trust then told Mr Evans pages had been omitted due to \"an administrative error during scanning\".\n\nMr Evans, who runs the Factor 8 group, said: \"The fact that there could be this idea to keep known hepatitis-infected Factor VIII in circulation, as early as 1974, will be deeply upsetting to victims and families.\n\n\"It would be unthinkable today to keep any medication known to be infected with a potentially lethal virus on the shelves.\n\n\"Common sense would beg the question why did it seem like an option even back then?\n\n\"How is that no one thought to put a stop to all this the moment that it became apparent infected material was in circulation?\n\n\"Factor VIII was sold as a drug of convenience, that could be used from home.\n\n\n\n\"Of course that's not what it turned out to be at all - it was in fact the drug of death for thousands.\"\n\nMr Evans's solicitor Des Collins, senior partner at Collins Solicitors, which is representing more than 1,000 victims, their families and seven campaign groups, said: \"It can never be acceptable to knowingly give contaminated blood products to anyone.\n\n\"What is also patently clear is that nothing changed as a result of this meeting: even though the risks were well known, the blood products continued to be given to anyone who had been prescribed them, regardless of their hepatitis status, for another decade or so.\n\n\"This was a time when precautionary principles should have been taken. It was not a time for reckless ideas and chancing.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesman said: \"The infected blood scandal was a tragedy that should never have happened, and the ongoing public inquiry was set up to get to the truth and give families the answers they deserve.\n\n\"We are committed to being open and transparent with the inquiry and have waived the usual legal privileges to assist the process.\"\n\nIn September 2018, the inquiry heard emotional testimonies from people infected with HIV and hepatitis.\n\nEleanor Gray QC, acting for the DHSC, told it that the treatment of information surrounding contaminated blood products has been \"at worst, a cover-up, at best a lack of candour about past events\".\n\nFormer health secretary Lord Owen has said there was a \"cover-up\" and \"incriminating evidence\" had been suppressed by the Government to prevent victims taking legal action.", "description": "Senior medics knew haemophiliacs were being given imported blood products that were making them sick with hepatitis", "authors": ["Andy Lines", "Image", "Getty Images Custom Medical Stock Photo Rm", "Pa", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20526744.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PA-44916479.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
