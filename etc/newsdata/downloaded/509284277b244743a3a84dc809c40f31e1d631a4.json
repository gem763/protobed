Nor would they deploy People's Liberation Army troops, she said.\n\n\"But then you have to understand that these Chinese police are already here, they are already infiltrating the Hong Kong police force,\" said Ho, whose music has been banned in mainland China for her activism.\n\n\"We do expect there will be a huge number of people who would be going on the streets\" to protest on October 1, she said.\n\nThe Hong Kong demonstrations, which drew millions, began against a now scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland. They grew into a wider campaign for democracy, fueled by animosity towards the police, with hardcore protesters turning to violence.\n\nUnder the terms of the 1997 handover deal, the city has rights and liberties that do not exist on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and freedom of speech, but demonstrators say freedoms are being eroded by Beijing.\n\nIn Washington, Wong testified with Ho before the US Congress in support of a bill aimed at defending civil rights in Hong Kong.\n\nWearing a sports coat over his T-Shirt, Wong told AFP it is significant \"and remarkable\" that the US administration \"really pay much more attention to Hong Kong protests compared to five years ago.\"\n\nPart of the reason, he said, is the much larger scale that has seen thousands of tear gas rounds fired, 1,500 activists arrested and around 200 -- including himself -- prosecuted.\n\n- A global voice -\n\n\"Even I've been arrested, jailed for 120 days, the price I pay is really small,\" said the bespectacled Wong, noting that some protesters with riot-related charges could face 10 years behind bars.\n\n\"More important is the solidarity of Hong Kong people encourage me (to) continue in this fight, and my responsibility and my role is to let the voice of Hong Kong people\" be heard globally, said Wong, an activist since his early teens.\n\nHo, who also joined the Umbrella Movement and in addition became an advocate for LGBT rights, says she is unable to get brand or corporate sponsorships and even has difficulties finding concert venues in Hong Kong but \"I don't really think it is a sacrifice.\"\n\nShe says the protesters \"need to keep our spirits up\" but remain determined and very strong despite the \"very long battle ahead.\"\n\nAlthough the government is not backing down, \"they have really played out all their cards.\n\n\"So I guess at some point they do have to give in. It's just a matter of time.\"", "description": "Prominent Hong Kong protesters were flying home from Washington Saturday night buoyed by international support and determined to press on with their struggle well beyond two looming anniversaries.
