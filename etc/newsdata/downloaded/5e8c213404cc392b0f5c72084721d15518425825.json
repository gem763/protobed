About $10 million of the proposed savings will flow through to the bottom line in 2020. It will also sell off surplus land holdings.\n\nMr Miller said in late August that Adelaide Brighton would evaluate the Barro assets like any other potential acquisition opportunities if it did decide to go down that path.\n\n\"The Barro assets are no different to any other set of strategic assets,'' he said at the time.", "description": "The ACCC is investigating whether Barro's 43pc stake in Adelaide Brighton influences competition, particularly in ready-mix concrete.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c4df14d9c7daec8eb4c0929389197c545c024d18", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
