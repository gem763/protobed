The IDF had anticipated the move and placed several Iron Dome batteries to protect the region, so the attack did very little damage and several rockets were shot down.\n\nThere have been conflicting reports on whether the weapon used to attack Israel was a Russian built BM-27 Uragan or an indigenous Iranian Fajr-5.\n\nThe Fajr-5 system is an indigenous Iranian 333 mm artillery rocket that is mounted on Mercedes-Benz 2624 trucks in 4-tube launchers. System has a maximum range of 75 km and rather abysmal accuracy with a 3 km CEP. Combination of a 900 kg class conventional warhead and the low accuracy makes the FAJR-5 more of a terror weapon than any kind of precision battlefield instrument.\n\nThe Israeli Air-force had apparently been waiting for a provocation as the resulting counterattack against the launchers and the Iranian military infrastructure was an overwhelming one. Unlike in the response for the February drone incident, the IAF was well prepared with a large strike package that had a sizable SEAD element on hand.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Key point:\u00a0The F-35 operates on another level that Russia's air defense cannot handle.", "authors": ["Petri M\u00e4kel\u00e4"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DxN.Lq_MWQJl3qs0yHrFUw--~B/aD0xMDU1O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/0e41e0ee158c1b18f99c168bec3e394a", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
