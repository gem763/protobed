We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table,' Pence told reporters outside the White House.\n\nHe spoke just over two hours after Trump washed his hands publicly of the Kurds and invited 'Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte' to save them.\n\nTrump tweeted that he had put the fate of America's former Kurdish allies in the hands of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, whose regime he called 'our enemy' in the same breath.\n\nAnd he announced that his administration aims to punish Turkey's incursion into Syria by canceling a $100 billion trade agreement, hiking import tariffs on Turkish steel, and readying economic sanctions against anyone in Erdo\u011fan's government who threatens 'peace, security, or stability' in Syria.\n\nMission: Mike Pence is being sent to the Middle East to hold talks on peace but said: 'The United States of America did not give a green light for Turkey to invade Syria.' Erdogan moved his forces almost immediately after Trump signaled he would pull them out of northern Syria\n\nSanctions threat: Donald Trump announced the threat of sanctions against Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a Monday afternoon statement\n\nBut that same government is effectively holding around 50 U.S. nuclear weapons hostage at the strategically-vital air base at Incirlik, which stores part of the American nuclear deterrent and is also being used by Turkish planes to support its invasion of northern Syria.\n\nLawmakers from both sides of America's political divide have attacked Trump's approach - possibly prompting Pence's scramble to the Middle East.\n\nNancy Pelosi said after the sanctions were unveiled that she wanted to 'overturn' the pullout of troops.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that he was 'gravely concerned.' His Democratic counterpart Chuck Schumer blasted the president for what he called 'erratic, reckless decision making in Syria.'\n\nTurkey is a NATO ally. It's also the aggressor whose military incursion both the Syrian army and the Kurds are trying to push back. And sitting inside the Incirlik air base 250 miles inside Turkey, whose operation the U.S. has shared since the mid-1950s, are about 50 American tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nA senior U.S. official told The New York Times on Monday that the WMDs, though under American control, have effectively become Erdo\u011fan's hostages.\n\nThe United States has 180 of these weapons, precision-guided B61-12 nuclear bombs, spread across allied bases in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.\n\nLeaving a large number of them at Incirlik could become a deadly security risk in a nation whose artillery have already fired across the border on U.S. military units as they bugged out of Syria.\n\nPulling them out would signal an end to a military alliance that gives the United States a crucial staging ground for Middle East operations.\n\nHow Trump changed U.S. policy in Syria: Scroll down to read his full statement\n\nErdo\u011fan said in September that he 'cannot accept' international rules that stand in the way of Turkey obtaining its own nuclear weapons. Trump has already invited him to visit the White House in November.\n\nThe coming confluence of pressure points is stirring righteous anger and creating nervous uncertainty in Congress.\n\n'President Trump's erratic, reckless decision making in Syria has put Americans at risk & given a free hand to dictators \u2013 Putin, Assad, Erdogan,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on Twitter.\n\n'This is a dereliction of duty,' Schumer added. 'Republicans need to stand up to him now before more ISIS prisoners go free.'\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican Trump ally from Kentucky, piled on the scorn.\n\n'I am gravely concerned by recent events in Syria and by our nation's apparent response thus far,' he swiped at the White House.\n\n'Turkey is our NATO ally and has legitimate security concerns stemming from the conflict in Syria. But Turkey's offensive against our Syrian Kurdish partners is jeopardizing years of hard-won progress in the fight against ISIS.'\n\nMcConnell vented about a 'power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia' as a result of a U.S. withdrawal, and warned of a 'strategic calamity' to come.'\n\nAnd Pelosi said she wanrs Congress to produce bipartisan legislation to 'overturn' Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.\n\nThe Speaker said the measure must be stronger than the sanctions Trump unveiled. She had already said that she and Graham had spoken about a bipartisan measure to bar weapons sales to Turkey and impose sanctions on the U.S. assets of Turkish leaders.\n\nThe U.S. president's policy announcements, made in five tweets, completed a stunning reversal of eight days ago that has already seen Syrian and Turkish forces squaring off for full-blown armed conflict across a border hundreds of miles long.\n\nCaught in the middle as Turkey invades are a Kurdish minority, whom the U.S. trained and protected since 2014, shortly after Syria's Russia-backed army abandoned the vast region where they live at the height of a civil war.\n\nNow, Kurdish military units who once fought alongside American soldiers against the ISIS terror army are aligned with Assad against Turkey, which considers them terrorists.\n\nSyrian government troops have since assembled in Kurdish-controlled border towns to help push back Turkish fighters. Assad has so far allowed the Kurds to maintain political control of the region that they see as part of a future sovereign country stretching across parts of five nations.\n\nThe new alliance has quickly replaced the fragile one Trump crumbled in his fingers by announcing a troop pullout that drew near-universal condemnation.\n\n'Some people want the United States to protect the 7,000 mile away Border of Syria, presided over by Bashar al-Assad, our enemy,' he tweeted. 'At the same time, Syria and whoever they chose to help, wants naturally to protect the Kurds. I would much rather focus on our Southern Border.'\n\nTrump may not have had practical choices other than a withdrawal or the sort of long-term military heel-digging that he has publicly railed again.\n\n'Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me,' he tweeted, 'whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!'\n\nInstead of focusing on the Kurds' long-term survival, which is itself bound up with that of other Kurdish populations in Iran and Iraq, the president chose Monday to rattle sabers in Erdogan's direction.\n\n'Turkey's military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region. I have been perfectly clear with President Erdo\u011fan: Turkey's action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,' he warned in a lengthy written statement.\n\n'Turkey must ensure the safety of civilians, including religious and ethnic minorities, and is now, or may be in the future, responsible for the ongoing detention of ISIS terrorists in the region.'\n\nSyrian government forces have begun moving into Kurdish territory to defend against a Turkish invasion of northern Syria after striking a deal with the former US allies. Assad's troops were seen near Manbij on Monday as Erdogan said his forces were ready to attack. Syrian troops also arrived in Ain Issa and Sari Kani, where fighting is already underway\n\nTurks move in: Turkish infantry troops and a light armored vehicle were on patrol in Tukhar, inside Syria, Monday\n\nStrategic location: Incirlik air base has been jointly operated by the USAF and Turkish forces since the 1950s. Erdo\u011fan's 'Operation Peace Spring' - his invasion of northern Syria - is being supported by Turkish air power taking off from the same base where around 50 U.S. nuclear weapons are stored\n\nU.S. presence: A KC-135 is refueled before the sudden change in relations between the U.S. and Turkey. Incirlik's location means it is used by the USAF as a staging post to the further Middle East and was instrumental to defeating ISIS\n\nWhat's stored at Incirlik: Around 50 B61 bombs are in the air base's inventory\n\nThreatening economic sanctions, Trump said he is 'fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path.'\n\nThe president's tweets in the hour that preceded that statement, written in his own disjointed voice, criticized European nations for their unwillingness to hold ISIS detainees who left their countries to wage jihad.\n\n'I offered ISIS prisoners to the European countries from where they came, and was rejected on numerous occasions. They probably figured that the U.S. would bear the tremendous cost as always!' he tweeted.\n\nHis more formal statement boasted that 'United States forces have defeated the ISIS physical caliphate,' and tweaked his previous statements to indicate that some servicemen and women will remain in Syria to prevent new flare-ups.\n\n'United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq,' he said.\n\n'A small footprint of United States forces will remain at At Tanf Garrison in southern Syria to continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS.'\n\nBoth the Syrian and Russian governments consider the presence of that small U.S. base to be illegal. It houses an estimated 200 military personnel.\n\nDONALD TRUMP'S STATEMENT N SANCTIONING TURKEY October 14, 2019 I will soon be issuing an Executive Order authorizing the imposition of sanctions against current and former officials of the Government of Turkey and any persons contributing to Turkey's destabilizing actions in northeast Syria. Likewise, the steel tariffs will be increased back up to 50 percent, the level prior to reduction in May. The United States will also immediately stop negotiations, being led by the Department of Commerce, with respect to a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey. This Order will enable the United States to impose powerful additional sanctions on those who may be involved in serious human rights abuses, obstructing a ceasefire, preventing displaced persons from returning home, forcibly repatriating refugees, or threatening the peace, security, or stability in Syria. The Order will authorize a broad range of consequences, including financial sanctions, the blocking of property, and barring entry into the United States. Since my first day in office, the Trump Administration has worked tirelessly to preserve the safety and security of the United States and its citizens. The United States and our partners have liberated 100 percent of ISIS's ruthless territorial caliphate. Turkey must not put these gains in jeopardy. Turkey must also prioritize the protection of civilians, particularly vulnerable ethnic and religious minorities in northeast Syria. Indiscriminate targeting of civilians, destruction of civilian infrastructure, and targeting of ethnic or religious minorities is unacceptable. Additionally, the return of refugees must be conducted in a safe, voluntary, and dignified manner. Turkey's military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region. I have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey's action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes. Turkey must ensure the safety of civilians, including religious and ethnic minorities, and is now, or may be in the future, responsible for the ongoing detention of ISIS terrorists in the region. Unfortunately, Turkey does not appear to be mitigating the humanitarian effects of its invasion. As I have said, I am withdrawing the remaining United States service members from northeast Syria. As United States forces have defeated the ISIS physical caliphate, United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq. A small footprint of United States forces will remain at At Tanf Garrison in southern Syria to continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS. The United States will aggressively use economic sanctions to target those who enable, facilitate, and finance these heinous acts in Syria. I am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path.\n\nTurkey's Syrian allies accuses of 'executing' Kurdish civilians as Erdogan's forces storm across the border\n\nThe United States said Monday it was appalled and seeking more information after accounts that pro-Turkish fighters in Syria have summarily executed civilians including a female Kurdish politician.\n\nThe Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces said that at least nine civilians were 'executed' as part of Turkey's invasion that it launched Wednesday against the former U.S. allies.\n\nAmong them was 35-year-old Hevrin Khalaf, the secretary-general of the Future Syria Party, who according to the forces was taken out of her car and killed by Turkish-allied Syrian forces.\n\n'We find these reports to be extremely troubling, reflecting the overall destabilization of northeast Syria since the commencement of hostilities,' a U.S. State Department official said.\n\nExecute? Mourners attend a funeral for Kurdish political leader Hevrin Khalaf and others including civilians and Kurdish fighters in the northeastern Syrian Kurdish town of Derik. The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces say she was 'executed' by Turkish allies\n\n'We condemn in the strongest of terms any mistreatment and extrajudicial execution of civilians or prisoners, and are looking further into these circumstances,' the official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper, in an interview Sunday on CBS, said that a grisly video purportedly of Khalaf's killing could not be confirmed but, if true, the killings of civilians 'would be war crimes.'\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces spearheaded the fight against the Islamic State group in alliance with the United States.\n\nBut Turkey links them to Kurdish separatists at home and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered the operation after speaking to President Donald Trump, who pulled out US troops who served as a buffer.\n\nThe State Department official said that the United States on Sunday also pulled out of Syria civilian officers who were working on stabilization.\n\nTrump says that the United States no longer has a need a presence in Syria after fighting the Islamic State group and should instead focus at home.\n\nRepresentative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat, pointed to Khalaf's killing as she denounced Trump as a 'dangerous man' and, echoing retired US general John Allen, said he had 'blood on his hands.'\n\nDeal with the devil: The terrifying tinder box Donald Trump has ignited as the Kurds are forced to seek help from their former foe Bashar al-Assad after the USA's 'betrayal'\n\nByLarisa Brown On The Turkey-syria Border For The Daily Mail\n\nLast winter I was welcomed into the home of a Kurdish family who had fought alongside Britain and the US against Islamic State.\n\nAgainst the odds they had driven the barbaric fanatics from Kobane in northern Syria. The fighting was so brutal it was compared to the Second World War battle of Stalingrad.\n\nYet now, with Turkish warplanes dominating the skies, they face a fresh siege and more bloodshed.\n\nA wounded child injured in an alleged Turkish airstrike receives medical treatment at a hospital in Tal Tamr, northeastern Syria on October 13, 2019\n\nTurkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has designated Kobane as inside a 20-mile 'safe zone' for his war against Kurdish militia.\n\nThe military offensive began six days ago following Donald Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from the border area.\n\nThe Kurds have had to strike a 'deal with the devil' \u2013 asking their former foe, Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, to protect them.\n\nThe family home I visited last year is now abandoned and my hosts have fled, along with thousands of Kobane residents. The city has come under heavy Turkish shelling.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who were the US-led coalition's 'boots on the ground' during the fight against IS and who lost 11,000 fighters, say President Trump's move was a betrayal.\n\nTurkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has designated Kobane as inside a 20-mile 'safe zone' for his war against Kurdish militia\n\nIn a shocking video shared online, a mother cradling her dying daughter after fleeing Kobane, cries: 'America sold us out to Turkey. They are murdering us and our children. Where are the rights of the Kurdish people? Aren't we human because we are Kurds speaking Kurdish?\n\n'I have nowhere to go and nowhere to live. Where will I go if they steal my homeland Kobane?\n\n'Why was Erdogan not doing anything while Islamic State was attacking Kobane and beheading our children?'\n\nMustafa Al-Ali, who was born in the city, expressed his fury at Washington and London for failing to intervene, despite still having special forces in the area.\n\n'Turkey was shelling randomly and everybody was screaming and crying,' he added. 'People started heading to the US base. They wanted to be protected, everyone is trying to find a safe area.\n\n'Kobane was the first city that defeated Islamic State. We lost so many people and now Turkey is shelling it and nobody is doing anything. The Kurdish people have been fighting IS to protect the UK and the US and we have been betrayed.\n\nSmoke billows above the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad on October 13, 2019, as Turkish-backed forces push their offensive against Kurdish forces to take territory along the border\n\n'Everyone is trying to find a safe area. If Turkey carries on there will be an ethnic genocide of the people of Kobane.'\n\nThe assault forced the Kurds to make the pact with Assad on Sunday. Details of the agreement are unclear but it appeared to temporarily calm nerves despite Assad's regime having brutally suppressed the Kurds in the past.\n\nResidents in Kobane, which is described as the heart and soul of the Kurdish people, said they had been faced with a simple choice between the dictator or genocide at Turkey's hands.\n\nKobane resident Said Mostafa Habbu said: 'The whole world stands against us, this is murder that is being committed against us. The whole world sees what is happening and the [Western] coalition has a hand in it.\n\n'They have been here for a long time, then they agreed among themselves and left us. The solution for us is the regime. We are part of Syria.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian fighters sit atop an armoured personnel carrier in the southwestern neighbourhoods of the border Syrian town of Tal Abyad\n\n'I see no better than that now. Otherwise we would have faced a genocide like the Armenians.'\n\nAnother resident, Farid Jumaa, said: 'If the regime came in now it would be very good. What can we do? We have to.'\n\nBut not everyone was happy with the defensive pact. A former petroleum worker from the countryside near Kobane, who did not want to be named, said the Assad regime could not be trusted.\n\nHe added: 'For the Syrian Democratic Forces this is a deal with the devil. Assad would kill his people just to stay president.' The latest fighting in Syria began last Wednesday when Mr Erdogan launched Operation Peace Spring. He considers the US-backed SDF to be a terrorist group that supports separatists in Turkey.\n\nYesterday he said he believed his forces would easily take Kobane despite the arrival in the area of Russian-backed Syrian troops. 'It looks like Turkey's operation won't have any problems,' he said.\n\nMr Erdogan promised he would keep up the fight against the Kurdish militia until 'ultimate victory' was secured. Turkey has the second largest army in Nato.\n\nMourners attend the funeral of five Syrian Democratic Forces' fighters killed in battles against Turkey-led forces in the flashpoint town of Ras al-Ain along the border, on October 14, 2019\n\nThe European Union issued its strongest statement yet yesterday, saying it condemned Turkey's 'military attack' on Syria. It called on 'all member states to stop selling any kinds of arms' to Ankara.\n\nMeanwhile the escape of hundreds of jihadi brides from a camp in Syria has raised fears of terrorists returning to the UK.\n\nTooba Gondal, an alleged IS recruiter, is among those thought to be on the run from the detention facility near Ain Assa.\n\nThe site in north-east Syria was attacked by IS sleeper cells. Zara Iqbal, who has pleaded to return to Britain after travelling to the war zone with her sister Reema and their children from east London, was known to have been in the camp.\n\nThree orphans, also thought to be from London, were rescued from the Ain Issa camp yesterday. A Save the Children spokesman said that Amira, ten, Heba, eight, and Hamza, six, had been taken to a centre for lone children. Their parents died fighting for IS.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wehbe Romi in Kobane.", "description": "Donald Trump phoned\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan and demanded an immediate end to Turkey's invasion of northern Syria, vice president Mike Pence claimed.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Larisa Brown On The Turkey-Syria Border For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/21/19709204-0-image-a-73_1571084510963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
