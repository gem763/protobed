A dad and his two sons, smiling at the camera, the blue water of the KwaZulu-Natal coast in the background.\n\nLittle did Andr\u00e9 (42) and his brother, Werner Dry (40), both from the East Rand, Gauteng, know that would be the last picture they ever took with their dad, Gerhard (71).\n\nJust a day after the picture was taken on Durban\u2019s main beach on 6 October during their family holiday, Gerhard drowned after getting caught in a riptide.\n\nThey fought hard to keep his head above water and swim to safety, Andr\u00e9 told YOU on Tuesday. But it was futile.\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly traumatic to experience. I think we\u2019re still both in shock,\u201d he says.\n\nGerhard and his two sons had been on holiday and decided to go for a swim.\n\n\u201cThe sea was rough but we didn\u2019t go in too deep. Everything happened so fast \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to explain to anyone. A current pulled my dad in and both of us tried to get him out of it.\n\n\u201cI decided to swim to shore to alert the lifeguards but in the meantime Werner and my dad were pulled further and further out to sea.\u201d\n\nFour lifeguards went into the ocean. They struggled for a long time to bring Gerhard and Werner to shore, Andr\u00e9 says.\n\n\u201cIf it had been one minute longer,\u201d he adds, clearly emotional, \u201cthen my brother might also have been gone now. He held my dad\u2019s hand the whole time. He\u2019d promised him he\u2019d never let go.\n\n\u201cLater, they were in so deep they couldn\u2019t stand. When the lifeguards brought them out, my dad was unconscious. They applied CPR for 40 minutes, but it was too late. We couldn\u2019t revive my dad. He was declared dead right there on the beach.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a huge shock to both him and his brother, Andr\u00e9 says. Especially because their father had loved nature and the ocean so much.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually so painfully ironic. He loved the outdoors, walking and swimming and just being out in nature. He was extremely fit and healthy \u2013 especially for a 71-year-old. The day before he died, when we took the picture, he told us how much he enjoyed being by the sea with his two sons.\n\n\u201cHe always used to say how much peace he has when he\u2019s at the seaside, how happy he is. And a day later, his life was taken by the thing he loved the most.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re a close family, he says. For four decades, Gerhard had been the head of the department of parks and recreation in Springs, Gauteng.\n\n\u201cHe was a man of integrity. He\u2019d touched so many people\u2019s life. Even years after he\u2019d retired, locals would tell us how much they miss him. He\u2019d had such a passion for his work \u2013 and for life. He always used to say, \u2018My child, life is short. If you want to do something, you must do it now\u2019.\u201d\n\nGerhard \u201cnever recovered\u201d from the death of his wife, Louise, 14 years ago. She died of cancer.\n\n\u201cYou know, not a day would go by that he wouldn\u2019t talk about her. He missed her so much. For 14 years he suffered. He loved her incredibly deeply and never let another woman into his life.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re holding onto as consolation: that they\u2019ve been reunited after 14 years and that he\u2019s happy now.\u201d\n\nWerner posted on Facebook, \u201cAndr\u00e9 and I have never felt so alone as we do now, and we\u2019re still expecting dad to come home from a walk. Dad was our hero but after our mom\u2019s death he never recovered. We hope you\u2019re together and happy. Don\u2019t worry about me and my elder brother \u2013 we have each other. Love you, Mom and Dad, always.\u201d\n\nThe family are planning a memorial service later this week. Funeral plans have yet to be finalised.", "description": "\u201cIt was incredibly traumatic to experience.
