He faces an uphill climb in trying to make that happen.\n\nMcLellan, who was named coach on April 15, inherited a roster with five players age 32 or older that had the fewest points in the Western Conference last season, scored the second-fewest goals in the league and was 29th out of 31 teams in penalty killing.\n\nThat\u2019s why McLellan has modest expectations for what will be considered a success this season.\n\n\u201cGrowth. Everyone has to improve in every facet of the game,\u201d McLellan said early in training camp. \u201cI think I\u2019ve said this before. Old dogs have to learn new tricks, and the new dogs have to be prepared and open to absorb and be professional.\u201d\n\nMcLellan spent most of training camp trying to get all his players on the same page. They have spent as much time in front of the white board as they have skating.\n\nMcLellan, who had previous stints with Pacific Division rivals San Jose and Edmonton, wants the Kings to be more aggressive on the forecheck and also to be quicker to the puck. Whether that can work with one of the league\u2019s oldest lineups, remains to be seen.\n\nEarly reviews by players about McLellan have been positive. Ilya Kovalchuk said the Kings are hoping to exceed expectations even though many think LA\u2019s best days are behind it.\n\n\u201cI believe we still got it. In this league you never know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the St. Louis Blues won the Stanley Cup, they were the last team in the whole league by Jan. 6 or something. So you just have to work hard and together as a team cause you can\u2019t just be bunch of individuals. We have some new guys coming, but we have a core that knows how to win and that\u2019s most important.\u201d\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE: Defenseman Ben Hutton was signed Sept. 18 with Derek Forbort (back) and Paul LaDue (knee) likely not ready for the start of the regular season. Hutton spent four seasons with Vancouver. He had 20 points in 69 games last season but also posted a career-worst minus-23 rating, which is why he wasn\u2019t extended a qualifying offer. Fellow defenseman Joakim Ryan, who spent his entire career with San Jose, also provides some experience. The Kings also added forwards Mario Kempe and Martin Frk, but they might have a tough time breaking into the lineup.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT: The Kings bought out veteran defenseman Dion Phaneuf while forward Brendan Leipsic signed with Washington. LA dealt some prospects near the trade deadline for draft picks.\n\nKEY PLAYERS: F Anze Kopitar scored 60 points last season, which was a 32-point decrease from 2017-18. He is expected to bounce back and have increased production this season, but probably not on the level of two years ago.\n\nKovalchuk had a nightmare return to the NHL last year, with just 34 points and at one point being demoted to the fourth line. McLellan has lauded the Russian during training camp, saying he is more engaged and buying into the new system.\n\nGoaltender Jonathan Quick was hampered by injuries and was in net for only 46 games. This could be the year he is traded after Jack Campbell was signed to a two-year extension prior to the start of training camp\n\nOUTLOOK: Los Angeles is looking to avoid missing the playoffs in multiple seasons for the first time since 2008-09 but has an aging roster with large contracts, which doesn\u2019t give the Kings much salary cap flexibility.\n\nVeteran defenseman Drew Doughty knows the team is in a rebuilding phase. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we got to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a new team, we\u2019re rebuilding, we\u2019re going to be younger. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised if we make trades this year. We just got to be better.\u201d\n\nPREDICTION: The Kings should improve on last season\u2019s point total but are expected to miss the playoffs and be near the bottom of the Western Conference. The most interesting month of the season figures to be February as they\u2019re likely to be in the trade market again and making the slow steps necessary to rebuild the roster.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Todd McLellan wants to make the Los Angeles Kings playoff contenders again.
