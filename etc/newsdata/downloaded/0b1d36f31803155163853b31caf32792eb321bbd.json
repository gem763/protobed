Ole Miss coach Matt Luke described Corral\u2019s status as \u201cday to day.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was out there yesterday, didn\u2019t do a whole lot,\u201d Luke said at his Monday news conference. \u201cHe\u2019ll be out there tomorrow, and we\u2019ll know more after practice tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBoth teams have reason to feel good about their backup plans if the starters aren\u2019t available.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s Garrett Shrader was named the SEC freshman of the week after making his first career start in place of Stevens last week. Shrader went 17 of 22 for 180 yards and an interception while also rushing for 125 yards on 11 carries against Kentucky.\n\nOle Miss freshman John Rhys Plumlee replaced an injured Corral in the fourth quarter with Ole Miss trailing Cal 28-13. His 47-yard run set up a touchdown that cut the margin to 28-20. Plumlee then drove Ole Miss 89 yards in the closing minutes before he was stuffed on a quarterback sneak attempt from the 1-yard line as time expired.\n\n\u201cHe brought a spark into the stadium and on the sideline,\u201d Luke said. \u201cMoving forward, what he can bring with his legs, especially against a really good defense, I think that addition gives (opponents) something else to prepare for. Because Matt and John Rhys are so different, they have to go into the game preparing for both. Again, you hope that Matt is healthy and they have to prepare for both of them. That is the goal, to get them healthy and have both of them available.\u201d\n\nMississippi State also is wondering whether it will have all its quarterbacks available this week.\n\nInjuries forced Stevens to leave early in a victory over Southern Mississippi and a loss to No. 24 Kansas State before he sat out the entire Kentucky game.\n\nMoorhead said Shrader would start again Saturday if Stevens is unable to go.\n\nStevens has completed 65.5 percent of his passes for 441 yards with five touchdowns and two interceptions, and he also has rushed for 42 yards and two touchdowns on 24 carries. Shrader has completed 62.2 percent of his passes for 302 yards with no touchdowns and one interception, and he\u2019s run for 223 yards and one touchdown on 30 carries.\n\nWhile Mississippi State measures Stevens\u2018 progress, Ole Miss is checking to see whether Corral will be ready to go against Alabama. Luke said Corral was \u201cpretty sore\u201d on Sunday but started \u201cfeeling a little bit better\u201d on Monday.\n\n\u201cYou have to see how he progresses, how confident he is in the injury, and can he do everything,\u201d Luke said. \u201cCan he pull it and run it? How is he? Again, you are going with the guys you think will help you win the football game, and I don\u2019t think you can make that call until you see him go out there at practice.\u201d\n\nCorral has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 844 yards with four touchdown passes and one interception this season.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mississippi and Mississippi State are both dealing with injury-related quarterback uncertainty as they prepare for road tests with top-10 teams this week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/mississippi_st_qb_situation_football_29852_c0-214-5119-3198_s1770x1032.jpg?401d8bc6cbe3551953ff6e499389216632643b0f", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
