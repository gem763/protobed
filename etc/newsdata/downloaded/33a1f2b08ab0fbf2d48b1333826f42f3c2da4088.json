Johnson has chosen a confrontation. The remaining options are the original, Northern Ireland-only backstop with some modifications, or an extension.\"\n\nIrish deputy PM Mr Coveney said he had not been shown anything officially, but said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see. Obviously we\u2019ll study any proposal carefully, but if the reports are true it doesn\u2019t look like the basis of an agreement, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\u201cOur position has been consistent, respectful and clear. If there is to be an alternative to the backstop it has got to do the same job as the backstop, which means no physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland, and no related checks or controls.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you would be putting a customs border effectively between Northern Ireland and the Republic is not something that is consistent with that, or even close.\u201d\n\nThe T\u00e1naiste also cast doubt on whether the UK was serious about finding a deal, given the tin-eared nature of the proposals coming out of London.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The formal proposals are expected to be sent to Brussels after the close of his speech.\n\nUK government officials have not questioned the fundamentals of the leaks \u2013 though they dispute unspecified \"elements\". The UK side is blaming Dublin for making the plans public ahead of Mr Johnson's speech.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It's talking about a time limit, which again is not acceptable, but it's still talking about the need and the requirement for customs checks.\n\n\"Again, to go back to the commitments, it's no infrastructure or associated checks, protecting the Good Friday agreement and the areas of cooperation, protecting the all-Ireland economy, and protecting the single market and our place in it. If that's what's being proposed it certainly doesn't do any of that.\"\n\nThe British proposals again managed to unite Ireland's political parties in condemnation. Lisa Chambers, Fianna F\u00e1il Spokesperson on Brexit told the same programme: \"The entire Oireachtas [Irish parliament] supports that position. If that's actually the proposal from the UK government you'd really have to question is there a sincere effort to get a deal done.\n\n\"I think a deal can be done, and I think that Boris Johnson is running out of options. But if they actually put those proposals on paper to Brussels and support a time-limited backstop just for regulations and customs checks immediately, they know that won't wash, they know that won't be accepted. You have to ask the question are they putting those proposals there knowing they're going to be rejected because they're pursuing a no-deal policy?\"\n\nBack in Brussels, a European Commission spokesperson said: \u201cOnce received, we will examine [the UK text] objectively and in light of well-known criteria. President Juncker will speak on the phone to prime minister Boris Johnson this afternoon. Technical talks with the UK team will also take place... We will update the European Parliament Brexit steering group and Council this evening.\u201d", "description": "The Irish government has flatly rejected a leaked version of Boris Johnson's Brexit plan for the Irish border, ahead of its official unveiling on Wednesday.
