His August report discussed one aspect of the Trump-Russia investigation \u2014 Comey\u2019s mishandling of his memos of conversations with Trump and leaking of information on retired Gen. Michael Flynn. Both reports were unsparing in their critiques of Comey\u2019s tendency to violate DOJ and FBI policies and to act on his feelings instead.\n\n\u201cWe have previously faulted Comey for acting unilaterally and inconsistent with Department policy,\u201d Horowitz wrote last month. \u201cComey\u2019s unauthorized disclosure of sensitive law enforcement information about the Flynn investigation merits similar criticism.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little reason to believe Horowitz\u2019s next report won\u2019t be as bad or worse for Comey. Since 2018, Horowitz has been reviewing the FISA surveillance warrants targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, and the watchdog is likely scrutinizing every aspect of the FISA approval process, including the FBI\u2019s extensive use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele through funding from the Clinton campaign. The head of the FBI plays an integral role in the FISA process \u2014 Comey signed and approved three of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals.\n\nSteele put his salacious allegations together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which had been hired by the Clinton campaign through its law firm, Perkins Coie. The FBI knew Steele was desperate for Trump to lose, his dossier was flawed, and he was receiving funding from Clinton, but these facts weren\u2019t revealed to the FISA Court.\n\nHorowitz\u2019s 568-page report on the Clinton investigation was released in June 2018, concluding Comey\u2019s actions were \u201cextraordinary and insubordinate\u201d when he announced Clinton wouldn\u2019t be charged in a speech on July 5, 2016. Comey said Clinton\u2019s email practices were \u201cextremely careless\u201d but also believed \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring charges against her. Comey\u2019s speech was criticized by both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nComey gave the speech after Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s tarmac meeting with President Bill Clinton in June 2016. Comey told Horowitz he feared that Lynch making the decision to decline charges against Clinton would result in \u201ccorrosive doubt\u201d about the process, so Comey wanted to ensure \u201ca sense of justice more broadly in the country \u2014 that things are fair not fixed, and they\u2019re done independently.\u201d Horowitz wrote that \u201cComey did not raise any of these concerns with Lynch\u201d beforehand and concealed his intentions from the DOJ until the morning of his speech. Horowitz didn\u2019t find Comey\u2019s explanations reasonable or persuasive.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that Comey\u2019s unilateral announcement was inconsistent with Department policy and violated long-standing Department practice and protocol by, among other things, criticizing Clinton\u2019s uncharged conduct,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201dWe also found that Comey usurped the authority of the Attorney General, and inadequately and incompletely described the legal position of Department prosecutors.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump fired Comey in May 2017, he cited a letter written by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein which referenced Horowitz\u2019s critiques.\n\nHorowitz\u2019s 83-page report in August harshly criticized Comey\u2019s decision to remove his memos from the FBI after he was fired and to provide contents from the memos to a friend to leak to the media. Comey testified in 2017 that he hoped leaking this information \u201cmight prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\u201d Horowitz concluded Comey\u2019s leaks were \u201can attempt to force the Department to take official investigative actions.\u201d Horowitz said Comey violated the FBI\u2019s guidelines, making it clear it was unacceptable for Comey to use official FBI documents to advance his own goals.\n\n\u201cComey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,\u201d Horowitz wrote. \u201cWhat was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\u201d\n\nComey told Horowitz he \u201chad to\u201d to take these actions \u201cif I love this country \u2026 and I love the Department of Justice and I love the FBI.\u201d But DOJ\u2019s watchdog again shot down Comey\u2019s reasoning and said the fired bureau director \u201cset a dangerous example\u201d for the rest of the FBI.\n\nHorowitz\u2019s sent a criminal referral to DOJ over Comey\u2019s memos, but DOJ declined to prosecute. Whether that pattern will repeat itself following the upcoming FISA report remains to be seen.\n\nComey defended the FBI\u2019s use of the Steele dossier earlier this year, saying the FBI tried to see how much of the unverified information could be replicated. But he admitted the dossier wasn't verified when it was used in the three FISA filings he signed off on them and certified them as verified, saying \u201cthat work was ongoing when I was fired.\u201d\n\nHorowitz\u2019s highly anticipated report is expected in the coming weeks.", "description": "Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has already harshly criticized James Comey in two high-profile investigations, so the watchdog\u2019s impending report on abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act could spell trouble for the former FBI director.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/787b95c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4444x2333+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F5a%2F89%2F7b5344ef4525b9cd2932715229c4%2Fjames-comey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
