I assumed it was a traffic accident - not something we would usually cover.\n\nBut then I received an alert on my phone, the local authorities announcing there had been an attack. I didn't stop to wonder what it was, I grabbed my cameras and set out on my motorbike.\n\nI couldn't get through on my motorbike and, as I parked, I noticed there was a body lying on the curb. It was when I looked into my rearview mirror that I saw all the other bodies just behind me.\n\nAround a dozen bodies, some already covered with tablecloths taken from nearby restaurants, lay on the seaside promenade. Police and soldiers - many pointing their guns - were still in a state of confusion.\n\nThe conditions were very difficult, it was dark, police trying to stop us work ... and some people there were aggressive. I understood. The situation was very chaotic.\n\nThe doll photo went viral on the Internet, often mis-captioned by the site, saying it showed a dead child beneath the foil emergency blanket. But in fact nobody knows for sure the age of the victim.\n\nGiven size of the victim, I don't think it was a child. I don't know why the doll is there. Was it a parent who was with a child - hence the doll? Did someone put the doll there at some point? Everyone has asked me.\n\nWhen you go to a war you know it's a hostile environment, you expect to see some unpleasant things but I was very shaken by what I saw that night because the horror had come home to my city, Nice. The attack happened just 500 meters from my home and during France\u2019s traditionally festive Bastille Day setting.'", "description": "From Syria's festering conflict to the Bastille Day attack in Nice, Reuters photographers have been on the scene to record the biggest news stories this year.", "authors": ["Reuters Photographers"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ_L2Wnoxq0MQnRYJI3kE0Jm-I5YKL3Fyhr1FIpEsPCoQohxLUM1w_WWuNHIC1ce1dRgGBPyJHTtyPHgBsEElOpqpKSyHZFFjeHb_77YiynXb"}
