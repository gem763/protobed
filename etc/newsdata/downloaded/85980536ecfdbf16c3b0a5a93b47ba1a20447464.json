Two compounds, HOCI (hypochlorous acid) and Cl2 (chlorine gas) are given off by bleach cleaning products. The fumes build up in poorly ventilated homes. They then react with the chemical limonene. Limonene is commonly used in air fresheners, sprays and surface wipes to give off a citrus smell. When they react, they produce a variety of volatile compounds. When these volatile compounds are exposed to light - either sunlight or from lamps - they produce secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). These particles irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can cause headaches, nausea, as well as damage to the liver and kidneys.\n\nThe researchers, led by Professor Chen Wang, warn they could pose a serious health risk to the public.\n\nHowever, the team of academics note that health effects of these particles need to be studied further.\n\nThey found that indoor lighting or sunshine through windows split the compounds HOCl and Cl2.\n\nThis process made them more susceptible to reacting with the air fresheners to form SOAs.\n\nPrevious studies have shown SOAs, also produced by aromatherapy oils, cause eye and airway irritation.\n\nProfessor Wang told MailOnline: 'I recommend people to not mix different cleaning products, for example do not mix bleach with a terpene cleaner.\n\n'I also recommend to ventilate the home during cleaning - for example, open the windows - which will decrease indoor concentrations of cleaning emissions.\n\n'Fine particles are only formed in presence of light, because light split the compounds from bleach, and reacts with limonene.\n\n'We observed reaction of limonene with bleach emissions in the dark, but not particle formation. That's not to say they are not harmful without light.\n\n'Likewise, we won't say it is harmful, because this requires identification of the reaction products and health studies in the future.'\n\nThe findings are published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.", "description": "Canadian scientists discovered fumes from bleach cleaning products reacted with chemicals given off by air fresheners.
