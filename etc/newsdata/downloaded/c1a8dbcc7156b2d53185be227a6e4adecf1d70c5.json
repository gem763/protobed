It's ridiculous,' Mr Henderson said.\n\n'Obviously the app is inefficient and can't identify where you are.\n\n'I believe they should at least look at the situation and get back to the people that have made the app to refine it, there's an issue there.'\n\nMr Henderon was fined due to a glitch in the app, which registered his Cloyne Road parking spot for Marshall Lane, which is just metres away\n\nA spokesman for the council said parking fine appeals are dealt with on a case-to-case basis with the City's Penalty Infringement Review Policy.\n\nMr Henderson said he would've happily paid for the fine if he was in the wrong.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted the City of Gold Coast Council for further comment.", "description": "David Henderson paid $6.60 for an all-day parking spot on Cloyne Road, Southport, in Queensland via the council's EasyPark app at about 9am on Thursday.", "authors": ["Paula Ahillon For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/03/19424038-0-image-a-30_1570502606853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
