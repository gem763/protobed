You are courageous & strong. You are loved. You see, Amari, you may not feel it now, but you have a power that threatens their core. I can't wait to watch you use it and thrive.

Racial hate crimes are abhorrent but racial hate crimes committed by pre-teens are \u201csign of the apocalypse\u201d material, an irresistible peg for stories about America regressing on race relations.\n\nBut this story had an extra media-friendly angle. The school at which the alleged incident took place happens to be the school at which Mike Pence\u2019s wife, Karen, teaches art part-time, a fact many reports made a point of noting even though it had nothing to do with the allegations. The implication was that Trump\u2019s effect on racial harmony had supposedly been demonstrated in the most lurid way in the place where his own VP\u2019s wife works.\n\nBut no, it hadn\u2019t. The girl made it up.\n\nThe 12-year-old, who is African American, said three white boy students held her down in a school playground a week ago during recess, covered her mouth, called her insulting names and used scissors to cut her hair\u2026 \u201cTo those young boys and their parents, we sincerely apologize for the pain and anxiety these allegations have caused,\u201d [her] grandparents wrote in a statement sent to The Washington Post by the school. \u201cTo the administrators and families of Immanuel Christian School, we are sorry for the damage this incident has done to trust within the school family and the undue scorn it has brought to the school. To the broader community, who rallied in such passionate support for our daughter, we apologize for betraying your trust.\u201d \u201cWe understand there will be consequences and we\u2019re prepared to take responsibility for them,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe know that it will take time to heal, and we hope and pray that the boys, their families, the school and the broader community will be able to forgive us in time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an admirably forthright apology, especially considering that her grandmother had called for the three boys to be expelled. And 12-year-olds deserve leeway to make mistakes, although \u2026 inventing a hate crime that involved the police and drew major media attention is a pretty big one. She was awfully convincing too, shedding tears for the cameras in a local news interview last week.\n\nTONIGHT AT 11: \u201cOne of them put my hands behind my back. One of them covered my mouth. They kept on laughing and calling me names,\u201d said Amari who had her locs cut by bullies at a private #VA school. #Springfield I was heartbroken just listening to this.

According to the local NBC affiliate, footage from security cameras at the school proved that she and the boys weren\u2019t at the scene of the attack at the time the girl claimed it happened. She \u2018fessed up and is now seeking counseling. One obvious question is what her motive was; the girl had claimed that the three boys bullied her repeatedly over the past month, calling her \u201cugly,\u201d taking away her lunches, etc. Her family\u2019s lawyer told NBC today that she still insists that she\u2019s been bullied, just not to the point of anyone holding her down and cutting her hair. (The school had no record of her being bullied as of three days ago.) Did she invent the attack as revenge, or as a way to make the school\u2019s staff pay closer attention to how other students were treating her?\n\nAnd how did the attack scenario occur to her? Did she read about an incident like that somewhere or fabricate the whole thing?\n\nAnyway, there\u2019s a lesson here for the media but that lesson won\u2019t be heeded so let\u2019s not even bother.", "description": "Hoax.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/m-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
