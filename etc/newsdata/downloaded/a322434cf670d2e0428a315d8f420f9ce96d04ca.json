But the reality is that TV is still TV. It\u2019s a storytelling medium broken up by the rigid demands of scheduling and time slots, where the needs of the narrative are sometimes undercut by the need to fill 22 or 44 minutes \u2014 and no more.\n\nAll of this is a prelude to saying that The Good Place\u2019s latest chapter seems awfully slight, at least in comparison to this show at its craziest and most ambitious. But perhaps\u2019s that\u2019s to be expected. Even the most inventive television plots require at least some laborious set-up.\n\nThis week\u2019s episode primarily completes the thoughts begun in the two-part season premiere. \u201cA Girl from Arizona\u201d introduced the remaining participants in the new Neighborhood experiment, and gave Eleanor a head start on bringing Brent and Simone into line. This week, Tahani deals with her John problem, while the rest of the gang handles Chidi, who\u2019s become an unexpected complication. Most of the half-hour feels like housekeeping, meant to get this final season ready for its real action\u2026 which is teased by a closing image of a hooded figure on a railroad hand-car, moving rapidly toward our heroes.\n\nThe scary hooded thing will have to wait, though. This episode is more aptly called \u201cChillaxing,\u201d which is a new(ish) portmanteau coined by Michael, combining \u201cChidi\u201d and \u201crelaxing.\u201d It describes the state Chidi\u2019s in when this story begins: Happy and untroubled in paradise, and not bothered in the least when Brent bails on his ethics class after one session. (It turns out that the B+ Princeton student thinks he should be leading the class, not taking it.) Even when Eleanor tries to appeal to Chidi\u2019 sense of responsibility, asking, \u201cWhat would Kant say about your duty to help your fellow human beings?,\u201d he waves her off and heads out for an afternoon of picnicking and frisbee golf.\n\nEleanor and Michael quickly realize their issue: They\u2019ve never really known an unstressed Chidi. Figuring they can only motivate him through irritation (\u201cGotta get some sand in your clam,\u201d Eleanor says, misunderstanding how pearls are made), they bring Jason off the bench for the perfect pinch-hitting role. Replicating some of the conditions of the original experiment, they have Jason confess to Chidi that he\u2019s not really a Buddhist monk, forcing the ethicist to wrestle with whether his obligation is to be honest or to protect his new friend from eternal torture.\n\nThe funniest parts of \u201cChillaxing\u201d \u2014 which are too scant, frankly \u2014 involve the Odd Couple relationship between the freewheeling, impulse-driven Jason and the micromanaging Chidi, who scrambles to cover for the Jacksonville DJ\u2019s \u201cbud hole\u201d lifestyle. The breaking point for our man comes during a Neighborhood luau, where the residents each throw a magic lava stone into a bonfire and receive their truest desire. For Jason, this turns out to be a vehicle he accurately describes as \u201cthe Pam Anderson boob-motorcycle\u201d \u2014 which an embarrassed Chidi then has to claim as his own, lest his \u201cmonk\u201d pal be exposed. Defeated, Chidi slumps into the Architect\u2019s office to confess everything, at which point Eleanor realizes she\u2019s been having too much fun torturing the guy she loves, and bursts into tears. (\u201cOh no, I made God cry,\u201d Chidi laments.)\n\nThis storyline has the desired effect of getting Chidi into gear. By the end of the episode, with a little encouragement from Michael, his spirits are lifted just enough for him to resume his ethics class. But what\u2019s most fun about these scenes is they give Jason a chance to be a hilarious Florida dirtbag again. (He even gets to throw his magic lava stone like a molotov cocktail!) The episode\u2019s funniest moment comes when Chidi lies and says he\u2019s upset about his new motorcycle, which \u2014 in a quick cutaway shot \u2014 Michael immediately explodes, prompting Jason to whine, \u201cAw, not again.\u201d That\u2019s some good Good Place right there.\n\nSimilarly, the best bits of the John storyline let Tahani be Tahani. While trying to befriend the gossip columnist who used to torment her, she determines that a man who once searched the web for \u201csomething called a \u2018discount hotel package\u2019\u201d might appreciate the chance to live the insider\u2019s life she knew so well on Earth. With Janet\u2019s help, they have the ultimate \u201cspa day.\u201d They get treatments at a replica of Victoria Beckham\u2019s private \u201cPosh Wash.\u201d They take the private Louvre tour where they get to touch the art. They even \u201crode Aquamens through the water.\u201d Throughout, though, John remains catty, showing no remorse for how mean he was to the cool crowd when he was alive.\n\nTahini\u2019s first impulse to get John to see the error of his ways is to \u201cgo on the attack, just like six of the eight Game of Thrones characters who are based on me would do.\u201d But this just makes John snippier and more defensive. So instead she opens up about her own insecurities and status obsession, saying that her way of life left her \u201cjealous and miserable with no real friends.\u201d Finally, he starts to soften.\n\nAside from some primo Tahani name-dropping, this subplot is pretty pat, feeling at time more like a Saved by the Bell episode than a Good Place. (This week: Jessie and Kelly fake a fight to convince Lisa that gossiping is wrong!) Still, it\u2019s encouraging that at the end of this chapter, Tahani resists putting John in Chidi\u2019s ethics class, saying that human connection will be better for him than academic theory. That\u2019s a genuinely new direction for these characters; and even though it\u2019s early in the season, just about anything new is good. Three weeks into its final year, The Good Place has effectively reestablished its premise, its characters, and its setting. Now it\u2019s time to bring in a little chaos.\n\nIn The Neighborhood\n\n\u2022 Jameela Jamil had kind of a rough week, with the social media outcry over her defense (and then her defense of her defense, and then her retraction of her original defense but her continuing defense of her defense of her defense) of the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W. Bush. That whole brouhaha may cast Tahani\u2019s efforts at magnanimously extending privilege to the unprivileged in a different light for some viewers. It shouldn\u2019t. But it may.\n\n\u2022 Apparently the Good Place is populated by ants who improve picnics by helping with the clean up and supplying bottles of champagne. All hail the magic ants!\n\n\u2022 Subject lines of John\u2019s blog posts about supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid include, \u201cEat, Pray, Barf,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve Hadid Up To Here\u201d and \u201cOh No She Hadidn\u2019t! Gigi Ruins Bali Wedding By Being There!\u201d\n\n\u2022 Janet is attempting to recover from her breakup with Jason by following the internet\u2019s rebound suggestions. So far she\u2019s put streaks of color in her hair and watched Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again. Of the latter, she says, \u201cIt was okay. It\u2019s just a lot of the same songs as the first one.\u201d A fair criticism!", "description": "Tahani deals with her John problem, while the rest of the gang handles  an unexpected complication: Chidi.
