The singer had been battling pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe artist\u2019s youngest daughter Sarita Sosa thanked Miamians for embracing her dad when he first arrived decades ago, saying he was brought back to life in Florida.\n\n\u201cMay his music never die, please,\u201d she said, holding back tears. \u201cThank you for coming. You are our family. All of Miami, thank you.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 rose to stardom in 1970 with his hit \u201cEl Triste\u201d or \u201cThe Sad One,\u201d and became well-known across Latin America in the 1980s with his best-selling album \u201cSecrets,\u201d a collaboration with Spanish composer and producer Manuel Alejandro.\n\nBut the Mexican singer struggled with substance abuse and depression. Following the 1993 separation from Mexican model Anel Nore\u00f1a, he began sleeping in a taxi on the outskirts of the Mexican capital before friends intervened and took him to an addiction treatment center in the U.S.\n\nThe artist remarried in 1995 to a Cuban-American woman named Sarita Salazar, and the couple had Sarita Sosa the following year.\n\nIn a brief private ceremony broadcast by Univision before the public wake, Salazar was seen on stage next to the golden coffin, which was covered by a giant arrangement of white hydrangeas. A group of Mariachi performers dressed in white and played some of the artist\u2019s melodies such as \u201cThe Sad One\u201d and \u201cPillow,\u201d and fans got up from their seats to sing along.\n\n\u201cHe was born in Mexico, but we were lucky to have Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 living here,\u201d said Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez. Some of the Miami fans even tell stories of seeing the well-dressed singer at the supermarket or local pharmacies. He \u201cnever allowed fame to change who he was,\u201d Gimenez said.\n\nThe gifted singer- a combination of baritone and lyric tenor- was revered for his wide registry and ability to sustain long notes. He charmed audiences with his elegant suits accented with bow ties, pocket handkerchiefs and silk scarves and for his romantic interpretations of ballads such as \u201cHawk or Dove\u201d and \u201cLove and Want.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 was nominated on multiple occasions for a Grammy, but never received that accolade. The Latin Recording Academy recognized the singer with a Musical Excellence Prize at the 2004 Latin Grammy awards. That same year, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAs he got older, Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9\u2019s vocals began to fail him. For a 2008 concert with Greek composer and pianist Yanni, it took him seven days to prepare \u201cjust to attempt to sing,\u201d Yanni recounted.\n\nEven as the singer\u2019s voice got scratchy, ardent followers turned out to see him as recently as 2017 for concerts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. For the public funeral, fans with Mexican, Colombian, Argentine and other Latino origins traveled from New Jersey and other cities around Florida to honor him.\n\nAnotoria Vinas, an 80-year-old Dominican woman, said she ironed the artist\u2019s shirts when he began his career in Miami decades ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad, like his song goes,\u201d the woman said as she left the wake. \u201cIt hurts to see that he left this world, and how much he suffered before he did.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Miami, the second home to legendary Mexican crooner Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9, mourned the iconic artist on Sunday by gathering several hundreds of his fans at a closed casket wake with his family.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gisela Salomon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/jose_jose_funeral_16032_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
