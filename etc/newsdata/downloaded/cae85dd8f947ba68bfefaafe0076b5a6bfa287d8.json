Thanks to Lisa Elridge\u2019s recommendations, I bought the Eyeko Brow Gel and my whole makeup routine felt revolutionised \u2014 suddenly my whole face looked so much more polished and refined, yet natural. Despite my lackluster makeup skills, it was easy to apply \u2014 I first filled in my brows with a grey/taupe powder using an angled brush, though true to my then-haphazard ways, I just used an eyeshadow rather than any specialist brow product, followed by a few swipes of the gel. It made me look like an adult with naturally defined brows, and not a teen with reddish kohl conspicuously drawn onto her eyebrows. Previously I\u2019d used a dark-brown eye pencil (yes, an eye pencil, a kohl eyeliner, not even a brow pencil \u2014 forgive me please, we knew not what we were doing back then) which made my eyebrows look suspiciously gingery.\n\nI was so proud of the result that I took a picture and posted it on my Tumblr, as you do when you\u2019re a 19-year-old student with way too much time on your hands. It was reblogged over 200k times by \u2018aesthetic\u2019 blogs and hashtagged as \u2018eyebrow goals\u2019 so many times that for a while, if you googled \u2018eyebrow goals,\u2019 my somewhat cross-eyed photo would come up. My theory as to why it took off is that it stood in contrast with the emerging hyper-done Instagram brows, and instead was an achievable, relatable, natural look. Little did they know, it was actually brow gel that made my (although naturally thick) quite sparse and light brows look so thick, define, and #aesthetic.\n\nSeven years later, I still use this brow gel, and I\u2019ve even gifted it to my mother \u2014 who\u2019s now made it a staple part of her Christmas list, so every year I replenish her supply like a brow-specific Santa. Since 2012, she\u2019s also managed to go from dark-brown hair to blonde, and the universal shade has worked for either colour \u2014 because the subtle pigment makes your natural brow colour just a shade or two darker, enough to make the hairs pop against some brow powder and look defined, but not enough to actually change the colour altogether (basically, you can\u2019t overdo it).\n\nFor me, it works best after I\u2019ve filled my eyebrows in with something else to give your eyebrows definition (at the moment I\u2019m using a brow pencil I bought from Miniso last time I was in Asia, but anything works as long as it\u2019s not too dark) and the gel gives the hairs definition and keeps them in place \u2014 the result is that your brows look multidimensional rather than drawn on and completely natural. Unlike other brow gels, the Eyeko one actually has a gel-like quality and some light shimmer in its sheer, universal shade \u2014 it\u2019s not a cream or paste like mascara. The shimmer and texture means brows look glossy, never crunchy.\n\nThe one drawback is that occasionally you may get a little too much product on your brush \u2014 when that happens, I will brush the excess on the tube, or if it\u2019s already in my brows, I\u2019ll brush the excess out using a clean spoolie. The packaging is great \u2014 the icon\n\nic Eyeko silver soft-plastic tube means you can squeeze every last drop of product out, and the tube itself is a generous size; I use this every day but only need to replenish my supply once a year.\n\nMy point is \u2014 if this gel was good enough to make me briefly Tumblr famous, it may do the same to you on Instagram, or TikTok, or LinkedIn, or whatever other social-media form you set your sights on.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
