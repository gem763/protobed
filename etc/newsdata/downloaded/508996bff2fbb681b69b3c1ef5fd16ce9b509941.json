Orchids inspire my style.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s crop of Fashion Week attendees ranges from actress Hari Nef in Maryam Nassir Zadeh to DJ Shaun Wright in \u201ca very old sweatshirt.\u201d Spotted outside shows like MNZ, Collina Strada, Barrag\u00e1n, and Sandy Liang, the people below \u2014 stylists, editors, writers, designers, and one lawyer \u2014 were all happy to tell photographer Liisa Jokinen about how their looks came together. Scroll down for the full batch.\n\nStarling Irving, 25, Freelance Writer and Photographer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI just came straight to the Collina Strada show from a lovely afternoon spent frolicking in the New York Botanical Gardens in the Bronx. I was in need of a dose of greenery. This two-piece set is vintage from Artists & Fleas, and the sweater vest was gifted to me from the wardrobe of one of my mother\u2019s friends. I\u2019ve been so thrilled to see a larger focus on sustainability this fashion week. It\u2019s made me feel very hopeful about the future of the industry.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @starlingirving\n\nDraven Pena, 22, Student\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a tie-dye mesh dress, platform Tevas, and knot bag I made myself. I\u2019m most inspired by my Brazilian heritage and Afro-futurism. My philosophy: Dress how you want, when you want, and for whom you want.\u201d Instagram: @draveshades\n\nHilary George-Parkin, 29, Freelance Journalist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Jonathan Saunders jacket, an LPA skirt, an Aritzia tank, AGL shoes, Comme Si socks, a vintage bag, and a dollar-store headband. People who dress without inhibitions inspire my style. My style philosophy is to have fun, wear color, shop vintage.\u201d\n\nInstagram:@hilarygp\n\nBrianne Kim, 23, Production in Trims and Ribbons\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cMy top and skirt are Issey Miyake Pleats Please, my shoes are vintage Prada, and the bag is Marni. I\u2019m inspired by Japanese culture. My style philosophy is: Asian culture and designers combined with the rest of the world\u2019s designers can rule the world.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @bribribrichan\n\nJoe Van O, 23, Fashion Editor and Stylist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cToday I wore a T-shirt by Foo and Foo under a knit harness from Eckhaus Latta with vintage pants by Escalator. My style is inspired by handsome warriors, soft gestures, and low-hanging fruits.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @joe.van.o\n\nWhitney Bauck, 26, Associate Editor at Fashionista\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Veja sneakers, Eckhaus Latta socks, a Jungmaven naturally dyed hemp tee, a Petit Kouraj bag, and Svnr dress and earrings. My style is inspired by my drive to participate in the fashion industry in a way that pushes us to more socially and environmentally responsible practices.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @unwrinkling\n\nKacy Hill, 25, Singer/Songwriter\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Barrag\u00e1n crop top with vintage cargo pants and JJJJound Reeboks. I\u2019m inspired by color and comfort and confidence.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @kacyhill\n\nShaun J. Wright, 37, DJ\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI am wearing a very old sweatshirt, vintage shorts, Random Identities shoes and necklace, and a mudcloth-and-PVC kufi hat. I\u2019m inspired by modern street wear and traditional West African garments.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @shaunjwright\n\nSonia Stagg, 33, Sales Director at Maryam Nassir Zadeh\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Maryam Nassir Zadeh boots, jacket, and necklace, Cach\u00e9 skirt, and Ralph Lauren top. My designer clients inspire my style.\u201d\n\nSean Santiago, 31, Art Director\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Ferragamo jeans, 6397 shirt, and a Leo et Violette bag. Celebrities at the airport are my style inspiration. My style philosophy: Imagine a young Shelley Duvall in Rachel Comey.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @sean_santiago\n\nHari Nef, 26, Actress\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Maryam Nassir Zadeh, Saint Laurent shoes, and a Kara bag. I wanted to support Maryam today. I have been a fan of hers for a long time and got invited to the show and she gave me this beautiful dress. I have never worn anything quite like this, the color and the playfulness. I feel really cool in it and I really like the idea of being a clown. NYFW is kind of full of clowns so I am a clown now, too!\u201d\n\nInstagram: @harinef\n\nPaige Rubin, 28, Head Luxury Buyer at What Goes Around Comes Around\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cMy top and cardigan are Sandy Liang. The rest are vintage pieces from the store that I buy for. Traveling for work, I see a lot of great style in very different places. I think everywhere I go I bring a little something back with me, whether it\u2019s a new piece of clothing or a different way to wear an old one. The only trick to pulling off a crazy outfit is just believing you are.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @paigerubin\n\nNaura M. Keiser, 36, Lawyer and Collector\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a vintage Mary McFadden pleated set from eBay, a thrifted handbag, and Converse sneakers. I suppose the displeasure (or, at a minimum, boredom) I feel at looking at my unclothed body and unpainted face when I wake is inspiration enough to take action \u2014 that is to say, to hurl a bunch of color/pattern/texture/shine at the \u2018problem.\u2019 I recognize that my self-deprecation doesn\u2019t change the fact that I am citing MYSELF as my inspiration. My style philosophy: Acquire and wear clothes that you can imagine yourself wearing as a 70-year-old, or that you wish you had when you were half your age. A \u2018timeless\u2019 wardrobe is within reach, even for the maximalists among us.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @walk_of_dame\n\nAlexandra Mondalek, 25, Freelance Writer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cMy style inspiration is imagining a Roy Lichtenstein girl IRL. My style philosophy: Opposing colors are good, all black is great, reimagining what you own is best.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @hautetakes\n\nMarino Murata, 22, Student and Graphic Designer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing The End Lingerie, a \u201970s suit found at Worship Vintage, and Malin Landaeus Select Vintage Collection boots. I\u2019m inspired usually by my mood.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @m.a.r.i.n.o\n\nEmily Dawn Long, 29, Stylist and Designer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Bode top, an antique table cloth I turned into a skirt, and vintage boots. The bag is by me. Textiles and fits inspire my style. They don\u2019t make it like they used to \u2014 vintage is a way of life. I dress organically to my mood and I approach each outfit as if one would approach a sculpture. It\u2019s about the shape and textile of the garment.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @emilydawnlong\n\nEugene Choi, 26, Artist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Telfar cap, Telfar shirt, Haus of Hellmutti dress, Redback boots, and a Carhartt bag. My friends inspire me the most in everything.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @girlboy", "description": "Liisa Jokinen shoots New Yorkers with fearless personal style at her site NYC-Looks.
