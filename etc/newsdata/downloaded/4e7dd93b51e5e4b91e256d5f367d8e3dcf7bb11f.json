I remember travelling out one evening with Charlotte, my wife, and we were trying to coax him to come. So we went to his house and we sat down.\n\nMilner once again proved he is the man for the big occasion with his goal on Saturday\n\n\u2018Charlotte did the work on his wife, telling her what a great club Liverpool is and how it is an incredible place to come. And I went to work on James\u2026 It\u2019s really, really interesting because he wanted to come to Liverpool. He had won the Premier League, he had won cups.\n\n\u2018His whole ambition was to win the Champions League and he felt he\u2019d have a better opportunity to win it at Liverpool, with how we were working and the (history of the) club. He made the decision. I knew it was going to be a tough one. He was building a house out that way in Manchester.\n\n\u2018When we got the call to say he was going to come, I was so, so happy. His professionalism, his intensity, his focus. It was always going to help the squad. Even though it was only a short time we worked together, he was always going to be a really good signing. He is just a top class professional.\u2019\n\nBrendan Rodgers also explained how he ended up bringing the 33-year-old to Anfield\n\nIt was noticeable at the final whistle that Rodgers put his disappointment at losing in such a manner to one side and made a beeline for Milner and Jordan Henderson to give the both a hug; he was well-regarded and respected by both midfielders at Anfield and the feeling was mutual.\n\n\u2018I always try to do my best for the players \u2013 the likes of him, Jordan,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018When they lifted the European Cup last year, to see their joy and their happiness. It was absolutely brilliant. They are good guys and you are playing here under big pressure.\n\n\u2018They are absolutely key for the whole spirit of Liverpool. They bring that intensity and focus and they are good guys.\u2019", "description": "James Milner proved himself to be the man for the big occasion once again as Liverpool consolidated their position at the top of table.
