Beijing does not want anything to mar the holiday, but the Hong Kong protesters seem determined to do just that.\n\nThe first event on Saturday was a citywide \u201ccleanup\u201d led by Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who is among the government\u2019s most vocal defenders. He visited several districts of Hong Kong holding a broom and a dust pan, and theatrically tidied the sidewalks as television cameras rolled.", "description": "The violence near Hong Kong\u2019s border with the Chinese mainland came less than two weeks before a sensitive political anniversary.", "authors": ["Mike Ives", "Elaine Yu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/21/world/21hongkong2/21hongkong2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
