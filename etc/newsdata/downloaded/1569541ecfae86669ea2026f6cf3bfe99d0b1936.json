Among other problems with the story was the fact that Keyser had only gone on a date or two with Kavanaugh\u2019s friend Mark Judge, and the party she recalled attending with him was very different from the one Ford described. Keyser told the authors that she spent 70 hours a week that summer in question working and practicing golf after her shift ended at the Congressional Country Club. Ford says she was at a different country club prior to the early-evening party where the alleged assault occurred, but Keyser only recalled helping Ford practice diving at that country club early in the morning.\n\nIn Ford\u2019s telling, on the night of the alleged assault, she, Keyser, and Kavanaugh\u2019s friend P. J. Smyth each had precisely one beer at the alleged party, while Kavanaugh and Judge, whom Ford alleges was a witness to the alleged assault, were so extremely inebriated at an early evening \u201cpre-gathering\u201d that Kavanaugh and Judge were \u201cpinballing off the walls.\u201d Yet Keyser insists she has no recollection of ever meeting Kavanaugh.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Nationalreview.Com Brett-Kavanaugh-Confirmation-What-Weve-Learned-One-Year-Later"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
