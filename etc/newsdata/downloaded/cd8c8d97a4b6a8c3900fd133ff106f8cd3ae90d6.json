In value terms, August\u2019s imports fell 62% to $1.37 billion, the lowest since August 2016.\n\nOn Wednesday, local gold futures hit an all-time high of 39,770 Indian rupees ($556.29) per 10 grams, taking their gains to more than 26% in 2019.\n\nRetail demand has been subdued for the past few weeks due to the price rise, said Ashok Jain, proprietor of Mumbai-based gold wholesaler Chenaji Narsinghji.\n\n\u201cA few consumers are selling gold. Scrap supplies have risen substantially,\u201d he said.\n\nIndia\u2019s gold demand is likely to soften in the September quarter as record high local prices curtails buying, the World Gold Council said last month.\n\nIn August, dealers were offering a discount of up to $37 an ounce from official domestic prices, the biggest since August 2016. The domestic price includes a 12.5% import tax and 3% sales tax.\n\n\u201cLegal imports are falling due to smuggling. The price rise and duty hike has been increasing smuggling,\u201d said a Mumbai-based dealer with a bullion importing bank.\n\nNew Delhi raised an import tax on gold by 2.5 percentage points to 12.5% in July\u2019s federal budget, effectively increasing smugglers\u2019 margins.\n\nIndian customs officials seized 1,197.7 kg of smuggled gold in the April-June quarter, up 23% from a year ago, a government official said on Monday.\n\nIndia\u2019s gold imports in September could be less than 35 tonnes, down from last year\u2019s 81.71 tonnes, the dealer said.\n\n($1 = 71.4920 Indian rupees)", "description": "India's gold imports plunged 73% in August from a year ago to the lowest level in three years as a rally in local prices to a record high and a hike in import duty discouraged retail buying, a government source said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Aftab Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426050191&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830AP"}
