Although police have yet to complete their investigation, they plan to present to the City Council an update on what they\u2019ve learned, offering new details on the shooter and his work history as well as how the killings unfolded.\n\nThe shooter, DeWayne Craddock, had worked for nine years as a city engineer before emailing an unremarkable resignation letter to his bosses at 10:31 a.m. May 31, a Friday. One of them accepted it 15 minutes later, according to an unredacted email obtained by The Washington Post, informing Craddock when his last day would be. Less than six hours later, as the workweek neared its end, Craddock returned with a pair of .45-caliber handguns, at least one equipped with a sound suppressor and extended magazine.\n\nHe first killed a contractor in the parking lot outside Building 2 of the sprawling Virginia Beach municipal complex, a cluster of government offices just east of a golf course. He then fatally shot a woman on her way out and used his government badge to access the building\u2019s second floor, where he killed 10 more people and wounded four others. Within minutes, authorities said, Craddock died in a shootout with police.\n\nTwo days after the shootings, city manager Dave Hansen, who has since resigned, announced that \u201ca very thorough review\u201d of the gunman\u2019s personnel file had revealed no problems.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, the perpetrator\u2019s performance was satisfactory,\u201d Hansen said, adding that the 40-year-old Craddock \u201cwas in good standing within his department \u2026 there were no issues of discipline ongoing.\u201d\n\n[\u2018He wants this so bad\u2019: A widower\u2019s quest for answers in Virginia Beach takes its toll]\n\nThose statements angered some relatives of the victims, including Jason Nixon, who said that his wife, Kate, had \u201cwritten up\u201d the gunman for poor performance. Another time, Kate \u2014 a compliance manager in the public utilities department \u2014 had complained that Craddock was a chauvinist, disrespecting her because she was a woman who outranked him, her husband said.\n\n\u201cI want answers,\u201d Nixon said Monday, adding that families had not been told what police would reveal. \u201cThey won\u2019t say. It\u2019s like a big surprise. I\u2019m thinking they are going to drop some bombs.\u201d\n\nCity Council member John Moss said he and his colleagues were offered an advance look at the police report about a week ago. Some took the offer, though he declined. Like Nixon, Moss and several other council members reached by The Post said they had not been briefed on what the police would announce Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be learning about it at the same time as the families of victims,\u201d Michael Berlucchi said. \u201cI\u2019m for transparency. I think it\u2019s critically important that we know what happened. And I think this presentation is one important step.\u201d\n\nHillard Heintze, a Chicago-based firm hired by the city to conduct an investigation, also will deliver a progress report Tuesday on its work but won\u2019t release findings.\n\nNixon and his family plan to watch the police presentation from a private location where the city will provide grief counselors.\n\nFor families who wish to see where their loved ones died, police have agreed to escort them to Building 2 on Tuesday. Nixon, among those to call for the building to be demolished, said he intends to visit his wife\u2019s office, where he would often stop by to take her to lunch.\n\n\u201cI want to see her room,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite Tuesday\u2019s efforts at transparency, Nixon said he was still skeptical of the city\u2019s investigation into the mass shooting.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for.\u201d\n\nDebbie Borato, whose her sister Missy Langer was a victim, was angry that the city told families about the briefing less than two weeks ago. Borato, who lives in Florida, said she\u2019s cutting short a vacation to fly to Virginia Beach, although she added that the city had offered to reimburse her and others for their flights.\n\nShe wants to put up a small plaque honoring her sister at the spot on the stairway where Missy was killed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll let me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to tear that building down, I want that plaque there.\u201d\n\nPat Gallagher, who lost his wife, Tara Gallagher, in the shooting, wasn\u2019t sure whether he would attend the public session or the private gathering for families but doubted he would take any tours of the municipal complex.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any benefit in going. It\u2019s going to look different, they\u2019ve renovated it,\u201d said Gallagher, whose wife, 39, worked as an engineer. \u201cI honestly think the city is only doing all of this because a couple other families have come out and said the city hasn\u2019t been keeping them in the loop.\u201d\n\nGallagher, 49, an architect with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command in Norfolk, said he doesn\u2019t know what investigators might reveal, but hopes the city discloses the gunman\u2019s emails and employment records soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t be released, especially if it\u2019s relevant to the investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re holding back on things and when you hold back on things, it does nothing other than fuel the fire for conspiracy theories. You\u2019d be out of your mind to say [his records] shouldn\u2019t be released. I am a little frustrated by the lack of transparency.\u201d\n\nSince the shooting, Gallagher said he thinks of his wife every day, as he\u2019s now on his own to raise their toddler, Patrick, who recently turned 2.\n\n\u201cThe house hasn\u2019t changed since she left,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is the same.\u201d\n\nExcept, of course, that nothing is the same.\n\nPatricia Sullivan contributed to this report", "description": "Families of the 12 people killed await new information on the shooter and his work history.", "authors": ["Michael E.
