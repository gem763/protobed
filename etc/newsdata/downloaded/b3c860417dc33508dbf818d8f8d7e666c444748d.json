GVD/EUR\n\n\"A perceived lull in U.S.-China trade tensions has eased market fears about an economic downturn,\" a group of BlackRock's investment strategists wrote in a note.\n\nCurrency market moves were mostly small-scale, with one notable exception - the pound.\n\nTraders had waited for a Supreme Court ruling on UK Prime Minister's Boris Johnson five-week suspension of parliament -- a move known as prorogation in Westminster speak -- and when it came it was unanimous and blunt. The move was \"unlawful\". initially climbed as high $1.2487 GBP=D4 on the view it would help prevent the UK being bundled towards a 'no-deal' Brexit at the end of October. It then lost traction though and spent the next few hours bobbing between $1.2480 and $1.2460.\n\n\"I wasn't surprised to see it hop higher but I also wasn't surprised to see cable (pound vs the dollar) run out of steam ahead of $1.25,\" said TD Securities' European head of currency strategy Ned Rumpeltin.\n\nJohnson is now likely to head to his Conservative party's annual conference at the weekend and rally his troops in preparation for a likely national election which will be a bitter fight over Brexit.\n\n\"He is going to have to rally his base and he is going to do that around hard Brexit,\" Rumpeltin said. \"That will be a moment of clarity for the FX market... It will look at the polling and the Conservatives are leading in the polls.\"\n\nGOOD TO TALK\n\nWhile trade talks remained the primary focus, U.S. investors were also waiting on closely-followed consumer confidence data due at 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) which is expected to remain robust.\n\nMonday has seen a mixed batch of U.S. economic surveys but still S&P 500 had remained within striking distance of its July all-time high. .N\n\nOvernight, MSCI's broadest regional Asia share index inched up 0.1%, led by 0.6% gains in mainland Chinese shares after the vice head of China's state planner said Beijing will step up efforts to stabilise growth.
