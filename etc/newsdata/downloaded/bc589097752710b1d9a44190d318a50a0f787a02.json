He's a different type of defender as well,\" Cheika said.\n\n\"He's done well in the (bench) opportunities he's been given there, admittedly in second halves, when we've had a bit more of a direct line to what we're doing.\n\n\"We'll try and start like that now so we're giving him the opportunity to show his wares there.\"\n\nNic White has been retained at halfback, meaning the halves combination used frequently at the Brumbies from 2011-15 will be reunited.\n\nHowever, Cheika said nothing should be assumed about the quarter-finals, even if To'omua stars against the Georgians.\n\n\"I don't think Christian's done anything particularly deserving (to be dropped). We're just taking a look mate,\" he said.\n\n\"Matt's got a job to do for this weekend and after this weekend we'll sit down and assess all the options.\"\n\nCheika also rejected a suggestion Lealiifano's demotion was due to the leukaemia survivor having his workload managed carefully at the tournament.\n\nWhile Cheika confirmed there were contingencies around how the 32-year-old was managed, he noted he came through 80 minutes in Saturday's win over Uruguay with no issues.\n\n\"Yes, I get the whole managed load and all that stuff but if he's on the field playing good, I'm leaving him out there,\" Cheika said.\n\n\"Like any player, he has an individual plan that he'll follow but he's certainly not looking for anything. He's not asking 'Oh, I need to do this'.\"", "description": "Michael Cheika insists Matt To'omua is no guarantee to wear the Wallabies No.10 jersey in the Rugby World Cup knockout phase, even if he pounces on his rare...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
