The Swiss government had sought to safeguard its bilateral trade by seeking legal clarity from the Treasury Department on behalf of Swiss banks. But the National Security Council, then led by John Bolton, blocked its operationalization despite support for the channel within the State Department.\n\nThe new announcement expands the scope of the channel to include any American or foreign financial institution engaged in humanitarian trade with Iran. This expanded scope and the timing of the move likely reflect concerns over the impact to humanitarian trade resulting from the Trump administration\u2019s move to designate Iran\u2019s central bank under a terrorism authority. That sanctions designation eliminated a long-standing exemption permitting a role for CBI in trade in food and medicine.\n\nOver the last few weeks, European multinationals involved in the sale of humanitarian goods to Iran have been scrambling to understand the impact of the new designation on CBI. The Treasury Department failed to issue guidance in the aftermath of the designation to inform changes to compliance policies.\n\nIn particular, European companies engaged in the sale of food and pharmaceuticals were unclear as to whether the reliance of their customers on foreign currency allocations made by the Central Bank of Iran constitutes exposure to the new designation. Bourse & Bazaar contacted treasury managers and compliance officers at six European multinational companies in the days following the designation of the central bank. All refused to provide comment, but confirmed that the new sanctions had triggered internal reviews.\n\nThe move to finally launch the humanitarian channel appears to be an attempt to manage the unintended consequences of CBI\u2019s terrorism designation. Over the last few weeks, European officials raised concerns with American counterparts about the impact of humanitarian trade. Speaking on background, a European official confirmed to Bourse & Bazaar that U.S. officials had described the launch of the humanitarian channel as a way to assuage those concerns.\n\nUnder the new framework, financial institutions which accept payments related to the sale of food and medicine to Iran will be permitted to \u201cseek written confirmation from Treasury that the proposed financial channel will not be exposed to U.S. sanctions.\u201d For years, European banks have sought \u201ccomfort letters\u201d from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for humanitarian trade. It has been OFAC policy not to provide such letters and humanitarian transactions are not eligible for the licensing process due to the exempt nature of the trade. In this regard, the new framework represents a significant shift in policy.\n\nBut the new framework may introduce more problems than it solves. In order to receive such comfort letters, the financial institutions must undertake an enhanced due diligence process, reporting to Treasury \u201ca great deal of information on a monthly basis.\u201d The due diligence requirements go far beyond what has been considered the industry standard process for companies engaged in trade with Iran. Considering the significant costs and administrative burdens of such reporting, the requirement will likely limit the uptake of the new framework to those financial institutions engaged in the greatest volume of humanitarian trade with Iran.\n\nThe reporting requirements will also raise concerns among Iranian banks. Among the information requested by the Treasury Department are the \u201cmonthly statement balances with the value, currency, and balance date of any account of an Iranian financial institution\u201d held at the foreign bank and used for humanitarian trade.\n\nConcurrently with its announcement of the new channel, the Treasury Department identified Iran as \u201ca jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act.\u201d As Tyler Cullis warned in Bourse & Bazaar in July, this move could independently have a devastating impact on humanitarian trade:\n\nUnder the proposed rule, US banks would be required to undertake \u201cspecial due diligence\u201d with respect to correspondent accounts maintained on behalf of foreign financial institutions. Such \u201cspecial due diligence\u201d does not require that US banks close the accounts of foreign banks that themselves maintain accounts for Iranian banks so long as such banks do not permit Iran indirect access to the US correspondent account. But US banks are unlikely to narrowly tailor their conduct to the precise nuances of law and will show reluctance to continue banking foreign correspondents that themselves bank Iran. As a result, European banks that maintain accounts on behalf of Iranian financial institutions are likely to take steps to shutter such accounts so as to sustain their own accounts at US banks.\n\nIt is unclear whether companies can opt not to seek comfort letters through the new framework. Some financial institutions may prefer to maintain trade without the additional legal clarity as they have done since the reimposition of secondary sanctions last year, relying on the existing general licenses issued by the Treasury Department to permit humanitarian trade.\n\nBut the Treasury Department\u2019s pursuit of \u201cunprecedented transparency into humanitarian trade\u201d and its allegations of Iran\u2019s use of \u201cso-called humanitarian trade to evade sanctions and fund its malign activity,\u201d may see Trump administration officials pressure companies to use the new framework, requiring disclosures of sensitive financial information that will be unacceptable to Iranian banks and companies wary of U.S. intentions. The Trump administration\u2019s latest gesture to ease humanitarian trade may end up doing just the opposite.\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s announcement may be intended to pre-empt next week\u2019s launch of a major report from Human Rights Watch that is expected to show significant failures on the part of the United States to safeguard humanitarian trade in accordance with its own sanctions policies. The administration continues to claim that its \u201cunprecedented economic pressure\u201d is \u201cnot directed at the people of Iran.\u201d\n\nPhoto: IRNA", "description": "\u25e2 The Treasury Department has announced that it will operationalize a \r\nfinancial channel to facilitate humanitarian trade with Iran, after \r\nprivately acknowledging to European officials that recent sanctions imposed \r\non the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) risked encumbering trade in food and \r\nmedicine.
