Reminder: There are 130 days until the Iowa caucuses and 404 days until the 2020 election.\n\nWhile the political world was transfixed, understandably, by the building drama of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, significant news was also being made on the campaign trail.\n\nIt looks like the Democratic primary contest has a new frontrunner. Or a co-frontrunner, to be exact.\n\nIn terms of polling, the story of the summer was how Elizabeth Warren started out in late April around 7 percent, still reeling from her stumble in handling questions about her claims to Native American ancestry, then slowly but surely gained support until she broke away from the pack and joined Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the top tier. Look back at a graph of the national numbers over that period; Warren is the only major candidate whose line goes up, overall, rather than down.\n\nBut the last 72 hours have seen Warren breaking away from Sanders too \u2014 and even surpassing Biden where it matters most.\n\nSen.

Three national polls have come out since Tuesday: Quinnipiac, Emerson and the Economist. Two of them show Warren leading Biden for the first time, with 27 percent support to Biden\u2019s 26 percent (the Economist) or 25 percent (Quinnipiac); in both polls, Sanders trails at 16. Meanwhile, the third poll (Emerson) shows Biden leading Warren by a mere 2 points \u2014 a huge shift from Emerson\u2019s late August poll, which had Biden ahead of Warren by 16 points.\n\nOn average, Biden still leads nationally by more than 7 percentage points. But that is his smallest advantage to date, and it could shrink further if additional surveys confirm Warren\u2019s momentum. As for Sanders, Warren\u2019s average lead over the Vermont senator \u2014 4.1 percentage points \u2014 is the largest it\u2019s ever been.\n\nWarren speaks at Washington Square Park in New York City on Sept. 16, 2019.

Three Iowa polls, the first since the start of September, were in the field last week. All three, including the gold-standard Des Moines Register poll, found Warren either beating Biden (by as much as 8 points) or statistically tied for first. She is now ahead of Biden in the Iowa polling average for the first time; Sanders trails with roughly half Warren\u2019s support.\n\nThe standings in New Hampshire are more muddled; Biden and Sanders have been trading the lead for much of the year. But the two newest polls, one by Monmouth University and one by Tel Opinion Research, show Warren zipping into first. Monmouth puts her at 27 percent to Biden\u2019s 25 percent and Sanders\u2019s 12 percent; Tel has her at 18 percent to Biden\u2019s 15 percent and Sanders\u2019s 8 percent.\n\nThen there\u2019s California to consider. As Super Tuesday\u2019s biggest delegate prize, it could help seal the nomination for whoever wins there on March 3 \u2014 and Warren seems to be pulling away. In June, the respected Los Angeles Times/Berkeley poll showed Warren trailing Biden by 4 points; now it shows her leading him by 9.", "description": "While the political world was transfixed by the building drama of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, significant news was also being made on the campaign trail.", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o8KaEOGWx1QnGVF20vUiIw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3084af10-dfd9-11e9-bfef-e90b1204eb3e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
