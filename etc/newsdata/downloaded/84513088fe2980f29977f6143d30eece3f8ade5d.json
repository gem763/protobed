Then, follow these steps:\n\n1. Unbox your Leesa Hybrid mattress on its side, next to the foundation or floor. Avoid using a sharp object to open the box as you run the risk of unintentionally slicing your Leesa Hybrid. Unboxing by yourself? Try placing your foot on one of the flaps to hold it in place while you pull the bedroll out.\n\n2. Position your rolled up Leesa Hybrid on any solid or slatted foundation and remove the outer layer of plastic wrap. You'll notice that your Leesa Hybrid has already started to expand at this point\n\n3. Unwrap and unfold the mattress and tear away the inner plastic. If you tear the inner plastic at the top of the bed, you can pull it straight down and off like a sock.\n\n4. Watch your Leesa Hybrid expand and take shape. Note: It may take up to an hour for your Leesa Hybrid to fully expand and a few days to fully firm up. Any slight odor will dissipate shortly after setup.\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to resist giving your Leesa Hybrid mattress a quick test run. The top surface may feel soft at first but soon the memory foam will kick in and relieve the pressure on your body. The pocket springs will allow the entire mattress to contour to your body in a minute your mattress will feel great, later it will feel amazing.", "description": "Get your rest on with Leesa\u2019s hybrid mattress.
