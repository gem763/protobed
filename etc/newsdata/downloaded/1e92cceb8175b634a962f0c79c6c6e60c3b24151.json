Maybe ever.\n\nIt weighs 7.97 ounces, or half a pound.\n\nThe next heaviest phone I\u2019m aware of is Apple\u2019s own iPhone XS Max at 0.46 pounds.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus has a larger screen, a stylus, and an extra camera lens \u2013 and it weighs a full ounce less than the iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nMore people complain about iPhones being too big than their weight. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what people say about the iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2019s weight when the phones are released on September 20.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro Max has a 6.5-inch display, and it\u2019s a pretty big smartphone.\n\nIt also weighs 7.97 ounces \u2013 or half a pound.\n\nThat\u2019s not wildly heavy in relative terms. But comparatively, that makes the iPhone 11 Pro Max among the heaviest smartphones you can buy today. Maybe ever.\n\nHere are the weights of some of the biggest, heaviest smartphones I can think of in recent memory:\n\nGalaxy Note 10 Plus: 6.91 ounces / 0.43 pounds.\n\n6.91 ounces / 0.43 pounds. Galaxy S10 Plus: 6.17 ounces / 0.39 pounds.\n\n6.17 ounces / 0.39 pounds. iPhone XS Max: 7.34 ounces / 0.46 pounds.\n\n7.34 ounces / 0.46 pounds. OnePlus 7 Pro: 7.27 ounces / 0.45 pounds.\n\nI can\u2019t think of another recent smartphone, or any smartphone, that weighs as much as the iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus weighs less than the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and yet the Note has a larger display, glass everywhere, a stylus, and an extra camera lens. The Note 10 Plus also likely has a bigger battery, too. Apple doesn\u2019t list its iPhone batteries\u2019 capacities, but trusted specs site GSMArena says the iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2019s battery is 3,500mAh. If that\u2019s accurate, the iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2019s battery is almost 1,000mAH smaller than the Galaxy Note 10 Plus\u2019 4,300mAh battery.\n\nRead more: The most expensive iPhone Apple sells costs $1,450 \u2013 about the same as a 13-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nI asked Apple if there\u2019s any particular reason why the iPhone 11 Pro Max weighs half a pound while other bigger phones weigh less. The company hasn\u2019t replied yet.\n\nTo note, Apple\u2019s big-screened iPhones have been getting heavier over the last few years:\n\niPhone 7 Plus: 6.63 ounces / 0.41 pounds.\n\n6.63 ounces / 0.41 pounds. iPhone 8 Plus: 7.13 ounces / 0.45 pounds.\n\n7.13 ounces / 0.45 pounds. iPhone XS Max: 7.34 ounces / 0.46 pounds.\n\n7.34 ounces / 0.46 pounds. iPhone 11 Pro Max: 7.97 ounces / 0.50 pounds.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a massive outcry about the iPhone\u2019s weight gain over the last few iPhone generations. Some may even associate a heavier weight to better reliability or sturdiness.\n\nInstead, more people have complained about the overall size of Apple\u2019s iPhones, with many complaining that they\u2019ve been getting too big to use comfortably, especially when the company stopped offering the small iPhone SE.\n\nAt the end of the day, it all comes down to personal preference. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if people find the iPhone 11 Max Pro too heavy for their tastes when the new iPhones are released on September 20.\n\nNow tell us what you think!", "description": "Business Insider - Few have complained about the iPhone's weight gain over the last few years, but now that it's at the half-pound mark, people might start to notice..
