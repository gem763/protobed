Francis will be accompanied by England\u2019s QC Richard Smith with Jones in attendance for the marquee Pool D fixture instead. England are on the same side of the draw as Wales and Australia so Jones and his coaches will get a close-up view of their likely quarter-final opponents.\n\nEngland lie low in Kobe hills before \u2018big step up\u2019 against Argentina | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nArgentina are playing Tonga in Osaka on Saturday \u2013 only 20 miles from Kobe, where England are currently based \u2013 before Jones\u2019s side face the Pumas in a week. Jones, however, has given his squad the weekend off and said: \u201cI won\u2019t watch that game. I\u2019ll watch other games. Argentina have very much gone back to their 2007 game. [They are a] high-kicking team, which they hadn\u2019t been.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, has identified an emphasis on kicking across the tournament but none of Jones\u2019s staff are due to be in Osaka. \u201cYou look at the way teams attack and defend,\u201d he said. \u201cI am looking for space. I try to identify where there is space and come up with ideas of how I might manipulate that. There is a trend in the tournament. The accuracy of the kicking games. The better teams have better kick strategies.\u201d\n\nFrancis could be ruled out of the rest of the tournament after he was cited for the incident that occurred only seven seconds into Thursday\u2019s victory.\n\nHe is the fourth player cited at the World Cup following World Rugby\u2019s promised clampdown on high tackles and the governing body\u2019s public reprimand for its referees this week. Under World Rugby regulations, any sanctions that involve contact with the head warrant a mid-range entry point and therefore a minimum of six weeks. Australia\u2019s Reece Hodge and Samoa\u2019s Rey Lee-Lo were both handed six-week bans, reduced to three for mitigation. A three-week ban at the World Cup equates to three matches so Francis would not be able to play again until the semi-finals, were England to get that far.\n\nThe USA flanker John Quill, who was sent off for a sickening shoulder to Owen Farrell, was on Friday given a three-match ban. Wisemantel confirmed that Farrell has no delayed after-effects of the shoulder charge.\n\nMako Vunipola and Jack Nowell are both expected to be available to face Argentina after both came through training on Friday. With England also hopeful over Henry Slade, Jones was set to have a full complement of 31 players to select from against the Pumas, Francis\u2019s citing notwithstanding.", "description": "The England manager has revealed he will not watch his team\u2019s next World Cup opponents Argentina but plans to scout the potential quarter-final rivals", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcea8209c18559923c6e1f29614d4f1288006c05/0_26_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d92aeb71c6ca0b4243b786e8251f8d3b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
