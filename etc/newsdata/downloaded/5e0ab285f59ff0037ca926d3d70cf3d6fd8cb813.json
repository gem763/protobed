Crazy, right? People are obsessed with this programmable pressure cooker for making meal prep insanely easy, and saving them plenty of time in the kitchen. If you still don't own one but are interesting in joining the legion of Instant Pot owners around the world, now's your chance to do so, because the popular Instant Pot DUO80 just dropped to a super low price on Amazon.\n\nPeople love this trendy multi-cooker because it has the abilities of multiple kitchen appliances (including a rice cooker, steamer, and slow cooker), and can cook your food in a fraction of the time it would take on the stovetop or in the oven. Right now you can save $20 on the DUO80 8 Quart 7-in-1\u2014a size that's ideal for family dinners\u2014and get it for just $79.99, which is only $10 higher than its all-time-low price. With the holidays coming up in the next few months, this 8 Qt Instant Pot could be the perfect addition to your kitchen to cook a big meal quickly and feed all those hungry guests.\n\nWhile this particular model may drop to a lower price on Black Friday, we expect the Instant Pot to be a hot commodity, especially with the holidays coming up, so you may risk it selling out if you wait. Plus at this price, which is pretty crazy as it's the same price that the smaller 6-quart version currently costs, you're already getting a great deal as is.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
