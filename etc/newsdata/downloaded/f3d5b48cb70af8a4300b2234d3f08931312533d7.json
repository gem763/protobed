Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos is unlikely to go to jail, but the internet might have you think otherwise.\n\nThe furor online stems from a case involving the now-defunct Corinthian College, a for-profit college that closed in 2015. The U.S. Department of Education had been ordered to stop collecting on the federal loans of students who attended the school. But the departmentdisclosed it had continued to garnish wages and seize tax returns of hundreds of borrowers. Others had erroneously paid money toward the loans when they didn't have to.\n\nThe judge's order is part of a lawsuit by former students at Corinthian College, who are suing the department with the hope of discharging their student loans.\n\nColleges keep closing: Their students are left without degrees. How to keep it from happening to you\n\nSallie Kim, a federal magistrate judge in California, admonished the department on Monday during a hearing. Among her remarks, she said: \"I am not sending anyone to jail yet, but it\u2019s good to know that I have that ability.\u201d\n\nSome interpreted those remarks as though DeVos herself might be facing jail time. And several news outlets ran headlines linking DeVos to time behind bars.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos are both controversial, polarizing figures.

It's hard to see DeVos doing otherwise.\n\nIn fact, the judge has already given DeVos an out. In her Tuesday ruling, Kim asked both the Education Department and the former Corinthian students to submit responses to the possibility of a contempt order. She also asked them to give some ideas of how the department could \"remedy\" its illegal collection of student loan payments from the former students and ensure it didn't happen again.\n\nThe Education Department didn't immediately return a request for comment, but it had noted in previous court filings that it was aware of its error. The department wrote it was letting borrowers know about the error and issuing refunds.\n\nDuring her tenure as President Donald Trump's education secretary, DeVos has always attracted fierce controversy. She has become especially reviled by critics on the left for her support of school choice and for rolling back federal regulations in higher education.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/10/08/betsy-devos-jail-sallie-kim-department-of-education-corinthian-college/3912609002/", "description": "A judge said to Betsy DeVos' department: \"I am not sending anyone to jail yet, but it\u2019s good to know that I have that ability.\u201d\u00a0The internet exploded.", "authors": ["Chris Quintana", "Published P.M.
