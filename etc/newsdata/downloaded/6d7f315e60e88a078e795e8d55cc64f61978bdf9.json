The report also states then-NRA Vice President Pete Brownell had a trip to Russia for potential personal business opportunities partially covered by the NRA.\n\n\"This report promotes a politically motivated and contrived narrative. An avalanche of proof confirms that the NRA, as an organization, was never involved in the activities about which the Democrats write,\" counsel to the NRA William Brewer III said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"This report goes to great lengths to try to involve the NRA in activities of private individuals and create the false impression that the NRA did not act appropriately. Nothing could be further from the truth. As noted by the committee Republicans in their rebuttal, this report is a transparent effort to justify yet another \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 into the NRA,\" he added.\n\nIn regards to the trip, NRA Managing Director of Public Affairs Andrew Arulanandam said some members made \"the trip of their own accord,\" pointing to how \"the record reflects it was not an official NRA trip. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre was opposed to it and, at his directive, no NRA staff members or employees attended.\"", "description": ".09/27/2019 20:57:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/71/5a51771e-17fe-497a-8d50-df5d97d5e8b2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
