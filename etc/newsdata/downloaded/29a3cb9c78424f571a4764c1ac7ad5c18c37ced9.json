For all their expertise in cutting-edge technology, these innovators have not demonstrated even a rudimentary understanding of the lives of the poor: Tech entrepreneurs usually start with a cool technology and only afterward make claims about helping the marginalized, rather than collecting data about what these communities really need and meeting those needs. The unbanked and underbanked are often stuck in a cash economy, do not have Internet access or rely on brick-and-mortar establishments to convert cash into digital. Facebook has no physical locations \u2014 certainly none in America\u2019s banking deserts. Most of the unbanked or underbanked either do not have enough money for a bank account, do not trust banks or prefer the informal face-to-face transactions that check cashers can provide at all hours. The preferred method of payment for low-income Americans is a debit card \u2014 an old technology that nevertheless remains inaccessible for many.\n\nThe blockchain ledger may represent a big technological leap forward, but our financial system\u2019s problems with exclusion and inefficiency don\u2019t result from faulty technology. Our current payments system already can provide services to the underbanked and fulfill Libra\u2019s promise to allow users to send money as fast as one sends a text: Venmo, Square, PayPal, credit card apps and other mobile banking platforms perform that function. But all require users to have bank accounts. Public policy dictates that only banks can access the payments system, and the banks made a business decision to drop their least profitable consumers while regulators have stood by.\n\nIn many ways, cryptocurrency is a solution in search of a problem. Or, rather, it solves one particular problem \u2014 making fast and anonymous transactions at the touch of a button \u2014 and does that only by bypassing regulatory controls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Know Your Customer requirements, for example, mandate that banks verify the identity of their customers and stop suspicious activity, which might include funding terrorist groups or sex or drug trafficking. Further restrictions on money transfer attempt to combat the trillions of money laundered annually. Other regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, force banks to closely monitor all transactions. All of these laws make the banking system less agile than a new Facebook currency could be, but that built-in friction prevents crime, protects consumers and reduces systemic risk.\n\nIn attempting to circumvent other important safeguards, Libra could create liquidity or systemic risks that the entire federal banking framework was set up to prevent. The banking system is insured and protected by a massive federal infrastructure, including Federal Reserve liquidity support, FDIC insurance and a secure payments system. These restrictions, the product of centuries of trial and error, were designed to prevent specific historic harms like constant bank runs, liquidity crises and monetary instability. They are designed to protect customer deposits and the integrity of the payments system. Private companies shouldn\u2019t be allowed to bypass these safeguards in the name of international competition. Zuckerberg has warned that China is \u201cmoving quickly to launch similar ideas,\u201d but even the Chinese government prefers to invest in U.S. Treasurys over other options: The U.S. dollar is the world\u2019s preferred currency because of these safeguards \u2014 not despite them. Facebook has yet to demonstrate that it can be trusted not to compromise and manipulate our personal information \u2014 do we really want to trust them with our money?\n\nBy creating and controlling a currency system, Facebook will be positioned to make decisions that will affect the entire economy. (Facebook has promised that it is not trying to compete with the U.S. dollar or create an alternative currency, but that\u2019s exactly what Libra is: a form of value that can be exchanged among businesses and individuals. That is the definition of currency.) Outsourcing important monetary policy decisions to any private company, but especially one as large and reckless as Facebook, carries huge risks. If Libra succeeds in dominating the payments system as it already has in so many other sectors, the Libra will be an independent form of currency, one not issued by the Treasury. Any new currency is inherently volatile, but because Libra is pegged to the U.S. dollar, Libra\u2019s risks will affect the dollar\u2019s risks. Libra also links the dollar to a basket of other currencies, which creates openings for currency speculation, liquidity crises or a situation where the Libra association (a group of tech insiders unlikely to exert any independent control) makes de facto decisions that affect the currency decisions of sovereign nations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s true that financial inclusion would help millions of Americans and benefit the economy. But it can be achieved through time-tested and democratic institutions. In fact, the United States already has a public payments system: the Federal Reserve. Congress created the Federal Reserve in 1913 as a people\u2019s central bank, with a mandate to establish payments markets with an \u201coverall concern for safety and soundness, promotion of operating efficiency, and equitable access.\u201d The Fed\u2019s charter explicitly states that it exists \u201cto serve the public interest\u201d and to increase the integrity, efficiency and equity of U.S. payments. It was a public institution by design and has remained the most secure and trusted network worldwide.\n\nThus far, the Fed has made its payments system available only to banks, but it could open that system to all Americans with a few easy reforms. FedAccounts, for example, would enable any individual or business to access the payments system. Real-time payments would remove the unnecessary delay in payments processing. Then there\u2019s my personal favorite: retail point of contact operations such as a post office checking account. These would allow the unbanked or underbanked to have a simple checking account at their local post office, to get their paychecks cashed immediately and then to use whatever mobile app they prefer to send and receive money. Such simple policy changes could increase savings, ease access to funds, and help many individuals and communities cross the cash-digital divide.\n\nZuckerberg says Libra will help the disadvantaged, a highly dubious claim for a massive private corporation that mainly aims to create shareholder profits. It is ironic for \u201cthe richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people,\u201d as Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) pointed out. That\u2019s because the financial system\u2019s issues are not problems with technology: They are problems of policy. They should be addressed in Congress and the people\u2019s bank, not in Facebook\u2019s boardroom.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Millions of Americans are unbanked, but the problem isn\u2019t technology \u2014 it\u2019s policy.", "authors": ["Mehrsa Baradaran", "Mehrsa Baradaran Is The J.
