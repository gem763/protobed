Bolton has agreed to be represented by Javelin\u2019s Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn.\n\nWhy it matters: Given the fact that he wrote a book about his tenure in the George W. Bush administration, from the moment he left the White House, senior officials privately expressed concerns about what Bolton might say and reveal about his time serving Trump.\n\nLatimer and Urbahn had previously represented former FBI Director James Comey and former Trump staffer Cliff Sims for their 7-figure book deals.\n\nBolton said last month that he had a \u201cself-imposed restriction\u201d on discussing specifics from his time in the White House.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
