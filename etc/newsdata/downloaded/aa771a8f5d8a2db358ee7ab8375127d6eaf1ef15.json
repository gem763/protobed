(Picture: iStock Editorial)\n\nAn estimated 5.43 million young people in the UK have been the victims of cyber bullying. In a bid to combat online abuse, Instagram has released a new in-app feature that will allow users to restrict the interaction they have with bullies.\n\nThe new \u2018Restrict\u2019 feature enables you to swipe on a user, placing them on restrict. This means that you will no longer see their comments, unless you specifically tap on \u2018See Comment\u2019.\n\nNobody else will be able to view the comment, except for the bully who posted it.\n\nStarting today you can protect your account from unwanted interactions with a new feature called Restrict. This is just one of the ways we\u2019re empowering our community to stand up to bullying. https://t.co/65WJuAOdON pic.twitter.com/WOaNnsJC1y \u2014 Instagram (@instagram) October 2, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou won\u2019t receive any notifications from these restricted accounts, and any messages from the user will remain in Message Requests.\n\nEven if you choose to open the message, the user will not be able to tell whether you\u2019ve opened it, or when you were last active on the app.\n\n\u2018Bullying is a complex issue, and we know that young people face a disproportionate amount of online bullying but are reluctant to report or block peers who bully them,\u2019 Instagram said in a statement.\n\nSo why are some users reluctant to block their aggressors? Well, as we know, some bullies just don\u2019t back down.\n\nUsers who are blocked are still able to retaliate outside of the platform, and even create multiple accounts to continue their taunts.\n\nThe Restrict tool will mean that users can \u2018quietly\u2019 protect their account. The bullies won\u2019t even know what you\u2019ve done.\n\nIt\u2019s just been rolled out to coincide with National Bullying Prevention Month in the US, but the feature will be available worldwide.\n\nInstagram has also introduced a \u2018Create Don\u2019t Hate sticker\u2019 in Stories, which encourages users to post about how they\u2019ve used their creativity to call out bullying.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The new 'Restrict' feature enables you to swipe on a user, placing them on restrict.
