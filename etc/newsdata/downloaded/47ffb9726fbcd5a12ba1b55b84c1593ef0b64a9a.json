Earlier this year, sources told Reuters that the banks were considering a tie-up.\n\nBusiness daily Boersen-Zeitung first reported on the plans on Tuesday.\n\nHelaba is one of Germany\u2019s landesbanks, which are traditionally owned by savings banks and regional states.\n\nDeka is owned by 12 regional savings banks and serves as an asset manager for all of Germany\u2019s savings banks.\n\nGermany\u2019s savings banks umbrella organization, DSGV, has pushed for mergers and its president, Helmut Schleweis, last year floated the idea of creating a so-called super-landesbank, or a central bank for the savings banks.\n\nA spokesman for Deka declined to elaborate. Helaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "German public-sector banks Helaba and Deka will consider a merger, a spokeswoman for Germany's savings banks association said on Tuesday, in a sign of consolidation of the country's fragmented banking sector.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
