But, investigators also concluded there was \u201cno persuasive evidence\u201d that anyone deliberately mishandled classified information\n\nUsing a private email system \u201cadded an increased degree of risk of compromise, as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of the State Department,\u201d the review said.\n\nInvestigators covered 33,000 emails that Mrs. Clinton turned over for review. The State Department said it found a total of 588 violations, but it could only assign blame for 91 violations.\n\nThe reason the State Department could not assign fault was because some of the individuals left the agency during the time it took to complete the investigation.\n\nAnother obstacle, according to the report, was more than 30,000 records were reviewed.\n\nThe report didn\u2019t say what if any disciplinary action employees will face nor did it name who is responsible for the violations. But violations tied to current State Department officials are sent to the Bureau of Human Resources and former employees have the violations mentioned in their files.\n\nInvestigators handed the report over to Congress earlier this month. It was released Friday by the office of Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican who chaired the Judiciary Committee until last year.\n\nThe State Department received the emails in December 2014, long after Mrs. Clinton left the department in early 2013.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s email controversy dogged her through the 2016 election, helping to sink her presidential campaign.\n\nThe Clinton campaign accused Republicans of blowing it out of proportion, but President Trump and his supporters insisted she engaged in criminal behavior and was never punished.\n\nTrump supporters chanting \u201clock her up\u201d at campaign rallies were largely inspired by the server controversy.\n\nAn FBI investigation was launched in 2015 after it was revealed that she used a personal server for government emails. Former FBI Director James B. Comey famously announced that the Justice Department would not be filing charges against Mrs. Clinton.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Comey concluded Mrs. Clinton had been \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d but \u201cno reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
