The film production company responsible for the James Bond series of films is run by Barbara Broccoli and her half-brother Michael G. Wilson.\n\n\"I don't think that's going to happen with the Broccolis. I don't think that is going to happen under their watch,\" he said.\n\nIf and when it finally happens, the legendary character needs to do adapt to the times, according to him. \"The #MeToo movement has been relevant and significant and well needed in our society, so they'll have to address that,\" he said.\n\nBrosnan said acting as 007 was his career highlight. \"James Bond has a certain significance and a deep pride. I will be asked about him until my dying days -- it just goes with the territory. He's a beloved character.\"\n\nThe new Bond film, \"No Time to Die,\" is slated to come out in April 2020. The movie starring Daniel Craig as James Bond will center around him coming out of retirement after a mysterious villain with armed with dangerous technology emerges. It will also be Craig's last run as the character.", "description": "\"I think we've watched the guys do it for the last 40 years, get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there,\" he said", "authors": ["Christopher Brito"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/09/b1aec6f9-338f-4135-9c7a-36f6dfa5b6dd/thumbnail/1200x630/94375c2387f9bd6725a32b6afd518ec9/gettyimages-1166460838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
