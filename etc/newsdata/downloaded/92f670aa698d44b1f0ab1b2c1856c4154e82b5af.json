The company sought unspecified \"significant\" damages based on what it said was TSMC's unlawful use of its technology in its \"tens of billions of dollars of sales\".\n\nGlobalFoundries alleged that Apple Inc (O: ), Qualcomm Inc (O: ), Alphabet Inc's (O: ) Google, Nvidia Corp (O: ), Lenovo Group (HK: ) and Taiwan' MediaTek Inc (TW: ) were among TSMC customers affected by the complaints.\n\nTSMC at the time called GlobalFoundries' allegations \"baseless\".", "description": "TSMC counter-sues U.S. chip rival GlobalFoundries for patent infringement", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF901RQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
