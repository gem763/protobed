It is a risk to throw him into the deep end in a Rugby World Cup quarter-final, particularly against an Australia side that saves their best performances for this stage.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Jones will dress it up as a squad effort and that the Leicester No 10 has not been dropped, but the matter of fact is that it completely changes how England will play.\n\nThe decision may have been planned all along, with the three selections against Tonga, United States and Argentina possible decoys to hinder Australia\u2019s preparations for this match, but it could also be a last-gasp effort to get Farrell back firing on all cylinders. It is no secret that Farrell has not been at his best this tournament while playing at inside centre, and the move to fly-half may be the key to reigniting the spark within him.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Marler stood up to take on responsibility in the absence of first-choice Mako Vunipola, and ensured that his absence did not become a weakness. AFP via Getty Images 3/16 2. Shota Horie (Japan) Arguably the player of the pool stage. Horie\u2019s familiar locks have made him famous for more than just his rugby skills, but it is what he is doing on the field that he deserves praise for. Standout performances against Ireland and Scotland tell you all you need to know about his form so far. Getty Images 4/16 3. Tadhg Furlong (Ireland) Furlong was outstanding against Samoa and has provided strong consistency across the pool stage to help Ireland get back on their feet. With most tighthead props being rotated game by game, it makes selection rather tricky to look for standout moments, but Furlong\u2019s two crunching runs in his most recent outing see him stand out from the rest.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nJones has gone back to the midfield combination that resulted in the impressive victory over Ireland at the start of the Six Nations, but also the one that failed to fire against Wales three weeks later, meaning there is no certainty to finding the right selection in his back line. Ford and Farrell looked to have rekindled the best of their twin-playmaker partnership when England thrashed the Irish in August, but Jones appears to have decided that they are not clicking quite how he wants. Scott Wisemantel\u2019s admission that Farrell described his own performance against Argentina as \u201cclunky\u201d confirmed as much.\n\nThe sad irony is that just like 2015, Ford has found himself as England\u2019s sacrificial lamb. The fly-half was jettisoned from the starting XV for the infamous defeat against Wales, where Lancaster allowed his doubts get the better of him by ditching his preferred midfield partnership in an attempt to shackle Jamie Roberts. It didn\u2019t work then, and there\u2019s a danger it won\u2019t work now. England appear to be deploying a gameplan to disrupt the Wallabies rather than the one that will impose their own style on them \u2013 something that they have done in the last six victories over Australia. If it doesn\u2019t work, it will be Jones\u2019s head on the block.", "description": "Eddie Jones has taken a huge gamble in changing a tried and tested team to move Owen Farrell back to fly-half \u2013 but it is a roll of the dice that could well prove to be his Sam Burgess moment.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/07/eddie-jones-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
