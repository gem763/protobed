At 1550 feet the tower is the world's tallest residential apartment building, according to the developer, Extell Development Co. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)\n\nBarnett spoke at a ceremony Tuesday to celebrate that the tower \u2014 on Manhattan\u2019s so-called Billionaire\u2019s Row \u2014 has reached its full height. It took place on the 107th floor of the tower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics have complained the tall, skinny towers proliferating along the southern edge of Central Park during the last few years are casting shadows on the park, but Barnett dismissed those concerns for the Central Park Tower.\n\n\"We've done shadow studies,\" he said. \"It's just a question of, you know, occasionally somebody might be sitting somewhere in the park and there'll be a shadow for, I don't know, 20 or 30 minutes.\"\n\nThe Central Park Tower is pictured under construction in New York in July.

Its 1,550-foot height makes it taller than One World Trade Center without its crowning spire.\n\nThe Council on Tall Buildings measures One World Trade Center's height as 1,776 feet, a tally that includes the spire, and makes it the tallest building in the United States. But if it is measured to the roof, One World Trade Center's height would be 1,368 feet, which is the height of the original building destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nBy comparison, Chicago's Willis Tower is 1,451 feet when measured to the top of its roof and 1,729 feet when measured to the top of the television masts atop its roof.\n\nCentral Park Tower will be the world's tallest building that is mostly residential, although there are other buildings with a residential component that will be taller.\n\nExtell's partners in the project include Nordstrom, which is building a seven-story department store at the building's base.\n\nTuesday\u2019s ceremony came days after a report from StreetEasy found that more than 25 percent of condos that have been built in New York City since 2013 remain unsold.\n\nIn terms of unit, 16,242 condos have been built since 2013, of which 12,133 were sold. That means more than 4,100 have not.\n\nThe median price of a condo in Manhattan is $2.3 million.\n\nThe view of Central Park is pictured from an upper floor of the Central Park Tower on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)\n\nA backlog of unsold units has not stopped construction. According to the report, 63 buildings with more than 5,600 units are listed but have construction hasn't been finished.\n\nInvestors appear to hold a large proportion of these properties because they have shown up on the rental market. According to StreetEasy, 30 percent of the condos built since 2013 have been listed for rent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nResearchers say these trends could be indicative of a potential future recession.\n\n\u201cNew Yorkers can expect this condo hangover to last well into the future,\u201d the report predicted.\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Brittany De Lea and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Central Park Tower, which is expected to open in New York City next year, is expected to enter a crowded market of luxury buildings.", "authors": ["Ann Schmidt"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Supertall-Condo-Ap1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
