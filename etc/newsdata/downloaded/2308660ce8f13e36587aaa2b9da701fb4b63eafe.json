The United States says trade with Turkey totaled $24 billion in 2017, with the U.S. surplus standing at $1.5 billion.\n\nThe two ministers are due to hold further talks in Ankara next week.", "description": "Turkey calls on U.S. to lift barriers to boost trade", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF860MB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
