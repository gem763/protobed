I approach music from a very chaotic place, and yet I've figured out how to work through that chaotic non-process and find ways to organize it.\"\n\nGiven the course's Halloween release, USA TODAY called up Elfman to chat about \"Nightmare,\" Disney's beloved stop-motion fantasy about a good-intentioned skeleton who hijacks Christmas.\n\nIn \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" Jack Skellington stumbles through a portal into Christmas Town and decides to celebrate the holiday by taking over for Santa Claus. (Photo: NONE, XXX Disney)\n\nQuestion: So just to clear up the debate online: Is \"Nightmare\" a Halloween or Christmas movie?\n\nAnswer: It's obviously about Christmas, but for me, it's a Halloween movie. Growing up, Halloween was my favorite night of the year and Christmas was a troublesome time. Into my adult years, it was a time where a bit of a dark cloud would follow me around \u2013 probably carrying over from my childhood until I had my own kids \u2013 and then I developed a new, brighter view of Christmas.\n\nI also felt very close to Jack Skellington's plight because I knew what it was like to be the king of my own little world, and to want out of that world and want something else. So I felt very close to the holiday of Halloween, but also very close to Jack and what he was going through.\n\nDanny Elfman not only wrote the \"Nightmare\" songs, but also provided the singing voice of Halloween Town's top denizen Jack Skellington, aka the Pumpkin King.

Was there one song that you found hardest to \"crack?\"\n\nA:The hardest challenge for a song was \"Poor Jack,\" because within two-and-a-half minutes, he has to sing the song and completely turn the story around. He starts out totally depressed that he's messed up everything, but then has to convince himself that everything's great and he can fix it all.\n\nQ: Do you have a personal favorite song in the movie?\n\nA: They were all really fun, but if I had a personal favorite, it might be, oddly, a song called \"The Town Meeting\" because I liked the up-and-back patter. I was using inspirations that were all archaic: Cole Porter, Gilbert and Sullivan, Kurt Weill. My intention was to create something as timeless as I could, but to have it not feel like a contemporary Broadway musical (number). That was the one thing that I absolutely didn't want to do, and Tim was in agreement with me. In that particular moment, \"The Town Meeting,\" I felt like, \"Oh, I'm tapping into a little bit of this Cole Porter style.\"\n\nQ: You've talked before about a disastrous test screening of \"Nightmare\" back in 1993, after which Disney pulled the merchandise and tried to market it to adults instead of kids. How did you feel about the response at the time?\n\nA: I was extremely frustrated, because I'm used to spending three months on a movie \u2013 not two years. I'd never had anything like this, so I was really strongly personally invested to see it all kind of unraveling. I did a press junket in Disney World for two days and almost every interviewer that I talked to would say the same thing: \"This is too scary for kids, right?\" And I just kept going, \"No, no, no, it really isn't. Are your kids scared of Halloween? There's nothing here that's going to scare them.\" Then I would hear stuff like, \"We hear that Santa Claus gets tortured.\" And I'd say, \"No, no, no. He doesn't get tortured, he's mildly inconvenienced and he's fine about it!\"\n\nThis was the vibe following the film around, and Disney had no way to comprehend what it was. So it doesn't surprise me that they found themselves thinking, \"This just isn't going to work, it's not for kids.\"\n\nSally (left, voiced by Catherine O'Hara) and Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon) in a scene from \"The Nightmare Before Christmas.\" (Photo: NONE, XXX Disney)\n\nQ: Was there a moment when you realized it had gotten a cult following?\n\nA: Well, a decade later, I remember being with Tim in Tokyo for \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" and we were seeing Jack Skellington and Sally merchandise everywhere that we'd never seen before. And there was a nightclub in Tokyo inspired by \"Nightmare Before Christmas.\" So there was this feeling of, \"It's not going away,\" and Disney did pick up on that and started to put some energy back into it again.\n\nIt was a really lucky break of getting a second chance, because that just doesn't happen with movies. I consider it one of the great joys of my career that \"Nightmare\" got discovered on its own by an audience.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/30/nightmare-before-christmas-composer-its-halloween-movie/2505238001/", "description": "\"Nightmare Before Christmas\" composer Danny Elfman shares stories about the making of the 1993 animated movie, initially deemed \"too scary\" for kids.", "authors": ["Patrick Ryan", "Published A.M.
