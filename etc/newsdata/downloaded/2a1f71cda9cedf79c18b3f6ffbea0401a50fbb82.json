Dan Petrescu\u2019s players knocked Celtic out of the Champions League qualifiers when they won 4-3 in an extraordinary encounter in the east end of Glasgow in August.\n\nThe defeat unleashed the usual social media opprobrium in the direction of Neil Lennon, whom many detractors declared to be unfit for purpose. Since then, the manager has supervised a comprehensive programme of revival, including victory in the first Old Firm derby of the season at Ibrox, progress to the Betfred Scottish League Cup semi-finals and unbroken leadership of the Scottish Premiership, despite last Sunday\u2019s draw with Hibs at Easter Road.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNow the chance to exorcise the memory of the defeat by Cluj presents itself and Lennon welcomed the opportunity when he said: \u201cI was pleased to get Cluj again because it was a quick opportunity to right a wrong, if you want to call it that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been steady and really good progress since then, so I\u2019ve been delighted with the reaction. Cluj are a good side and that has been underestimated. They ran Slavia Prague close in the final Champions League qualifier and they\u2019ve beaten Lazio. They play an effective style of football. They don\u2019t play through teams that much.\n\n\u201cThey hit a lot of diagonals and put the ball in the box. They\u2019ve got good energy and a good spirit about them, too. I expect the game to be played at a fast tempo.\n\nCFR Cluj's George Tucudean celebrates scoring their fourth goal against the Glasgow giants in August Credit: Action Images\n\n\u201cI hope they expect the Celtic who turned up in the first half, not the second half. In the second half we scored three goals and I don\u2019t see many clubs getting three against Cluj in 45 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt showed me what we were capable of but we let the first 45 minutes drift away from us. We were passive and we can\u2019t be like that in Europe, so we want to start as strongly as we can and get the decibel level up, because the players can really react to that.\u201d\n\nOne choice facing Lennon is whether to play Olivier Ntcham wide on the left or bring in Mohamed Elyounoussi. Much of the criticism directed at Lennon after the teams\u2019 previous meeting stemmed from his deployment of Callum McGregor at left-back in order to accommodate Ntcham\u2019s technical qualities, a switch that failed to deliver.\n\nAsked if he had to resolve a dilemma regarding Ntcham, Lennon said: \"Sometimes we change it up and it\u2019s been successful for us and sometimes it\u2019s horses for courses in terms of who we are playing.\n\n\u201cHe may start, he may not. If he does, we have confidence in him, if not, we have confidence in him coming off the bench and making a positive reaction.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard insists he will not use the artificial surface at the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf as an excuse when his side take on Young Boys.\n\nThe Light Blues face the Swiss champions in their second Europa League group game on Thursday looking to follow up their opening home win against Feyenoord with another positive result.\n\nYoung Boys' home advantage will be keenly felt, with Rangers opting not to take up their ticket allocation for the game, while the visitors will also have to cope with playing on an artificial pitch.\n\nThe Ibrox side have had plenty of experience of playing on such surfaces in Scotland and Gerrard believes his players will cope again on Thursday.\n\nHe said: \"Astroturf pitches are Astroturf pitches, you've just got to get on with it. We don't want to use it as an excuse.\n\n\"Of course they'll have an advantage, being at home with all the fans in the stadium and being a lot more used to the pitch than us. But we do get enough games to be able to cope on Astroturf pitches.\"", "description": "The Old Firm pair aim to advance positive starts to their Europa League group stage campaigns \u2013 Rangers enjoyed a home win over Feyenoord and Celtic a draw in Rennes \u2013 but in the case of the Hoops, a powerful element of payback is part of the deal when they meet CFR Cluj at Parkhead on Thursday.
