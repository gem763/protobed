Pramila Jayapal\u2019s new Medicare-for-All bill, the Democrats reiterated their commitment to continue the health care fight Barack Obama started. The bill would make the insurance system entirely public, eliminating a private insurance system that has become too expensive for many Americans. But the Democrats, much like Obama, aren\u2019t diagnosing the problem correctly. They wrongly assume that the lack of insurance is the issue, when, in fact, it\u2019s the insurance model we use.\n\nHealth insurance is not the same as health care. Yet politicians can\u2019t seem to help but use the terms interchangeably.\n\nAs of 2016, 27 million people lacked health insurance because they didn\u2019t have an employer-sponsored insurance plan, didn\u2019t meet the Medicaid eligibility criteria, and couldn\u2019t afford private insurance. Of course, it\u2019s better for the highest possible number of people to have access to health care when they need it rather than trying to tough out illness and letting it get out of hand. And according to Democrats, they could do just that if only everyone could have access to health insurance. But that\u2019s not quite the case.\n\nHealth insurance is often conflated with health care. But health care is what you get when you interact with a provider: a diagnosis, a prescription, surgery, and so on. Meanwhile, health insurance is how you pay for it. Yet politicians can\u2019t seem to help but use the terms interchangeably.\n\nIllogical Conflation\n\nThis logic doesn\u2019t compute. Take car insurance, for example. A vehicle is not the same thing as car insurance. A car owner takes care of her car on her own, keeping it clean and fixing minor issues herself. If the car gets damaged in an accident, insurance saves the day; if not, it stays largely uninvolved.\n\nHealth insurance should work the same way that car insurance does, but right now it doesn\u2019t. Routine procedures, drug prescriptions for chronic disease, and a variety of other predictable and non-urgent procedures are all handled through insurance companies. And patients don\u2019t receive full reimbursement for the results of major catastrophes. For many procedures, there are co-pays, out-of-network fees, non-covered services, and deductibles.\n\nIf health insurance functioned like car insurance and the entire population was covered, perhaps everyone would be better off.\n\nFor the 27 million Americans without health insurance, research shows they don\u2019t seek preventative care and services for major health conditions and chronic diseases as often as people with insurance. They\u2019re more likely than insured individuals to accumulate medical debt, too. These realities are certainly concerning. But the uninsured aren\u2019t the only ones struggling with medical debt. In fact, it\u2019s the number one cause of personal bankruptcy in the country. In 2014, 40 percent of the population had medical debt.\n\nIt\u2019s understandably frustrating that millions of Americans have to incur debt to receive the care they desperately need. It\u2019s why an increasing number of people believe health care is a right and support universal coverage as the solution to this crisis. If health insurance functioned like car insurance and the entire population were covered, perhaps everyone would be better off.\n\nUnachievable with Government Intervention\n\nYet there are two key differences. First, car insurance isn\u2019t a state-run program, and there\u2019s plenty of competition. There are dozens of companies competing to offer car owners the insurance plan that meets their needs at a price they\u2019re willing to pay. Those incentives force car insurance companies to exclude reimbursement for minor damages because they can\u2019t stay in business very long if so many expenses are owed to their customers.\n\nHealth insurance is provided by a mixture of public and private payers, and it funds a significant share of the vast majority of procedures.\n\nThe second difference is that repair shops, tire manufacturers, and other providers of routine car fixes all compete on price to get the largest possible share of the millions of car owners in the market for their products and services. Neither of these features characterizes the health care market as we currently know it. Health insurance is provided by a mixture of public and private payers, and it funds a significant share of the vast majority of procedures. Providers don\u2019t compete on price even for services that millions need on a regular basis.\n\nWhen it comes to health insurance, people expect their coverage to give them more than they pay in, as if health care were a high-return investment opportunity. If one person\u2019s treatment costs $120,000 a year and they pay a monthly premium of $1,000, the company needs nine people to pay $1,000 a month and not consume any health care services just to break even. But they might need even more, as a company probably requires a few more perfectly healthy insurees to cover its administrative and marketing costs.\n\nLet insurance be what it was meant to be: peace of mind against catastrophe.\n\nThe primary role of insurance isn\u2019t to pay bills; it\u2019s to give customers peace of mind\u2014a guarantee that a catastrophic health event will not bankrupt them. And when they\u2019re in need of more minor health care services, consumers should be looking for the best-value care in the market because those costs would be coming out of their pockets. Yet the high levels of medical debt show that our current insurance system has strayed far from this model as the prices for minor procedures and treatments have gone through the roof.\n\nIncreased coverage sounds nice. But even after getting the number of uninsured people to zero, we\u2019d still struggle with unaffordable copays and deductibles and staggering levels of medical debt. The first step toward obtaining an affordable health insurance system that works in favor of all of us is to let insurance be what it was meant to be: peace of mind against catastrophe.", "description": "Health insurance should work the same way that car insurance does, but right now it doesn\u2019t.", "authors": ["Relarticle.Author", "-", "Relarticle.Pub_Date", "Date", "'Mmmm Dd", "Yyyy'"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-03-20"}
