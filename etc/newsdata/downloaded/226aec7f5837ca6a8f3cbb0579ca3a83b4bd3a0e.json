Johnson, ally of Trump and Ukraine, surfaces in crucial episodes in the saga", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI was in Washington, and Sen. Johnson found out I was in D.C., and staff called me and wanted to do a meeting with me. So I reached out back and said, \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll come down the Hill and talk to you,\u2019 \u201d Telizhenko told The Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn individual close to Johnson confirmed that staff for one of his committees met with Telizhenko as part of an ongoing investigation into the FBI and its probes of the 2016 election, but declined to say whether the senator was involved.\n\nThe meeting points to Johnson\u2019s emerging role as the member of Congress most heavily involved in the Ukraine saga that has engulfed the White House and has threatened Trump with impeachment.\n\nThe senator\u2019s committee assignments place him at the center of U.S.-Ukraine policymaking: Johnson is chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation and vice chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, a bipartisan group formed in 2015 to boost ties between Washington and Kyiv. He is also chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, a panel with investigative powers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore significantly, testimony from two blockbuster witnesses in the impeachment probe place Johnson at episodes that will be critical in assessing whether Trump was withholding nearly $400 million in congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine in exchange for political favors. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky faced pressure to announce investigations into the Bidens and the debunked conspiracy theory that a hacked DNC server was taken to Ukraine in 2016 to hide evidence that it was that country, not Russia, that interfered in the presidential election.\n\nJohnson\u2019s knowledge of key events could make him a person of interest to House impeachment investigators, as well as complicate his role as a juror in a trial by the Senate, if one occurs. There are no rules forcing senators with possible conflicts of interest to recuse themselves during impeachment proceedings, and Johnson, through a spokesman, declined to comment on what he would do.\n\nExperts said that even the appearance of a conflict of interest would be problematic for a senator during an impeachment trial, but declined to comment specifically on Johnson\u2019s case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the most important and sacred obligation of the Senate \u2014 to make the decision about whether or not a sitting president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. It would stain the process even if the jurors had a potential conflict. This shouldn\u2019t be a legalistic question, but one of the basic integrity of senators,\u201d said Corey Brettschneider, a professor of political science and expert in constitutional law at Brown University.\n\nJohnson\u2019s position is complicated by his dual roles \u2014 as an ally and advocate for both Trump and Ukraine.\n\nHe has been an outspoken supporter of U.S. military aid to Ukraine since at least 2015 and has urged several times that Ukraine root out corruption in its prosecutor general\u2019s office.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has accused former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 a potential 2020 rival \u2014 of trying to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to stop an investigation of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company in which his son, Hunter Biden, had served on the board.\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, the Obama administration, other Western officials and a bipartisan group of senators, including Johnson, had pressed Ukraine to address corruption, notably in a letter in February 2016 to then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Poroshenko has also rebutted Trump\u2019s claim about Biden, saying this month that the former vice president never asked him to open or close cases.\n\nJohnson has had to strike a delicate balance in recent months between these positions and his support for Trump.\n\nAD\n\nA conservative Republican elected in 2010, the former manufacturing executive co-sponsored a Senate resolution this week condemning the House impeachment inquiry. He has forcefully defended the president in the media, and last month, wrote a letter that mentioned Telizhenko and his claims while asking Attorney General William P. Barr to investigate any links between Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign and Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSuch allegations of corruption deserve due scrutiny, and the American people have a right to know when foreign forces attempt to undermine our democratic processes,\u201d wrote Johnson and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa).\n\nInterviews this month highlighted Johnson\u2019s unusual position.\n\nAD\n\nOn Oct. 4, Johnson told the Wall Street Journal that he \u201cwinced\u201d when told by a key diplomat in August that Trump would release the hold on military aid for Ukraine if Zelensky launched an investigation into \u201cwhat happened in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reaction was: Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined,\u201d he told the paper. Johnson said Trump adamantly denied a quid pro quo the next day, telling Johnson: \u201cNo way. I would never do that. Who told you that?\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 6, Johnson gave a combative interview during NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d As host Chuck Todd pressed him on why he had \u201cwinced\u201d at Trump allegedly conditioning military aid on investigations, Johnson emphasized that the president \u201cvehemently, angrily denied\u201d that such an arrangement ever existed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohnson also expressed sympathy for Trump and attacked the media, saying he had \u201cnever seen a president\u2019s administration be sabotaged from the day after election.\u201d\n\nTelizhenko, with whom Johnson met in July, is a political consultant and former Ukrainian diplomat who has fueled the unsubstantiated theory embraced by Trump that Ukraine assisted Clinton in the 2016 election with help from the Democratic National Committee. The DNC has denied those claims.\n\nThe 29-year-old Ukrainian national had a lengthy meeting in May with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who later said the two discussed U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nTelizhenko said he discussed two unsubstantiated claims with Giuliani that have since become central to Trump\u2019s attitudes toward Ukraine \u2014 that the Ukrainian embassy in Washington where Telizhenko once worked aided Clinton\u2019s campaign, and that Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to stop an investigation of the energy company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTelizhenko told The Post that the \u201cDNC issue\u201d was also \u201cone of the top topics\u201d during his meetings with Johnson and Senate staffers, referring to his claim that a Ukrainian American working as a DNC contractor coordinated with the embassy to find compromising material on Trump and Manafort.\n\nEmbassy staffers, the former contractor and the Biden family have vehemently denied these claims.\n\nIt is unclear whether impeachment investigators are looking at Johnson as a potential witness in the inquiry. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) declined to comment when asked about the possibility on Friday.\n\nYet the senator has been involved in key moments of the story.\n\nJohnson attended Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May with U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, then-special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and National Security Council official Alexander Vindman. All but Perry and Johnson have testified or are scheduled to testify in the House probe.\n\nAD\n\nThe group returned from Ukraine and debriefed Trump and key aides at the White House on May 23. Sondland testified this month that Trump urged them to talk to Giuliani about his concerns about corruption in Ukraine, guidance that opened the informal diplomatic channel used to facilitate the alleged quid pro quo.\n\nJohnson denied Sondland\u2019s version of events this week, saying he had \u201cno recollection of the president mentioning Rudy Giuliani\u201d at the May 23 meeting.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland said that was when that all began. I have no recollection of that at all,\u201d Johnson told The Post in a brief interview on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn early September, Johnson met in Kyiv with Zelensky, who asked about the freeze on military aid, but according to Johnson, did not \u201cmention or indicate that he was feeling pressure.\u201d\n\nTrump had barred Johnson from telling Zelensky that aid was on its way, Johnson told reporters in Sheboygan, Wis., this month.\n\nWilliam B. Taylor Jr., the United States\u2019 top diplomat in Ukraine, testified this week that Johnson and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told Zelensky in that meeting that bipartisan support in Washington was a strategic asset and that he should not jeopardize it \u201cby getting drawn into U.S. domestic politics.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 4, Johnson told reporters that he was not in favor of the president using his office to pressure a foreign government to launch investigations that could benefit him politically \u2014 but added that he was \u201cnot sure that\u2019s what\u2019s happening\u201d with Trump.\n\nThe previous day, he had said there was nothing wrong with Trump urging China to investigate his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cI want to find out what happened during 2016,\u201d Johnson said in Middleton, Wis., according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \u201cIf there\u2019s potential criminal activity, the president of the United States is our chief law enforcement officer. We have proper agreements with countries to investigate potential crimes so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything improper about doing that.\u201d", "description": "In a previously unreported contact, Johnson met in July with a former Ukrainian diplomat who has circulated unproven claims that Ukrainian officials helped Hillary Clinton in 2016.", "authors": ["Elise Viebeck", "Enterprise", "Investigations Reporter Focused On Politics", "Dalton Bennett", "Video Reporter Focusing On Investigative Stories Ranging Government Accountability To International Corruption."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Kv_4ffcZNnRMr3mgDSE4bK6P8yY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSPIMUXYAUI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
