She reportedly texted a friend that she wanted to leave town the night she died.\n\n\"She posted messages saying she felt as if people were after her to attack and hurt her and she had a conversation with one of her best friends the day she was murdered saying she wanted to leave [the city],\" her friend Antorris Williams told Out.", "description": "On the still dark morning of September 4, tucked behind a rural Florida neighbourhood dotted with single-story houses painted bright green, turquoise and pink, flames licked the metal frame of a PT Cruiser parked in the grass.When Hendry County Sheriff's deputies doused the flames, they found a woman", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V3LUXK3zTFBoESV_LvBFwg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/f235f3dff1f0637a9801d5816c20294e", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
