Sales times around the UK", "language": "en", "text": "House sellers who ask too much for their property and have to later cut the price end up waiting considerably longer to secure a buyer compared to those who put an 'accurate' price tag on, new research suggests.\n\nHomes in Blackburn, Oxford and St Helens take the longest, spending more than two months more time on the market than accurately priced ones in the same location, according to Zoopla.\n\nThe property website has defined as 'overpriced' those homes where sellers reduced the original asking price at least once before being sold, while an 'accurately' valued home is one which sells at the original listed price.\n\nSale time: Overpriced homes in Oxford took three months to sell last year\n\nIt used its own listing data and final sale prices across England and Wales from the Land Registry for 2018 to make the findings.\n\nIn Blackburn, Lancashire, where the average house price stands at \u00a3117,500, homes were on the market 70 days on average before being sold last year.\n\nBut when buyers were too ambitious with their pricing, it took them three months on average to sell. That is an extra 64 days, or more than two months, compared to just 27 days for fairly priced homes in the same area.\n\nAnd the research only measured those homes that did eventually go under offer and sell, not those that remain sitting on the market long-term.\n\nTIME ON MARKET: REGIONAL DIFFERENCES Rank Town Average time to sell Average price achieved Time to sell (accurately priced) Time to sell (overpriced) 1 North East 55 \u00a3123,000 22 90 2 Wales 48 \u00a3145,000 17 83 3 North West 51 \u00a3145,000 21 85 4 London 62 \u00a3445,000 24 84 5 Yorkshire and the Humber 44 \u00a3149,000 18 76 6 South East 54 \u00a3308,000 21 78 7= East of England 49 \u00a3270,000 19 73 7= South West 44 \u00a3233,500 16 70 9 East Midlands 40 \u00a3172,500 16 69 10 West Midlands 36 \u00a3173,000 17 66\n\nSimilarly, overpriced homes in Oxford and St Helens saw 62 and 61 days added to the average length of time on market compared to properties that were accurately priced.\n\nThe average price of a home in Oxford is \u00a3375,000, while in St Helens it stands at \u00a3103,000.\n\nIn London - which has seen a slowdown in the market as it's home to some of the most expensive homes in the country - homes typically sold after 62 days on the market, rising to 82 days for property that was discounted and falling to 24 days for those not judged as overpriced.\n\nHowever, estate agents and analysts suggest that the London property market has started to pick up in recent months, as sellers have become more realistic in their expectations and are already putting their homes up for sale at lower prices, with buyers taking advantage of the soft market.\n\nIn Blackburn, homes were on the market 70 days on average before being sold last year\n\nTIME ON MARKET: TOP 20 TOWNS Rank Postal Town Average price achieved Median time to sell Time to sell (accurately priced) Time to sell (overpriced) 1 Blackburn \u00a3117,500 70 27 91 2 Oxford \u00a3375,000 77 28 90 3 St Helens \u00a3103,000 69 24 85 4= Blackpool \u00a3105,000 77 26 86 4= Lancaster \u00a3150,000 64 17 77 6= Rotherham \u00a3125,000 48 15 74 6= Wirral \u00a3182,000 55 14 73 8 Pontefract \u00a3130,000 59 25 83 9 Hemel Hempstead \u00a3330,000 67 18 75 10= Newcastle Upon Tyne \u00a3145,000 58 20 76 10= Chesterfield \u00a3150,000 44 14 70 12 Swansea \u00a3142,000 56 16 70 13= Burnley \u00a3100,000 61 28 81 13= Huddersfield \u00a3142,500 49 17 70 13= Wakefield \u00a3154,000 48 14 67 13= Carlisle \u00a3127,750 50 12 65 13= Wigan \u00a3128,000 49 19 72 18= Kings Lynn \u00a3199,999 55 17 69 18= Preston \u00a3152,500 57 17 69 20 Barrow-in-Furness \u00a3120,000 62 22 73 Source: Zoopla\n\nLooking at regional trends, homes in the North East and Wales are more likely to sell the slowest if they are overvalued.\n\nSellers in these two regions took on average an extra 68 days and 66 days to sell compared to homes accurately priced, which typically stayed on the market for 22 and 17 days.\n\nThe shortest difference was found in the Midlands, where an accurately priced home would sell on average after 17 days and an overpriced one in 49 days.\n\nIt comes as recent research by Rightmove showed that asking prices of homes put up for sale in September have fallen for the first time since 2010.\n\nHowever Halifax said earlier this month that house prices are holding steady despite Brexit turmoil and homeowners putting their moves on hold.\n\nLondon: In the capital, it takes on average 62 days for a home to sell\n\nLaura Howard, spokesperson for Zoopla, said research suggests that pricing a home realistically results in a better chance of a quicker sale.\n\n'Entering the market fresh with a price that's too high is not just a gamble that might not pay off, it can actually be detrimental to the selling process,' she added.\n\n'Sellers of Oxford homes that have been overpriced for example, are being forced to wait at least an extra two months for an offer, compared to a reasonably priced property in the area.'", "description": "Homes in Blackburn, Oxford and St Helens take the longest, spending more than two months more time on the market than accurately priced ones in the same location, according to  Zoopla.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
