He said he had been scouting a minor league game in Arizona a few weeks ago when he felt something in his left thigh.\n\nAGENT BLASTS MLB AFTER CHICAGO CUBS' KRIS BRYANT SLIPS ON WET BASE, SUFFERS ANKLE INJURY\n\n\u201cI just thought I\u2019d been standing too long, so I did some squats and stretched out a little bit,\u201d he told Yahoo Sports. \u201cWhen I woke up the next day, I had a knot on the inside of my thigh, but there wasn\u2019t any discoloration or anything like that.\u201d\n\nAfter getting checked by a team trainer, he went to go see a doctor in Phoenix who told him it was a spider bite. He said the bite wasn\u2019t really \u201cdiscolored yet.\u201d Murtaugh then flew to Tennessee to cover his next assignment and his condition worsened.\n\nHe told Yahoo Sports he was experiencing flu-like symptoms, he had a dark-red circle on his thigh, he had a stiff neck and achy joints. The next morning, the circle had gotten bigger and his wife urged him to get the spot checked out.\n\nCHICAGO WHITE SOX'S TIM ANDERSON SAYS HE'S TRYING TO DO 'DOPE STUFF' TO DRAW CROWD BACK TO BALLPARKS\n\n\u201cThey took my blood right away, and then the doctor came in, put her gloves on and looked at my thigh,\u201d he said. \u201cShe looked at it for about a minute and said, \u2018Sir, this is so deep in your tissue that I\u2019m not going to touch it. I\u2019m going to call a surgeon.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018What?!\u2019\u201d\n\nMurtaugh was asked whether he could go to outpatient surgery on the same day. He went to the hospital and underwent surgery where the surgeon had to cut out the venom-filled infection.\n\nHe was later informed that he was bitten by a black widow spider and he was close to having a life-threatening blood infection that could have led to organ failure, according to Yahoo Sports.\n\nMurtaugh said he went right back to work after the surgery and attended a minor league game later that night.\n\n\u201cMy leg was numb, but I felt fine physically because I didn\u2019t have the flu-like symptoms anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people think I was crazy, but that\u2019s just what scouts do. They keep on trucking.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMurtaugh is now back to full health and will not become another number on the Yankees\u2019 injury list.", "description": "The New York Yankees powered through a ton of injuries during the 2019 season but none of them was as dangerous as the illness one of the team\u2019s scout suffered a few weeks ago.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
