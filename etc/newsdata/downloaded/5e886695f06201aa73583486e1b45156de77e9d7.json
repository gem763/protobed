It\u2019s the rare play where standing and picking up your shit and shuffling down steps and going outside\u2014especially onto 42nd Street\u2014immediately after feels like a kind of violence. You\u2019re not ready for it yet. You\u2019re still in Arbery\u2019s world \u2014 murky yet lit by lightning, lyrical and scary, brave and terribly gentle. Coming out of the whole thing is like waking to a bucket of water thrown in your face. But even that jolt feels right in its way, because Heroes is a kind of nightmare.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of that last phrase, this was my reaction as well. What I really wanted to do was stay in my seat and sob to the depths of my being. I\u2019m still trying to articulate what it meant to sit there for two hours, in which most of the time I was oh so uncomfortable, hearing conservative arguments I\u2019m well acquainted with but which very few of my fellow New Yorkers have ever heard, afraid of how the audience would respond. While I was uncomfortable, the woman sitting next to me seemed viscerally angry. But gradually I found my head forgetting the characters\u2019 political leanings and my heart breaking for these beautiful broken people as the play climaxes, when Arbery shatters the political zeitgeist and sends us careening into the supernatural, confusing, devastating pain of humanity where we all truly live. When the lights came up, everyone seemed shaken, including the girl next to me.\n\nThe trick Arbery used that kept everyone in their seats was his resistance to agitprop and his skill at creating five \u201cdeplorables\u201d who are undeniably human. He left us at the end with no absolution for either side of the political spectrum. Every time one of his characters started to sound like the liberal caricature of a conservative, he inserted an insightful self-evaluation or a pointed challenge from another character to deny the audience any chance of feeling justified or superior. His most empathetic character, Emily, responds to Theresa\u2019s rabid attack on pro-abortionists by insisting that one can still like pro-choice people. I was sure he\u2019d make Emily pro-choice but he didn\u2019t. It was genius. He would take a character just to the brink of a liberal\u2019s comfort zone, but never hand any of the characters over to vilify. At the same time, he didn\u2019t affirm or valorize any of the five characters\u2019 conservative leanings. What he did was show fully-realized, particular, complicated conservatives, a very rare event for an American stage.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what Arbery really thinks of conservatives. He mentioned in an NYT article being angry at Trump\u2019s victory and needing to write about what kind of person could possibly vote for him. He certainly sounds, at the very least, ambivalent. NYMag\u2019s Holdren seems to think the play indicates that the conservative worldview is on its last breath, not worth saving, and that the generator\u2019s scream doubles the characters over like \u201cdevils in torment, hearing the sound of their own sad, poisoned souls.\u201d It\u2019s telling, then, that the bar is so low that right-leaners will grab at any little crumb that comes their way from the entertainment world, even one that isn\u2019t really, at its core, for them. It\u2019s to his immense credit that he\u2019s willing to run the risk of conservatives hailing him as their champion, even if he feels otherwise. And it\u2019s to his immense talent, that if he is as ambivalent as he sounds, conservatives consider this a positive description. (Also, I said to my husband that only a Catholic could have written the ending with the supernatural surprises. How he touched down, just for a second, on that topic [regarding Kevin\u2019s parting story and Justin\u2019s \u201clie\u201d] was superb story-telling. Emily\u2019s unrelenting channeling was devastating.)\n\nArbery keeps the liberals in their seats because of his riveting, intelligent, funny dialogue, he keeps the conservatives there by reflecting back to them characters they\u2013to some degree\u2013recognize, and he keeps the rest of us there by giving voice to our longing that both sides would stop for a second and recognize that we\u2019re all human, and that we deserve to be treated with the respect due for simply being human. I came to New York to work in theater and have seen countless excellent plays in my life. But I can count on one hand the number of times a production has reached a place so deep within me that I couldn\u2019t breathe and sobbing seemed like the only response. I will not soon forget this play. Please thank Will Arbery from this New Yorker for counting all of us human.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-15-at-1.14.13-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
