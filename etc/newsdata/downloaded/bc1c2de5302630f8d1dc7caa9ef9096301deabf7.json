It must have these features These are the nine things we would include in the perfect smartphone.\n\nGoogle has added a new plan on top of its one and only Fi Flexible plan. It's called Unlimited but actually has limits.\n\nThe price of the new Unlimited option on Google's Fi voice and data service depends on how many people are signed up to an individual plan and how much data they use.\n\nThe Unlimited plan for one person costs $70 per month, while for two people it costs $120 per month or $60 a line, and the three-person plan costs $150 per month or $50 per line. The prices exclude taxes and government fees.\n\nSEE: IT pro's guide to the evolution and impact of 5G technology (free PDF)\n\nThe plan provides high-speed data until an individual user reaches 22GB usage and after that speeds are reduced. According to Google, this cap will affect about 1% of Fi's current users.\n\nAnd the plan includes high-speed data and texts in over 200 countries around the world at no extra cost.\n\nThere are also free calls to over 50 countries and territories, while calls to other destinations cost one cent per minute. And Google is throwing in Google One membership, which offers 100GB of cloud storage per member.\n\nSince Google Fi's launch in 2015, the business unit has only offered the Fi Flexible plan, which allows customers to pay for just the data they use. The Flexible plan for three users, for example, costs $17 for each user and then $10 per GB for data. Google One membership isn't included.\n\nHowever, Google says customers want more predictable payment arrangements.\n\n\"As we've grown, we've heard that many of you want the simplicity and predictability that comes with paying the same price each month,\" said Dhwani Shah, product manager at Google Fi.\n\nSEE: Google Pixel 3 XL review: Constant surprise and delight\n\nGoogle is even throwing in a sweetener on its Pixel 3 or Pixel XL phones. Until September 18 it will give 50% off a purchase when users activate an account on Google Fi.\n\n\"Our Unlimited plan gives you peace of mind knowing that you can reach family and friends wherever they are, while keeping costs low,\" said Shah.\n\n\"If you prefer to just pay for the data you use, our Flexible plan isn't going anywhere. And as always, Fi has no contracts or activation fees.\"", "description": "Google introduces a second Google Fi plan to give customers more predictable bills.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/18/a45a1244-4f3e-497c-bd29-7cb8b604cec1/thumbnail/770x578/390720745ce36b5b4e75d858fd9f3280/smartphonelaptopusersistock-914989996.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
