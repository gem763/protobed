Tobias Schwarz/Pool via Reuters\n\nEconomy Minister Peter Altmaier, a close Merkel ally, has floated the idea of such a climate foundation into which Berlin could initially inject 5 billion euros ($5.51 billion) and then 1 billion euros per year.\n\nThe non-profit body would issue interest-free loans for climate protection projects - up to a maximum of 50 billion euros - with the aim of reducing Germany\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\nIt would also collect money through \u201ccitizen bonds\u201d that would offer a guaranteed interest rate of 2% for savings of up to 2,500 euros with a maturity of at least 10 years.\n\nAlexander Dobrindt, a senior lawmaker from Merkel\u2019s Bavarian CSU allies, has proposed a similar climate protection bond, in an effort to smooth Germans\u2019 frustration over the European Central Bank\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy of zero interest rates.\n\nAt an internal meeting of the conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Merkel signalled her support for Altmaier\u2019s proposal, two people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz from the Social Democrats, the junior partner in Merkel\u2019s coalition, rejected Dobrindt\u2019s idea at a joint meeting of coalition budget lawmakers last week, two other people told Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cMARKET-DISTORTING\u201d\n\nMerkel\u2019s conservatives also disagree over the plan.\n\n\u201cSo far it\u2019s not clear how Altmaier\u2019s proposal fits into the broader package for climate protection,\u201d Merkel\u2019s chief budget lawmaker Eckhardt Rehberg said.\n\nRehberg said the additional climate protection measures should be financed without new debt and without the savings of citizens through such state-subsidised bonds.\n\n\u201cWe should not compete as a state with the banks and we should not take over the business of lending, especially not under market-distorting conditions,\u201d Rehberg said.\n\nA SPD lawmaker struck a similarly critical tone.\n\n\u201cThis model is not only expensive and undermines the constitutionally enshrined debt brake,\u201d said the lawmaker who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt also collects money that we don\u2019t need. There simply is no lack of public funds right now.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s constitutionally enshrined debt rules, also known as the debt brake, allow a federal budget deficit of up to 0.35% of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe critics of the \u2018green bonds\u2019 idea argue that the government\u2019s borrowing costs are currently negative. So they doubt the need for the government to collect private money from citizens and then pay for a state-guaranteed bond yield of 2%.\n\nConservative and Social Democratic leaders are expected to present a far-reaching package of climate protection measures on Sept. 20.", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government is split over the creation of a climate foundation that would aim to attract funds from citizens by issuing 'green bonds' with state-subsidised interest rates.", "authors": ["Michael Nienaber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428697753&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A13E", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
