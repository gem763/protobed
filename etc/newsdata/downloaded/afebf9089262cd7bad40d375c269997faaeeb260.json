Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat who has become friendly with Mr. Romney from their service together on the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cHe\u2019s a loyal Republican, but that\u2019s not his first priority \u2014 he\u2019s a bit of a throwback.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump, it is the latest, and perhaps last, installment of an off-and-never-really-on relationship between two men who shared little more than the same political ambition. It began when Mr. Romney, as the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, solicited Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement, and carried through 2016, when the former Massachusetts governor began the year as a ferocious critic of Mr. Trump but ended it as a supplicant, sharing dinner with a president-elect in hopes of becoming his secretary of state.\n\nNow, though, Mr. Romney holds a crucial position of power. He could be part of an effort to eventually remove Mr. Trump from office, and is already in the ear \u2014 and perhaps conscience \u2014 of other Republicans.\n\nHe plays down his role, noting that he is not trying to lead any sort of insurrection against the president.\n\n\u201cI spoke out because I believe this is a matter of importance and personal principle,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing more, nothing less.\u201d\n\nBut by reproaching Mr. Trump, he offers Democrats the ability to counter claims that the inquiry is a wholly partisan and politically fueled witch hunt, as the president has repeatedly called it. And Mr. Romney both provides cover for and exerts pressure on his fellow Republicans, who are anxiously calibrating what to say about a scandal that only deepened on Thursday when audio emerged of Mr. Trump privately suggesting that government officials who expressed concerns about his dealings with Ukraine deserve to be punished severely.", "description": "With most Republicans rushing to defend President Trump against an impeachment push, a \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d Mitt Romney stands apart.", "authors": ["Jonathan Martin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/us/politics/26dc-repubs/26dc-repubs-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
