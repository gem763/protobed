Instead, it was wasted.\u2019\n\nDoctor jailed for life for beating his mother to death with a chisel\n\nMore than a quarter of a million pounds was spent on Facebook adverts between September 8 and September 14, according to figures from the social network last month.\n\nThe campaign also included billboards telling people \u2018get ready, October 31, here we come\u2019 and messaging on bus stops.\n\nThe Cabinet Office did not provide a figure for the cost of the advertising campaign when asked.\n\nThe PM was compelled to ask Brussels for an extension to Article 50 by the Benn Act, after he failed to get a deal approved by Parliament.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
