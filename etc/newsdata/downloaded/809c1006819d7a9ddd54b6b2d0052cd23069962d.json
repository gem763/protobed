Bless his cotton socks, the Irish contingent of One Direction exudes a \u201cjust happy to be here\u201d energy, and honestly I wish him all the success in the world. Including in the romance department, which is why I\u2019m obsessed with the current Selena Gomez related rumours doing the rounds.\n\nThat\u2019s right, there are folks that firmly believe these two are a Thing, and I couldn\u2019t be more here for it if I tried. I mean, it\u2019s pretty believable considering Selena hasn\u2019t dated anyone publicly since she split from The Weeknd a coupla years back and Niall has been single since dating Hailee Steinfeld last year.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s HISTORY. For a bit of back story, Niall has long been a vocal admirer of Sel\u2019s. In fact, as someone with an encyclopaedic knowledge of One Direction\u2019s 2015 appearance on James Corden\u2018s Carpool Karaoke, I recall that during a round of Fuck / Marry / Kill Niall said he\u2019d \u201cmarry Gomez\u201d. Bless.\n\nAround the same time, Sel was flat-out asked by Entertainment Tonight if the pair was dating and she literally screamed: \u201cOh my god! No. I love him, I always have. He\u2019s amazing.\u201d Which was a nice if not quite damning response to the whole thing. But the rumours have been reignited this week again, twice.\n\nREAD MORE Gang Of Youths Have Gone At Niall Horan Over Suspiciously Similar Album Art\n\nThe first instance was 5 days ago when the pair\u2019s mutual friend Courtney Lopez posted this pic from last Thursday US time which featured the pair looking somewhat cosy:\n\nYES WE SEE THAT HAND NIALL.\n\nThen the pair took to Instagram stories to share these cute posts about each other:\n\nAnd:\n\nThe pair also had a little house visit, with Selena snapped heading into Niall\u2019s house with fruit salad and ice cream (I\u2019m telling you, WHOLESOME). While E! News boringly published some quotes from a source saying \u201cSelena and Niall are not dating and have been hanging out as friends\u201d, Twitter is having none of it and is predictably shipping Nelena / Niallena (?!) hard.\n\nselena and niall, that's it that's the tweet pic.twitter.com/HbhigWPYuE \u2014 mire (@gomezdrxgons) October 4, 2019\n\nSelena arriving at Niall's house\n\nOmg \u2728???? pic.twitter.com/GOS3XdTQcd \u2014 Larry_isfucking_real????????
