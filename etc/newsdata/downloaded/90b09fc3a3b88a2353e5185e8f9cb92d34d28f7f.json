Fonda's visit to North Vietnam in 1972 drew fierce backlash that persists today: She was dubbed \"Hanoi Jane\" and a traitor.\n\n\"I'm naive and I make mistakes,\" Fonda said in the 2018 HBO documentary \"Jane Fonda in Five Acts.\" Of the infamous photo that showed her sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun, she says: \"It was a betrayal. \u2026 I will go to my grave regretting that.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Fonda has been arrested, either.\n\nAccording to her website, she was arrested for \"drug smuggling\" at the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in 1970.\n\n\"I was handcuffed and put in the Cleveland Jail, which is when the mug shot was taken,\" she writes. \"I was released on bond and months later, after every pill had been tested in a lab (with taxpayers money!) The charges were dismissed and there were a few paragraphs hidden in the back of papers that they were vitamins, not drugs.\"\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney\n\nMore: Prince Harry says during royal tour of Africa: 'No one can deny science' on climate change\n\nStars vocal about their health struggles: Selma Blair, Kim Kardashian, Demi Lovato, more\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/11/jane-fonda-arrested-climate-change-protest-capitol-hill/3944666002/", "description": "Jane Fonda was arrested in Washington, D.C.
