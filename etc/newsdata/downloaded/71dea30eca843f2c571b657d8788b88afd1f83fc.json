Horowitz\u2019s old colleague Comey claimed, despite records strongly suggesting otherwise, that he was not told for weeks about an obvious hot potato: the discovery of new emails in the Hillary Clinton investigation.\n\nHorowitz also accepted Comey\u2019s word that his leaking was not classified. A Comey memo of a conversation with President Trump was deemed merely sensitive \u2013 even though it concerned the FBI's counterintelligence investigation of the president\u2019s national security adviser.\n\nHorowitz took Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch\u2019s word for it on the infamous Phoenix tarmac meeting . He didn\u2019t interview members of the ex-President and Attorney General\u2019s security details about what the powerful pair discussed just before Lynch\u2019s DoJ was to rule on Hillary\u2019s emails.\n\nHorowitz took Andrew McCabe at his word too . The ex-FBI No. 2 testified that during the Clinton email probe, he knew nothing about a big cash infusion into his wife\u2019s state senate run arranged by a longtime Clinton ally, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe \u2013 despite evidence McCabe met with the governor.\n\nHorowitz didn\u2019t demand Page and Strzok\u2019s private emails . Anti-Trump FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked and communicated while away from government-authorized devices in an apparent Hillary Clinton-like violation of department rules.\n\nHorowitz and his wife have supported Democrats. He worked on liberal Barney Frank\u2019s campaign while in college and in 2010 donated to Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, an ex-colleague now running for President who has slammed President Trump for his coziness with Vladimir Putin. Alexandra Kauffman Horowitz is a former Democratic activist and now a Washington producer for CNN.\n\nAssessing Horowitz\u2019s work, Chris Swecker, a 24-year investigative veteran of the FBI, said, \u201cI see a pattern of him pulling up short and trying to be a bit of a statesman instead of making the hard calls.\u201d Tom Fitton, president of the watchdog group Judicial Watch, said the IG has exposed some critical facts, but his reports are \u201ccover-ups at the same time.\u201d\n\nRead Full Article\n\nWhistlegate Reveals Some Very Chatty Minders of State Secrets\n\nRealClearInvestigations\n\nA CIA analyst\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint against President Trump shows a flouting of rules within the government against intelligence-sharing beyond the need to know, Eric Felten reports for RealClearInvestigations. And that could pose risks to national security.\n\nFelten reports:\n\nT he whistleblower and his sources, however justified they felt, almost certainly violated regulations aimed at preserving state secrets, legal experts say.\n\nThe basic rule is two-fold: 1) you don\u2019t share classified information with someone lacking proper clearance; and 2) you don\u2019t share with someone who doesn\u2019t have an official need to know the information.\n\nThe CIA analyst behind the complaint didn\u2019t have sufficient clearance or a need to know. By his own admission, he relied on anonymous \"officials\" who did, not his own firsthand knowledge.\n\nIf the \"whistleblower\" had had clearance, he could have accessed the intelligence himself, including the rough transcript of a call between Trump and the Ukrainian President at the center of the uproar.\n\nComing by information in the normal course of business, as the CIA analyst claims, doesn't absolve the parties of over-sharing outside of one's level of clearance.\n\nThe issue isn't just intelligence officials' disdain for President Trump; there has been a longstanding failure to rein in the intelligence community\u2019s rumor mill.\n\nThis talking out of school was made almost inevitable by the nation's recent experience with terrorism.\n\nTough restrictions imposed after some of the biggest spy breaches in U.S. history fell by the wayside after 9/11, when government officials concluded that closer communication among agencies might have helped prevent the attacks.\n\nThe government has been hesitant to punish top officials who share information, among them former FBI Director James Comey .\n\n\"What is truly endangered now is the ability to keep anything secret,\u201d says one intelligence scholar.\n\nWhat Is the FISA Spy Court and Why Do People Keep Bashing It?\n\nRealClearInvestigations\n\nWhat if the irregularities in the court applications for surveillance of ex-Trump adviser Carter Page were not so irregular -- and Americans are routinely being wiretapped on flimsy national security pretexts? That's the provocative question Tim Cavanaugh poses in RealClearInvestigations as he unpacks the opaque workings of the FISA spy court \u2013 the focus of a highly anticipated Justice Department Inspector General's report on how the FBI ever got the green light to spy on Page. Cavanaugh reports:\n\nCritics call the court a rubber-stamp body, pointing to its history of approving about 98% of the roughly 1,600 to 1,700 spy applications it receives each year.\n\nAlthough hundreds of warrants are approved each year, the public becomes aware of them only \u201c10 or 20 times a year\" when the government has to disclose FISA material used in court, an ACLU lawyer says.\n\nA lot of the court's critics are not Trump partisans but libertarians and stalwarts of the left like the American Civil Liberties Union and New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThey argue that it is too secretive and cozy with government authorities.\n\nThe court has also been accused of allowing \u201cmission creep,\u201d letting government agents rely more and more on FISA orders for surveillance rather than more appropriate, and restrictive, Title III criminal warrants.\n\nUnlike criminal wiretap orders, FISA orders allow the government to cast a wide net, empowering agents to collect communications from anyone in contact with the target as well as people communicating with those contacts.\n\nThe 11 judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, appointed to staggered 7-year terms, appear to have a heavy workload: an average of over 30 applications per week. T he first Page application ran 66 pages, including footnotes.\n\nBut the judges have legal staff as liaisons with government lawyers to move things along -- out of public view.\n\nCourt d efenders argue that things were even worse before : S pying on U.S. citizens was not subject to any judicial scrutiny at all until the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 .\n\nThe Trump Investigations: Top Articles\n\nTrump Team's Texts Detail Pressure on Ukraine, Daily Beast\n\nTrump Publicly Urges China to Investigate the Bidens, New York Times\n\nIntel Chair Schiff Got Ukraine Claims Before Inspector General, New York Times\n\nUkraine Sources Detail Efforts Against Biden, Guardian\n\nOnce-Secret Memos Cast Doubt on Joe Biden's Ukraine Story, The Hill\n\nHunter Biden: The Timeline, National Review\n\nBarr Asked Foreign Officials to Aid Inquiry of FBI, CIA, 2016, Washington Post\n\nDems Probe Ties of Trump, Giuliani, Sam Kislin, Ukraine, Daily Beast\n\nTrump Hotel Mystery: Reservations Followed by Empty Rooms, Politico\n\nNew Hearsay Whistleblower vs. Trump ... From Inside IRS, Washington Post\n\nOther Noteworthy Articles and Series\n\nFeds Dramatically Expand Exposure to Risky Mortgages\n\nWashington Post\n\nIt\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 3br/2ba rvr vu all over again. The federal government has dramatically expanded its exposure to risky mortgages, as federal officials over the past four years took steps that cleared the way for companies to issue loans that many borrowers might not be able to repay. Now, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration guarantee almost $7 trillion in mortgage-related debt, 33 percent more than before the housing crisis. Because these entities are run or backstopped by the U.S. government, a large increase in loan defaults could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. This risk is the direct result of pressure from the lending industry, consumer groups and political appointees, who clamored for the government to intervene when homeownership rates fell several years ago. Numerous government officials, starting in the Obama administration, obliged, mistakenly expecting that the private market would ultimately take over.\n\nHundreds off Accused Priests Living With No Oversight\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNearly 1,700 priests and other clergy members that the Roman Catholic Church considers credibly accused of child sexual abuse are living under the radar with little to no oversight from religious authorities or law enforcement, decades after the first wave of the church abuse scandal roiled U.S. dioceses, an Associated Press investigation has found. Some among these priests, deacons, monks and lay people now teach middle-school math. They counsel survivors of sexual assault. They work as nurses and volunteer at nonprofits aimed at helping at-risk kids. They live next to playgrounds and day care centers. They foster and care for children. And in their time since leaving the church, dozens have committed crimes, including sexual assault and possessing child pornography.\n\nInternet Full of Images of Child Sexual Abuse\n\nNew York Times\n\nIn 2008, lawmakers, the tech industry and many Americans were horrified by the fact that some one million images depicting child sexual abuse could be found on the internet. But despite the passage of landmark legislation that year, the problem has proliferated. Technology companies reported a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse last year. An investigation by The New York Times found an insatiable criminal underworld that had exploited the flawed and insufficient efforts to contain it. The Justice Department, given a major role by Congress, neglected even to write mandatory monitoring reports, nor did it appoint a senior executive-level official to lead a crackdown. And the group tasked with serving as a federal clearinghouse for the imagery \u2014 the go-between for the tech companies and the authorities \u2014 was ill equipped for the expanding demands.\n\nStory of Khashoggi's Murder, and How the World Looked Away\n\nInsider\n\nOne year ago the Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never walked out. In the months that followed the facts of his disappearance and murder would emerge in fragments: an international high-tech spy game, a diabolical plot, a gruesome killing, and a preposterous cover-up reaching the highest levels of the Saudi government, aided by the indifference and obstinacy of the White House. Eventually those fragments came to comprise a macabre mosaic. This article, illustrated by Chris Koehler and told as a nonfiction narrative by author Evan Ratliff, draws on the Post\u2019s reporting, a UN report on the murder, hundreds of news accounts, video interviews and public testimony to detail what is known about Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nMeet the Millionaires Helping to Pay for Climate Protests\n\nNew York Times\n\nWashington residents snarled in the traffic jams created last month by climate change protesters might have asked themselves: \u201cWho helps pays for this activism?\u201d The answer is scions of some of America\u2019s most famous families \u2013 including Rory Kennedy, daughter of Senator Robert Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy; and Aileen Getty, a granddaughter of the oil magnate Jean Paul Getty. They are among the founders the Climate Emergency Fund \u2013 a nonprofit founded in July by wealthy donors who have long supported organizations like the Sierra Club and the National Resources Defense Council, but have now \u201cconcluded that these groups were taking a too-gradual approach to the fight against climate change and that the crisis demanded greater urgency.\u201d A separate story from Smithsonian highlights a study of 91 well-financed think tanks and advocacy groups that allegedly work to deny the science regarding climate change.\n\nEat Up: Scientists Report Red Meat May Not Be a Danger\n\nNew York Times\n\nDrop that Impossible Whopper. Here, have a Triple Bacon Cheeseburger. At a time when climate alarmists forecast imminent global doom owing in part to flatulent cows, a new study challenges the longtime advice from public health officials that we should limit consumption of red meat and processed meats. If there are health benefits from eating less beef and pork, they are small. Already the findings have been met with fierce criticism from elite public health researchers. And the Wall Street Journal editorial board thinks it knows why: \"Climate politics is now infecting even nutritional science.\"", "description": "RealClearInvestigations' Picks of the Week Sept. 29 to Oct. 5, 2019\nFeatured Investigations: 'Straight Shooter' Justice Dept.
