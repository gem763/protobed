This could mean offering new subsidies and grants for carbon capture technologies and projects, or demanding that companies that supply fossil fuels and agriculture products offset a percentage of their carbon emissions by investing in greenhouse gas removal.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThis report presents a variety of different options for consideration, and we will look closely at its findings.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the importance and urgency of taking action right across the economy to deliver on our world-leading net-zero target, including by developing our approach to greenhouse gas removal technology.\u201d\n\nOn average, the report estimates that the UK may need between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn a year in 2030 to remove greenhouse gas emissions from the air, rising to between \u00a36bn and \u00a320bn by 2050.\n\nThe most expensive projects would involve technology that can absorb carbon dioxide from the air. This could remove about 25m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year at a cost between \u00a3160 and \u00a3470 a tonne.\n\nThe cheapest options include restoring natural habits, which could absorb 5m tonnes of carbon from the air every year at a cost of between \u00a38 and \u00a378 a tonne.\n\nThe report even suggests supporting \u201cenhanced weathering\u201d, a relatively new approach to carbon removal in which fields are spread with ground-up silicate rocks, such as basalt, to increase the soil\u2019s natural rate of carbon absorption. This could remove 15m tonnes of carbon from the air every year, but the cost of this process is uncertain at between \u00a339 and \u00a3390 a tonne.\n\nThe analysts expect large-scale greenhouse gas removal to rely on projects that use bioenergy alongside carbon capture technology, known as BECCS, as well as projects that capture carbon directly from the air, or DACCS.\n\nBECCS technology is being used on a small-scale at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire, where some of the coal-burning power units have been converted to run on biomass.\n\nBiomass is considered by the UK and EU governments to be carbon-neutral because the pellets are made from sustainably farmed trees which absorb carbon emissions while they grow.\n\nDrax is using carbon capture technology at the power station to trap one tonne of carbon emissions a day from burning the pellets.\n\nHowever, the project has attracted criticism from campaigners who question whether biomass, which Drax imports from the US, should be considered a renewable energy source. Almost 800 scientists wrote to the EU government last year to call for biomass to be stripped of its carbon-neutral status.", "description": "Report estimates up to \u00a320bn a year in investment needed to build net-zero carbon economy", "authors": ["Jillian Ambrose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d98b2f76d945ec37b881e8018998da39d4319075/0_316_4758_2856/master/4758.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4e84baaca90f34ae0160e6a1d876d128", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
