Painful. We\u2019re beyond gutted Catherine and Johannes have left but Mike danced well and deserves his spot,' Emily tweeted. 'As a viewer since the start I get opinion but this level of abuse is shocking. He\u2019s just a contestant and giving his all!'\n\nOne viewer kindly tweeted: '@ShirleyBallas is a world renowned judge and former world champion. I chose to accept her decision over armchair viewers. @mikebreakfast impressed me and I LOVE his attitude!'\n\nTo which Mike replied: 'Thanks Caroline. I totally agree. I always accept the decision of the judges and advice or when I play football the referee. The judges on @bbcstrictly are the best in the world!'\n\nThe barrage of abuse endured by the BBC Breakfast host including tweets such as: 'That strictly decision was the biggest fix ever, just because Mike is a BBC employee.'\n\nAttack: The news anchor, 53, was told to 'f**k off' by vicious viewers of the ballroom show, with others branding it 'a fix', given that Mike is a BBC employee [pictured with pro partner Katya Jones]\n\nOut: Catherine and Johannes Radebe were sent home on Sunday night's edition of Strictly\n\nAnother posted: 'F**k this #Strictly result! if Shirley and Craig thought Mike stomping around the floor was better than Catherine they are deluded! Shirley has hated Catherine since the start and had it in for her. Shirley needs her head testing! ITS A FIX - Mike can p**s off and so can Katya!'\n\nSomeone else raged: 'Have the judges been told to keep the BBC personality in? Catherine has been good each week, certainly better than Mike and had more potential. Poor and unfair decision in my opinion!'\n\n'What a fix!! MIKE BUSHELL?! What a load of s***e! You've ruined this year's competition for thousands of people including me and my mother!'\n\n'Unbelievable flat footed cardboard cutout Mike Bushell survives Strictly Come Dancing dance off against Catherine Tyldesly. Can only assume it\u2019s a fix up by BBC to protect their sports presenter,' someone else wrote, as someone else agreed: 'Is this Strictly Come Dancing or the Mike Bushell Show? Clearly working for the BBC gives you a leg up!'\n\n'I mean ok Mike seems like a nice fella but f**k off!' someone else posted.\n\nAnother wrote: 'F**k off, this is a piece of s**t, Mike Bushell works for the BBC, this is an absolute fix!'\n\nAnother penned: 'Told you it was a shocker like what the actual f**k picking Mike to stay who conveniently works for the (BBC) over Catherine who was clearly the better dancer there is something fishy going on if you ask me!'\n\n'I know it\u2019s about the dance in the dance off, but.... WHAT THE ACTUAL F**K?! Mike has been in the bottom two for weeks and is this years comedy celeb. He shouldn\u2019t be in the show any longer IMO. He should\u2019ve gone, not Cath. Been fuming about this since this morning,' ranted someone else.\n\nActress Catherine was the fifth contestant to be eliminated from the series alongside her ballroom partner Johannes Radebe.\n\nThey had to perform their Cha Cha once again at the end of the show's Halloween Week, after scraping the bottom of the leaderboard with a score of 24 out of a possible 40.\n\nJudge Shirley Ballas cast the deciding vote that sent her home, but Catherine remained positive, as she said of Johannes: 'He\u2019s like my best friend\u2026 Just the opportunity to work with amazing people and get critiqued off amazing people.\n\n'I never thought I\u2019d say this, I\u2019m going to keep it up because I fell in love with it! I\u2019ve loved every second, this man has changed my life!'\n\nSpeaking to host Tess Daly, Johannes said: 'The beautiful thing is that I need to thank Strictly Come Dancing for the opportunity\u2026\n\n'Most of all, I want to say thank you to this woman. She has been a light for me. Thank you for accepting me for who I am and for showing me joy every day.'\n\nBottom two: The pair were eliminated after a dance-off against Mike and Katya\n\nThis weekend, the 11 remaining celebrity couples took to the dance floor to perform an array of live glittering ballroom and Latin routines for Halloween Week.\n\nMike and Katya were third from bottom on the leaderboard, after performing the Tango to Gwen Stefani's hit What You Waiting For, landing them a score of just 26.\n\nHowever, neither Mike nor Catherine were at the very bottom of the leaderboard this week: Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer's Samba to the Backstreet Boys' Everybody (Backstreet\u2019s Back) earned them 23 points out of 40.\n\nAfter the judges\u2019 scores were combined with the results of the viewers\u2019 votes, it was Catherine and Mike who were left to face each other.\n\nEmotional farewell: Fellow contestants hugged the pair as they said their goodbyes at the end of the episode, which rounded out the popular BBC show's Halloween Week\n\nFollowing their dances for survival, the judges gave their verdicts, with Craig Revel Horwood choosing to save Mike and Katya, as he explained: 'One couple for me really stepped it up a notch. The couple I\u2019d like to save is Mike and Katya.'\n\nMotsi Mabuse chose to save Catherine and Johannes, saying: 'I felt a strong performance, stronger body actions, stronger leg actions.'\n\nNext up was Bruno Tonioili, who said: 'It\u2019s hard because you\u2019ve both done very, very well, but purely based on tonight I have to save the couple that got me tingling a little bit more and I have to save Catherine and Johannes.'\n\nLeft with the deciding vote, head judge Shirley opined: 'Well, I thought both couples really stepped it up a notch and this is always the most difficult decision for me.\n\nWow! Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice earned the highest score of the series with their 'phenomenal' foxtrot on Saturday\n\n'But based on a good focus, difficult content, with some really beautiful footwork in there with stronger technical skills for me, cleaner and polished. I\u2019m going to save Mike and Katya.'\n\nOn Saturday night, Michelle Visage and her professional partner Giovanni Pernice topped the leaderboard during the spooky Halloween special.\n\nThe RuPaul's Drag Race judge impressed with a Gothic foxtrot to the Addams Family theme tune by Vic Mizzy, which earned them three tens to get 39 points at the end of the show.\n\nGiovanni's girlfriend Ashley Roberts supported the duo from the audience, cheering them on as Shirley dubbed their performance 'phenomenal'.\n\nDelighted: Ashley Roberts watched the pair from the sidelines and cheered them on ecstatically after their impressive dance was over\n\nShe said: 'Lovely musicality. It was my favourite number so far.'\n\nBruno added: 'You managed to combine the classic, the gothic and the sassy. The characterisation was so perfect.'\n\nEver the critic, Craig struggled to find anything negative in the dance, but eventually said: 'I was desperately looking for something wrong with it and I actually found one little thing - a little bit of gapping. I absolutely loved it. It was gorgeous.'\n\nWhile Motsi branded the dance 'sensational', she added: 'My little dancing heart was very very happy because I got all those technical bits. I got everything I wanted. That was out of this world.'", "description": "Mike Bushell and his wife Emily have hit back at trolls on Twitter who have slammed the BBC Breakfast presenter after he was saved on Strictly Come Dancing at the weekend.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/09/20271582-0-image-a-17_1572253612667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
