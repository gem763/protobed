WeWork had planned to begin making its pitch to investors in a roadshow as soon as this week.\n\nIn January, SoftBank made its last investment in WeWork, renamed the We Co., at a valuation of $47 billion. The company was more recently expected to be valued at only about $15 billion in a listing and perhaps even less, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nThe decision will at least temporarily sideline an important source of capital for the money-losing business and could threaten a $6 billion credit financing that was contingent on a successful offering.\n\nThe delay also adds another sour note to a medley of high-profile but frequently disappointing IPOs this year. The offering was expected to have been the biggest after Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s $8.1 billion listing and ahead of Avantor Inc.\u2019s $2.9 billion IPO and the $2.34 offering by Uber\u2019s ride-hailing rival Lyft Inc. Of those three, only Avantor is trading above its offer price.\n\nWeWork\u2019s likely delay was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWeWork has become an extreme example of the excesses afforded to technology entrepreneurs in the era of unicorns -- startups valued at $1 billion or more. Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, was able to raise billions of dollars at astronomical valuations and spend freely, while retaining effective control over operations through special classes of stock.\n\nIn an effort to keep its IPO on track, WeWork last week took steps to limit Neumann\u2019s control of the company after an IPO, as well as other measures to improve its corporate governance.\n\nMore must-read stories from Fortune:\n\n\u2014The bull and bear case for investing in Apple before the debut of its streaming service\n\n\u2014Are we near a recession?
