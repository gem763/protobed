He said the most important reason he\u2019s jumping in the ring is because of the \u201cnation\u2019s debt, deficits, and spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a storm coming that we are neither talking about nor preparing for given that we, as a country, are more financially vulnerable than we have ever been since our Nation\u2019s start and the Civil War,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe are on a collision course with financial reality. We need to act now.\u201d\n\nTrump blasted his decision to enter the race, recalling Sanford's infamous affair.\n\n\"When the former Governor of the Great State of South Carolina, @MarkSanford, was reported missing, only to then say he was away hiking on the Appalachian Trail, then was found in Argentina with his Flaming Dancer friend, it sounded like his political career was over. It was,\u2026 but then he ran for Congress and won, only to lose his re-elect after I Tweeted my endorsement, on Election Day, for his opponent. But now take heart, he is back, and running for President of the United States. The Three Stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go!\u201d\n\nWhen the former Governor of the Great State of South Carolina, @MarkSanford, was reported missing, only to then say he was away hiking on the Appalachian Trail, then was found in Argentina with his Flaming Dancer friend, it sounded like his political career was over.

It\u2019s something I\u2019ve apologized extensively for.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Sanford, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (R) and former Rep.
