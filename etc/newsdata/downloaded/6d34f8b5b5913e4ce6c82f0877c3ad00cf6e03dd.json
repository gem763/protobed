Furthermore, the Chinese Basketball Association president is currently Yao Ming, who played with the Rockets from 2002 to 2011. Yao\u2019s NBA success made the Rockets a favourite among Chinese fans.\n\nRockets' manager Daryl Morey ignited controversy on Friday by re-tweeting an image which was captioned: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHe deleted the tweet, and the team\u2019s owner, Tillman Fertitta, quickly distanced the team from Mr Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nMr Morey - one of the league\u2019s most visible officials on social media, with over 200,000 followers \u2013 then backtracked, stating: \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event\u201d and emphasising that his words were \u201cmy own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d", "description": "China has reacted with fury after the general manager of basketball team Houston Rockets tweeted his support for the protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander", "Judith Woods", "Mark Almond"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/china-watch/china-watch-migration/yao-ming-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwZwVSIA7rSIkPn18jgFKEo0.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
