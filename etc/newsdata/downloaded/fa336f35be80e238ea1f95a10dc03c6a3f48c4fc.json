(The Lawrenceville School student handbook stipulates that students must report in person to the \u201cduty master\u201d each night before bed.)\n\nAbout an hour later, a 14-year-old boy was similarly awakened by hands touching his body, and he found Brown \u201ccrouching partially under the side of his bed,\u201d the affidavit alleges. Though Brown reportedly left the room after the student confronted him, the teen told police that he peered back inside a short time later.\n\nThe students, who were reportedly in a group Snapchat message together, relayed their similar experiences and then told campus security, who notified police.\n\nBrown has since been fired, NJ.com reported. Prosecutors said he will remain in jail until a Thursday morning detention hearing.", "description": "Dominic Brown, a 23-year-old history teacher at The Lawrenceville School, was charged with endangering the welfare of a child and aggravated criminal sexual contact.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1186,w_2109,x_1632,y_436/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570643249/GettyImages-141971737_noaj6s", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
