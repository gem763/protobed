The simple truth is, that those are the same issues that the president raised with President Zelensky during that call.\"\n\nPence lashed out against Democrats in the House of Representatives who have launched an impeachment inquiry to examine the extent of Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\"This is just more of the same of what we've seen from Democrats over the last two and a half years,\" he said. \"These endless investigations should end in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nAsked about his message to voters who are troubled that Trump has asked a foreign leader to investigate a domestic political foe, Pence told The Arizona Republic's political podcast, The Gaggle, that the Bidens' involvement in Ukraine \"represents an issue the American people are entitled to know more about and to get to the bottom of and get to the facts of.\"\n\nCLOSE Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday addressed his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
