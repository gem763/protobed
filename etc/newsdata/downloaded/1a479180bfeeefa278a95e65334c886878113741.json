It would be ridiculous and absurd to hide the name of any ethnic group,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Rigney added that the company has fixed the issue, and will be spending \"the next few weeks\" reviewing and updating its banned words and phrases list.\n\nThe BBC has contacted developer Riot Games and publisher Tencent for comment.\n\nUighurs are mostly based in China's Xinjiang province, where they make up around 45% of the population. Xinjiang is officially designated as an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south.\n\nHuman rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, submitted reports to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination this year, documenting claims of mass imprisonment in camps, where inmates are forced to swear loyalty to China's President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe World Uighur Congress said in a recent report that detainees are held indefinitely without charge, and forced to shout Communist Party slogans.\n\nIt's the latest in a series of complaints from League of Legends users this year, after players in Iran reported being blocked from playing the game due to US sanctions against the country.\n\nGamers shared their experiences in League of Legends' online forums, pleading with the US government to rethink extending its trade sanctions to gamers.", "description": "The popular online multi-player game is facing backlash from users.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F6F5/production/_109312236__109273299_lol3-gameplay.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
