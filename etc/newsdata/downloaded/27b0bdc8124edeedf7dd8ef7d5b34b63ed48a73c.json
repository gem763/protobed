It's happened in the United States in response to tenant farmers back in 1845, and in the 20th Century in response to the Klu Klux Klan in the US.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nOn Friday, Hong Kong Leader Carrie Lam announced an immediate city-wide ban on protesters wearing face masks.\n\nShe said it had to be done, because most of the protesters vandalizing the city were doing it with their faces covered. The ability to hide their identity meant protesters could evade the law and act more daring, she said.\n\nProtesters wear the masks because they fear reprisal from China's ever-ubiquitous surveillance of dissidents, aided by the government's widespread use of facial recognition technology.\n\nThe ban was passed under an emergency law from the colonial era. It's the first time it's been used since 1967, and it was originally passed to stop a seamen's strike in 1922.\n\nBanning masked protesters has also happened in the US, Europe, and Russia in the last two centuries.\n\nHere are some of the places where masks or face coverings are banned in public.", "description": "Hong Kong is not the first place to bar protesters from wearing masks.
