(AP) - Washington state health officials have warned hundreds of trailer park residents to boil water before using it amid a water contamination issue.\n\nThe Spokesman-Review reports that Pinecroft Mobile Home Park residents have had a boil order on their water since E. coli was detected in July.\n\nState health officials have required management to fix the water system, despite recent water tests returning clear of the bacteria.\n\nPinecroft officials say the source of the contamination has not been identified, but could be due to an old well, a poorly constructed well and issues with nearby septic systems.\n\nOfficials say the Spokane Valley trailer park has announced plans to build a chlorine treatment system, but must complete an approval process before construction.\n\nOfficials say a fix may not come until next summer.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington state health officials have warned hundreds of trailer park residents to boil water before using it amid a water contamination issue.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
