That is how it stands now, after the Washington Nationals won twice in Houston, then squandered nearly all of their chances at home on Friday in a 4-1 loss to the Astros in Game 3.\n\nOne man on the field at Nationals Park during batting practice could relate. Joe Torre, the league\u2019s chief baseball officer, managed the Yankees in 1996, a pivot point in World Series history. The Yankees lost the first two games at home to the Atlanta Braves, the reigning champions. But Torre had the pitcher he wanted for Game 3.\n\n\u201cA 2-1 Series is a whole lot different than 3-0,\u201d Torre said. \u201cWhat I did in \u201996 was have David Cone pitch Game 3. I had called him in and explained why. I said, \u2018You\u2019re the only one that ever pitched down there in Atlanta, and I didn\u2019t want people getting spooked by the launching pad.\u2019 I think that was a big, big difference for us.\u201d\n\nCone was not his sharpest (he walked four and struck out three) but he lasted six innings, allowed just one run, and the Yankees won by three. They became the third and last team to win the World Series after starting 0-2 at home.", "description": "Greinke battled the Nationals for nearly five innings to help Houston avoid a three-game deficit, giving the Astros new life in Washington.", "authors": ["Tyler Kepner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/sports/26kepner-series/26kepner-series-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
