He would have to decide whether to abide by a law that demands he accept any Brexit delay offered by the EU or somehow leave without a deal.\n\nVictory, an imperfect indicator of support for Johnson\u2019s deal, would give opponents in parliament another chance to ambush the government with amendments that could wreck Johnson\u2019s plans by demanding a much closer post-Brexit relationship with the EU.\n\nThe pound was flat at $1.2946 in London trading. Foreign exchange markets now price in Britain either leaving with a deal or delaying Brexit, or possibly both.\n\nJohnson said the best way to avoid a no-deal Brexit would be to approve his Brexit legislation, adding that the country was tired of the discussion in parliament.\n\nBREXIT IN PLAY\n\nMore than three years since the United Kingdom voted 52% to 48% to leave the European Union, the Brexit crisis is straining Britain\u2019s political and constitution system to the breaking point.\n\nJohnson confounded his opponents by winning a Brexit deal from the EU on Thursday, though he was forced by his opponents - reluctantly and with a mere unsigned photocopy - to ask for a Brexit delay on Saturday. House of Commons speaker John Bercow refused a vote on his deal on Monday.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons as parliament debates on Withdrawal Agreement bill, in London, Britain, October 22, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video. Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\nIf Johnson is defeated on Tuesday, much will depend on how the EU plays yet another Brexit quandary.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said he was discussing the request for a Brexit delay with the leaders of the other 27 member states and would make a decision \u201cin the coming days\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that we should treat the British request for an extension in all seriousness,\u201d Tusk told lawmakers in the Strasbourg assembly of the European Union parliament. \u201cA no-deal Brexit will never be our decision\u201d, he said to applause from lawmakers.\n\nIn a sign of the frustration in Brussels, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Brexit was a waste of time and energy and that the European Parliament could only approve Johnson\u2019s deal after the British parliament.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage told the EU parliament that another delay was on the cards.\n\nBehind the daily Brexit combat in parliament, the courts and at late-night EU summits, a much bigger game is being played over whether Brexit will happen at all.\n\nJohnson faces legislative booby traps at every juncture, but the opponents of Brexit are also deeply divided - one of the main reasons their campaign to \u201cRemain\u201d failed in the 2016 referendum.\n\nStill, Johnson is asking a divided parliament where he has no majority to approve in just three days one of the most important pieces of legislation in recent British history.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nThe so-called WAB (Withdrawal Agreement Bill) will have less time for debate in the House of Commons than a law to ban the use of wild animals in circuses, according to the Institute for Government.\n\nPrevious bills to implement major European treaties have taken 10 to 40 days to get through parliament. Government ministers said parliament has enough time to discuss every intricacy of Brexit.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party will vote against both WAB and the timetable, The Times\u2019s political editor said. The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party are also likely oppose both, a UTV reporter said.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Tuesday that if it delayed his Brexit legislation he would abandon his attempt to ratify the deal to leave the European Union and push for an election instead.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443757277&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L170", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
