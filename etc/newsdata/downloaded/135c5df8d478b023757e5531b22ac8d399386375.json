(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Randy Dobnak allowed one hit in six sparkling innings, and Luis Arraez and Eddie Rosario homered to lead Minnesota to a 5-1 win over Detroit that put the Twins on the cusp of an AL Central title Wednesday night.\n\nWith the victory, Minnesota clinched at least a tie for the division - and the Twins had a chance to wrap up the title outright if Cleveland lost to the Chicago White Sox later Wednesday.\n\nDobnak (2-1) allowed no scoring after an unearned run in the first. Arraez hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Drew VerHagen (4-3), who had combined with Daniel Norris to shut out the Twins until then. Nelson Cruz added an RBI single in the eighth, and Rosario's two-run shot that inning made it 5-1.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMinnesota (98-60) is on the verge of winning its first AL Central title since 2010 and has its highest victory total since the 1970 team also won 98 games. The Tigers (46-111) are assured of baseball's worst record and the No. 1 pick in next year's draft.\n\nMiguel Cabrera lumbered around from first to score the game's first run on Jeimer Candelario's double. The 36-year-old Cabrera, playing for the first time since Friday, was able to slide home just ahead of the relay. Cabrera had reached on an error by shortstop Jorge Polanco.\n\nDaniel Norris went three innings for the Tigers, allowing two hits and striking out five. VerHagen relieved him and pitched 4 1/3 innings.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nTwins: RP Sam Dyson is out for the season after having shoulder surgery Tuesday. ...
