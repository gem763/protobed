Add Interest\n\nThe exchange, provided by another American diplomat, former U.S Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, as part of his closed-door deposition before multiple House committees Thursday, shows what appears to be encrypted text messages he exchanged with two other American diplomats in September regarding aid money President Donald Trump ordered to be held back from Ukraine.\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn the Sept. 9 exchange, obtained by ABC News, the concerns are expressed by Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine. Gordon Sondland, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, responds to Taylor, saying that charge is \"incorrect.\"\n\n\"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelenskiy promised during his campaign,\" Sondland says.\n\nSondland then suggests to the group take the conversations off line, typing, \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the material obtained by ABC News included the full exchange.\n\nAvalon.red via Newscom, FILE\n\nSonland, a hotelier and Republican megadonor, contributed over $1 million to the president\u2019s inaugural committee before eventually being nominated and confirmed to be the United States representative to the European Union, serving since July 2018. He has assisted the effort by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to contact Ukrainian officials about an investigation, according to Giuliani, who says he briefed Sondland and Volker after his meetings.\n\nIn a July 25 call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, President Trump asked the new president to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, prompting an impeachment inquiry in the House.\n\nVolker resigned last Friday as the special envoy for Ukraine. The State Department has previously confirmed that Volker put Giuliani in touch with Zelenskiy's aides at their request, but did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nThe texts came just days before the White House released the military assistance to Ukraine -- almost $400 million from the State Department and Pentagon meant to boost the U.S. partner against Russian aggression. That aid was ordered withheld by the White House a week before the call, according to a senior administration official.\n\nIn a separate thread between Sondland and Volker directly, the two diplomats discussed contacts with Ukrainian officials and requests for them to open an investigation. On Aug. 13, they appear to be drafting language for Ukrainian officials to announce an investigation into \"the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States, especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians.\"\n\n\"I want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future,\" Volker writes, with Sondland responding, \"Perfect. Lets send to Andrey after our call.\"\n\n\"Andrey\" is an apparent reference to Zelenskiy's aide Andrey Yermak, with whom Volker had put Giuliani in contact.\n\n\"Want to know our status on asking them to investigate,\" Volker said on Aug. 15 of contacting Yermak. Two days later, Sondland asks Volker for an update, and Volkers responds, \"I've got nothing. Bill [Taylor] had no info on requesting an investigation -- calling a friend at DOJ (Bruce Schwartz).\"\n\nJohn Rudoff/Sipa USA via AP, FILE\n\nSwartz is the deputy assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice. It's unclear what role he had, if any.\n\nSondland asks, \"Do we still want Ze to give us an unequivocal draft with 2016 and Boresma\" -- which could be a reference to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where Biden's son Hunter was a board member.\n\n\"That's the clear message so far...\" Volker responds. \"I'm hoping we can put something out there that causes him to respond with that.\"\n\nTwo days after that, Sondland says he has spoken to Yermak and \"drove the 'larger issue' home with [him]. Not about just a meeting but the relationship per se.\" There have been questions about whether Trump was withholding a meeting with Zelenskiy in exchange for an investigation of the Biden's.\n\nThe two presidents met the next month during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. During a photo op before the meeting, Zelenskiy told reporters, \"Nobody pushed me.\" Trump jumped in to add, \"In other words, no pressure.\"\n\nTaylor is the latest State Department official to be caught up in this controversy. A career foreign service officer who previously served as ambassador to Ukraine, Taylor has served as the top diplomat in Kyiv since May, when Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was recalled by the administration. Yovanovitch had been smeared by President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani for months as blocking Ukrainian investigations into corruption -- an allegation the State Department at the time called an \"outright fabrication\" that \"does not correspond to reality.\"\n\nBut Trump referred to Yovanovitch as \"bad news\" during the controversial July 25 call.", "description": "In newly disclosed text messages, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine writes to other American diplomats that", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/william-taylor-nc-ps-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
