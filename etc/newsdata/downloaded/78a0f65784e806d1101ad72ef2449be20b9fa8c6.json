The Freshwater Pro is a stop on the World Surf League\u2019s Championship Tour, whose men\u2019s and women\u2019s rankings are used for Olympic qualification.\n\nSlater said it\u2019s not necessarily an advantage that he helped develop the technology used at the Surf Ranch, which was purchased by the WSL in 2016.\n\n\u201cYou would think so, but it\u2019s really not,\u201d Slater said by phone Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hard wave for anyone to figure out, if they surf to their potential. It\u2019s a wave that\u2019s very repetitive. There\u2019s no anomalous stuff. It comes down to skill level and how you perform. That\u2019s the idea behind the technology of the repeatable wave, is everyone has the capability to perform, whereas in the ocean, whoever gets the best wave wins.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Olympic team will include the top two men and top two women in the WSL rankings at the conclusion of the 2019 tour.\n\nSlater of Cocoa Beach, Florida, is ranked 10th overall and fourth among American men. John John Florence of Oahu\u2019s North Shore, ranked No. 5 overall and second among the Americans, is injured and his return is uncertain. If Florence doesn\u2019t return, Slater would need to pass Seth Moniz of Honolulu, who is No. 9 overall, for an Olympic berth. The top American, Kolohe Andino of San Clemente, is No. 3 overall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right there kind of on the bubble,\u201d Slater said. \u201cI\u2019ve only had a couple of events that were good this year, where everything clicked for me. I\u2019ve been underperforming. I just got my worst result at one of my best waves.\u201d\n\nHe finished 17th in Tahiti, an event he\u2019s won five times. He missed most of the 2018 tour while recovering from a broken foot.\n\nSlater, an 11-time WSL champion, said it\u2019s \u201cpretty wild to think about\u201d having a shot at surfing in the Olympics. \u201cI\u2019m 47, would be 48 when the Olympics come around. A lot of people think your prime is in your 20s. I know I\u2019m a better surfer than when I was in my 20s. For me, it\u2019s like the martial arts. You don\u2019t get worse. You might get hurt, but your knowledge is greater the longer you\u2019ve done something.\u201d\n\nSlater said it\u2019s yet to be seen how being in the Olympics might change surfing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about that. Do we belong? Is that our thing? Whatever, surfers didn\u2019t grow up with the dream of being in the Olympics because it wasn\u2019t a reality. Now that will change.\u201d\n\nCompetition for the two U.S. women\u2019s Olympic spots will be tight. American women hold four of the top six spots in the WSL rankings.\n\nCarissa Moore of Honolulu, the defending Freshwater Pro champion, is ranked No. 1 overall.\n\n\u201cIf I can maintain it, that would be awesome,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is very close. The American women\u2019s team is probably the most competitive. There are a lot of girls competing for those two spots. I definitely don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself because anything can happen.\u201d\n\nAfter this weekend, the final WSL contests of 2019 will be in France, Portugal and Hawaii.\n\nLakey Peterson of Santa Barbara is ranked No. 4 overall and No. 2 among American women.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a really nice spot,\u201d she said. \u201cLast year I was No. 1 in the world, and it\u2019s kind of nice not to be there because there\u2019s a lot of pressure that comes with that. But I\u2019m in a place where I can get into that position with a couple of good results.\u201d\n\nPeterson said the Surf Ranch provides \u201ca predictable wave. With surfing, you\u2019ve got to be super adaptable in the ocean because every wave breaks differently. In a wave pool, you know exactly what do. You can plan your run out like a snowboarder in a halfpipe. It\u2019s different in that regard. It brings out the best in the performers for sure.\u201d\n\nMoore said the Surf Ranch is \u201cdefinitely really cool. It\u2019s in middle of the desert and we\u2019re surfing legitimate waves. Not everyone gets to surf this place, so getting to surf here is special.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at https://twitter.com/berniewilson\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kelly Slater claims he has no \"home wave\" advantage at the Surf Ranch he co-founded in California's Central Valley, where many of the world's top surfers will compete Thursday through Saturday in the Freshwater Pro presented by Outerknown, the penultimate U.S. contest before the sport makes its Olympic debut next summer.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
