(Stuart Isett for The Washington Post)\n\nThe Interior Department broke federal spending law when it dipped into national park fees to keep its most popular sites operating during this winter\u2019s partial federal shutdown, the Government Accountability Office concluded Thursday.\n\nIn a 17-page opinion, the GAO found that Trump administration officials violated the law by using fees parks collected under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, which are designed to support visitor services and to fund operations and basic maintenance. This approach violated the lands law as well as the Antideficiency Act, which imposes restrictions on how agencies can redirect money without congressional approval.\n\nAt the time, National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith said the agency needed to divert the funds because keeping parks open but understaffed was no longer tenable.\n\nThe report, which was requested by the two top Democrats on the House and Senate appropriations panels overseeing Interior, used harsh language to describe the administration\u2019s decision to tap entrance fees during the shutdown without explicit authorization from Congress.\n\n\u201cInstead of carrying out the law, Interior improperly imposed its own will,\u201d the opinion states. \u201cInterior cannot select which restraints apply to its appropriations and when these restraints apply.\u201d\n\nThe public watchdog, which noted that the Park Service did not respond to its request for an explanation of its actions, instructed the agency to restore the money it had diverted, report the violation to Congress and outline what actions it had undertaken to prevent another diversion from happening during a future shutdown.\n\nMoney from the fund was spent from Jan. 5 to Jan. 25; the Park Service said Friday that it had used nearly $10.3 million during that period.\n\n\u201cWith this decision, we will consider such violations in the future to be knowing and willful violations of the Act,\u201d the opinion says.\n\nInterior spokeswoman Melissa Brown rejected the GAO\u2019s legal analysis in an email. \u201cWe completely disagree with the GAO\u2019s erroneous opinion regarding our appropriate and lawful use of FLREA funds,\u201d she said. \u201cThe department acted well within its legal authority to clean up restrooms and pick up trash, so the American people could enjoy their national parks.\u201d\n\nRep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) and Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who had requested the opinion, hailed the GAO\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of Interior seems to think the rule of law doesn\u2019t apply to the Trump administration,\u201d said a statement from McCollum, who chairs the House subcommittee on the Interior, environment and related agencies. \u201cThis is a clear violation of the constitution and the basic separation of powers between the executive branch and Congress.\u201d\n\nUdall, her Senate counterpart, said while Interior officials sought to justify the park-fee move, \u201ctheir assurances at the time that their actions were legal have proven false, and there should be consequences for this violation.\u201d", "description": "\u201cInstead of carrying out the law, Interior improperly imposed its own will,\u201d the Government Accountability Office concluded Thursday.", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "September At Pm", "Juliet Eilperin Is The Washington Post'S Senior National Affairs Correspondent", "Covering The Transformation Of Federal Environmental Policy.
