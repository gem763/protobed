(Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBoth main parties in Israel\u2019s do-over election were locked in a dead heat on Wednesday, with more than 90 percent of the vote tallied. The inconclusive result was almost certain to trigger weeks of political infighting, the same uncertainty that set this unusual process in motion in the first place.\n\nAs the results continued to trickle in, both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Israel\u2019s ruling Likud party, and his chief rival, Benny Gantz, head of the centrist secular Blue and White faction, immediately began jockeying for the endorsement of smaller parties whose support could propel either one to a ruling majority of 61 seats in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament. The two parties have an estimated 32 seats each in the new parliament.\n\nAt the center of the stage was the unlikely figure of Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, who in the coming days will offer either Netanyahu or Gantz the first chance at forming a government. Rivlin gave no indication as to which way he would go, but he had already chosen Netanyahu after a similar inconclusive vote in April.\n\nWhen Netanyahu failed to form a coalition after that vote, he triggered this unprecedented second election. Now Likud operatives are even discussing the prospect of a third vote in the months ahead.\n\nIn a statement, Rivlin\u2019s office made clear that a third election was to be avoided at all costs.\n\n\u201cThe president will be guided by the need to form a government in Israel as quickly as possible and to implement the will of the people as expressed in the results of the election, as well as the need to avoid a third general election,\u201d the statement read.\n\nPolitical analysts underscored the complexity of the situation, arguably even more intractable than the aftermath of the April vote, in which Netanyahu had emerged a hair ahead of Gantz.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only that the two parties are the same size, but also the blocs are the same size,\u201d said Emmanuel Navon, a political scientist and foreign policy expert at Tel Aviv University. \u201cThe president will have to get them to form a unity government, and Rivlin can decide to give the job to whoever he wants to, although he must be realistic.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said he is prepared to meet with the leaders of other right-wing parties on Wednesday afternoon, and Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party announced late Tuesday that it had formed a negotiating team.\n\nDressed in sports clothes, Gantz was up early Wednesday morning. \u201cWe are waiting to see the final results,\u201d he said, speaking to reporters outside his home. \u201cIn a day or two we will know, and then we will create a strong and broad unity coalition in the State of Israel.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Gantz had already reached out to Ayman Odeh, leader of the Joint List, the conglomeration of four Arab parties that scored remarkably well in Tuesday\u2019s election, securing 12 seats.\n\n\u201cThe main thing is that Israeli Arabs have made their voices heard, and what they want is to stop a right-wing government headed by Netanyahu,\u201d Odeh said Wednesday in a news conference outside his home in Haifa. \u201cThere is clearly a price for incitement.\u201d\n\n[Israeli election leaves both major parties well short of a majority]\n\nA key feature of Netanyahu\u2019s campaign had been race-baiting Israel\u2019s Arab citizens, accusing them of voter fraud and of trying to \u201ctake over\u201d the country.\n\n\u201cOur direction is very clear,\u201d Odeh said. \u201cWe want to change Netanyahu\u2019s government, but we are not in anyone\u2019s pocket.\u201d\n\n\n\nElection campaign posters for Avigdor Liberman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Ramat Gan, Israel, on Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2019. (Kobi Wolf/Bloomberg)\n\nOdeh said he would consider taking the unprecedented step of heading the country\u2019s formal opposition, something that has never been done by an Arab party in Israel. That would give him the opportunity to meet with high-level visiting dignitaries and gain access to some sensitive security information.\n\nIn a meeting with journalists ahead of the election, Odeh said he would ask whoever turns to him for support to cancel the controversial Nation State Law, move forward with a peace process with the Palestinians and address some of the pressing social issues in Arab society in Israel, including infrastructure projects and stopping home demolitions.\n\nBut whether Odeh\u2019s faction would support Gantz, a former general, was far from a given. His Joint List includes a communist party and members of the Muslim Brotherhood in Israel, both of which would have to agree.\n\n\n\nIsraeli Arab politician Ayman Odeh casts his vote in Haifa, Israel, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019. (Ariel Schalit/AP)\n\nSpeaking outside his home in the Israeli settlement of Nokdim, Avigdor Liberman, Netanyahu\u2019s erstwhile ally and the leader of the secular nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu faction, told Israeli media on Wednesday morning that to avert a democratic crisis, Netanyahu and Gantz have no choice but to form a broad coalition.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame to waste more time; we need to get on this track as soon as possible,\u201d Liberman said. His party has garnered about nine seats, making it key to any coalition.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Central Election Committee said the final vote tally and seat assignments would likely come on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe stakes of a loss for Netanyahu are high: Israel\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, is scheduled to hold a hearing Oct. 3 on three criminal cases in which police have recommended indicting Netanyahu.\n\nRead More\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s election bid and the shadow of apartheid\n\nNetanyahu advises supporters that voting is more important than sex\n\nIn Israeli election, a nation votes but one man could decide\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The second election in five months has failed to produce conclusive results.", "authors": ["James Mcauley", "Foreign Correspondent Focusing On French", "European Politics", "Ruth Eglash", "Reporter Covering Israel", "The Palestinian Territories", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eKloXJdm1YbindToSyZwEotphXc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2FR6AOWZ6QI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
