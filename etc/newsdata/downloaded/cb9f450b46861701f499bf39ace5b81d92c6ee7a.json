That match is best remembered for Williams\u2019 arguments with chair umpire Carlos Ramos.\n\nShe remains one behind Margaret Court\u2019s record for most Grand Slam trophies and seeks her seventh at the U.S. Open, 20 years after winning her first.\n\nAndreescu, 33-4 this season, can become the first Canadian woman to win a Grand Slam title.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Serena Williams lost her temper and then lost the match when she played for last year's U.S. Open championship.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/us_open_tennis_48136_c0-223-4551-2876_s1770x1032.jpg?aaa399675584b65f2753f21c228d7d910c2488e0", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
