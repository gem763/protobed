People who got hearing aids had an 18% lower risk of being diagnosed with dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, within three years of their hearing loss diagnosis, the study found. The risk of a depression diagnosis was 11% lower and the risk of being injured in a fall was 13% lower.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: A major new study suggests it\u2019s possible to avoid developing dementia \u2014 5 ways to reduce your risk\n\n\u201cThough hearing aids can\u2019t be said to prevent these conditions, a delay in the onset of dementia, depression and anxiety, and the risk of serious falls, could be significant both for the patient and for the costs to the Medicare system,\u201d said Elham Mahmoudi, a University of Michigan health economist who led the study.\n\nPeople with hearing loss may have higher rates of dementia, depression and fall injuries for a variety of reasons, the researchers said, including diminished social interaction, loss of balance and less brain stimulation.\n\nThough their insurance covered part of the cost, only 12% of the people in the Michigan study got hearing aids after they were diagnosed with hearing loss. People wait an average of 10 years to address their hearing loss, sometimes because they don\u2019t like the way hearing aids look or don\u2019t want to feel \u201cold,\u201d according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nCost is another barrier, but could become less of an obstacle next year when over-the-counter hearing aids will become available under a law passed in 2017. The OTC hearing aids are expected to be cheaper, but they\u2019re only designed to help mild or moderate hearing loss, according to the AARP.\n\nMedicare, the government insurance program for people 65 and older, doesn\u2019t pay for hearing aids, which run between $1,000 and $4,000 for one, according to the Hearing Industry Association, the trade group for hearing aid manufacturers.\n\nSee also: Sugar-free sodas linked to a higher risk of death in study of 452,000 people\n\nThe Michigan study found disparities in who was more likely to get a hearing aid: 13.3% of men with hearing loss received them, compared to 11.3% of women. Only 6.5% of people of Latino heritage got a hearing aid, versus 9.8% of African-Americans and 13.6% of whites.\n\nThe study builds on previous research that has identified a link, though not necessarily a causal one, between hearing loss and dementia.\n\nHearing loss affects people\u2019s relationships, their overall physical health, and even their earning power: People with \u201cunaided\u201d hearing loss earned on average $20,000 less annually than those who used hearing aids or cochlear implants, according to the Hearing Loss Association of America.", "description": "Medicare doesn\u2019t cover the cost, but cheaper over-the-counter versions are coming next year.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ785_grandf_ZG_20190905153818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
