Only eating when you\u2019re hungry is not feasible.\u201d For example, having cake at a birthday party usually isn\u2019t about hunger, and sometimes we need to eat before we\u2019re hungry because we won\u2019t have an opportunity to do so later.\n\nFurthermore, as Tribole points out, \u201chonor your hunger\u201d and \u201cfeel your fullness\u201d are only two of the 10 intuitive-eating principles she and Resch created for their 1995 book, \u201cIntuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Program That Works.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t cherry-pick the principles,\u201d she says.\n\nThe other principles are \u201cmake peace with food,\u201d \u201cchallenge the food police,\u201d \u201cdiscover the satisfaction factor,\u201d \u201ccope with emotions without using food,\u201d \u201crespect your body,\u201d \u201cexercise \u2014 feel the difference,\u201d \u201chonor your health with gentle nutrition,\u201d and notably the first principle is \u201creject the diet mentality.\u201d\n\nNew York dietitian Christy Harrison, host of the Food Psych Podcast and author of the forthcoming book \u201cAnti-Diet,\u201d said rejecting the diet mentality is more significant than simply ceasing to diet. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing your mind-set and recognizing, then stepping away from, the internalized beliefs that come from diet culture,\u201d she said. For example, she said, many people are still \u201cdieting\u201d without realizing it, restricting their food choices in the pursuit of health instead of weight loss.\n\nBe open to feeling a little chaotic at first\n\nOne common fear people have when they start to explore intuitive eating is that if they allow themselves to eat formerly off-limits foods, they\u2019ll never be able to stop. Tribole said this is understandable. \u201cWhen someone fears that they\u2019re never going to stop eating their favorite food, it\u2019s probably because they\u2019ve been deprived of it for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you come to intuitive eating really hungry, it\u2019s easy to be afraid that you\u2019re never going to stop eating.\u201d\n\nHarrison said the radical desire to eat, say, cookies, will eventually lessen, even though the pendulum swing from restriction to freedom is going to feel wild and chaotic at first. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a few months, or however long it takes, of feeling a little chaotic if you want to have a balanced relationship with food that\u2019s going to last decades,\u201d she said.\n\nRumsey said another common misperception is that intuitive eating means eat whatever you want, anytime you want. \u201cWith intuitive eating, you have permission to eat what you want, anytime you want, but that doesn\u2019t mean you always do that. Hunger, fullness, satisfaction, how food makes us feel \u2014 those are all important, but intuitive eating also means using your brain and life experience.\u201d\n\nRather than being \u201cone big cheat day,\u201d intuitive eating is about developing \u2014 and using \u2014 interoceptive awareness, the awareness of internal body sensations, Tribole said. \u201cInteroceptive awareness is your superpower,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you know what your needs are physically, you have a treasure trove of information to help guide you.\u201d\n\nAfter years of dieting, it can be hard to tune back into the body\u2019s signals, Harrison said. Intuitive eating\u2019s \u201cunconditional permission to eat is a gentle way back into that,\u201d she said.\n\nShe suggested thinking about \u201cwhat sounds good, what tastes good, what brings me pleasure and joy. Then, come back to how foods are sitting with you. It\u2019s important to let yourself get enough food, and enough varieties of food, first.\u201d\n\nUntangle nutrition from dieting\n\nOne of the intuitive-eating principles is \u201chonor your health with gentle nutrition,\u201d but once people start practicing intuitive eating, they often worry that they\u2019re doing it wrong, or that \u201cdiet mind\u201d is creeping back in when they want broccoli, salmon and quinoa instead of a cheeseburger and fries.\n\n\u201cIntuitive eaters don\u2019t apologize for eating a doughnut or a salad,\u201d Tribole said. \u201cBut the confusion is understandable.\u201d People should ask themselves, \u201cWhat\u2019s the intention behind the desire to eat a healthy food? If the intention is to shrink your body, then that\u2019s a clue that diet mind is at play,\u201d she said.\n\nOther clues are the presence of guilt or fear. \u201cIf there\u2019s any of that feeling of, \u2018If I don\u2019t eat that broccoli, I\u2019m going to ruin my health, or I\u2019m going to gain weight,\u2019 those are clues that diet mentality is creeping in,\u201d Harrison said. She points out that choosing the broccoli can be an act of self-care. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ve noticed that when you include a few servings of vegetables, you feel more energetic and your digestion works better. A truly peaceful relationship with food is about self-care, not self-control.\u201d\n\nGive intuitive eating time to feel intuitive\n\nTribole said that although there are 10 intuitive-eating principles, they are not absolute rules. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as pass or fail; there\u2019s learning and discovering,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, you overate at lunch. Let\u2019s see what happens. Maybe you don\u2019t feel hungry for an afternoon snack; maybe you aren\u2019t as hungry at dinner. Ultimately, it\u2019s not satisfying to undereat, and it\u2019s usually not satisfying to overeat, but you get to decide.\u201d\n\nRumsey said dieting is usually easy at first because there\u2019s a plan to follow and clear rules. But it gets harder over time because the rules aren\u2019t sustainable in real life, and our bodies often push back against the ongoing restriction. \u201cIntuitive eating is the opposite: It\u2019s really hard at first because for most people, it\u2019s totally different than what they\u2019ve been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut over time, intuitive eating gets easier and easier.\u201d\n\nUltimately, said Tribole, \u201cit\u2019s about putting the pleasure back in food and about healing your relationship with food, mind and body so you can live your best life.\u201d\n\nRegistered dietitian Carrie Dennett is author of \u201cHealthy for Your Life: A Holistic Approach to Optimal Wellness\u201d and owner of Nutrition by Carrie.", "description": "Figuring out what you want to eat, rather than what you think you should eat, can be surprisingly difficult.", "authors": ["Carrie Dennett", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OlYJcjM5oyH5W22qlFZuBfJPFBE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y343XOWJYMI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
