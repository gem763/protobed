The museum ought to consider a multiday offer, especially if it\u2019s encouraging visits to both the larger museum and PS1, too. Until then, if you plan to visit several times in the next year, it\u2019s cost-effective to buy an $85 individual membership. Members get in free and can visit for a half-hour before the general public each morning.\n\nYou should plan to visit more than once anyway. MoMA\u2019s curators will be regularly rotating the collection displays; come April, all 20 of the westernmost galleries will be rehung.\n\nI\u2019m still in the lobby, and I\u2019m confused. Which way do I start?\n\nI\u2019d suggest starting on the east side of the museum. (Look for the suspended helicopter.) Take the escalators or elevators to the fifth floor, where the chronological display of the collection (1880-1940) begins. You\u2019ll see C\u00e9zanne and van Gogh with new company, and then discover \u201cLime Kiln Club Field Day\u201d (1914), the first feature-length film (according to MoMA) with an African-American cast.\n\nThe galleries are numbered, so you can work counterclockwise, moving from the older building into the new wing and back. If you\u2019re enjoying the chronological approach, you can do it again on the fourth floor (for postwar art, 1945-75 or so) and the second floor (for contemporary art, from the late 1970s to the present ).\n\nBut if you\u2019re more adventurous, head west from the ticket desk, hit the design gallery and Projects gallery, then hop on the new \u201cblade\u201d staircase by Diller Scofidio + Renfro/Gensler. This way will plunge you into the middle of the timeline; ascend to the fifth floor for Amy Sillman\u2019s exquisite Artist\u2019s Choice show, \u201cThe Shape of Shape\u201d (through April 20), and to the sixth for the new terrace.", "description": "The museum is bigger and more demanding, but there\u2019s more fun, and a sense of serendipity.", "authors": ["Jason Farago"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/arts/17moma-info1/17moma-info1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
