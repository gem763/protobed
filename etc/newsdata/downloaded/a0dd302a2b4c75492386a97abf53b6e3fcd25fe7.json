We always knew it was going to be a challenge playing against Japan given our short turnaround from the Russia game.\n\n'We had the team and we had the ability at the start of that game to go on and win it by the necessary amount of points.\n\n'That we didn't is hugely disappointing. We have to learn from that. We don't get another turn at the World Cup for four years but we've got to improve as we get to next tournament which is the Six Nations in three months' time.'\n\nThe build-up to the match was overshadowed by the threat of Typhoon Hagibis, with the clash at Yokohama's International Stadium only getting the green light eight hours before kick-off.\n\nBut Townsend refused to use that as an excuse for his side's defeat.\n\nIt looked promising for the Dark Blues when Finn Russell put them ahead early but Japan hit back with Kenki Fukuoka's double, plus scores from Kotaro Matsushima and Keita Inagaki.\n\nTownsend faced the media plenty of times ahead of Japan game amid fears of cancellation\n\nScotland's 2019 Rugby World Cup results 27-3 (L) vs Ireland 34-0 (W) vs Samoa 61-0 (W) vs Russia 28-21 (L) vs Japan\n\nScotland refused to go down without a fight but second-half scores from forwards WP Nel and Zander Fagerson were not enough.\n\n'The players acted very professionally,' said Townsend. 'We always believed the game was going to go ahead. Yesterday's training was compromised. We knew this week was going to be a challenge.\n\n'We are disappointed. We look at the game from our point of view, we were disappointed we didn't win.\n\n'We started well and then we didn't see the ball for the rest of the first half.\n\n'We conceded two soft tries and we made too many mistakes. It made it difficult to get the result we were looking for.\n\n'The boys put in a tremendous shift in the second half, but we didn't do enough in that last 20 minutes to get the win.\n\n'It's a huge blow not to reach the knock-out stages, we came here with high aspirations.\n\n'Getting out of the pool stages was the first part of that.\n\n'We have worked incredibly hard over the last few months so we are all hugely disappointed.'", "description": "Gregor Townsend insists Scotland can recover from their World Cup heartache - but knows they must learn from the mistakes that cost them in Japan.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658408-0-image-a-144_1570980597545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
