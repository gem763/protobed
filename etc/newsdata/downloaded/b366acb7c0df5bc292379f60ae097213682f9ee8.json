Time and again, state officials have found that the company\u2019s poorly maintained power lines and transformers have been the source of deadly blazes, resulting in numerous investigations, lawsuits and demands from state leaders to better abide by regulations when it comes to maintaining utility equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, utility provider Southern California Edison has turned off power to around 27,000 customers and is considering doing the same for nearly 400,000 others as hot, dry weather conditions persist.\n\nHere are some of the most troubling fires around the state:\n\nAP Photo/Noah Berger The Kincade fire burns through the Jimtown community of unincorporated Sonoma County on Oct. 24, 2019.\n\nKincade Fire\n\nThe Kincade fire near Geyserville has spread across more than 10,000 acres and remains 0% contained. The blaze that started early Thursday morning has so far damaged at least two structures and forced fire officials to issue evacuation orders to around 2,000 people in the surrounding area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been two years since the fires that devastated our community, and for many, this will be a very stressful and anxious time,\u201d Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said on Thursday, referencing the 2017 fire that was, at the time, the biggest to ever hit the state.\n\nThe cause of the current blaze remains unknown. However, PG&E told state regulators that a high-voltage transmission tower that had not yet been turned off in the planned power outage broke near the origin point of the fire about the time it started.\n\nVideo from the scene of the #MuirFire.

Though this fire is relatively small and in a sparsely populated area, fire officials warned that stronger winds and drier conditions approaching this weekend could exacerbate the situation.\n\n\u201cI urge residents and visitors to use caution,\u201d Marin County Fire Chief Jason Weber said.\n\nCurrently, about 150 personnel are battling the blaze.\n\nCaptured at the #TickFire by reporter \u2066@lunettacaleb\u2069.

Authorities said later that evening at least 40,000 people had been ordered to evacuate in the region.\n\nThe fire had already burned multiple structures and was threatening neighborhoods in the city just north of Los Angeles, spurred by high temperatures and strong winds that officials warned would only get worse as the day went on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything possible to reduce the spread,\u201d Sean Rios, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThe wind is a major factor. All ground and aerial resources are being utilized to the best of their capabilities, but we\u2019re going to be here for a while.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that wind gusts could reach 60 mph on Thursday, and weather conditions were expected to continue overnight and into Friday. The conditions also caused the Tick fire to spew a large plume of smoke into the sky.\n\nSepulveda Fire\n\nA small fire broke out in the Sepulveda Basin of Los Angeles\u2019 San Fernando Valley, burning about two acres and sending smoke into nearby neighborhoods. Weather officials said the blaze was being spurred by strong winds reaching about 25 mph, but noted they were not as strong as those fanning the Tick fire.\n\nThe Sepulveda fire wasn\u2019t immediately threatening homes, but the Los Angeles Fire Department urged residents to gather emergency supplies and monitor local news in case the blaze grew.", "description": "At least 40,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes in the Los Angeles area on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reporter", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db247b52100007d2ead3d61.jpeg?cache=9wlod4qvcx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
