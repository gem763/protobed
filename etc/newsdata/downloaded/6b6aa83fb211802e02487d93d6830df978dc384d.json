This is the one I wore for the album artwork on Romantically Yours, which I released in 2011. I wore it very masculinely, with a shirt and an undone bow tie, but with a little bit of femininity from the diamant\u00e9 belt.\n\nI spend my life in either skinny jeans or trousers. I love trouser suits, and the tux is just the dressed-up version of that. I just think they are elegant and really comfortable to wear. Every time you get invited to a black-tie do, it\u2019s so easy for men \u2013 they just put on a tux and bow tie. Meanwhile, women go through the agonies of choosing a frock. I do sometimes wear dresses but often I think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m just going to wear a tux.\u2019 I think if you get a very beautiful woman in a black tuxedo with bow tie they look fabulous.\n\nDavid Bailey: 'Deneuve said it's great we're divorced \u2013 now we can be lovers!'

It was my first pop album and that tux was made for me by Tommy Nutter, who was one of the great tailors and also one of my best friends. I used to go to Tommy and he\u2019d make me a female equivalent of the suits in men\u2019s stores, to better fit my shape. I\u2019ve still got a few of them, although I can\u2019t get into them any more \u2013 I was quite minute in those days!\n\nI claim to be the first well-known woman to wear brogues. I think I\u2019ve probably got about 50 pairs now, all in different colours. You used not to be able to get brogues for women anywhere, so I went to the Prince of Wales\u2019 shoemaker in Savile Row and had two-tone white and brown ones made for me because I was a huge fan of Fred Astaire. They have got satin ribbon laces and they are beautifully handmade. I\u2019ve got them on a shelf now \u2013 they are kind of like works of art.", "description": "The model, actor and singer on her love of trouser suits \u2013 and why she was the first well-known woman to wear brogues", "authors": ["Leah Harper"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/650159db4de1b1abcbcf26b36561b7a03b8ac006/634_105_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c576cf3b4b4a9697e6f264fa07fa7c51"}
