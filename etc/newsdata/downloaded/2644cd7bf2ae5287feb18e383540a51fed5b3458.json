The New York Times columnist Bret Stephens has repeatedly intimated that, to him, \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d requires ordinary criminality. He recently wrote, \u201cI struggle to see exactly what criminal statute Trump violated with the [Ukraine] call.\u201d\n\nThose most eager to impeach this president may know their Constitution better, but they recognize that crimes are just easier to explain than old Anglo-American legal jargon. So some are tempted to scour the criminal code for a subsection into which one or the other of Trump\u2019s misadventures can be wedged. The most recent example is the vociferous but ultimately pointless argument over whether opposition research\u2014dirt\u2014on a political opponent is a \u201cthing of value\u201d for purposes of federal election laws.\n\nThere are two strong arguments against the idea that the phrase requires criminal behavior: a historical one and a practical one. The history of the phrase \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and of how it entered our Constitution establishes beyond serious dispute that it extends far beyond mere criminal conduct. The practical reasoning is in some ways more important: A standard that permitted the removal of presidents only for indictable crimes would leave the nation defenseless against the most dangerous kinds of presidential behavior.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the history. The British Parliament invented impeachment in 1376, primarily as a legislative counterweight against royal abuses of power. Parliament couldn\u2019t impeach kings and queens, and couldn\u2019t get rid of them at all without an inconvenient and probably bloody revolution. So on occasions when the nobility wasn\u2019t willing to strap on the old chain mail and gather its trusty men-at-arms to have a go at the king\u2019s head, Parliament\u2014acting on the maxim \u201cPersonnel is policy\u201d\u2014struck at the Crown by removing the monarch\u2019s most powerful ministers through impeachment or, sometimes, bills of attainder.\n\nGreat Britain has never had a written constitution. And Parliament has never sat down to write an impeachment statute with a neat definition of the behavior that could get a royal minister impeached. Rather, Parliament has carefully kept impeachment open-ended, recognizing that one never knew in advance what form the royal urge to autocracy might take or what sort of devilry corrupt or ambitious officials might be up to. Over the centuries, Parliament impeached a good many people for a wide variety of misconduct. When it did, the articles of impeachment tended to describe the defendant\u2019s behavior as \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d a usage that dates back to 1386. Critically, a great deal of the misconduct Parliament deemed impeachable wasn\u2019t criminal at all, at least in the sense of violating any preexisting criminal statute or constituting any judge-created common-law crime.", "description": "The constitutional standard for impeachment is different from what\u2019s at play in a regular criminal trial.", "authors": ["Frank O.
