Australia was the first country to ban Huawei from participating in its 5G rollout.\n\nAn area where Australia has taken a global lead is regulation of blockchain, seeking input from a raft of countries including China on setting standards that work worldwide.\n\nOpposition Leader Anthony Albanese said Mr Morrison's speech was a distraction from the domestic economic woes facing Australians.\n\n\"On international issues it's absurd to suggest that somehow voluntary agreements that Australia signs up to are imposed by bureaucracies or international organisations such as the United Nations,\" he said.\n\nDeputy Labor leader Richard Marles said that a host of problems required global solutions, such as climate change.\n\n\"The sort of nationalistic talk we hear at the moment, in the speech last night and also that we heard from the US President a few weeks ago, I think, is not the right tone at this time,\" he said.\n\nAustralian Institute for International Affairs president Allan Gyngell said Mr Morrison's speech was a shift from the 2017 Foreign Policy white paper, which emphasised multilateralism and defending the global rules-based order.\n\n\"There are elements of continuity from earlier things but this had much more of a tone of Trump and Brexit,\" he said.", "description": "Labor criticises the PM for a 'nationalistic' tone in his swipe at global institutions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2848%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_308%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/507f48f23b7c3dd83eac8e67fe0110697fdff6e0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
