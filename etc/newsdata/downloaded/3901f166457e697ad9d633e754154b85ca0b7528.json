Zuma countered with his own legal challenge.\n\nIn July, Zuma faced questioning by Raymond Zondo, a senior judge, mandated to investigate separate allegations of \u201cstate capture\u201d in South Africa during his presidency.\n\n\u2018State capture\u2019: the corruption investigation that has shaken South Africa Read more\n\nIn a public hearing, Zuma denied he had presided over an immense system of corruption and patronage that drained billions from the country\u2019s exchequer, and told the inquiry he was the victim of a plot by foreign intelligence agencies to seek his downfall.\n\nThe former president later ended his testimony, claiming he was being questioned unfairly.\n\nThe judicial inquiry was set up after an ombudsman\u2019s report uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers \u2013 Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta \u2013 and senior officials in Zuma\u2019s administration.\n\nThe report, which stopped short of asserting criminal behaviour, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies had acted improperly.\n\nThe US Treasury announced on Thursday it was placing the Guptas under wide-ranging sanctions for their role in \u201ca significant corruption network in South Africa that leveraged overpayments on government contracts, bribery and other corrupt acts to fund political contributions and influence government actions\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, the treasury alleged that the brothers were able to expand their businesses after immigrating to South Africa in the early 1990s \u201cdue in large part to their generous donations to a political party and their reportedly close relationship with former South African president Jacob Zuma\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe family has been implicated in several corrupt schemes in South Africa, allegedly stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through illegal deals with the South African government, obfuscated by a shadowy network of shell companies and associates linked to the family,\u201d the statement said.\n\nZuma has said the three Gupta brothers are his friends but he denies any influence-peddling in their relationship.\n\nThe Gupta family denied the accusations and left South Africa around the time that Zuma was ousted. They are now believed to be based in Dubai.\n\n\n\n", "description": "High court in South Africa denies former president permanent stay of prosecution", "authors": ["Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cfdb0051e2d6ace6dca0f8c82a978c68f514694/708_238_2034_1220/master/2034.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d19c6e0fef18a555c55b851d6e21928", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
