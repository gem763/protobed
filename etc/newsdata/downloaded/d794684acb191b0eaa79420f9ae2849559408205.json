I hope you break you legs.\"\n\nTeesside Crown Court heard how the victim made eight police calls during their relationship but made no formal complaints until he attacked her in the early hours of April 19, reports Teesside Live .\n\n\"This incident made her believe he was capable of killing her,\" said prosecutor Victoria Lamballe.\n\nHudson had been \"picking on her constantly\" while they took drugs at a friend's home before they went back to their second-floor flat.\n\nWhen she went to bed and turned away from his kiss, he said: \"For f***'s sake man. My own girlfriend doesn't want sex with me.\"\n\nHe pulled off the blankets, grabbed her hair and dragged her into the living room\n\nHe shouted at her, back-handed her and punched her to the face, knocking her to the ground.\n\nThen he steadied himself against the couch and stamped on her body twice with \"eight out of 10\" force.\n\nShe grabbed her belongings but he took them, leading to a struggle where he hit her over the head with one of her trainers.\n\nShe ran downstairs but he followed her, saying: \"I hope you have a panic attack.\"\n\nShe begged him to let her out and he replied: \"You're not f***ing going anywhere.\"\n\nNot knowing what else to do, she climbed out of a window as her assailant shouted: \"Go on. I hope you break your legs.\"\n\nShe jumped and was found distressed and crying by a neighbour who heard the commotion.\n\nShe hobbled away, with Hudson still pursuing her, shouting abuse and pushing her to the ground.\n\nCut and bruised with a possible heel fracture, she had to use crutches afterwards.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nIn her statement, she said: \"When he jumped on my ribs I genuinely thought he was capable of killing me.\n\n\"I knew he was violent but I didn't imagine it to the extent that it was.\n\n\"I've had sleepless nights. I break down in tears when I think of what he put me through.\"\n\nHudson, of Fairy Cove Terrace, Hartlepool , initially denied the assault to police saying the allegations were lies.\n\nHe said he would never hit her, \"loved her to bits\" and she was the \"love of his life\".\n\nHe later admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, with a 2014 assault on a partner among his 32 offences.\n\nHis partner has seemingly forgiven him and decided to stand by him as he starts his prison sentence for prolonged assault.\n\nIn a moving statement, she said: \"My family have told me they believe Hudson will kill me one day.\n\n\"I've told them should that happen I'm not in any pain and I'm at peace.\n\n\"I've made my decision to stay with Hudson and I pray that he will change.\"\n\nMatthew Collins, defending, said: \"He's both ashamed of his actions but also further shamed by the nobility and magnanimity that is shown by the complainant in her ability to forgive him.\n\n\"He knows frankly that he's very very lucky to have the love of a woman who is willing to put something like this aside and move on.\"\n\nHe said Hudson's behaviour could be \"corrected before it descends into an irretrievable character trait\".\n\nRemanded in custody, he had come off drugs, was taking courses and had a labouring job waiting for him as he hoped to provide for his partner and \"hopeful eventual family\".\n\nThe judge, Recorder Patrick Palmer, told Hudson: \"Surprisingly... she wishes to maintain her relationship with you.\n\n\"I've considered whether or not I can suspend your sentence. I cannot. You deliberately stamped on this woman when she was on the ground.\"\n\nHudson burst into tears on a prison video link as he was jailed for 18 months.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone about domestic abuse, call the Freephone 24 Hour National Domestic Violence Helpline, run by Refuge, on 0800 2000 247", "description": "Damien Hudson's girlfriend said she would stand by him during his prison sentence and has forgiven him", "authors": ["Gareth Lightfoot", "Image", "Evening Gazette", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732981.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GLR_MGA_251019Hudson_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
