Kirby Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship in Washington, part of Hillsdale College\u2019s extension curriculum.\n\n\u201cThis issue is about the de-industrialization of the United States. It is the defining issue of our time with many facets, from global capital to currency manipulation,\u201d Mr. Bannon said at a meeting of the Committee on The Present Danger: China.\n\nThe specific topic at hand was a push to keep federal pension money from being invested in international indexed funds that include shares in companies controlled behind the scenes by China\u2019s Communist Party leaders.\n\nWithout the oxygen provided by Western capital and in particular U.S. markets, China\u2019s long-term policy of gaining an upper hand in global finance will suffocate, Mr. Bannon and others say.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s hard-line policy in terms of tariffs and other economic items is precisely the one he must maintain, Mr. Bannon said.\n\n\u201cWe are bringing them to their knees, and their sponsors on Wall Street don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said.\n\nHis work, which includes livestreaming content into China \u2014 with Hong Kong, the Asian finance capital currently rocked by protests over Beijing\u2019s iron fist \u2014 is an example of how Mr. Bannon, 65, has shifted his operations away from candidates and elections and toward the issues he thinks should influence them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s absolutely still going. He\u2019s very active,\u201d said Corey Lewandowski, who also managed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for a time and is now mulling a U.S. Senate bid in New Hampshire. \u201cI believe you are either a visionary, big picture, idea guy \u2014 you are proselytizing for something. Or you aren\u2019t. He is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon\u2019s consulting star waned when he departed the White House and got behind the Senate candidacy of Roy Moore in Alabama. The campaign unraveled in spectacular fashion when decades-old complaints of sexual approaches to teenagers and young women resurfaced and dominated coverage of the candidate.\n\nSince then, Mr. Bannon has not typically been out front as the face of a political campaign. Rather than throw his weight behind candidates, Mr. Bannon, has put out the word that he is working on issues, according to interviews with several people who are either close to him or have partnered with him on endeavors.\n\nMr. Lewandowski\u2019s possible Senate bid is a case in point. He said Mr. Bannon is not advising him on the matter, but the two were recently together on the Mexico border where one of Mr. Bannon\u2019s many projects, We Build the Wall, unveiled a mile-long fence on private property.\n\nMr. Bannon\u2019s interests span west to China and east to Italy and involve efforts to influence matters in Hong Kong and Europe, according to interviews with several of his associates. The international interests expand a peripatetic career in which he has bounced from the Navy to Goldman Sachs and from Washington to Hollywood.\n\nDespite repeatedly insisting he was eager to speak with The Washington Times, Mr. Bannon\u2019s personal team ultimately said he would not have the time to comment for this article.\n\nIn a radio interview Sunday, however, Mr. Bannon confirmed that he has been involved for several months in livestreaming news into mainland China and its semiautonomous region Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWhat you see in Hong Kong is a fight for freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people in the streets have created an insurgency against the totalitarian Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nThe protests roiling Hong Kong are part of an international pattern, Mr. Bannon said. With Brexit, the U.S. political scene, immigration and the trade wars along the Asian rim, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cyou are living in historic times. They will talk about this in 100 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a world in chaos, but I think in this regard President Trump is the stabilizing factor,\u201d Mr. Bannon said.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection is one of his principal goals, according to Mr. Bannon\u2019s circle, and he sees the Democrats\u2019 obsession with long-term global warming in the midst of a momentous present as evidence that they are \u201crunning for student council president.\u201d\n\nSuch biting, off-the-cuff comments are typical Bannon style. Although they have earned him the enmity of the left, they are not representative of the man, according to several who know him well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a happy warrior,\u201d said Noel Fritsch, a Republican consultant who has worked with Mr. Bannon. \u201cI\u2019m always taken aback by media depictions because I don\u2019t sense, feel any negativity with him.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, Mr. Bannon lives in an old diplomatic house in the U.S. capital, a holdover from his days as a co-founder and president of the conservative Breitbart news site, longtime colleagues said.\n\nWhile media photos often portray Mr. Bannon as a sort of brooding, unshaven, right-wing guru, the man is unfailingly well-mannered and intelligent, friends insisted.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been anything but super polite around me,\u201d said Chris McDaniel, a Mississippi state senator whose unsuccessful runs for a U.S. Senate seat have had Mr. Bannon\u2019s backing.\n\nMr. Bannon is able to live such a far-flung life in part because of his own fortune, built on Wall Street and an entertainment stint that includes a piece of the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d syndication pie.\n\nBecause Mr. Bannon sometimes moves under the radar, \u201cSeinfeld\u201d co-creator Larry David reportedly did not learn of Mr. Bannon\u2019s link to the show until 2017, when Mr. Bannon was established as a senior adviser in the Trump administration. Mr. David reacted with predictable Hollywood outrage.\n\n\u201cI had no idea he was profiting from the work of industrious Jews,\u201d Mr. David was quoted as saying in The New Yorker.\n\nMr. Bannon describes his political philosophy as \u201ceconomic nationalism.\u201d In his Thursday speech at Hillsdale, he drew a contrast between his view and what he called the radical chic of \u201csocialist nationalism.\u201d\n\nHis opponents use less-charitable language to describe his work, and some left-wingers insist Mr. Bannon is a white supremacist.\n\nThe notion that there is something sinister and faintly fascistic about Mr. Bannon\u2019s work has been a staple of coverage of his activities, either of his Breitbart days or his current efforts to create a conservative intellectual center at the Trisulti Charterhouse, a 13th-century Italian monastery.\n\nThe think-tank-type endeavor has been tied up by Italian politics, and some European news outlets have depicted the operation in conspiratorial tones, with hints of secret alliances with an underground right-wing clerical cabal in the Vatican.\n\nThe Art newspaper called it \u201ca nationalist boot camp,\u201d and the left-wing establishment in Europe has tried to throw a cloud of potential fascism over the effort.\n\nBut neither Mr. Bannon nor Benjamin Harnwell of the Human Dignity Institute, who would be the president on the ground, is secretive or modest about the goals.\n\n\u201cThe global headquarters of the fight to defend the Judeo-Christian basis of civilization, not just here in Europe but across the world,\u201d Mr. Harnwell told Britain\u2019s Sky News in a piece on the monastery\u2019s possible transformation.\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of sweeping vision and frantic pace that conservatives need, even if Mr. Bannon provides it from a position on the sideline, Mr. Lewandowski said.\n\n\u201cI do think he\u2019s needed,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cBecause other than the president, he is the head of the \u2018MAGA\u2019 movement. There is definitely a need for someone like Steve, a firebrand leader on the outside, and we don\u2019t have that now without him.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
