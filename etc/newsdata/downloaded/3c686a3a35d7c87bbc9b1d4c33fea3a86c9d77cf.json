REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nOdd Per Brekk, deputy director of the IMF\u2019s Asia and Pacific department, also said the BOJ had room to enhance communication by linking its commitment to keep rates low more clearly to its 2% inflation target.\n\n\u201cWe think that lowering the negative interest rate remains an option. Of course, given stubbornly anchored inflation expectations, a whole package (of steps) is needed, especially structural reforms,\u201d Brekk, who is the IMF\u2019s mission chief of Japan, told Reuters on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank fall meetings.\n\nThe BOJ deployed an aggressive monetary easing program in 2013 as part of the \u201cthree arrows\u201d of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s \u201cAbenomics\u201d stimulus policies, which were aimed at pulling the country out of deflation.\n\nWhile the monetary easing and fiscal spending helped stimulate growth, critics say Abe failed to deliver on the structural reforms needed to boost Japan\u2019s growth potential, such as labor market reforms.\n\nBrekk refrained from commenting on whether the BOJ could or should ease monetary policy at its rate review this month.\n\nMarkets are rife with speculation the BOJ could top up stimulus at its Oct. 30-31 meeting, after it signaled last month the chance of imminent action by warning of escalating overseas risks.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said deepening negative rates is among key options if the central bank were to ease.\n\nBut the move is highly controversial as it would put further strain on financial institutions\u2019 profits and could discourage them from boosting lending. Some analysts warn that further rate cuts could push some regional banks into financial trouble.\n\nBrekk said the plight of regional banks must be dealt with as a structural problem that can be addressed by strengthened oversight and supervision by bank regulators.\n\n\u201cWhat we are recommending is to deal with those issues through changes in business models. For regional banks, it may perhaps involve consolidation, though it may be difficult for many reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder a policy dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield around 0% to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target.\n\nIt has pledged to keep rates at current ultra-low levels for an extended period of time, at least until around spring next year.", "description": "Deepening negative interest rates remains an option if the Bank of Japan were to ramp up stimulus, though any such move must be accompanied by fiscal and structural steps to be effective, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Friday.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442467004&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H26A", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
