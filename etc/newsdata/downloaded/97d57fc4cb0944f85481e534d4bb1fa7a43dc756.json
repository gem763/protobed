I expect a premier to have an idea for Italy, not continual insults. He is a man who is aligned with power, without dignity.\u201d\n\nConte said: \u201cI see no dignity in your volte-face. Assigning one\u2019s faults to others is the most linear way to dodge responsibility for life, a sure way, but not the best, to save one\u2019s leadership. To err is human, but to give other people the blame is the best way to keep the leadership of your party.\u201d\n\nItaly was plunged into chaos last month when Salvini withdrew the League from its fractious alliance with M5S as he sought to exploit his party\u2019s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister.\n\nThe move threatened to create a fully far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. The two parties are longstanding enemies and the two largest parties in parliament.\n\nAfter two weeks of negotiations, last week Conte announced his team of ministers, pledging that the new coalition would be less antagonistic and more respectful than the previous one. The list included Roberto Gualtieri, an influential PD member of the European parliament, as economy minister. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, will be foreign minister.\n\nLuciana Lamorgese, a veteran of the interior ministry in charge of planning refugee and migrant reception centres in northern Italy, has succeeded Salvini in his former role.\n\nMany challenges lie ahead. Last week the parties published a 26-point programme intended to underpin the government. At the top of the list was a commitment to use the forthcoming budget to help to stimulate economic growth, but also a promise that it would not endanger public finances.\n\nItaly has the second-largest debt burden in the EU as a proportion of economic output, and the pact called for greater flexibility from Brussels to overcome the \u201cexcessive rigidity\u201d of existing budget rules.\n\nMany analysts have cast doubt on how long the new coalition will last. Others argue that the prospect of Salvini forming a far-right government with Brothers of Italy, a party with a neo-fascist lineage, after a new election will hold the coalition together. According to polls, the League is still the biggest party in Italy despite losing some of its popularity in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cToday the division between the closed palace and the Italy in the street is evident,\u201d Salvini said on Monday. He has called for a demonstration to be held in Rome in October.", "description": "Senators back new EU-friendly government aimed at drawing line under Salvini crisis", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cc6ace4324a434464e205c39d8be0546f4ef06e/1312_228_2288_1373/master/2288.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b1380c6cf43582e7b6cca36bb43a049", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
