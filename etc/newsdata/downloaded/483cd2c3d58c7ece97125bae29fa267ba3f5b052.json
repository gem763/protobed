(Teresa Castracane/Theater J)\n\nTheater critic\n\n\u201cLove Sick\u201d is the on-the-nose title of actress-composer Ofra Daniel\u2019s song cycle about a woman driven mad by passion. Based on romantic poetry embedded in the book of the Old Testament known as the Song of Songs, the show amounts to a celebration of sensuality, built upon the allure of Daniel herself.\n\nYet even over a relatively taut 90 minutes, \u201cLove Sick\u201d wears a little thin as a dramatic offering. Once Theater J\u2019s production reveals its framework \u2014 an old woman of Jerusalem in rags, taking us back to her constricted, lovelorn youth \u2014 the piece lingers over her longing, like a storm hovering in idle. My patience for it waned, as its purplish lyricism, adapted from the language of the Bible, asserted primacy ever more emphatically over the evening\u2019s more seductive facets.\n\n\n\nOfra Daniel as Tirzah. (Teresa Castracane/Theater J)\n\nThose would include the lush songs themselves, composed by Lior Ben-Hur and Daniel and played by a six-person band of string and woodwind players and percussionists. Director Christopher Renshaw has them roving the stage of the newly refurbished Aaron and Cecile Goldman Theater at the Edlavitch D.C. Jewish Community Center. The effect is a pleasing informality \u2014 the idea conveyed of street musicians as wordless troubadours \u2014 and it helps that they are, to a person, exceptional.\n\nRenshaw, who two decades ago staged a provocative \u201cThe King and I\u201d on Broadway that sought to underline the Eastern elements in Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s musical, seeks a similar authenticity for a new show with Middle Eastern roots. (Daniel is Israeli born and now lives in the Bay Area.) Misha Kachman\u2019s graffiti- and litter-strewn set, dominated by an old tree with myriad outstretched barren limbs struck me as a bit too literal, though it does evoke the disorder and despair of Daniel\u2019s outcast Tirzah \u2014 a name taken directly from the Song of Songs.\n\nThrough the fablelike dreaminess of \u201cLove Sick,\u201d we are meant to bond with Tirzah and feel for her plight: She\u2019s married off to the dullest of husbands, a fishmonger played by Sasha Olinick. (Nothing says marital buzzkill like a dead carp.) But \u201cThe Fish Song,\u201d the powerfully voiced Olinick\u2019s character-defining number, underscores what needs to be bolstered in \u201cLove Sick\u201d: It comes across as only a partly finished thought. And for all the time we spend with Tirzah, an opportunity for her to express some vibrant need (other than for a man) never materializes. We\u2019re kept at arm\u2019s length, admirers of the character\u2019s physical and musical gifts but left undereducated about her soul. By evening\u2019s end, when the truth of Tirzah\u2019s passionate fixation is disclosed, the poignancy of her tale hasn\u2019t been fully activated.\n\n\n\nOfra Daniel and musician Ali Paris. (Teresa Castracane/Theater J)\n\nOne lovely conceit that does work well: Nestled in the limbs of the tree much of the time is the musician Ali Paris, singing and strumming his qanun, a beguiling, 76-string Middle Eastern zither that dates back millennia. He\u2019s the lover with whom Tirzah communes, and Paris\u2019s vocalizing, with his warm, versatile trill, sounds like a human equivalent of birdsong. You will be compelled to a belief in the mating call.\n\nAs in Song of Songs, the women of Jerusalem are conjured in \u201cLove Sick,\u201d here a chorus of four (Sarah Corey, Sarah Laughland, Kara-Tameika Watkins and Kanysha Williams), to lend some satisfying harmonies. The women perform a vital narrative function, though not perhaps to the degree they might. Daniel assigns herself the central role in the protracted prologue, an introduction to the story that feels awkward and ill-conceived. Would not the legend of Tirzah be a more resonant document if there were a stronger sense in \u201cLove Sick\u201d of it being passed on, from generation to generation? Would that not be clearer if it were these other women welcoming us into the story?\n\nMusical theater is best when the music itself has some multifunctional design, when it explores new ways of telling a story as well as illuminating characters\u2019 interior lives. \u201cLove Sick\u201d has found a way to nurture beauty; it should want to nourish the mind as well.\n\nLove Sick, music by Ofra Daniel and Lior Ben-Hur; written and adapted by Daniel.
