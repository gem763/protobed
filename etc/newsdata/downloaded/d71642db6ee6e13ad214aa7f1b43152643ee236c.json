On the eve of the ceremony marking establishment of the People\u2019s Republic on 1 October that year, the then 27-year-old page editor at the People\u2019s Daily worked through the night to ensure the paper would come out without a glitch. The next day he joined the celebrations with his colleagues, while his wife stayed at home with their baby.\n\nThe streets were filled with the sound of people chatting and singing. With the five-star red national flags billowing, hundreds of thousands of people waited for hours before Mao Zedong appeared on the balcony of the Gate of Heavenly Peace to announce the founding of the PRC. \u201cWe were so excited. We thought: at last, the Chinese people are united,\u201d said He, now 97. His first article after the founding day was headlined \u201cFrom darkness into brightness\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe had a decade of civil war before ... so we were looking forward to building a democratic and peaceful China under a coalition government,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, China will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the communist regime with fireworks and a massive military parade to showcase legions of troops and its latest weaponry, much like the one attended by the young journalist. But for He the show of national strength will lead to reflections on his lost dreams of a democratic China.\n\nThe early years of the PRC\u2019s coalition government consisted of several political parties under the leadership of the Communists guided by the principle of Mao\u2019s \u201cnew democracy\u201d. During that phase the Communist party was supposed to share power before advancing on to socialism and finally communism. \u201cThe ideas of the Communist party\u2019s new democracy and a coalition government won over us,\u201d said He, with a tinge of sadness in his voice. \u201cWe really had great hopes for new China, but the result wasn\u2019t quite what we expected,\u201d said He.\n\nAs a teenager, He had loathed the corrupt and dictatorial rule under the Nationalist party before 1949. With ideals of fraternity, freedom and equality in mind, he and many other young people saw the Communists as the answer to the salvation of China, as championed by Mao and the party propagandists in the 1940s.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1946, the Communist party mouthpiece Xinhua Daily had an editorial every year on 4 July, America\u2019s Independence Day, praising democratic ideals. In interviews with foreign journalists, Mao praised President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s advocacy of four freedoms, particularly the freedom from fear and freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cWe thought when the Communist party was in power it would follow the US democratic path. We genuinely believed that Mao would implement it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after people gain power, it\u2019s easy to become dictatorial.\u201d\n\nHe got involved with the Communist party because of his democratic ideals. Under the National party, when communist sympathisers were harshly oppressed, 18-year-old He and his friends formed an underground reading group to study pro-democracy publications. After he went to study journalism in 1943 at the prestigious Fudan University, then based in the southwestern city of Chongqing during the Sino-Japanese war, he and his girlfriend (who became his wife) helped set up a student newspaper which acted as a front for clandestine communist activities.\n\nAfter their names got on the Nationalist government\u2019s blacklist, they escaped to the nearest communist base in July 1946, where they joined the newly founded People\u2019s Daily \u2013 then operating secretly in the rural part of the northern province of Hebei. They even changed their names to protect their families \u2013 to this day, he still uses He Yanling, his adopted name. They became party members a year later.A few years after the regime took over, Mao began to abandon his new democracy principles. Political movements such as the \u201cthought reform\u201d campaign and anti-rightism of the 1950s, which attacked intellectuals as bourgeois class enemies, the Great Leap Forward in 1958 \u2013 a radical agricultural campaign that led to 40 million people starving to death \u2013 and the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 blighted the lives of millions of ordinary people.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tiananmen Square, June 1989. Photograph: Jeff Widener/AP\n\nHe and his wife, Song Zheng, were implicated in 1959 in the \u201canti-right opportunist campaign\u201d for having reported about people starving to death and party cadres\u2019 abuse of power during the Great Leap Forward in rural China. In the Cultural Revolution, he was castigated as a \u201ccounter-revolution revisionist\u201d and \u201ccapitalist roader\u201d and put under detention. \u201cFor more than two decades, there was no productivity and no improvement of people\u2019s lives \u2013 that wasn\u2019t socialism,\u201d He sighed.\n\n\u201cMao had a big ego and wouldn\u2019t admit to his mistakes. He suppressed voices of discontent to uphold his ruling position. He launched class struggles, and people who disagreed with him were cast as dissidents from hostile classes. Things developed into the Cultural Revolution, and even he lost control over that.\u201d\n\nMao died in 1976, and the tumultuous decade of chaos came to an end. In 1978 the reformist leader Hu Yaobang began to rehabilitate political victims and the party began a programme of political and economic liberalisation. Hu\u2019s death sparked the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement, which ended in a bloody military crackdown on 4 June 1989.\n\nHe said he \u201calmost completely lost hope\u201d over the brutality of the crushing of students and ordinary people who were calling for democracy, but was also worried about the future of political and economic reforms. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t lose hope completely, because most people in the party were opposed to it,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter He and his wife retired, they and two other retired state media journalists spent nearly two decades researching historical archives and interviewing people like themselves who risked their lives as idealistic students under the Nationalist party to advocate communism before 1949.\n\nThis resulted in three volumes of books, with the last volume unable to publish in China because of the candid chronicling of the tragic fates of former underground party members who suffered in countless political movements under the Communist regime. Many intellectuals were banished to hard labour in the countryside for their \u201cbourgeois\u201d and \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d political stance.\n\nReflecting on his life, He said he didn\u2019t feel cheated by the Communist party, like some people from his generation. He said he and many in the party had been shocked when Mao abandoned his New Democracy principles in 1952, but he had gone along with it and had even believed that some sacrifices of freedoms under Mao\u2019s \u201csocialist transformation\u201d drive were justified.\n\n\u201cI too had doubts \u2026 but Mao enjoyed a supreme status in new China and the cult of personality was strong. People who expressed doubts were seen as \u2018lagging behind\u2019,\u201d He said.\n\nSeventy years on, He is philosophical about his lost dreams of democracy and freedom. While he does not like the tightening of ideological control that has happened over recent years, He feels it is the authorities\u2019 response to China finding itself in an increasingly complex international order.\n\nIn view of the rise of nationalism and unilateralism, as well as economic crises in the west, which young idealists like him looked up to for democratic inspiration in the 1940s, He believes its \u201cinitial glitz of democratic spirit has been slowing and tarnishing\u201d while China\u2019s power has been rising. \u201cAs to what is genuine freedom and democracy,\u201d he said, \u201cthe absolute standard has been lost.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protests in Hong Kong, September 2019.
