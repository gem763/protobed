But when that law was being passed in 2011, the then Conservative minister for constitutional reform Mark Harper said such a move would be \u201cabsolutely unconstitutional\u201d and warned that \u201cpublic would not respond well to a government behaving in that way.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasova", "Cnn.Com Europe Boris-Johnson-Options-Brexit-Gbr-Intl Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
