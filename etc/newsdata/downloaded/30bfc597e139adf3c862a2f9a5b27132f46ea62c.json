Lawmakers rejected proposed Brexit agreements from former Prime Minister Theresa May three times.\n\nLawmakers will vote Saturday on Johnson\u2019s EU deal. The prime minister needs 320 votes to get the proposal through Parliament, but they may be difficult to find. The Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which comprises a key portion of British Parliament, and Labor Party lawmakers have already rejected the agreement.\n\nJohnson sounded optimistic about Saturday\u2019s make-or-break vote, and said he doesn\u2019t plan to ask for a delay \u2014 as required by the Benn Act \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t pass Parliament.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been at this now, as I say, for three-and-a-half years,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been an easy experience for [Britain]. It\u2019s been long, it\u2019s been painful, it\u2019s been divisive. And now is the moment for us as a country to come together. Now is the moment for our parliamentarians to come together and get this thing done.\u201d\n\nThe DUP said it will reject the agreement \u2014 and some members of Johnson\u2019s own party have said they won\u2019t vote for it, either, if the DUP isn\u2019t on board.\n\nThere could be some Labor Party defections, however, to give Johnson\u2019s prospects more weight. Lawmaker John Mann said he plans to vote for the deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal that\u2019s been agreed with the European Union, it\u2019s a two-side deal and that satisfies me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Guardian reported Friday German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told EU leaders another extension is unavoidable if British lawmakers reject the new proposal.", "description": "Oct. 18 (UPI) \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to London Friday to try and sell Parliament the new agreement he brokered with the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
