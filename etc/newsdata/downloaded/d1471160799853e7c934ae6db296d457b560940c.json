In this series, the team at VICE's Astro Guide explain each planet, and how it correlates to your natal chart.\n\nVenus is the planet of love, beauty, values, and money, and its placement in your natal chart can tell us what you\u2019re attracted to, be it in romantic partners, in aesthetics like art or fashion, or in life in general. It also tells us what you attract in terms of people, gifts, and resources, and how you attract what you want to you (alluring Venus loves to be adored!).\n\nAlmost anything related to pleasure can be considered Venusian in astrology: love, dating, beauty, art, fashion, perfume, jewelry, money, gifts. Venus rules Taurus and Libra, two signs associated with style and decadence, and often considered the most fashionable signs of the zodiac. In a natal chart, Venus can offer insights into what makes someone feel attractive, what they find beautiful, and what they\u2019re willing to devote themselves to.\n\nTo find your Venus sign, plug in your birth date, time, and place into your preferred birth chart generator and find the symbol near your sun sign that looks like a handheld mirror. Venus never strays more than two signs away from the sun, so your Venus sign will be within two signs behind or ahead of your sun sign. Once you\u2019ve figured it out, read what our team of astrologers at Astro Guide have to say about your Venus sign!\n\nAries Venus\n\nPeople with Venus in Aries are fearless, direct, and confident in love. You know what you want when you see it, and are more prone than most to experiencing love at first sight...but your curiosity must be piqued to keep your attention and sustain passion! You\u2019re not interested in having a meek partner and prefer to be with someone who can stand up for themself. You can be pushy to get what you want, sometimes showing off to get your crush\u2019s attention. You\u2019re courageous with your love, willing to take risks if it means obtaining the object of your affection, and you generally don\u2019t believe in being fussy or elaborate.\n\nYour love can be taken at face value, though you can sometimes be impulsive in your relationships. You may have a dramatic sex appeal\u2014think leather, fishnets, red lipstick\u2014or are too busy running around to wear more than whatever\u2019s comfortable. You have a loud sense of style and others perceive you as fearless, bold, sexy, and confident. Though you\u2019re often quick to pick up the tab, it would help to remember that it\u2019s OK to let someone else take care of you, too. There\u2019s an inherent childlike innocence about you, and your relationships, romantic or otherwise, can teach you a lot about what it takes for you to feel safe and trusting.\n\nTaurus Venus\n\nVenus is home in the sign of Taurus, and people with this placement are very grounded and often in touch with their sensuality. You value security and enjoy indulging your senses with soft fabrics, beautiful scents, decadent meals, and relaxing massages. That said, retail therapy and mouth-watering desserts are amazing treats, but too much of a good thing can leave you working harder to maintain your financial and physical health\u2014two things you actually really care about!\n\nYou commit to partners\u2014or decide to end things with partners\u2014through a slow process of deliberation, and prefer romantic relationships to run smoothly. You\u2019re content with things staying the same as long as they\u2019re pleasant. Affectionate details, like a whisper in the ear or a kiss on the neck, are the kinds of things that get you going. You\u2019re very patient, but it would be wise for your partners to avoid pushing or testing your limits. If you do break-up with someone, it will likely have something to do with not feeling valued.\n\nGemini Venus\n\nPeople with Venus in Gemini are social butterflies who deeply value intellectual connection. You\u2019re generally a flirty person who enjoys witty banter, and it isn\u2019t difficult for you to strike up a conversation with a stranger\u2014you believe everyone is just a friend you haven\u2019t met yet! It\u2019s important to you that you\u2019re viewed as intelligent, clever, and interesting, and have a tendency to dress on the youthful side. Gemini is ruled by Mercury, the planet of the mind and communication, so you can sometimes be interested in or date people out of curiosity rather than wholehearted romantic interest, and you\u2019re definitely more likely than other signs to be into someone for their mind than their body.\n\nGood communication is a must for your relationships, and you do not do well with partners who aren\u2019t forthcoming. You enjoy flirting over text, are adept at double entendres, and think good conversation is foreplay. You like to keep your partner guessing, and hope they\u2019d do the same for you\u2014in fact, boredom is a death knell for your partnerships. You prefer variety in love, and don\u2019t like to tie yourself down to one mode of being in a relationship. Your love language is likely words of affirmation; you like to express your affection and hear it back, too!\n\nCancer Venus\n\nFor those with Venus in Cancer, relationships are centered on emotions, and how they can be of service to make their partner feel safe and nurtured. Cancer is known as a caring water sign, so you\u2019re acutely sensitive to your partner\u2019s emotional world, and want to create a safe space where love can blossom. Your ideal partner is someone who feels like family, or can integrate into your own family seamlessly, like someone who is good with children or takes care of others. Though you have a demure and domestic side, you also sometimes need plenty of space, and have a deep well of sexual passion within you.\n\nYou\u2019re unlikely to make the first move unless you feel really comfortable with someone, and are more likely to flirt by sharing your feelings or indulging in others\u2019. You might flirt with someone by cooking for them, inviting them to your home, or demonstrating that you remember small details about them. Venus in Cancer folks are often fairly traditional, and you might be more likely to believe in celebrating every anniversary, reminisce about the past, and have regular family gatherings with lots of food. You like keepsakes and heirlooms and have a hard time letting go of a relationship once it ends. You expect to care deeply for your partner, and to be cared for in return\u2014to you, loving someone means being supportive, and becoming each other\u2019s family.\n\nLeo Venus\n\nVenus in Leo folks need to know that their partners see and adore them. You\u2019re bright, funny, charming, full of infectious laughter, and can easily capture the gaze of those around you. Leo is known as the superstar of the zodiac, so you\u2019re more likely to wear things that are loud or colorful and flirt with people by showing off. Like Leo\u2019s ruling planet, the Sun, you love to be the center of attention. You\u2019re generally loyal and want a partner that you\u2019d be proud to show off to the crowd; you\u2019re the Venus placement most likely to believe in \u201cleagues\u201d (and believe that yes, you\u2019re out of most people\u2019s), and public displays of affection are more likely to turn you on than off.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve honed in on an object of affection, you like to dote on them in grandiose ways, showering them with compliments and giving them extravagant gifts. You have a strong desire to be your lover\u2019s favorite, but if you aren\u2019t mindful of consciously working with your insecurities, you may get a bit catty when someone diverts attention from you. You believe love should be a magical fairytale and take great offense if your partner forgets a major event, birthday, or anniversary\u2014especially if that means they forgot to get you a present! You believe love should always be romantic and unconditional, and can be deeply wounded if relationships lose their sparkle. You love the chase, and your ideal partner is someone who challenges you in life!\n\nVirgo Venus\n\nVenus in Virgo is a more challenging placement; people with this in their chart may be hard on others because they\u2019re also hard on and incredibly critical of themselves. Being honed in on flaws can also make it difficult for you to enjoy yourself, and you may need the help of your lovers and partners to get out of your head and stop over-analyzing! Remember: Virgo is the sign of flawlessness, and the truth is that who you are is already perfect. Virgo is also the sign of service, so you\u2019re likely to show your interest in someone by waiting on them hand and foot. You often do small things that can go unnoticed, and might have trouble receiving favors or gifts since you might feel guilty and obligated to reciprocate right away.\n\nIt\u2019s the little things that speak the loudest to you; you\u2019ll remember how your crush takes their coffee or tea and appreciate when someone returns this thoughtfulness with gestures like remembering what you like or a story you shared. You\u2019re also very attuned to cleanliness and unlikely to be interested in someone who is messy or has bad hygiene. In fact, you\u2019re probably the placement most likely to break up with someone on the grounds that their breath stinks! But you\u2019re not afraid to dive into the unsexy details to maintain a relationship and believe that true love is dedication.\n\nLibra Venus\n\nPeople with Venus in Libra are charming, charismatic, and usually quite popular because they know how to appeal to anyone. Even if you don\u2019t fit the conventional standards of beauty, you exude charisma, intelligence, and grace, making it hard for people not to be attracted to you! You have a hard time making up your mind, often waiting to commit until the very last moment because you\u2019re afraid of making the wrong choice when it comes to love. You flourish with a partner who\u2019s considered charming and well-mannered, and has good taste!\n\nAs the sign of justice, Libra requires an intelligent partner, and you wouldn\u2019t consider dating someone unless they were demonstrably intelligent. You value the art of conversation\u2014both spoken and written\u2014which makes it hard for you to be attracted to someone if they can\u2019t intrigue you with their ideas. Venus in Libra is also very concerned with fairness, so you prefer to spend time with people who treat others with kindness and abide by the golden rule. You\u2019re a diplomat who loves love and rarely shows up without a plus one!\n\nScorpio Venus\n\nPeople with Venus in Scorpio are concerned with the intensity, passion, honesty, and intimacy of a relationship. You exude a hypnotic and charismatic quality but can sometimes be unsure of yourself, which you hide with an austere or guarded way of dealing with people you have feelings for.\n\nYou\u2019re unlikely to be the first to admit you have feelings for someone; perhaps because Scorpio is the sign of mystery or you may be afraid your confidence will take a hit. When you are into someone, you dig deep to find out everything you can about a lover, and flirt really well without others noticing, like dropping a joke under your breath or sneaking in a grazing touch. You\u2019re unlikely to trust a partner until it has been proven to you that you can, and you can be possessive and have a hard time letting go. You\u2019re generally an incredibly loyal partner, but operate with a scorched earth policy. Your love has a deep, penetrating, and gutsy quality to it that could make more prudish folks turn bashful or shy.\n\nSagittarius Venus\n\nPeople with Venus in Sagittarius are bold, flirty, party-goers who aren\u2019t afraid to make a fashion statement! You pursue love without reservation and may have unconventional love interests. You\u2019re open to dating someone very unlike you, and are impressed when someone takes a strong stance and stands up for their beliefs. You believe love should be playful and want a partnership where you encourage each other\u2019s freedom and personal philosophies. You love to debate, you\u2019re a contrarian at heart, and you don\u2019t believe in growing old with a partner\u2014you\u2019d much rather grow young with them!\n\nYou like to get the attention of a love interest by goofing off or being loud, and you don\u2019t form attachments very easily. In fact, you have no reservations about letting go and believe that love should be lighthearted and carefree, with partners free to grow into the best version of themselves. You show your love by making your partner laugh and demonstrating how open-minded you are. You fear stagnation and the feeling of being tied down by relationships, and are more likely to be interested in non-traditional approaches to partnership.\n\nCapricorn Venus\n\nPeople with Venus in Capricorn take love seriously! You love a partner who seems stable and reliable, but you may also be attracted to someone who seems walled off or unapproachable. You\u2019re unlikely to be into a \u201cwild child\u201d type and the sign most likely to crave a traditional fancy dinner first date. You\u2019re reserved in expressing affection and often choose to do so by purchasing high ticket gifts for a partner, like jewelry, flowers, or top quality items. You enjoy hearing about your date\u2019s ambitions and are unlikely to be interested in someone who isn\u2019t a high achiever. You want to be with someone who\u2019s seen as credible, serious, and educated, which is why you often date more mature or older partners. Sensuality and touch are also very important to you.\n\nSimilarly, you flirt by showing how responsible you are, or by talking about your successes at work. You\u2019re unlikely to commit to a relationship that doesn\u2019t meet the conventional standards of what a functional relationship should look like. You flourish with a partner who shows loyalty, commitment, and sustainability, and is clear about their boundaries and intentions. You believe in being responsible with the way you love, and treat relationships like investments. Once you decide someone is worthy of your time and affection, you\u2019re ready to put them in your five-year plan.\n\nAquarius Venus\n\nPeople with Venus in Aquarius believe that being in love means being best friends. You take a humanitarian approach to relationships and believe in decency above all else, to the occasional point of being detached. That said, you\u2019re very loyal, even when you seem aloof. You are most attracted to people who have developed character and a vivid sense of self, especially if it strays from mainstream ideas of how a person is \u201csupposed to be.\u201d You\u2019re a progressive person who loves to experiment and spend time with rebels and eccentrics\u2014after all, you\u2019re one, too!\n\nYou flirt by drawing attention to how different or open-minded you are, and you love and accept unconventional people as they are. You are more interested than others in non-traditional relationship structures and think it\u2019s crucial that you and your partner have the freedom to explore sexuality. Open-minded partners and relationships are an absolute necessity for you!\n\nPisces Venus\n\nPeople with Venus in Pisces can bring the shallow beauty of Venus to a deeper, more transcendental state. You have a sentimental and romantic quality about you, and see past appearances and status when it comes to romance. You are adept at subtlety and nuance and know how to weave together a magical moment.\n\nYou\u2019re laid back, possibly to the point of laziness\u2014but you\u2019re just as likely to crave a chill night in with your lover as you are to go on a days-long bender of dancing and romance. You\u2019re most interested in being with people who validate your emotional and spiritual experiences, and can enjoy feeling vulnerable or being in a position where you are taken over by others. That said, you\u2019re also known to project feelings and fantasies onto crushes and partners, which eventually leads to major disappointment. You love to get lost in the idea of romance and may often find yourself heavily infatuated with artists. Vulnerability and sacrifice are your biggest turn-on, and you believe sex should be transcendent and without boundaries.\n\nWhat's in the stars for you in October?
