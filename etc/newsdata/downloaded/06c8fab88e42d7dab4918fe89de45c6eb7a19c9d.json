Or something like that. He was a novelty, the next iteration of Herman Cain, an entertaining sideshow in an otherwise solemn field of Democratic contenders.\n\nToday, it\u2019s no longer possible to dismiss Yang so easily. In the six months since Marchand came onboard, Yang has outpolled senators and House members in the race, raised substantial funds, and cultivated a fanatical online following that calls itself the Yang Gang. Nowadays, Marchand says, his biggest headache in running Yang\u2019s New Hampshire operation is finding enough qualified people fast enough to build an operation that can compete with Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. When he and I spoke last month, Marchand told me his team numbered in the single digits. It had doubled by the following week. He now tells Rolling Stone that the campaign is expecting to surpass 75 full-time staff in New Hampshire by the end of the month.\n\nOn Wednesday, his campaign announced it had raised $10 million in the previous three months. For perspective, Yang\u2019s third-quarter haul is $4 million more than Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), $8 million more than Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and only $1.6 million shy of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Still, Yang is polling well behind Warren, Sanders, and Joe Biden. If not a miracle, he needs a dramatic realignment inside the Democratic Party to win the nomination.\n\nIn order to do so, Yang and his team must translate his viral support into a real campaign \u2014 without losing what makes Yang Yang. That means on-the-ground organizing in early primary and caucus states, a strategy for the crucial but unglamorous work of winning delegates in as many states as possible, and a plan for turning Yang into a household name. All while preserving the candidate\u2019s unscripted and refreshingly unpolitical style.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s so different resonates,\u201d says Rebecca Katz, a progressive political consultant who worked for Sen. Harry Reid and advised Bill de Blasio\u2019s 2013 New York mayoral run. \u201cThe candidates doing the best are the ones who are authentic. There is a case to be made that Andrew Yang could be one of the last people standing out of a field of 25 candidates.\u201d\n\nOver the past month, half a dozen of Yang\u2019s senior staffers told Rolling Stone about their plan to build what is essentially Yang 2.0 and not wind up as the next Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich: fringe candidates with small but loyal followings who could never break into the mainstream. \u201cIn my office, there\u2019s one poster on the wall: It\u2019s the primary and caucus calendar, and then all the way into November of 2020,\u201d says Nick Ryan, Yang\u2019s campaign chief. \u201cThis is a candidate and campaign that are built to last.\u201d\n\nFor much of its brief existence, Yang 2020 has been an online phenomenon. As Yang told Rolling Stone earlier this year, \u201cI came from the internet.\u201d When I interviewed him back in June, his entire campaign had just over 30 full-time staffers. (For context, Sanders, at the time, had more staff than that just in New Hampshire.) Yang\u2019s top aides were political newcomers: Ryan, the campaign chief, was a former Army platoon leader who joined the campaign after going to business school at NYU, and Zach Graumann, Yang\u2019s campaign manager and unflappable sidekick, had worked on Wall Street and run a small nonprofit. Employees filled multiple roles, and the whole thing had a make-it-up-as-you-go vibe. \u201cThe vaguer the title, the more accurate it is,\u201d Carly Reilly, Yang\u2019s deputy chief of staff, told me back then.\n\nYang\u2019s first inflection point was his appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s wildly popular podcast in February. The next inflection point was the second Democratic debate, in July. After a dismal showing at the first debate, Yang gave a strong (and unorthodox) performance in Detroit. Afterward, there was a boost in interest in Yang and his universal basic income proposal \u2014 a surge that has never receded. \u201cThat was really the moment,\u201d Marchand says.\n\nYang\u2019s campaign had already attracted people drawn to insurgent candidates: One of his early advisers was Liam deClive-Lowe, an organizer on Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2018 Senate run and Sanders\u2019 2016 bid. But once it was clear the Yang bump was real, Democratic operatives with years of experience started calling the campaign looking for jobs.\n\nOne of those people was Zach Fang. In 2016, Fang had helped run field organizing for Sanders in Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Maryland; he left a job on Congressman Tim Ryan\u2019s presidential run to work for Yang. Eric Ming and Jared Volz, two Democratic consultants with decades of combined experience in the labor movement and congressional campaigns, came onboard as digital director and deputy campaign manager, respectively.\n\nOne lingering question among progressive consultants is whether Yang can preserve what makes him unique while bringing on more traditional staffers. \u201cAre they going to follow the D.C. playbook and kill the authority of the people that got this so big?\u201d one ex-Sanders staffer asks.\n\nAs field director, Fang tells me his job is to channel Yang\u2019s online following into the kinds of actions that will increase Yang\u2019s name ID with potential voters, grow the number of campaign volunteers, and start to build real support for Yang at the ground level. There\u2019s no shortage of volunteers: At a recent all-staff meeting, the senior staff announced that the campaign\u2019s Slack channel for active volunteers had surpassed its 10,000th member. There\u2019s a saying inside the campaign, Fang says: \u201cWe need to move from URL to IRL.\u201d\n\nFang began by building full-time teams in crucial early states such as Iowa and Nevada, and he says there are now nearly 300 so-called Yang Gangs \u2014 groups of volunteers taking direction from the campaign \u2014 in nearly every state. Much of the campaign\u2019s instructions to those volunteers so far has entailed texting and phone banking, but Fang says that he is shifting that manpower to more door-to-door canvassing in the run-up to the primary and caucus season starting in 2020. \u201cThey understand that we have a strategy and they want to be a part of it,\u201d Fang says of Yang\u2019s supporters. \u201cThey understand what needs to happen.\u201d\n\nMing, whose title was recently upgraded to director of digital and paid media, says he\u2019s grown Yang\u2019s digital team to 18 people with four or five more in the pipeline. A veteran of political campaigns, Ming says he joined Yang\u2019s team for the same reason a lot of people support the campaign: Namely, there\u2019s never been a presidential candidate who talks and acts quite like Yang. \u201cThey see someone running for president talking like they\u2019ve never heard before,\u201d Ming says, pointing to Yang\u2019s message about the need to prepare for the changing nature of work as it relates to AI and automation.\n\nMing\u2019s challenge is figuring how to use Yang\u2019s fluency with internet culture and knack for generating viral moments \u2014 whether dancing the Cupid Shuffle at a South Carolina women\u2019s workout class or crowd-surfing at an Asian-American Pacific Islander event \u2014 to expand the campaign\u2019s support beyond the devoted Yang Gangers. \u201cOne of the things that we see is it could be anything,\u201d Ming says. \u201cWe have a candidate who is very natural and internet-first in a way that many candidates aren\u2019t. We have to figure out how to take best advantage of those moments.\u201d\n\nEven with a flawlessly executed campaign, Yang\u2019s path to the nomination would involve an extraordinary run through the opening months of 2020, where one surprise win would attract fresh converts to the Yang Gang and bring an unprecedented number of new voters into the fold. But if Yang hopes to stand any chance of competing in 2020, he needs a strong performance in one of the early four primary and caucus states.\n\nSo far, Yang\u2019s best bet for winning early-state delegates looks to be New Hampshire. He has polled as high as 5 percent there without a real campaign apparatus in place. Marchand says he believes that the state\u2019s open primary system plays to Yang\u2019s advantage. Without a competitive Republican primary, he says, Yang could benefit from undeclared voters choosing to vote in the Democratic primary and throwing their weight behind an outsider candidate like Yang who hasn\u2019t shied away from shirking the party establishment.\n\n\u201cUndeclared voters are a tremendous bloc of potential support for Andrew,\u201d Marchand says. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to not get Democratic votes obviously, and we\u2019re getting Bernie voters, college voters, high-income and high-education white-collar voters. There\u2019s a nice coalition building.\u201d\n\nOf course, for all the optimism among the Yang faithful, Yang is still polling in the single digits. He ranks sixth in Real Clear Politics\u2019 national polling average, a distant 23 percentage points behind former Vice President Joe Biden. Yet looked at another way, one year ago Andrew Yang was a little-known author and former test-prep executive, while Beto O\u2019Rourke was the hottest thing in Democratic politics. Today, Yang leads O\u2019Rourke in many polls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling to grow the organization on the ground as fast as we want to,\u201d Marchand says. \u201cWe have the resources to do what we want to do. It\u2019s a matter of how fast can we do it.\u201d", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Andy Kroll", "Rolling Stone Washington Bureau Chief", "Andy Kroll'S Most Recent Stories", "Inside The Making Of Andrew Yang", "Bernie Sanders Cancels Upcoming Campaign Events After Chest Procedure", "Andrew Yang Just Raised", "Million In Three Months", "His Biggest Haul Yet", "View All"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1160824111W.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
