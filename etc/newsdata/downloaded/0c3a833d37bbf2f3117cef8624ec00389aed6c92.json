They would also safeguard the travel plans of holidaymakers as their trips would still be paid for \u2013 even if their booking firm collapses. This would save taxpayers having to cover repatriation and refunds.\n\nAny running costs faced by a booking agent would have to be covered using the margin added by the agent as a fee on top of the cost of a holiday package.\n\nGooley\u2019s intervention will pile pressure on the Government and the Civil Aviation Authority, which is due today to complete its programme to bring home 150,000 Thomas Cook customers who were stranded abroad.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday understands regulators are due to enter talks with the Government in the coming days as they seek to prevent another crash. Gooley\u2019s proposals could form part of the talks.\n\nMike Gooley, founder and chairman of Trailfinders travel agency\n\nGooley, who set up Trailfinders almost half a century ago, claims Civil Aviation Authority boss Richard Moriarty avoided introducing these changes before Thomas Cook collapsed because the firm was already dependent on using booking money to \u2018stay afloat\u2019.\n\nThomas Cook customers and many of its 9,000 staff have been angered by revelations that bosses \u2013 who built up \u00a31.7billion of debt in recent years through doomed takeover deals and financial restructurings \u2013 were paid millions of pounds.\n\nWhen the firm went bust late last month it barely had enough cash to last through to October.\n\nHundreds of thousands of customers were stranded abroad and the company was unable to pay compensation for cancelled future holidays. The CAA had to step in to launch the UK\u2019s largest ever peacetime repatriation programme.\n\nThe costs of the return flights and customer refunds are being covered by the Air Travel Organisers\u2019 Licensing (Atol) protection scheme \u2013 which is funded by a levy on travel agents \u2013 and the taxpayer. The Government could be left sharing a bill of \u00a3500million.\n\nAtol ensures that travellers are not stranded in foreign countries or left out of pocket if their travel company closes. Firms with Atol licences pay \u00a32.50 per passenger booking into the CAA\u2019s Air Travel Trust Fund.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Thomas Cook customers were stranded abroad and the company was unable to pay compensation for cancelled future holidays\n\nIn a letter to Moriarty, Gooley described the Atol scheme as \u2018misguided since its inception\u2019. He wrote: \u2018The pipeline funds generated by innocent travellers are not in any way ringfenced.\n\n\u2018All other similar transactions in society are rigidly co ntrolled and regulated while travel has always been allowed to misappropriate these future funds and use them to meet general and current running costs.\n\n\u2018Embezzlement is not too harsh a description of this common practice which without regulation fuels both the frequency and extent of the misery caused by undercapitalised operators when their business plan fails.\u2019\n\nGooley, whose company has annual revenues of more than \u00a3700million, added: \u2018The CAA is surely now obliged to implement the silver bullet urgently.\u2019", "description": "Mike Gooley, the founder and chairman of Trailfinders, has hit out at 'impotent and flawed' rules that let travel agents 'embezzle' customers' money to meet everyday running costs.", "authors": ["William Turvill For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
