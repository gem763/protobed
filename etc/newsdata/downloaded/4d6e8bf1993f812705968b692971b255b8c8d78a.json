Reminder: There are 97 days until the Iowa caucuses and 371 days until the 2020 election.\n\nAs the impeachment battle rages in Washington, Democrats\u2019 position appears to be improving up and down the ballot.\n\nProjecting current trend lines \u2014 admittedly a risky undertaking \u2014 shows it\u2019s entirely possible the party could win the presidency, the Senate and the House next November.\n\nLet\u2019s start with impeachment itself. Before news of the Ukraine scandal began to snowball, only about 40 percent of Americans supported impeachment, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polling average; a majority opposed it. Today, those numbers have pretty much flipped, with nearly 49 percent in favor and about 43 percent opposed. Ask only how people feel about starting the impeachment process, meanwhile, and the gap widens; about 52 percent say yea versus about 42 percent who say nay. Particularly problematic for Trump is the increase in support for impeachment among independents, to 47.5 percent from 33.9 percent in late September. And the latest impeachment developments \u2014 the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council plans to testify Tuesday about how troubling he found Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, and Democrats are set to begin public hearings \u2014 are unlikely to help the president\u2019s cause.\n\nIn parallel with the shift in sentiment on impeachment, Trump\u2019s approval rating has fallen from about 43 percent in late September to 40.6 percent today, while his disapproval rating has risen from 52.8 percent to 54.2 percent. These aren\u2019t huge swings, but the president\u2019s approval numbers rarely move much \u2014 Americans already know how they feel about the guy \u2014 so any movement tends to be significant. And a net approval rating of negative 13.6 percentage points heading into a reelection year is not good. For comparison, the only modern president in worse shape at this point in his presidency was Jimmy Carter; even Barack Obama, who faced similar polarization and a much worse economy, was performing about 8 points better in October 2011 than Trump is now. Carter lost reelection; Obama won.\n\nPhoto illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP, Getty Images More\n\nAt the same time, Trump is trailing by wide margins in national head-to-head matchups with each of the three leading Democratic presidential contenders. According to RealClearPolitics, Joe Biden currently leads the president by 6.7 percentage points, on average \u2014 50.1 percent to 43.4 percent. Bernie Sanders now leads Trump by 6.5 points \u2014 50 percent to 43.5 percent. And Elizabeth Warren leads Trump by 5.7 points \u2014 49.7 percent to 44 percent. It\u2019s especially significant that all three Democrats are at or near 50 percent.\n\nA presidential contest, of course, is not waged nationwide but in key Electoral College swing states. But even there, Democrats are ahead. Recent polls from Wisconsin, Florida, Minnesota, Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina all show the same thing: The top Democrats are beating Trump where it matters most. In Minnesota, which Hillary Clinton won by only 1.5 points, a Star Tribune poll shows the president losing to the leading Democrats by 9 to 12 points. In Wisconsin, which Trump carried in 2016 by less than a point, a Marquette Law School poll shows Biden beating Trump by 6, with Sanders up by 2 and Warren ahead by 1. In Florida, a University of North Florida poll shows Trump stuck at 43 percent or 44 percent; he trails Biden by 5 and Warren by 3. Even in Iowa \u2014 a state Trump carried by 9 points in 2016 \u2014 an Emerson College poll shows Trump essentially tied with Biden, Sanders and Warren.", "description": "Read more from Yahoo News: Turkey's President Erdogan bluffed Trump out of Syria. The problem for House Republicans isn\u2019t lack of targets; Democrats are defending seats in roughly 30 districts that Trump won in 2016.
