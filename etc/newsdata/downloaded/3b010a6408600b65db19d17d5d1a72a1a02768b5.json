The legislation, which has bipartisan support in the Senate and the House of Representatives, has emerged as the primary vehicle through which the U.S. government is hoping to deter China from carrying out a Tiananmen Square\u2013like crackdown against peaceful protesters and pressure it into upholding the city\u2019s special status within China. (So far Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose wife\u2019s family has extensive business dealings in China, hasn\u2019t specifically endorsed, even as he\u2019s advocated for legislative measures to preserve Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. A spokesperson for Rubio, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations in the Senate, said the senator\u2019s office did not view McConnell\u2019s failure to reference the act in a recent op-ed on Hong Kong as a slight.)\n\nAmong other things, the bill would require the secretary of state to annually certify to Congress that Hong Kong, which operates its own immigration system, judiciary, and currency, is sufficiently autonomous to maintain the favorable treatment on trade and commerce that it receives from the United States. (Hong Kong, for example, isn\u2019t subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs on the rest of China.) It would also empower the U.S. government to impose sanctions on Chinese or Hong Kong officials deemed to be undermining that autonomy or committing human-rights abuses.\n\nIn theory, this would equip the United States with plenty of economic and diplomatic leverage to influence Chinese behavior, but in practice it would be difficult to execute.", "description": "", "authors": ["Friedman", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Americas-Role-Hong-Kong"], "top_image": ""}
