They\u2019re great in any form; poached, fried, soft-boiled with soldiers, scrambled, whipped, whatever. Finding out that somewhere out there in the country is the newly-crowned Best Egg Dish of Australia delights me \u2013 hell, it eggcites me.\n\nThe 2019 Eggcellence Awards held by Australian Eggs (of course, who else) has awarded a bakery in Western Sydney with the title of Best Egg Dish today, the sacred day\u2013World Egg Day.\n\nPersonally I think we should all have a public holiday for this very special day, but whatever it\u2019s fine.\n\nYum Yum Bakery in Sydney\u2019s Guildford has picked up the coveted title for 2019 with its Awarma and egg pizza, which was voted by the public as the best googy grub out of all of the finalists.\n\nA warm flatbread baked with lamb confit a big runny egg on top, and then dusted with a light sprinkle of zataar won Yum Yum Bakery the choccies for this year, and even just looking at that pic above makes me all fuzzy and warm inside.\n\nIt looks like the perfect Sunday breakfast when you\u2019re hungover in bed and you just want to stay soft and small and warm. I wish to hoover this up immediately.\n\nNajib Haddad from Yum Yum Bakery said that the dish is his homage to the generations of his family before and after him, scrambling together his father\u2019s home in Lebanon where they\u2019d preserve lamb for over the winter months, and the weekend breakfasts that his daughters nag him for \u2013 goopy, sunny-side-up eggs.\n\n\u201cPeople often overlook the humble egg,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut in my dish it\u2019s the egg which really elevates the recipe to make it something unexpected and special.\u201d\n\nThe award-winning pizzy goes for $12 fresh out of the oven, so it\u2019s probably worth a road trip to get your lips around one of them now before there\u2019s a line halfway up the street.\n\nTake a moment to enjoy the bakery\u2019s compilation of favourite thing about eggs: popping the yolk.", "description": "The 2019 Eggcellence awards from Australian Eggs has been cracked open, and a Western Sydney bakery has nabbed the Best Egg Dish award.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/awarma-egg-pizza-site.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
