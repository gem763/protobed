Johnson is determined to achieve Brexit by the end of October with or without a deal, a move experts say could have devastating economic consequences.", "description": "The U.K.'s Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay called for a \"creative\" approach from the EU to fix the current impasse between London and Brussels.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106118077-1567937877598gettyimages-1149248996.jpg?v=1567937998", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
