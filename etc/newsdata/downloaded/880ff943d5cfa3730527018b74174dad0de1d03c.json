The information included contraception use, physical symptoms and, yes, when users had sex. (Mercifully, it seems who we have been doing it with remains out of Facebook\u2019s sweaty grasp.)\n\nMenstrual tracking apps can be incredibly useful, from knowing when your period is likely to come to managing problematic symptoms or maximising your chances of conceiving. But should we reconsider sharing information with them? It is no secret that we already give a staggering amount of data to platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. So it should come as no surprise that we are happy to share the most personal information with our phones; they\u2019ve got everything else, so why not?\n\nThe fact that we so happily punch in highly personal information into apps we can\u2019t guarantee are secure is really just the latest of example of how the measurement and quantification of even our most intimate behaviours is second nature. If someone told you they had written down every instance of when they had recently had sex into a notebook they kept by their bed, you\u2019d probably start backing away pretty rapidly. But typing it into our phones seems normal, even logical.\n\nWith so much of our private, personal information floating around in the cloud, ready to be exploited by advertisers, politicians or the platforms themselves, it may seem academic that our sex lives are also under the data microscope. But resisting this monopoly is one way to stop the commodification of our emotional life, to stop thinking of intimate, meaningful moments as simply data to be recorded, measured and shared. Three in a bed might sound fun \u2013 but we need to think a little deeper about who we have invited under the bedsheets when our phones are in the picture, too.", "description": "Millions of women manage their menstrual cycles with period-tracking apps - and it\u2019s emerged that some of the trackers have been sharing personal data with Facebook", "authors": ["Emily Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10348bca00a1590dd4a01bfa5035e305d87b2a8a/0_346_5197_3119/master/5197.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=898f661198c42fdf1fc740e68fbaa314", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
