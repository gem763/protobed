Are you downcast? Of course not. We are Conservatives and we get on with serving the people \u2013 and speaking of service I should begin by paying tribute to my predecessor Theresa, I know the whole of conference remains full of gratitude to you, and to Philip May, for your patience and your forbearance, and yes, we will continue with the work of tackling domestic violence and modern slavery and building on your legacy\n\nJohnson begins with a dig at his predecessors, Theresa May and David Cameron, by announcing that he as prime minister is presiding over the most successful conference in years. His subsequent praise for May therefore sounds slightly flat and disingenuous \u2013 made even more awkward by her seeming absence from the audience. His pledge to carry forward her legacy on domestic violence and modern slavery suggests he only wants to continue with limited aspects of her premiership and his thanks to her husband for his \u201cpatience and forbearance\u201d also comes across as slightly insulting.\n\nIf parliament were a laptop, then the screen would be showing the pizza wheel of doom. If parliament were a school, Ofsted would be shutting it down. If parliament were a reality TV show the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle by now. But at least we could have watched the Speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle. And the sad truth is that voters have more say over I\u2019m a Celebrity ... than they do over this House of Commons, which refuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election.\n\nThis is populist rhetoric pure and simple from Johnson. He is whipping up anger against parliament among Brexit supporters, in effect accusing it of blocking Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. The reality is that Eurosceptics as much as opposition parties blocked May\u2019s deal, and the Conservatives have refused to pivot to a softer Brexit that could gain cross-party support. It is all part of the prime minister\u2019s framing of politics as the people versus parliament, with Johnson claiming to be on the side of the people who voted for Brexit in 2016.\n\nJust at the moment when voters are desperate for us to focus on their priorities, we are continuing to chew the supermasticated subject of Brexit, when what people want, what leavers want, what remainers want, what the whole world wants, is to be calmly and sensibly done with the subject and to move on, and that is why we are coming out of the EU on October 31 come what may, conference. Let\u2019s get Brexit done. We can, we must and we will, even though things have not been made easier by the surrender bill.\n\nJohnson repeats the strapline of the Conservative conference: \u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done.\u201d His theory is that voters are fed up with Brexit and just want it dealt with. However, the Benn act \u2013 officially called the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019, which he controversially calls the \u201csurrender bill\u201d \u2013 will prevent him doing so without a Brexit deal, and he offers no suggestions for how 31 October is a realistic date for the UK\u2019s departure if an agreement with the EU cannot be reached.\n\nLet\u2019s get this thing done \u2013 and then let\u2019s get ready to make our case to the country against the fratricidal antisemitic Marxists who were in Brighton last week. Last week Jeremy Corbyn had a number of damaging and retrograde ideas in his speech: he wants a four-day week, which would slash the wages of people on low incomes; he wants to ban private schools and expropriate their property, even though it would cost the taxpayer \u00a37bn to educate the kids; he wants to stamp out excellence in schools by banning Ofsted, the inspectors who ensure that schools are safe for our children.\n\nJohnson\u2019s attack lines on Labour in colourful language give a taste of the rhetoric to come in a forthcoming general election. This passage includes some misrepresentations of Labour policy already: for example, the party\u2019s four-day working week policy comes with a guarantee that there would be no loss of income.\n\nWe have the astonishing spectacle of the leader of the opposition being prevented by his colleagues from engaging in his constitutional function, which is to try to remove me from office ... though it now appears that the SNP may yet try to bundle him towards the throne like some Konstantin Chernenko figure, reluctantly propelled to office in a Kremlin coup, so that they get on with their programme for total national discord, turning the whole of 2020, which should be a great year for this country, into the chaos and cacophony of two more referendums: a second referendum on Scottish independence ... and a second referendum on the EU.\n\nThis will be another theme of an election: the possibility of a Labour pact with the SNP. Johnson is at work already on the strategy that was so successful for Cameron against Ed Miliband in 2015, where English voters were repeatedly shown images of Labour in the pocket of the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon. There is also an attempt to link Labour with Russia with a relatively obscure reference to a Kremlin coup.\n\n\n\nToday in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals, which provide a compromise for both sides. We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland. We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement. And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland, we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border. And at the same time we will allow the UK \u2013 whole and entire \u2013 to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start ... If we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time. Then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal.\n\nJohnson sets out the bare bones of what he is offering the EU: the whole of the UK will withdraw from the customs union but Northern Ireland would stay in regulatory zones with Ireland for food at least and maybe other goods. Contained within it is a threat to the EU that they will get the blame if they dismiss his proposals out of hand and push the UK towards a no-deal Brexit. At this point, there is no acknowledgement of the Benn act, which forbids such an outcome.\n\nI am going to quote that supreme authority in my family \u2013 my mother (and by the way for keen students of the divisions in my family you might know that I have kept the ace up my sleeve \u2013 my mother voted leave). And my mother taught me to believe strongly in the equal importance, the equal dignity, the equal worth of every human being on the planet, and that may sound banal but it is not. And there is one institution that sums up that idea. The NHS is holy to the people of this country because of the simple beauty of its principle that it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where you come from but when you are sick the whole country figuratively gathers at your bedside.\n\nThis is the beginning of a very purple passage about the NHS, designed to overturn voters\u2019 perception that the Tories cannot be trusted with the health service. There was nothing new in terms of policy on the NHS, but he referenced plans to improve hospitals and build more over the next decade. Johnson also makes a very rare reference to his mother and family divisions over Brexit, as he is usually extremely cautious about declining to mention his personal life.\n\nI will tell you that it is by raising the productivity of the whole of the UK, not with socialism, not with deranged and ruinous plans borrowed from the playbook of Bolivarian revolutionary Venezuela but by creating the economic platform for dynamic free-market capitalism.\n\nThis is another flowery section attacking Corbyn in language that sounds more like a newspaper column than a political speech. It sets the scene once again for electoral battle lines where the Conservatives will paint Labour as economically incompetent, even though most businesses and mainstream economists are scathing about Johnson\u2019s readiness to pursue a no-deal Brexit and the consequences on the country\u2019s prosperity.\n\nIt is one of the many bizarre features of the SNP that in spite of being called names like Salmond and Sturgeon they are committed to handing back those fish to the control of the EU. We want to turbo-charge the Scottish fishing sector; they would allow Brussels to charge for our turbot.\n\nThe speech is full of wild metaphors and vivid images but light on jokes for a Johnson event. A quip about fish probably got the biggest laugh in the hall from a very supportive crowd of MPs and activists.\n\nLet\u2019s get on with sensible, moderate one-nation but tax-cutting Tory government and figuratively if not literally let us send Jeremy Corbyn into orbit where he belongs. Let\u2019s get Brexit done. Let\u2019s bring our country together.\n\nJohnson ends with a summary of his electoral strategy - putting Brexit to bed and persuading voters that he is actually a one-nation Tory politician in spite of his hardline approach to the EU and nationalist rhetoric. His programme will be cutting taxes at the same time as promising more spending on public services \u2013 a combination of left and right wing that appears to have abandoned the fiscal restraint of the Cameron and George Osborne era. However, settling Brexit and moving on to a domestic agenda is obviously easier said than done.\n\n", "description": "In keynote address, the PM gives a taste of the rhetoric he might employ for an election", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c182d4be25d341360f919eb1731c6612306c3953/0_154_4618_2771/master/4618.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e45f706e58b9124d4a71795de7addf8f"}
