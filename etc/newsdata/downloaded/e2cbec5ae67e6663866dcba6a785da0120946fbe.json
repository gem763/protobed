Magecart attacks are a type of hack that focuses on e-commerce. Attackers typically target online stores with the goal of scraping and stealing credit card information. The number of such attacks has been growing in recent years with many companies unaware that their servers have been compromised. Hacks may persist for weeks, months, or even years without being noticed.\n\nThe number of such hacks has been increasing, researchers say, and has affected more than 18,000 online stores in the pas few months.\n\nA now infamous Magecart attack on British Airways compromised nearly 400,000 customers' credit car information last year.\n\nAccording to the security firm RiskIQ, Magecart hacks have become particularly perilous for e-commerce companies since they often don't have access to the underlying code that runs their online stores.\n\nThis allows hackers to remain undetected in servers for long periods of time that can range from weeks, to months, or even years.\n\n'Skimming code can exist on a breached website for weeks, months, or even indefinitely, victimizing any visitor that makes purchases on that site,' writes RiskIQ.", "description": "Among the affected parties are the Sesame Street Live online store which sells various merchandise from the popular kids show and the official website for the late painting icon, Bob Ross.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/13731472-0-image-a-11_1570570017336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
