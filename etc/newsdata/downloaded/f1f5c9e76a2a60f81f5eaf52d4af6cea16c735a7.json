Begin your day here in Ban Jelacic Square where the iconic equestrian statue of Count Josip Jelacic and an elegant sunken fountain contrast with the bustle of the tram stops on one side and the cafes on the other.\n\n\n\nStop for a drink or snack in the covered pavilion that is the heart of the city's Advent celebrations, then head out to wander the stalls of the surrounding Christmas market and explore the rest of the city. Don't miss the short funicular ride to the ancient upper town, Gradec, or the live nativity scene that springs up in front of the city's Neo Gothic cathedral. In the surrounding parks the paths are strung with lanterns, and you'll find stalls are filled with artists\u2019 wares and wintertime treats like strukle - a warm, sweet pastry. The sight of the skaters on Tomislav Square\u2019s vast ice rink; the nosy, fun-filled combination of great food and live music on offer at the Fooling Around market; and the traditional market in Zrinjevac Park, all contribute to a wonderful day.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://holidays.theguardian.com/tourimg.php?a=img&img=61cab9086719f5d168feacad74ae86a2"}
