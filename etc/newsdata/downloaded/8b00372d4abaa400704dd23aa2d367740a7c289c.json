Perhaps it was the markets not seeing any further easing potential, essentially viewing the central bank as \u2018tapped out\u2019.\n\nThis view is supported by ECB President Draghi\u2019s call for fiscal stimulus to complement monetary policy. Draghi has long advocated for fiscal measures but the backdrop seems a bit different this time. After all, inflation continues to run below targets after five years of loose policy.\n\nI think there is still a lot of uncertainty around the catalyst for the EUR/USD rally yesterday. However, there are some clear technical signals in play. Further, positioning and sentiment cannot be ignored at this stage.\n\nIt seems likely that several traders got caught on the wrong side of the trade yesterday. For this reason, I expect that EUR/USD declines will continue to be short-lived as sellers cover.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, there is a down trendline in play that originates from a high posted in late June. So far, in the early day, sellers have managed to defend the trendline.\n\nEURUSD Daily Chart More\n\nAhead of the meeting, there were several resistance areas that capped rallies in EUR/USD. Essentially, there was a confluence near 1.1060 that included the 20-day moving average and the 100 moving average on a 4-hour chart.\n\nThat confluence area has broken to set a bullish tone. The hurdle now is the downtrend line which carries confluence with the 200 moving average on a 4-hour chart.\n\nEURUSD 4-Hour Chart More\n\nThe 1.1060 area continues to be significant on a daily close basis. If sellers manage to drive the pair below it and keep it there by the end of the day, it might trigger a further decline.\n\nConsidering the recent upward momentum, the pair carries a bullish bias. Although the above-mentioned hurdle, in around 1.1100, remains in focus.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEUR/USD reversed abruptly on Thursday and the upward momentum suggests the potential for further upside.\n\nThe pair is held by a confluence of resistance from an 11-week down trendline and the 200 MA on a 4-hour chart.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "It was a volatile day for EUR/USD on Thursday.
