Episode 11 is a flash-forward. It begins and ends with an \u201cEquity Task Force\u201d created by Gov. Jay Inslee which seems to be doing its best to lead the entire state of Washington down the same path Evergreen State followed two years ago.\n\nJust three weeks ago, President George Bridges told the Equity Task Force, \u201cWe at Evergreen are beginning to understand how our own policies and practices work to the disadvantage of some of our students\u2026\u201d Bridges notes that a similar Equity Council was created at Evergreen to get everyone on board with the \u201cequity mindset.\u201d The fact that Bridges doesn\u2019t seem to feel any sense of shame about the result of his efforts at Evergreen suggests he hasn\u2019t learned anything from the experience.\n\nThe center of this episode looks back at the series of protests which preceded the campus takeover at the end of the school year. Particular attention is given to a protest that took place at the swearing-in of Chief Stacy Brown as the school\u2019s new Chief of Police. Students took over the meeting and screamed obscenities at Brown and her young daughter. Eventually, the event was canceled and students were left to shout anti-police slogans in an empty room. \u201cThe students pretty much ran the show,\u201d Deputy Dave Pearsall told the Washington State Senate\u2019s Law and Justice Committee.\n\nWhen President Bridges was questioned about this by the Committee, he claimed that if it had been up to him he would have \u201cimposed a more severe sanction\u201d on the two students who led that protest. But those were the same two students who had led all of the other campus protests up to that point, including the ones at which Bridges stood leaning against the wall, doing nothing. So the idea that he was eager to get tough with out-of-control protesters doesn\u2019t stand up to any scrutiny at all.\n\nJumping back to the present day, filmmaker Benjamin Boyce lets you see the Washington state Equity Task Force seemingly following the same path as Evergreen, starting with an effort to redefine racism so that it is explicitly focused on white supremacy. Boyce concludes, \u201cThey want to make racism linked directly to whiteness. What does this say about a government that is implementing a racial categorization and then, probably, giving power to agencies to openly discriminate based on race? Where does that head?\u201d\n\nThe answer is to the kind of meltdown we saw at Evergreen State College. If you prime people with the idea they are victims of another racial group\u2019s racial domination, at least a small group of people will react by claiming they are living in a state of constant dread, one which justifies their endless demands for social control needed to create a safe space. Unfortunately, Democrats in Washington state seems to think Evergreen was a successful pilot program rather than a disaster to be avoided at all costs.
