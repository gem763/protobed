Ed Rendell calls Elizabeth Warren a 'hypocrite'", "language": "en", "text": "Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell says Sen. Elizabeth Warren is a being \u201chypocrite\u201d for criticizing her 2020 presidential rivals for raising money from the wealthy donors that she has relied on in the past and is still benefiting from.\n\nIn a Washington Post op-ed, Mr. Rendell, who has endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden for president, wrote he has been a big fan of Ms. Warren, but said the Massachusetts Democrat\u2019s anti-big donor pledge rings hollow.\n\n\u201cI like her a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cToo bad she\u2019s a hypocrite.\u201d\n\nMr. Rendell highlighted how Ms. Warren transferred $10.4 million from her Senate reelection campaign \u2014 including money from the kinds of big donor fundraisers she criticizes on the campaign trail \u2014 into her presidential bid, giving her a head start on most of her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Rendell accused her of \u201ctrying to have it both ways \u2014 get the political upside from eschewing donations from higher-level donor and running a grass-roots campaign, while at the same time using money obtained from those donors in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe beef is personal, he said, noting that Ms. Warren was happy to attend private fundraisers and take his money before she launched her presidential bid.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Rendell said, he received a \u201cglowing, handwritten thank-you letter from her for my hard work.\u201d\n\nSince then, though, she has criticized former Mr. Biden for holding a campaign kickoff in Philadelphia, where Mr. Rendell served as mayor, with some of the same wealthy donors that cut checks to her Senate bid.\n\n\u201cWell, I helped organize that affair, and I though her attack was extremely hypocritical because nearly 20 of us who attended the Biden fundraiser had also given her $2,000 or more in 2018 at close-door fundraisers in \u2018swanky\u2019 locations,\u201d he said. \u201cWarren didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble taking our money in 2018, but suddenly we were power brokers and influence peddlers in 2019.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren has been on the rise in the 2020 Democratic presidential race.\n\nThe criticism comes as she prepared to square off with Mr. Biden and eight of her rivals at the third presidential debate in Houston.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
