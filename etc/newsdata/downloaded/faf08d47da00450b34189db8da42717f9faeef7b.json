We can build on something, I think. Ole just needs that opportunity to create the culture again.\"", "description": "No2 says players were worked too hard after Solskjaer took charge - and insists manager needs more time to build his own team", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20634192.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wolverhampton-Wanderers-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
