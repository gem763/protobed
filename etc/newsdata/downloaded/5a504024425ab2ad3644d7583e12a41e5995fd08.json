This is deadly serious. This is Mussolini.'\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham is describing the move as a cost-saving measure.\n\nRetired four-star general Barry McCaffrey (left) compared President Trump (right) to Italian fascist wartime dictator Benito Mussolini over the administration's decision to order federal agencies to cancel subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post\n\nMcCaffrey tweeted: 'No room for HUMOROUS media coverage. This is deadly serious. This is Mussolini'\n\nGrisham said that 'not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving for taxpayers - hundreds of thousands of dollars.'\n\nTrump is often critical of the two newspapers and said in a Fox News interview on Monday that 'we don't want' the Times in the White House anymore, and 'we're going to probably terminate that and The Washington Post.'\n\nWhite House aides say the print editions of the newspaper are no longer coming into the White House, though online access continues.\n\nThe White House's subscriptions ended Tuesday.\n\nIt's unclear how the White House will be able to stop Cabinet agencies, VA hospitals and military bases from subscribing to two of America's most widely read newspapers.\n\nBoth offer free digital subscriptions to federal government employees and servicemen and women whose email addresses end in '.gov' or '.mil.'\n\nTrump is an avid newspaper reader, but Grisham confirmed to Politico that 'we won't be renewing' the dead-tree editions.\n\nThe White House's other newspaper subscriptions are still active, including Financial Times, The Hill, the New York Post, Politico, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times and USA Today.\n\nThe president did not appear to be referring to the White House access Times and Post reporters enjoy, and no one at the White House has made a move to restrict West Wing access to the papers' online editions.\n\nA Bloomberg reporter captured a photo on Thursday of a side table near the press secretary's office where newspapers are spread out daily for staff to read. the Times and Post were not among them.\n\nJonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said on Thursday, 'I have no doubt the hardworking reporters of The New York Times and Washington Post will continue to do quality journalism, regardless of whether the president acknowledges he reads them.\n\n'Pretending to ignore the work of a free press won't make the news go away or stop reporters from informing the public and holding those in power accountable.'\n\nA Bloomberg reporter captured a photo on Thursday of a side table near the press secretary's office where newspapers are spread out daily for staff to read. the Times and Post were not among them\n\nMcCaffrey, who works as a paid analyst for NBC News, has been a frequent critic of the president.\n\nDuring a television appearance last week, McCaffrey said Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from a border region in northern Syria was 'inexplicable.'\n\nThe decision paved the way for a Turkish incursion into Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria - this after years during which the Kurds fought alongside American forces against ISIS.\n\n'Mr Trump seems to have single-handedly and unilaterally precipitated a national security crisis in the Middle East,' McCaffrey said.\n\nLast year, McCaffrey made headlines when he accused Trump of being a threat to national security by not being strongly opposed to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n'It is apparent that he is for some unknown reason under the sway of Mr. Putin,' McCaffrey told MSNBC.", "description": "Barry McCaffrey (left) compared President Trump (right) to Benito Mussolini over administration's decision to cancel subscriptions to New York Times and Washington Post.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/13/20215728-0-image-a-4_1572094051624.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
