'Murphy\u2019s law!'\n\nEarlier, Prosecutor Carmen Matteo had told the court the case against Tilley was strong and opposed any form of bail, including home detention.\n\nMs Matteo told the court that it was alleged the killer was injured during the attack and as well as leaving blood behind in Mrs Poll's handbag, there was also blood on a filing cabinet and a door.\n\nTilley (pictured) was extradited from Victoria to South Australia almost two weeks ago after new analysis of blood found on Ms Poll's handbag linked him to the murder\n\nHis brother and other family members had offered up a $50,000 surety and the brother (pictured) was willing to have Tilley stay with him if he was granted bail\n\nMrs Poll, a mother of two, was stabbed to death while working at the Salisbury Sands & McDougall store during what police believe was a robbery-gone-wrong.\n\nThe lights were off and the shop was shut but the front door remained ajar while the 36-year-old counted the day's takings.\n\nA man entered and attacked Mrs Poll, who tried to escape through a back room but was stabbed to death in what police said was a vicious and sustained killing.\n\nMs Matteo told the court because the allegations against Tilley were so serious, there was an inherent risk he would abscond.\n\nBut Craig Caldicott, for the accused, said there was no suggestion he would flee and family members were willing to put up $50,000 in guarantees.\n\nHe said Tilley only expected to be released on home detention with electronic monitoring which would prevent him moving more than eight metres from his brother's house.\n\nMrs Poll, a mother of two, was stabbed to death in 1993 while working at the Salisbury Sands & McDougall store during what police believe was a robbery-gone-wrong\n\nMr Caldicott said there were also no allegations of any offending by Tilley before or after the alleged murder and his client intended to plead not guilty to the murder charge.\n\nWith the case not returning to court until September next year, a trial could be two years away and he said it would be unfair to keep Tilley in custody for so long.\n\nMagistrate Simon Smart urged prosecutors to supply material to the defence as soon as possible to help progress the case but said the seriousness of the allegations outweighed any presumption of bail and refused the application.\n\nOutside the court, Mr Caldicott said he would appeal to the Supreme Court.", "description": "The brother of cold case murder accused Matthew Tilley has lashed out at a journalist outside court, furiously pulling a microphone from his hand before sheepishly handing it back.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia", "Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/06/19284624-0-image-a-13_1570167667176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
