Failure to recognize family and friends, inability to perform even simple tasks\u2026it\u2019s a dreadful, all too frequent reality for millions, especially among those over 65. But you can push back and work toward preventing dementia.\n\nNot game over\u2014game on\n\nLike many other diseases, dementia was once considered an inevitable outcome of age. While it\u2019s true that those over 65 have double the risk of developing dementia, lifestyle and behavioral changes can help us flourish, not founder, in our later years.\n\nHere are our top 10 dementia prevention practices. They\u2019re in no particular order because each one can play a leading role in fighting dementia.\n\n1. Prevent dementia bite by bite\n\nA healthy diet is the indispensible bedrock of disease prevention. I can\u2019t over-emphasize\u2014poor diet means poor health.\n\nHere are some basic dietary rules to follow.\n\nDo eat:\n\n100% whole grains\n\nComplex carbohydrates\n\nAim for 5-10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. The more colors the better.\n\nHealthy fats such as nuts, seeds, avocado, and olive oil\n\nLean proteins such as legumes, chicken, and fish\n\nLow glycemic fruit like berries\n\nDon\u2019t eat:\n\nProcessed foods\n\nMore than two servings of meat a day. Aim for one.\n\nRefined carbohydrates like white or non-whole-grain bread, crackers, pasta, and pastries\n\nAdded sugars and high-fructose corn syrup\n\nAll of these forbidden foods are mainstays of the Standard American Diet\u2014SAD for short. Sad is how you\u2019ll feel if you eat that way on a regular basis, because the SAD is a surefire path to being overweight, obese, and diabetic with an increased likelihood of stroke, heart attack, and cancer.\n\nWhat to do: Avoid eating like most Americans eat. Stick to the \u201cDos\u201d and avoid, whenever possible, the \u201cDon\u2019ts\u201d.\n\n2. Get exercised against dementia\n\nExercise protects your brain by reducing bloodstream cortisol levels. That\u2019s fine protection against:\n\nHigher blood pressure\n\nHigher blood glucose levels\n\nHigher risk of vascular damage\n\nInhibited growth of nerve cells needed for memory\n\nWhat to do: If you\u2019re not physically and mentally active, your dementia risk increases. So just get moving. Every little bit of movement, even a brisk walk after lunch, gives you proven dementia protection. Aim for at least 10-15 minutes every day and gradually increase as you\u2019re able.\n\n3. Don\u2019t be a stranger\u2014socialize\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether social isolation is a symptom or a cause of dementia. But research tells us that it\u2019s a certain risk factor.\n\nThe theory is that social isolation is like impaired hearing. Our brains need stimulation to thrive. What\u2019s more stimulating than people you enjoy? Isolation wraps you in a dull, gray blanket. Good conversation, or any other way to be with others, even in silence, turns gray into brightly colored.\n\nWhat to do: Be the life of the party. Bring company to you or get out and find it. Book clubs, churches or temples, museums, concerts, classes like cooking, tai chi, yoga\u2026and there are any number of kind volunteers who can help you navigate mobility or transportation challenges.\n\n4. Fight dementia in your sleep.\n\nOur Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls sleep deprivation a public health epidemic\u2014people who have difficulty sleeping have an increased risk of developing dementia.\n\nWhy? When we sleep, our brains flush away amyloid plaque. This is like arterial plaque\u2014nasty, sticky stuff that builds up and scrambles or obstructs huge numbers of vital communication pathways linking different parts of the brain. The longer it goes uncorrected, the more scrambled your brain becomes.\n\nAmyloid plaque is a major presence in people with Alzheimer\u2019s. Given the overlap between Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, we can assume the same dynamics are in play.\n\nWhat to do: You have abundant choices when it comes to ensuring good sleep. Healthy diet and exercise top the list. Also recommended:\n\nSetting a regular time for sleep\n\nStopping eating 3 \u2013 4 hours before bed\n\nClose laptops and turn off TVs and cell phones at least two hours before bedtime\u2014the blue light from their screens depletes vital melatonin (the top sleep hormone)\n\nMeditation\n\nIf you need extra help, there are plenty of safe, natural choices. Melatonin is a favorite go-to. Start with 1 mg about 30-60 minutes before bedtime. If that doesn\u2019t work after a few nights, try 2 or 3 mg.\n\n5. Stress and dementia\u2014the unhappy couple.\n\nWe don\u2019t know with certainty that stress causes dementia. But we do know but it plays a critical role in opening the door to that and a long list of other health threats.\n\nStress tells the brain to release the hormone cortisol. When stress and its elevated cortisol levels are chronic, they team up to create dementia and other learning and memory problems.\n\nSo there\u2019s a clear link: reduced stress means reduced likelihood of dementia.\n\nBut how, you ask, can I de-stress in this crazy world?\n\nWhat to do: Find hobbies, habits and activities that focus on the positive in your life. That may include reading, exercising, meditation, yoga, tai chi, massage, socializing with friends or family members, or therapy.\n\n6. Think and play dementia away.\n\nAn active brain is a healthy brain. That\u2019s why board games and card games, crossword puzzles and jigsaw puzzles, soduko, and the like are certified \u201cbrain-healthy\u201d activities. They challenge different parts of your brain, demanding that you remember things both past and present\u2014\u201cWhat was that chemistry teacher\u2019s name? What\u2019s a 6-letter word that means unimportant?\u201d\n\nIncredibly, we now know that these \u201cplay\u201d activities actually grow new brain cells, and protect existing ones. The old belief\u2014that our brains inevitably shrink with age\u2014is no more.\n\n7. Think fasting for dementia prevention\n\nNo, I\u2019m not suggesting you go days without food. But brain and body are working hard, around the clock, every minute of every day. When you work that hard, your body needs some time off.\n\nSo \u201cintermittent fasting\u201d is a great way to do just that. One way to do this is to only eat between the hours of noon and 8pm. That gives your digestive system and, in turn, your brain and body, a 16 hour break every day. Not a big ask in exchange for dementia prevention. And once you get used to it, you\u2019ll rarely feel hungry \u2013 you may even drop a few unwanted pounds along the way.\n\nThere are many fasting variants online, which allow for juice or tea or vegetable broth. Ask your doctor what\u2019s best for you.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\n8. Sound dementia protection\n\nWe\u2019re not sure as to the intricate chemistry, but the empirical evidence is convincing: even modest hearing impairment can signal increased dementia risk.\n\nThis outcome has historically been attributed to age. Yes, our hearing can decline as we grow older, but that\u2019s not a guaranteed ticket to dementia.\n\nOne expert suggests there\u2019s a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d dynamic.\n\nThe sounds of our world make constant demands on our brains, keeping them active and healthy. Less hearing means less of that stimulation, meaning an open door to dementia.\n\nWhat to do: Get your hearing checked and get a hearing aid if needed. Today\u2019s models are ingenious, all but invisible, and life-changing effective.\n\n9. Take brainpower supplements\n\nHelp is here, in these natural, safe, and proven effective forms:\n\nCurcumin\n\nOmega-3 essential fatty acids (EFA)\n\nB-vitamins, especially B12 and folate\n\nGingko\n\nRhodiola\n\nCurcumin: If it only calmed and prevented inflammation, curcumin would get a big medal. But it also prevents a dangerous type of plaque that smothers brain cells, and relentlessly sweeps away toxins and free radicals.\n\nWhat to do: Make curcumin your daily dementia fighter\u20141,500 mg over the course of the day. Get a formulation with enhanced bioavailability to ensure your body gets the most benefit.\n\nOmega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) can prevent and reduce the progression of dementia. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an EFA that also protects against other dementia risk factors like, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n\nWhat to do: Up to 3,000 mg per day. Make sure the combined EPA and DHA content is at least 1,000 mg.\n\nB-vitamins. B12 deficiency increases the risk of cognitive impairment, especially among people over 50. In fact, many cases of dementia are actually long-undiagnosed B12 deficiencies, which supplemental B12 can fix.\n\nWe don\u2019t fully absorb B12 as we age. So even B-rich veggies\u2014spinach, kale, broccoli, green peas, and others don\u2019t pack the B punch of yesteryear.\n\nWhat to do: 6 mcg of a B12 supplement daily.\n\nGingko. One of the oldest living trees we know is said to be 2,500 years old. It\u2019s a gingko tree. Hmmm\u2026do anti-aging secrets lurk within?\n\nOf course. But the secret\u2019s out. Gingko can:\n\nImprove memory\n\nProtect and improve mental processing speed\n\nRelieve and reduce symptoms of dementia\n\nNumerous studies confirm that ginkgo does that and more.\n\nIn a six-month study, patients over 50, with mild to moderate memory impairment, received a ginkgo supplement or a placebo.\n\nGinkgo boosted cognitive function\u2014response speed on computerized tests was significantly better than in the placebo group.\n\nAnother study concluded that ginkgo appears to stabilize, and often improve, cognitive performance of dementia patients, and to support short-term memory.\n\nThere\u2019s a library full of similar data.\n\nWhat to do: Give ginkgo a try after consulting with your doctor. Dosages will vary depending on your health goals.\n\nRhodiola. From the cold Arctic regions to your local pharmacy comes this time-tested, healing herb. It\u2019s earned its reputation as an adaptogen by helping the body adapt to and be rid of multiple threats, including those that can lead to dementia.\n\nOne placebo-controlled study gave rhodiola to healthy, young, night-duty physicians, then tested them for their cognitive performance and mental fatigue during their shift, including:\n\nAssociative thinking\n\nShort-term memory\n\nCalculation skills\n\nAbility to concentrate\n\nSpeed of audio-visual perception\n\nA significant improvement was found in the rhodiola group.\n\nWhat to do: Different extracts of the rhodiola plant have been studied for efficacy in improving mental \u201csharpness.\u201d You and your doctor should determine the dosage best for you.\n\n10. Avoid drugs linked to dementia\n\nRecent (April, 2018) research linked prescription drugs called anticholinergics to an increased risk of future dementia. Anticholinergics block the brain\u2019s production of acetylcholine \u2013 a chemical that\u2019s vital to creating and storing memories. Variants of these drugs are prescribed to reduce cognitive impairment in Parkinson\u2019s patients. But the common cold and allergy medicine, Benedryl, is also an anticholinergic. The study found \u201ca robust association between some classes of anticholinergic drugs and future dementia.\u201d\n\nWhat to do: A long list of prescription meds have similar downsides. If you\u2019re taking an anticholinergic drug (a quick web search can confirm), please make sure with your doctor that it\u2019s not one that\u2019s proved hazardous to your cognitive health. There are surely safer alternatives.\n\nFight the winning fight\n\nWe have an unprecedented amount of knowledge today, ready to help treat, and even better, prevent dementia. So for millions of people fighting the good fight against cognitive decline, there\u2019s a bright new world of hope, and a fighting chance to delay, blunt, or prevent this dreaded disease.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
