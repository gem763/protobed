Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn instead wants to win an election and then hold a second referendum, offering a choice between remaining in the EU and a new Labour-negotiated exit deal.\n\nSo, how would their alternative plan work?\n\nSTEP ONE: Delay Brexit to avoid leaving without a deal\n\nLabour argues that leaving the EU without a deal would cause economic disruption and job losses.\n\nTo prevent this, the party helped pass a law which requires Johnson to ask the EU to delay Brexit until Jan. 31, 2020. The law applies if Johnson is unable to agree an exit deal that is then approved by parliament, or he fails to get parliament\u2019s permission to leave without a deal.\n\nHowever, Labour remains concerned that Johnson could simply ignore this law or find a loophole to try to force a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31. The government says it will stick to the law, but \u201ctest to the limit\u201d what is required by it.\n\nSTEP TWO: Call an election\n\nLabour argues that an early general election is necessary to defeat Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party and allow Labour to pursue its own exit strategy.\n\nBut, the party says an election should only be held once the risk of no deal has been eliminated, and twice rejected Johnson\u2019s attempts to call an election earlier this month.\n\nLabour would back an election if he requests a delay to Brexit.\n\nSTEP THREE: Promise a new Brexit referendum\n\nLabour says it would campaign in any election on a promise to hold a second referendum on leaving the EU.\n\nThe party says this referendum should be a choice between a credible offer to leave the EU and a choice to remain in the bloc.\n\nSTEP FOUR: Win an election\n\nMost recent opinion polls put Labour behind the Conservatives, but the gap varies widely. In the three most recent surveys, Labour trails by 12, 9, and 1 percentage points.\n\nSTEP FIVE: Negotiate a new Brexit deal\n\nLabour says it would negotiate a different exit arrangement with the EU, based around a new customs union, a close single market relationship, which it has yet to define, and guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.\n\nSTEP SIX: Hold a referendum\n\nLabour would put this new deal to a public vote, alongside the choice to remain in the EU.\n\nThe party has not said which option it would campaign for.\n\nSome members of the party, including senior members of Corbyn\u2019s team, have indicated they would campaign to remain.\n\nCorbyn said in an newspaper article on Wednesday: \u201cI will pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.\u201d", "description": "Britain's opposition Labour Party wants to do everything it can to stop Prime Minister Boris Johnson taking the country out of the European Union without a deal next month, and will also reject any new deal he is able to strike with Brussels.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431211685&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0U9", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
