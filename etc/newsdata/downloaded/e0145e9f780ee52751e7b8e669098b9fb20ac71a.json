The Stockton, Calif. native pointed at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the UFC for the withdrawal and claimed \u201cthey\u201d wanted him to stay quiet about the issue.\n\nApproximately 40 minutes after Diaz sent his departure announcement into the Twittersphere, \u201cGambred\u201d made an attempt to pump the breaks on any talk of the fight being cancelled. With or without USADA, Masvidal indicated he plans on fighting Diaz on Nov. 2.\n\nYou not the baddest mofo in the game (i am) but you are one of the cleanest mofo\u2019s @NateDiaz209 I\u2019ll see you nov 2. I know your name is clean. I don\u2019t need @usantidoping to tell me shit! \u2014 Jorge Masvidal UFC (@GamebredFighter) October 24, 2019\n\nMasvidal and Diaz were set to square off for the first (and likely only) \u201cBMF\u201d belt in UFC history. The card was one of the UFC\u2019s marquee events of the year, with Masvidal and Diaz headlining the card. No comment from the UFC has been provided yet. The event is just ten days away.\n\nYour all on steroids not me pic.twitter.com/ykrZmRIoPS \u2014 Nathan Diaz (@NateDiaz209) October 24, 2019\n\nGallery Photos: Jorge Masvidal through the years view 44 images", "description": "Approximately 40 minutes after Diaz sent his departure announcement into the Twittersphere, \"Gambred\" made an attempt to pump the breaks on any talk of the fight being cancelled.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/jorge-masvidal-ufc-244-press-conference-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
