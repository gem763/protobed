accessible and affordable housing and transport; health care and fair access to education.\n\nZamzam Ibrahim, NUS national president said: \u201cWhile our external environment is somewhat turbulent, and continues to be uncertain, we\u2019ve still been able to launch a priority campaign focused on delivering a sustainable, accessible, life-long, funded solution to our broken education system and our biggest ever annual voter registration campaign for young people, that\u2019s already showing results.\n\n\u201cWhile our plan contains ambitions beyond our year, it is founded in the reforms that members have told us they want, and the needs of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s students.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking to work with our members and students more closely in coming months as we launch other initiatives that support the delivery of our 10-point plan.\u201d\n\nA UUK spokeswoman said: \u201cMany institutions have taken on board the need to have a more inclusive curriculum.\n\n\u201cOur work suggests several universities are reviewing their curriculums as well as conducting liberation or decolonisation activities in co-ordination with students\u2019 unions and individuals.\n\n\u201cMany are at the early phase and have not been rolled out across entire institutions.\u201d", "description": "A plan published by the National Union of Students says some parts of the sector `have propagated systems that assure white privilege\u00b4.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/09/wire-19876028-1571388551-756_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
