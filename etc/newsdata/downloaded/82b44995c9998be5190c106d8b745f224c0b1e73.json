A fitter England won a Grand Slam in his first Six Nations and were on a roll that would eventually end in a world-record equalling run of 18 consecutive Test wins against major opposition.\n\nJones, however, had told biographer Donald McRae in 2016: \u201cWait until the third season, mate. We might hit a bit of a low then.\u201d\n\nHis words proved prophetic, with England losing five matches in a row in 2018, but Jones never wavered in the belief that England could win the World Cup in Japan.\n\n\u2013 Tactical triumph \u2013\n\nLast week\u2019s stunning semi-final win over the tournament\u2019s hot favourites, reigning champions New Zealand, was a tactical triumph for Jones.\n\nHe was responsible for the V formation that saw England confront the haka in a bid to deny New Zealand a psychological edge before kick-off, as well as the often questioned selection of fullback Elliot Daly \u2014 whose run initiated the move that led to Manu Tuilagi\u2019s try in under two minutes.\n\nJones also chose as his captain Owen Farrell, once seen as a hothead but now a calming influence, and has skillfully switched between using the skipper and George Ford at fly-half in his \u201chorses for courses\u201d strategy during the knockout games.\n\nEngland defence coach John Mitchell, in charge of the All Blacks\u2019 team beaten by Jones\u2019s Wallabies in a 2003 World Cup semi-final, said there was far more to his boss than smart quips.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very good coach\u2026 He\u2019s always had a kind heart and has always been a guy that has wanted to learn and been willing to share as well.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Jones paid a typical tribute to his backroom staff by saying: \u201cThe assistant coaches have done an outstanding job.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the percentage of work, I should probably give my money back, but I probably won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIf England win the World Cup, however, Jones\u2019s employers at Twickenham will reckon he was worth every penny of his lucrative contract.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Eddie Jones\u2019s coaching career is set to come full circle when his England side face South Africa in Saturday\u2019s World Cup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/a97681_england-coach-eddie-jones-career-has-jones-england-maverick-eyes-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
