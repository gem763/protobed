And cold. Oh yes, and rain. As autumn slides into winter, mist turns to drizzle and sunset is replaced by mid-afternoon gloom, it can be hard to prepare for the months ahead. What to wear, how to warm up, even how to summon up the energy to get through the season. We asked a range of people whose outdoor work \u2013 from scaffolding to veterinary medicine \u2013 makes them experts in winter survival for their tips.\n\nThe greatest hurdle to winter living is state of mind. To a greater or lesser extent, all of us will find our mood affected by changes in weather, reduced daylight and a drop in temperature. The secret, says Graham Singer, a scaffolder working across Essex and London, is to give yourself milestones. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it since I was 15, so I know it\u2019s coming,\u201d he laughs. \u201cSometimes, you know as soon as you step out of the vehicle that everything\u2019s going to be soaked in a few minutes, so you resign yourself to that fact. Just keep in mind that in a few hours, you\u2019ll be back in the warm. Take it hour by hour \u2013 don\u2019t think about the whole day, but just the next job. Tomorrow can\u2019t be any worse.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Issa Robson: \u2018If you\u2019re in the right coat, you can do anything.\u2019 Photograph: Image provided by Issa Robson\n\nIssa Robson, a vet who works in Northumberland with large animals, takes it one step further, saying that, with the right protection in place, cold weather can make you feel pretty powerful. \u201cI don\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s raining,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve got all my kit on I actually feel pretty invincible. We lived on the west coast of Scotland so I learned that, if you\u2019re in the right coat, you can do anything.\u201d Cold, she says, can also be a question of attitude. \u201cAs long as your core is warm \u2013 your neck and chest \u2013 you can be pretty self-sustainable. Your fingers and feet might be cold, but you don\u2019t feel cold yourself.\u201d\n\nProfessional dog walker Sheila Mathieson has perhaps my favourite motto when it comes to working outside: you can only get wet once. \u201cOnce you\u2019re wet, you\u2019re wet \u2013 that\u2019s as bad as it\u2019s going to get. Nothing changes. That\u2019s your lot,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to look forward to getting back inside, jumping in the shower and getting dry. There\u2019s no point thinking about what it\u2019s going to be like out there. Just bite the bullet and get out there. I tell myself I have no choice; the dogs come first.\u201d\n\nOnce the temperature starts to drop, it is hard to underestimate the importance of movement. Tim Wright, a postman from Oxford, says that if you can keep moving for a quarter of an hour, you can overcome whatever the weather is doing around you. \u201cFor the first 10 or 15 minutes when you start, everything is frozen. Minus 12C is pretty extreme but when there\u2019s a hard frost, as long as you keep going for that first 15 minutes, you\u2019re fine. We have to wear fingerless gloves because we need to feel the letters, so the tips of our fingers are freezing. But, like I said, just keep moving. After that: bingo. The key is to keep your body pumping.\u201d\n\nWhen working as a lifeguard at the open-air pools on Hampstead Heath in London, I was advised to do as much exercise as I could during what little daylight we could find. That might mean a bike ride after your shift or, for office workers, a jog during your lunch break. Getting a hit of endorphins on a cold Tuesday in February can make all the difference to your immune system and your mental health.\n\nAs anyone who has ever had to play netball in January in borrowed school shorts and a T-shirt can tell you; clothing is important. Everybody I spoke to mentioned base layers. When I was a child, my father, a builder, would go off to work on a roof or digging foundations with a pair of my mum\u2019s tights under his work trousers. These days, says Singer, everybody from scaffolders to footballers should invest in a pair of thermal joggers and a couple of tops. \u201cStart with as many layers as you can. Then, as the day goes on \u2013 particularly if it\u2019s a nice, crisp winter day \u2013 you\u2019ll be taking one off every half-hour. Mind you, by the end of the day, you\u2019ll be putting them back on again.\u201d\n\nFor Robson, the right gear starts from the bottom. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of big pants,\u201d she says down the phone from her unheated kitchen. \u201cPants that don\u2019t cover your waist are a waste of time. If you want to stay warm, you can\u2019t have that bit of your back exposed.\u201d She also recommends thermal leggings and snow gear. \u201cWhen I was working for long stretches in minus 16C, I wore my snowboarding trousers. They\u2019re insulated and quite waterproof.\u201d But her favourite bit of kit is Smartwool mountaineering socks. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like having a carpet in your sock.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hollie Newton: \u2018In the depths of winter, I wear bright yellow Dunlop wellies.\u2019 Photograph: Image provided by Hollie Newton\n\nHollie Newton, a writer and fisherwoman living in Dorset, tells me that what you keep in your coat pockets is just as important as the coat itself. \u201cI always have a couple of those glove warmers in my pockets, as well as a vacuum flask with a really good hot chocolate.\u201d On her feet? \u201cOn the boat I tend to be barefoot \u2013 I really do love the cold \u2013 but in the real depths of winter, I wear bright yellow Dunlop wellies. I actually think if you try not to get wet, you\u2019ve lost the game before you even start.\u201d\n\nFor agricultural workers, cold frosty mornings will often coincide with fiddly outdoor jobs such as raising electric fences, filling drinking troughs or attending to livestock. \u201cI put on a barrier cream every night because once your hands get chapped, cracked or split \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re working with water \u2013 it becomes pretty unbearable,\u201d says Charles Bennett, an organic farmer who works near Tiddington in Warwickshire. \u201cCowmen have this lanolin-type stuff they put on the cows\u2019 udders that also protects their hands.\u201d\n\nFor Kelvin Markham, a builder and maintenance worker based in Oxfordshire, an upbeat disposition and physically active job are all you need. \u201cMy wife says I\u2019ve got rhino skin \u2013 all the rain, the cold, it just seems to slide off me. Dig in, throw yourself into it and you\u2019ll soon get hot. Even in mid-winter, when it\u2019s below freezing, you\u2019ll still see me in just a jumper after a couple of hours.\u201d\n\nWhile cold winter days can be draining, they are hopefully balanced out by the promise of the long warm days that will eventually come round again. \u201cSometimes, we\u2019ll joke to each other; what the hell are we doing here? Standing out here, in this weather, with our hands around freezing cold metal tubes, on scaffolding boards that are three inches thick with snow,\u201d says Singer. \u201cBut I do enjoy what I do. Even during the winter I wouldn\u2019t change it.\u201d", "description": "From a postman to a vet, we asked people who work outside in all weathers for tips for getting through the coldest, darkest months of the year \u2013 from big pants to barrier cream", "authors": ["Nell Frizzell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a274371febc680216ef4f36fc4518527fe07e8/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b70e09f3144a9ece1ca818f60ab49cd", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
