That trust has gone.\n\n'You are struggling to understand yourself, that someone you had so much respect, devotion and admiration for and still do, that you could intend to take their own life.'\n\nThe court heard Mrs May was seeking a divorce but as of March this year he was yet to agree.\n\nOf her account to the jury, Judge St.John-Stevens said she had been 'brave, fair and objective'.\n\nProsecutor Robin Griffiths said it was 'sheer good fortune rather than fine judgment' that May did not inflict a life-threatening injury to his wife.\n\nAlthough no bone, organ or vital blood vessels were penetrated, the blade was close to both a carotid artery and jugular vein.\n\nThe couple had been together for six years at the time of the murder bid at their home in Station Road.\n\nMrs May, who works in a school, told the court they enjoyed a good relationship and did not argue, other than 'to bicker over the washing up'.\n\n'We really loved each other,' she added.\n\nJust five days earlier, they had returned from South Korea where they had attended the wedding of Mrs May's brother.\n\nShe said the early morning knife attack was 'totally unexpected and a complete shock'.\n\nAt one stage Mrs May had even asked her husband if she would like his gift and quizzed him as to what it might be.\n\nGiving evidence for the prosecution, she told the court: 'I said to him 'This had better be a puppy' because we had talked about having one but he said 'It's not a puppy'.\n\nAt one stage Mrs May had even asked her husband if she would like his gift and quizzed him as to what it might be\n\nMay told his wife he had been fired from work the previous day after his boss had discovered he had used the company account to order personal goods from Amazon\n\n'Then it was just silent and I suddenly felt a pressure on my shoulder. I thought an animal had been thrown on me, something was clawing at me.\n\n'I was screaming 'I can't get it off, I can't get it off'. I must have reached up there at some point and realised there was nothing there, no animal.\n\n'But there was something rectangular in there. I thought it was a clamp or some kind of Halloween prop because I could feel blood trickling down.\n\n'I said 'This isn't real' and he said 'This is real'. He was calm.'\n\nThe court heard the couple had been to work on October 8 and shared a takeaway pizza while watching TV that evening.\n\nShe woke about 5am the next day to her husband coming into the bedroom, saying he had heard a noise downstairs.\n\nThey then became intimate before May told his wife he had a present for her, to close her eyes and to roll onto her back.\n\nHe then placed a tea towel over her eyes but left it untied.\n\nMrs May told the jury she believed her husband was kneeling next to her as his voice was very close.\n\nShe then recalled hearing a 'dinging' sound.\n\n'I didn't know what it was and I think I said 'Is it a plate?' because I like having different plates, and he said 'No, it's not a plate',' Mrs May said.\n\nHer phone then vibrated but she said May told her to ignore it.\n\nShe continued to lay on the bed, her eyes closed and covered, waiting for 'her present' for about 10 minutes, she added.\n\n'I think I kept asking him questions like 'Come on, what is it? Am I going to like this?' and he said 'Yes'.\n\n'Then I got fed up of waiting, got angry and rolled over. I kept my eyes shit but flung off the tea towel.\n\n'Shaun said 'I was going to do it then. I won't make you wait any longer. Come on, roll onto your back'.\n\n'He then pulled the duvet covers down, exposing the top part of my shoulders. My eyes were still shut.\n\n'The cloth had been put back on but I couldn't remember of I did that or he did.\n\n'Because I had just got a bit annoyed he said 'Come on Shaun, come on Shaun' and then he started counting down from 10 very slowly.\n\n'There would be a gap and the lower he got he went into decimals. I got annoyed because I was waiting.\n\n'He counted down two or three times but he never reached zero.'\n\nMrs May could not recall how or when the knife was removed.\n\nShe saw her husband standing with a knife in each hand, his arms by his sides and threatening to stab himself.\n\nBut despite her bleeding wound she screamed at him to put the knives down and asked why he had stabbed her.\n\nMay told his wife he had been fired from work the previous day after his boss had discovered he had used the company account to order personal goods from Amazon.\n\nAsked about his demeanour, Mrs May told the jury: 'He was upset about the fact he had lost his job and seemed more worried about that.\n\n'He said something like 'You are not going to be with me now. Look what I've done'. I was in complete shock and said 'It's fine. We will get through this'.'\n\nMay then drove his wife to the A&E department at the nearby Pembury Hospital where Mrs May, unaware how seriously she was injured, told staff she had tripped and fallen onto a knife.\n\nHowever, when her account was challenged by a doctor she broke down in tears.\n\nThe court heard May stayed with his wife throughout her wait in hospital until police arrived to arrest him.\n\n'They came and took Shaun. That's the last time I saw him,' she added.\n\nThe court heard May told an officer at the hospital of his work problems before adding: 'I picked up the knife and rather than injure myself I took it out on Laura.'\n\nWhile in custody he was seen by a psychiatric nurse and when asked about what had happened with his wife, May replied it was 'a sobering moment'.\n\nHe has since been diagnosed with a personality disorder brought on by the shame of losing his job.\n\nThe prosecutor told the jury May, who had admitted the less serious offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, had every intention to kill his wife when he stabbed her.\n\nMr Griffiths said the countdown and exhaltation 'Come on Shaun' meant he must have realised 'the enormity of what he was about to do'.\n\n'What else could he have possibly have had in mind at that moment other than to kill her,' added Mr Griffiths.\n\nA victim personal statement written in March this year by Mrs May, who was not in court for the sentencing hearing, was read out.\n\nShe spoke of how her dreams of spending the rest of her life with her husband and having children together had been shattered that day.\n\nMrs May described herself as 'merely existing' and often felt it would 'be better' if she had died that day.\n\nShe wrote: 'During the first couple of weeks after this happened all I could think about was how Shaun was.\n\n'He was threatening to end his life on the morning of the incident and I wanted to ensure he didn't cause harm to himself.\n\n'I told police I was concerned for his safety so they could make sure he was looked after. I wasn't thinking about me. My main concern was him.\n\n'However, the true impact of this has affected me deeply. My life is not the same, I'm not the same and I don't think I ever will be.\n\n'I was stabbed in my left shoulder/neck area and needed six stitches to the front of the wound and three to the exit wound.\n\n'The physical pain of this still affects me now. I have a stinging sensation daily, the scar itches and my neck gets stiff.\n\n'I am constantly reminded of the event by how my body physically feels. There is constant irritation and my doctor has said this may never subside. I cannot forget. The physical feeling doesn't go away.'\n\nMrs May said she could not work or return to her home for three months and intended to sell the property.\n\nShe continued: 'While I am now back at the house, the home I should say, I feel I am merely existing, going through the motions of not living.\n\n'Seeing the impact of this on others around me has been heartbreaking. I am very lucky to have a close group of friends and an amazing, supportive family.\n\n'But to see my father crying and speak to my brother who lives in South Korea and hear him crying have been some of the worst moments of my life.\n\nShaun May, 34, knifed his wife Laura May (pictured together) in the neck in a 'totally unexpected' attack, jurors were told\n\n'As a result I am trying to be strong, even though they tell me it's okay not to be, to ensure they are all right.\n\n'I worry about the impact this has had on them and want to protect them and so don't want to burden them with how I'm feeling.\n\n'I believe that when you get married it is for life but the seriousness and completely unpredictable nature of the incident mean I cannot trust Shaun entirely anymore.\n\n'As a result I'm seeking a divorce, something as yet Shaun has not agreed to.\n\n'I cannot remain married to him. It doesn't mean all the feelings I have for him are gone. We did have six years together. But I cannot guarantee my safety with him.\n\n'This event has completely changed my life. I feel my life has stopped. We were meant to spend the rest of our lives together. We were going to have children together.\n\n'At this moment in time I cannot see how I will ever get those things in my life.\n\n'Most of my friends are on that journey and while I am happy for them I cannot feel anything but immense sadness for the life I have lost.\n\n'I'm often told by friends and family that I'm so brave or doing so well. This can't be further from the truth.\n\n'I do a very good job of appearing strong but in reality I lack any real feelings. I feel empty. I am unsure if I will ever feel true happiness or love ever again.\n\n'I often think it would have been better if I were killed. It would be so much easier not to be here to face people, to see the pity and sorrow in their eyes.\n\n'This is quickly followed by an immense amount of guilt. I shouldn't feel like that but I can't help it.'", "description": "Husband Shaun May from Tunbridge Wells, Kent who attempted to murder his wife Laura May by stabbing her after telling her he had a 'present' for her was jailed for 13-and-a-half years on Friday.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/17/19892796-0-image-a-3_1571414826441.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
