If a fund is not disclosing information about climate risk, an investor may be right to be suspicious that not much is being done to manage the risk.\u201d\n\nSustainable or responsible investing identifies environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) and/or ethical issues across a portfolio. Of the 120 investment managers in Australia assessed by RIAA, about one-quarter are engaging companies about ESG by talking to company owners and executives about their strategies, or taking shareholder action at annual general meetings.\n\nAustralian Ethical\u2019s Palmer says it has used a shareholder resolution to lobby insurance giant QBE about underwriting fossil fuel companies. It has also used nominal holdings in other companies to support similar actions against listed companies by other activist shareholders.\n\nRIAA lists 10 broad investment strategies used by its members, ranging from education, green property and renewable energy to sustainable transport and water.\n\n\u201cNegative screening\u201d is also popular, with exclusions focusing on fossil fuels, human rights, controversial weapons and tobacco.\n\nThe categories are being extended or developed as managers improve their analysis of environmental, financial and social data.\n\nSome investors fear that a responsible investment strategy locks them out of potential growth from large conglomerates whose product range or production processes could breach responsible criteria, such as a retailer selling tobacco or a steel company\u2019s production being used by the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are shades of grey,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cSometimes that is used as an excuse for being too hard to draw a line. But that does not mean there is not a line there.\u201d\n\nFor example, many top-performing bluechips might have retailers that sell cigarettes, which are likely to be on most ethical investors\u2019 hit list. Palmer says Australian Ethical tolerates a ceiling of less than 1 per cent of revenues from tobacco. It bans any investment in cigarette production.\n\nMasja Zandbergen, head of sustainability integration at global ESG specialist Robeco, which has more than $300 billion under management, says many younger investors are increasingly concerned about climate change and want to reflect this in their choice of financial provider and investment portfolio.\n\nSome 95 per cent of Millennials are interested in sustainable investing, up from 86 per cent in 2017, a Morgan Stanley report says.\n\n\u201cIt has entered the mainstream,\u201d the report concludes. \"It also signals opportunities for investment professionals as sustainable investing matures and grows more sophisticated.\u201d\n\nThe findings are based on 800 investors with minimum investable assets of $100,000. More than 65 per cent complained there were not enough financial products targeting sustainable strategies for their portfolios.\n\n\u201cThings are happening and they are happening fast on sustainable investing. Because climate change is a big focus point, many asset owners are measuring and setting targets on green house gas emissions and/or investing in solutions companies,\" Zandbergen says.\n\n\"The [benchmark] UN Sustainable Development Goals also have had a big influence and are used by the market to define sustainability. It is not only about climate, but how to feed the world, keep people healthy and embrace equality and diversity.\u201d\n\nAccording to the RIAA, investors are not sacrificing performance by choosing responsible funds, which outperform mainstream funds over most asset classes and terms.\n\nFor example, over the last five years average Australian share funds with responsible investing mandates have returned about 6.43 per cent, compared to 4.42 per cent for Australian funds without an ESG mandate and 5.6 per cent from the S &P/ASX 300.\n\nGlobal responsible funds have returned about 9.5 per cent over the same period, compared to around 8.4 per cent from the Morningstar general global equity fund and 9.8 per cent from the MSCI world index.", "description": "With investors becoming more strident about how they want their retirement portfolio invested, a test case against REST Super has many watching this space.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d6eb218e7ff46962b0b4770fe5069214eb573b4c", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
