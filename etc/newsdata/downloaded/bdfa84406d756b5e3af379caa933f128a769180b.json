Its biggest challenge is to build out infrastructure in a territory seen as a key to unlocking more exports to fast-growing markets such as China, Japan, and India.\n\nThe biggest names at the three-day Eastern Economic Forum \u2013 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2013 left without any headline deals, save a $1 billion credit line from India for developing the Far East. Mr. Abe left without signing any major agreements.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t for want of trying. Mr. Putin made the case clear that Russia and the Far East, which suffers from lack of transport and power infrastructure and endemic corruption, is hungry for business and investment.\n\n\u201cThere is not a single sector that could be closed for our foreign partners,\u201d said Mr. Putin speaking at the forum. \u201cQuite the opposite, we\u2019re interested in attracting it, we strive for it.\u201d\n\nThe development of the Far East, which is slightly smaller than China in territory but with a population of less than 7 million, represents not only a chance to piggyback on Asian growth, but an attempt to bring the region closer under Moscow\u2019s control. Two provinces in the region launched a protest vote last year against incumbent pro-Kremlin governors, ousting them in elections.\n\nIn what appeared to be a protracted sales pitch, Mr. Putin told the forum that since 2015 \u2013 the first year the gathering was held \u2013 nearly $1 billion has been invested in the region, creating 39,000 jobs. He also touted opportunities to invest in some of Russia\u2019s biggest infrastructure plans, including the $600 million Zvezda port project that will focus on exports to East and South Asia, as well as Vostochny Cosmodrome, a new site for Russian state and civilian space launches.\n\nMessrs. Modi and Abe came to Vladivostok in the hopes of building inroads with Mr. Putin and leading Russia away from China, which has seen its relations with Moscow blossom with booming trade and a planned new military agreement. Stronger ties with Russia would help give India and Japan leverage over China. For Russia, it would also help Moscow diversify its Asian partners at a time when it fears its chronic economic problems will relegate it to the role of China\u2019s junior partner.\n\n\u201cRussia needs a diversity of strategic partners in the region to maintain its strategic autonomy going forward,\u201d said Thomas Graham, a former U.S. diplomat and managing director of Kissinger Associates.\n\nThe forum itself brought only a meager showing of regional deals and vague agreements. A delegation of officials and businessmen from five Indian states toured the region ahead of the forum, looking for opportunities in diamond and coal mining as well as oil and gas. The trip ended with a series of memorandums of understanding, but few, if any, publicized contracts.\n\nTo make up for the lack of foreign investment, the Russian government has promised to spend nearly $10 billion to expand the region\u2019s roads and railroads and ease transport in the region where bottlenecks often occur at the territory\u2019s biggest ports. But sluggish Russian economic growth has caused the state to tighten its belt, meaning the money isn\u2019t coming in as fast as planned.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the government doesn\u2019t have any money and nobody as of right now is really investing in the region,\u201d said Artyom Lukin, an expert on the Far East at the Far East Federal University, which was the site of the forum. \u201cThey can\u2019t see making profits here.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, a lack of jobs and high prices for consumer goods is triggering a steady of exodus of people, usually to Moscow, St. Petersburg or Novosibirsk, Russia\u2019s three biggest cities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great there\u2019s a forum, agreements have been signed. But what do we see of it?\u201d asked Alexander Shkirsky, an unemployed resident of the city. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\nWrite to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com", "description": "The Russian president pitched for major investments from Japan and India at Vladivostok meeting but failed to seal any landmark deals.", "authors": ["Thomas Grove", "Thomas.Grove Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104576/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
