It seems like most people rely on their Facebook or Twitter feeds for the latest headlines, but I\u2019m sceptical of this method. Not only do you have to contend with fake news and shady ads pretending to be headlines, but there\u2019s also a glut of research telling us spending too much time on social media is bad for us physically and mentally.\n\nOne of the best tools for curbing my social media use has been switching to a news aggregator instead of scrolling through my social feed to see what\u2019s going on. But even if you\u2019re not interested in cutting down on your social media intake, news aggregator apps are a helpful way to consolidate the various bits of online content you consume each day into a single location.\n\nMost of these apps include handy tools that let you organise your subscriptions, save articles to be read later, help you find new content based on keywords or topics, and even let you import and export between other apps or services.\n\nWe\u2019ve covered news aggregators in the past, but it\u2019s been a long time since we updated our list, and we want to hear your suggestions.\n\nFor me, the RSS app Feedly has been my go-to news aggregator for years now. Its chronological feed, flexible search and organisation tools, and cross-platform syncing are all excellent, and it helped me wean off Twitter for news \u2014 and just about everything else.\n\nSince it\u2019s an RSS reader, Feedly can even be used to track YouTube and podcast subscriptions, blogs, and even newsletters in some cases. Oh, and both the web and mobile versions have built-in dark themes.\n\nThere are other options besides Feedly, of course; Some are news-focused services like News360 or even Apple News or Google News, and others are more niche like the tech news-focused app, Panda. But that\u2019s just scratching the surface.\n\nThere are tons of news aggregation and RSS reader apps available in the Google Play and Apple App stores, plus tons of standalone websites.\n\nSo, to those of you who use a news aggregator, what\u2019s your favourite?", "description": "How do you  find and read your news?
