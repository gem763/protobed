It also raises the prospect that the EU need to hold another Brexit summit before the end of the month.\n\n\u201cThe 31st of October is still a few weeks away and there is a possibility of another summit before that if we need one,\u201d Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in Dublin.\n\nThe British government, meanwhile, insisted the U.K. would still leave the EU on Oct. 31 \u2014 but also promised to obey Parliament\u2019s order that it must seek a delay to Britain\u2019s Brexit departure date if no deal is in place by Saturday.\n\n\u201cI can confirm, as the prime minister has repeatedly set out, that \u2026 the government will comply with the law,\u201d Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told British lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nThe EU already struck a Brexit divorce deal with former British Prime Minister Theresa May, but that was rejected three times by British lawmakers. With that experience in mind, EU leaders are seeking reassurances from Johnson during this week\u2019s summit that he has the political weight to push any new deal through the House of Commons.\n\nThe Brexit talks plodded ahead Wednesday, further delaying preparations for the EU summit. Since the weekend, negotiators at the EU\u2019s glass-and-steel headquarters in Brussels have been locked into long sessions on how to deal with detailed customs, VAT and regulatory issues under British proposals to eliminate border checks between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\n\u201cTalks have been constructive but there still remains a number of significant issues to resolve,\u201d EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said after being briefed by EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nBoth sides were hoping that after more than three years of false starts and sudden reversals, a clean divorce deal for Britain leaving the bloc might be sketched out within the coming hours.\n\nJohnson is eager to strike a deal at Thursday\u2019s summit that will let the U.K. leave the bloc in good order on Oct. 31, fulfilling his promise to get Brexit done, come what may.\n\nU.K. lawmakers, however, are determined to push for another Brexit delay rather than risk a chaotic no-deal Brexit that economists say could hurt the economies of both the U.K. and the E.U.\n\nBut both sides say gaps remain over plans for keeping goods and people flowing freely across the Irish border, the thorniest issue in the talks.\n\nAn open border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland underpins both the local economy and the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant violence in Northern Ireland. But once Britain exits, that border will turn into an external EU frontier that the bloc wants to keep secure.\n\nThe big question is how far Johnson\u2019s government is prepared to budge on its insistence that the U.K., including Northern Ireland, must leave the EU\u2019s customs union \u2014 something that would require checks on goods passing between the U.K. and the EU.\n\nIreland and other EU members say any checks on the Irish border are unacceptable.\n\nThe alternative is to have checks in the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland. But Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, the party that props up Johnson\u2019s minority Conservative government, strongly opposes any measures that could loosen the bonds between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nAnd even if there is a Brexit deal, it must be passed by both EU lawmakers and Britain\u2019s Parliament.\n\nPro-Brexit Conservative British lawmaker David Davis says success in passing a Brexit deal rests on the stance of the DUP.\n\n\u201cIf the DUP says \u2018This is intolerable to us\u2019 that will be quite important,\u201d he said.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said the party had not yet consented to a deal. She tweeted: \u201cDiscussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLawless reported from London.
