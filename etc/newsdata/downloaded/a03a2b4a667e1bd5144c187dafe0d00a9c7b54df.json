Photo: Nina Goodheart\n\nIt\u2019s bad luck for the Roundabout that its new musical Scotland, PA\u2014which has been in commissioning cycle for years\u2014has had to hit the scene just now. The programming logic might have linked its source material (a 2001 movie that loosely adapted Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth) to a Halloweeny mood, and so here it is in October. But the show\u2019s untimely. While it\u2019s already a weak musical, it suffers particularly in comparison to the revival of Little Shop of Horrors that just opened across town. There\u2019s too much overlap to ignore: Book writer Michael Mitnick and composer/lyricist Adam Gwon have written a black-comic musical based on a film, set about 20 years in the writers\u2019 past, among working stiffs who start killing after supernatural voices give the command. It\u2019s a classic structure! There\u2019s no harm in borrowing it! But with the parallels so close, it\u2019s almost impossible not to see where Scotland \u2026 detoured.\n\nMitnick and Gwon follow Billy Morrissette\u2019s movie in turning Shakespeare\u2019s foggy moors into the Pennsylvania hinterlands in the \u201970s: Instead of kingship, our antihero just wants supremacy in the Keystone State\u2019s burger wars. Spurred on by a trio of witchy stoners (Alysha Umphress, Wonu Ogunfowora, and Kaleb Wells) and his wife Pat (Taylor Iman Jones), Mac (Ryan McCartan) permanently deposes his boss, the creepy diner-owner Duncan (Jeb Brown). Murder follows on murder, as they do, but despite a pesky homicide detective named McDuff (Megan Lawrence), Mac revamps the restaurant to become MacBeth\u2019s, inventing a burger called the Big Mac and creating a drive-through window. Shakespeare\u2019s hellhound turns out to have a nose for business: Flying in the face of actual history, his updated self invents the Golden Arches and does great business, at least until fate catches up to him.\n\nLittle Shop is Faust with flowers; Scotland, PA is Macbeth with McDonald\u2019s. But where the former used its setting in the early \u201960s to exploit musical styles like doo-wop and girl-group close harmony, Gwon sets every song in a near-identical, rock-adjacent mode that plays no games with the \u201970s\u2014no funk, no psychedelia, no disco. Characters do sometimes dress for disco (at his zenith, Mac wears a white suit out of Saturday Night Fever); Umphress\u2014who makes her own sly-eyed comic hay wherever she can\u2014would clearly love to bust out with a bit of repurposed Joni Mitchell. But Gwon isn\u2019t interested in pastiche, and he rarely varies his sound. The tunes are also notably slow, with their pace creating some strange challenges. During the finale \u201cEverybody\u2019s Hungry,\u201d the thunk-thunk-thunk of the downbeat is so sluggish it actually makes dancing difficult. The company starts at the back of the stage and has to advance like a squad of zombies\u2014plod plod plod\u2014just to match the tempo.\n\nTwo songs stand out from the rest. In the first act, Mac\u2019s loser best-bud Banko (Jay Armstrong Johnson), decides to throw a party. He\u2019s a noodle of the first rank, a dim bulb that\u2019s never been switched on. Johnson plays him as bombed out of his mind, reeling through scenes and ambling doggishly away whenever his friends swat at him. But in \u201cKick-Ass Party\u201d he gets to own the stage, capering around in a Hugh Hefner bathrobe and hoping for the best. In the second act, Gwon\u2019s other charm song also works: Duncan\u2019s son Malcolm (Will Meyers) admits to a love for football that sways sweetly into a ballad about the locker room. Gwon doesn\u2019t seem to have as many ideas for his leads, so their lyrics just repeat ideas about \u201cheaven,\u201d and \u201cparadise\u201d as they pledge their rather boring love for each other. Gwon\u2019s heart is clearly with the odd boys out\u2014his wit is roused, his lyrics sharpen, and you sense the scope of what he\u2019ll someday do.\n\nMorrissette\u2019s movie got much of its humor out of its textures. The visuals of the \u201970s were supposed to be part of the fun: People love to giggle at a bell-bottom, and, crucially, the wild card Christopher Walken played McDuff, painting the whole picture with his dark zaniness. Here, neither Mitnick nor director Lonny Price has the same excitement about either detail or weirdness\u2014it\u2019s bizarre that in a comedy, there are so few decent jokes. There\u2019s too little spirit of invention or danger; even the low-hanging humor seems to have gone unpicked. (No one wanted to get a damn\u00e9d ketchup spot out of their uniform?) Despite the efforts of all involved, Scotland, PA seems sleepy and a little sloppy. I will say, though, that it\u2019s pretty good advertising. After a solid decade of avoiding the McDonald\u2019s on Sixth Avenue, I went there after the show. I was halfway through my Happy Meal before I realized what the musical had made me do. Was that \u2026 a French fry which I saw before me?\n\nScotland, PA is at the Roundabout\u2019s Laura Pels Theatre through December 8.", "description": "Theater Review: \u2018Scotland, PA,\u2019 the New Musical Based on Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth at the Roundabout Theatre Company", "authors": ["Helen Shaw"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/Scotland-PA-23.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
