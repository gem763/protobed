However, there was no immediate confirmation of this from Italy.\n\n\"We are relieved, and appreciate that France, Germany, and Italy have finally found a solution for relocation of all 104 survivors on board Ocean Viking, and the 90 people on board Alan Kurdi,\" Michael Fark, the MSF head of mission for Libya and the Mediterranean, said on Tuesday.\n\n\"After days stranded at sea, and enduring horrific conditions in Libya and along their journey, finally they will be taken to safety.\n\n\"It is unacceptable to strand people at sea, waiting days and weeks while European states debate whether and how to fulfil their humanitarian and legal obligations. It's disappointing that only three states were part of this solution,\" he added, calling all European countries to \"live up to their principles\".\n\nUPDATE After 11 days stranded at sea, it was just announced that France, Germany & Italy found an agreement for the relocation of 104 people on #OceanViking & 90 people on #AlanKurdi.\n\n\n\nPozzallo, Italy, was just assigned as a Place of Safety to the #OceanViking for disembarkation. pic.twitter.com/2GlSvg05DE \u2014 SOS MEDITERRANEE (@SOSMedIntl) October 29, 2019\n\nMatteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party who was Italy's interior minister for 14 months up until August, had closed Italian ports to charity ships, leaving boats stranded in the Mediterranean for many days awaiting authorisation to dock.\n\nSalvini denounced Tuesday's decision to let the Ocean Viking come to port.\n\n\"Once again the Italian government has dropped its trousers. Once again it is doing a favour to an NGO ... which encourages human traffickers to ply their trade,\" he said.\n\nThe League's decision to quit the coalition opened the door for the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) to enter government with the populist Five Star Movement.\n\nThe centre-left PD has pushed for a more moderate immigration policy and has looked to Europe for assistance in dealing with the issue.", "description": "Government gives permission to Ocean Viking to disembark stranded passengers it picked off Libya's coat on October 18.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/50c2c9b62f8e457ba6bc4983fbf72f29_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
