Sponsored Content Why harm reduction and product safety standards go hand in hand\n\nAround the world, millions of smokers are turning to vaping and other potentially reduced-risk alternatives to smoking. In this dynamic, fast-evolving space, new technologies and products frequently arrive on the market. Arguably, this provides a challenge for local regulators and government authorities when it comes to ensuring that existing mandated quality and safety standards are enforced.\n\nFrom simple to complex\n\nThe worldwide supply chain for e-cigarettes and other alternatives to smoking is complex and includes hundreds of thousands of suppliers, manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retailers. Although some manufacturers would have the experience and resources to develop proprietary technology and make the necessary investments in product quality and safety, this may not be true for all participants on the market.\n\nConsumer demand is becoming increasingly fragmented as the way people consume nicotine shifts from one basic agricultural product to the myriad of vaping devices now available. The European Union, for example, now counts an estimated six-million-plus vapers, who can choose from hundreds of different systems and products. With so much variety, how can consumers wanting to switch from smoking to vaping be sure that their chosen vaping device and liquid are of good quality?\n\nSetting the standard\n\nIn Europe, the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) introduced safety and quality requirements that member states must ensure that manufacturers comply with. The requirements include: a maximum nicotine concentration for e-liquids; and a volume limit for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers. Member states also need to make certain that liquid ingredients are of \u201chigh purity\u201d and that e-cigarettes and refill bottles are child resistant, tamper evident and that products can be refilled without leaking, to protect consumers. In addition, the TPD also requires that e-cigarettes and refill containers comply with all other relevant EU legislation, for example, electronics and battery safety regulations.\n\nUniversal product quality and safety standards are absolutely essential if consumers are going to have confidence in the products\n\nBuilding on the foundation provided by the TPD, a technical committee was set up under the auspices of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) to enable industry, regulators, consumers and other relevant stakeholders to work together to create a more detailed and standardized set of safety and quality requirements related to emissions, ingredients, electrical safety, and overall product quality and safety standards.\n\nHowever, the important work of organizations such as CEN, and its global counterpart, ISO, which facilitate the process of generating standards, can take considerable time. Both rely on the voluntary participation of a wide range of affected stakeholders, from public health bodies to analytical laboratories, consumer organizations and industry, among many. Standards are eventually reached by diverse working group experts, through consensus.\n\nTo date, two CEN documents and one ISO document providing guidance for e-cigarettes have been adopted, focusing on device safety standards and which emissions to measure. Several more are underway, for example, on manufacturing and ingredient requirements, emissions and e-liquid measurement methods, and consumer information and labelling.\n\nMeanwhile, some member states have provided further clarity in terms of their interpretation of some of the TPD requirements. The U.K. regulator, for example, has provided further detailed guidance on the application of the TPD safety standards and quality requirements regarding vaping products. The Danish Safety and Technology Authority has provided its interpretation of the TPD\u2019s child resistance requirements. While these are positive developments, it seems in the interest of consumers and regulators alike that the furthering and clarification of mandated technical regulation, such as quality standards, should be harmonized across Europe rather than conducted in an isolated manner.\n\nIt is not just the pace at which standards are being developed around e-cigarettes that poses a challenge. Not all products on the European market today seem to meet the current standards, which could be linked to enforcement. The enforcement procedures are different in each member state, as are the compositions of the competent enforcement bodies, and their ability to mobilize the required resources for enforcement.\n\nIn the long run, universal product quality standards are essential if consumers are going to have confidence in the products so that e-cigarettes will deliver on their potential to be a game changer for public health, a view which is increasingly held by independent experts. While these universal standards might be a long way off, both CEN and ISO are working continuously to support standards in various areas related to e-cigarettes, which eventually the EU regulators could leverage to underpin future harmonized regulation. It would then be down to the individual member states to prioritize resourcing the enforcement of these standards.\n\nDisclaimer: This content is aimed at informing policymakers and other stakeholders on scientific, regulatory and legal aspects concerning the market for nicotine products and is in no way intended to promote the use of any products towards consumers.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "", "authors": ["Dr. Christopher Proctor", "Group Head Of Prrp Science", "British American Tobacco", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo_Politico_OPED2-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
