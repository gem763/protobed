Although the tone in this short clip from NBC\u2019s Today sounds more like a scolding fact-check, it also acknowledges that Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to piggyback on his dad\u2019s state visit to China to work on his own business deal seems a little odd in retrospect. Reporter Josh Lederman cuts back across the grain to note that Hunter\u2019s presence on the VP\u2019s Air Force Two flight didn\u2019t seem unusual, but that reporters didn\u2019t know he was negotiating with bankers in China for his own profit either:\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s business deals during his father\u2019s time as vice president are drawing new scrutiny \u2013 a 2013 trip to China is getting new attention because then-Vice President Biden brought Hunter on the official visit, @halliejackson reports. pic.twitter.com/tDPsWr1hRd \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 2, 2019\n\nWhile Donald Trump\u2019s specific claims about the amounts and dates appear to be false, there\u2019s no avoiding the conclusion that Hunter Biden used Joe Biden\u2019s official trip to China for his personal enrichment. Worse yet, as Lederman reports separately today, it also leaves the distinct impression that Joe Biden was a participant in his son\u2019s efforts to cash in on his father\u2019s office, even if no smoking gun has yet emerged:\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t known then was that as he accompanied his father to China, Hunter Biden was forming a Chinese private equity fund that associates said at the time was planning to raise big money, including from China. Hunter Biden has acknowledged meeting with Jonathan Li, a Chinese banker and his partner in the fund during the trip, although his spokesman says it was a social visit. The Chinese business license that brought the new fund into existence was issued by Shanghai authorities 10 days after the trip, with Hunter Biden a member of the board. \u2026 In August, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, raised concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s meeting with Li in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that warned of Hunter Biden\u2019s \u201chistory of investing in and collaborating with Chinese companies.\u201d Grassley\u2019s letter also cited media reports saying Hunter Biden had arranged for Li, his business partner, to shake hands with the vice president while in Beijing. Also involved in the fund is Devon Archer, a past adviser to former Secretary of State John Kerry, who also partnered with Hunter Biden on his work in Ukraine and a U.S. investment firm.\n\nLederman\u2019s account also rejects Trump\u2019s specific allegations about Hunter Biden, but takes a more cautious approach to the Biden story otherwise. Had the younger Biden gone on his own to China and conducted his business separately, it might not have raised any questions. Using Air Force Two to accompany his father at the same time Hunter was pitching Chinese investors \u2014 who in China have to have connections to the regime to survive \u2014 looks bad. And note Lederman\u2019s mention of Ukraine and the Kerrys as well, an aspect of this case that the New York Times\u2019 Ken Vogel first broached in May.\n\nThe Hunter Biden angle may not be enough to get Trump off the hook for twisting arms in Ukraine. But the arm-twisting in Ukraine certainly won\u2019t be enough to keep people from asking what Hunter Biden\u2019s true business model was during his father\u2019s vice-presidency either, especially not with the $50K/month gig on a corrupt Ukrainian corporate board in an area where Hunter had no expertise whatsoever, and where his father seemed awfully eager to intervene.\n\nUpdate: Be sure to read Jim Geraghty\u2019s follow-up to his massive essay on Hunter Biden from Monday. He parries the pushback on scrutiny of the Bidens as concisely as I\u2019ve seen it done:\n\n\u201cHunter Biden isn\u2019t running for president, Joe Biden is!\u201d Er, yes, and the whole point is that if Hunter Biden wasn\u2019t the son of Joe Biden, then he would not have been hired at such a lucrative rate by MBNA, various universities and hospitals, Chinese institutional investors, Chinese private-equity fund Bohai Capital, Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, Burisma Holdings, and other institutions. The issue is not merely that Hunter worked for shady people and institutions, it\u2019s that he worked for shady people and institutions who wanted to influence or profit from changes to U.S. policy. \u201cHunter Biden joining Burisma\u2019s board was a bad decision, but it wasn\u2019t illegal.\u201d No, but as the timeline illustrates, Hunter Biden\u2019s career was built on one situation after another that was technically legal but still looked bad. Sure, he never officially lobbied his father, but his partners did, and he lobbied all his dad\u2019s colleagues. Sure, Joe Biden was unlikely to ever antagonize MBNA, one of the biggest employers in his state, but hiring Hunter ensured another solid connection. (In 1998, an MBNA executive named John Cochran bought Joe Biden\u2019s house for full price, with some speculating that he overpaid, a sort of backdoor payment to the then-senator. Our old friend Byron York had that story.) If you\u2019re a Chinese institutional investor, you\u2019ve got every investment fund in the United States begging for a meeting. Are we supposed to believe that it was coincidental that they chose to meet with the one that employed the vice president\u2019s son? When the chairman of Burisma declared while announcing Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment to the board, \u201cthis is totally based on merit,\u201d who was he trying to convince? You\u2019ll notice that when Joe Biden is discussing allegations of corruption about someone else, his general attitude is that the legal technicalities matter little. \u201cCome on, man! Give me a break! Malarkey!\u201d When the questions are about Hunter Biden, his campaign hides behind the generic statement, \u201cThe Obama-Biden administration created and upheld the strongest ethics policy of any presidency in American history.\u201d Surely, there couldn\u2019t be a flaw, loophole, or oversight in the Obama administration ethics policy, right?\n\nRead it all, and then bookmark it, because it makes for a handy reference.", "description": "\"Collaborating\"?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/today-bidens.png"}
