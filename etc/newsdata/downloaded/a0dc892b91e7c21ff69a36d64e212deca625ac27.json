A surprise music video from said starlet for a completely different song, that\u2019s what! On Wednesday, Selena Gomez dropped her first single, \u201cLose You To Love Me,\u201d from her upcoming third album, sending spark waves through the nation as everyone combed through her lyrics to learn how she\u2019s been these past few years. If anyone was worried that Selena might be struggling with the Bieber-Baldwin of it all, they shouldn\u2019t be, because according to the video Gomez dropped early on Thursday for her song \u201cLook At Her Now\u201d she\u2019s doing just fine.\n\nThe video is simple in its scope and powerful in its effect: Selina in a white room, surrounded by female dancers, singing about how far she\u2019s come. No men, no other locations, just an incredibly famous girl singing in the third person about getting over her incredibly famous ex-boyfriend, probably. It seems Selena has entered a new phase of her life. She\u2019s now Selena 2.0: a girl who \u201ctook a few years to soak up the tears\u201d but is officially \u201con her way up from the way down\u201d and is ready to sing and dance with the best of them. You go, Selena 2.0!", "description": "Selena Gomez dropped the music video for her new single \u2018Look At Her Now\u2019 off of her upcoming third studio album.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/24-Selena-Gomez.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
