He\u2019s stepped up so much and has been the most amazing dad, playing all the games with the kids and things like that.\u2019\n\nThe social media queen threw the vow renewal with their family in attendance, and wore a white dress for the occasion.\n\nHowever, the actual ceremony was not filmed for the show, with Kim explaining: \u2018I think it\u2019s so special that all four of our kids are here. It\u2019ll just be really sweet, and I\u2019m excited that everyone is coming over.\n\n\u2018We wanted to keep it really personal and it\u2019s private for us.\u2019\n\nKim did reveal the first line of her vows, though, reading: \u2018You are my husband. You are my best friend. My biggest believer and my one true love.\u2019\n\nN\u2019aww.\n\nKimye\u2019s vow renewal came after the birth of their son Psalm, who was born via surrogate on 10 May.\n\nDiscussing his birth, Kim \u2013 who is also mum to North, six, Saint, three, and one-year-old Chicago \u2013 insisted that four is enough when it comes to kids.\n\nShe said: \u2018Our surrogate is so amazing. She had the easiest delivery. She pushed literally maybe one time. Kourtney and Kanye were in the room with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I feel so complete. I really do feel like four is the perfect number for me. I feel so full in the best way, but I\u2019m done.\u2019\n\nAnd on the show, the lawyer-in-training revealed that Psalm could have been called Ye, after his daddy.\n\n\u2018His name was going to Ye, but Kanye didn\u2019t like Ye because Ye it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\n\u2018We looked up every name in the bible that had Ye in the beginning, and the only name was Yehezkel, and Kylie called at the last second and was like, \u201cno!\u201dPslam and Saint sound good together.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
