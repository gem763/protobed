Jordan Henderson equalised and Mohamed Salah won the game from the penalty spot with 15 minutes to go.\n\nPulisic makes up for lost time\n\nWhen Frank Lampard was asked about Christian Pulisic\u2019s lack of playing time earlier this season, the usually affable Chelsea manager\u2019s terse reply told its own story.\n\nWhile Lampard was polite about Pulisic\u2019s situation \u2014 he lacked his teammates\u2019 fitness levels after a truncated pre-season \u2014 he made it clear the United States winger would only play when he felt the time was right.\n\nPulisic was desperate to kick-start his Chelsea career following his move from Borussia Dortmund and, finally given his first league start since August, Pulisic made up for lost time with an impressive hat-trick in Chelsea\u2019s 4-2 win at Burnley.\n\nAttacking with pace and purpose, Pulisic showed he is ready to contribute to Lampard\u2019s emerging young side with goals with his right foot, left foot and head.\n\n\u201cThe goals were amazing. It\u2019s tough to say which was my favourite,\u201d Pulisic said.\n\nThe so-called perfect hat-trick should keep him in Lampard\u2019s team for a while to come.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Liverpool showed they have steel as well as style after battling back from conceding an early goal against Tottenham while Manchester", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/ea4ca7_mohamed-salah-celebrates-scoring-penalty-in-liverpool-win-tottenham-we-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
