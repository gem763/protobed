(AP) - Miami Dolphins defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick got his wish and was traded Monday night to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a first-round draft pick in 2020, two people familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nThe people confirmed the deal to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn\u2019t announced it. The teams will also swap late-round picks.\n\nFitzpatrick was displeased about his role with the Dolphins. He requested and received permission to seek a trade before playing free safety for Miami in Sunday\u2019s 43-0 loss to New England, when he had six tackles and a fumble recovery.\n\nThe rebuilding Dolphins (0-2), who have purged their roster to accumulate draft picks, now have three first-round choices in 2020. While putting a priority on the future, they\u2019ve been outscored 102-10 in their first two games.\n\nThe Steelers (0-2) can use Fitzpatrick\u2019s help. In two games they\u2019ve allowed 640 yards through the air and six touchdown passes. They\u2019re also reeling from the loss of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to an elbow injury.\n\nFitzpatrick was the 11th overall pick in the 2018 draft, but quickly became unhappy after Brian Flores took over as Miami\u2019s coach this year.\n\nWhen the Dolphins put Fitzpatrick at strong safety during training camp, his mother, Melissa, complained on Twitter that he was being asked to play out of position. He said she wasn\u2019t wrong.\n\nThe situation came to a head following a season-opening 59-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, when Fitzpatrick struggled and the Dolphins tied a team record by allowing six touchdown passes in the most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\nFitzpatrick divided his time among safety, linebacker and nickel cornerback in the opener. Last year as a rookie under coach Adam Gase, the 202-pound Fitzpatrick played mostly nickel cornerback but also boundary corner and both safety spots.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Miami Dolphins defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick got his wish and was traded Monday night to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a first-round draft pick in 2020, two people familiar with the negotiations said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/steelers_dolphins_trade_football_43383_c0-131-3135-1958_s1770x1032.jpg?dd01eac732ca84458c657eec22e66a361c05c625", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
