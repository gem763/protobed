The Trump administration in June trotted out its replacement for Obama\u2019s signature climate change regulation, which eliminates state-specific carbon dioxide emissions reductions for a narrower plan enabling states to upgrade the efficiency of power plants to drive carbon dioxide reductions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSenate Democrats will also force votes on rolling back the administration\u2019s offering of skimpier health care plans that do not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act. They will also hit back at regulations preventing workarounds to part of the 2017 tax cut law, H.R. 1 (115), which put a $10,000 ceiling on the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes, a limit that\u2019s largely impacted taxpayers in New York, New Jersey and California along with a few other states.\n\nThe effort is part of Schumer\u2019s efforts to hit Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for shirking legislation passed by the Democratic House on guns, climate change, health care and other topics.\n\n\u201cSenator McConnell and Senate Republicans have shunned vital proposals to improve American\u2019s lives,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cSenate Democrats will not sit around and wait for Senator McConnell to finally wake up and take action.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic minority is able to force the regulatory votes under the Congressional Review Act, which allows regulations to be overturned by a simple majority. McConnell successfully rolled back some of Obama\u2019s regulations at the start of 2017, though Schumer will need at least four GOP defections to chip away at Trump\u2019s regulations, a difficult task.\n\nThe votes are likely to be more of a political exercise, putting pressure on vulnerable GOP senators to break from the party line or face Democratic attacks over the next year of campaigning.\n\nEnvironmental advocates and a coalition of states have already begun what\u2019s expected to be a lengthy legal challenge over the Trump administration\u2019s Affordable Clean Energy regulation on power plant emissions, which have been the subject of heated debate in Congress for the better part of the decade.\n\n\u201cThe EPA has abdicated its responsibility in promulgating this deeply flawed rule and the Senate will abdicate its responsibility if it fails to repeal the ACE rule,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.).\n\nBack in 2015, the full Senate passed two resolutions largely along party lines disapproving of the centerpieces of Obama\u2019s climate change agenda. The political calculus may be similar this time around. Moderate Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, broke with their party at the time to vote against the resolutions, while coal-state Democrats, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, backed them.\n\nAaron Lorenzo contributed to this report.\n\nThis report first appeared on politico.com on Oct. 10, 2019.", "description": "\u201cSenator McConnell and Senate Republicans have shunned vital proposals to improve American\u2019s lives,\u201d Schumer said.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett", "Anthony Adragna"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/39/f8/1924f4894a2bbb99858fedd4662e/chuck-schumer-4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
