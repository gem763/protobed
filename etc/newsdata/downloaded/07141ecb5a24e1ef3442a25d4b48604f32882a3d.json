The actor has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.\n\nDressed in a black suit, a white pocket square, and handcuffs, the Jerry Maguire actor remained quiet during his brief arraignment as prosecutors described the additional incident that halted the star\u2019s already postponed trial last Thursday.\n\nThe indictment, which was unsealed Tuesday, alleges that on Oct. 24, 2018, Gooding \u201cpinched the buttocks of\u201d the woman \u201cwithout her consent\u201d while at TAO Downtown Nightclub in Manhattan. When the woman, who has not been identified, confronted the star, he allegedly \u201cclaimed that he had only pinched her back, not her buttocks.\u201d\n\nProsecutors allege Gooding started to \u201craise his voice\u201d as he continued to deny the woman\u2019s claims, getting so angry that he said \u201che would never return to that nightclub again.\u201d The woman claimed the assault occurred shortly after Gooding made a \u201csexually suggestive remark.\u201d\n\nGooding\u2019s defense attorney, Mark Heller, spoke to reporters outside the courthouse hours before his appearance to confirm the star surrendered to police Tuesday morning. He also suggested the latest charges are short on viable evidence\u2014a claim he continued inside the courtroom.\n\n\u201cIt has been 124 days since the arrest of Cuba Gooding Jr., and in my opinion the District Attorney\u2019s office has tormented Mr. Gooding, knowing that his life and his career has been put on hold and cooly delaying this prosecution,\u201d Heller said in court before asking the judge to sever the two allegations into separate cases \u201cas to not prejudice Mr. Gooding.\u201d\n\nHeller also said \u201cthe indictment constitutes a disillusioned overreaction,\u201d and likened it to the \u201cincredible condemnation\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden faced after touching \u201ca woman\u2019s shoulder.\u201d\n\nThe latest allegations come just months after prosecutors initially charged Gooding for groping a woman at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar & Lounge in Times Square on June 9.\n\nProsecutors allege the 29-year-old woman, who has not been identified, met the \u201cheavily intoxicated\u201d actor during a night out with friends and offered him a cup of water. While the two of them were in the midst of a conversation, the woman alleged, The People v. O.J. Simpson star groped her breasts.\n\nThe 29-year-old allegedly left the bar and immediately called authorities, but Gooding was no longer at the bar when officers arrived. Shortly after the actor voluntarily surrendered to the police to be arrested, TMZ published surveillance footage allegedly showing the incident.\n\nIn the latest indictment, prosecutors detailed a dozen uncharged allegations from women who have accused the actor of sexual misconduct over the last decade, attempting to show a pattern of behavior. The women, known as Molineux witnesses because their allegations involve uncharged crimes, plan to testify at his trial, prosecutors said.\n\nOne woman said she was at the W Hotel in Los Angeles in 2001 when Gooding \u201crubbed his groin and pelvis against her buttocks while he simultaneously grabbed her buttocks and her breast with his hand.\n\nAnother woman alleges that she approached Gooding while at the Yard House in Long Beach, Calif., in 2003. After posing for a picture together, Gooding allegedly \u201cplaced his hand\u201d on the woman\u2019s butt and \u201csqueezed, without her consent,\u201d before saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good piece of ass.\u201d The woman, who was not identified, allegedly walked away with her friends, but Gooding followed her to her table. The star also allegedly \u201cattempted to make sexual advances\u201d on the woman\u2019s friend and \u201ckissed her hand.\u201d\n\nAnother woman alleges that in 2006, Gooding \u201cbit her shoulder, on her bare back\u201d at the bar Chi in Hollywood and \u201cshrugged\u201d when she questioned him before biting her a second time.\n\nWhen the woman \u201cturned around to face the defendant a second time,\u201d the indictment alleges, \u201che placed his finger to his lips indicating for the woman to remain quiet.\u201d \u201cThe defendant then began to thrust his pelvis against\u201d the woman\u2019s leg and \u201cattempted to lift the bottom of her shirt up,\u201d the documents state.\n\nA year later, while at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, the star allegedly \u201cforcibly pulled\u201d another woman toward him in an attempt to kiss her. When she pulled away, Gooding allegedly \u201clicked her face and grabbed her buttocks with his hand.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also allege that in 2011, while at a Los Angeles bar, Gooding grabbed another woman \u201cby the arm,\u201d placed \u201chis hand inside the woman\u2019s blouse and squeezed her bare breast,\u201d and then said, \u201cSit on my face, pee in my mouth.\u201d\n\nGooding has not been charged in these alleged incidents, but his lawyer said he is aware of the additional claims.\n\nThe star was released on his own recognizance Tuesday and is expected to return to court Dec. 13.", "description": "The actor\u2019s lawyer called the latest indictment a \u201cdisillusioned overreaction,\u201d comparing it to the \u201cincredible condemnation\u201d Joe Biden faced after touching \u201ca woman\u2019s shoulder.\u201d", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2024,w_3600,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571159288/RTS2QHKN_jutbdl", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
