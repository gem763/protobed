Adam Schiff (D-CA) prevented Republicans from asking impeachment probe witness Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House\u2019s top Ukraine expert, some questions at his closed-door deposition in the Capitol basement Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats have accused Republicans of trying to figure out who the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is with their line of questioning during Vindman\u2019s deposition.\n\nJordan, who witnessed Vindman\u2019s deposition, said he could not go into explicit detail about the questions Schiff blocked. The Ohio lawmaker, however, explained to reporters:\n\n[House Intelligence Committee] Chairman Schiff has prevented the witness from answering certain questions we had during the deposition. \u2026 When we asked [Vindman] who he spoke to after important events in July. Adam Schiff said, \u201cNo, no, no\u201d we\u2019re not going to let him answer that question. Even though at the start of every one of these depositions \u2026 he says, \u201cThis is not classified.\u201d\n\nSchiff is the leader of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are conducting the impeachment investigation.\n\nWhile briefing reporters alongside Jordan, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) acknowledged that Schiff\u2019s decision to block some questions had undermined his claim that the process is fair.\n\nScalise noted:\n\nEven his claim now that [the process is fair because] Republicans can ask questions has been undermined because he is now directing witnesses not to answer questions that he doesn\u2019t want the witness to answer \u2026 He has not cut off one Democrat. He has not interrupted one Democrat. \u2026 That reeks, and by the way, if you want to talk about a Soviet-style process, again, that might be what they do in the Soviet Union. Not in the United States of America.\n\nHe added that the behind-closed-doors impeachment process \u201chas been rotten to the core.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been highly critical of the fact that it completely denies due process to Republican members of Congress as well as to the White House,\u201d Scalise also said.\n\nJordan dismissed criticism from Democrats who say the Republicans were trying to find out who the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d that triggered the impeachment probe is.\n\n\u201cWe are just trying to get information that we are entitled to get, and the witness is supposed to answer our questions,\u201d Jordan, the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, declared.\n\nJordan noted that he wants to talk to \u201chalf a dozen\u201d sources cited by the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d in the complaint that triggered the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to determine someone\u2019s credibility if you don\u2019t know who they are, and you can\u2019t put them under oath and ask them questions,\u201d he added.\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told reporters that Republicans were trying to find out the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d identity during Vindman\u2019s deposition.\n\n\u201cWhat the Republicans are trying to do in there, very clearly in their questioning, is try to front-door or backdoor Lt. Col. Vindman into revealing who the whistleblower is, even though in his testimony, he said he didn\u2019t know,\u201d she proclaimed,\n\nIn his leaked opening remarks, Vindman said, \u201cI want the Committees to know I am not the whistleblower who brought this issue to the CIA and the Committees\u2019 attention. I do not know who the whistleblower is and I would not feel comfortable to speculate as to the identity of the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nUkrainian-American Vindman is a decorated Army officer who serves as the director of European affairs at White House\u2019s National Security Council (NSC). He listened to the infamous July 25 call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. The call is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn a complaint that sparked the probe, the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d accused Trump of pressuring Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for aid. Trump and Zelensky have denied the allegation.", "description": "Schiff prevented Republicans from asking impeachment probe witness Lt. Col.
