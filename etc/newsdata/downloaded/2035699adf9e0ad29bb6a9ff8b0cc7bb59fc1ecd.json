Tesla shares soared 18% Thursday -- the biggest jump in 6 1/2 years -- following a surprise quarterly profit report. The rally vaulted the company back above General Motors Co. as the top U.S. automaker by market capitalization.\n\nThe words of praise may have been a response in kind to Musk, 48, who tweeted last month that Diess was \u201cdoing more than any big carmaker to go electric.\u201d Four years after VW admitted to cheating on diesel emissions tests -- a scandal that has cost the company more than $30 billion -- it\u2019s committed to spend almost $50 billion on electric vehicles.\n\nThe key question for Tesla\u2019s planned global expansion is whether capital markets continue to provide funding for its growing operations, Diess said.\n\n\u201cScaling up globally is difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe car industry is very capital intense, and electric cars make it even more capital intense.\u201d\n\n(Adds VW CEO comment in seventh paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christoph Rauwald in Frankfurt at crauwald@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net, Chester Dawson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- There appears to be a budding bromance between the CEOs of Volkswagen AG, the world\u2019s largest automaker, and Tesla Inc., the electric-car company suddenly back on the ascent.At an event where VW was presenting the new Golf hatchback late Thursday, Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess", "authors": ["Christoph Rauwald"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NLOj7KXjkqbc24KytxJ9ig--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/450b9a248c83882733dd01b29ef5f50c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
