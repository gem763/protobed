The estimates were made in a report from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), entitled The Cost of Doing Nothing, presented to the UN on Thursday evening.\n\nFrancesco Rocca, president of the IFRC, said: \u201cThis confirms the impact that climate change is having, and will continue to have, on some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. The cost of doing nothing is high, and it\u2019s the most vulnerable who will have to pay if we don\u2019t act. This is intolerable.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of the strain that climate-related disasters were already placing on humanitarian agencies and donors. \u201cGlobally, most humanitarian appeals are already underfunded and have been for a number of years. It doesn\u2019t seem realistic to expect that the system will be able to accommodate such a massive increase in need,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething needs to change.\u201d\n\nYet with adequate spending, efforts to increase the resilience of vulnerable people and action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the number of people caught up in climate-related disasters could be cut drastically, the report found. Timely adaptation to the likely effects of climate change, and lower levels of global heating, would mean just 10 million people would need humanitarian aid a year because of climate-related problems in 2050, a fraction of the 100 million afflicted today.\n\nSome of the measures needed to prevent disaster are relatively low-tech, and cheap to put in place. Early warning systems for floods and storms, and access to weather forecasts in remote regions can all improve preparedness. Restoring natural features such as mangrove swamps and wetlands can protect against coastal and river flooding, while regrowing tree cover on hillsides can prevent landslips.\n\nRocca said: \u201cThere is a chance to do something. By investing in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction, including through efforts to improve early warning and anticipatory humanitarian action, the world can avoid a future marked by escalating suffering and ballooning humanitarian response costs. But we have to act now.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the UK\u2019s Department for International Development said the climate emergency was already high on the agenda, with overseas aid money being spent on projects aimed at preventing climate-related disasters. \u201cClimate change is the greatest challenge the world is facing and it will hit the poorest the hardest,\u201d they said. \u201cTackling climate change and protecting our environment is a top priority. We are working to make the poorest communities better prepared for disasters and more able to deal with their aftermath.\u201d", "description": "Charity warns of cost of doing nothing, saying contributions would need to hit $20bn a year", "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/342e090354e86955890b24164d1a33ea9f771e92/0_115_1776_1066/master/1776.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b91187bea1d12bdb7e45ac64c686888", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
