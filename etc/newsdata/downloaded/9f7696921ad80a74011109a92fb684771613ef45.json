Comedians Debate Critics", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Craig Barritt/Getty Images for New York Magazi\n\nThe Emmys (or at least the Emmys you will actually be watching on TV) are fast approaching, and with it comes another awards-show edition of Comedians vs. Critics, presented by Vulture and NeueHouse. As we gear up for television\u2019s biggest night this Sunday, we\u2019re reminded that this year\u2019s ceremony will be missing one major element: a host. Last year\u2019s Emmys hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che may turn out to be the ceremony\u2019s final MCs, as this year\u2019s hostless Oscars inspired Fox to follow suit. This begs the question: Are we just not going to have hosts for things anymore? Is this a disturbing trend or a new way of life? Will all award presenters be eternally introduced by a faceless, monotonous voice from the sky?? Right as Hailee Steinfeld is hitting her stride????\n\nThe answers to these questions were hashed out on Tuesday night at Brookfield Place in Manhattan, when two of the world\u2019s most culturally influential groups \u2014 comedians and critics \u2014 got together to debate not necessarily how things will be but how they should be. Hosts Catherine Cohen and Pat Regan oversaw the proceedings with the gravitas of a John Bercow who can dance to the Succession theme. Meanwhile comedians Rachel Pegram, Sam Taggart, and Natalie Walker took on the critical minds of Vulture\u2019s Hunter Harris, Jackson McHenry, and Kathryn VanArendonk. In the end the critics prevailed overall with an impassioned argument for Fleabag to win best comedy, complete with VanArendonk sporting the iconic Fleabag jumpsuit. But in the end, it\u2019s not about who wins or loses the debate, it\u2019s about whether Julia Louis-Dreyfus will win her 12th Emmy.", "description": "Catherine Cohen and Pat Regan hosted a debate between comedians and critics, including Rachel Pegram, Sam Taggart, and Natalie Walker", "authors": ["Anne Victoria Clark"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/19/18-brookfield-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
