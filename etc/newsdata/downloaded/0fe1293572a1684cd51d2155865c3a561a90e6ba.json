Workers Say They Sacrificed, and Now They Want Their Due", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump, who even before taking office castigated G.M. for shifting production to Mexico, returned to the theme on Monday in comments at the White House. While he said he was \u201csad to see the strike\u201d and hoped it would be short, he emphasized his relationship with autoworkers, and added: \u201cI don\u2019t want General Motors to be building plants outside of this country. You know they built many plants in China and Mexico, and I don\u2019t like that at all.\u201d\n\nUnder the contract just ended, workers have gotten a share of G.M.\u2019s profits averaging $11,000 a year over the last three years. But some contend that the U.A.W. failed to push hard enough as G.M. and the other automakers bounced back over the last decade, including the union\u2019s efforts in the last contract talks four years ago.\n\n\u201cThe leadership is feeling some pressure from below to deliver something better than what we got in 2015,\u201d Martha Grevatt, a U.A.W. member who retired from a Fiat Chrysler plant in Michigan earlier this year, said in an interview in August.\n\nAfter making G.M. its target, the U.A.W. extended its contracts with Ford and Fiat Chrysler. The G.M. outcome is meant to set a pattern for the other companies.\n\nBut G.M. is looking to cut costs, or at least avoid cost increases, in a difficult business environment. Auto sales are slowing in the United States and China, the world\u2019s largest and most lucrative markets, and the company is spending billions of dollars to develop electric vehicles and self-driving cars.\n\nIt still has room to get leaner. At the end of last year, G.M. had the capacity to make one million more vehicles that it was selling, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.", "description": "Nearly 50,000 union members are striking for what they see as a fair share of the company\u2019s hefty returns, a decade after its bankruptcy.", "authors": ["Neal E.
