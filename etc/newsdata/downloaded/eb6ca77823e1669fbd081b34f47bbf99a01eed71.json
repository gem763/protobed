The Duchess of Cambridge has taken a number of high-profile photographs in the past which have been shared with media outlets, including three new photos of Prince Louis released to celebrate his first birthday in April this year.\n\nREAD MORE: The Duchess of Cambridge's affordable royal tour outfit you may have missed\n\nAsked who his favourite photographic subject was, O'Neill \u2013 who has photographed the likes of Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela to Elvis Presley and Nicole Kidman \u2013 told the PA news agency it had to be the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\n\"There have been some incredible people,\" he said. \"I couldn't really even compare - his (the Duke of Cambridge's) wife is also an excellent subject.\"\n\nBut, good looks aside, what exactly is it about the Duchess which makes her so photogenic?\n\nIt\u2019s a combination of preparation (strategically planned makeup, hair and outfits) and how she composes herself in front of the camera, explains photographer Grace Robinson.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge is regularly pictured side on. [Photo: Getty] More\n\nHair and makeup\n\n\u201cKate's hair is always styled to perfection, her most common style is loose waves, or curls, and it\u2019s always pushed to the front of her shoulders,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cThis frames the face perfect for any image as her hair colour compliments her skin tone and makeup perfectly.\u201d\n\nHer makeup is also always \u201cphoto-ready\u201d, with a natural look. \u201cShe never goes over the top - too much makeup or the incorrect makeup style for your face shape can really show up negatively on camera,\u201d adds Robinson.\n\nStyle\n\nThe Duchess \u201cknows what outfits work best for her\u201d and dresses in a specific way if she is going to be photographed at events \u2013 adding volume to her bottom half \u2013 which is more flattering, explains Robinson.\n\nREAD MORE: Duchess of Cambridge wore \u00a328 trainers to play cricket in Pakistan\n\n\u201cShe has a slim figure, so her dresses and outfits usually accentuate the top half of the body and are loose fitting from the waist downwards. This is not only flattering for Kates body shape but more comfortable when sitting and gives photographs movement and life when walking,\u201d she adds.\n\nPosture\n\nAs for when she\u2019s in the limelight, the Duchess does three things to make herself look more photogenic, Robinson reveals.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge often wears clothing which adds volume to her bottom half. [Photo: Getty] More\n\nHer number one trick is that she always faces the camera side on when photographs are being taken \u2013 \u201cthis way the face looks slimmer and the jaw line is accentuated,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cShe is rarely photographed front on, which can cause loss of definition in the face in photographs.\u201d\n\nAs for the rest, the Duchess always makes sure she smiles in public \u2013 \u201cthis brings energy and warmth to her photographs\u201d \u2013 and maintains perfect posture: \u201cSmiling is infectious and encourages the photographer to keep snapping until they get the perfect shot,\u201d finishes Robinson.", "description": "As anyone who\u2019s seen photos of the 37-year-old knows, she is extremely photogenic.", "authors": ["Francesca Specter", "Yahoo Style Uk Deputy Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LSzAZ4LsHBo56yu3RGftGw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6b90ca40-f5a9-11e9-bb99-4b0785591339", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
