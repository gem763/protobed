She loved to bang on the glass at her brother\u2019s hockey games, and Anello expected she would do the same there. But the window was open. She fell some 115 feet to the ground.\n\nAnello \u201cnegligently exposed the child to the abyss through a window,\u201d according to a news release from Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Justice. The Indiana man turned himself in Monday, according to an attorney for family members, and a judge set bail at $80,000. Anello, who is married to Chloe\u2019s maternal grandmother, posted bail and was allowed to return home Tuesday, the lawyer said through a representative. A preliminary hearing has been set for Nov. 20.\n\nIt was not clear who his defense attorney is.\n\n[Parents of toddler who fell from cruise ship blame Royal Caribbean]\n\n\u201cThese criminal charges are pouring salt on the open wounds of this grieving family,\" Michael Winkleman, an attorney for the Wiegands in a planned civil suit against the Miami-based cruise line, said in a statement. \"Clearly, this was a tragic accident, and the family\u2019s singular goal remains for something like this to never happen again. Had the cruise lines simply followed proper safety guidelines for windows, this accident likely would never have happened.\u201d\n\nHe said that Royal Caribbean has not provided surveillance video of the incident to the family.\n\nChloe\u2019s parents, Kimberly and Alan Wiegand, blamed the cruise company in an interview with NBC News\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show. They said Anello, whom they call Sam, was overwhelmed with grief.\n\n\u201cHe was extremely hysterical,\u201d Kimberly Wiegand said. \u201cThe thing that he has repeatedly told us is, \u2018I believed that there was glass.\u2019 He will cry over and over. At no point ever, ever, has Sam ever put our kids in danger.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Royal Caribbean said, \u201cThis was a tragic incident, and out of respect for the family\u2019s privacy, we refer you to authorities for further comment.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTourists recall a mother\u2019s tormented cries after toddler fell from cruise ship to her death\n\nIs cruising safe?
