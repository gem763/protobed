(REUTERS/Mike Blake)\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position on religious liberty isn\u2019t uncommon.\n\nDuring CNN\u2019s Equality Town Hall last week, Don Lemon asked O\u2019Rourke, \u201cDo you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities \u2014 should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded, \u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights of every single one of us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following day his campaign clarified that O\u2019Rourke meant no rewards, benefits, or tax breaks should be conferred on institutions that take discriminatory action related to same-sex marriage (as opposed to holding \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d beliefs regarding the same).\n\nMuch of the ensuing commentary characterized O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position as unrepresentative of the progressive view of the intersection of religious belief and nondiscrimination. But, in fact, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments are unremarkable on the Left, which generally elevates nondiscrimination over religious liberty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe increasing tension between principles of nondiscrimination and religious liberty is a complicated issue. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights held an expansive hearing on the matter a few years ago titled, \u201cPeaceful Coexistence: Reconciling Nondiscrimination Principles with Civil Liberties.\u201d\n\nThe Left\u2019s forthright hostility toward religious freedom was noteworthy. There was little peaceful coexistence and even less of an effort to balance the interests of religious freedom with nondiscrimination. The progressive-dominated commission held that in almost every instance in which the two principles intersect, religious freedom must yield to nondiscrimination.\n\nThe Left\u2019s view of religious liberty perhaps was best captured by then- Chairman Martin Castro\u2019s claim that \u201c[t]he phrases \u2018religious liberty\u2019 and \u2018religious freedom\u2019 will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Christian supremacy, or any form of intolerance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, many on the Left view tolerance only as a one-way street.", "description": "Beto O'Rourke's position on religious liberty isn't uncommon.", "authors": ["Peter Kirsanow", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
