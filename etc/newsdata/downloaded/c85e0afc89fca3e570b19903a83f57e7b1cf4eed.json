That\u2019s murder.\u201d\n\nHer family told KXAS television that Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed early Saturday.\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department said in a statement that officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after \u201cperceiving a threat.\u201d The video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, \u201cPut your hands up, show me your hands.\u201d One shot is then fired through a window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us,\u201d said Jefferson\u2019s sister, Amber Carr.\n\n\u201cYou know, you want to see justice, but justice don\u2019t bring my sister back,\u201d Carr said.\n\nAn aunt, Venitta Body, said the family does not understand why Jefferson was killed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like from the moment we got the call, it\u2019s been more and more inconceivable and more confusing. And there has nothing been done in order to take away that confusion,\u201d Body said.\n\nPolice Lt. Brandon O\u2019Neil said Sunday that the officer, who\u2019s been on the force since April 2018, is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation and will be interviewed about the fatal shooting on Monday. His name was not released.\n\nAt a brief news conference at police headquarters, O\u2019Neil confirmed that the officer did not announce he was police before he fired the fatal shot and that his failure to do so is part of the department\u2019s investigation.\n\nO\u2019Neil also confirmed that Jefferson\u2019s 8-year-old nephew was in the room with Jefferson when she was shot. He said representatives of the police department have spoken with the woman\u2019s family and \u201cshared our serious and heartfelt concern for this unspeakable loss.\u201d Her family has said she was watching her nephew at the time.\n\nO\u2019Neil declined to answer reporters\u2019 questions and said Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus plans to conduct a more in-depth news conference on Monday.\n\nJames Smith, who called a police non-emergency number about the open door, told reporters he was just trying to be a good neighbor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shaken. I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m upset. And I feel it\u2019s partly my fault,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf I had never dialed the police department, she\u2019d still be alive.\u201d\n\nSmith said Jefferson and her nephew typically lived with an older woman, who\u2019s been in the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt makes you not want to call the police department,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an audio recording of Smith\u2019s call that was released by police, the neighbor said it was \u201cnot normal\u201d for the house to leave its front door open for hours at that time of day.\n\nMerritt said Jefferson\u2019s family expects \u201ca thorough and expedient investigation.\u201d\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department said it released bodycam footage soon after the shooting to provide transparency, but that any \u201ccamera footage inside the residence\u201d could not be distributed due to state law. However, the bodycam video released to media included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom at the home. It\u2019s unclear if the firearm was found near the woman, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she had a gun. The police statement released Saturday said only that officers who entered the residence after the shooting found a firearm. Police did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Sunday.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday called on the Justice Department to investigate.\n\n\u201cThe killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end,\u201d Sanders tweeted. \u201cAtatiana Jefferson should be alive.\u201d\n\nThe shooting comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of her black neighbor inside his own apartment. Amber Guyger, 31, said during her trial that mistook Botham Jean\u2019s apartment for her own, which was one floor below Jean\u2019s. Merritt also represents Jean\u2019s family.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the initial police statement said officers found a firearm after the shooting.", "description": "FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 A white police officer who killed a black woman inside her Texas home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/bb3b3c_police-shooting-in-home-texas-57929-in-saturday-oct-12-2019-image-body-camera-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
