The 30-year bond yield fell 6.8 basis points to 2.130%. Bond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nWhat's driving Treasurys?\n\nInvestors dived into government bonds following soft economic data that put the spotlight on the eurozone's economic doldrums.

It seems that the malaise in manufacturing -- owed to trade and Brexit worries -- has started to spread to the much larger services sector as well,\" wrote Hadjikyriacos.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 23, 2019 07:09 ET (11:09 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
