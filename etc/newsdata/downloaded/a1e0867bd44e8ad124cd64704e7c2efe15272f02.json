The conceit behind them is that you\u2019d put them in strategic areas around your home or wherever you wanted to make memories. It\u2019d detect ideal lighting or framing, and take photos of its own accord \u2014 which, in theory, sounds like something that\u2019d provide some great candid shots or video clips.\n\nBut surprisingly, having a camera taking pictures of your family of its own accord didn\u2019t exactly endear itself to customers, especially not for the princely sum of $249. Or I assume that\u2019s why. It could also be that, according to rumors, the Clips weren\u2019t actually that proficient at taking good pics and users would frequently have to filter through hundreds just to find one or two decent shots. Either way, RIP Clips.\n\nI felt a pang when I saw the story break on 9to5Google, not because I used Clips myself, but because I covered their initial reveal at the Pixel 2 event in 2017. I found them kind of fascinating \u2014 this is the kind of bizarro tech people in the past pictured would be super commonplace by this point in history (or I assume, anyway; I\u2019m not a time traveler, I swear).\n\nBut it makes sense the company would trim some fat before the release of its next round of hardware. Hindsight being 20/20, now that they\u2019re gone, it\u2019s kind of amazing that Clips ever made it out of the planning stages. They just didn\u2019t seem like something that\u2019d appeal to a great deal of people.\n\nIn addition to Clips, Google also shuttered its Daydream VR platform and said it would no longer be supported by the latest Pixel phones. The original Pixel Buds also vanished from the store \u2014 though in that case, it\u2019s likely because they\u2019ll be replaced with new models early next year.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is putting all of its efforts in the new Pixel 4, the Pixelbook Go, and of course Stadia.\n\nRIP Google Clips, you weird little automatic camera on 9to5Google\n\nRead next: Study: Facial recognition AI's alright, if you're cisgender and white", "description": "Google sunsets Clips, that bizarre, palm-sized camera that took pictures autonomously.
