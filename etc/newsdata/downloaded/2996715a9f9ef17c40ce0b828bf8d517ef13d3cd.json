Fashion's toughest fabric has smartened up its act", "language": "en", "text": "Are you a leather skirt sort of woman? I\u2019m still not sure I am. A few years back I bought one from Whistles (unlined, flared, black), which I\u2019ve never worn; I can\u2019t quite get past the feeling that it\u2019s too slick and polished.\n\nBut I\u2019ve held on to it, knowing that could change. It only takes a mood shift, maybe sparked by one outfit on one catwalk, and suddenly you\u2019re in new territory looking at everything differently.\n\nAnd that shift is happening. The aviator jacket I passed on to my stepdaughter, in the certain knowledge I wouldn\u2019t wear it again. Hmm. Not so sure now. The biker jacket gathering dust in the cloakroom \u2014 wore it yesterday. The leather trousers I got rid of years ago because that\u2019s not happening . . . well, maybe it could, if they weren\u2019t tight, and they were cropped, and you wore them with a chunky heeled sandal and a blazer, say?\n\nShane Watson shared advice for embracing this season's leather trend, pictured: Jacket, \u00a3595, reiss.com; trousers, \u00a329.99, zara.com; shoes, \u00a3195, lkbennett. com; bag, \u00a335, Marks & Spencer\n\nCoat, \u00a3229, massimodutti. com; jumper, \u00a3290, meandem. com; skirt, \u00a3250, reiss.com; shoes, \u00a3195, lkbennett.com; bag, \u00a329.99, zara.com\n\nFor various reasons (namely Celine: chic tweed, plus leather jacket, plus boots), leather is looking more sophisticated and wearable than it has done in years. Anyone old enough to remember saving up for one of those Agnes B leather jackets in the late Eighties \u2014 that glossy ladylike leather mood is back.\n\nYou\u2019re wearing leather like a French yummy mummy, with heels and starched jeans or over your dark floral midi-dress. It\u2019s not a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll leather moment, it\u2019s more smooth, with a silk scarf, a blowdry and a stacked heel.\n\nFor this reason, quality is all important. The leather has to be soft and the details immaculate: bone buttons, quality zips, good stitching.\n\nMost things look more expensive in black, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case with leather, and for now, darker colours like chocolate and forest green work well and can be more forgiving (see the dark blue coat by Kley at Debenhams, pictured far right).\n\nThe best return for your investment has to be a leather jacket of some sort. There are belted styles (see Reiss, pictured far left), but the most on-trend would be a Celine-esque blouson style or a neat, waisted biker jacket (Marks & Spencer Autograph in copper tan, \u00a3250, marksandspencer.com).\n\nThe advantage of a leather jacket this season is it adds metropolitan edge to all those affluent bourgeois lady looks, de-countrifies all the cord and tweed and sharpens up denim or a floaty dress. The leather shacket (the shirt-style leather jacket) is more casual and less versatile (Rachel Leather shirt, \u00a3379, baukjen.com), but if you want something to glam up your weekend, this will do the job.\n\nBlazer, \u00a3139, massimo dutti.com; jumper, \u00a3225, reiss.com; trousers, \u00a3299, jigsaw-online. com; shoes, \u00a3245, russell andbromley.co.uk\n\nShirt, \u00a3379, baukjen. com; skirt, \u00a339.50, Marks & Spencer; shoes, \u00a3195, lkbennett. com\n\nFor dress lovers, the maximum return style (you can dress it up or down, roll up the sleeves, add a polo neck) is also a shirt in dress form (\u00a3699, baukjen.com). This one in chocolate brown looks neat with boots, but you\u2019ve got to belt it or you\u2019ll look like a leather pipe.\n\nSkirts are obviously the easier option; there\u2019s no one style \u2014 wraps, pencils, midis with splits, zip-fronted, they\u2019re all out there \u2014 but when it comes to picking a leather skirt only three rules apply: Can you sit down? Do you feel relaxed? Is it skimming or packing-in? The packed-in look is a potential hazard of leather and to be avoided. Also, it goes without saying that if you\u2019re wearing a fitted pencil skirt, then avoid the silk blouse and stiletto heels (even if it did work for Stella Gibson in The Fall). The more I think about it, the more I might give it a go, but with a fitted cashmere sweater and boots.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the \u2018do you or don\u2019t you\u2019 trouser question. We\u2019re no longer talking about leather jeans, skinny leather leggings or (my b\u00eate noir) leather in the front/Lycra at the back, but mid-waisted, straight-legged and cropped. The fact they\u2019re not tight makes them a very different proposition, and the crop gives them a lighter look and takes away all the Thin Lizzy associations. Fashion girls have been snapping up the cropped leather style from Arket (\u00a3250, arket.com) to wear with cord blazers and these ones from Jigsaw (above) are a good shape. Is there a cut-off age for leather trousers? Not unless you look like you were wearing them to a Nineties Guns n\u2019 Roses gig.\n\nDress, \u00a3699, baukjen.com; shoes, \u00a3195, lkbennett.com; bag, \u00a329.99, zara.com\n\nJacket, \u00a3250, jumper, \u00a379, and skirt, \u00a335, all Marks & Spencer; shoes, \u00a3195, lkbennett.com", "description": "Shane Watson shared advice for embracing this season's leather trend, as seen in High Street stores and luxury retailers such as Celine.
