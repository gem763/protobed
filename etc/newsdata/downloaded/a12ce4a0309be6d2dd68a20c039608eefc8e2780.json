You\u2019ll find the more professionally strategic you are, the more successful the weekend will be.\n\nTAURUS April 21-May 21 ***\n\nHave you got a problem that\u2019s really perplexing you? Take the time to find an appropriate solution that works in the long-term. Slow, smart and steady wins the race at the moment Bulls!\n\nGEMINI May 22-June 21 ****\n\nGeminis often have a superficial knowledge about a lot of different topics.

Perhaps it\u2019s time to take a more thorough peek back into the past?\n\nLEO July 24-Aug 23 ***\n\nAvoid being a know-it-all. When it comes to a work problem or a relationship issue, things are much more complex than they appear. So it will take time to get to the bottom of the real situation.\n\nVIRGO Aug 24-Sep 23 ****\n\nThe best research tools you can use are the internet, local friends and family connections. With all three on your side, you can tick the to-do list and power through projects with ease.\n\nLIBRA Sep 24-Oct 23 ***\n\nPut aside some quality time so you can share a profound new insight with a special loved one.

Which is just what Scorpios like to do!\n\nSAGITTARIUS Nov 23-Dec 21 ***\n\nMarvellous Mercury/Pluto aspects make for a stimulating weekend \u2013 mentally and physically. So get out there Sagittarius and get things moving and shaking! But avoid being rash with cash.\n\nCAPRICORN Dec 22-Jan 20 ***\n\nAll types of communication are favoured as you converse with a wide range of family, friends and acquaintances.

Scrutinise it thoroughly first.\n\nAQUARIUS Jan 21-Feb 19 ***\n\nWith the Moon visiting your wellbeing zone, nurture yourself with some of your favourite healthy and hearty treats. Focused work and intense study are also favoured this weekend.\n\nPISCES Feb 20-March 20 ***\n\nYour motto for the weekend is from birthday great, singer-songwriter-musician Tom Petty. \u201cGo after what you really love and find a way to make it work for you, and then you\u2019ll be a happy person.\u201d\n\nSATURDAY\n\nYOUR DAY\n\nToday\u2019s stars favour intellectual discussions, rigorous research and uncovering secrets.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nYou are an independent individual. The coming year is the time to balance personal freedom with cosy companionship.\n\nSUNDAY\n\nYOUR DAY\n\nTake the time to nurture family members and close friends today.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nModeration and flexibility are the keys to a successful 2020.
