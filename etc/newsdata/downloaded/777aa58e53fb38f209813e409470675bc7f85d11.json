Border patrol detained one of the ships, reportedly prompting the other to open fire in a small skirmish that led to the injury of three Russian border patrol officials and several North Korean sailors. The entire North Korean expedition, numbering 161 personnel, was detained in the aftermath of the shootout.\n\nFar from an isolated case, this incident is the culmination of a long-running series of fishing tensions between North Korea and its Russian neighbor. According to Aleksei Maslov, director of the Center for Strategic Studies of China and one of Russia\u2019s foremost East Asia experts, \u201cunfortunately, North Korean piracy and illegal fishing have always existed in one form or another within our territorial waters.\u201d Maslov asserts that Russian authorities have turned a blind eye to similar North Korean behavior for years, but that the armed, 161-strong poaching expedition was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back: \u201cI think [our] patience snapped, our border guards began enforcing the law, and DPRK realized that the warnings are over.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Is a crisis brewing over illegal fishing?", "authors": ["Mark Episkopos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OG0RiaoGVFmXVdPwcLk7oA--~B/aD05Nzg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b678ab047e072bfcf78590e4e5145d3e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
