Bush and Barack Obama, believes President Trump\u2019s decision to abandon America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria is a betrayal that is eroding the country\u2019s reputation both at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cIf our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us?\u201d McRaven wrote in a scathing New York Times op-ed published Thursday. \u201cIf we can\u2019t have faith in our nation\u2019s principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military? And if they don\u2019t join, who will protect us? If we are not the champions of the good and the right, then who will follow us? And if no one follows us \u2014 where will the world end up?\u201d\n\nThe op-ed was published the same day the White House announced it had brokered a temporary ceasefire in Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria. But critics, including GOP Sens. Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham, said Trump effectively caved to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nMcRaven said that during a military ceremony at Fort Bragg, N.C., last week, a retired four-star general grabbed his arm and shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u201d\n\nAdm. William McRaven and President Trump (Photos: Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis via Getty Images, Alex Wong/Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cThose words echoed with me throughout the week,\u201d McRaven wrote. \u201cWe are not the most powerful nation in the world because of our aircraft carriers, our economy, or our seat at the United Nations Security Council. We are the most powerful nation in the world because we try to be the good guys. We are the most powerful nation in the world because our ideals of universal freedom and equality have been backed up by our belief that we were champions of justice, the protectors of the less fortunate.\n\n\u201cBut, if we don\u2019t care about our values,\u201d he continued, \u201cif we don\u2019t care about duty and honor, if we don\u2019t help the weak and stand up against oppression and injustice \u2014 what will happen to the Kurds, the Iraqis, the Afghans, the Syrians, the Rohingyas, the South Sudanese and the millions of people under the boot of tyranny or left abandoned by their failing states?\n\n\u201cPresident Trump seems to believe that these qualities are unimportant or show weakness,\u201d McRaven added. \u201cHe is wrong. These are the virtues that have sustained this nation for the past 243 years. If we hope to continue to lead the world and inspire a new generation of young men and women to our cause, then we must embrace these values now more than ever.\u201d\n\nAnd if not, \u201cthen it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2014 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2014 the sooner, the better,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fate of our Republic depends upon it.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "William McRaven, a former head of the U.S. Special Operations Command, says the president\u2019s decision to abandon America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria is a betrayal that is eroding the country\u2019s reputation both at home and abroad.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z5eKnu9GiamYQNcReD9t5Q--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/abf4f160-f1b2-11e9-bfcf-c545db6382cd", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
