There is no cure.\n\nGeorgina was diagnosed just a few weeks before her 27th birthday, after experiencing a year of cold hands that turned blue while she worked at a salon, swollen fingers that felt sore and stiff, aching in her wrists and forearms, and severe pain in her hips.\n\nShe went back and forth to her doctor but was dismissed as a hypochondriac or told that her pain was simply due to repetitive strain injury as a result of cutting hair.\n\nGeorgina before being diagnosed with scleroderma (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\nThen came the breathing problems, which left Georgina waking up in the middle of the night gasping for air. Her skin turned red and inflamed, as if she had sunburn, and pus-weeping ulcers developed on her fingers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon her hands were stiff, curled, and excruciatingly painful.\n\n\u2018Doing simple things like getting dressed was a real struggle,\u2019 Georgina tells Metro.co.uk. \u2018My skin was tightening, I was losing mobility. I could feel weakness and fatigue in my muscles.\n\nWhat is scleroderma? Scleroderma is an uncommon condition that results in hard, thickened areas of skin and sometimes problems with internal organs and blood vessels. Scleroderma is caused by the immune system attacking the connective tissue under the skin and around internal organs and blood vessels. This causes scarring and thickening of the tissue in these areas. It\u2019s thought scleroderma occurs because part of the immune system has become overactive and out of control. This leads to cells in the connective tissue producing too much collagen, causing scarring and thickening (fibrosis) of the tissue. There are several different types of scleroderma that can vary in severity. Some types are relatively mild and may eventually improve on their own, while others can lead to severe and life-threatening problems. There\u2019s no cure for scleroderma, but most people with the condition can lead a full, productive life. The symptoms of scleroderma can usually be controlled by a range of different treatments. \u2013 NHS\n\n\u2018I felt excruciating pain, especially when it got cold. I could barely move.\n\n\u2018It was extremely frightening as I had no idea what was going on.\n\n\u2018Looking back, it\u2019s crazy to think how much pain I put up with.\u2019\n\nScleroderma has made Georginas skin tighten and harden, making it difficult for her to fully open her mouth (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\nThe lack of answers in the UK led Georgina to travel to Poland, where her mum was born, to talk to more medical professionals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorgina remembers: \u2018My train of thought was have a few simple tests done, I could then take these results back to my doctor in the UK and be given the medicine needed to fix the issue, then get on with life as normal.\n\n\u2018I was so wrong.\u2019\n\nIn Poland Georgina was told that she had scleroderma, and that the condition had spread internally through her lungs and oesophagus. She need to have chemotherapy every three weeks for the next year.\n\nAt the time she was diagnosed, Georgina had no knowledge of scleroderma, an incurable, debilitating chronic illness that has effects that go far beyond outward appearance.\n\nGeorgina\u2019s fingers are often covered with excruciatingly painful ulcers (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s my lungs that were affected first and most of my digestive system including my oesophagus and then my bowel,\u2019 she says. \u2018As well as my body on the outside being affected which involves skin tightening and hardening to my face, arms and legs, I have oint stiffness, pain through out my body, causing reduced and restricted mobility, muscle weakness and chronic fatigue.\u2019\n\nThe hardening and tightening of the skin around Georgina\u2019s face often means she\u2019s unable to open her mouth widely enough to eat, while the inflammation, pain, and hardening of her lungs and throat make breathing an immense struggle.\n\nHer hands and wrists are in constant pain, making it difficult to use them day-to-day, and physical contact can be excruciating.\n\n\u2018I tend to use my elbows to push myself up but the constant friction of doing this can cause ulcers to develop on my elbows, which then makes things harder and more painful,\u2019 Georgina says.\n\nGeorgina\u2019s skin is so tight she struggles to close her hand into a fist (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\n\u2018Brushing my teeth is difficult. I find it hard just holding the toothbrush because of the stiffness in my hands. Small things like unscrewing the toothpaste lid are tricky, and because my mouth can not open wide anymore due to tightening of the skin and muscles I have to use a baby toothbrush just to be able to get the toothbrush inside my mouth. Getting to the back teeth is very difficult and always painful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Turning taps is really difficult and can be extremely painful on my fingers, especially when I have flare ups of digital ulcers, joint pain and overall sensitivity to the skin.\n\n\u2018The tiniest knock is agony \u2013 so that is literally doing most things throughout the day.\n\n\u2018Scleroderma has affected my oesophagus, so the muscles in my throat no longer work efficiently, meaning when I eat food can get stuck in my throat very easily. I suffer from a lot of vomiting when certain foods don\u2019t go down properly.\u2019\n\nHer illness has visible symptoms, \u2013 including sore, red skin, swelling and stretching of the face, and blistered hands that she cannot close into a fist \u2013 which means she sometimes receives looks and negative comments.\n\nGeorgina sometimes needs to use a wheelchair to get around (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\nOf course, other parts of her illness are invisible, and so her disability is often dismissed.\n\nGeorgina sometimes needs to use a wheelchair or walking stick, but not always. Scleroderma also affects her bowels, meaning she needs to use disabled toilets, and receives judgement from people who don\u2019t think she \u2018looks\u2019 unwell.\n\nGeorgina believes that scleroderma isn\u2019t commonly understood, and hopes that by speaking openly about her story she\u2019ll change things for others struggling.\n\n\u2018When I was diagnosed I felt very overwhelmed,\u2019 she says. \u2018I couldn\u2019t really process the information to begin with.\n\n\u2018Being told I had an incurable, life changing condition was something I never thought I\u2019d hear. I was very much in denial and angry to begin with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018To look at me you can barely see that anything is wrong. This was something I found really hard to come to terms with at the start and I still get frustrated at times because it almost feels like I live in chronic illness limbo. I don\u2019t fit into what is mostly thought of as \u2018disabled\u2019.\n\nGeorgina doing a lung function (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\n\u2018It can be difficult to get across how an illness that isn\u2019t immediately visible can so debilitating.\n\n\u2018There have been a few times were I\u2019ve had to deal with dirty looks for parking in a disabled parking space using my blue badge.\n\n\u2018Unless I have my walking stick or wheelchair I look like I\u2019m taking advantage, when I\u2019m honestly not.\u2019\n\nFollowing a year of chemotherapy, Georgina has had to undergo multiple treatments to reduce the symptoms of diffuse systemic scleroderma.\n\nShe currently has regular infusions of Iloprost, a drug that relaxes arteries and improve blood pressure, and takes daily suppressant drugs, steroids, painkillers, and medication for severe acid reflux.\n\nThe 34-year-old also needs to go into hospital for regular checkups, scans, and lung function tests, as well as managing flareups when they occur.\n\nGeorgina is grateful to have an incredibly supportive family (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while treatments can reduce symptoms and Georgina\u2019s levels of pains can change day-by-day, there is no cure for scleroderma \u2013 it\u2019s a chronic condition that causes her constant pain.\n\nGeorgina tries to stay positive and keep going with the treatments that seem to help.\n\n\u2018With my skin getting tighter and tighter we had to stretch everything out again and get me walking properly again,\u2019 she explains. \u2018These sessions were complete agony but worth it in the long run. My skin felt like it was shrinking and hugely affected my mobility.\n\n\u2018Now I have weekly deep tissue massages. The tension and stiffness can change from week to week but it always helps and with the increased blood flow it really helps to keep my skin as supple as possible.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m extremely lucky to have such a strong support network around me. My family and friends have always been amazing and have never made me feel self conscious about anything when I\u2019m with them. They make sure I never miss out on anything and will think of ways to adapt so I can join in.\n\nShe\u2019s now sharing her experiences with scleroderma on Instagram to raise awareness of the rare condition (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the little things that I get most self conscious about \u2013 like my hands, with them being less mobile and if I\u2019m on my own I get an inner panic whenever I need to handle money, for example. It\u2019s something so simple but when I get to the till I always have a inner panic, I struggle picking out coins from my purse and I\u2019ll most likely drop something and struggle picking it up again.\n\n\u2018My grip is terrible because I can\u2019t completely close my hand into a fist so things just drop out of my hands all the time. Being extra slow with packing I panic that people are watching. I don\u2019t even look at anyone in the queue because I feel embarrassed.\n\n\u2018I can get very self conscious in the supermarket- unable to pick tins, bottles because of my grip and stuff hands. I am unable to carry too much as I physically don\u2019t have the strength. Just very short trips to the shop will completely exhausted me.\n\n\u2018Then there\u2019s technology \u2013 I can\u2019t use touch screen like everyone else. It\u2019s meant to make life easier\u2026 well, not for someone with scleroderma The curved fingers don\u2019t help. Also because of the ulcers I get on my finger joints using my knuckles can be extremely painful.\n\n\u2018I try to push through my insecurities and tell myself it\u2019s what going on in my head that\u2019s the toughest part I feel really self conscious, especially when eating is involved. I\u2019m constantly panicking something might not go down right and will get stuck or that I look strange because I can\u2019t open my mouth normally.\u2019\n\nGeorgina with her dog, Moses (Picture: Georgina Pantano)\n\n\u2018Meeting new people sometimes makes me feel quite anxious, the question \u2013 \u2018so what do you do?\u2019\n\n\u2018At the beginning I would get myself so worked up about this because my life was no longer \u2018normal\u2019, unable to work because of an invisible illness but looked absolutely fine.\u2019\n\nGeorgina now shares her experiences of scleroderma on Instagram in an attempt to raise awareness of the rarely discussed condition and provide support to others suffering.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m happy to talk about living with scleroderma to whoever wants to listen,\u2019 she tells us. \u2018Raising awareness is so important to help improve understanding.\n\n\u2018You can never judge a book by its cover, and living with this illness has definitely made me more compassionate and empathetic towards others.\n\n\u2018I hope being more open and honest can help spread that compassion and understanding.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d be lying if I said this hasn\u2019t been a tough journey mentally. I\u2019ve definitely had my ups and downs and times I\u2019ve been so low, feeling so physically and mentally exhausted I just wanted to give up.\n\n\u2018I decided this illness would not beat me. I\u2019ve been determined to keep as strong and positive as I possibly can.\u2019\n\nMORE: Hate crimes against disabled people are growing and abusers are getting away with it\n\nMORE: How I Save: The disabled marketing assistant earning \u00a318,500 a year and living in London\n\nMORE: Bleeding during pregnancy: How much is normal?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Georgina Pantano has diffuse systemic scleroderma, that causes her skin to harden and tighten and affects her internal organs.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/georgina-pantano-scleroderma_1570890714.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
