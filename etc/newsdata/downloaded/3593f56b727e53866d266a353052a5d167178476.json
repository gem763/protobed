If the chancellor does not provide the committee with an update, we can only assume that the existing analysis stands.\"\n\nPrevious Treasury forecasts showed a smaller economy from a basic free trade agreement.", "description": "Governor of the Bank of England says deal takes away the threat of a 'disorderly' Brexit.", "authors": ["Faisal Islam", "Economics Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rghz6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
