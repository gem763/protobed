However those born in 1970 earned 19% more than their peers who did not go to university. This suggests the \"graduate premium\" fell by eight percentage points during this period.", "description": "The value of a university education has halved in the past 20 years, new research has shown, as critics claim that degrees have become \u2018disqualifications\u2019.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social Affairs Editor", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson", "Stewart Jackson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000211739008-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplGOf-dgG3z4gg9owgQTXAsIcagKWDTsYii0WZbrxoU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
