One person was injured.\n\nAs rain poured down on the capital, others sought shelter in an iconic abandoned cinema on the edge of the square nicknamed \u201cthe Egg\u201d.\n\nThe British embassy in Beirut joined the United States in urging Lebanese leaders to respond to the \u201clegitimate\u201d frustrations of citizens.\n\nIn his speech, Aoun said he respected the right of protesters to speak up but urged them to open key roads that they have blocked.\n\nAmnesty International said demonstrators peacefully cutting off roads was a legitimate form of protest and warned the army against dispersing them by force.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Our basic rights\u2019 \u2013\n\nDemonstrators again closed thoroughfares around the capital early Thursday, AFP correspondents and Lebanese media reported.\n\nSitting on the pavement of a major east-west artery, a 30-year-old said he had been protesting since the first day.\n\n\u201cPeople think we\u2019re playing but we\u2019re actually asking for our most basic rights: water, food, electricity, healthcare, pensions, medicine, schooling,\u201d he said.\n\nBanks, schools and universities remained closed.\n\nThe president also echoed calls to stamp out graft in Lebanon, which ranked 138 out of 180 countries in Transparency International\u2019s 2018 corruption index.\n\n\u201cEvery person who stole public money should be held accountable but it is important his sect doesn\u2019t defend him blindly,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a state prosecutor pressed charges against former prime minister Najib Mikati over allegations he wrongly received millions of dollars in subsidised housing loans, charges he denies.\n\nThe timing of the move was seen by some as a nod to protesters.\n\nOn Wednesday, the army deployed in the streets, sparking fears of clashes.\n\nBut protesters faced the troops with chants of \u201cpeaceful, peaceful\u201d and a video of one soldier seemingly in tears was shared widely online.\n\nIn the southern Shiite-majority city of Nabatieh, police however tried to disperse protesters by force, leaving several injured, the National News Agency said.\n\nLocal media reported that five local council members had quit in protest.\n\nDemonstrators returned to protest in the city Thursday, some taking part in a traditional dabkeh dance.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Lebanon's president offered Thursday to meet the protesters whose week-old mobilisation to demand a complete overhaul of the political system has brought the country to a standstill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lebanon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
