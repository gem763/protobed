Now Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican and former White House hopeful, has been making waves in his own party instead.\n\nHe is openly critical of President Trump in personal statements, in a damning op-ed for The Washington Post before he even took office, and Twitter of course \u2014 prompting some analysts to wonder whether Mr. Romney was again striking a presidential posture.\n\nWell, that\u2019s a thought. Mr. Romney has maintained an active campaign website ever since he lost the 2012 presidential election to President Obama. His campaign did develop a site in the event of Mr. Romney\u2019s victory that year. \u201cSmaller, simpler, smarter. Believe in America,\u201d the official motto read at the \u201cOffice of the President-Elect.\u201d The site was deactivated.\n\nSo. Is Mr. Romney ready to try a presidential run? Some question the possibility.\n\n\u201cAccording to people close to Romney, he\u2019s firmly decided against primarying Trump, an enterprise he believes to be a sure loser given Trump\u2019s enduring GOP support. Romney has also told people that, as an unsuccessful two-time presidential candidate, he\u2019s the wrong person to take on Trump,\u201d writes Vanity Fair correspondent Gabriel Sherman. \u201cInstead, a Romney adviser told me that Romney believes he has more potential power as a senator who will decide Trump\u2019s fate in an impeachment trial.\u201d\n\nThere are some noble frills.\n\n\u201cHe could have tremendous influence in the impeachment process as the lone voice of conscience in the Republican caucus,\u201d the adviser told Mr. Sherman.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Romney has been busy behind the scenes, privately reaching out to key players in what Mr. Sherman deems the \u201cRepublican resistance.\u201d Those key players certainly involve his GOP peers.\n\n\u201cRomney is the one guy who could bring along Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Ben Sasse. Romney is the pressure point in the impeachment process. That\u2019s why the things he\u2019s saying are freaking Republicans out,\u201d a source who has been briefed on this matter told Mr. Sherman.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
