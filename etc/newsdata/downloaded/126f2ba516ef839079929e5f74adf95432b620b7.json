Bond yields, the interest rate return on the sovereign debt of eurozone members, subsided.\n\nThis led the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman to describe Draghi as \u2018arguably the greatest central banker of modern times\u2019.\n\nGermany battles slump Hopes that Germany will emerge from recession in the run up to Christmas have suffered a setback as it registered the first fall in employment for six years. The job losses, while small, are concentrated in manufacturing, where staffing numbers registered their biggest drop in almost a decade. The country\u2019s Bundesbank this week said Germany had tumbled into recession in the third quarter amid global trade tensions, disruption in the car industry and uncertainty around Brexit. The latest snapshot of Europe\u2019s biggest economy, published yesterday, indicates it has continued to shrink as its manufacturing and services industries have misfired.\n\nDoubtlessly former Fed chairmen Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke \u2013 the latter steered the world clear of the 2008-09 financial crisis \u2013 might dispute that.\n\nBut there is no denying that the euro area and it institutions, which Draghi hands over to former IMF chief Christine Lagarde at the end of the month, are more solid, durable and able to withstand shocks than they were when he took command in 2011.\n\nThat is not to say that the single currency area is an unalloyed triumph. It is anything but as the latest data from the eurozone, showing a weak start to the final quarter of 2019, reveals.\n\nIndeed, the eurozone being inherited by Lagarde has come to look a little like Japan during its lost decades in the latter part of the 20th century and early part of the 21st century.\n\nThe region is caught in a trap where a combination of negative interest rates and bond buying, worth \u20ac4.65 trillion, together with direct short-term assistance to wobbling banks in Greece, Italy and elsewhere, has just been enough to prevent Europe from slump.\n\nBut it is an uphill struggle and the ECB has so far failed to bring inflation back to its 2 per cent target. Although for the moment deflation has been avoided, the inflation rate hovers closer to 1 per cent.\n\nOne of Draghi\u2019s last rolls of the dice before he left office was to go deeper into negative interest rates on the grounds that it encourages commerce and citizens to spend rather than leave money in the bank where its value deteriorates.\n\nSuccessor: Draghi's replacement Christine Lagarde inherits a Eurozone teetering on the brink of recession\n\nHis CV illustrates why there is no substitute for frontline experience when it comes to central banking.\n\nThat is a lesson which Chancellor Sajid Javid and Downing Street might want to contemplate as a successor is chosen to Mark Carney, who is due to step down as governor of the Bank of England on January 31, 2020 after two Brexit-related extensions to his tenure.\n\nAs is the case with Carney and Bill Dudley, former president of the New York Fed, a stint at Goldman Sachs also exposed Draghi to the raw, bonus driven capitalism of the investment banks.\n\nThroughout his period at the ECB he has been in a running battle with German members of the interest rate-setting ECB council as well as the German federal courts, which have challenged the use of ECB funds for rescue operations for the euro area and the banks.\n\nDraghi managed to extend the ECB\u2019s powers, both as a lender of last resort to the financial system and as regulator of the most significant banks.\n\nBut the lack of common fiscal policy across the euro area\u2019s 17 members, together with feeble transfers from wealthy to poorer states, has condemned Greece, Spain and Italy to high unemployment levels and undermined social cohesion.\n\nThese dangers arose in spite of Draghi\u2019s titanic struggle to secure fundamental change.", "description": "There is no denying that the euro area and its institutions, which Mario Draghi hands over to Christine Lagarde at the end of the month, are more solid than they were when he took command.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
