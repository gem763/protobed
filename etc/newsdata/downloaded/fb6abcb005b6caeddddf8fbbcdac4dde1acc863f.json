Pelosi told reporters the president had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and said \u201cwe have to pray for his health.\u201d\n\nLater on Wednesday, Trump tweeted a photo of Pelosi chastising him at the meeting, calling it \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d is not what a lot of people saw in the photo. Instead, they saw a lone woman standing up to a roomful of men, giving them a piece of her mind. Soon, #PelosiOwnsTrump was trending on Twitter. The House speaker made the photo her Twitter cover image.\n\nAsked about the photo at a press conference on Thursday, Pelosi said that during the meeting in question, she\u2019d voiced concerns about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s influence over Trump and his foreign policy. At the moment the photo was taken, she said, \u201cI was probably saying, all roads lead to Putin.\u201d\n\nPelosi on \"meltdown\" pic Trump posted of their meeting: \"I think I was excusing myself from the room.\"\n\n\n\nSays she shared concerns \"about all roads leading to Putin, & if POTUS is saying, 'I said during the campaign I was going to take the troops home,' then is home Saudi Arabia?\" pic.twitter.com/8gxorAf5Uh \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 17, 2019\n\nOf course, the photo may have played well with Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters. But the fact that Pelosi was able to use it so easily to her advantage is yet more evidence of a weakness with Trump\u2019s approach \u2014 a lot of his alpha-male bullying tactics just don\u2019t work very well on women. Unable to impugn their masculinity, Trump usually goes for attacks on their appearance or implying that they\u2019re mentally ill. But women who have managed to attain positions of power in American society are used to these tactics \u2014 and, as Pelosi showed, they\u2019re often more than capable of using Trump\u2019s insults to their own advantage.\n\nTrump tried to make \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d look bad. It backfired.\n\nTrump met with Pelosi and other Democratic leaders Wednesday to talk about the situation in Syria, where the president\u2019s decision to withdraw troops has left key US allies vulnerable to attack by Turkish forces, and sparked criticism among Democrats and Republicans alike, as Vox\u2019s Ella Nilsen and Li Zhou explain.\n\nThe meeting quickly became contentious, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that Democrats walked out after Trump called Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pray for the president all the time and I tell him that,\u201d Pelosi said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon, after the meeting. \u201cI pray for his safety and that of his family. Now we have to pray for his health, because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted the photo that evening, presumably to show that it was Pelosi, not him, who had a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\nBut for a lot of people, the photo instead made Pelosi look brave and strong \u2014 \u201cstanding up and speaking up,\u201d as Republican strategist Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas put it, to Trump and the other men at the table.\n\nI hope this picture of Nancy Pelosi, the sole woman at the table, standing-up and speaking-up, inspires other bad-ass women to run for office. pic.twitter.com/MQoIvCo4NJ \u2014 Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas (@ananavarro) October 17, 2019\n\nThe term \u201cbadass\u201d came up a lot.\n\nShe stood up to the bully.\n\nShe's a bad ass. #PelosiOwnsTrump pic.twitter.com/7EyIzoYnbD \u2014 Lydia Guzman (@LydiaGuzman) October 17, 2019\n\nDemocratic strategist Christine Pelosi, the speaker\u2019s daughter, noted that she\u2019d seen this side of her mom before.\n\nLooks like she owned you on #NationalBossDay. Been there. Don\u2019t mess with mama! https://t.co/8unyy930Dj \u2014 Christine Pelosi (@sfpelosi) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd the speaker made clear what she thought of the photo when she made it her Twitter cover image.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet was the latest example of a pattern when it comes to powerful women\n\nThe president\u2019s attempt to shame Pelosi likely worked among his base. But for most other Americans, it backfired. That should come as no surprise, given Trump\u2019s track record with powerful women.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, Trump\u2019s strategy in confrontations with men is often to question their masculinity \u2014 he called Marco Rubio \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and made fun of Jeb Bush\u2019s supposedly \u201clow energy.\u201d It\u2019s a style he\u2019s likely developed in a long career in male-dominated spaces, from the military academy where he went to school to the heavily male real estate development business to the Hollywood sets where he bragged about being able to grab women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d\n\nBut that strategy doesn\u2019t work on women, so Trump usually tries to invade their personal space, insult their appearance, or, as in the case of \u201cNervous Nancy,\u201d insinuate that they are mentally ill or unstable. Any woman who\u2019s gotten to where Pelosi is now, though, has had to put up with being called \u201ccrazy\u201d a time or two. Except with people already primed to applaud Trump\u2019s misogyny, the strategy is doomed to fail.\n\nOf course, Trump still won the 2016 election. But it wasn\u2019t because of his ability to square off with Hillary Clinton in one-on-one confrontation \u2014 most Americans thought she won the debates. And while Pelosi has taken plenty of criticism for her handling of Trump over the years, especially around impeachment, Trump\u2019s latest attempt to paint her as having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d only increased her support.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder as the country enters the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries with questions about whether a woman can beat Trump still circulating among the media and the public: Most of Trump\u2019s tactics were honed over a lifetime of sparring and posturing with men. When he goes up against a woman instead, he\u2019s out of his element \u2014 and it shows.", "description": "President Trump tried to shame Speaker Nancy Pelosi by tweeting a photo of their meeting.
