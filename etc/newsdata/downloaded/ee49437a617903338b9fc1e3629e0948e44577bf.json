If the motion had succeeded, parliament would have adjourned at the end of the day on Thursday and resumed next Thursday.\n\nIn normal times, parliament adjourns to allow MPs to attend their party\u2019s conferences, but opposition parties have argued that \u201cparliamentary democracy and scrutiny during the current constitutional crisis\u201d should take precedence.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday, Jeremy Corbyn said he would vote against any attempt by the government to introduce a new recess. \u201cI don\u2019t see why Boris Johnson and his team should be able to run away from accountability yet again,\u201d he said.\n\nA senior Tory source said the conference would go ahead anyway, but acknowledged it may have to be \u201cscaled back\u201d in places if MPs had to remain at Westminster.\n\nFollowing the vote, the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, announced non-controversial business for when the house sits on Monday and Tuesday next week. The domestic abuse bill, which has cross-party support and risked being dropped when parliament was prorogued, will be debated on Wednesday.\n\nBoris Johnson is due to give his keynote conference speech on Wednesday, but it is expected to be rescheduled as it would clash with prime minister\u2019s questions.\n\nLabour MPs in the north-west had expressed concern that refusing to allow the Conservative party conference to take place would hit Manchester\u2019s economy. Marketing Manchester has estimated that the event, which attracts thousands of delegates, is worth about \u00a332m to the local economy.\n\nLucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, raised the issue on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nLucy Powell MP (@LucyMPowell) Just been in a pub in Manchester City Centre (for a meeting!). They have huge booking for Tory conference next week and have ordered all the food. One consequence of today might be adverse impact on businesses in Manchester due to no conference next week.\n\nShe added: \u201cObviously fundamentally disagree with their policies and see every day the damage they\u2019ve caused but that doesn\u2019t mean to say I can\u2019t be concerned by a very late cancellation that will have a big impact on people\u2019s livelihoods in the city.\u201d", "description": "Tory source says conference will still go ahead but may be scaled back", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7379b270c9115658356c19945b77d2526bb3811f/738_96_1697_1019/master/1697.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=caab9b646de007b9056945acffca66e9", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
