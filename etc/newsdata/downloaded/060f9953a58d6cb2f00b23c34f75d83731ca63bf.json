I shouldn't say that. But it is just not right.\"\n\nHe defended his pay saying it was not \"outrageous\" compared with other bosses in the FTSE 250 index, which Thomas Cook exited last December. He also said pay-packages had been set by the firm's remuneration committee and approved by shareholders.\n\n'Uncertainty grew'\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate interview with The Sunday Times, Mr Fankhauser, a Swiss national, appeared to blame a group of banks for not supporting a bail-out plan for Thomas Cook.\n\nHe said if bondholders and a syndicate of 17 banks - including Barclays, Morgan Stanley, DNB, UniCredit, Credit Suisse, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland - had acted faster, then Thomas Cook would still be trading.\n\nImage copyright Sopa/Getty\n\n\"The longer the talks dragged on, the more uncertainty grew, increasing the likelihood of a liquidity squeeze,\" Mr Fankhauser told the newspaper.\n\n\"Had we been quicker, we might not be in the situation we are now.\"\n\nThomas Cook had secured a \u00a3900m rescue deal led by its largest shareholder Chinese firm Fosun in August, but a recent demand from its banks to raise a further \u00a3200m in contingency funding put the deal in doubt.\n\nMr Fankhauser accused the banks and bondholders of \"trading for every point\" during what were to be ultimately-unsuccessful funding talks.\n\nHe also told the paper: \"I think it would be very difficult for me to find another job in the UK.\"", "description": "Peter Fankhauser denies 'fat cat' label and says banks played a role in the travel firm's downfall.", "authors": ["Bill Wilson", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1520D/production/_109014568_mediaitem109014566.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
