Katie Porter (D-Calif.) is in a vulnerable position, having flipped a Republican seat in Orange County, and acknowledges the political risks of being pro-impeachment. | Mario Tama/Getty Images 2020 elections \u2018You are helping him\u2019: Vulnerable Democrats grilled on impeachment Lawmakers are being confronted at town halls by voters \u2014 not with activist organizations \u2014 who boast deep knowledge of Mueller's probe.\n\nIRVINE, Calif. \u2014 Democrats hoping to avoid clashes over impeachment when they left Washington this summer are being confronted with a difficult reality at sometimes hostile town hall events.\n\nVoters across the country \u2014 from California to Pennsylvania to Massachusetts \u2014 grilled House Democrats on the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump at a series of events this month, regardless of whether they support or oppose the drastic measure.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe very first question Rep. Katie Porter received at a town hall here, for example, was where she stood on impeaching Trump.\n\nTo rousing applause, the vulnerable California Democrat told the crowd that she favors impeachment \u2014 even though some worry it would play into the president\u2019s hands. Porter, who flipped a Republican seat in what is becoming a more liberal Orange County, also acknowledged the political dangers of her pro-impeachment stance.\n\n\u201cPeople said, \u2018Well, this might be risky, you might not get reelected,\u2019\u201d Porter said. \u201cI said, \u2018I am here to do what\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d\n\nHer response underscores the quandary facing House Democrats \u2014 especially so-called front-line members whom the national party believes are its most vulnerable in 2020. Many progressive voters want Democratic leaders to move forward with impeachment immediately, the politics of it be damned, because ethics demand it; others are hammering their representatives over the possibility that impeachment would boost Trump\u2019s reelection prospects because he would claim vindication after being acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf the only times I got out of bed were days I thought something I vote on would pass the Senate, I would have bedsores,\u201d Porter quipped.\n\nDemocrats won the majority in the House because they flipped dozens of Republican-held seats, including all four in Orange County, with candidates who billed themselves as moderates. But many of those same Democrats have come out for impeachment, and all of the potentially perilous political consequences that come with it.\n\nIt\u2019s a question freshman Rep. Harley Rouda has also grappled with. Rouda, another Orange County Democrat, is high on Republicans\u2019 target list as they aim to retake the majority in 2020 \u2014 but he, too, backs an impeachment inquiry, despite fears among many Democrats that taking such a position in a swing district is a political death knell.\n\n\u201cNone of the calculus included, \u2018What does this mean to me personally from a political standpoint?\u2019\u201d Rouda said in an interview in Laguna Beach, where he lives. \u201c\u2018Does this help me or hurt me in my chances of getting reelected?\u2019 never crossed my mind once.\u201d\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch, who opposes impeachment because he fears it will help Trump, faced a hostile crowd of around 200 advocates, activists and constituents who shouted him down as he delivered impassioned rejections of their calls for impeachment.\n\nLynch, who has served in the House for nearly two decades, faces a different predicament than his fellow moderates in swing districts. The Massachusetts Democrat doesn't fear Republican opponents; he has progressive primary challengers as his already-blue Boston suburbs district is being yanked to the left.\n\n\u201cYou are going to give Donald Trump another four years by doing that. You are helping him. You are helping him get another four years,\u201d Lynch fired back at his constituents, raising his voice as the restive audience shouted at him. \u201cI want Donald Trump removed from office and you\u2019re going to give him another four years. That\u2019s what I know. That\u2019s what I know in my heart.\u201d\n\nMany of the pro-impeachment voters turning out at town halls didn\u2019t appear to be part of organized efforts, even as progressive groups like Impeach Now and Indivisible have ramped up their \u201cImpeachment August\u201d campaign. There were few, if any, matching T-shirts, poster-board signs or coordinated chants.\n\nInstead, people lined up at the microphones eager to discuss specifics of Trump\u2019s actions as outlined in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report and the House\u2019s lawsuits \u2014 a kind of detailed knowledge and energy that suggests pro-impeachment sentiment is more deep-rooted than simply an antagonistic anti-Trump movement and could be impossible for Democrats to ignore long term.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/598/1155968404_6063701360001_6063699303001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nSeveral people were so versed in the House\u2019s work that they at times challenged their own members about the legal merits of an impeachment \u201cinquiry,\u201d a nuanced argument that is usually heard in the hallways of Congress rather than a suburban community center. They praised House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) by name, and name-dropped witnesses like former White House counsel Don McGahn, who was mentioned multiple times in Mueller\u2019s 448-page report.\n\nThe issue also resurfaced in a Democratic Caucus call this month, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated her cautious view on the subject.\n\n\u201cThe public isn\u2019t there on impeachment. It\u2019s your voice and constituency, but give me the leverage I need to make sure that we\u2019re ready and it is as strong as it can be,\u201d Pelosi told House Democrats in the conference call last week, according to an aide.\n\n\u201cThe equities we have to weigh are our responsibility to protect and defend the Constitution and to be unifying and not dividing. But if and when we act, people will know he gave us no choice,\u201d Pelosi added, a reference to Trump\u2019s stonewalling of myriad congressional investigations. \u201cIf he cannot respect the Constitution, we\u2019ll have to deal with that. It\u2019s about patriotism, not partisanship.\u201d\n\nBut liberal voters across the country, who flocked to town halls this month, say that politics is the exact reason Democratic leaders aren\u2019t acting on impeachment.\n\nIn a conservative suburb of Pittsburgh, one man recited lines from the Mueller report as he pressed vulnerable freshman Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) on his opposition to impeachment.\n\n\u201cI happen to believe, having read the Mueller report \u2014 back to front, back again \u2014 there are a lot of questions we still need to know the answers to,\u201d Lamb, a former federal prosecutor, said during the event.\n\nIn a packed City Council room in Verona, N.J., Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill faced dozens of people clamoring for impeachment and, at times, interrupting her to make their point.\n\n\u201cIf we let him get away with this, my fear is, there will not be a Constitution,\u201d one woman told Sherrill, sparking applause.\n\nBut Sherrill, who is also a former federal prosecutor, said Democrats don\u2019t yet have enough evidence to bring an impeachment case against Trump \u2014 a charge that a majority of her Democratic colleagues have rejected.\n\n\u201cIf we don't make a strong enough case to the American people \u2014 and right now, I don\u2019t think we can do that without more \u2014 the president will be acquitted, and we will now have two branches of our government who have said that his behavior is acceptable,\u201d Sherrill said as the room quieted, adding that she would support impeachment if Trump defies a court order.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill, a former federal prosecutor, has also faced hostility after saying she doesn't believe there is enough evidence to impeach. | Mary Altaffer/AP Photo\n\nYet this moved some members of the audience to accuse her of playing politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fight worth fighting. If you lose, you lose, but at least you made the fight,\u201d one man said as Sherrill turned to other questions. Another woman chimed in with a warning: \u201cDon\u2019t be last to speak up. You\u2019ll be challenged.\u201d\n\nRep. Gil Cisneros, a Democrat who also flipped a GOP-held seat in Orange County and parts of Los Angeles, supports the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s efforts to get its hands on key documents and secure witness testimony via the various court battles wading their way through the federal judiciary. But he said the House needs Mueller\u2019s grand jury information and testimony from McGahn and other former top White House aides before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t hold an impeachment hearing with just simply the Mueller report. We need the information behind the Mueller report, which the administration is not giving us, which is why we\u2019re fighting that in court right now,\u201d Cisneros said in an interview in Buena Park.\n\nIn the beachside city of Del Mar, outside San Diego, Rep. Mike Levin, another vulnerable Orange County Democrat, defended his support for an impeachment inquiry from a voter who pressed him on the political implications: \u201cWhy give [Trump] this gift?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that the politics on this are divided,\u201d Levin told the man. \u201cBut I also know, with two young children, that eventually I\u2019m going to have to account for what I did or did not do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I would rather be able, in the years ahead, to look back and know that we protected our democracy and that we stood up for what we knew to be right, for what we knew the founders intended for us to do, rather than what we felt may or may not be politically expedient,\u201d Levin said as voters in the room gave him a standing ovation.\n\nLevin\u2019s district, represented for nearly two decades by former GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, includes the most conservative part of Orange County \u2014 a suburb of Los Angeles that is rapidly shifting Democratic \u2014 and much of San Diego County, which is more liberal. But Democrats still count him as vulnerable, and Levin acknowledged that it won\u2019t be easy to keep his job in 2020. Still, he said, he\u2019s ready to act on impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t take the actions that the Constitution requires, I think we\u2019re going to look back at this period of time and regret it,\u201d Levin told POLITICO after the town hall. \u201cThe Mueller report speaks for itself. Mueller\u2019s testimony speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nKyle Cheney contributed reporting from Massachusetts.\n\n", "description": "Lawmakers are being confronted at town halls by voters \u2014 not with activist organizations \u2014 who boast deep knowledge of Mueller's probe.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d8/ff/205622f94c5e9f7a2ce5ed644aef/190826-katie-porter-gty-773.jpg"}
