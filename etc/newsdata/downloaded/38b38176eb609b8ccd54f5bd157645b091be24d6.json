Seeing how easily these come together \u2014 and how quickly \u2014 will have you making chocolate accents for everything from your party fruit platter to your solo bowl of ice cream. To make them to top Arlene's favourite vanilla cake, use her recipe.\n\nIf you think you can\u2019t make gold-painted sails and medallions in minutes, you just haven\u2019t seen how easy it is. 8:23\n\nChocolate Medallions\n\nA really popular trend in plating food is this sort of \"stamping\" method with pur\u00e9es or sauces. I like to use this same kind of method for making chocolate medallions.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup chocolate chips (white or dark)\n\nTools:\n\nGlass bowl for melting chocolate\n\nRubber spatula, for stirring\n\nSmall glass or jar or coaster with a wide, flat bottom\n\nCookie sheet (or use a baking sheet)\n\nParchment paper cut to size of cookie sheet\n\nEdible glitter/lustre dust, (optional)\n\nEdible paint, paintbrush, (optional)\n\nMelt the chocolate in a glass bowl over a double boiler, stir with a rubber spatula, then set it aside to cool a little; when it's around body temperature, it will behave well, so stir and touch your hand to the outside to gauge the temperature before proceeding.\n\nPlace a small dollop of chocolate on each corner of the cookie sheet before laying the parchment paper on top, to secure it in place. Then place dollops of chocolate onto the top of the parchment paper, leaving some room for spreading. Place the flat glass bottom on top of each dollop and lift it up to create your textured medallion; the more texture, the better. If the melted chocolate sets up too quickly in the bowl, warm it up again and proceed.\n\nSet the medallions aside to cool and set, then peel them off and add to the top of a tart, cup of mousse or around a cake. Or, decorate them with edible glitter or lustre dusts available at baking shops, or paint them with edible paint (see video for techniques).\n\nMarbled shapes\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup chocolate candy melts\n\n\u00bd cup white candy melts\n\nTools:\n\n2 glass bowls (1 for each colour)\n\n2 small rubber spatulas for stirring chocolate\n\n1 extra large plastic freezer bag\n\nRolling pin or wide spatula\n\nDiamond shaped cookie cutters\n\nPlace each colour of candy melts in separate glass bowls and warm in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time, giving them each a stir with separate small spatulas, until smooth. Alternatively, warm gently over a double boiler on the stove top.\n\nCut the freezer bag down the sides (only) and open it up like a book \u2014 place it on a cookie sheet or on a smooth counter. Take a generous scoop of the chocolate melted candy and spread it to about a \u215b\" thickness on one half of the plastic. Don't go all the way to the edge as you'll be pressing this out a little more. Drizzle the white melted candy randomly over top.\n\nTake the other half of your freezer bag and fold it back over the candy. Smooth it out with a rolling pin, wide spatula (or even your hand). Aim for the thickness of a credit card \u2014 a couple of millimetres.\n\nPress the cookie cutter down firmly onto the plastic; wiggle it while pressing down to the other side. (When you lift it up, you should see the cookie sheet or countertop through the outline of the cutter.) Continue to cut out as many diamonds as you would like. Set aside to set up: they will set up quickly in the fridge, or in about 15 minutes on the counter at room temperature.\n\nWhen the shapes are set, peel back the top piece of plastic, then push from underneath with your hand to pop the shapes out. Add the decorations to you cake, pastry or pudding.\n\nChocolate sails\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup chocolate chips or candy melts\n\nTools:\n\nGlass bowl for melting chocolate\n\nRubber spatula, for stirring\n\n1 clear acetate sheet (available at art and crafts stores)\n\nOffset spatula to spread chocolate\n\nLarge and small drinking glasses to place the chocolate in to set\n\nMelt the chocolate in a glass bowl over a double boiler, stir with a rubber spatula, then set it aside to cool a little.\n\nCut out simple leaf shapes (oblong shapes that are pointed at each end) from the acetate and place them on a cookie sheet. Spoon a little chocolate onto the cutouts and smooth the chocolate out to the edges (beyond the edges is fine) with the offset spatula.\n\nLift out the covered shapes, and lay them, curled and plain-side down, inside the glasses (one per glass). Allow them to set and take on the curve of the glass, which will take about 15 minutes at room temperature or five minutes in the fridge. When set, slide them out from the glasses and peel off the acetate.\n\nYou will be left glossy, curled chocolate 'sails' which you can use as they are to decorate a cake. If you'd like, feel free to paint the sails with edible food sprays or dust with edible glitter.", "description": "If you think you can\u2019t make gold-painted sails and medallions in minutes, you just haven\u2019t seen how easy it is.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5335952.1572031153!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/chocolatetechniques.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
