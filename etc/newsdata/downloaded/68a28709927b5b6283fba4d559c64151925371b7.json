Biden, an accusation the president denies vigorously.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control took the action against the Russian company for \u201cits attempts to subvert American democratic processes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFree and fair elections are the cornerstone of American democracy, and we will use our authorities against anyone seeking to undermine our processes and subversively influence voters,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThis Administration will work tirelessly to safeguard our electoral process, and will aggressively pursue any other foreign actor that attempts to interfere in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nA U.S. grand jury indicted 13 Russian individuals and 3 Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency, in February 2018 on charges of trying to interfere \u201cwith U.S. elections and political processes.\u201d\n\nFacebook announced in July 2018 that it shut down several pages and accounts related to \u201cbad actors\u201d with activity profiles similar to the IRA.\n\nTreasury said there was \u201cno indication that foreign actors were able to compromise election infrastructure that would have prevented voting, changed vote counts, or disrupted the tallying of votes\u201d in 2018.\n\nBut Treasury said the IRA used \u201cfictitious personas on social media and disseminated false information in an effort to attempt to influence the 2018 U.S. midterm elections and try to undermine faith in U.S. democratic institutions.\u201d\n\nIt said the IRA \u201cconducted a variety of activities that were part of a broad campaign to try to influence the U.S. political system. For example, as of October 2018, the Internet Research Agency released a staged video filmed by one of their employees that claimed they were seeking to influence and interfere in the 2018 midterms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn November 2018, the Internet Research Agency posted a statement on a website titled the \u2018Internet Research Agency American Division\u2019 claiming that the organization sought to discredit candidates it deemed hostile to Russia and that they were utilizing social media to further its campaign,\u201d Treasury said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
