REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google will stop showing news snippets from European publishers on search results for its French users, complying with a new European copyright law, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nThe change means French users will only see the headlines and not the first few lines or a thumbnail image for news content unless European publishers specifically request to show previews, the company said. (bit.ly/2l7a3YO)\n\nThousands of European publishers are expected to be affected by the changes, but French publishers will be the most hit.\n\nThe move may impact publishers\u2019 revenue stream as visibility on Google drives traffic to their websites, potentially boosting advertising and subscriptions.\n\nSpain and Germany in recent years tried to force Google to pay publishers for taking snippets of their news articles, but that backfired after Google News pulled out from Spain and traffic of German publisher Axel Springer plunged after it sought to block the search engine.\n\nFrance is the only EU country so far to implement the bloc\u2019s far-reaching copyright reforms, which were adopted earlier this year. The countries have a year or so to follow suit.", "description": "Alphabet Inc's Google will stop showing news snippets from European publishers on search results for its French users, complying with a new European copyright law, the company said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433736069&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0XC", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
