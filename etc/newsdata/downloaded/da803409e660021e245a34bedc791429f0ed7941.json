Singh talked about some of the reflecting she\u2019s done since, candidly admitting that \u201ccoming out was one of the scariest experiences of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that there is NOTHING more important than living your truth. It\u2019s scary, it\u2019s nerve wrecking and often times it\u2019s painful but ultimately it is worth it. Period. But this post isn\u2019t just about the bright side, it\u2019s about raw truth,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSingh explained that not everyone was supportive of her identity, but that wasn\u2019t the only challenge she was up against.\n\n\u201cEven if I ignore the actions of others and focus on myself, admittedly dealing with the warfare in my mind has been hard,\u201d she wrote. \u201cComing out lifted a weight off my shoulders but at the same time it placed the weight of judgement on my chest. Maybe that\u2019s the culture I was raised in or maybe it\u2019s all in my head but either way for me it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nSingh, who rose to fame for her wildly popular YouTube channel, wrote that she isn\u2019t \u201coblivious\u201d to the fact that some find her sexuality disappointing and said that those reactions have made her \u201cfeel insecure more than once in the past year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy am I sharing all of this? ... Every friend and family member that reached out to me with words of encouragement, you don\u2019t realize how much that meant to me during an uncertain time,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTL;DR life is tough enough for the LGBTQ+ community and various other communities. Kindness, compassion and humanity can go a really long way. Add light, not darkness.\u201d\n\nIn February, Singh came out to the public in a short post on Twitter in which she used emojis to check off the traits \u201cfemale,\u201d \u201ccolored\u201d and \u201cbisexual,\u201d saying that though those elements have \u201cproven to be obstacles from time to time,\u201d she is now \u201cfully embracing them as superpowers.\u201d\n\nMany South Asians expressed how important the revelation was for their community. Writer Afshan D\u2019souza-Lodhi explained to BBC Newsbeat that \u201cin the South Asian community, there\u2019s a hesitancy for women to take ownership of their sexuality in the way Lilly has done.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents have seen [her] videos,\u201d D\u2019souza-Lodhi said. \u201cThey\u2019ve laughed and found it really funny. The videos get shared on Facebook so they have access to that, so for her to come out and to normalize bisexuality in the way she has, allows our parents to have that discussion.\u201d", "description": "Singh reflected on her journey since coming out to her closest friends a year ago.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d727ffd3b00008a65d0c046.jpeg?cache=lytvofpwgi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
