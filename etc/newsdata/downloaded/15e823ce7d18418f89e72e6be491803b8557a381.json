That\u2019s compared to just 43% of Americans.\n\nGallup acknowledges that the differences in support for UBI, defined in the survey as \u201ca government-instituted program that would provide every adult with a specific amount of money each year,\u201d could be related to the U.K.\u2019s and Canada\u2019s traditionally \u201cmore robust social safety nets.\u201d\n\nSupport for UBI was higher among younger people than among their older counterparts, and women across the board were slightly more likely than men to support the policy.\n\nAmerican respondents with more education also showed greater levels of support for UBI than those with less education; meanwhile, respondents in Canada and the U.K. with lower educational attainment were more inclined to support such a policy.\n\nSupport for UBI was higher among younger people than among their older counterparts in all three countries, and women across the board were slightly more likely than men to support the policy.\n\nPaying out $10,000 a year to about 300 million Americans would run a bill of more than $3 trillion a year, according to one estimate published by the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nAs for how such a program would be funded, American UBI supporters were far more willing to pay higher taxes to bankroll it (75% compared to 53% in the U.K. and 49% in Canada). But supporters in all three countries showed similar approval (75% in the U.S., 66% in the U.K. and 67% in Canada) of the notion that companies that gain the most from progress with artificial intelligence should pony up more in taxes to pay for UBI.\n\nPaying out $10,000 a year to about 300 million Americans would run a bill of more than $3 trillion a year, according to one estimate.\n\n\u201cEven in the U.K. and Canada, opinions vary among supporters about paying higher taxes to fund such programs,\u201d the Gallup report\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cUBI programs would likely be more palatable in these countries if their governments were to endorse taxing tech companies to cover the bill.\u201d\n\nThe surveys, conducted between April and June, included responses from 4,394 U.S. adults, 3,049 Canadian adults and 3,208 U.K. adults.\n\nYang, a businessman and former corporate lawyer, has made a $1,000-a-month UBI he calls a \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d a defining feature of his campaign. During last month\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, he announced onstage that he would give $1,000 a month in supporter-donated funds to at least 10 recipients for a year, having already personally funded such payments to families in New Hampshire, Iowa and Florida.\n\nBoosters of UBI, who include Facebook FB, -1.16% CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla TSLA, -0.43% CEO Elon Musk, believe such a program would provide Americans with a safety net and aid automation-displaced workers.\n\nAbout 25% of U.S. jobs have \u201chigh exposure to automation\u201d over the next few decades, according to a Brookings Institute analysis published in January, with more than 70% of their tasks \u201cat risk of substitution.\u201d", "description": "American respondents with more education also showed greater levels of support for UBI than those with less education.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS352_yang_ZG_20190930172344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
