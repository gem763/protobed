The RBA cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent on Tuesday - the first time Australia has seen interest rates fall below 1 per cent. Mr Chalmers told Sky News \u201cThe behaviour of the banks in this instance has been indefensible\u201d and that the prime minister is \u201chypocritical\u201d for not passing on the interest rate cuts through the deeming system to Australian pensioners. \u201cThe Reserve bank has made it really clear that the banks are still incredibly profitable by international standards,\u201d he said.
