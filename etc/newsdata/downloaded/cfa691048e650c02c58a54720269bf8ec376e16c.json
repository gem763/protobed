(Noam Galai/Getty)\n\nEditorial Writer\n\nWho is Caroline Calloway? All she\u2019s ever wanted is for you to ask.\n\nFor starters, the Instagram influencer who seems to be everywhere this week, from Twitter feeds to text messages to articles across the mainstream media, isn\u2019t all that influential. She has around 800,000 followers, which might seem tremendous to picture-posting dilettantes but looks laughable up against the platform\u2019s true Svengalis. She\u2019s not a makeup maven, or an exercise eminence, or even a vlogging guru.\n\nCaroline Calloway is just a girl, or woman if you prefer. The way she has transformed herself into something much more gives us a look at the underpinnings of the Internet image-making machine \u2014 and at ourselves.\n\nCalloway claimed her initial not-quite-fame as an American at the University of Cambridge, posting pretty photos of her pretty existence with very, very long confessional captions. She marketed these as a sort of real-time memoir, an idea interesting enough to publishers, apparently, to earn her hundreds of thousands of dollars in a book advance.\n\nYet it isn\u2019t Calloway\u2019s success that has landed her in the country\u2019s top papers. It\u2019s her failure. The meltdown of her life was immensely more interesting than the life itself because it allowed us to congratulate ourselves on just how right we always were about the Web.\n\nLast spring, Calloway started advertising worldwide workshops on creativity and brand-building, which it turned out weren\u2019t actually worldwide and weren\u2019t actually workshops. She had promised, for $176.68 including processing fees, customized care packages, orchid crowns and Mason jar gardens in cities across the globe. She delivered (at the few events she did hold) individual flowers attendees were then forced to return, unadorned jars accompanied by packets of seeds and seating right smack on the floor.\n\nThis \u201cscam\u201d caught the attention of one journalist, whose attention caught the attention of several others, and suddenly Calloway was a star. She had tried to be famous for being famous; now she was infamous for being infamous.\n\nThe book deal had been a bust long before the tour because the author couldn\u2019t deliver. She was an Adderall addict whose feigned fairy tale turned out to be a horror show. And those 1,200 Mason jars promised as miniature gardens but presented almost entirely empty gave us an unimpeachable metaphor for the narrative we wanted about Instagram and its ilk: Everyone is always pretending things are perfect, and nothing ever is.\n\nMany must have found it gratifying to see a facade, carefully crafted as the Henri Matisse rip-offs Calloway sold as original art, so viciously rent apart \u2014 especially to those who\u2019ve always felt our own lives don\u2019t offer enough material to even pretend they\u2019re splendid.\n\nThe saga of Calloway is circulating even more widely today because her one-time best buddy, Natalie Beach, wrote a tell-all essay in New York Magazine\u2019s woman-focused vertical, the Cut, revealing herself as the Instagrammer\u2019s longtime ghostwriter. Even Calloway\u2019s initial followers, the piece reveals, were fake. She had purchased them as a ploy to pretend she was popular until popularity arrived.\n\nBut are we really peeking behind the curtain, or are we tangled up in it?\n\nCalloway is still selling us something. She built her brand from the start, at least in part, by pointing out the deceptiveness of brand-building, blending Instagram\u2019s typical aspirational posts with just enough vulnerability to make her look, well, genuine. This started with boy drama and ended darker: Calloway first admitted her addiction to Adderall by declaring that \u201cposting about drugs is so obviously the opposite of cappuccino art and avocado toast.\u201d\n\nNow, Calloway is saying that even this supposedly unvarnished portrayal was varnished after all. She\u2019s calling herself a liar by calling her ghostwriter a truth-teller, and she\u2019s doing it to keep earning attention. She has promoted the Cut piece, relentlessly, in a series of chatty mea culpas laced with gut-wrenching guilt. Calloway is marketing reality by contrasting it with the unreality she was selling everyone before.\n\nAnd it looks like we\u2019re buying it. People remain skeptical of Calloway herself, of course. Even her announcement that her father had died this week was greeted with perplexity rather than untinged sympathy, partly because her post was written in the same style as all the posts that came before it (and partly because it doubled as promotion for an NBC News interview).\n\nBut Beach\u2019s essay, commentators have declared, is a raw examination of female friendship, an Elena Ferrante novel for the digital age. It\u2019s a searing display of how the commodification of the self that social media encourages is corrosive and corrupting. The millennial commentariat is bent on teasing out the authentic in a tale whose entire foundation is fakery.\n\nThe kicker? The belief that there\u2019s a there here, and the need to engage with it \u2014 the tweeting, the writing, the asking what everyone else is talking about that has spawned so many helpful explainers \u2014 comes from the same phenomenon that Calloway proved she understood when she bought those fake followers. Influence begets influence.\n\nIs Calloway a scammer? Her ghostwriter asks, and then she answers. Maybe, but if so, \u201cHer first mark is always herself.\u201d\n\nSame goes for the rest of us.\n\nRead more:\n\nFoster Kamer: A viral story about a bad friendship gives us exactly what we want: Someone to judge\n\nMolly Roberts: The Instagram egg was always doomed\n\nJohn Kelly: When it comes to social media manipulation, we\u2019re our own worst enemy\n\nGabrielle Bluestone: The college admissions scam is the perfect scandal in the golden age of grifters\n\nCatherine Rampell: Millennials need to learn to lose\n\nAnne Boyd Rioux: Can young people be lured away from Twitter and Instagram to books?", "description": "Caroline Calloway is still selling us something.", "authors": ["Molly Roberts", "Editorial Writer Covering Technology", "Editorial Writer", "September At Pm", "Molly Roberts Writes About Technology", "Society For The Post'S Opinions Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Sv1pc3lc5dse0bbNrSaqrJHMIG0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6GNWWMFWARGSVMMDLHCN7R3Z3U.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
