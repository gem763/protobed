He has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement \u2013 a global pact to stem the rise in global temperatures - and has a policy of maximizing American production of fossil fuels.\n\nThunberg has said she does not believe she can convince Trump or other climate change doubters that global warming is real, but hopes they will take briefings from \u201cactual scientists and experts in this area.\u201d here\n\nThe 16-year-old activist last year started skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Sweden\u2019s parliament and is bound for New York later this month, where she will take part in the U.N. climate summit.\n\nPrior to that, Thunberg will address Congress on climate change and later join Democratic lawmakers and plaintiffs in the Juliana v the United States case - in which a group of young people sued the government for failing to address climate change \u2013 at the Supreme Court.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nThunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize earlier this year after the number of students taking part in the \u201cFridays for Future\u201d school strikes broke 2 million across 135 countries here She was named one of the world\u2019s most influential people by Time magazine in May.\n\nConservative and far-right lawmakers in Europe have ridiculed Thunberg, mocking her as a \u201cguru of the apocalypse\u201d and a \u201cNobel prize of fear.\u201d She was also described as a \u201cdeeply disturbed messiah\u201d leading a \u201ccult\u201d in an opinion column by conservative Australian commentator Andrew Bolt.\n\nThunberg arrived in the United States last month on a racing yacht equipped with solar panels and underwater electricity turbines to ensure that it left no carbon footprint. She is taking a year off from school to travel around the Americas.", "description": "Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who has shot to global fame for inspiring worldwide student strikes to promote action against climate change, took her mission to President Donald Trump\u2019s doorstep on Friday with a protest outside the White House.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429508784&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1UM", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
