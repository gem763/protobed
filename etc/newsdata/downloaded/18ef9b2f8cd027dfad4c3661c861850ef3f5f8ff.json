Selena Gomez was shrugging off the cryptic coincidences while heading to a meeting in Burbank on Wednesday\n\nSelena definitely looked like she meant business as she walked out into the sunshine, carrying a sophisticated white hand bag.\n\nShe added yet another chic touch with a pearl choker necklace and head full of loose, romantic waves that tumbled just above her chest.\n\nSelena also complimented her complexion with a dash of rosy blush and smoky eye shadow.\n\nThe actress definitely looked as though she was feeling herself, and for good reason - she had just released some new music following a four year break from the spotlight to focus on her health.\n\nMaker and shaker: The actress definitely looked as though she was feeling herself, and for good reason - she had just released some new music following a four year break to focus on her health\n\nCoincidence? Fans started speculating Hailey was directly responding to Selena when she revealed she was listening to the song, I'll Kill You\n\nLose You To Love Me was released Wednesday at midnight, and the song appears to be about her failed relationship with Justin.\n\nLyrics seemingly reference the short amount of time it took for Justin to move on from Selena to Hailey.\n\n'You turned me down and now it's showing / In two months, you replaced us / Like it was easy / Made me think I deserved it.'\n\nMan and wife: Bieber rekindled his relationship with his now-wife Hailey shortly after the end of his relationship with Gomez\n\nShortly after the song was officially released, Hailey shared a screenshot of a Summer Walker song she was listening to entitled I'll Kill You.\n\nFans were quick to begin speculating the song was a response to Selena's newly released track.\n\n'Selena Gomez released a song (stream for clear skin) about her life experiences w an ex and leaving him behind (Justin Bieber now married to Hailey Baldwin) and like 5 minutes later Hailey Baldwin posted this.
