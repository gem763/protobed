The group estimates that Cuba had 5707 unreported cases, with most occurring in 2017. (The year, by the way, when Obama\u2019s \u201copening\u201d made U.S. travel to Cuba very chic--and very important to the Stalinist regime\u2019s coffers, especially those of the secret police and military who majority own Cuba\u2019s tourism infrastructure.)\n\n\u201cOf 91 travel-associated Zika cases identified in Florida from June 2017 to October 2018, the team found that all but one infected individual was returning from Cuba. \u2026\u201cLikewise, 63 of 64 travel-associated cases caught in Europe during that time frame involved travel to Cuba. Cuba\u2019s unrecognized (no--it was fully recognized by the Stalinist regime which kept it hush-hush!) Zika outbreak may have \u201csilently\u201d spread the virus to other parts of the world and continues to infect international visitors today.\u201d (Zika News)\n\nSo what\u2019s the big deal, some might ask? Well:\n\n\u201cZika virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus and can cause a birth defect called microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects\u2026 Zika primarily spreads through infected mosquitoes. You can also get Zika through sex without a condom with someone infected by Zika, even if that person does not show symptoms of Zika.\u201d (Center For Disease Controls.)\n\nCastroite Cuba, by the way, has long been regarded as the prostitution capital (including child) of the Western Hemisphere, multiplying the number of Cuban prostitutes during the '40s and '50s when their numbers were trivial in comparison, Hollywood lore notwithstanding. Some studies rank Castroite Cuba above even Bangkok in this vile category.\n\nWait?!....HARK!....What\u2019s that I hear?....The rumbling of hoofbeats?....Bugles blowing?....And what\u2019s that I see topping the crest of the hill?...A cloud of dust?....Banners fluttering?!.....\n\nWHY YES! It\u2019s the cavalry (in the form of The New York Times) to the rescue!\n\nNot to the rescue\u2014heaven forbid! -- of the duped people infected by a serious illness that causes serious birth effects. No, instead to the rescue of the reputation (and vital tourism income) of mass-murdering, terror-sponsoring liars responsible for the spread of the infection to Americans (and Cubans and Canadians and Europeans, etc.) In brief, to the rescue of their historic public-relations clients.\n\n\u201cThis was an unexpected finding,\u201d explained The New York Times last week (actually, not unexpected at all by people who understand how the Castro regime operates!) Cuba has a sophisticated public health system,\u201d (PUH-LEAZE!) stressed the straight-faced New York Times, \u201cand it had seemed to be winning the war against Zika, apparently avoiding the outbreaks seen on other Caribbean islands.\u201d (Another blatant LIE!)\n\n\u201cOfficials at P.A.H.O., an arm of the World Health Organization,\u201d continued a straight-faced New York Times, \u201cblamed the failure to publish timely data on the Cuba outbreak on a \u201ctechnical glitch.\u201d\n\nFine. Let\u2019s review some these Castroite \u201ctechnical glitches\u201d in action, shall we:\n\nA few years ago Cuban doctor Dessy Mendoza was on the phone with a Miami radio station reporting an outbreak of dengue fever in eastern Cuba--suddenly KGB-trained police stormed his house and arrested him. He was charged and sentenced for \u201cspreading enemy propaganda.\u201d\n\nTotalitarian Cuba\u2019s \u201cLaw of National Dignity\u201d mandates jail sentences of three to 10 years for \u201canyone who, in a direct or indirect form, collaborates with the enemy\u2019s media.\u201d\n\nYes, amigos. That\u2019s what totalitarian regimes do. And\u2014though you\u2019d never guess it from their media and Democrat allies-- totalitarian is what Cuba still is, despite all the flashy tourism commercials for them by Conan O\u2019Brien, Beyonce, Jay-Z, The Kardashians, Gisele Bundchen (Mrs. Tom Brady,) Karl Lagerfeld, Jeff Flake, Barack Obama, etc., etc., etc.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of another Castroite \u201ctechnical glitch\":\n\nA few years ago Katherine Hirschfield, an Oklahoma University Doctoral candidate, undertook a study of Cuba\u2019s vaunted healthcare\u2014but as a participant rather than as regime-escorted \u201cscholar.\u201d (i.e. propagandist.) Her plan was to live for a year with a Cuban family in Cuba\u2019s second largest city of Santiago.\n\nTypical of \u201cscholarly\u201d studies that include a visit to Cuba, scholar Hirschfield admits that: \u201cMy project was intended to document and highlight Cuba\u2019s achievements in Social Medicine.\u201d (Hence her typically lightning-quick visa clearance).\n\nShortly after settling in with her Cuban hosts, Hirschfeld was shocked to find her neighborhood full of Cubans suffering from dengue fever--though she had never heard of this epidemic while in the U.S.\n\nBut upon every enquiry to the Castroite authorities (which included most of the doctors in the area) she was self-righteously harangued to the effect that dengue-- though rampant during the unspeakable Batista era--had been eradicated by the glorious Revolution shortly upon its triumph! She was obviously imagining things. Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Truth had spoken.\n\n(Actually: In pre Castro Cuba, Zika\u2014along with all the tropical diseases that periodically ravage Castroite Cuba from Zika to Chikungunya to Hepatitis A., to West Nile Virus \u2014were virtually unknown. )\n\nSoon Hirschfield caught dengue fever herself and was ushered into a crowded and typically filthy clinic that was swarming with mosquitoes and guarded by soldiers. The crowded conditions owed to the obvious epidemic of dengue fever then ravaging eastern Cuba--and still being denied by the authorities (and being unreported by the \u201cnews\u201d bureaus with their \u201cintrepid investigative reporters\u201d so graciously hosted by Castro). The ubiquitous armed and vigilant soldiers (i.e. \u201ctechnical glitches\u201d) were evidence of the Stalinist regime\u2019s craving to keep the epidemic secret.\n\nInfected herself, and in a filthy hospital crammed to suffocation with Cubans suffering horribly from the disease, Katherine Hirschfeld took a cue from Groucho Marx and finally decided to believe her eyes rather than Castro\u2019s Ministry of Truth.\n\nA desperate Hirschfield tried phoning her family from Cuba to inform them of her plight. Immediately armed soldiers (i.e. \u201ctechnical glitches\u201d) grabbed her and prevented the call.\n\nFor some reason when Michael Moore, CNN, The New York Times, MSNBC, etc. etc. etc. visit Cuba to extol the marvels of Cuba\u2019s Potemkin healthcare to the world they never run into any \u201ctechnical glitches.\u201d Funny, isn't it?\n\nBut perhaps my earlier branding of Castroite Cuba as a \u201cNew York Times public relations client\u201d strikes some of my amigos as unnecessarily hyperbolic? Perhaps even as untrue?\n\nWell, if so, I can only answer that Fidel Castro himself begs to differ with you. In fact, he amply agreed with my categorization of The New York Times vis- a- vis his Stalinist regime. To wit:\n\n\u201cTo our American friend Herbert Matthews with gratitude. Without your help, and without the help of the New York Times, the Revolution in Cuba would never have been.\u201d (Fidel Castro on a special visit to New York Times headquarters in April 1959, where he pinned a glittering medal of gratitude on New York Times \u201creporter\u201d Herbert Matthew.)", "description": "\u201cA new analysis of Zika-infected travelers who returned to the .09/02/2019 3:11:14AM EST.", "authors": ["Humberto Fontova", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/295/f331f344-9e22-44be-9841-1e2db6e677c0.jpg"}
