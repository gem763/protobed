The system will presumably descend from the North Pole ushering in a swath of low pressure spanning from Greenland to the northwest coast of Ireland.\n\nIn the estimation of some meteorologists, the 2019-2020 cold spell will rival the bitter winter of 1963, believed to have been the coldest in 200 years.\n\nOther weather-watchers are less confident that this winter will be a record-breaker. Mark Saunders, for example, Professor of Climate Prediction at UCL, claims that there is only a 57 percent probability that this winter will be colder than last year\u2019s.\n\nLate last month, a group of over 500 scientists and climate professionals sent a \u201cEuropean Climate Declaration\u201d to the Secretary-General of the United Nations appealing for an open debate on climate change.\n\n\u201cClimate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,\u201d the declaration stated. \u201cScientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,\u201d they continued.\n\nThe declaration\u2019s signers insisted that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable trend of the day.\n\n\u201cThere is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm,\u201d they noted. \u201cWe strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.\u201d\n\nNo matter what the winter shapes up to be, there is a 100 percent probability that climate alarmists will find some way to attribute the weather to global warming and carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Researchers are forecasting an average temperature in the UK of just 3.9\u00baC (39\u00baF) for January to February, \u201cthe coldest weather in 30 years.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas D.
