Independence\u201d as the throng of people made its way up the city\u2019s famous Royal Mile.\n\n\u201cScotland is second class in this union,\u201d said Peter Johnston, 22, one of the organisers of the march.\n\n\u201cAs an independent nation it will be world leading in many ways. In the United Kingdom we don\u2019t reach our full potential.\u201d\n\nAmong those present was lawyer and Scottish Nationalist (SNP) lawmaker Joanna Cherry, who was behind one of the successful legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament.\n\nShe was also one of the main backers of a law passed last month forcing Johnson to ask the European Union for more time to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of the Tory rule,\u201d said attendee Donna Barkley, 47, a bus driver. \u201cI\u2019m sick of being told what to do\u2026 We need independence today.\u201d\n\nThe group organising Saturday\u2019s march, All Under One Banner, claimed more than 200,000 people turned out for the rally \u2014 far exceeding their predictions.\n\nPolice Scotland did not give an estimate of the crowd\u2019s size.\n\nScotland voted against independence in a 2014 referendum by 55 percent.\n\nBut nationalists argue that the 2016 British referendum in favour of Brexit means another independence referendum is necessary \u2014 because Scotland voted by 62 percent to stay in the European Union.\n\nScotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the SNP, has argued that Brexit will devastate the economy.\n\nNationalists also argue that some people voted against independence thinking it would guarantee their place inside the EU.\n\n\u201cScotland in particular has a lot of people coming from all over (the world) and everybody is pretty much unhappy with this situation,\u201d said Serena Micalizzi-Coyle, a 50-year-old tour operator on the march, referring to Britain\u2019s impending departure from the EU.\n\n\u201cThis is a good day to demonstrate that we are united,\u201d she added.\n\nSturgeon, who wants a second independence referendum in 2021, was unable to attend the march, but tweeted a message of support.\n\n\u201cBe in no doubt \u2013 independence is coming,\u201d she said in the message.\n\nA small number of pro-Union protesters carrying Union Jack flags staged a counter-demonstration in central Edinburgh.", "description": "Edinburgh (AFP) \u2013 Tens of thousands of Scottish independence supporters marched in Edinburgh on Saturday, as calls grow for a fresh vote on Scotland", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/baf39c_set-off-holyrood-park-marched-up-royal-mile-in-heart-scottish-capital-tens-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
