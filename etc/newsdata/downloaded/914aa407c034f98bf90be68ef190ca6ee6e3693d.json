SNDL, -2.65% said Wednesday that class-action lawsuits alleging it failed to disclose that a large amount of cannabis had been returned by a client because of contamination are without merit and said it would vigorously defend itself against them. The Canadian cannabis company said the suits stem from a \"single online article, which erroneously described a since-resolved commercial dispute.\" The article, which was cited in the suits, was a report by MarketWatch in August that said Zenabis Global Inc. ZENA, +7.69% returned a half-ton of Sundial cannabis because it contained visible mold, parts of rubber gloves and other non-cannabis material, citing people familiar with the matter. \"All of our customer agreements include provisions to replace or return product under certain conditions,\" Sundial said in a statement. \"The amount of product returned was a fraction of the 554 kilograms erroneously quoted in the article.\" Shares were not yet active in premarket trading but have fallen 43% in the past month, while the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, -1.72% has lost 20% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.56% has dipped by about 3%.", "description": "Sundial Growers Inc. said Wednesday that class-action lawsuits alleging it failed to disclose that a large amount of cannabis had been returned by a client...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
