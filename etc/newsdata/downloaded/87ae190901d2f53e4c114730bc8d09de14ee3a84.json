A lot of people believed in me, put in a lot of hard work.\u201d\n\nScheffler, who played in the morning from the back nine first, also had a string of birdies. He made four in a row to start the round at White Sulphur Springs, then added two more to make the turn at six under.\n\nHe collected two more, including one at his last hole for his 62.\n\nNiemann, also starting on the back nine, used an eagle at the 12th and six birdies to catch Scheffler.\n\nShelton, the first day leader, then caught both of them, making six birdies after an early bogey.\n\nSouth Korean Im Sung-jae added a 67 to a first-round 66 and was six strokes off the pace.", "description": "Kevin Chappell became the 10th player to break 60 on the PGA Tour as he used a record-tying nine consecutive birdies to shoot an 11-under 59 at the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
