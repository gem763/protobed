Mitt Romney (R-Utah) Saturday morning, calling the 2012 GOP presidential nominee a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019\u201d and calling for the senator\u2019s impeachment a day after Romney criticized Trump for asking foreign leaders to investigate a political opponent.\n\n\u201cSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump continued, \u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s!\u201d\n\nHours later, Trump hit Romney again, this time suggesting Utah voters regretted their choice and that Romney should be impeached.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nRomney won his Senate seat in 2018, with 62.6 percent of the vote.\n\nIt is not clear what Romney did in Trump\u2019s opinion to deserve impeachment other than condemn the behavior that led to an impeachment inquiry into the president. A U.S. senator cannot be impeached. Instead, the Constitution gives the House or Senate the power to expel one of its own by a two-thirds vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attack on Romney underscores why so few Republicans do so, out of fear of the president\u2019s wrath.\n\n[Republican dissidents who speak out become targets of viral disinformation]\n\nAfter Trump suggested on the White House lawn Thursday that China investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Romney denounced the president, one of the few Republicans to do so.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney tweeted on Friday. \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nOnly one other GOP senator has criticized Trump\u2019s behavior. But Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) at the same time.\n\n\u201cHold up: Americans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth,\u201d Sasse told the Omaha World-Herald. \u201cIf the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.\u201d\n\nBut Sasse also said Schiff was \u201crunning a partisan clown show in the House.\u201d\n\nTrump and Romney have a long, complicated history. In 2012, Trump, who pushed a birther conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama, publicly endorsed the former Massachusetts governor for president.\n\nBut a fter Romney\u2019s loss to Obama, Trump derided Romney\u2019s performance.\n\nRomney actually outperformed Trump in the popular vote, winning 47.2 percent of the vote in 2012 to Trump\u2019s 46.1 percent in 2016. But unlike Trump, Romney failed to win enough states to secure an electoral college victory.\n\nRomney was critical of Trump during the 2016 campaign, calling him a \u201cphony.\u201d But Romney broke bread with Trump after he won the presidency. At the time, Trump was considering Romney for secretary of state.\n\nWhen Romney won his Senate seat in 2018, he promised in an op-ed published the night before his swearing-in that he would stand up to Trump as needed, though until now he has stayed mostly on the sidelines.", "description": "Trump tweet also brought up Romney\u2019s failed 2012 presidential bid, claims senator begged for endorsement and to be secretary of state.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3kLJs6aRBFXTx7bFBwEkSWj70n4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EAQ3HBXHREI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
