In May, his horns measured at 10 feet, 7.4 inches.\n\nBucklehead's owner is 14-year-old Marceala Gonzales, of Rocksprings, Texas.\n\nShe won him almost five and a half years ago at another show when her name was picked during a draw.\n\nFive breeders had donated steer to the raffle and when Marceala won, she was allowed to pick the steer she wanted. That was when she selected then six-month-old Bucklehead.\n\nBucklehead is owned by 14-year-old Marceala Gonzales (right), who won him in a raffle nearly five-and-a-half years ago. Her brother, Leandro (left), is his handler and exhibitor\n\nTo transport Bucklehead safely, Leandro tapes tennis balls to the ends of his horns and the steer is driven around by a personal chauffeur\n\nMarceala's brother, Leandro, is Bucklehead's handler and exhibitor at the 12 to 15 shows he attends a year.\n\nTheir mother, Pauline Gonzales, said that Leandro tapes tennis balls to the ends of the steer's horns to protect them while he's in his eight-and-a-half foot wide trailer, which is driven by a personal chauffeur.\n\n'We have to be very careful, he is our big baby,' Pauline told the newspaper.\n\nBucklehead is expected to attend the Longhorn Show in Llano, Texas, from October 19 to 21.\n\nHe was born on October 13, 2013, and bred by Brent and Cindy Bolen of Bolen Longhorns, in Lufkin, Texas.", "description": "The six-year-old longhorn, called Bucklehead, had his prodigious horn span measured at 11-feet, 1.8-inches, tip to tip, while he was being shown at Lawton, Oklahoma's Horn Showcase.", "authors": ["Maxine Shen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/07/19912124-0-image-a-19_1571465682436.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
