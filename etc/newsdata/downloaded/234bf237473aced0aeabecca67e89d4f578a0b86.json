The South Bend, Indiana mayor had a stellar evening yesterday in Ohio, second only to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn previous debates, the 37-year-old Afghanistan war veteran and Rhodes Scholar came across as genuine and thoughtful, if not a bit stiff. But on Tuesday, Buttigieg gave his most impassioned and aggressive performance yet, and he took no prisoners.\n\nThe former naval intelligence analyst didn\u2019t waste any time going after frontrunner Warren on multiple issues; instead, he concentrated on framing himself as the alternative to Joe Biden for voters looking for a moderate candidate with a cleaner record, more energy and fresher views. Importantly, his views echo those of many Americans who aren\u2019t ready for obligatory Medicare-for-All plans, among other more progressive proposals. With the Iowa caucuses coming up on February 3rd, Buttigieg may have arrived on the scene just in time.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhen former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke attacked Buttigieg over the logistics of mandatory buybacks of AK-47s, Buttigieg blasted him with one of the best lines of the night, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need a lesson from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d But Buttigieg isn\u2019t the type to deliver a one-liner then coast. He followed up on that jab with the most important point about the gun control debate, explaining that \u201cthe problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress\u201d, not other Democrats who may disagree on how exactly to end the gun violence crisis in the US.\n\nThe moderator\u2019s questioning about Trump\u2019s withdrawal of US troops from Syria and the resulting violence understandably provoked some emotional responses from the candidates.\n\nButtigieg called out the only other veteran onstage, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, for her views on Syria after Gabbard echoed Republican talking points that the US pullout of Syria wasn\u2019t Trump's fault and that the US had wrongly been in Syria for a \u201cregime change war\u201d. When Buttigieg responded that her statement was \u201cdead wrong\u201d, he delivered an eloquent and hard-hitting explanation of the military situation: \u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it is a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values. Look, I didn\u2019t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan, but it\u2019s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we\u2019re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of Isis.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Bernie Sanders schooled everyone when, while other candidates referred to Turkey as an ally, the Senator from Vermont reminded his onstage colleagues and the audience that \u201cTurkey is not a US ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. The crisis here, as I think Joe [Biden] said and Pete [Buttigieg] said, is when you begin to betray people.\u201d\n\nIt's true that Buttigieg remains a long shot in the race \u2013 he\u2019s polling at just above 5 per cent. But if Warren could forgive him for his jabs at her policy positions and proposals, as a VP running mate he could provide the infusion of moderation and youth that some analysts think her campaign is lacking.
