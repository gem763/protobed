Add Interest\n\nCandidates have been sending out dire pleas heading into these final days, pushing out a cascade of fundraising emails and running ad blitzes on social media.\n\nThe close of books of the third fundraising quarter also comes on the heels of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, which has helped fuel a last-minute boost to the president's re-election campaign efforts as well as his 2020 Democratic rivals' war chests.\n\nSix of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have dropped out of the race since last fundraising quarter, the field could narrow even further as the race enters into a new crucial phase in the protracted contest.\n\nThe third quarter covered the three months of July, August and September.\n\nABC News will continue to update this story as more candidates release details on their fundraising numbers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's re-election campaign sets another record breaking quarter in fundraising\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nThe Trump campaign, his joint fundraising entities and the Republican National Committee have raised $125 million in the third quarter and ended September with more than $156 million cash on hand, an RNC official told ABC News.\n\nThe RNC and the Trump campaign are touting the president's re-election efforts have twice as much cash on hand as former President Barack Obama's re-election campaign had at this point in 2011, which is verifiable through campaign finance records. By the end of September 2011, Obama's 2012 campaign had $61.4 million and the Democratic National Committee had $14.7 million, bringing their total to $76 million.\n\nUnlike his Democratic rivals, Trump's haul includes money raised through the president's campaign as well as his joint fundraising committees with the Republican National Committee. The Democrats are all currently fundraising without the help of the party committee.\n\nTrump's latest fundraising haul comes as the campaign and the RNC dig into their counter impeachment efforts -- including the campaign's $8 million cable and digital ad buy targeting former Vice President Joe Biden over Ukraine and a $2 million television and digital buy from the RNC over the weekend.\n\nBernie Sanders reinforces his grassroots fundraising prowess with $25.3 million third quarter haul\n\nDespite recent polling that showed his campaign trailing behind some of his 2020 Democratic rivals, the Vermont senator set the tone for third quarter fundraising Tuesday morning, announcing a whopping $25.3 million haul. The number eclipses Sen. Elizabeth Warren's combined total raised in the first two quarters and leaves Sanders with over $61.5 million in receipts this year.\n\nCheryl Senter/AP\n\nSanders has continued a strong grassroots support base, bringing in more than 1.4 million individual contributions this quarter for an average donation of $17.90, according to the campaign. So far this year, the Sanders campaign has received more than 3.3 million donations with an average contribution for the year of $19.\n\nPete Buttigieg falls short of his second quarter total but remains a strong fundraiser\n\nThe South Bend mayor also, who in recent polls lands among the middle tier, announced Tuesday morning that it raised $19.1 million in the third quarter with 182,000 new donors and average donation of $32, slipping from the top fundraiser title he had boasted in the second quarter when he raised $24.8 million.\n\nElijah Nouvelage/Reuters\n\nButtigieg, who has successfully courted both high-dollar donors as well as small-dollar supporters, however, remains a prominent fundraiser, bringing in a total of more than $51 million this year from more than $1.25 million individual contributions.\n\nKamala Harris raises $11.6 million in third quarter\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., announced that she raised $11.6 million with an average donation of $34 between July and September, trailing slightly behind her fundraising from previous two quarters. According to the campaign, the California senator ended the latest quarter with $10 million cash on hand. She is polling toward the middle of the pack of contenders.\n\nMike Blake/Reuters\n\nIn total, Harris has raised $35.5 million so far this year from more than 850,000 individual contributions.\n\nCory Booker eclipses Q2 total, raises $6 million in third quarter\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced his campaign raised over $6 million in the third quarter, including $2.16 million in the final 10 days of the period. The last minute bump in fundraising stemmed from an internal memo, which was leaked and posted on Medium on Sept. 21, in which Booker's campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, said the candidate needs to raise $1.7 million by Sept. 30 to be in a position to continue running for president. He has trailed far behind the front-runners in polls.\n\nThe third quarter was the best quarter for the campaign, with September being the campaign's strongest fundraising month.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP\n\nThe campaign noted that the final push included more than 46,000 donations. The third quarter haul represents a more than 30% increase over the second quarter - when Booker brought in just over $4.5 million.\n\nDespite hanging their campaign's hopes on raking in $1.7 million 10 days before the deadline, Booker's campaign manager said their strategy moving forward is grounded in their belief that the race remains \"wide open,\" as well as, efforts to hire 40 new staff members, open offices in early states, launch a ballot access program, build out their email list and kick-start another ambitious push to raise $3 million by the end of October.\n\nABC News' Adam Kelsey, Zohreen Shah, Justin Gomez, Rachel Scott and Will Steakin contributed to this report.", "description": "President Donald Trump and RNC raised a record $125M in the third quarter.
