We took a look at how much they're paid across the US.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment Statistics program provides data on employment and wages for different occupations. Using data from that program, we put together the above map showing median annual pay for police and sheriff's patrol officers in each state and DC.\n\nAs with many occupations, pay for police officers tends to be higher in bigger, urbanized, and coastal states and lower in southern and Midwestern states.\n\nMedian annual earnings in May 2018, the most recent period for which data is available, ranged from $34,350 in Mississippi to $104,790 in California.", "description": "Police officers put their lives on the line every day as part of their jobs.
