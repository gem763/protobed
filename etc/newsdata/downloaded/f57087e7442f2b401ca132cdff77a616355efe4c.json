The sanctions have even affected sports, with Major League Baseball banning players from playing in Venezuela\u2019s league due to its ties to the government.\n\nWashington accuses Maduro\u2019s government, which has overseen a collapse of the OPEC nation\u2019s economy, of corruption and human rights violations. Maduro accuses the United States of seeking to overthrow him and attributes the country\u2019s economic collapse to sanctions.\n\nWhile last week\u2019s licence made clear banks could serve retired Venezuelan state employees, FIBA is still awaiting guidance from OFAC on how to treat current state employees who are not sanctioned, Gutierrez said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that there is still some clarity needed,\u201d Gutierrez said.", "description": "An industry group representing Florida banks pushed for an exemption to U.S. sanctions on Venezuela that were issued last week, executives said on Tuesday, arguing the measures had affected customers with no ties to President Nicolas Maduro.", "authors": ["Luc Cohen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
