People always think there\u2019s something wrong with me because I don\u2019t have that many girlfriends. Like, I love girls, I do love girls and I love their sensitivity. But that\u2019s why I identify more as a gay man because I like guys but I also identify as a guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my head I feel like I\u2019m a transgender female to male but also a drag queen,\u201d she added, explaining that she likes \u201cglam\u201d and dressing up but also likes to be \u201clow-key\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Yes, one thousand per cent. Do I identify with my natural born gender? A thousand per cent. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m at and I feel really free and liberated.\u201d\n\nIn response to the monologue, which has been viewed more than 856,000 times, people have accused Paytas of coming out as trans for \"clicks\" and criticised her for being \u201cinsensitive\u201d and \u201cdegrading\u201d to both transgender people and the struggles they experience.\n\n\u201cAs a trans man, I can\u2019t even begin to explain how insulting this is,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou aren\u2019t trans because you\u2019re attracted to gay men. You aren\u2019t trans because you don\u2019t wear makeup all the time or you relate to your male friends more.\"\n\nAnother said: \u201cThis is just too much. It\u2019s so disrespectful to the people who truly are transgender and risk their lives everyday just to express who they are publicly and not just for views.\u201d\n\nOthers said they hope Paytas takes the opportunity to learn more about the transgender community, with many people pointing out that being trans means not identifying with the gender you were born.\n\n\u201cI really hope you do some research on what being transgender is and realise how problematic and hurtful this video is for so many trans people,\u201d someone else said, while another tweeted: \u201cTrisha Paytas is a living example of why people need to be more educated about being transgender.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
