USA TODAY Sports\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Just a few minutes into the biggest start of his career, scenarios were already running through the mind of Atlanta Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz.\n\nOne run? No big deal. Two? It\u2019s not what you\u2019d want, but good teams come back from that all the time. Even three \u2013 hey, these guys won 97 games in the regular season for a reason.\n\nWith each pitch, Foltynewicz held out hope that he could stop this game \u2013 this very, very important game \u2013 from unraveling in front of him. And then...\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cStuff happens fast.\u201d\n\nThere is no genteel way to talk about what happened Wednesday in Game 5 of the National League Division Series. One team showed up ready to play baseball. The other was prepared to vomit all over itself.\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals advanced to the NLCS with a 13-1 win over the Braves, but history will only remember one thing: A 10-run first inning that was as much an implosion by Atlanta as it was a credit to the Cardinals.\n\nAnd for the Braves, who haven't won a postseason series since 2001 , giving up 10 runs in a deciding game before even getting a turn at bat is something they may never live down.\n\n\u201cEveryone had sky-high confidence going into that game,\u201d first baseman Freddie Freeman said. \u201cThen them scoring 10 runs, that\u2019s hard to swallow. Everything went wrong from the get-go.\u201d\n\nFreddie Freeman looks on during the Game 5 loss.

Was it the leadoff walk Foltynewicz issued to Dexter Fowler after having such exceptional command in Game 2? Was it Freeman booting a ground ball from Yadier Molina that would have been the second and maybe third outs of the inning? Was it the bases-loaded walk by reliever Max Fried to Cardinals pitcher Jack Flaherty?\n\nMaybe it doesn\u2019t matter. It was happening and happening fast, and suddenly a long season and a taut playoff series had been buried under the Braves\u2019 mistakes and the Cardinals\u2019 bats.\n\n\u201cWe discussed it at the beginning, the crowd was going to be loud and we had to go out and try to get on them early,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cLast time we faced (Foltynewicz) he was a little hard to see but we knew at the top of the lineup we had to get it going and that's what we did.\u201d\n\nStill, a good inning in a game of this magnitude might be two or three runs. A great inning might be four or five. But 10? That doesn\u2019t happen. In fact, it had never happened to lead off a playoff game.\n\n\u201cYou just got to try to make it go your way and believe first off that the tide\u2019s going to turn,\u201d Braves left fielder Adam Duvall said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone lost hope. When you get punched in the mouth, you don\u2019t just fold up, you get out there and try to punch back.\u201d\n\nFLAHERTY: Did Cardinals make the right call letting ace go deep?\n\nBRAVES: No foam tomahawks handed out amidst backlash\n\nOf course, all 43,122 people in the stadium knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen. The Cardinals hadn\u2019t even recorded an out yet and players on both sides understood the magnitude of what had just happened.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to surprise anybody,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cOur guys are going to go out and do their job but 10 runs is something else. That\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\nAnd for the Braves, that something else is the ultimate indignity of failing to show up at all when everyone was watching. This is a team that made the playoffs a year ago as something of a surprise, and when they lost to the Dodgers in four games the mood was upbeat. This time, it was disconsolate, with lots of quiet hugs and players racing past each other to stand in front of the media and take part of the blame.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come through. I know everybody\u2019s going to say what they want to say, but this one\u2019s on me,\u201d said Freeman, who had two hits in Game 1 and two that meant very little in Game 5 and nothing in between. \u201cWe all know we had a good enough team to win this whole thing. Last year was a hooray, we proved a lot of people wrong. This year we expected to win the division and go far in the playoffs and we didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe Braves have plenty of flaws in this series to point to. They could have ended it in four but didn\u2019t. They could have won Game 1 but blew a lead in the eighth inning and didn't convert enough scoring opportunities. Veteran Nick Markakis was 3-for-21 in the series. Catcher Brian McCann, who announced his retirement after the game, went 3-for-16. Josh Donaldson was 3-for-19.\n\nAnd still, what will likely stick to this franchise the longest unless it wins a World Series is the first inning from hell it put together in Game 5.\n\n\u201cNot even getting out of the first inning, not getting a chance to see the lineup a few times through, it\u2019s very embarrassing,\u201d Foltynewicz said. \u201cEspecially at a stage like this for people to see that, to let millions of people down. It\u2019s a tough situation. You don't expect it to go down the way it did.\u201d\n\nNobody could have. But somehow, with so much on the line, the Braves made their worst nightmare a reality.", "description": "By the time the Braves came to bat in the bottom of the first, they were already facing a 10-0 deficit.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
