No, I do not accept it.\n\n\u2018You do not have to be fatalistic in certain situations. I have always been respectful and humble. Even if I do not agree with the coach, I do not criticise him.\n\n\u2018But in myself, I cannot accept it because I know what I\u2019m worth on a pitch. Last year, when I felt that I deserved to play, I asked the coach for explanations.\u2019\n\nProbed on his decision to swap the Emirates for Stamford Bridge, he continued: \u2018It was not easy to leave Arsenal for Chelsea two years ago. I loved Arsenal.\n\nGiroud scored France\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifying winner from the spot away to Iceland (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018But it was a progression because Chelsea is the English club that has won the most titles, with Manchester City, in ten years.\n\n\u2018I had competitors in attack \u2013 Morata, Higuain, who ended up leaving. I won at the end: I played the final of the FA Cup in 2018 and the European Cup final in 2019.\n\n\u2018Once again, I\u2019m starting the year in difficulty, but as my brother said, I have always built myself in the face of adversity. Although I would like there to be less!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Olivier Giroud says he cannot accept his current situation at Chelsea, having fallen behind Tammy Abraham in the pecking order, but he does not regret leaving Arsenal for the Blues....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1156968454_1570923414.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
