Now the Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is taking the fight to the social media company\u2019s own turf by taking out a series of Facebook ads that make false statements about Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cBreaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\u201d the ads read, above a photograph of a recent Oval Office meeting between the billionaire tech executive and the president.\n\nJulia Carrie Wong (@juliacarriew) Elizabeth Warren is now running FB ads with a false statement about Mark Zuckerberg and FB endorsing Trump for president, to draw attention to FB's controversial policy allowing politicians to make false statements in ads. https://t.co/hulwrb3cc3 pic.twitter.com/6zsPwXESKR\n\nThe statement isn\u2019t true, but as the Facebook executive Nick Clegg revealed late last month, the company\u2019s policies banning false statements from paid advertisements do not apply to politicians.\n\nThe exemption has drawn particular attention due to Facebook\u2019s decision to allow Trump to run an ad that was rejected by CNN for promoting a \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d narrative about Joe Biden.\n\nWarren\u2019s ad does correct the record \u2013 neither Facebook nor Zuckerberg has endorsed Trump \u2013 but goes on to argue her point: that \u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once\u201d and that \u201cIt\u2019s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable\u201d.\n\nFacebook's decision to promote Trump's lies shows how it's programmed to protect the powerful | Julia Carrie Wong Read more\n\nWarren has advocated for antitrust action against major tech companies and has called for Facebook to be broken up into multiple smaller companies.\n\nLast week, leaked transcripts of a July meeting at Facebook revealed that Zuckerberg had promised to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d and \u201cfight\u201d if Warren was elected and pursued her plan to break the company up. He also described her antitrust proposal as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat and said it would \u201csuck for us\u201d.\n\nWarren appears to relish the fight with Facebook. She shot back: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nA Facebook spokesperson responded to the new ads to CNN, which first reported on them, saying: \u201cIf Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.\u201d", "description": "Ad claims CEO backs Trump \u2013 then admits it\u2019s not true \u2013 after company admits letting politicians make false statements", "authors": ["Julia Carrie Wong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b738ae50a2e0098557f6f688a61fc086828b52be/0_0_3066_1840/master/3066.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=042ea53496218c93357d6a613b0f2bd5", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
