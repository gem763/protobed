It\u2019s a shirt, not a dress! I am a very average height, and thin, and it is so small! My entire butt is out, it\u2019s physically impossible to cover my butt and top at the same. It was so funny I sent a picture to all my friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would return it but since I\u2019m international it would cost me an arm & a leg to just return it.
