Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, was confronted at a town hall event Thursday by a constituent who repeatedly pressed her on when she and other Senate Republicans would draw a \"line\" on President Trump requesting help from Ukraine and China in investigating Joe Biden.\n\nThe Iowa resident, Amy Haskins, specifically asked Ernst about Trump's comments earlier that day that he would like China to look into the business dealings of the former vice president's son, Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cHow is that helping anybody?\u201d Haskins challenged Ernst at the event in Templeton, Iowa, drawing a round of applause.\n\n\u201cWhere is the line? When are you guys going to say, \u2018Enough\u2019 and stand up and say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m not backing any of this\u2019? ... You still stand there, silent, and your silence is supporting him,\" said Haskins.\n\nMSNBC'S CHUCK TODD SOUNDS THE ALARM ON TRUMP: 'THE NATIONAL NIGHTMARE IS UPON US'\n\nPresident Trump said Thursday that China should investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings, as he doubled down on his prior call for Ukraine to do the same. Trump struck a characteristically defiant tone while speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn, en route to Florida.\n\nCNN ANCHOR SLAMS PENCE ON RESPONSE TO TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL: 'WE ALL KNOW' THAT HE'S 'LYING'\n\nIn the controversial Juy 25 telephone call, President Trump requested his Ukrainian counterpart for help with a probe into Hunter Biden's dealings with gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter served on the board, and the elder Biden's role in ousting a prosecutor who had been looking into that company.\n\nThe phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prompted a whistleblower complaint and Democrats have deemed the request an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cWhistleblowers should be protected,\u201d Sen. Ernst said, agreeing with her Iowa Republican colleague, Sen. Chuck Grassley, who said this week that the whistleblower \u201cought to be heard out and protected.\u201d\n\nErnst told Haskins that Trump is \"going to say whatever the president is going to do\" and that she cannot \"speak for him.\"\n\n\"I know you can\u2019t speak for him, but you can speak for yourself,\" Haskins fired back.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cAnd I do,\u201d Ernst replied.\n\nHaskins asked Ernst whether Trump should be \"encouraging other countries to investigate his political rivals.\"\n\nErnst answered that \"corruption, no matter where it is, should be ferreted out.\"\n\nFox News' Tyler Olson contributed to this report.", "description": "Sen.
