Quickly, they knew they had to look into the weighty allegations leveled against one of the league\u2019s most high-profile players.\n\nBut the league soon came to realize that the nature of this case presents an unprecedented conundrum, people familiar with the proceedings said.\n\nThe civil lawsuit filed against Antonio Brown late Tuesday alleges that the Patriots wide receiver engaged in multiple incidents of sexual misconduct, including rape, against a former trainer. Yet because there is no indication that the accuser has filed police complaints related to any of the cases\u2014as is typical when the league has previously examined allegations of sexual violence\u2014there is not even a basic investigatory foundation that can be used to begin an internal assessment of the allegations.\n\nNow, the league and the team face a countdown clock to next Sunday\u2014Brown\u2019s potential first game with New England\u2014to address the star\u2019s status within the league and the team. And they are starting with no information about the allegations beyond what is in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Britney Taylor, who attended college with Brown and later trained him, alleges that in three instances over two years Brown engaged in varying degrees of misconduct toward her. She accuses him of exposing himself and forcibly kissing her; ejaculating on her back without her consent; and later physically overpowering her with \u201cgreat violence\u201d and raping her despite her cries for him to stop.\n\nIn a statement, Brown\u2019s attorney Darren Heitner denied \u201ceach and every allegation\u201d in the lawsuit and wrote that they will pursue all legal remedies to \u201cclear his name.\u201d The statement said Brown and Taylor engaged in consensual sex and says that Brown believes the lawsuit is a \u201cmoney grab.\u201d\n\nBrown, one of the league\u2019s top wide receivers, has yet to play a game for the Patriots after a highly-scrutinized off-season that began with him moving from the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Oakland Raiders via trade. Then after a series of problems there, he demanded and was granted his release last Saturday. He quickly agreed to a deal with the Patriots, and his first opportunity to play with the team would be this upcoming Sunday.\n\nThe NFL said in a statement it is investigating the allegations into Brown, and the Patriots said in a statement that they are aware of the lawsuit and Brown\u2019s response, and they take the allegations \u201cvery seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking it very seriously, all the way through the organization,\u201d Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Wednesday, when Brown practiced with the team.\n\nThe NFL has, for years, been rattled by allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by its players and criticism of the league\u2019s handling of those issues. But even a league that has developed broad experience investigating these matters and doling out punishment hasn\u2019t handled something quite like this.\n\n\u201cThe uniqueness is the civil nature,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this a new animal for the league\u201d\n\nIn this case, there is no indication from Taylor\u2019s lawsuit that these incidents were registered with police. A spokeswoman with the Pittsburgh Police, where the first incident allegedly occurred, said it has not received any criminal complaints of sexual assault involving Brown, and there are no active investigations into him.\n\nAntonio Brown was released by the Raiders last week. Photo: Jeff Chiu/Associated Press\n\nA spokesman for the state attorney in Miami-Dade County said they found no prior police investigative contacts regarding these individuals, but they will be reaching out to the pertinent police agencies. \u201cIf such police investigations exist, we would certainly be interested in those reports and any related evidence gathered,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nThe NFL and the Patriots have three primary options, people familiar with the matter said. The NFL could place him on the Commissioner\u2019s Exempt list, which would remove him from game action and allow him to still be paid while the situation plays out. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the burden to act will shift to the Patriots. The team could either play him or not\u2014the latter of which could involve his release.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t immediately clear, within the league, if Roger Goodell can immediately place Brown on the Commissioner\u2019s Exempt list, in part because the accusation stems from a civil case. The list can be used if a player has been charged, or if a league investigation determines that a player may have committed one of several offenses under the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\nThe list has been used in the past for high-profile off-the-field problems involving players such as Adrian Peterson and Kareem Hunt. But those cases had been investigated by police, or in the case of Hunt had a readily available piece of public evidence that showed the act.\n\nInside the Patriots, these same factors are driving their potential action--or possible inaction. Brown participated in at least some portions of practice with the team Wednesday as the team grappled with his future. The league reached out to the team Tuesday night to say an investigation would begin, but in the interim the team is treading delicately. The Patriots said in their statement that \u201cunder no circumstance does this organization condone sexual violence or assault,\u201d but it could also set a murky precedent inside the locker room if they released a player immediately after a civil lawsuit is filed without further due diligence.\n\nHe would most likely not still be with the team if these were criminal charges, one of the people said.\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "description": "The rape allegations against Antonio Brown came in a civil lawsuit, which presents unusual circumstances for the NFL as it tries to address the situation.", "authors": ["Andrew Beaton", "Andrew.Beaton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106251/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
