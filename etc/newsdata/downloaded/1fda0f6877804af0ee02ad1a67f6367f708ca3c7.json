(Jeenah Moon/Reuters)\n\nThe language that describes mental illness is constantly evolving. Caution is advised.\n\nGreta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate-change activist from Sweden, attracted the attention of America\u2019s 45th president this week. \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d Trump tweeted. This comment upset many progressives, but what really tipped them over the edge were the remarks made by the Daily Wire\u2019s Michael Knowles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile debating the progressive pundit Christopher Hahn on Fox News, Knowles described Greta Thunberg (who, as is well known, has Asperger syndrome) as a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international Left.\u201d Hahn immediately interjected, \u201cShame on you.\u201d The network later admonished Knowles, dubbing his remarks \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and releasing a statement that apologized to Thunberg and viewers.\n\nBut were the comments awful?\n\nIs it accurate and appropriate to describe Greta Thunberg as being \u201cmentally ill\u201d?\n\nAnd if not, why not?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn analyzing what is an incredibly complex question related to the evolution of psychiatry and language, it\u2019s helpful to zoom out from both politics and Thunberg. First, a quick note: Michael Knowles is a great guy (and a friend), and whether or not you decide that the words he used were the best available, know that his meaning has been mendaciously twisted in extremely bad faith.\n\n***\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association added Asperger\u2019s disorder to its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) in 1994 as a distinct form of autism, with the following diagnostic criteria:\n\nSevere and sustained impairment in social interaction, and the development of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests and activities that must cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.\n\nIn 2013, the current DSM-5 incorporated this into a broader category of pervasive developmental disorders called \u201cautism spectrum disorder.\u201d Behavioral symptoms are categorized by severity. See here:\n\nTable: Severity levels for autism spectrum disorder\n\nSeverity level Social communication Restricted, repetitive behaviors Level 3\n\n\u201cRequiring very substantial support\u201d Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause severe impairments in functioning, very limited initiation of social interactions, and minimal response to social overtures from others. For example, a person with few words of intelligible speech who rarely initiates interaction and, when he or she does, makes unusual approaches to meet needs only and responds to only very direct social approaches Inflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus or action. Level 2\n\n\u201cRequiring substantial support\u201d Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions; and reduced or abnormal responses to social overtures from others. For example, a person who speaks simple sentences, whose interaction is limited to narrow special interests, and how has markedly odd nonverbal communication. Inflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty changing focus or action. Level 1\n\n\u201cRequiring support\u201d Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments. Difficulty initiating social interactions, and clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful response to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions. For example, a person who is able to speak in full sentences and engages in communication but whose to-and-fro conversation with others fails, and whose attempts to make friends are odd and typically unsuccessful. Inflexibility of behavior causes significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Difficulty switching between activities. Problems of organization and planning hamper independence.\n\nThe helpfulness of psychiatric categories is, of course, limited. This has been observed from within the field, for instance by the late Hungarian psychiatrist Thomas Szasz. Szasz published provocatively titled books such as The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) and The Manufacture of Madness (1970), and though he did not deny the existence of suffering, distress, or mental conditions themselves, he believed that their status as diseases were flat-out wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather, \u201cpsychiatrists are not concerned with mental illnesses and their treatments,\u201d he argued. \u201cIn actual practice they deal with personal, social, and ethical problems in living.\u201d He also considered psychiatry inherently political. Szasz wrote that diseases \u2014 much like Virchow\u2019s concept of cellular pathology \u2014 were necessarily physical. And he therefore argued that \u201cmental illness\u201d is merely a metaphor: \u201cMinds can be \u2018sick\u2019 only in the sense that jokes are \u2018sick\u2019 or economies are \u2018sick.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough this view has never been accepted in mainstream psychiatry, it has elsewhere. For instance, in Illness as Metaphor (1978), Susan Sontag similarly argued that the language we use to describe illness is figurative and morally loaded. Though Sontag \u2014 who had breast cancer when she wrote Illness \u2013 was primarily discussing physical diseases, her point may be even more applicable to mental illness. She wrote:\n\nThe romantic idea that the disease expresses the character is invariably extended to assert that the character causes the disease \u2014 because it has not expressed itself. Passion moves inward, striking and blighting the deepest cellular recesses.\n\nCoincidentally, this is the precise reason that the term \u201cmental health\u201d was invented. Indeed, at the turn of the 20th century, medical professionals and those championing institutional reform of asylums hoped to reduce the stigma of \u201cmental illness\u201d by softening the language and its connotations. However, for obvious reasons (one being efficiency), the effort to describe depressed or psychotic individuals as having \u201cpoor mental health\u201d (as opposed to being \u201cmentally ill\u201d) did not easily catch on. Accordingly, there has been inconsistent usage ever since, so that describing the homeless schizophrenic as \u201cmentally ill\u201d may be tactful, while describing the autistic teenager this way \u2014 for example \u2014 comes across as an insult.\n\nThis is odd, certainly. And not least because \u201cthe risk architecture of autism may not be profoundly different from schizophrenia\u201d and since \u201cnew findings in schizophrenia and autism place these disorders squarely in the field of complex genetic disorders,\u201d according to Thomas Insel, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist and the director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Of course, Insel is \u2014 as scientists ought to be \u2014 extremely careful not to overstate the genetic component of these disorders. \u201cRecent progress is indeed a giant step forward for the field, but it is one step on a long journey,\u201d he says. \u201cComplex genetic disorders, by definition, will not yield a simple genetic test for diagnosis.\u201d Nevertheless, he also makes an interesting point about the language that lay people use to discuss mental disorders:\n\nWhat I\u2019ve been talking about so far is mental disorders, diseases of the mind. That\u2019s actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days. . . . For whatever reason, it\u2019s politically better to use the term \u201cbehavioral disorders\u201d and to talk about these as \u201cdisorders of behavior.\u201d Fair enough, they are disorders of behavior, and they are disorders of the mind. But what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms, which have been in play for a century or more, are actually now impediments to progress, that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe reason Insel seeks to shift the focus from behavior to brains is that behaviors, he says, are the symptoms. In focusing purely on symptoms, we neglect our duty for early detection and intervention, which \u2014 in the case of physical ailments \u2014 can be life-saving. Of course, not all mental disorders listed in DSM-5 have equal claim to being \u201cbrain disorders.\u201d Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), for instance, is widely overdiagnosed, while other disorders, such as gender dysphoria (formerly gender-identity disorder), can be significantly influenced by social contagion.\n\nIndeed, one of the greatest challenges in the field of psychiatry has been that research into the genetics of psychiatry has been \u2014 until very recently \u2014 largely unfruitful. Nevertheless, of late, there have been some promising (if minor) developments. For instance, in a study entitled \u201cPatches of Disorganization in the Neocortex of Children with Autism,\u201d in the New England Journal of Medicine, medical researchers compared \u2014 brace yourself, it\u2019s science \u2014 \u201cfresh-frozen\u201d brain tissue from dead autistic children with tissue from a control group of dead children without autism. They found some striking brain abnormalities in the autistic cohort and noted that these abnormalities seem to have begun in utero. So we might say with relative confidence (relative only to the complete dearth of research that came before) that even by Szasz\u2019s definition, autism is, indeed, an illness.\n\nBut does that mean we should describe people with autism as \u201cmentally ill\u201d? Possibly not. It is, of course, tempting to dismiss all such evolutions in modern language as \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d In my view, this is mistaken. Words that help or hinder the mentally vulnerable matter. For instance, the word \u201cretard,\u201d once commonplace, is now considered offensive. And good riddance. As we move toward a kinder, gentler world, psychiatric terminology will inevitably keep pace \u2014 Szasz was right that psychiatry has an unavoidable political dimension. But psychiatry must, must, must remain wary of malign political and ideological influence (please see gender dysphoria).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, common sense and decency require that we respond in good faith when we do think that someone has used the \u201cwrong\u201d word. Because this stuff is tricky, folks.
