A brilliant but ageing hitman finds himself being ruthlessly hunted down by a younger, fitter cloned version of himself?\n\nWow! I mean, it\u2019s Looper meets Jason Bourne, isn\u2019t it? RoboCop crossed with Universal Soldier.\n\nUp on the big screen, however, there\u2019s nothing remotely \u2018high concept\u2019 about this deeply disappointing Will Smith thriller. It\u2019s all decidedly \u2018low road\u2019 when it comes to the delivery, with most of the budget apparently blown on visual effects that allow Smith to be digitally \u2018de-aged\u2019 by 30 years to play his younger self.\n\nIt\u2019s all decidedly \u2018low road\u2019 when it comes to the delivery, with most of the budget apparently blown on visual effects that allow Will Smith (above) to be digitally \u2018de-aged\u2019 by 30 years\n\nYes, the Fresh Prince \u2013 Smith\u2019s alter ego from the Eighties and Nineties \u2013 is magically back.\n\nThe problems all start with the decision of director Ang Lee to shoot the whole thing in something called high-frame-rate 3D. That\u2019s essentially the same technology that made Peter Jackson\u2019s first instalment of The Hobbit look like cheap television, and the same format Lee used for his last film, Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk.\n\nBut that was a commercial disaster, and it will require all Smith\u2019s legendary clout at the box office to avoid this going the same way.\n\nMary Elizabeth Winstead (above with Smith) is decent enough as the pretty but, these days, far-too-young- to-be-the-romantic-interest former DIA agent who comes along for the ride\n\nBecause if The Hobbit looked like cheap TV, the higher frame rate that Lee uses here has an even more damaging effect.\n\nYes, the clarity is astonishing and the 3D top-notch, but the overall effect is almost too real. The magic of the big screen \u2013 the cinematic style and artifice, if you like \u2013 is rudely stripped away, leaving us with something where you can almost see the acting going on.\n\nThe visuals are so real that anything fake \u2013 like pretending to be someone you\u2019re not, ie acting, or digitally created \u2018visual\u2019 effects \u2013 stand out a mile. Proponents of the new technology say our visual expectations of what a film is supposed to look like will gradually change, and they may conceivably be right.\n\nSmith is actually better playing his deadly younger self, Junior, than he is as Henry Brogan, a middle-aged assassin whose conscience is catching up with him after 72 kills\n\nIf they are, a whole new style of film acting is going to need to evolve too. But until it does, I\u2019d play safe and go and see this in normal 2D if you can.\n\nEven then, you\u2019re unlikely to be particularly impressed. This, after all, is a story idea that has been around since 1997, when the notion of a cloned hitman was still fresh and new.\n\nMore than two decades and umpteen clone- featuring films later, that\u2019s definitely no longer the case.\n\nEven so, the screenplay \u2013 written by a three-man team that includes Game Of Thrones co-creator David Benioff \u2013 is astonishingly lacklustre. Characterisation is minimal and big moments, such as when Smith\u2019s character finally discovers he\u2019s fighting his own clone, are tossed away in an entirely pedestrian manner.\n\nIT'S A FACT Like Arnie's 'I'll be back' catchphrase, Will Smith manages to get the line 'Aw hell, no!' into all his movies.\n\nLee, whose genre-hopping glory days of Sense And Sensibility, Life Of Pi and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are beginning to feel a long time ago, should have spotted the problem but fails to act.\n\nWhether you see it in 3D or 2D, this is a film that always feels flat.\n\nSmith is actually better playing his deadly younger self, Junior, than he is as Henry Brogan, a middle-aged assassin whose conscience is catching up with him after 72 kills. \u2018I find myself avoiding mirrors these days,\u2019 he growls predictably.\n\nBut when the 73rd hit goes horribly wrong, his plans for retirement have to be put on hold, as he finds himself being pursued first by the Defense Intelligence Agency and then by the mysterious Gemini Corporation, run by the reliably sinister Clive Owen.\n\nMary Elizabeth Winstead is decent enough as the pretty but, these days, far-too-young- to-be-the-romantic-interest former DIA agent who comes along for the ride and even gets her own fight scene.\n\nBut like far too much here, in a film that even has recent echoes of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, it feels as if we\u2019re just going through the film-making motions \u2013 and not very convincing motions at that.\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nAbominable (U)\n\nRating:\n\nEarly on, it\u2019s difficult to get past the fact that, for a cartoon story set in China, all the young characters have semi-Westernised features and talk with American accents. But slowly the strange magic of this box-office hit begins to shine through, as Yi, a sassy but resourceful teenager still mourning her father, befriends a young yeti struggling to return to his family home on Mount Everest.\n\nSoon, Yi and Everest \u2013 as she calls him \u2013 and two cousins embark on a journey across China, pursued by an explorer who wants to add the yeti to his zoological collection.\n\nYi and Everest \u2013 as she calls him \u2013 (above right) and two cousins embark on a journey across China, pursued by an explorer who wants to add the yeti to his zoological collection\n\nEddie Izzard has a high old time voicing him, while younger ones will love Everest\u2019s funny wide face and unexpected magical powers.\n\nAmerican Woman (15)\n\nRating:\n\nSienna Miller is outstanding in this gritty celebration of American indomitability. She plays Debra, a working-class woman who is a grandmother by her early 30s, can\u2019t meet a decent guy, and whose life could fall apart when her 17-year-old daughter goes missing.\n\nBut Debra doesn\u2019t do falling apart\u2026\n\nThe Day Shall Come (15)\n\nRating:\n\nChris Morris had a critical triumph with Four Lions, which somehow found comedy in British jihadis. Now he turns his satirical attentions to an FBI obsessed with homeland security that has realised it\u2019s easier to produce its own terrorists than catch real ones.\n\nAn eccentric religious group \u2013 led by the not very bright Moses (March\u00e1nt Davis) \u2013 is the perfect opportunity. A convoluted film that is funny but never quite nails its target.\n\nFarming (18)\n\nRating:\n\nThe title refers to the practice of Nigerian parents placing their children with white working- class British families. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who writes, directs and experienced such \u2018farming\u2019 first-hand, delivers a searing account of the racism these youngsters encountered, before getting horribly bogged down in an over-extended skinhead drama that deserves a film of its own.", "description": "On paper, Gemini Man sounds like exactly the sort of film that is often described as 'high concept'.", "authors": ["Matthew Bond For Event Magazine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/12/19536344-0-image-a-13_1570706692437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
