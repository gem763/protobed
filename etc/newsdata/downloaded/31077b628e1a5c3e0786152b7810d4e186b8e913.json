Lauer is shown, right, at the Games\n\nThat paragraph from Lauer's letter reads: 'Anyone who knows me will tell you I am a very private person. I had no desire to write this, but I had no choice. The details I have written about here open deep wounds for my family. But they also lead to the truth. For two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations. They have avoided having to look a boyfriend, husband, or a child in the eye and say, ''I cheated.'' They have done enormous damage in the process. And I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.'\n\nTo that Zinone said: 'Anyone who knows me will tell you I am a very private person.'\n\nZinone continued: 'I had no desire to come out of the shadows from the pain his abuse of power inflicted on me in NBC's newsroom. I never had, nor do I have, anything to gain in telling my truth. In fact, I have everything to lose, but when I realized I was not alone, I was willing to lift the veil on that time to validate the accusations of others. I felt it was the right thing to do.'\n\nIn December 2017, Zinone opened up to the public about her extramarital affair with Lauer in July 2000 when she sought career advice from him at a lunch meeting that ultimately led to his quest to lure her in for sex.\n\nShe was a 24-year-old intern-turned PA, while he was the 42-year-old face of NBC.\n\n'Even though my situation with Matt was consensual, I ultimately felt like a victim because of the power dynamic,' she said at the time. 'He went after the most vulnerable and the least powerful - and those were the production assistants and the interns.'\n\nRead Addie Zinone's full statment Anyone who knows me will tell you I am a very private person. I had no desire to come out of the shadows from the pain his abuse of power inflicted on me in NBC's newsroom. I never had, nor do I have, anything to gain in telling my truth. In fact, I have everything to lose, but when I realized I was not alone, I was willing to lift the veil on that time to validate the accusations of others. I felt it was the right thing to do. I already lived with reporters from the National Enquirer hounding me over the years; I was not going to give them that power again. No one wants to be known for these issues, but after this story broke in Nov 2017, I decided I would no longer provide him the safety of my 17 years of silence, no matter the personal cost (which has been great, evidenced by every comment section under stories of my experience with him). Please do not confuse my willingness to speak up, however, with fearlessness. I'm petrified and humiliated that the world knows the intimate details of this experience. That said, here are the facts: I was a single 24-year-old intern-turned-production assistant; he was a married 42-year-old man, the most powerful and successful man at NBC, arguably in all of journalism. The trajectory of my life and career changed drastically as a result of this experience. I have never given false allegations when it comes to this story. To suggest I haven't been honest is a deflection, meant to ruin my credibility and reputation. I did look my (now) husband in the eyes and tell him about my participation in what happened all those years ago, and they have been horrible, guilt-ridden conversations. My children had to find out about it when they Googled my name and found words like \u201cslut\u201d and \u201cwhore\u201d instead of the philanthropy and military service I proudly pursued in 2002 in addition to my journalism career. Mr. Lauer's attempts to slut-shame and rewrite history will not work. It is troubling he has no understanding of, or empathy for, the pain he has inflicted with his brazen and predatory abuse of power on young, vulnerable women who had no voice. But now we do. I have always admitted my part in this - I deeply wish I had been stronger - but he knows it should not have happened. It was wrong - full stop. It cost him his career; his reputation. He will live with that forever. To be sure, so will we. Journalists are tasked with exposing this behavior, not perpetuating it. Power corrupts and he is not immune. I am thankful for the opportunity to move the conversation forward and uncover the truth with assistance from courageous journalists like Ronan Farrow. We rise above our individual experiences and focus on the need to create systemic change through education, training, dialogue and helping the most vulnerable, so that what I experienced, no one will ever have to again.\n\nIn 2017, Nevils reported Lauer for allegedly sexually assaulting her one night during the Olympics and it was her allegation that led to him being fired.\n\nNevils was in Russia for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics with Lauer and Meredith Vieira where she claims he anally raped her.\n\nIt was reported at the time but now Nevils has agreed to be named and is speaking on the record to share more details of the alleged rape in Ronan Farrow's new book, Catch and Kill.\n\nShe claimed that Lauer - who was married at the time - pushed her onto a bed and had anal sex with her despite her telling him she did not want to after a night of drinking in Sochi.\n\nShe said they were in his hotel room and he was wearing boxers and a t-shirt. Among other things, she said she 'wept silently into a pillow' while he had sex with her and that it 'hurt'.\n\nBrooke Nevils released a statement Wednesday night slamming Matt Lauer for 'victim shaming' her after she claimed he anally raped her\n\nLauer hit back in a three-page, 1,400 word response on Wednesday, saying that while they did have anal sex, it was consensual. He went into graphic detail about the Sochi incident and described others - including having sex in his Today dressing room - and called Nevils a 'willing partner'.\n\nTo his letter, Nevils released a statement of her own, saying: 'There's a Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades. And there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence,' the statement reads.\n\n'His open letter was a case study in victim blaming.\n\n'I am not afraid of him now regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would and now has tried to use against me.'\n\nShe added that she provided 'dates, times, evidence of communications and corroborating accounts' which 'both NBC and Farrow found credible'.\n\n'I continued to engage with him, as many victims of acquaintance rape do, particularly in the work place.\n\n'The shame in this story belongs to him,' Nevils said.", "description": "Addie Zinone - who opened up in 2017 about her own extramarital affair with Matt Lauer - slammed Lauer's open letter on Thursday.
