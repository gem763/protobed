According to Senior US economist, Gary Hufbauer explained on a macro-economic level, \u201cBy prohibiting investment in Chinese companies, Trump could inadvertently strengthen the dollar and cause interest rates to fall further. If forced out from China, investors might park their funds in US Treasuries.\u201d He also added, \u201cIf he were to do that, there would be questions as to whether he\u2019s setting a precedent for other countries he doesn\u2019t like\u201d\n\nHufbauer was slightly concerned that President Trump could do the same with Europe and Airbus.\n\nWe then had CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, who supports the notion of blocking US investments in China, who tweeted:\n\nWhether the action is good or bad for the economy, the charts couldn\u2019t care less. In fact, one thing I know is that the Dow Jones chart is showing major upside to come.\n\nThis Upside-Down Triangle could strike a + 15.98% whammy for the Dow Jones\n\nDow Jones - chart\n\nLooking at the weekly chart of the Dow Jones, you can see since 22 January 2018 the price has moved in a triangular shape, what I call an \u2018Upside-down Triangle\u2019 pattern. This pattern has three characteristics (which you can see above):\n\n1. A high price (Top of the triangle)2. A Low price (Bottom of the triangle)3.\n\nA preceding uptrend\n\nOnce the price breaks above the high price we can expect the buying pressure and demand to continue which will once again push the market higher\u2026\n\nIn this case, we saw a breakout above the high last month. This tells me, despite what is going on in China and the US, this chart is set to fly to new highs.\n\nTo calculate its next target, we\u2019ll take the difference between the high and low price and add it to the high price.\n\nTarget = (High - Low) + High\n\n= (26,675 - 22,410) + 26,675\n\n= 30,940\n\nThis means we can expect the Dow Jones to head up next to 30,940.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Timon Rossolimos covering: .
