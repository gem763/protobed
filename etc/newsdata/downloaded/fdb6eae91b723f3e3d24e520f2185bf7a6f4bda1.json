Salvatore Di Nolfi/Pool via REUTERS\n\nIn Russia\u2019s strongest criticism since Turkey launched its military operation last week, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s envoy for Syria indicated Moscow wanted Ankara to wrap up its offensive soon.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t agree with the Turks any questions about their presence in Syria and we don\u2019t approve of their actions,\u201d envoy Alexander Lavrentiev told reporters in Abu Dhabi during an official visit there by Putin.\n\nHe said Turkish troops had the right under an agreement struck between Damascus and Ankara in 1998, the Adana pact, to temporarily push up to a maximum of 10 km (6 miles) into Syria to conduct counter-terrorism operations.\n\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t give them (Turkish troops) the right to remain on Syrian territory permanently and we are opposed to Turkish troops staying on Syrian territory permanently,\u201d he said.\n\nLavrentiev made his comments as Turkey pressed ahead with its offensive in northern Syria despite U.S. sanctions and growing calls for it to stop, while Syria\u2019s Russia-backed army moved on the key city of Manbij that was abandoned by U.S. forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said late on Tuesday that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had phoned Putin. The Russian leader had used the call to complain about the humanitarian situation on the Turkish-Syrian border and had stressed the need to avoid a clash between Turkish and Syrian forces, it said.\n\nPutin had told Erdogan that the situation whereby Islamic State prisoners being held in custody by Syrian Kurds were exploiting the chaos by trying to escape was unacceptable, the Kremlin said.\n\nPutin had also invited Erdogan to visit Russia in the coming days for urgent talks, a proposal Ankara had accepted, it added.\n\nLavrentiev, Putin\u2019s Syria envoy, earlier on Tuesday told Russian news agencies that Moscow had always considered any kind of Turkish military operation on Syrian territory unacceptable.\n\nHis comments, which suggest growing tensions between Turkey and Russia, came a day after the Kremlin complained that Turkey\u2019s incursion was \u201cnot exactly\u201d compatible with Syrian territorial integrity.\n\n\u201cThe security of the Turkish-Syrian border must be ensured by the deployment of Syrian government troops along its entire length,\u201d said Lavrentiev. \u201cThat\u2019s why we never spoke in favor or supported the idea of Turkish units (being deployed there) let alone the armed Syrian opposition.\u201d\n\nLavrentiev said Turkey\u2019s actions risked upsetting delicate religious sensitivities in northern Syria.\n\nIn particular, he said the area was populated by Kurds, Arabs and Sunnis who would not take kindly to their lands being resettled by people who had never lived there, a reference to Turkey\u2019s plan to house refugees from other parts of Syria there.\n\nLavrentiev confirmed that Russia had brokered an agreement between the Syrian government and Kurdish forces that saw the Kurds cede control of territory to Syrian troops.\n\nThose talks had taken place at Russia\u2019s Hmeimim air base in Syria among other places, he said.\n\nRussia\u2019s influence in Syria and the Middle East is widely seen to have been boosted in the last week thanks to Washington scaling back its Syria operation and the Syrian Kurds striking a deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Moscow\u2019s closest ally in the region.\n\nLavrentiev said Moscow was hoping that the United States would withdraw all of its forces from Syria. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke to his U.S. counterpart about Syria on Tuesday evening.\n\nRussian military police are patrolling the line of contact between Syrian and Turkish government troops.\n\nLavrentiev estimated there were around 12,000 Islamic State prisoners being held in northeast Syria.", "description": "Russia called Turkey's military incursion into northeast Syria \"unacceptable\" and said on Tuesday the operation had to be limited in time and scale, a rare broadside that suggests Moscow's patience with Ankara is wearing thin.", "authors": ["Olesya Astakhova", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441222884&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0XX", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
