Each evening, families would tune into their channel of choice and take in the day's news as a list of trustworthy facts.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, those facts would be updated or corrected as need be. It was a simpler time to navigate the world and be confident in what you knew.\n\nContrast that scenario with today's constant and unending digital churn of news and opinion that updates minute to minute.\n\nReporting and editorializing bleed into each other, sometimes bolstering each other, sometimes cancelling each other out. Original sources of information are often hard to figure out. It makes for a loud, chaotic, and often stupefying landscape.\n\n\"The Truth\" has always been contested territory. We know that one person's version of the same event will differ from another's. There's perspective, and bias, and slant.\n\nBut what about the other kind of truth \u2013 the verifiable kind we call facts? Even the notion of verifiability has become slippery.\n\nIn all of this, journalists are still trying to do what they've always done: report the facts. But how does one do that in a time when the relationship between fact and truth is stretched so thinly that even a gentle pull could rupture it all together?\n\n\n\nGuests in this episode:\n\nDaniel Dale is the Washington bureau chief for The Toronto Star, and the author of the Trump Fact Check project.\n\nCarlin Romano teaches philosophy and media theory at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nLindsay Fitzgerald is a documentary filmmaker.\n\nAmanda Rogers is a visiting assistant professor of humanities at Colgate University.\n\n\n\nWeb Extra | Listen to the full interviews in this episode\n\nCarlin Romano is professor of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania. 34:44 Daniel Dale is the Washington bureau chief for The Toronto Star. 14:36 Lindsay Fitzgerald is a documentary filmmaker. 22:06 Amanda Rogers is visiting assistant professor of humanities at Colgate University. 55:52\n\n\n\nFurther reading and more on this topic:\n\n\u200b\n\n**This episode was produced by Naheed Mustafa.", "description": "While the idea that we're living in a post-truth era is still highly contested, there is greater agreement that facts themselves have also become contestable.
