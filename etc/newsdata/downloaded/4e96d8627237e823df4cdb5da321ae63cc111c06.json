And Dollar Tree and Dollar General have plans to open 20,000 more.\n\nThe problem is more acute in some cities than others, per a report from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that opposes concentrated economic power.\n\nConsider Birmingham, where close to 70% of city residents live in food deserts and the 2 dollar giants have opened more than 40 locations in the last decade. Since 2005, 5 Birmingham supermarkets \u2014 undercut by the cheap chains \u2014 have closed, and the city has struggled to get new grocers to come to town, the report notes.\n\nNow Birmingham has passed a pair of laws: The city is banning new dollar stores from setting up shop within a mile of an existing location and it's financing the opening of new supermarkets.\n\nNortheast Oklahoma City was confronted with the problem of dollar stores after its last grocery store closed in July.\n\nThe city has now prohibited new dollar stores from opening within a mile of old ones unless the store commits to saving 500 square feet of floor space for fresh produce.\n\nThe other side:\n\nA Dollar General spokesperson told Axios: \"We are disappointed a small number of policymakers have chosen to limit our ability to serve their constituents and communities.\"\n\n\"Our stores provide an affordable and convenient fill-in shopping option for our customers in between their weekly or bi-weekly grocery store trips, all while creating more jobs and investing in the communities we serve,\" a Dollar Tree spokesperson said.\n\nThe bottom line: The backlash against dollar stores is here \u2014 and spreading. More cities, from small ones like Hutchinson, Kansas, to big metros like Cleveland and Fort Worth, are considering laws to limit the chains.", "description": "There are about 30,000 dollar stores in the U.S. today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/L4zoQD2VAwBPZd5ph7MM7oaRF-Q=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/02/1570017262413.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
