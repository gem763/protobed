It is also five years since the two countries formed the China-Venezuela Integral Strategic Association, which aims to closen cooperation between the two far-left regimes.\n\n\u201cWe have made great progress in these friendly relations, cooperations based on respect and success shared,\u201d said Li, adding that the two countries have become \u201cgood friends with mutual trust and strong strategic partners of bilateral cooperation and shared success at a moment we are in a world of great uncertainty, there is also hegemonism, bullying, and unilateralism.\u201d\n\nLi\u2019s comments regarding bullying and unilateralism were a reiteration of Beijing\u2019s opposition to economic sanctions imposed by the United States against the Maduro dictatorship for its gross human rights abuses against its people, including the imprisonment, torture, and extrajudicial killing of political dissidents.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that the Venezuelan people are able to maintain peace and development stability, we strongly support it and we also believe that the issue of the situation in Venezuela can be resolved peacefully and negotiations within the framework of the Constitution and the Laws,\u201d he said.\n\nChina has become a key backer of the Venezuelan regime in recent years, providing it with financial and diplomatic support as well as humanitarian assistance. However, there have been occasional signs of strain on the relationship over the Maduro regime\u2019s inability to pay off its debts, most of which come in the form of cut-price oil payments.\n\nSpeaking at a similar event to mark 45 years of diplomatic relations between Venezuela and China, the regime\u2019s Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez declared that China, Russia, and Iran had become the \u201cnew north\u201d of Venezuela\u2019s foreign policy, effectively meaning they take their cues from those three countries.\n\n\u201cChina-Venezuela relations had a very special momentum with Commander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez who oversaw a new world of justice and peace,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said at the time. \u201cChina, Russia, and Iran are the new north of Venezuela\u2019s diplomatic relations.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The Chinese ambassador to Venezuela hailed the \"great advances of socialism\" at an event on Monday at a Chinese National Day event.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Li-Baorong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
