(AP) - A federal judge has denied a request by Missouri to allow a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy to go into effect while the state waits for further court action.\n\nThe Kansas Star reports that U.S. District Court Judge Howard Sachs had previously paused parts of Missouri\u2019s new abortion law. It was set to go into effect Aug. 28 and criminalizes abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIt also triggered bans at 14, 18 and 20 weeks if the initial eight-week ban was found unconstitutional.\n\nThe judge issued a preliminary injunction Aug. 27 against the bans based on gestational age. The state immediately appealed the judge\u2019s decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. It\u2019s not clear when the appellate court will hear the case.\n\nMissouri asked Sachs to reinstate just the 20-week abortion ban during the appeal.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge has denied a request by Missouri to allow a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy to go into effect while the state waits for further court action.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
