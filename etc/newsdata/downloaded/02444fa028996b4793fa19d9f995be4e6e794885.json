Expecting nothing in return, the die-hard fan shared photos of her decked-out hospital room on Instagram, which were later spotted by Taylor Swift herself.\n\nOsteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that is particularly common among people under 25 years of age. Although the survival rate starts at 70%, once it has spread to other parts of the body, this drops to about 30%. Unfortunately, Trinity\u2019s cancer has spread to her lungs.\n\nTaylor, who is well-known for her generosity, left a $10,000 donation on Foster\u2019s GoFundMe page with a heart-felt message to her avid supporter.\n\n\u201cTrinity, I saw photos of your album release party that you did in your hospital room and wanted to say thank you for being so kind and supportive! I hope I can give you a hug in person soon, but in the meantime I wanted to send you this and all my love. Your friend, Taylor.\u201d\n\nSince Swift\u2019s donation, a string of fans have rallied around Trinity\u2019s campaign, bringing her just a few hundred dollars short of her $15,000 target.\n\nFoster shared a screenshot of Swift\u2019s generous donation on Instagram with the following caption.\n\n\u201cOMG DREAMS REALLY DO COME TRUE ???????????????????????????? thank you guys so much for tagging her and actually getting it noticed, I love every single one of u.\u201d\n\nCompletely unaware that Swift would ever see her party, Foster decked out her hospital suite with glitter, balloons and streamers to bring some joy to her otherwise unfortunate circumstances.\n\nTrinity\u2019s cancer has spread to her lungs, and the 16-year-old now requires a feeding tube to get adequate nutrition. She is currently receiving treatment at East Tennessee Children\u2019s Hospital, where she has spent a majority of this year. She has three rounds of chemotherapy remaining and is expected to be finished treatment in October, according to Fox8.\n\nHer campaign has been shared at least 775 times, largely as a result of Swift\u2019s generous support.\n\nShout out to Taylor Swift for being a charitable queen. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen her donating to worthy causes, and it probably won\u2019t be the last. But this $10,000 will make a world of difference to Trinity\u2019s life, and it\u2019s so nice to see a celebrity giving back to fans like this.
