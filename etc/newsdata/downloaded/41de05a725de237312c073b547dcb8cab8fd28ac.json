(AP) - Environmental groups are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over storm water contamination downstream of Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nThe groups claim the runoff contains heavy metals, byproducts from decaying radioactive elements and manmade chemicals known as PCBs. They say some of the pollutants are more than 10,000 times public safety limits and should be considered a threat to public health.\n\nIn a complaint filed late Monday, the groups say the pollution should have triggered federal action to reduce or eliminate discharges through permit requirements but that the EPA failed to act.\n\nThe groups say the federal agency has not responded to previous petitions and letters asking that the pollution be addressed. They first threatened legal action in June , saying they would sue over violations of the Clean Water Act.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Environmental groups are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over storm water contamination downstream of Los Alamos National Laboratory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
