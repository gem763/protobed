Who couldn\u2019t have seen this coming? In a speech to law enforcement in Chicago, Donald Trump blasted both the House impeachment effort and Jussie Smollett as \u201cscams,\u201d drawing laughter and applause. Trump also called both \u201chate crimes,\u201d referencing Smollett\u2019s bizarre claim that his alleged attackers had claimed to be from \u201cMAGA Country\u201d in the heart of the Chicago Democratic machine:\n\nTrump also peppered the comparison and his view of Chicago\u2019s crime status with lots of criticism for police superintendent Eddie Johnson, who announced a boycott of the speech yesterday:\n\nWhile reveling in the weekend death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, President Donald Trump used a law enforcement speech Monday to blast Chicago\u2019s police superintendent, the actor Jussie Smollett, and Democrats seeking his impeachment. Attacking Smollett\u2019s unfounded allegations of an assault he blamed on Trump supporters, the president told the International Association of Police Chiefs: \u201cThat\u2019s a hate crime, it\u2019s a scam \u2013 just like the impeachment of your president is a scam.\u201d Trump also took after Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who skipped the president\u2019s speech to the police chiefs\u2019 group over his immigration policy. Describing Johnson\u2019s comments as \u201cinsulting,\u201d Trump blamed Chicago\u2019s high crime rate on Johnson and said he should have attended the chiefs\u2019 meeting because \u201cmaybe he could learn something.\u201d \u201cI want Eddie Johnson to change his values and change them fast,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe irony here is that Johnson\u2019s an ally of Trump when it comes to Smollett. Johnson has vociferously and angrily attacked both Smollett and the local prosecutor who let him slide without even a substantial wrist slap. Johnson held a press conference with then-mayor Rahm Emanuel to call Smollett\u2019s claims a hoax and to call into question the integrity of the city\u2019s state attorney, Kim Foxx.\n\nNot that it matters. Trump\u2019s using Smollett as a foil for commentary on impeachment, not the other way around. While he\u2019s having fun with the hyperbole \u2014 how can impeachment be a \u201chate crime\u201d? \u2014 his audience appears to be having more fun with the comparison and the local reference. \u201cSmollett is still trying to get away with it,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cHe would have been better off if he paid his $100,000 bill.\u201d\n\nThe speech wasn\u2019t all a defense on impeachment. Trump took a victory lap on the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, arguing that \u201canother president should\u2019ve gotten him \u2026 years ago.\u201d That may be a fair point, but it\u2019s also fair to point out that Trump\u2019s only a couple of months away from his three-year anniversary in office. If it was that easy, why not do this in 2017?", "description": "\u201cIt is a scam. A real big scam.
