To date, they are the fastest ants ever recorded.\n\nTo reach equivalent speeds, a six-foot-fall human would have to run 197.5 metres in a single second, or roughly 711 kilometres per hour.\n\n\"That's nothing even athletes can achieve,\" senior author Harald Wolf, who studies the neurobiology of arthropods, told As It Happens host Carol Off.\n\nThe findings were published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.\n\n'They're galloping'\n\nTo record the speeds, the researchers headed to the desert outside the village of Douz, tracked down silver ant nests in the sand, lured them with scraps of cookie crumbs, and filmed them with a high-speed camera.\n\nWolf says he and his colleagues were curious to learn why the Saharan silver moves faster than their larger cousins that inhabit Tunisia's salt pans, even though the bigger ant's legs are almost 20 per cent longer.\n\nTheir speed, Wolf says, appears to be related to how they run \u2014 and the environment they run in.\n\nUlm university researchers created a race track in the sand to measure the speed of Saharan silver ants. (Dr. Sarah Pfeffer/Ulm University )\n\nThe silver ants do their speed-runs in the hot midday sun on sand that can reach up to 70 C.\n\n\"They are scavengers and they feed on a dead arthropods, the insects and spiders. And, of course, during the hottest hours of the day, there will be the most dead insects, \" Wolf said. \"So that is their niche for foraging.\"\n\nIn part, they are protected by their silvery coats, which helps deflect the heat. But the way they scamper across the sand may also be a factor, Wolf said.\n\n\"They're galloping,\" he said. \"They use three of their six legs, all of them at one point in time, and then they change to the other set of three.\"\n\nIn between launching off one trio of legs and landing on the other, the ants are fully in the air with no feet on the hot sand, giving them a very long stride, he said.\n\nBut Wolf says the most interesting thing about the Saharan ants isn't their speed. It's the mystery of how they navigate their complicated desert journeys \u2014 something he and his colleagues have been studying for years.\n\nThe ants emerge from their nests \"in the middle of nowhere,\" he said, wander up to 100 metres away in search of food, and when they find it, return straight back to their nests.\n\n\"So how can they navigate in that way?\" he said. \"That is really the main research project. And on the side, we came across how these animals achieve those high walking speeds.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear.
