REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Saturday that while it was seeking a political agreement with the Taliban, Washington would not accept just any deal after a wave of violence cast a shadow over its talks with the insurgent group.\n\nAfghan leaders including President Ashraf Ghani have been increasingly critical of the apparent draft deal reached between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives in Doha this week as the violence has escalated.\n\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 view is that the best way forward is a political agreement and that (is what) we\u2019re working diligently on right now, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll take any deal,\u201d Esper said during a press conference in Paris with his French counterpart.\n\n\u201cWe will make sure we have a good deal, a good enough deal that guarantees at least the security of our countries going forward and a brighter path ahead for the Afghan people.\u201d\n\nUnder the draft accord with the Taliban, thousands of U.S. troops would be withdrawn over the coming months in exchange for guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States and its allies.\n\nHowever, according to the agreement, a full peace agreement to end more than 18 years of war would depend on subsequent \u201cintra Afghan\u201d talks. The Taliban have rejected calls for a ceasefire and instead stepped up operations across the country.\n\nOn Friday U.S. envoy Khalilzad was back in the Qatari capital Doha, along with General Scott Miller, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, to continue talks with the Taliban, who said the meeting had gone well.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s Tolo TV reported that the Afghan president had been due to visit Washington for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday only for his trip to be canceled at the last minute.\n\nThe United States ended its combat role in 2014, although 20,000 U.S. and NATO forces remain. They still train and support Afghan troops fighting the Taliban who fear being left vulnerable if the United States leaves.", "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Saturday that while it was seeking a political agreement with the Taliban, Washington would not accept just any deal after a wave of violence cast a shadow over its talks with the insurgent group.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427208714&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860C8", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
