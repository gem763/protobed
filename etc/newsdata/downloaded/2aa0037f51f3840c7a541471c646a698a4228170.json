Online sales so far are up by more than 11 per cent.\n\nNext recently partnered with Sir Philip Green's Arcadia fashion empire to sell its Topshop and Topman products on its website, where a wide range of third party brands are available.\n\nRuss Mould from AJ Bell praised Next for being 'slow and steady' and making 'small steps forward' despite the unfavourable market conditions.\n\n'The business is not fast growth like BooHoo, nor is it at the cutting edge of fashion like many other popular retailers.\n\n'But being slow and steady and providing functional clothing isn't a bad thing in the volatile world of retail,' he said.\n\nMould flagged, however, that Next's third-quarter performance is weaker than the first half of the year with high street declines accelerating.\n\nThat might go some way to explaining the drop in Next shares today to 6,691.92 per share.\n\nInvestors may also be nervous about the impact a December election could have on the wider retail industry during what is its most critical trading period.\n\nRichard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: 'The wider market remains under pressure and news of a general election just before Christmas couldn't come at a worse time for retailers.\n\n'Ongoing Brexit uncertainty and hostile political wrangling will further undermine consumer confidence with the risk of Christmas cheer evaporating as political debates heat up.'\n\nMould added: 'Next arguably needs people to feel good about their finances in order to spend money and any concerns about the economy, job safety and personal finances would naturally have a negative impact on retail spending.'\n\n", "description": "Shares in high street chain Next tripped up in early trading on Wednesday despite the company reporting a sales uplift for\u00a0the past three months.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
