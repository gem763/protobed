(Image: HBO)\n\nWho watches the Watchmen? The exact sort of people they don\u2019t really want watching them, it turns out.\n\nHBO just dropped a brand new trailer for Damon Lindelof\u2019s sequel-take on the seminal graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It, like our prior looks at the show \u2014 set in a world after the original comic, a world turned strange and even more grimly dystopian by Ozymandias\u2019 destruction of New York City \u2014 examines how, after eschewing masked vigilantism for decades, society has returned to embracing the mask... and not in great ways.\n\nMasks hide identities, they hide intents, they hide traumas. And this new trailer wants you to know that, as Regina King\u2019s Angela Abrahams takes on a vigilante identity of her own to hunt down a mysterious group of terrorists calling themselves the Kalvary, donning ink-blotted masks of their own akin to the one worn by Rorschach.\n\nIt\u2019s a gentle skewering of our own superhero fascination of the moment, as for all the cool costumes these self-made heroes and villains don, it can\u2019t help but all look deeply, deeply messed up. Which is the point, in the end.\n\nWatchmen comes to HBO on October 21, and will air on Fox Showcase in Australia.", "description": "Who watches the Watchmen?
