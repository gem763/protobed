He is due to appear in court there on Nov. 20, and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if he would be allowed to return home in the meantime.\n\nAttorney Michael Winkleman said in a statement that the child\u2019s death was \u201ca tragic accident,\u201d and that the family, who is from the northern Indiana community of Granger, will be filing a lawsuit against Royal Caribbean \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nWinkleman has said that Chloe fell through an open 11th-story window on July 7 after she had asked her grandfather to lift her up so she could bang on the glass in a children\u2019s play area. He\u2019s blamed the cruise ship operator for leaving the window open.\n\n\u201cThese criminal charges are pouring salt on the open wounds of this grieving family. Clearly this was a tragic accident and the family\u2019s singular goal remains for something like this to never happen again,\u201d Winkleman said in his news release.\n\n\u201cHad the cruise lines simply followed proper safety guidelines for windows, this accident likely would never have happened.\u201d", "description": "A judge has ordered Salvatore Anello's arrest for the death of 18-month-old Chloe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d24b9ef240000112093507d.png?cache=tvyn4lqy9y&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
