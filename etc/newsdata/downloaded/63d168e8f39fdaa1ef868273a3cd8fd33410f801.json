The reason is the Soli Radar chip used in the new phones.\n\nThe chip uses a 60 GHz ISM band which is not listed for commercial use in India as per National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP).\n\nThe company said in a statement it decided to not launch the phone in India based on various factors:\n\nGoogle has a wide range of products that we make available in different regions around the world. We determine availability based on a variety of factors, including local trends, and product features. We decided not to make Pixel 4 available in India. We remain committed to our current Pixel phones and look forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India.\n\nThe Soli chip enables various features on the device including face unlock and gestures. Without the sensor, those key features might not work as intended.\n\nThis means people in India will have to wait and see if Google releases the Pixel 4a, a cheaper variant of the flagship, to experience the phone\u2019s camera.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FScreenshot-2019-10-15-at-8.40.54-PM.png&signature=7639d0c2a9a11dbfdae0784abc25e824", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
