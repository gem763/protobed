You're reading the CBC Arts newsletter, and if you like what you see, stick around! Sign up here, and every Sunday we'll send you a fresh email packed with art, culture and a metric truckload of eye candy.\n\nHi, art lovers!\n\nGenerally speaking, walking around a convention centre is one extremely garbage way to spend a lunch break. (Give me windows or give me death.) But I'll make an exception for Art Toronto, which took place this weekend at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre \u2014 a monstrous concrete complex that happens to be conveniently located across the street from the office.\n\nActually, something like a third of the team's over there as I write this, scouting ideas for stories. (Over the years, we've wound up covering dozens of Canadian artists whose work we've discovered through the fair.) Aaaand...I'm starting to wish I was over there with them. Let's get moving on this newsletter!\n\nBecause we promised you eye candy\n\n(Instagram/@rajniperera)\n\nOn the subject of Art Toronto, the AGO made three acquisitions there Thursday night \u2014 including this brand new Rajni Perera piece. The mixed-media portrait is called Fresh Air.\n\n(Galerie D'Este)\n\nEarlier this week, one of the producers was swooning over V\u00e9ronique La Perri\u00e8re M.'s charcoal drawings. So, now I'm swooning over them. And maybe you're swooning over them, too. (Incidentally, you can find her work in Galerie D'Este's booth at Art Toronto.)\n\n( Instagram/@hannaleejoshi)\n\nThis Instagram is fire. (Love this post from Hanna Lee Joshi. She's at the ArtBreakers illustration market this weekend in Vancouver.)\n\n(Via Colossal)\n\nOK, I get it now. This is why people collect stamps. (Art by Elisabetta Di Maggio.)\n\nYou've got to see this\n\nBoys Don't Cry turns 20: Trans folks weigh in on the movie's complicated legacy - Back in 1999, it was a critical hit. Hilary Swank won the Oscar. The drama was praised as a pioneering LGBTQ film. But does it hold up today?\n\nSo you want to buy something at Art Toronto - Step 1: save your money. Step 2: read advice from a bunch of Canadian art dealers. Step 3: gift-wrap your purchase and send it to me c/o CBC Arts.\n\nExplore Vancouver with a hometown hero - Ken Lum stars in this week's episode of In the Making \u2014 but before you watch it on CBC Gem, go behind the scenes with director Chelsea McMullan. \"He's one of my heroes and meeting someone you deeply admire can be complicated,\" says Chelsea. \"But I quickly learned that although he has 'resting serious artist face,' he is so much fun!\"\n\nFollow this artist\n\n(Instagram/@agillianking)\n\nGillian King (@gillianking) - Ever thought of growing your own paints? Take this picture, for example. The colours you're seeing were made using things like onion skins and roses \u2014 and other plants that Gillian keeps in her \"dye garden.\" We paid her a visit in Ottawa. Watch.\n\nGot questions? Typo catches? Story ideas?\n\nWe're just an email away. Send us a note, and we'll do our best to get back to you.\n\nAnd if someone forwarded you this message and you like what you've read, here's where to subscribe for more.\n\nUntil next week!\n\nXOXO, CBC Arts", "description": "Try before you subscribe!
