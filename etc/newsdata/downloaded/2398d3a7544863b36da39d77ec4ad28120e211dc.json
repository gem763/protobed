He added that their nationality was yet to be confirmed.\n\nDetectives have been granted extra time to hold the lorry driver, Mo Robinson, on suspicion of murder.\n\nThree properties in Northern Ireland have been raided since the discovery of the bodies on Wednesday and the National Crime Agency is working to establish if organised crime groups were involved.\n\nPlay Video 1:49 Essex police bow heads as lorry containing 39 dead people is moved \u2013 video\n\nThe trailer was leased from one Irish company, the Monaghan-based Global Trailer Rental Europe, on 15 October to another business on the Irish border. It was the first time the second business had made such a leasing arrangement.\n\nSources have said that GPS data from the refrigerated unit shows that it left Monaghan on 15 October, before crossing into Northern Ireland, and then back south into the republic of Ireland.\n\nIt then travelled from Dublin port to Holyhead in north Wales overnight on 16 October, before crossing over to mainland Europe that evening.\n\nIt shows the trailer travelled to Dunkirk and Lille in France and Bruges. Dunkirk is 40 minute from Calais and is a known site for people-smugglers preying on migrants seeking to get across the English channel to the UK.\n\nThe data from the tracking device, which has been passed on to Essex police investigating the murders, also shows the trailer made two journeys between the UK and mainland Europe between October 17 and 22.\n\nThe data tracks the longitude and latitude of the trailer at all times and has been confirmed by sources.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, GTR Europe confirmed it was the owner of the refrigerated trailer but it said it was entirely unaware of what the lessee used it for.\n\n\u201cThe company has been in contact with police in Essex from early 23 October, immediately upon becoming aware that a trailer on lease from this company had been involved in this incident. Full details of the lessee have been given to the police,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nThe parents of the driver have been brought by police to England from their home in Northern Ireland to see him, the Guardian understands.\n\nMo Robinson, 25, a self-employed haulier from County Armagh, was detained after the bodies were discovered in the vehicle on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, magistrates in Basildon granted officers a warrant to hold him in custody for an additional 24 hours.\n\nTheir local councillor, Paul Berry, told Sky News: \u201cHis family are very well respected in the area and are very actively involved in community organisations.\n\n\u201cOur heart goes out to them because as of yesterday morning they were not aware that he had been arrested.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe community\u2019s thoughts and prayers are with the family of the 39 people who have lost their lives. People are devastated but also stunned and shocked that someone local has been arrested.\u201d", "description": "Truck in which 39 people died had made two trips between UK and continent in previous week", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Rory Carroll", "Henry Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbc34809c8a5cbd6ade5fc3488b75203b6c43dac/0_115_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7100c1e78af8b83f6dd6675643e0e42", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
