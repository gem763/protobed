Cole has the strikeouts and the incredible numbers, but Verlander has been the Houston Astros\u2019 anchor, the steadiest pitcher (and one of the most versatile) in the majors this year. He never allowed more than four runs in a start, and he pitched five or more innings in 33 of his 34 outings. In short, the Nationals shouldn\u2019t hope for an unexpected fifth-inning rally like they managed against Cole.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stakes of Game 2 at Minute Maid Park for the Astros are immense. If the Nationals win, they will have beaten the Astros\u2019 two top pitchers to seize another commanding 2-0 series lead headed back to Washington. If the Astros win, it rights the ship and gives them a little breathing room. The team knows it\u2019s at a disadvantage in Game 4 when it will oppose the Nationals\u2019 starter, probably Patrick Corbin, with its bullpen. Wednesday night is a crucial domino.\n\nThe Nationals turn to right-hander Stephen Strasburg, whose consistency this season, like Verlander\u2019s, was overshadowed by another ace\u2019s prolonged run of dominance. Strasburg will face an Astros lineup struggling not to put runners on base but to score them. Their postseason-long struggle to drive in runners in scoring position continued in Game 1 (they stranded 11 runners). Base runners are always important, but the dominance of the Game 2 starters increases the value of every opportunity to score.\n\nSome pitchers, such as Nationals ace Max Scherzer, judge a pitcher\u2019s performance on WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched). The metric measures traffic on the bases and attempts to provide a clearer picture of overall performance without untimely hits boosting stats like ERA. An elite WHIP is around 1.000; Strasburg was eighth in the majors this season at 1.038. Verlander led baseball with the third-lowest rate since 1900 (0.803).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is one of the best Game 2 pitching matchups in recent memory. But, as Game 1 showed, don\u2019t count out the offenses.\n\nAn\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez to start Game 3. Then things get interesting.\n\nThe Washington Nationals\u2019 radical pitching strategy is about to receive its first big test. The team has used its starters as relievers throughout the postseason and now, having deployed third starter Patrick Corbin in relief in Game 1, the approach has altered the team\u2019s rotation plans. An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez will now get the ball in Game 3, Manager Dave Martinez announced Wednesday, but he left his Game 4 starter unknown, presumably in case Corbin makes a relief appearance in Game 2 or 3 and then cannot start on Saturday.
