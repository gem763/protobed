He\u2019s also talking more on camera, and giving lengthier speeches at his rallies.\n\nCNN public editor and political fact-checker Daniel Dale drew on data from Factba.se, which tracks, transcribes and indexes everything that Trump says and posts. Its mission is not to debate or to characterize any of the president\u2019s comments, but rather to preserve a public archive to keep Americans informed.\n\nAnd this chart shows that Trump has averaged 83 tweets a week in 2019, which is a 43% increase from when he posted 58 tweets a week in 2018. It\u2019s a whopping 91% spike from the 44 tweets a week that he tapped out in 2017.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweeting is up 43% this year over last. His retweeting is up 326%. https://t.co/75Z3dQRRNo pic.twitter.com/h9ysCT0ZUu \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 21, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s retweeting even more, averaging 38 RTs a week this year, which is a 326% spike from about nine a week in 2018, and six a week in 2017.\n\nTrump is also expressing himself more IRL, as well. The data finds that his rally speeches have increased 26% from last year, now averaging at about one hour and 22 minutes, compared to one hour and five minutes last year, and just 59 minutes the year before. Indeed, seven of the 10 longest rally speeches of Trump\u2019s presidency were given this year \u2014 and Trump has only had 11 rallies so far in 2019.\n\nTrump\u2019s rally speeches are now an average of 20 minutes longer than they were earlier in his term.\n\n\n\nSeven of his last 11 rally speeches are in his top 10 longest. Just three of his previous 56 are in the top 10 longest. https://t.co/75Z3dQRRNo pic.twitter.com/HUBWHnzqLy \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 21, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s also chewing reporters\u2019 ears off more just before or just after his flights on Marine One or Air Force One. This \u201cchopper talk\u201d has averaged 12 minutes and 37 seconds this year, or a 78% increase over the chats that hovered around seven minutes and five seconds last year.\n\nAnd with the 2020 presidential election around the corner, Trump is also spending more time on camera. The POTUS averaged about two hours and 37 minutes a week speaking on the air through the second week of September 2019, or about 25 extra minutes talking on camera a week compared to the same time last year.\n\nThrough the second week of September, Trump was averaging 25 more minutes per week of on-camera speaking than he did through the same time last year, 55 more minutes than through the same time in 2017. https://t.co/75Z3dQRRNo pic.twitter.com/dCgnRF1PcD \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 21, 2019\n\nBut Dale suggests that it\u2019s not just the pending election that\u2019s spurring Trump to speak more publicly. Dale writes that, \u201cThe increases have come as Trump has rid himself of most of the advisers who reportedly tried to constrain his impulses, like chief of staff John Kelly and defense secretary James Mattis, and as he has appeared to become even more comfortable behaving as he wishes.
