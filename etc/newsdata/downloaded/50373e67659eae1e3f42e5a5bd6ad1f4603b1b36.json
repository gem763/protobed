(AP) - Shakers have long been known for the simple design of their furniture and household objects, but a new exhibit at the Currier Museum of Art explores their cutting-edge skills in brand management.\n\nThe Manchester museum is featuring a new exhibit called The Shakers and the Modern World, drawn from both its own collection and the holdings of Canterbury Shaker Village. Andrew Spahr, the museum\u2019s director of collections, says the Shakers at one time caused anxiety with attempts to convert outsiders to their religion, but then developed a branding strategy to counter negative public opinion and were quick to embrace printed media and photography to promote a more positive view.\n\nThe exhibit will be accompanied by public and educational programs developed with Canterbury Shaker Village, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shakers have long been known for the simple design of their furniture and household objects, but a new exhibit at the Currier Museum of Art explores their cutting-edge skills in brand management.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
