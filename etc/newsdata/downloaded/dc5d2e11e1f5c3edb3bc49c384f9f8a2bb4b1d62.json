Mr. McAfee, co-director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Initiative on the Digital Economy and a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, credits technological progress and capitalism.\n\nMany will find this conclusion, bizarre and hard to accept, Mr. McAfee acknowledges. Aren\u2019t these the same two forces that have caused the massive increase in the use of resources\u2014and environmental harm\u2014over the past two centuries? Haven\u2019t we been supporting our industrial-era prosperity by chopping down forests, digging out resources, killing animals and fouling our planet\u2019s air and water?\n\nWe sure have, but now that trend has reversed. And it's happened without radically reducing the trade-offs between human prosperity and the health of our planet. \u201cInstead, we just got a lot better at doing the things we\u2019d already been doing,\u201d he writes.\n\nCapitalism hasn't changed all that much. What has been radically transformed is the very nature of technological progress.\n\nMr. McAfee writes: \u201cWe invented the computer, the internet, and a suite of other digital technologies that let us dematerialize our consumption: over time they allowed us to consume more and more while taking less and less from the planet. This happened because digital technologies offered the cost savings that come from substituting bits for atoms, and the intense cost pressures of capitalism caused companies to accept this offer over and over.\u201d\n\nThe book is organized around asking and answering six key questions about the human condition, the state of nature and the relationship between the two. Let me briefly discuss each of the questions.\n\n\n\n1. What\u2019s the history of human prosperity and our relationship with our planet? Human prosperity and population growth are closely intertwined. The first period in this story was a very long stretch of very slow annual population growth\u2014well below 1%\u2014from prehistoric times until the early 1800s, when the population was around one billion.\n\nThe new technologies of the Industrial Era led to rising standards of living and major health-care improvements. Limits to growth and prosperity were significantly reduced. The world\u2019s population reached 2 billion in the late 1920s and 6 billion in 2000. Annual growth rates increased particularly fast in the 20th century, reaching a peak of around 2.1% in the 1960s before starting to systematically decline.\n\nHowever, the Industrial Era was hard on the planet. \u201cWe extracted ever-more resources from it, hunted many species to the brink of extinction or beyond, and greatly polluted the air, land and water,\u201d Mr. McAfee writes.\n\n2. What\u2019s happening now? The third population period is now unfolding, characterized by much slower growth rates. The global population is around 7.7 billion, with an annual growth rate of 1.1%. It is expected to peak toward the end of this century at roughly 11.2 billion with a growth rate of 0.1%.\n\nStandard of living, as measured by gross domestic product per capita, has been rising all over the world. But while prosperity has been steadily increasing, resource consumption has started to decline in most advanced economies, including the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe country now generally uses less metal, fertilizer, water, paper and timber, and energy year after year, even as output grows,\u201d he writes. The U.S. and other rich countries are now getting more for less.\n\n3. Why did things change? Dematerialization is mostly the result of technological progress and capitalism. Information technology, the internet, mobile devices and advanced technologies are enabling companies to do more with less. At the same time, the competitive pressures of global capitalism are forcing companies to embrace these technologies to increase revenues and profits while becoming more efficient and reducing costs\u2014that is, to do more with less.\n\n4. What are the consequences of this change? There\u2019s good news and bad news:\n\nOver the past several decades, the world has been getting quietly but relentlessly better . The improvements include increased life expectancy; declining poverty; reduced maternal and child mortality; better access to knowledge, education, food, clean water and sanitation.\n\nrelentlessly The improvements include While capitalism and technological progress let us do more with less, they\u2019ve also led to rising economic inequality.\n\ntechnological People are seeing a troubling decrease in our social interactions and relationships, resulting in increased depression and political polarization.\n\n5. What does the future hold? The trend is expected to deepen and broaden. In a decade, America is likely to be using fewer resources that it does now.\n\n6. What do we need to do differently? There are two urgent priorities: reduce greenhouse emissions and reverse the disconnections and declines in social capital that we see in so many communities. \u201cOur planet is getting hotter and we humans are getting colder; neither of these is a healthy trend,\" Mr. McAfee writes.\n\nIrving Wladawsky-Berger worked at IBM from 1970 to 2007, and has been a strategic adviser to Citigroup, HBO and Mastercard and a visiting professor at Imperial College.
