No peace and harmony ever when it comes to global trade, that is.\n\nThe Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s monthly fund manager survey released Tuesday revealed 43% of investors surveyed believe the U.S.-China trade war \u201cis the new normal versus 36% who think we will see a resolution before the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s that chart:\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to see investors getting jaded as the months go by without a deal \u2014 and they aren\u2019t alone.\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund predicted global growth will drop to 3% this year, the slowest pace since the 2008 global financial crisis, because import tariffs are strangling manufacturing activity and international trade.\n\nSpeaking in London Tuesday, St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard also said uncertainty about international trade policies is likely to linger for longer than markets anticipate. \u201cWe\u2019ve opened a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you study the history of trade negotiations, they\u2019re very long and very involved over a very long period of time.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of an all-out trade war has been the \u201cbiggest tail risk\u201d for fund managers surveyed by Bank of America since March 2018. That risk has only been replaced twice \u2014 in May 2018 when a Federal Reserve/ECB policy mistake became the biggest worry, and in March 2019 when a Chinese economic slowdown cropped up as the No. 1 risk. Here\u2019s that chart:\n\nA tail risk is an event that has a tiny chance of happening. The global financial crisis, which caused a global stock market meltdown, is one example of that.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s that tiny chance of good news? Here\u2019s another chart from the Bank of America survey that shows how a resolution to the trade war would be the most bullish event for stock markets over the next six months \u2014 by several miles:", "description": "The Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s monthly fund manager survey released Tuesday showed that 43% of those surveyed believe the U.S.-China trade war \u201cis the...", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT313_us_chi_ZG_20191015094452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
