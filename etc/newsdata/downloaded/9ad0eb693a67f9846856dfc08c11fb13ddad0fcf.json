Her teammate Li Maocuo took the silver medal in 4:26:40 and Eleonora Anna Giorgi of Italy finished third with a clocking of 4:29:13.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina's Li Maocuo celebrates after finishing second at the women's 50km race walk at the 2019 athletics world championships in Doha on Sunday.

So my goal was to finish the race first and then try to win a medal,\" she said.\n\n\"My coach told me to start slowly and use the ice. I think it helped me a lot.\"\n\nLiang achieved her career best time of 4:04:36 last year in Taicang where she collected both the team and individual titles at the IAAF World Race Walk Team Championships.
