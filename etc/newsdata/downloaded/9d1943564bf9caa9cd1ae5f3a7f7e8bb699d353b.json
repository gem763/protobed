There was criticism of the amount of foreigners when the squad was announced in August, and that has died down as the team has gone on an unprecedented winning run through its pool.\n\nThe win against Samoa last weekend drew a record TV audience in Japan of 46.1% on free-to-air Nippon Television. Local media said it was the most-watched sporting event of the year in Japan, surpassing Osaka\u2019s win in the Australian Open final. That mark was expected to be shattered on Sunday night, with the promise of a quarterfinal next weekend against two-time champion South Africa.\n\nFlyhalf Yu Tamura, the leading scorer in the tournament, was born to Japanese parents, along with winger Kenki Fukuoka, who has four tries in three matches.\n\nSeveral players are eligible for Japan because of rugby\u2019s three-year residency rule, including South Korean-born Jiwon Koo, New Zealand-born Luke Thompson, and Australia-born James Moore.\n\nCaptain Michael Leitch was born in New Zealand with Fijian heritage, but came to Japan to study when he was 15 and speaks Japanese better than English. He\u2019s the face of Japanese rugby, and his sponsors have placed him in media everywhere.\n\nWinger Kotaro Matsushima was born in South Africa to a Japanese mother and a Zimbabwean father.\n\nAnd Jamie Joseph - a former New Zealand forward - switched to play for Japan in 1999 and now coaches the Brave Blossoms.\n\nTo be fair, Scotland had several non-Scotland-born players.\n\nSome children in Japan with one non-Japanese parent have often been bullied and called \u201chafu\u201d from the English word \u201chalf.\u201d The demeaning term could fall out of use as more and more Japanese have a non-Japanese-born parent and immigrant roots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like all Japanese people to understand the changing of Japanese society,\u201d Itami said, with the Chinese characters meaning \u201cTo win\u201d painted on his right cheek. \u201cWe do not need to care if the blood is purely Japanese or not. If they understand the Japanese way, that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nHis wife had \u201cI Love Japan\u201d painted on her left cheek and was wearing a good-luck charm from a Shinto shrine.\n\n\u201cHonestly, many younger people - even Japan-born - sometimes do not understand our history or our culture,\u201d Imani said.\n\nJapanese Asuka Mitachi stood nearby, watching as women in kimonos and men in kilts passed by as she returned to her seat. Some Japanese women wore tartan plaid skirts, topped off by Japan\u2019s red and white jersey. Many carried fans that opened to reveal the word \u201cTry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very international team,\u201d Mitachi said. \u201cVery much the future. The future of Japan is international.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Like tennis star Naomi Osaka and NBA player Rui Hachimura, Japan's rugby team offers a diverse and slightly different look for an insular but changing country.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Wade"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_japan_scotland_91903_c0-199-4775-2984_s1200x700.jpg?f7153d43e13320695301934d053fae3243918311", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
