One of the boys of the house asked the grandmother to buy electricity, but she said she would in the morning and said he must sleep,\" he explained.\n\nThe 12-year-old boy apparently then lit a candle, he said.\n\n\"When the fire started, the family tried to help and break the windows, but they were too late.
