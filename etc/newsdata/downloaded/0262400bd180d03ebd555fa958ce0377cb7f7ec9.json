(AP) - Sage Surratt knows it\u2019s coming.\n\nAt some point Friday night, the Wake Forest receiver will set up for the snap and sneak a peek across the line of scrimmage to locate a certain linebacker eager to make a big hit: his brother, North Carolina\u2019s Chazz Surratt.\n\nIt will be the first time the former touted instate recruits meet on opposite teams. And that\u2019s added some sibling rivalry to an unusual nonconference game between Atlantic Coast Conference programs, not to mention an extra bit of stress for their mother at the likelihood the two will meet in a collision somewhere on the field.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s excited for the chance to hit me,\u201d Sage Surratt said Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the competitive person he is, regardless of who\u2019s out there. I think it\u2019s going to give him a little more juice when I\u2019m out there. It\u2019ll be fun, catching the ball or something and trying to make him miss. I like that idea.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a meeting the entire Surratt family knew was coming for several years after the brothers opted for different schools, though originally it seemed one would be on the sideline when the other was on the field considering Chazz arrived in Chapel Hill as a four-star quarterback.\n\nBut Mack Brown\u2019s return for a second stint as UNC\u2019s coach launched an offseason overhaul, which ultimately included Chazz moving to linebacker in the spring and changing the family dynamic running through Friday\u2019s meeting of 2-0 teams.\n\nChazz, a redshirt junior, thrived in his first game at linebacker with 12 tackles, a sack, a pass breakup and a pressure in the season-opening win against South Carolina, followed by five tackles in last weekend\u2019s win against Miami. Now he\u2019s part of a rotation charged with stopping an attack that features his brother, a redshirt sophomore who ranks as one of the ACC\u2019s leading receivers with 13 catches for 203 yards and two scores.\n\nAnd yes, there has been a bit of trash talk between them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try to lay him out if I can,\u201d Chazz said with a smile. \u201cMy teammates have been asking me if I\u2019m going to hit him or if I\u2019m going to go hard or not. \u2026 I think the first time I see him out there, I\u2019ll probably smile just because he\u2019s going to be like 10 yards away from me in the boundary. But once we get into the game, I think both of our competitiveness will take over and we\u2019ll be just trying to win and play hard.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment - well, the first part anyway - makes their mother, Brandi, a bit nervous. She said she had even told Chazz on a FaceTime call to \u201ctone down the joy and excitement in your face about hitting your brother\u201d after reading a recent article referencing his comments about tackling his younger brother.\n\nShe also knows that the loser of Friday\u2019s game won\u2019t hear the end of it anytime soon, either.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not envious of anyone else, they\u2019re not envious of each other,\u201d Brandi Surratt said. \u201cThey\u2019re very humble. But this, this is just bragging rights forever. \u2026 Whoever wins this game, we will never hear the end of this at home.\u201d\n\nBoth said they had their share of tough one-on-one basketball matchups, but they have never competed against each other in organized sports. Rather, they were teammates growing up, most notably when Chazz was the quarterback connecting with Sage as his top receiver at East Lincoln High School in Denver, roughly 30 miles north of Charlotte.\n\nBoth made The Associated Press all-state prep football team for North Carolina in 2015, with Chazz named the state offensive player of the year. A year later, Sage transferred to Lincolnton and swept the AP awards as state offensive player of the year in football and men\u2019s prep player of the year in basketball.\n\nBrandi Surratt said roughly 30 family members and friends are planning to attend Friday night\u2019s game and split up their seats, some in the Wake Forest home section and others in the UNC visiting section. The plan, she said, is for everyone to wear something representing both schools.\n\nAnd considering the teams won\u2019t meet again until 2021, this looks likely to be a one-time-only family get-together.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that this chance will ever come up again,\u201d Sage said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be fun to see.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball , http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sage Surratt knows it's coming.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aaron Beard"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/surratt_vs_surratt_football_38642_c0-76-1829-1142_s1770x1032.jpg?74c15ff2e6b269a43312ca5ba9b6a2408b46daed", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
