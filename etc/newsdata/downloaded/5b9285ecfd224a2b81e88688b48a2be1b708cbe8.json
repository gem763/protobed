President trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grilled and Pierre Thomas has the details. Good morning, Pierre. Reporter: Michael. Good morning. It was fireworks as for the first time a top trump campaign official was grilled at a public hearing about the Russia investigation and possible obstruction of justice. Democrats desperately trying to pursue impeachment proceedings and Republicans fiercely trying to protect the president. Throughout the roughly six-hour hearing, Corey Lewandowski could barely contain his apparent contempt for house Democrats. I think they hate this president more than they love their country. Reporter: Democrats continued to press about a key scene in the Mueller report. President trump calling Lewandowski into the oval office and dictating a message for delivery to Jeff sessions, the goal, to get the then attorney general to limit the special counsel's investigation. Didn't you think it was a little strange the president would sit down with you one-on-one and ask you to do something that you knew was against the law? I didn't think the president asked me to do anything illegal. Reporter: Democrats furious he refused to answer certain questions about his dealings with the president. Referring to this letter from the white house restricting the scope of his testimony citing executive privilege. You're not going to stonewall me. Reporter: Lewandowski's credibility put into question. I don't ever remember the president ever asking me to get involved with Jeff sessions or the department of justice in any way, shape or form. That was not true, was it? I have no obligation to be honest with the media because they're just as dishonest as anybody else. Reporter: It was a day of hardball politics. Lewandowski even took the time to tweet about a pact encouraging him to run for the U.S. Senate. George. We'll go to the white house\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Trump's former campaign manager was pressed by Democratic lawmakers about a key part of the Mueller report and testified that he has", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190918_gma_thomas1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
