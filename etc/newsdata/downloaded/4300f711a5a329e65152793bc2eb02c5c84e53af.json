Japan beat Ireland and Scotland in the group stages to top their pool. The nation of Japan have got behind the hosts who are expected to attract record viewing figures for this knockout clash after 50 million people watched the victory over Scotland on domestic television.\n\nThe Springboks have been dominant in all their matches since their opening defeat to New Zealand. South Africa are expected to rely on their huge pack and power game to overcome the Japanese. A contrast in styles certainly awaits as Japan's high-tempo game has proved too much to handle for defences in the tournament so far.\n\n\"We will definitely try to play the game at our pace, and they will try to play the game at their pace,\" said South Africa head coach Rassie Erasmus before the game.\n\n\"That will be a tactical battle, and it's tough for me to say now who will be able to enforce that.\n\n\"But that will be a really big battle from the coaching staff, and the 15 players on the field.\"\n\nSouth Africa beat Japan in a warm-up match before the World Cup in September. Japan head coach Jamie Joseph believes that has given his side extra insight into the opposition.\n\n\"The rehearsal in September, I'm calling it a rehearsal; that match was a warm-up game for South Africa and they'll find themselves in a unique position.\n\n\"I've renamed that Test match as a warm-up for South Africa and rehearsal for us and that's something that no other team in the World Cup quarter-finals have had and I think that's going to be a benefit for us.\n\n\"What is clear is what South Africa are going to do. It's clear because of their selection of extra forwards on the bench, it's not unique but shows they are physically going to approach the match using their forwards and being very physical.\n\n\"Consistency of their game around giving the opposition the ball and using defence and big forward pressure is a clear sign of intent and I guess that's what we've been preparing for all the way.\n\n\"What not so clear is what we're going to do and that's what I'm looking forward to.\"\n\nA historic game awaits in Tokyo.", "description": "South Africa has advanced to the semifinals with a grinding 26-3 win over Japan, bringing an end to the home team's entertaining run at the first Rugby World Cup staged in Asia.", "authors": ["Jake Goodwill", "Paul Hayward", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan", "Ben Coles", "Maggie Alphonsi", "Daniel Schofield"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213590284-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
