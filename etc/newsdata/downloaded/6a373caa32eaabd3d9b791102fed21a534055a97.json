In 2016, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was wrongly sentenced to five years for spying in Iran. While her husband returned to the UK to campaign for her release, their daughter, Gabriella, now five, lived with the maternal grandparents, visiting her mother weekly in prison. Now that Gabriella is back in Britain to start school, Richard Ratcliffe fears that his distraught wife will further deteriorate mentally and physically.\n\nWhile Zaghari-Ratcliffe is happy that the Australian government managed to secure the release from Iran of dual British-Australian citizen Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend, Mark Firkin, within months, she\u2019s increasingly desperate for freedom herself. What\u2019s the hold-up? The smart money is on a \u00a3400m arms debt, owed by Britain to Iran. It didn\u2019t help that, as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, the blundering idiot, said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was teaching journalism in Iran (she was on holiday).\n\nNow, even as Richard Ratcliffe hugs Gabriella and says: \u201cLet\u2019s hope that this homecoming unlocks another\u201d, there\u2019s the sense of an ordinary woman suspended helplessly in a geopolitical web that\u2019s more tangled by the second.\n\nMeanwhile, in August, 19-year-old Harry Dunn was riding his motorbike near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire when he was killed after colliding with a car allegedly driven by US diplomat\u2019s wife Anne Sacoolas, who then returned to America, claiming diplomatic immunity. Johnson requested that she return to Britain for questioning. However, Donald Trump\u2019s briefing notes were spotted at a press conference, saying that Sacoolas would not be returning. Not that Trump used these notes, preferring to ad-lib about how Americans sometimes drove on the wrong side of the road in Britain (\u201cit happens\u201d) and how they would \u201csee what we can come up with, so there can be some healing\u201d. Marvellous. Perhaps he is thinking of sending the Dunn family some crystals?\n\nDenouncing Trump\u2019s attitude as \u201coafish\u201d, the Dunns also called foreign secretary Dominic Raab\u2019s handling of their case \u201ccold and strange\u201d. Again, there\u2019s the sense of ordinary people trapped in a grotesque web, reliant on British representatives rendered powerless.\n\nOf course, these are two very different situations with no simple solutions. What they have in common is that both families have suffered appallingly, with Johnson\u2019s inadequacy placed centre stage. First, there was his fudging of the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case; now his supposed special relationship with Trump vanishes at the first sign of trouble. It wasn\u2019t even that Trump couldn\u2019t help \u2013 rather, that he couldn\u2019t care less about not helping, not even bothering to read from prepared notes. This should ring alarm bells for our future. Whatever the hard facts and cold realities of these specific cases, a broader message keeps hitting home \u2013 Britain has never mattered less\n\nThere\u2019ll be hell to pay if goths can\u2019t haunt graveyards\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Goths and graveyards: a marriage made in heaven. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA\n\nWith Halloween imminent, the question must be asked \u2013 what are the ethics of goth-proofing a graveyard? There\u2019s tension in the Cotswolds, where the vicar of Britain\u2019s \u201cmost haunted\u201d village, Prestbury in Gloucestershire, has banned tour operator Cotswold Ghost Tours from hosting walks in the graveyard.\n\nOne of the Rev Nick Bromfield\u2019s points is that he finds it unacceptable for hen parties and ghost hunters to be tramping through the graveyardabout, perhaps straying unwittingly close to new graves. However, I also feel sympathy for the tour operators trying to make the most of Prestbury\u2019s reputation, which includes tales of a ghostly horseman, hooves pounding for all eternity.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that a compromise can be reached. Vicars need to realise that graveyards often become chill-out zones for adolescents of the gloomier persuasion, wishing to gather to sip cheap, lukewarm alcohol from two-litre bottles and pretentiously discuss death. Yes, goths, and they have to go somewhere.\n\nThis is why all clergy should think twice before taking the radical step of goth removal. If they\u2019re not careful, they could be forced into public areas, with their crimped hair, charity shop cravats and Strongbow bottles, and locals would soon be fondly reminiscing about when trick or treat happened just once a year.\n\nStreaming? Forget it \u2013 HMV is the only gig in town\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest HMV boss Doug Putman: vinyl disciple. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/PA\n\nGood luck to the newly opened HMV \u201centertainment store\u201d in Birmingham, the biggest of its kind in Europe. Sunrise Records boss, Doug Putman, rescued 100 HMV stores in February and intends to defy online and streaming trends, offering 80,000 CDs and 25,000 vinyl albums in the Birmingham store, as well as film, TV, books, technology, merchandise and a stage for bands. Putman also promised that HMV would \u201cpay tax\u201d \u2013 take that, Amazon.\n\nCanadian Putman, a \u201cvinyl nut\u201d, seems to be the kind of customer he\u2019s trying to attract, which always helps. Certainly, he realises that it\u2019s key to create a sense of community among music lovers, making it not just about buying, but also about hanging out. For vinyl obsessives, this could also mean... vindication at last! A photo shows him grinning among the racks of vinyl and CDs, looking as though he\u2019s rummaging at an old-school record fair. As someone who, in her rock chick days, used to stagger and crunch in heels across a carpet of discarded records to get to the turntable, against a backdrop of horrified screams from more \u201cfastidious\u201d music lovers, I\u2019d be the first to admit this is not my world. However, Maybe I must belatedly concede that this is my loss.\n\nVinyl and CD heads have always been easy to stereotype: still dressing in band tour T-shirts long into middle age; perhaps prone to becoming a little over-excited at the discovery of limited edition, picture-disc \u201cwaxings\u201d with original inner sleeves. However, the direction taken by HMV indicates that they were right all along. Their formats of choice have not only survived, they have prospered. Moreover, their tastes have evolved into a viable mainstream business model \u2013 not only evoking the past, but also the future, maybe even the saviour of high street rock\u2019n\u2019roll.\n\n\u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist", "description": "Two very different cases highlight how impotent a power Britain has become", "authors": ["Barbara Ellen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf694d098b9b8736e0136df47a085f740eda057e/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2643e9e9ce38a1d4d8c62a77052aaef2", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
