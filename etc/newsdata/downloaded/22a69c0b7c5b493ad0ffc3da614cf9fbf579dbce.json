Ben Rushton\n\n\"It\u2019s a real credit to our stores that the team attitude measure in our voice of customer scores have remained stable throughout this challenging period,\" Ms Peters said.\n\n\"As we embed the new model, our customers will notice more team members on the shop floor, especially in key trading periods on weekends and after 6pm. These periods, which attract penalty rates, are when our customers want to shop and we\u2019re aligning our rosters to meet these changing needs.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is key to underpinning the long-term health of our business and the 115,000 Australian jobs it helps support,\" Ms Peters said.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Shaun Cousins estimates Woolworths will save $50 million a year through the new store operating model and roster changes, helping the retailer offset a $150 million increase in labour costs stemming from a new enterprise agreement.\n\n\"The benefits should all be in place in the second quarter and definitely by the second half,\" Mr Cousins said in a recent report.", "description": "Store management and roster changes will save Woolworths more than $50 million a year but have \"smashed\" staff morale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.219%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_81/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/24214ff5c260477891323c89c7686a612f551e4b", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
