(AP) - Mason Rudolph delivered two big plays in his first career start in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nRudolph and the rest of the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 offense couldn\u2019t do much of anything outside of those two long touchdowns and ended up losing a game the San Francisco 49ers kept trying to hand them.\n\nJames Conner lost a fumble with Pittsburgh protecting a lead late in the fourth quarter and the Steelers\u2019 opportunistic defense couldn\u2019t come up with a key late stop in a 24-20 loss on Sunday that sent the team to its second 0-3 start since 2000.\n\n\u201cA lot of mistakes,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be that slow-starting in the first half. I have to give our team and our defense more of a chance to put some points up early and get ahead with all of the turnovers they created. They played unbelievable. They did everything coach asked them through the week in creating turnovers and flying around. We have to back them up.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers\u2019 offense couldn\u2019t do enough. Pittsburgh settled for field goals after getting a pair of interceptions deep in San Francisco territory in the first quarter.\n\nThe offense then couldn\u2019t do much of anything outside of Rudolph\u2019s two deep strikes: a 76-yarder to JuJu Smith-Schuster in the third quarter that gave the Steelers a 13-10 lead, and a 39-yarder to rookie Diontae Johnson that made it 20-17 in the fourth.\n\nPittsburgh gained 126 yards the rest of the game, averaging just 2.6 yards per play to drop a third straight to open the season.\n\nRudolph finished 14 for 27 for 174 yards with an interception that set up San Francisco\u2019s first touchdown.\n\n\u201cFor a young guy to come and start his first game in an away game on the West Coast and going against a great team, I think he handled himself well,\u201d Smith-Schuster said. \u201cThere were situations where we messed up, didn\u2019t execute or turned the ball over, he stayed positive and kept us going.\u201d\n\nDespite all that went wrong on offense, the Steelers were still in position to win after the Niners committed their fifth turnover of the game - and third in the red zone - on a botched snap that gave Pittsburgh the ball with a three-point lead and 6:49 left to play.\n\nBut instead of burning the clock and backing up the 49ers, Conner lost a fumble on the third play of the drive, giving the 49ers the ball at the Pittsburgh 24.\n\nThe Steelers looked like they made the stop when they forced an incompletion on third-and-11 from the 14, but Mark Barron was called for a holding penalty.\n\n\u201cI just felt like the guy ran into me,\u201d he said. \u201cI just absorbed him. I didn\u2019t get my hands off him fast enough and that was the call.\u201d\n\nTwo plays later, Jimmy Garoppolo found Dante Pettis for a 5-yard score with 1:15 to play and the Steelers were on their way to their first loss in 38 years when generating five takeaways.\n\nBut Pittsburgh turned those gifts into six points, while the Niners got 14 after two giveaways by the Steelers.\n\n\u201cWe turned the ball over twice. They scored two touchdowns in the second half and really that\u2019s the difference in the game,\u201d coach Mike Tomlin said. \u201cIn the first half, we were getting turnovers and we were settling for field goals. So that\u2019s the story line of the game, if you will. Such is life in the National Football League. We take responsibility for it. We own it. Not good enough today. We won\u2019t blink.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers now must rebound and try to salvage the season with Roethlisberger out the rest of the way with an elbow injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mason Rudolph delivered two big plays in his first career start in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/steelers_49ers_football_37329_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
