Either way, Cramer continues, \u201cI think there is such a thing called Congress.\u201d The implication is even if the prairie populist by way of Massachusetts goes the distance, Wall Street\u2019s network on Capitol Hill would make mincemeat of her agenda.\n\nIn my interviews with members of Congress, especially Republicans, Warren\u2019s nomination is generally treated as a fait accompli. Perhaps it\u2019s projection, Warren is who many partisan Republicans think the Democrats are: female, lawyerly and anti-capitalist. The contest of Warren vs. Donald Trump would provide, if nothing else, clarity.\n\nThe dynamic extends past Northeast Washington. Where people put their money where their mouth is\u2014political gambling sites\u2014Warren\u2019s chances of winning the Democratic nomination are assessed at nearing 40 percent. On PredicitIt.com, one can buy a Warren share an absurd thirty-eight cents on the dollar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of Democrats nominating an aged, gaffe-prone white male popular with industry and in the Rust Belt seems absurd on the face: \u201cThat\u2019s our nominee, right?\u201d David Axelrod, mastermind of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said earlier this month while crowning Warren as the \u201cfront-runner.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with this line of thinking: it\u2019s not at all clear Warren is going to be the Democratic nominee for president. Her principal rival, Biden, the former vice president, still leads in some national polls. Biden is frequently compared to Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite, paper tiger on the Republican side in the last round.\n\nThere are two problems with this analogy. Biden isn\u2019t nearly as \u201cestablishment\u201d as the former Florida governor. Bush was the cash-flush son and brother of two presidents, while Biden is bleeding dough and has failed to procure the endorsement of the president he served. Conversely, unlike Bush, whose lead nationally evaporated by Labor Day, Biden has stubbornly stayed more or less at the top of the heap through all of 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s Halloween and Democratic voters haven\u2019t been spooked enough by the former vice president\u2019s at-times catastrophic performance to dump him. Unlike Bush, Biden has an ace in the hole: the anchoring constituency of his party, African-American voters. If Bush had commanded the acclaim of evangelical Christians he might have held on despite his other weaknesses as a candidate. Biden is also relatively popular, while the Bush clan is rightly still blamed for the destruction of American prestige at home and abroad.\n\nBiden frequently, even pathetically presents himself as an \u201cObama-Biden Democrat.\u201d ButBiden\u2019s candidacy remains most similar to a non-Bush 2016 candidate: Donald Trump, the front-runner the \u201csmart set\u201d claimed was doomed from the start. Like Trump, Biden is famous. And as Biden has hit campaign troubles, the former veep\u2019s raison d\u2019etre can take on an air of the self-evident: I\u2019m leading the race because I\u2019m leading the race.\n\nLike Trump, who would proudly spend literally hours of his campaign rallies reading off primary poll results, Biden also seems content to run a campaign based on his own lead. After weeks of purported political battering, Biden told 60 Minutes Sunday: \u201cI know I\u2019m the frontrunner.\u201d\n\nWith almost Trump-like flare, Biden noted: \u201cFind me a national poll with a notable\u2026a couple exceptions.\u201d What was true of the last Democratic debate, earlier this month in Ohio, may be true of the 2020 election as a whole. As Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of The National Interest, said: \u201cIt was a good night for the old codgers on stage.\u201d\n\nIndeed, insistences from career progressives and conservatives that Warren is the true Democratic standard-bearer can take on a mawkish tone. Surely, in a time of ubiquitous partisanship, the victors will be most ideological. The Democrats are moving ever left, the Republicans, ever right. Surely, it is time for a true believer.\n\nBut the logic is too clever by half. Templates are incomplete assessments of the world, but play along: if Trump is Biden\u2019s proper analogue, then Warren\u2019s candidacy is perhaps most akin to Ted Cruz\u2019s in 2016. Like Cruz, Warren is somewhat unpopular with her colleagues, which doubles as a badge of honor with many, more ideological activists.\n\nBut party activists perhaps understand the organization they serve less than they think they do. Isn\u2019t it just as possible, indeed maybe even likely, that Warren, like Cruz, is waiting for a day that will never come? Trump\u2019s \u201cimplosions\u201d were never reflected at the ballot box. Maybe so, it will also be with Biden.\n\nTemplates aren\u2019t perfect, however. While Cruz did well with evangelicals, Warren has failed to make inroads among African Americans. And unlike Cruz, the establishment has warmed to Warren\u2019s rise\u2014her campaign doubles as a Harvard satellite campus.\n\nBut perhaps Warren\u2019s greatest weakness as a candidate, as it was for Cruz, is that she is not the real voice of her party\u2019s discontented. A well placed source told me that in 2012 he advised Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, that the person who wins America\u2019s big elections today is the most pessimistic of the two messengers.\n\nOf the 2016 conservatives, Cruz was perhaps most polite to Trump, but in failing to ape the future president\u2019s program, he never emerged as anything more than a poor imitation of the real estate mogul. Immigration and ennui over America\u2019s international role were the orders of the day, and for a core contingent, no substitutes for Trumpian nationalism would do.\n\nWarren experiences this vulnerability, an intensity gap, not with Biden, but with Bernie Sanders. Warren, perhaps sensing the establishment\u2019s warmth to her, takes pains to emphasize that she is still a capitalist. Perhaps accordingly, socialist Alexandria Ocascio-Cortez, the most powerful millennial politician, has thrown in with Sanders, the candidate she volunteered for four years ago. For the under-forty set, which has been mired in a now-decade of low growth and the vice grip of rising housing, education and healthcare costs, Warrenism, like Cruzism, may come too little, too late.\n\nCurt Mills is senior writer at The American Conservative.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/warren-cruz.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
