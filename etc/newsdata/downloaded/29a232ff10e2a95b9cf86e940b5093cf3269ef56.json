but on Parliament's terms, not on the Prime Minister's.'\n\nAccording to The Observer, the parties' MPs have drawn up a bill that would allow Mr Johnson to secure a December election with a simple majority of MPs, by-passing the need for two-thirds support.\n\nThe draft law would grant an election on December 9 - three days before the PM's proposed date and, crucially, when more students are still at university to cast their votes in Remain-supporting target swing seats.\n\nThe move indicates a split between opposition leaders on whether to go for a December campaign, with Labour putting off their decision on how to vote on Monday.\n\nLeader Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to wait until EU ambassadors had finalised their decision, expected on Monday or Tuesday, over the length of an extension for Article 50.\n\nMr Corbyn, speaking on a campaign visit to Motherwell, North Lanarkshire on Saturday, said: 'We will be very happy to fight an election once all vestiges of a no-deal exit from the EU have been taken off the table.'\n\nBut the Government reiterated it had no intention of ruling out a cliff-edge divorce, with Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'No-deal can't be taken off the table.'", "description": "The Tories are up three points on 40 per cent, which Jeremy Corbyn's Labour remains stuck on 24 per cent as he continues to dither over Mr Johnson's offer of a pre-Christmas election.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/08/20237038-0-image-a-12_1572164699999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
