But many said the move was a case of \u201cadding fuel to the fire\u201d, as the following day, the streets in the city were filled with protesters defiantly covering their faces.\n\nMany chose to wear the Guy Fawkes mask from the 2005 film V for Vendetta. This isn\u2019t the first time the political thriller has been referenced by Hong Kong\u2019s protesters: many have taken to carrying cardboard signs that read quotes from the film such as \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people\u201d during marches, while \u201cV\u201d symbols can also be seen graffitied on walls around the city.\n\nWhat is it about this film that resonates so strongly with some protesters? We dig deeper into the movie to find out.\n\nStudents from different schools in Kowloon Tong hold a protest while wearing 'V for Vendetta' masks.

Cheng\n\nWho is Guy Fawkes?\n\nFawkes is a well-known figure in British history, thanks to his role in the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605.\n\nHe belonged to a group of Catholics in the country who did not like the Protestant king or government. They felt that they were being persecuted for their religion.\n\nThe group came up with a plan to blow up England\u2019s Houses of Parliament \u2013 the place where the country\u2019s lawmakers meet \u2013 and kill King James I on November 5.\n\nStudents react to face mask ban\n\nFawkes was in charge of setting off the gunpowder in an underground cellar beneath Parliament. But authorities were tipped off about the plan, and went to search the building. They found Fawkes guarding the explosives. He was questioned and tortured for days, until he finally confessed to the plot.\n\nEach year on November 5, people in Britain light bonfires and burn effigies of Fawkes to celebrate the King\u2019s lucky escape.\n\nMore recently, however, Fawkes has become a symbol of anarchism. V, the main character in V for Vendetta, embodies this symbol by wearing a Guy Fawkes mask.\n\nMany view the Guy Fawkes mask as a symbol of defiance.

It\u2019s completely unhelpful\u201d he said in an interview with IESB.net.\n\nStudents hold rally at HKU to condemn mask ban\n\nWhen asked to describe V, Weaving says he sees him as a very complex character. On one hand, he\u2019s a representation of the ideas that are at the heart of the film. But he\u2019s also a damaged person, someone who has been tortured by the government and is out to get revenge.\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s a very dark avenging angel if you like, or just a vengeful force,\u201d Weaving said. \u201cHe\u2019s also a force for hope and somebody that embodies this idea that the government should be responsive to the people that it represents.\u201d\n\nWhy does V never unmask himself?\n\n\u201cNormally, you\u2019d expect in a film like this \u2026 that the masked man will be revealed at some point,\u201d said Weaving in the IESB.net interview. \u201cBut he\u2019s not, for a very simple reason: the ideas are more important than the man, more important than the individual.\u201d\n\nWeaving\u2019s explanation echoes a quote from V in the original graphic novel by Alan Moore: \u201cBehind this mask there is more than just flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea \u2026 and ideas are bulletproof.\u201d\n\nOn Hennessy Road, one protester uses stencils to spray \u201cHong Kong\u201d and the V For Vendetta mask image in blue and yellow on the walls of an overpass.

In the original graphic novel, the character\u2019s last name was Susan, but the filmmakers changed it to Sutler to incorporate the name of another famous dictator: Hitler.\n\nThis historical connection felt all too real for actor John Hurt, who played Sutler in the film, as many of his scenes were shot on location in Berlin, Germany.\n\n\u201cIt was strange behaving like Hitler,\u201d Hurt said in an interview with entertainment website The A.V. Club. \"Some of the locations were exactly where he gave speeches.\u201d\n\nHow to talk to someone with different political views without getting nasty\n\nWhat is the significance of the character Evey?\n\nEvey, who is played by actor Natalie Portman, is a young woman who becomes radicalised by her personal experiences of suffering.\n\nHer mistreatment includes having her head shaved \u2013 an experience Portman agreed to undergo live on set to make the scene as realistic as possible.\n\n\u201cObviously, for the character, it\u2019s a very traumatic experience because it\u2019s a violence committed upon her,\u201d Portman said in a video interview in 2006, while promoting the film. \u201cBut for me, I got to choose to do it so I didn\u2019t feel like a violence against me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was actually kinda wonderful to throw vanity away for a little bit,\u201d she added.", "description": "The Guy Fawkes mask from the popular Hollywood film has been taken up as a worldwide symbol against repression", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/guyfawkes1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
