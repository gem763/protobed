He admits that power lifters have worked out in Converse for years but notes that he has started to see the style trickle into luxury and chain gyms. Much like the current popularity of barefoot running and weight lifting, Chucks are part of a more accessible, less-is-more approach to fitness. Both Tone House\u2019s director of training, Shaun Jenkins, and fitfluencer Anna Victoria tell us that they wear Converse when lifting, while trainer Jason Wimberly explains that the fitness community is taking a step back from super-technical sneakers in favor of more minimal styles. \u201cTrendy does not always mean better, and when it comes to choosing a training shoe that is right for you, I am always a fan of less is more,\u201d he says, noting that, in his 17 years as a trainer, he has seen many clients struggle with foot problems that are often a result of the wrong shoe. Workout sneakers that put the foot in an unrealistic position \u2014 either from too much cushioning or uneven stability \u2014 can create problems down the road, which is why All Stars have garnered a strong fan base among weight lifters, he says. \u201cWhile there is some benefit to cushy running shoes if you\u2019re going for distance, when it comes to weight training, it can actually hinder your lift,\u201d he adds. These have a solid flat sole that keeps feet as close to the ground as possible when squatting and lifting heavy weights; this helps prevent slipping, which can cause injuries.", "description": "We asked fitness experts to recommend the next status gym sneakers for men; their picks include sneakers from brands like On Running, Converse, Vans, NoBull, and Nike x Off-White.", "authors": ["Dominique Pariso"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/22/22-gym-sneakers.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
