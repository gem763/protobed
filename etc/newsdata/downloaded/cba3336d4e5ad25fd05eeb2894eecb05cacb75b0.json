Defensive stocks like food maker Nestle (NESN.EB) and drugmaker Roche (ROG.EB) declined.\n\nThe German DAX rose 0.11% to 12442.12, the French CAC 40 gained 0.09% to 5682.88 and the U.K. FTSE 100 weakened 0.12% to 7399.39.\n\nU.S. stock futures were higher after a 96-point gain for the Dow industrials on Monday.\n\nData released Tuesday showed the final reading of eurozone manufacturing PMI in September at its lowest level in seven years. Inflation also unexpectedly declined, to just 0.9% year-over-year, more than a full point below the European Central Bank's target.\n\nStrategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch say the Stoxx 600 can reach 415 by March, and that it expects cyclicals to outperform defenses by 5%.\n\nIt expects eurozone PMI momentum -- defined as the six-month change in the new orders component of manufacturing and services data -- to return to positive territory in the near term and remain there.\n\nLike J.P. Morgan on Monday (link), the strategists noted the rise in eurozone money supply, and the Bank of America team also the risk of a U.S. recession remain low.\n\nThe Bank of America strategists say European airlines in particular are priced for an outright eurozone recession.\n\nRyanair (RY4C.DB) climbed 4% and Air France-KLM (AF.FR) rose 2.5%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 05:42 ET (09:42 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
