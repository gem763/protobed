Just what would Scotty think?", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cBeam me up Scotty!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, sorry Captain, we cannae do that right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Scotty, we\u2019ve Klingons on one side of us and Romulans on the other. You. Need. To. Get us out of here quick.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWell, Captain, it\u2019s like this. We were supposed to have a smart meter fitted. You know, one of the fancy ones that actually works and lets you change suppliers. And, um, well, they brought the wrong one and we\u2019re running low on emergency credit. If we beam you up there\u2019ll be nothing left for life support.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Have you not contacted the helpline via subspace?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye Captain. Young Chekov\u2019s on with them now. He\u2019s been on hold for the last three light years and, um, Captain Kirk?\u2026 Captain Kirk?\u201d\n\nStar Trek tech is what we\u2019ve been promised when it comes to smart meters, at least by someone called Lord Duncan of Springbank, who bears the august title of Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Minister for Climate Change).\n\nIn that capacity, he boldly told a committee of MPs on Wednesday that the \u201cStar Trek phase\u201d of smart meters will allow residents to \u201crun the laundry\u201d when it\u2019s cheap to do so thanks to tariffs that allow for a change in energy costs every half hour or so. The problem is that there\u2019s been nothing Star Trek about smart meters, or the domestic energy market, to date.\n\nTheir rollout has looked more like something from the early days of Doctor Who when the sets were built out of cardboard leftovers from Blue Peter and held together with string along with the judicious application of glue.\n\nThe first iteration of that show was kept going for years by dint of fans\u2019 willingness to overlook the dodgy sets and second rate special effects because the stories were good.\n\nThere\u2019s been nothing much good about the smart meter story to date. Millions of pounds have been spent on marketing and half the country still doesn\u2019t know what the point is. They might be among the lucky ones. Some of the stories that have emerged from those who picked up on the meter messaging and then took the plunge have been positively nightmarish.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Some of them are even green, although that might just be the effect Boris Johnson has on them when he gets up to speak. He certainly turns me that colour.\n\nPart of the problem with the first generation of meters was that if you wanted to switch supplier \u2013 and switching should be encouraged to keep suppliers honest and prices competitive \u2013 they would go stupid.\n\nWe\u2019re told the new lot will be Trek-tastic but would you want to rely on that?\n\nA government target called for suppliers to have them in at least 85 per cent of customers\u2019 homes by the end of 2024. The original plan was for suppliers to take all reasonable steps to fit meters by the end of 2020. You can see where this is going, can\u2019t you? Maybe half of us will actually have one by 2020 and the cost of the rollout is soaring.\n\nIf you take the British government, add energy suppliers, and then put them in a blender what you end up with isn\u2019t very Trek. It\u2019s just very crap. So that\u2019s hardly a surprise.", "description": "\u201cBeam me up Scotty!\u201d \u201cAh, sorry Captain, we cannae do that right now.\u201d \u201cWhat?
