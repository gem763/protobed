(Photos: Getty Images)\n\nCostume contact lenses may take your Halloween costume to the next level, but they\u2019re riskier than you might think.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to assume these fashion lenses \u2014 which are often an impulse buy \u2014 are harmless, since you can find them at practically any Halloween costume shop or beauty supply store. But putting costume contact lenses in your eyes without seeing an eye-care professional first \u2014 yes, even lenses for a Halloween costume \u2014 can actually damage your vision.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) calls costume contacts \u201crisky,\u201d and notes: \u201cYou should never buy contact lenses from a street vendor, a beauty supply store, flea market, novelty store or Halloween store \u2014 and you should always have a prescription.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because contact lenses are considered medical devices that are regulated under federal law by the FDA. \u201cIf you buy lenses at a Halloween store, flea market, beauty supply stores, novelty shops, costume stores, there\u2019s a pretty good bet those lenses are illegal,\u201d Thomas Steinemann, MD, a cornea specialist and clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWhat the seller is doing is certainly illegal and the lenses likely have not passed inspection through the FDA. A lot of lenses from overseas are not very well made. They may be using dyes with additives. Some of those lenses are contaminated because they\u2019re black market. It\u2019s critically important that buyer beware.\u201d\n\nAlthough costume contact lenses, also known as fashion or decorative lenses, may say \u201cnon-prescription\u201d on the packaging, that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need a prescription to buy them (you do). \u201cThat means they\u2019re non-corrective \u2014 they don\u2019t correct vision,\u201d says Steinemann.\n\nEdward Manche, MD, a cornea specialist at the Stanford Eye Laser Center, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that, while you don\u2019t have to buy costume contact lenses from an ophthalmologist or optometrist, you do need to have your eyes measured by an eye-care professional to make sure the lenses fit you properly.\n\nAs Steinemann puts it: \u201cOne size does not fit all when it comes to contact lenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegular and cosmetic lenses need to be fit for your eye,\u201d Manche says. \u201cIf they\u2019re not, you can end up having complications. You can end up with a scratched cornea, which can cause painful, red eyes, but more seriously, it can lead to infection or corneal ulceration. You can end up having permanent impairment of vision or rare in cases, blindness.\u201d\n\nIf you spot any redness or experience pain or discharge from your eyes while wearing costume contact lenses, remove them immediately and contact your eye doctor.\n\nWhile it can seem like a hassle to see an ophthalmologist or optometrist to get a prescription for costume contact lenses, it can save you from \u201ca lot of trouble,\u201d says Steinemann. He adds: \u201cFrom one night of fun, you can potentially be opening up a can of worms that will affect you for the rest of your life. Do it the right way and do it safely.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Halloween contact lenses may look cool, but they're also risky.
