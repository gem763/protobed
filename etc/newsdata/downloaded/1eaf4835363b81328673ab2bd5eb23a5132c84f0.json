(Margo Sugarman)\n\nBaseball has changed in the 12 years it\u2019s been missing from the Olympics.\n\nIsrael, for starters, now has one of the world\u2019s best teams.\n\nAfter a surprise run at the 2017 World Baseball Classic \u2014 when a team full of American Jews knocked off world heavyweights South Korea, Taiwan and Cuba \u2014 Israel won a qualifying tournament last week to secure one of six Olympic berths at the 2020 Games, becoming the first team to join host Japan in the event.\n\n\u201cNext year in Tokyo!\u201d the public address announcer cried after the team recorded the final out of an 11-1 win over South Africa, playing off the traditional Jewish expression, \u201cNext year in Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nIn a change from the past, all 24 of the team\u2019s players have obtained Israeli citizenship and a number are contemplating making the country their home, at least part time. And a country of 8.7 million people with only 1,000 ballplayers, according to the Israel Association of Baseball, has gone crazy for the game, at least in some quarters.\n\n\u201cMy uncle who lives in Jerusalem is like a celebrity now,\u201d said pitcher Jon Moscot, a former Cincinnati Reds starter, in a phone interview. \u201cHe\u2019s getting calls from friends of friends. It\u2019s all over the news. He was beside himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last few days have been a whirlwind tour,\u201d said IAB President Peter Kurz.\n\nThere are limits, though. Outfielder Jeremy Wolf asked a cabdriver outside his Tel Aviv apartment if he\u2019d heard about the baseball team as he climbed into the back seat.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s baseball?\u201d the driver answered.\n\n[Iranian judo team suspended after athlete pressured to avoid fighting an Israeli]\n\nThe sport\u2019s boosters hope the national team\u2019s success and the spotlight from a first Olympic appearance will help the game blossom in the desert.\n\nAlready, Israeli baseball has attracted a number of MLB stars with name recognition. Current Detroit Tigers manager Brad Ausmus coached the team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Current Phillies manager Gabe Kapler and retired Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green were player-coaches. Dodgers outfielder Joc Pederson, at the time still a minor league prospect, played right field and batted second.\n\nIn the 2018 WBC, journeyman pitcher Jason Marquis led the starting rotation. Big league catcher Ryan Lavarnway was behind the plate. Former Mets and Pirates power-hitting first baseman Ike Davis batted third. Sam Fuld, a defensive specialist in an eight-year MLB career, played center field.\n\nKurz said he\u2019s tried to recruit perennial all-stars Ryan Braun and Alex Bregman, who are both Jewish.\n\n\n\nIsraeli's Daniel Valencia (19) celebrates at home plate with Mitchell Glasser in a win over South Africa. (Margo Sugarman)\n\n\u201cThe ballclub that I could build could definitely compete,\u201d he said.\n\nBaseball has been played in Israel since the 1980s, according to the IAB, but mostly in American expat communities. In a country roughly the size of New Jersey, there is only one full-blown baseball field, according to the IAB. When youth teams show up to soccer fields and try to set up bases for a game, soccer players sometimes shoo them away even if the baseball teams have the permits to use the field.\n\nBut when Major League Baseball began planning the 2013 World Baseball Classic, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred directed the IAB to try to field a team. Without many professional-caliber Israeli-born ballplayers to choose from, Kurz recruited American Jews for the team. The prospects were eligible to play under the WBC\u2019s \u201cheritage\u201d rule, which allows athletes to compete for a country if they were legally capable of gaining citizenship there. (Israel grants citizenship rights to all the world\u2019s Jews, as defined by the country\u2019s \u201cLaw of Return.\u201d)\n\nAfter scraping together a team that just missed WBC qualification in 2013, word spread among Jewish ballplayers in the U.S. that Israel was looking for players for the 2017 tournament.\n\n[A year into a rebuild, the Orioles have been shaken up and (they hope) straightened out]\n\nAhead of the competition, Kurz flew 10 of the players and their families to Israel for a \u201cnation-building\u201d trip. They toured the country, signed hundreds of autographs and held a public practice.\n\nBy the time of the 2017 WBC, they were the talk of the tournament. ESPN compared Israel\u2019s baseball team to the long shot Jamaican bobsled team. Disgruntled opponents after losses complained that they\u2019d faced the United States\u2019 junior varsity team, not Israel\u2019s national team.\n\nNonsense, said Shlomo Lipetz, a right-handed reliever and the team\u2019s only native-born Israeli.\n\n\u201cIsrael has this kind of history of Jews coming and going through the process of becoming Israelis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the identity of what Israel is. That\u2019s part of the culture.\u201d\n\nAnd in the lead up to the Olympics, where rules about \u201cheritage\u201d eligibility are tougher, all of the team\u2019s 24 players have gained Israeli citizenship, a process in Hebrew called \u201caliyah,\u201d or ascending.\n\n\n\nIsraeli pitcher Joseph Wagman throws in the game against South Africa. (Margo Sugarman)\n\n\u201cMy family was ecstatic about it. My dad was so proud that his son made aliyah,\u201d Moscot said. He plans to explore splitting time between the U.S., where he is a player-coach in the Reds farm system, and Israel after the Olympics.\n\nWolf already picked up and moved to Tel Aviv. He\u2019s the only member of the team to live in Israel full time. He moved into his apartment in the middle of the city\u2019s commercial district two days before heading to Germany for Olympic qualifying games.\n\n\u201cI was there on Birthright,\u201d he said, referring to a free trip to Israel for young adults, \u201cand I was with a bunch of my friends walking around Tel Aviv and I said, \u2018I could do this. I could live here.\u2019\u201d\n\nWolf founded the nonprofit More Than Baseball when he thought his playing days were over. The organization in the U.S. has been working with minor league players to defray the cost of living expenses while chasing their MLB dream.\n\n[He snagged a historic home run ball. Now it is in the Hall of Fame, in memory of his late son.]\n\nNow in Israel, Wolf and teammates say they have another purpose: To convince more Israeli kids to pick up a ball and bat. That starts with the Olympic team acting as role models for a generation that has never seen ballplayers wearing Stars of David on their uniforms.\n\nOn Friday nights while the team is away competing, the team gathers for shabbat dinner. When the Israeli national anthem plays before the start of a game, the players stand on the baseline with their ball caps off but \u201ckippot,\u201d skullcaps, still fastened in place. (Not all the players are religious, but they still wear the kippot.)\n\n\u201cI grew up with pictures of Sandy Koufax on my wall. He was my dad\u2019s favorite player. He would tell stories about him. I loved Shawn Green. Anyone who was Jewish made it real for me,\u201d Moscot said. \u201cBeing on this team means a lot. It\u2019s not just playing the game. You represent that deep heritage and culture and the feelings of that Jewish kid who wants to be an athlete one day.\u201d\n\nKurz said he hopes this moment will help the IAB fund two more fields in Israel and double the number of kids playing in recreational leagues.\n\n\u201cAs they say in baseball,\u201d he said, \u201cif you build it, they will come.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMeet the blind sports announcer whose mission is to make games more accessible\n\nBryce Harper fed up with taunts from Nationals fans: \u2018It\u2019s not right\u2019\n\nRussia\u2019s spot in the Tokyo Olympics is threatened amid new doping concerns\n\nUSA judo\u2019s Jack Hatton, an Olympic hopeful and \u2018true role model,\u2019 dies at 24", "description": "All 24 members of Israel's national team have gained Israeli citizenship in the run-up to the Olympics.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer", "September At Am", "Jacob Bogage Writes About Sports For The Post", "Where He Has Worked Since He Previously Covered The Automotive", "Manufacturing Industries For The Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7oY3E4zAihxm39e4iyoExvkSj4o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GYXPNHW76QI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
