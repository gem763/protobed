There are over 230 million major surgeries all around the world per year, according to experts at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Many of them require sutures to close the wound, which can actually cause stress on the tissues and can cause infections, pain, and scars. Medical glues, which have been used since the 1970s and were first used by the military, can take several minutes to seal tissue. One of the main chemicals used in medical adhesive can be toxic to humans, causing pain and inflammation around the area where it is used. Other surgical glues are made from water-based gels. These are less toxic, but do not bond with the same strength, doctors have said in the past.\n\nOne of the main chemicals used in medical adhesive can be toxic to humans, causing pain and inflammation around the area where it is used.\n\nOther surgical glues are made from water-based gels. These are less toxic, but do not bond with the same strength, doctors have said in the past.\n\nDr Zhao and colleagues have previously created gels proven to be tougher than the material barnacles use to cling to rocks.\n\nBut this time they turned their attention to a tape, in hope that it would prove better than stitches and even quicker than surgical glue.\n\nThe team took inspiration from spiders, which produce a glue that helps them capture their prey in wet conditions \u2013 similar to that of human tissue.\n\nPolysaccharides inside the glue almost instantly absorb water on an insect, making a small dry patch for the glue to stick to.\n\nThey were able to mimic this process by using polyacrylic acid, an absorbent material used in diapers. Inside the acid were chemicals known to create strong bonds.\n\nDepending on how the tape is being used, the engineers can control how fast it breaks down inside the body by varying the ingredients that go into it.\n\nGelatin tends to break down within a few days or weeks in the human body, while chitosan \u2013 found in insect shells \u2013 can last up to a year.\n\nThe double-sided tape can also be used to attach implantable medical devices to tissues, including the heart.\n\nTrials on rats showed the tape kept a patch stuck to their hearts for several days. But more tests are needed, the researchers said.", "description": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists proved the tape worked after they tested it on 'challenging' wounds on the lungs and intestines of rats and pigs.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20376576-0-image-a-31_1572442701008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
