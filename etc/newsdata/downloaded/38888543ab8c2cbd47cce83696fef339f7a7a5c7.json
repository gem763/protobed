The Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis has said she and her husband, Mark Gwynne, an investment banker, \u201cdon\u2019t see enough of each other\u201d. They have been married for 18 years, and because of their jobs, she said in an interview with Good Housekeeping, \u201cwe\u2019re like ships that pass in the night\u201d. But, she added, \u201cit works\u201d.\n\nHow much time do couples need to spend together for a healthy relationship? It depends on the couple, of course, says the relationship counsellor Silva Neves. \u201cWhat would be ideal for couples, especially if they have little time, would be to have meaningful contact first thing in the morning \u2013 that can be one full minute of a meaningful hug or kiss, because that really deepens intimacy. When people come home, do the same thing. If it\u2019s possible, send a few texts during the day, or even a heart or a kiss emoji. Those are small things that take very little time but make a difference in the connection of couples.\u201d\n\nIt becomes a problem, he says, \u201cwhen people start feeling taken for granted in the relationship. Someone might feel they are not being seen, or heard, any more. In today\u2019s world, everything is so fast and often people don\u2019t take time to be curious about their partners\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nIt can also be an issue if there is a shift in the relationship \u2013 if you go from seeing each other often to not very much, or the other way around. \u201cYou get used to what\u2019s normal for you, and some relationships start with always having long gaps,\u201d says Dee Holmes, a senior practice consultant for Relate. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can say there\u2019s a minimum [time together needed] because for some marriages in which people have quite a lot of time apart, that works for them, but it wouldn\u2019t work for everybody.\u201d Too much time together may also not be ideal. \u201cI think it is healthy to have time apart because it gives you other things to talk about, and when you come back together you appreciate each other more.\u201d But again, for some couples, being together all the time works.\n\nWhat matters, she says, is how well you communicate with your partner. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not physically together, if you\u2019re still communicating, that stops misunderstandings and people feeling rejected or alone. But you can\u2019t beat quality time together.\u201d She says scheduled couple time \u2013 such as Maitlis\u2019s Saturday night, when she is \u201calways at home\u201d \u2013 is important for the health of a relationship.\n\nBeing in the same place physically does not always mean it\u2019s quality time, she adds. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re having a good relationship if you\u2019re playing on your phone all night. It\u2019s about what you\u2019re doing in that time together more than anything.\u201d However much time that is.", "description": "Quality can be better than quantity \u2013 even if, like Emily Maitlis and her husband, you are like \u2018ships that pass in the night\u2019", "authors": ["Emine Saner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07311ba749e3052e700acf4d3136b36b298aac64/0_340_2984_1790/master/2984.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=675be723f134f0af0c558cdab0d636be"}
