The laureates receive them at an elegant ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of prize founder Alfred Nobel in 1896, together with five other Nobel winners. The sixth one, the peace prize, is handed out in Oslo, Norway on the same day.\n\nThis was the 113th Nobel Prize in Physics awarded since 1901, of which 47 awards have been given to a single laureate. Only three women have been awarded it so far: Marie Curie in 1903, Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1963 and Donna Strickland in 2018, according to the Nobel website.\n\nOn Monday, Americans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain\u2019s Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine, for discovering details of how the body\u2019s cells sense and react to low oxygen levels, providing a foothold for developing new treatments for anemia, cancer and other diseases.\n\nNobel, a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nThe Nobel Prize for Chemistry will be announced Wednesday, two Literature Prizes will be awarded on Thursday, and the Peace Prize comes Friday. This year will see two literature Prizes handed out because the one last year was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The Nobel Physics Prize was given to James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz for work in understanding how the universe has evolved", "authors": ["David Keyton"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/2019-nobel-physics-prize.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
