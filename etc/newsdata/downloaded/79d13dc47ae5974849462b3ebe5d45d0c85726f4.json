More\n\nOthers seem more flippant about it, simply commenting \"typical\" (not the first time a movie with sexual content is banned in Malaysia) and \"Knew it from looking at the trailers\". Some even joked that if the distributor didn't reveal the movie's true nature by previously posting sexy stills from the movie, it might have made it to the big screen after all.\n\nStarring Lopez as veteran stripper Ramona Vega, others who star alongside her include Constance Wu (\"Crazy Rich Asians\"), Julia Stiles (\"10 Things I Hate About You\"), Lili Reinhart (\"The Good Neighbor\"), Mercedes Ruehl (\"Zeyda and the Hitman\"), Lizzo (\"UglyDolls\"), Keke Palmer (\"Pimp\"), and rapper Cardi B.\n\nLopez's Vega mentors Wu's Destiny, a single mother who starts stripping to provide for her family, and the two eventually team up to steal from their strip club's wealthy clients.\n\nThe movie has been receiving rave reviews since its release in the US last weekend.
