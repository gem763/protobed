A day ago, crude marked the highest finish in a month after a key weekly inventory report showed a decline in U.S. crude supplies.\n\nDecember WTI crude CLZ19, +0.07% edged 12 cents, or 0.2%, lower at $55.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after jumping 2.7% on Wednesday.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude for December BRNZ19, +0.15%, meanwhile, slipped 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $61.11 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, after closing at the highest for the front-month contract finish since Sept. 27.\n\nA report from Germany reinforced the view of a global slowdown after the IHS Markit flash German manufacturing PMI inched up to 41.9 in October from September\u2019s decade-worst 41.7, which is still a reading that shows the factory segment of the country\u2019s economy in dire straits. Readings below 50 indicate contraction.\n\nOn top of that, the European Central Bank left its main deposit facility rate at negative 0.5% and its main lending rate at 0%. The rate-setting Governing Council repeated that it expects to keep rates at \u201cpresent or lower levels\u201d until inflation, which has remained stubbornly low, \u201crobustly\u201d converges with its target of near but just below 2%. It also reiterated that it will begin a controversial bond-buying program at a pace of 20 billion euros a month beginning in November.\n\n\u201cOil prices remained heavy after Germany\u2019s manufacturing downturn remains firmly in place despite a slight uptick from last month. The euro area is barely growing as a whole, and we should see that continue to put pressure on demand forecasts,\u201d wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at brokerage Oanda, in a daily research report.\n\n\u201cOil may struggle for a significant rally unless OPEC + deliver further queues that they will deepen production cuts in December or if we get a significant de-escalation in the US-China trade war,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in the week, markets bounced after reports indicated that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies would consider making further reductions to crude output when they meet in December because of growing concerns about a slowdown in growth for oil demand, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing sources from the oil-producing club.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude supplies fell for the first time in six weeks, down 1.7 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 18. Separately, supplies of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, fell by 1 million barrels for the week.\n\nCrude supplies were forecast to increase by 4.7 million barrels, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a rise of 4.45 million barrels.\n\nEarlier in the week, markets bounced after reports indicated that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies would consider making further reductions to crude output when they meet in December because of growing concerns about a slowdown in growth for oil demand, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing sources from the oil-producing club.", "description": "Oil futures head slightly lower on Thursday as investors wrestle with the outlook for crude demand amid slack in the global economy.", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS097_abqaiq_ZG_20190926074554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
