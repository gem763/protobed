Solid display.\n\nTyrone Mings 8\n\nDebut remembered for wrong reasons. Somehow kept going. Impressive.\n\nHarry Maguire 7\n\nLooked far more solid and maybe partnership with Mings is something to build on.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nBen Chilwell 7\n\nMobile and quick, if he can hone his defensive skills he will keep his place for a decade.\n\nHarry Winks 8\n\nExcellent. Set the tempo of the team, controlled midfield and must now get a run.\n\nJordan Henderson 6\n\nBooked. Lucky to only get a yellow card for late challenge, misses next game.\n\nRoss Barkley 9\n\nMotM. Two goals and a role in another, is Southgate\u2019s go-to man in midfield.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nRaheem Sterling 8\n\nSomehow he kept playing, stayed focused and was brilliant amid the abuse.\n\nMarcus Rashford 7\n\nWhat a goal - and what a way to mark your return. So dangerous from the left.\n\nHarry Kane 8\n\nA night for big characters - played well and, more importantly, did captain\u2019s job.\n\nSubs : Henderson, Pope, Alexander-Arnold, Keane, Gomez, Rice, Tomori, Mount, Wilson, Sancho, Abraham\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBulgaria\n\nIliev 5; Pashov 6, Terziev 6, Hadzhiev 6, Zanev 5; Despodov 5, Popov 6, Sarmov 5 (Kraev, 46, 6), Kostadinov 6, Farias 5; Isa 5 (Ivanov, 68, 6).\n\nSubs : Ivanov, Lozev, Dimitrov, Slavchev, Kraev, Mihaylov, Nedyalkov, Malinov, Nascimento da Costa, Ivanov, Goranov, Karagaren", "description": "England hit Bulgaria for six in Sofia with an impressive performance overshadowed by incidents off the pitch", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580723.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
