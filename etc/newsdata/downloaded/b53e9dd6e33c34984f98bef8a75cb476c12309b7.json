(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nPresident Donald Trump put regulatory reform at the top of his agenda and has done much to fulfill his promises in that regard. The Wall Street Journal notes the administration over the past three years has saved more than $40 billion in the regulatory arena. A report from the White House Council on Economic Advisers concludes that, over the next few years, the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory reforms will have increased U.S. real incomes by $3,100 per household per year.\n\nThis is an important achievement on more than just the economic front. The rise of the federal administrative state has transformed scores of executive agencies into a quasi-legislative branch of government that enjoys wide latitude to interpret law while imposing regulations on business and individual behavior. But by ceding so much rule-making (read: legislative) authority to unelected bureaucrats, this arrangement serves as a clear threat to the separation of powers concept embedded throughout the Constitution and intended to protect against the tyranny inherent in consolidated authority.\n\n\u201cThe administrative state has the power to enforce its laws, as it alone has interpreted them, liberated from any meaningful review by the courts and often from any meaningful control by the president,\u201d wrote Charles J. Cooper, who served in the AG\u2019s office under Ronald Reagan, in a 2015 essay for National Affairs. \u201cIt can truly be said that, in the main pursuits of everyday life, we are ruled by a one-branch government. And the \u2018experts\u2019 who run it are accountable to no one.\u201d\n\nIt will ultimately be up to Congress and the courts to reverse this dangerous trend. But Mr. Trump deserves credit for joining the battle.\n\nLast week, the president took another important step toward reining in the bureaucracy by issuing two executive orders meant to blunt a prominent tool agencies use to expand their domain: so-called \u201cguidance\u201d letters issued to intimidate entire sectors of the economy into bending at the whim of federal bureaucrats.\n\nRecall that the whole due process conundrum on campuses involving sexual assault is the result of a 2011 Department of Education \u201cguidance\u201d memo that pressured universities to lower the burden of proof in such cases. The same goes for relaxed disciplinary policies in many public schools \u2014 the result of similar \u201cguidance\u201d from federal education officials upset with racial disparities in school suspensions. In 2013, the Journal noted, another \u201cguidance\u201d letter from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau implied that auto lenders \u201ccould be liable for discrimination if their portfolios showed disparate racial impact.\u201d\n\nDozens more examples abound. But what all these directives have in common is that they were issued outside the rule-making process. \u201cThink of guidance as an off-the-books way for the government to ignore commonly held understandings of fairness,\u201d Michael P. Degrandis wrote for Reason.com last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a shameless, unconstitutional scheme designed to skirt judicial review, avoid public scrutiny and evade accountability.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, Mr. Degrandis points out, agencies \u201cuse guidance to avoid judicial review\u201d because the courts won\u2019t grant standing to sue until a regulation is final, \u201cbut courts don\u2019t typically view guidance as final agency action.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s executive orders, however, aim to right these wrongs. The first demands that every new \u201cguidance\u201d memorandum be posted online for the public to review. It must also declare that \u201cit does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as incorporated into a contract,\u201d the Journal reports. The intent is to ensure \u201cthat Americans are subject to only those binding rules imposed through duly enacted statutes or through regulations lawfully promulgated under them, and that Americans have fair notice of their obligations.\u201d\n\nThe second order ensures that Americans will not \u201cbe subjected to a civil administration enforcement action or adjudication absent prior public notice of both enforcing agency\u2019s jurisdiction over particular conduct and the legal standards applicable to that conduct.\u201d\n\nRuss Vought, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, put it succinctly. \u201cThese executive orders,\u201d he said, \u201cgive this administration the tools to defend Americans\u2019 freedom and liberty against off-the-book regulations and prevent unfair penalties from being levied on American families and business by rogue agencies.\u201d\n\nThere is, of course, a proper role for a regulatory bureaucracy in a democratic republic. But empowering it to operate largely unbound by the traditional checks and balances represents a very real danger. The president\u2019s orders are welcome and long overdue.", "description": "Donald Trump issues two executive orders that will help restore balance.", "authors": ["Las Vegas Review-Journal"], "top_image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12834569_web1_trumporderweb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
