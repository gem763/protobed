The Cougars finished eight wins better than Texas and five better than Texas A&M. With the newly minted College Football Playoff favoring Power Five conference teams, Houston \u2014 yes, this Houston \u2014 was the Group of Six team hungry for something more in the postseason.\n\nAD\n\nThat helped attract recruiting and transfer classes that included Justin Murphy, an offensive guard who played at Texas Tech and UCLA.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was really a no-nonsense decision,\u201d Murphy told KRIV Sports, the Houston Fox affiliate, when he announced the move. \u201cThe things that I\u2019ve seen of Coach Holgorsen at West Virginia led me to believe he\u2019s going to pick up right where he left off out there, and that\u2019s a winning team that\u2019s gonna compete for a championship including this year, which is all I have left.\u201d\n\nGuard/tackle Justin Murphy (@JMurphy_73) on (grad) transferring from UCLA (@UCLAFootball) to @UHCougarFB: \"It was really a no-nonsense decision.

His tweets came not long after quarterback D\u2019Eriq King and wide receiver Keith Corbin opted to redshirt.\n\n\u201cI came here to play football for the University of Houston and that\u2019s not changing,\u201d King said in a statement posted to the team\u2019s Twitter account at the time. \u201cAfter carefully thinking through this process with my family and Coach Holgorsen, I have decided the opportunity to redshirt this season gives me the best chance to develop as a player, earn my degree and set me up for the best success in the future. I\u2019m looking forward to being a part of the success of this program going forward.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this week, Murphy said Holgorsen told him not to travel with the team to North Texas for Houston\u2019s fifth game of the season to \u201cheal up mentally and physically,\u201d a decision Murphy considered a suspension.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCoach left practice that day stating, \u2018If you\u2019re not 100% committed to the team then don\u2019t get on the bus,\u2019\u201d Murphy tweeted. \u201cIronic in light of recent events.\u201d\n\nCoach left practice that day stating, \u201cIf you\u2019re not 100% committed to the team then don\u2019t get on the bus.\u201d Ironic in light of recent events. \u2014 Justin Murphy (@JMurphy_73) October 11, 2019\n\nWith every departure, Houston gets further away from that 13-win 2015-16 team. The Cougars have gone through two head coaches since then. Tom Herman left for Texas, and Houston fired Major Applewhite after two seasons.\n\nThe Cougars don\u2019t look much like a 2019 bowl team six weeks into the year and without the building blocks Holgorsen plans to build around in 2020. They\u2019ll need four wins in their last six games to qualify. Winning is another proposition entirely.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Cougars fell to Cincinnati, 38-23, and Houston looks further away from bowl eligibility than ever.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ysZ6l0fw4OEJcYp2G88NMRKx7p0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJLHJPGXH4I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
