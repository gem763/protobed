That can happen. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did.\n\n'When you get used to driving on our system and you're all of a sudden on the other system, where you're driving, it happens. You have to be careful.'\n\nLiberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna said: 'President Trump's comments are a disgrace - they do not show any understanding of the need for justice or the immense tragedy to the family in this case. His decision is totally unacceptable.\n\nCharlotte Graham, whose son Harry Dunn died six weeks ago, says she is 'disgusted' that Trump will not hand over alleged killer Anne Sacoolas, who hit him with her car while on the wrong side of the road\n\nMr Trump sparked uproar by appearing to defend Anne Sacoolas, who fled the UK after the death of Harry Dunn, 19, near an airbase in Northamptonshire in August, saying: 'It happens'\n\nAnne Sacoolas (right) allegedly hit 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry (left) with her Volvo SUV on August 27 outside a US spy station in Northamptonshire after driving on the wrong side of the road for up to 400 yards.\n\n'Harry's family deserve the justice and closure they need. Boris Johnson must do all he can to get Trump to think again and waive diplomatic immunity in this case.\n\n'If the shoe were on the other foot, a young man was killed in the US and a UK citizen suspect had fled the scene of the crime, the President would be threatening all kinds of action against the UK.\n\n'This is someone's life that has been taken. Johnson must not sit back and accept Trump's refusal. Anne Sacoolas needs to participate in the police investigation so that Harry's loved ones can get some answers.\n\n'The Conservative Government must not continue to let them down in their time of need.'\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the situation was 'completely unacceptable'.\n\nIn a speech this morning he vowed to put as much pressure as possible on the US, adding: 'If we could take legal action in the US we would do so.'\n\nLib Dem Chuka Umunna said: 'President Trump's comments are a disgrace - they do not show any understanding of the need for justice or the immense tragedy to the family in this case'\n\nRegarding Mr Trump, Labour MP Wes Streeting said: 'The Special Relationship between our two countries has been the cornerstone of our mutual defence and prosperity for nearly a century. President Trump continually undermines that relationship'\n\nSacoolas allegedly hit 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry with her Volvo SUV on August 27 outside a US spy station in Northamptonshire after driving on the wrong side of the road for up to 400 yards.\n\nDays later she was spirited from UK soil on a state-sponsored private jet from America's air base in Suffolk, RAF Mildenhall, protected by her husband Jonathan's diplomatic immunity.\n\nThe Uk has been making intensive diplomatic efforts to achieve her return to the UK, but so far without success.\n\nRegarding Mr Trump, Labour MP Wes Streeting said: 'These are crass and insensitive comments that will inflict further pain and suffering on a grieving family.\n\n'Mrs Sacoolas should return to the UK immediately to provide answers as to what happened to Harry Dunn.\n\n'The Special Relationship between our two countries has been the cornerstone of our mutual defence and prosperity for nearly a century. President Trump continually undermines that relationship.\n\n'The British people will side with Harry's family in their quest for justice.'", "description": "Furious MPs tore into Donald Trump today after the US President appeared to defend\u00a0Anne Sacoolas, who fled the UK after the death of Harry Dunn, 19, in August, saying: 'It happens.'", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19534176-0-image-a-2_1570704002389.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
