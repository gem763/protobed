Levine/Newscom, FILE\n\nActing U.S. Secretary of Labor Patrick Pizzella said in a statement that the rule \"brings a commonsense approach that offers consistency and certainty for employers as well as clarity and prosperity for American workers.\"\n\nThe rules could benefit laborers currently paid slightly over the $23,660 threshold, which exempts them from overtime pay.\n\nCritics were quick to point out, however, that the Trump administration's overtime rules do not go nearly as far as a 2016 rule put forward by the Obama administration that was later shot down in a district court after businesses and states fought against it.\n\nAbout \"8 million fewer workers will get the new or strengthened overtime protections under this Trump rule than they otherwise would have\" compared with the 2016 rule, Shierholz said. \"Overtime protections are a really core component of labor protections that support a middle class. This is a win for people who have benefited from the rigged economy.\"\n\nKelly Ross, deputy policy director at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said a major issue with this new overtime rule, and in general, is that so much time has elapsed between updates.\n\n\"They're not really keeping up with the overtime protections that have been lost to inflation, if nothing else, or to the change in wage levels,\" he said.\n\nThe previous update to overtime protections, in 2004, were the first since 1975, Ross said.\n\n\"One really important thing that's missing from this rule is an automatic adjustment -- we've seen twice that a long period has gone by between the adjustment,\" he added. \"It's a similar situation to minimum wage: You increase the minimum wage once, and a long period of time goes by, and the value of the minimum wage gets eroded over time. The same thing happens with overtime protection.\"\n\nNam Y. Huh/AP, FILE\n\nRoss also argued that the salary threshold \"should be much higher,\" tied to wages and adjusted for inflation.\n\n\"Too many people are being denied overtime,\" said Ross, explaining how some employers label employees as managers to disqualify them from receiving overtime.\n\n\"You've got to make sure that these people are bona fide executives or management,\" he said. \"You can't have people who are spending most of their time doing non-management work having a management title and being called management.\n\n\"These rules have no protections against that kind of abuse.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/fast-food-worker-ap-jt-190925_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
