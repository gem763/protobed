The Dorian models now transfixing millions of Americans are generated by many of the same research organizations, such as the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that model climate change and the devastating track of warming.\n\nThose climate models are in far closer agreement than the spaghetti strands that loop on weather maps a week out from a hurricane\u2019s arrival. Here are just a few things they project in the latest worldwide analysis of hurricane and climate data published in the journal of the American Meteorological Society: Human-caused warming will likely worsen storm inundation because of sea-level rise. Human-caused warming will likely heighten the overall intensity of tropical storms around the world. Human-caused warming will likely increase the rainfall unleashed in such storms\u2014on the order of 10 to 15 percent. Human-caused warming will likely increase the proportion of hurricanes that reach the most destructive levels, Category 4 and 5.\n\nPublic manipulation by the fossil-fuel industry has crippled action on those and other life-threatening projections. But we know we\u2019d be fools to ignore the computer models urging us to prepare for the major hurricane on its way. I find hope in the extraordinary mobilization out front of Dorian, in the human charge that Percy felt from his home north of Louisiana\u2019s Lake Pontchartrain. Our instinct to do what\u2019s best for the human tribe, or at least for ourselves, will finally overcome the small cabal of special interests keeping us to the dangerous path of the status quo.\n\nDavid A. Graham: When Hurricane Dorian hits, look to your neighbors\n\nDesmond Meade, who spearheaded last year\u2019s ballot initiative to restore voting rights to more than 1.4 million Floridians with past felony convictions, talked about hurricanes as he accepted the award for Florida Citizen of the Year from the University of Florida\u2019s Bob Graham Center for Public Service in May. Amendment 4 was another extraordinary mobilization, crossing political and class boundaries. The effort reminded Meade of the communal energy sparked by storms. Counterintuitive though it may sound, he said that over a lifetime in Florida, some of the \u201cbrightest times\u201d he remembered happened surrounding hurricanes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when people just come together to engage with their neighbors,\u201d Meade said.\n\nThen he told the story of the heavyweight fighter Derrick Lewis of Houston, who drove around in his pickup truck following Hurricane Harvey, rescuing more than 100 stranded souls. One of them had nothing but the clothes on his back and a Confederate flag.\n\n\u201cThat African American gentleman was able to look beyond that and just see another human being,\u201d Meade said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an emergency situation, the first question is not going to be: \u2018Did you vote for Donald Trump?\u2019 It\u2019s going to be: \u2018Are you okay? How can I help?\u2019\u201d", "description": "Hurricanes galvanize us to action.
