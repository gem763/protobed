Pasi Aalto An island of tiny homes sits on the coast of Northern Norway. Pasi Aalto\n\nThe island of tiny structures is intended as a retreat for artists and musicians, though the homes have attracted members of the general public as well.\n\nThere are four bedroom cabins, while the rest of the buildings house a bathhouse, kitchen, living room, seaside sauna, and mini cathedral for meditation.\n\nYou can rent the entire island for just R50,000 per week.\n\nThe concept recently won one of Architizer's 2018 A+Awards, which celebrates the world's best design projects.\n\nCindy Ord/Getty Images for Dunkin' Donuts Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Dunkin' Donuts\n\nDunkin' Donuts isn't the first company to dabble in tiny home construction, but it's the first to build a tiny home that runs almost entirely on coffee.\n\nWith help from the manufacturing company Blue Marble Biomaterials, Dunkin' converted 30,000 kilogrammes of spent coffee grounds into enough fuel to power the entire structure.\n\nThough the home is only 275 square feet, it has enough room for a full kitchen, bathroom, and king-sized bed. It even has a \"coffee nook\" for sipping your morning cup.\n\nYves B\u00e9har's prefabricated units could be a solution to the housing affordability crisis in Los Angeles and San Francisco. fuseproject Yves B\u00e9har's prefabricated units could be a solution to the housing affordability crisis in Los Angeles and San Francisco. fuseproject\n\nAs a designer at the forefront of innovation, it seemed natural for Yves B\u00e9har to make the foray into tiny home construction. The new line of prefabricated units from the Swiss industrial designer and entrepreneur are customisable and range in size from 25 to 110 square metres.\n\nB\u00e9har has touted the concept as a possible solution to the housing affordability crisis in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where a lack of housing stock has contributed to rising homelessness.\n\nThough B\u00e9har's current units cost around $280,000 \u2013 just under R4 million \u2013 he plans to design a more affordable line.\n\nBMW designed a line of small luxury cabins. MINI LIVING BMW designed a line of small luxury cabins. MINI LIVING\n\nThese luxury cabins are a product of BMW's MINI Living design series, which debuted similar concepts in London, New York City, and Los Angeles. The company's latest prototype was unveiled in Beijing in collaboration with architect Dayong Sun.\n\nSun's cabin concept includes a mirrored ceiling, convertible walls, and an indoor swing. It draws from classic elements of Chinese architecture, including the traditional Chinese courtyard, or hutong, which creates a mixture of private and communal areas.\n\nThough hutongs are slowly dying out, Sun's design offers a vision of how they could be incorporated into the 21st century.\n\nThe US' first permitted 3D printed home debuted in Texas. New Story/BANDD Designs The US' first permitted 3D printed home debuted in Texas. New Story/BANDD Designs\n\nThis house's sleek and sturdy exterior was made possible by a 3D printer called The Vulcan, which can produce a home onsite without having to piece together individual parts.\n\nEarlier this year, the housing nonprofit New Story teamed up with ICON, a construction-technology company that designs 3D printers, to create the home in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe 30-square-metre structure was built in just 48 hours for $10,000, or around R140,000. Since the printer was only running at 25% speed, the companies believe they can create a larger home - around 55- to 75-square-metres - in just 24 hours for $4,000 or less \u2013 well under R60,000.\n\nThe design company Land Ark created a \"Mad Men\"-inspired RV. Jeremy Gudac The design company Land Ark created a \"Mad Men\"-inspired RV. Jeremy Gudac\n\nThis 30-square-metre converted recreational vehicle from Land Ark was based on a single principle: \"Make it simple, but significant.\" The quote comes from \"Mad Men\"'s Don Draper, who also serves as the namesake for the project.\n\nFor around $144,000, or R2 million, the Draper home comes with a deck, mudroom, and kitchen table that converts into a queen-sized bed.\n\nThe company's co-founder, Brian Buzarde, explained why he was drawn to the concept: \"My favorite thing about living that way is what it does for you mentally,\" he told INSIDER. \"You have to get rid of all the fluff and it leads to great clarity and focus that transcends into every part of your life.\"\n\nA small cabin on a rock overlooks a New Hampshire valley. I-Kanda Architects/Matt Delphenich A small cabin on a rock overlooks a New Hampshire valley. I-Kanda Architects/Matt Delphenich\n\nYou can find this tiny cabin in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the US, atop a granite ledge. Since the design was inspired by the landscape, the home features a 7-metre-wide sliding glass wall that overlooks a valley.\n\nThe structure, which was a finalist for a 2018 Architizer A+Award, was built on hand-poured concrete for stability, and assembled using modular construction.\n\nAt 80 square metres, it's on the larger side for a tiny home. The architects behind the project - a Massachusetts-based firm called I-Kanda - originally planned to create a weekend getaway for two, but decided to expand the project to meet the needs of a four-person family.\n\nKasita stackable homes were designed as units that could be added to existing properties. Kasita Kasita stackable homes were designed as units that could be added to existing properties. Kasita\n\nKasita is also the winner of a 2018 Architizer A+Award, taking home the popular choice prize from the \"living small\" category.\n\nThe structures were designed to be guest houses, granny flats, or backyard rental units that could be added to existing properties. They can also be stacked to maximize space in urban areas.\n\nA 30-square-metre Kasita home takes only weeks to build and costs $139,000, or around R2 million.\n\n\"We want to take the noise out of buying a home,\" the company's founder, Jeff Wilson, told Business Insider in February. \"Imagine how great it would be to be able to buy a home as easily as you buy a product.\n\nSource: Business Insider South Africa\n\nReturn to homepage.", "description": "", "authors": ["Business Insider South Africa"], "top_image": "https://myhome.24.com/8-of-the-most-envy-inducing-tiny-homes-of-the-year-including-a-house-that-can-be-printed-for-less-than-R60000/assets/diVKIoDv8l/c50a5d2518e44e47aaf00fe585e0bc55-1024x683.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
