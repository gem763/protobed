The number of people detained increased roughly 40 per cent since the Trump administration enacted its \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigrant policy. More than 800,000 people have been apprehended at the southwest border in the past year.\n\nDire conditions in the facilities have led to outcries from human rights groups and lawmakers. A report by the DHS Office of Inspector General published this year found that detainees face a variety of serious health and safety risks. The inspectors discovered, for example, that many housing units were damp and covered in mould. They also witnessed \u201cfoul smelling and unrecognisable\u201d food being fed to the prisoners. The risk of illness due to the conditions is high.\n\nAt least seven children are known to have died in U.S. immigration custody since the start of the Trump administration.\n\n[The New York Times]", "description": "The Trump administration is moving to start testing the DNA of people detained by U.S. immigration officers, according to reports of call on Thursday between senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials and reporters....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Sam Rutherford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/r7nvozhvzbjmxbzr6xf1.jpg"}
