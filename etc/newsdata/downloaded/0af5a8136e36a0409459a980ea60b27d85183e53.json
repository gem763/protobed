One was attacked by angry passengers on the platform before a transport worker stepped in. It has now emerged that Extinction Rebellion extremists had acted against the wishes of the vast majority of the group.\n\nIn a poll of more than 2,000 members on an XR discussion forum, 88 per cent said they did not want the Tube protests to go ahead.\n\nSome now fear the \u2018arrogant attitude\u2019 of a small minority acting under a \u2018banner of anarchy\u2019 will lead to further violence. The Mail on Sunday has also learned that:\n\nEven supporters of the Tube protests feared that disrupting \u2018poorer\u2019 commuters and \u2018people of colour\u2019 would confirm the idea that the group is white and middle class;\n\nAmong those who challenged the tactic was an activist whose family was injured in the 7/7 London terror bombings;\n\nSome demonstrators are said to be \u2018willing to sacrifice their lives\u2019 as martyrs for the cause.\n\nThe arguments follow months of internal conflict over the direction XR is taking. One leading figure, Robin Boardman, said the Tube protesters\u2019 action \u2018should be respected\u2019 even if others disagreed.\n\nThe privately educated 21-year-old was at Canning Town station in East London on Thursday when accounts administrator James Mee, 35, and Buddhist teacher Mark Ovland, 36, climbed on to the roof of a train. Both men were dragged off by rush-hour commuters before Mr Mee appeared to be kicked and verbally abused on the platform.\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists James Mee and Mark Ovland at Canning Town station in East London. Among those who challenged the tactic was an activist whose family was injured in the 7/7 London terror bombings\n\nFollowing the action \u2013 carried out by XR South East \u2013 leaders defended the protest but apologised for targeting \u2018poorer parts of London\u2019 where many commuters will be \u2018people of colour\u2019. They added: \u2018Disrupting their journey to work continues the damaging, and untrue, narrative that XR is a white, middle-class group with no understanding of normal people.\u2019\n\nVoicing concern about the planned disruption beforehand, one XR member posted: \u2018An ex-partner was severely injured in the Tube bombings and it led to both my children to require specialist therapy to use the Tube again.\u2019 Another activist said they knew of would-be eco-martyrs among the ranks \u2018willing to sacrifice their lives\u2019, writing online: \u2018I think this is a kind of violence which has no place in XR\u2019s toolkit.\u2019\n\nOthers feared that extremists were being allowed free rein to cause havoc. One said: \u2018I do not wish to risk my freedom and stand with my son under the banner of anarchy, where anyone can do as they please. Dangerous ground.\u2019\n\nCalling for Mr Boardman to resign, another member said: \u2018I am disgusted at the apparent arrogant attitude of the people who went ahead with this protest against the clear wishes of the vast majority.\u2019\n\nA further critic said of the Tube protest: \u2018It may lead to further violence in future as this action portrays XR as arrogant and entitled people who care nothing for people\u2019s working lives.\u2019\n\nPolls show just 13 per cent of the public sympathise with the Tube protest. Policing weeks of XR activity in London is estimated to have cost the taxpayer \u00a316 million \u2013 including about \u00a3500,000 to house 500 officers from forces all over the UK at a four-star Heathrow hotel for nearly two weeks.\n\nXR said: \u2018We are, and will continue to be, totally non-violent.\u2019", "description": "In a poll of more than 2,000 members on an Extinction Rebellion discussion forum, 88 per cent said they did not want the Tube protests to go ahead.", "authors": ["Holly Bancroft For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/20/19935058-0-image-a-14_1571512944972.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
