The site is managed by Arizona State University.\n\nWest\u2019s new film was directed by Nick Knight and is reportedly a companion to an as-yet-unreleased album.\n\nThe Grammy-winner\u2019s fans were alerted last month to a forthcoming album after a tweet by his wife, Kim Kardashian West.\n\nThe new film is an outgrowth of West\u2019s now famous Sunday Services, which the rapper began hosting earlier this year. In September, for instance, West was visibly moved as he welcomed fellow Chicago crooner Chance The Rapper to an outdoor Sunday Service held in their hometown.\n\nKanye West is seen standing on stage in the video with his head in the palm of one hand, as a choir sings the lyrics to his song, \u201cUltralight Beam.\u201d\n\nWest has crisscrossed the country holding his Sunday Service for free for fans. He has appeared in California, Ohio, Georgia, Illinois, and many others.\n\n\u201cKanye started this, I think, just to heal himself,\u201d said the rapper\u2019s wife. \u201cIt was a real personal thing, and it was just friends and family, and he has had an amazing evolution of being born again and being saved by Christ.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "On Friday, rap megastar and fashion mogul Kanye West released a short trailer for his upcoming IMAX film \"Jesus Is King.\"", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/kanyewestjesusis1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
