He has signed off on the discussion, but no action is imminent, Bloomberg said.\n\nUS and Chinese officials are due to meet next month for another round of trade discussions. So far, that dispute - triggered by US complaints of Chinese protectionism - has shown little sign of resolution.\n\nThe two sides have imposed tariffs on thousands of items worth hundreds of billions in annual trade.\n\nThe US is due to impose another round of tariffs next month.", "description": "US stocks fell after reports that the White House is looking at new ways to limit US investment in China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9A10/production/_109004493_tv023965853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
