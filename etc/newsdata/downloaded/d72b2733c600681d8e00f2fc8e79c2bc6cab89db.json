Perhaps, but the issue might be as complex as the man himself, John Wayne. Writing in the Orange County Register over the weekend, columnist David Whiting argued that the local airport needs a new name in light of Wayne\u2019s expressions of support for white supremacy. Should a major airport carry Wayne\u2019s name in light of his views?\n\n[W]hen it comes to plastering someone\u2019s name on an international airport that sees nearly 1 million passengers a month, there must be careful, considered and continued thought. What was OK in 1978 when supervisors named JWA is not necessarily OK in today\u2019s world \u2014 and perhaps it never should have been acceptable. When I drive by or fly out of John Wayne Airport, a place most of us simply refer to as \u201cJohn Wayne,\u201d I don\u2019t always think about the actor and his dark statements. But when I do, I am troubled. For many people it\u2019s worse. Being forced to buy and carry around an airline ticket that unavoidably honors someone\u2019s racism is an insult.\n\nWell, how bad was it? Um \u2026 pretty bad, actually, and not really all that secret. Whiting quotes a 1971 Playboy interview, which were usually published as verbatim transcripts, in which Wayne explored his views on race relations. The Washington Post first reported on this in February of this year from excerpts published by a Hollywood screenwriter. Unfortunately, this quote is accurate and in context with the rest of the interview:\n\nIn the 1971 interview, Wayne railed against \u201cperverted films,\u201d giving the interviewer, Richard Warren Lewis, two examples when asked: \u201cEasy Rider\u201d and \u201cMidnight Cowboy.\u201d The actor described the characters in the latter film with a homophobic slur, then went on to extol the virtues of sexual intercourse between men and women. \u201cI believe in white supremacy,\u201d he said, and spoke harshly about African Americans, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people,\u201d he said.\n\nNeedless to say, anyone expressing these thoughts today would get cancelled very quickly, even perhaps without a cancel-culture mentality, and rightly so. There\u2019s more too, which makes it clear that this was no rhetorical misstep or misunderstanding. The remarks also surfaced briefly in 2016 when Wayne\u2019s daughter Aissa endorsed Donald Trump, although there doesn\u2019t appear to have been any push to strip his name from the airport at that time.\n\nBut this didn\u2019t take place today; it took place nearly 50 years ago involving a man from a very different era. As his family points out, Wayne lived his life without actively harming others even if he did hold views that were outdated even at that time. Whiting also notes that Wayne\u2019s wives all spoke Spanish, which means that his bark was probably much worse than his bite. Wayne may have participated in politics, but he\u2019s remembered for his contributions to the film industry and the region.\n\nWayne wasn\u2019t a saint, but that\u2019s not usually the bar for having facilities named after someone. There probably isn\u2019t much call for Robert Byrd\u2019s name to be stripped off of dozens if not hundreds of public facilities in West Virginia despite his membership in the Klan. Nor should there be, since the decision to put his name on those buildings had little to do with that phase of his life, but rather his public service (and his access to pork, but that\u2019s another issue altogether). If we removed all the names off all the facilities of people who fell short of perfection or our evolving ideals, no one\u2019s name would last long \u2014 not even newspaper columnists\u2019.\n\nAt the National Review, Kyle Smith concurs, and suggests that the idea infantilizes everyone else:\n\nOn the other hand, our nation\u2019s capital is named after a guy who owned slaves, which is worse than saying any of these things in 1971. Many if not most of our heroes had feet of clay. Once we start down the road of renaming things, ripping down statues, destroying stained-glass windows, and the like, we\u2019re going to find it hard to declare when enough is enough. I think we\u2019re mature enough to walk through John Wayne Airport without mistaking it for a monument to white supremacy.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that the decision to name the airport after Wayne in 1979 was controversial, but for an entirely different reason. Wayne had nothing to do with the airport or with aviation, and people in the area wanted the airport named for the man who created it in the first place, aviation pioneer Eddie Martin. They left Martin\u2019s name on the terminal in use at the time, but that later got demolished for the Thomas F. Riley terminal in use now, named after a county supervisor. The county wanted to honor Wayne, a longtime resident, but many suspected they also wanted to have a readily marketable name for the airport, too.\n\nThat makes this controversy a bit ironic, but still, circling back around to this forty years later says more about Whiting and cancel culture than it does about Wayne or the airport. Wayne had his faults, as we all do and did, but the recognition he receives at the airport is for a lifetime of legitimately iconic work in the entertainment industry, not to suggest that he was a saint. Leave the airport alone, leave the Wayne family alone, and work on improving the present in Orange County.
