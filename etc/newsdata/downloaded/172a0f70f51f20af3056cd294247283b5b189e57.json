Photo: HBO\n\nThe primary thing that stands out about Jeremy Strong\u2019s performance on Succession this season is the incredible, overwhelming, soul-crushing sense of a kind of despair that stems from fatherly emotional abuse, guilt over manslaughter, and the vicissitudes of capitalism. But secondarily, there\u2019s the fact that Kendall\u2019s still a real dork. Nowhere is that clearer than in this week\u2019s episode, \u201cDundee,\u201d when he gets up at his father\u2019s big fat Scottish birthday and performs a rap number about Logan while wearing a Logan Roy baseball jersey, underneath a similarly in-character brown suit and bow tie. Like a lot of Kendall\u2019s taste, the whole look skews very \u201crich white bro who doesn\u2019t understand how to express his own taste but wants to make a big statement.\u201d\n\nStrong at the Emmys. Photo: Dan MacMedan/WireImage\n\nBut watching that episode, the suit also stood out for another reason: It bears a striking resemblance to the brown tuxedo Jeremy Strong himself wore to the Emmys last Sunday. The texture is the same, the lapels are cut in the same way, event the bow tie looks identical. The primary difference: At the Emmys, Strong wore a vest underneath his suit, but on Succession, Kendall didn\u2019t \u2014 presumably because he was hiding that jersey underneath his jacket instead.\n\nUnless Jeremy Strong is utterly oblivious to the choices some stylist is making, there\u2019s something more than coincidence at play here. Did he steal the suit from the Succession set and decide to wear it again at a fancy event? We can\u2019t blame him, those clothes all look so nice, and at the risk of narcing on him for a wardrobe crime, we reached out to HBO to confirm whether that\u2019s actually the case. (No answer to this important query as of yet.) Or did he simply want to pay homage to his own character? Was Jeremy Strong in character as Kendall at the Emmys? Does that explain his stone-faced poses? Maybe this is all multidimensional chess being played out to some mysterious end, which depends on us becoming obsessed with this one wardrobe choice at the expense of being able to think about any other television series. In any case, consider us Rhea Jarrell in this moment, because the Roy children are playing us.", "description": "Did Jeremy Strong wear the same brown suit with a bow tie he wore as Kendall Roy on Succession to the Emmys?", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-succession-tux.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
