Its sales outlook for the holiday shopping season also disappointed analysts, and its stock sank 7 per cent in after-hours trading.\n\nAmazon is moving to cut its delivery time in half to one day instead of two. To do that, it's adding more workers in its warehouses and expanding its shipping network with more trucks, jets and package sorting facilities.\n\nThe effort is costing the company about US$1.5 billion ($2.2 billion), nearly double what it previously said it would cost. But Amazon said the one-day shipping is attracting more customers and gets shoppers to spend more.\n\n\"It's a big investment,\" said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in a statement. \"And it's the right long-term decision for customers.\"\n\nThe Seattle-based company reported net income of US$2.1 billion in the three months ending Sept. 30, down from US$2.9 billion a year ago.\n\nEarnings per share came to US$4.23. That's US36\u00a2 less than what analysts expected, according to FactSet.", "description": "The world's biggest online retailer faces fierce competition from Walmart and other e-commerce players.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8582%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_80/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8060bb9e6dbfaeb9dae40e74b00a68a34eaebfe5", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
