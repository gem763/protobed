Redskins downplay significance of adding former Eagles", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "ASHBURN \u2014 Wendell Smallwood wasn\u2019t surprised when the Philadelphia Eagles released him last weekend. The running back watched this offseason as the Eagles added both Jordan Howard and Miles Sanders at his position. It was clear, he said, Philadelphia was moving in a different direction.\n\nBeing snatched up by the Washington Redskins, however, did catch Smallwood off guard.\n\nNot only would he be staying in the division, he\u2019d have a shot at his former team right away when Washington opens the season Sunday in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cThey kind of couldn\u2019t get rid of me in a sense,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to go whoop up on my old teammates.\u201d\n\nSmallwood wasn\u2019t the only former Eagle claimed by the Redskins, either. Washington signed defensive tackle Treyvon Hester on Monday \u2014 raising the question of whether the Redskins did so specifically to get some inside information ahead of their matchup. Both players would have insights into the Eagles\u2019 on both sides of the ball, so why not use it?\n\nCoach Jay Gruden downplayed that angle.\n\n\u201cCould be a little bit of a benefit, but at the end of the day we don\u2019t know what play they\u2019re going to call,\u201d Gruden said. Both pickups were brought in because of their skillsets, the coach said, not their knowledge of the Philadelphia Eagles offense or defense.\n\nSmallwood is expected to contribute on special teams, possibly as a kick returner. At 5-foot-10, the 26-year-old was a first- and second-down back in Philadelphia, but he won\u2019t have that role with Washington as Adrian Peterson and Derrius Guice are the team\u2019s main backs. Gruden said Monday the offense will run through Guice.\n\nSo far, Smallwood said his new coaches and teammates haven\u2019t asked for him to relay any tips on facing the Eagles. That\u2019s not something Smallwood appears entirely comfortable with sharing, as well. Smallwood said he\u2019s \u201cnot into\u201d giving the Redskins plays, mentioning the Eagles still mean a lot to him since they won a Super Bowl together.\n\nHester, on the other hand, thinks he can give a \u201clittle bit\u201d of insight into the Eagles, but said, \u201cI can\u2019t give too much.\u201d Hester said he could help the Redskins\u2019 offensive linemen understand where the Eagles\u2019 defensive line tends to attack from. He also knows the style of each defensive linemen.\n\nThe 26-year-old needs to help in any way he can. The Redskins are already Hester\u2019s third team since he was drafted in 2017 in the seventh round. He was brought in to add to the team\u2019s defensive line depth with Tim Settle and Caleb Brantley nursing injuries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another chance,\u201d Hester said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a dream I\u2019ve been trying to live out my whole life. So I\u2019ve got to continue to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nHistorically, teams have always been willing to add players from rival teams as a way to gain an edge. In 2017, the Eagles added former Redskins quarterback Nate Sudfeld ahead of that year\u2019s season-opener in the District. When Redskins coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell was with the New York Jets as a player, coaches turned to him to get perspective on New England\u2019s defense as the quarterback was drafted by the Patriots.\n\nStill, it will ultimately be up to the coaching staff to formulate a gameplan. Sometimes, any potential insights from players could just as well be gleaned by watching hours of game tape.\n\n\u201cThe film tells the story,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cYou see what guys run and you make the gameplan. \u2026 It\u2019s our job as professionals to be ready for whatever they throw at us.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
