Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that it is Angel Families \u201cwho should be mattering\u201d to elected officials, not illegal aliens.\n\nDuring a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this week, Mendoza \u2014 who heads the Angel Families organization \u2014 told Feinstein that while illegal aliens have been allowed to sue the federal government for being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border, Angel Families are left without recourse when their loved ones are killed by illegal aliens:\n\nUnfortunately, Angel Families, we witness illegal aliens suing our federal government for being separated at the border for 20 or 30 days from their child and Angel Families have no recourse to sue anybody for the death of their loved ones, and yet all of these policies are made without our approval. [Emphasis added] There is no voter approval on any policies that are put into place. And so we\u2019ve got to have some sort of avenue as Angel Families, and if it\u2019s going to be hitting somebody where it hurts to make them realize, you are protecting the wrong people in your country. We are the people who should be mattering. [Emphasis added]\n\nMendoza\u2019s son, 32-year-old police officer Brandon Mendoza, was killed in May 2014 by a drunk illegal alien who was driving the wrong way down a highway in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nMendoza said the overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers oppose sanctuary policies despite often having to enforce them. Take, for example, the recent case where Fairfax County, Virginia, Police Chief Edwin Roessler Jr. temporarily suspended an officer who helped federal immigration officials capture an illegal alien fugitive.\n\n\u201cI know from my son\u2019s position being a police officer that \u2026 a lot of police departments are directed by the mayor and the city council as to what their policies will be regarding sanctuary policies,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cAnd this is where I have an issue with because these city officials are taking it upon themselves to make this decision, instruct our law enforcement officers, their hands are tied behind their backs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say more than 85 percent of the time, law enforcement does not agree with sanctuary policies,\u201d Mendoza continued. \u201cThey know that it makes their life more dangerous. I know it from doing ride alongs with my son. If there was an illegal criminal that was out there that he was going to have to go arrest \u2026 it\u2019s a scary situation. It\u2019s not anything any of us want to deal with and to voluntarily be making our law enforcement jobs more dangerous and putting their lives at a higher risk I think is just wrong.\u201d\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) has introduced legislation, supported by Angel Families, that would allow Americans whose loved ones have been killed or murdered by illegal aliens to sue sanctuary jurisdictions for their role in protecting these suspects.\n\nTo date, there are nine sanctuary states across the U.S., as well as nearly 200 counties, cities, and towns that have implemented sanctuary policies to shield criminal illegal aliens from deportation.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
