This is in Greek English.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very well educated. I\u2019m going to university, I got an unconditional offer so there is no way I would write a paragraph like this.\u2019\n\nThe teenager added: \u2018It doesn\u2019t make grammatical sense.\n\n\u2018All the way through there isn\u2019t one sentence an English person would write.\u2019\n\nA friend, who she met at the airport and shared a room with, also claimed police added details to her own statement, which she deleted when the officer left the room.\n\nThe psychology graduate said: \u2018He wrote something in the statement that I didn\u2019t actually say.\n\n\u2018It was in reference to how much we had been drinking.\u2019\n\nThe defendant told the court she arrived in Cyprus, then aged 18, a week before the alleged rape in an \u2018attempt to grow up\u2019 before going to university.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m academically educated, (but) I\u2019m 18 years old I have no life experience. I don\u2019t know how life works,\u2019 she recounted.\n\nSome of the Israeli tourists leave court following an earlier hearing (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe Israelis arrested in connection with the allegations all returned home after they were released (Picture: EPA)\n\nShe wept as she admitted lying to her mother in a text sent from the police station which said: \u2018Trust me, I\u2019m OK.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think any child will lie to their parents to tell them they are OK because parents don\u2019t stop worrying about their child,\u2019 she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If your child had just been raped by 12 Israelis and wouldn\u2019t get out of bed and had a throat so swollen she couldn\u2019t breathe and was taken to the police station for what she thought was an hour but then went on to be nearly eight hours.\u2019\n\nThe teenager said she \u2018felt vulnerable\u2019 while she was at the police station because the detective \u2018wasn\u2019t going by the law\u2019 and she \u2018wasn\u2019t allowed a lawyer\u2019.\n\n\u2018I immediately assumed corruption and conspiracy so I wouldn\u2019t put it past him, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if at that moment he would have kidnapped me and killed me,\u2019 she said.\n\nThe woman spent four-and-a-half weeks in prison before she was granted bail at the end of August, but cannot leave the island.\n\nShe could face up to a year in jail and a 1,700 euro (roughly \u00a31,500) fine if she is convicted.\n\nThe 12 young Israeli men arrested in connection with the allegations all returned home after they were released.\n\nThe trial continues on Thursday.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
