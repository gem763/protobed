Chelsea may be learning on the job, but they are improving quickly and the naivety that resulted in a home defeat to Valencia in Lampard\u2019s first Champions League game in charge has since been overridden by a desire and a growing knowledge of how to win.\n\nIt is not just the players who are growing, either. The fact this success came courtesy of two substitutes, Christian Pulisic and goalscorer Michy Batshuayi, offered proof that Lampard is managing his squad, rather than just his team.\n\n\u201cI am delighted,\u201d said a buoyant Lampard. \u201cDelighted with every element of the performance. There were moments, but you come to Ajax against the quality of their team they were going to have moments. But the work ethic of the group, the work we put in off the ball for every man and the subs was outstanding. It has to be to come here and get a result.", "description": "Frank Lampard was told he looked scared of Ajax by a Dutch reporter on Tuesday evening, but 24 hours later the Chelsea head coach watched his young team prove they will fear nobody this season.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213921459-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
