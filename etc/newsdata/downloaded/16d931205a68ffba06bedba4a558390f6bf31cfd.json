The Justice Department did not specify the number of people from each country who were charged.\n\nThe site's operator, a South Korean named Jong Woo-son, and 337 users in 12 different countries, have been charged so far, authorities said.\n\nJong, currently serving an 18-month sentence in South Korea, was also indicted on federal charges in Washington.\n\nSeveral other people charged in the case have already been convicted and are serving prison sentences of up to 15 years, the Justice Department said.\n\nThe investigation has led to the rescue of at least 23 underage victims in the U.S., Britain and Spain who were being actively abused by users of the site. Many children in the videos have not yet been identified.\n\nWelcome to Video is one of the first websites to monetize child pornography using bitcoin, which allows users to hide their identities during financial transactions, the authorities said.\n\nUsers were able to redeem the digital currency in return for points that they could spend downloading videos or buying all-you-can watch VIP accounts. Points could also be earned by uploading new child pornography.\n\nThe Justice Department said the site collected at least $370,000 worth of bitcoin before it was taken down in March 2018 and that the currency was laundered through three unnamed digital currency exchanges.", "description": "Canadians\u00a0are among the 338 people charged as part of a global criminal investigation into a child pornography website that sold videos using bitcoin digital currency,\u00a0U.S. law enforcement officials said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4246988.1502741445!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/computer-porn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
