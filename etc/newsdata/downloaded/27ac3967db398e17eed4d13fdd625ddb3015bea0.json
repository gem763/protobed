On the way he drove down a dirt road and strangled the woman to death with his hands.\n\nLittle placed the woman\u2019s body on a pile of branches and old cornstalks in or near a corn field.\n\nHe believes the woman\u2019s name may have been Ruth and that her mother lived in North Little Rock.\n\nUnnamed 'hippie'\n\nLittle was driving from Ohio to Cincinnati in the summer of 1984 when he met a 25-year-old white woman outside a strip club.\n\nShe was around 5\u20196\u201d - 5\u20197\u201d tall and 130-170 pounds, with short blonde hair, blue eyes and a \u201chippie\u201d appearance.\n\n(Image: FBI)\n\nShe approached him and asked for a ride to Miami, Florida, explaining that her mother lived there.\n\nThey drove into northern Kentucky, down into a hilly area and then along a small dirt road to the top of a \u201clittle round hill\".\n\nHe strangled the woman in the backseat of his car and left her body on the top of the hill.\n\nUnnamed woman in Las Vegas\n\nIn 1993 Little was driving a 1978 yellow Cadillac Eldorado to Los Angeles when he met a black woman on Owens Avenue or Jackson Street in Las Vegas.\n\nThe thin, dark-skinned woman was around 40-years-old, 5'5\u201d tall and 110-120 pounds.\n\nLittle believed the woman had naturally short hair but wore a long-haired wig.\n\n(Image: FBI)\n\nThe killer took her to a motel room, where he strangled her to death before putting her body in the trunk of his car and driving to the outskirts of Las Vegas.\n\nHe pulled off on a remote road and rolled the woman\u2019s body down a steep slope.\n\nLittle then threw her clothes further down the road.\n\nIt is highly likely that her body was never found.\n\nUnnamed woman from New Orleans\n\nBack in 1982, possibly during the autumn, Little met a black woman in New Orleans.\n\nShe was between 30 and 40-years-old, 5\u20198\u201d-5\u20199\u201d tall and weighed 160 pounds, with \u201choney-colored\u201d brown skin and medium-length straight hair.\n\nLittle met her in a club where she was celebrating a birthday with a group of friends and one of her two sisters.\n\nHe left with the woman in his car, a Lincoln Continental Mark III.\n\n(Image: FBI)\n\nThe woman told the murderer that she lived with her mother, who was ill and relied on her help.\n\nShe gave Little the keys to her house. He then drove the woman to the Little Woods exit off I-10, where he turned down a dirt road along a canal that was being dredged.\n\nThey left the car and Little pulled the woman towards the canal, killing her and dumping her body.\n\nAfterward, Little drove back to the motel where he was staying in Pascagoula, Mississippi.\n\n(Image: FBI)\n\nTo view drawings of Little's remaining victims along with brief descriptions, click here.\n\nLittle confessed to his crimes in a bid to secure a prison transfer.\n\nThe FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program crime analyst Christie Palazzolo said: \"For many years, Samuel Little believed he would not be caught because he thought no one was accounting for his victims.\n\n\"Even though he is already in prison, the FBI believes it is important to seek justice for each victim to close every case possible.\"\n\nSince the confession he has been extradited to Texas over a murder in the state and is expected to die in jail.\n\nTexas Ranger James Holland has spent more than 700 hours coaxing Little into confessing to more than 90 murders in 19 states.\n\nHe first interview took place in May last year, when Ranger Holland visited Little in California State Prison.", "description": "Samuel Little drew portraits of his victims after confessing to 93 murders to the FBI - and so far 50 have been verified", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Fbi", "Wise County Jail"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558704.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_WEEKEND-CONTENT-Chilling-sketchbook-of-US-most-profilic-killer-detailing-faces-of-all-93-victims.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
