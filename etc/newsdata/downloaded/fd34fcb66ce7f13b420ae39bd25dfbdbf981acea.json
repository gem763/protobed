Photo: Courtesy of Cruz Valdez\n\nThis powder-coated steel seat by the Brooklyn-based artist Serban Ionescu is one of around 50 chairs that will be on display at R & Company (64 White St.) beginning September 10. The exhibit, dubbed \u201cChairs Beyond Right & Wrong,\u201d was curated by collector Raquel Cayre, and is the latest among a handful to focus on surrealist seats. In April, the Future Perfect displayed a selection at its new New York showroom, the design fair Object & Thing popped up in East Williamsburg with a dedicated chair section, and even the kids at RISD had their own weird-chair show this spring. As Eames and Risom fatigue have started to settle in among design-minded folks, a chair made entirely of striped pillows is a not-too-drastic way to infuse some wacky design into an otherwise not-so-daring apartment. Though many of the chairs in the show \u2014 like the Ionescu, whose back droops forward \u2014 aren\u2019t exactly meant for reclining in and watching an episode of Succession. \u201cI\u2019ve always treated chairs, even functional chairs, like sculptures in my own apartment,\u201d says Cayre. \u201cIt\u2019s my opinion that a chair shouldn\u2019t be reduced to just function.\u201d\n\nThree More Oddball Loungers From Chairs Beyond Right & Wrong\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Cruz Valdez\n\nSeat Belt\n\nJim Lambie, a Glasgow-based contemporary artist who has shown his mixed-media sculptures everywhere from the Museum of Modern Art to the New Museum to Tate Britain, handcrafted the belts that form this chair out of steel and acrylic paint.\n\nFrom left: Photo: Courtesy of Cruz Valdez Photo: Courtesy of R & Company From left: Photo: Courtesy of Cruz Valdez Photo: Courtesy of R & Company\n\nHermaphroditee\n\nThis hanging chair, which visitors can sit inside with their legs hanging out, was fashioned out of gypsum by Rogan Gregory, a clothing designer turned sculptor who focuses on biomorphic and geologic forms.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Cruz Valdez\n\nUntitled\n\nArtist Katherine Bernhardt\u2019s paintings prominently feature electric shades of pink and recurring 2-D-style imagery of parrots and bananas, so this vaguely tropical resin-and-fiberglass seat/objet feels right at home in her body of work.\n\nAnd 11 Other Off-Kilter Options\n\nLikeMindedObjects Bleached Denim Chair LikeMindedObjects, known for its squiggly floor lamps, produced this discarded-blue-jean chair for Urban Outfitters. $1,300 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nWest Elm Ruby Slipper Chair \u200bWhile the dimensions and palette read slightly SpongeBob, this West Elm number feels blobby yet refined. $180 at West Elm Buy\n\nAsh NYC Pillow Chair Created by ASH NYC, the pillow chair is inspired by the Italian Riviera of the 1960s and made from Schumacher textiles. $1,500 at Pillow Chair Buy\n\nTord Boontje M\u2019Afrique Shadowy Armchair This indoor-outdoor chair, whose tall back offers shade, was designed by Tord Boontje and fabricated from steel and woven wire at workshops in Dakar, Senegal. $1,700 at MoMA Design Store Buy\n\nKatie Stout Stuffed Chair Katie Stout has been creating \u201cstuffed chairs\u201d like this one (with fabric, found materials, embroidery, and beading) for the past several years. $2,500 at 1stdibs Buy\n\nWonderful Industry Ltd Inflatable Empire Chair This Wonderful Industry plastic seat filled with holographic glitter folds into an 11-by-9-inch square when deflated. $26 at Amazon Buy $26 at Amazon Buy\n\nCasey Zablocki A9909 Chair Montana-based artist Casey Zablocki fired this thronelike seat in a wood anagama kiln, a technique he learned in Korea. $18,500 at Roman and Williams Guild Buy\n\nCB2 Cerchio Chair \u200bItalian-ish in design\u200b\u200b, this CB2 dining chair has sustainably sourced oak atop its metal frame.
