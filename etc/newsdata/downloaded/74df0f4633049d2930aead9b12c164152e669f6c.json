Backed by some in the media, they flocked to Twitter to promote abortion.\n\nFor its \u201c#SafeAbortionDay\u201d tweet, NARAL argued that, \u201cThere's absolutely nothing \u2018pro-life\u2019 about cutting off access to safe abortion care.\u201d That\u2019s because, it claimed, states with abortion restrictions also have higher rates of infant and maternal deaths.\n\nNARAL\u2019s right: Infant and maternal deaths should be prevented. But that doesn\u2019t mean abortion is the answer. Abortion is never the answer.\n\nThe UN Special Procedures, or UN human rights experts based in Geneva, Switzerland, tweeted, \u201cThe devastating consequences on [women]'s lives & health caused by unsafe abortions leave no space for retrogression.\u201d In other words, \u201cAll states must ensure access to safe & legal abortion as a matter of #HumanRights.\u201d\n\n\u201c#HealthForAll,\u201d the experts declared. Except for the unborn, that is.\n\nFor its part, Amnesty International chanted, \u201cMy body, my health. My body, my choice. My body, my rights. My body, my voice.\u201d\n\nLike the others, it overlooked that with every pregnancy, there are two bodies \u2013 not one.\n\nThe organization also revealed that it had partnered with Women\u2019s March Global for the day. Together, the two groups released messages including, \u201cCriminalising abortion does not stop abortions. It makes them less safe\u201d [sic] and \u201cAbortion is a basic healthcare need for millions of people.\u201d\n\nBut health care\u2019s aim is never to end lives; It is to save them.\n\nStill, Emily\u2019s List in Australia shared that the day marked \u201ca global day of action for universally accessible safe and legal abortion\u201d because \u201cAbortion is healthcare and healthcare is a human right.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Massachusetts echoed, \u201c#Sept28 is a Global Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion. Abortion is health care, and health care is a human right. All people deserve access to safe, legal abortion.\u201d\n\nOnce associated with Planned Parenthood, the Guttmacher Institute warned, \u201cGlobally, abortion stigma still discourages many people from seeking safe abortion & postabortion care.\u201d That\u2019s why, it added, \u201cReducing stigma through education & awareness campaigns is an urgent global health issue.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, it continued, \u201cIncreasing access to safe and legal abortion is key to eliminating unsafe abortion and its impact on the health and well-being of women worldwide.\u201d\n\nAlso chiming in, the Center for Reproductive Rights continued, \u201cNo one should be denied safe abortion care just because of where they live. But today, 90 million women of reproductive age still live in countries that ban abortion.\u201d\n\nVoices published by the media also showed support.\n\nJust in time for International Safe Abortion Day, TIME published a story with the headline \u201cAbortion Bans Strip People of Their Human Rights. Here's Why We Must Stand In Solidarity Against Them.\u201d For the piece, Uma Mishra-Newbery, the Women\u2019s March Global executive director, and Jaime Todd-Gher an Amnesty International legal advisor, wrote that, \u201cAny person who does not control what happens to their body cannot be free.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cwe all have a role to play in reclaiming our rights,\u201d they wrote, governments must also \u201cexpand access to safe, lawful and affordable abortion and contraception for all people.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only is it the humane thing to do, it is a state obligation under international law,\u201d they concluded. \u201cIt will prevent countless deaths, life-long trauma and life-changing injuries.\u201d\n\nSomething else prevents those too: a culture of life. Again, the writers, along with the many organizations celebrating \u201cInternational Safe Abortion Day,\u201d forgot to address the pro-life movement\u2019s concern: that abortion always ends a life. Furthermore, it wounds women, many of whom choose abortion because they feel like they had no other choice.\n\nAbortion doesn\u2019t have to be the only option. That\u2019s why pregnancy centers, which provide pregnant women and new moms with free support including free housing, medical supplies, clothing, and educational classes, are so important.\n\nWomen deserve better than abortion, which is never safe.", "description": "Organizations around the world are celebrating \u201cInternational Safe Abortion Day.\u201d .09/28/2019 17:25:43PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/165/26e4108e-5ef1-47c8-8adc-58d56c010cfc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
