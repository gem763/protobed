Digital Age [Margrethe Vestager] to address the distortive effects of foreign subsidies in the internal market.\"\n\nThe EU has been looking at ways to tackle China's massive subsidies, but trade chief Sabine Weyand last week ruled out applying EU state aid law \"extraterritorially.\"\n\nThe president-elect also confirmed there would be a new \"chief trade enforcer\" post, appointed by the College of Commissioners, who will work under Hogan's \"direct guidance to monitor and improve the compliance of our trade agreements.\"\n\nLastly, von der Leyen said Hogan should \"contribute to the design and introduction of the carbon border tax, working closely with the commissioner for the economy. The carbon border tax should be fully compliant with WTO rules.\"", "description": "\u2018I want you to look at how we can strengthen our trade toolbox,\u2019 Commission chief tells her trade commissioner pick, Phil Hogan.", "authors": ["Jakob Hanke", "David M.
