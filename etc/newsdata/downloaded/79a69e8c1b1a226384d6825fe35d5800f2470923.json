The band which currently includes Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo continues to produce new music and has done so over several decades with tours to support those new albums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe band is in the middle of an epic tour unlike anything ever before.Their WorldWired tour, in support of their latest album \u2018Hardwired\u2026 to Self-Destruct,\u2019 began in 2016 and will run through 2020 bringing the band to nearly every continent.\n\nSince their inception, Metallica has sold nearly 22.1 million total tickets worth about $1.4 billion dollars according to Pollstar Box office... more than AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne or any other rock band. Guns N\u2019 Roses is the next closest competitor with a modest $800 million in ticket sales.\n\nMetallica may be right behind another famous rock band, U2, who with their 360 tour in 2011, became the highest-grossing concert tour in history pulling in $736 million. But the metal bands profits continue to grow putting them alongside Rolling Stones and new kid on the block, Taylor Swift.\n\nBut what sets Metallica apart, is their outrageous merchandise sales records of over $125 million in North America alone and their ability to sell out shows in nearly every continent, including Antarctica.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI keep thinking and forcing myself to think all our best years are still ahead of us. We may even turn professional and do this full time one day,\u201d Metallica\u2019s Lars Ulrich told Pollstar. \u201cThat\u2019s the MO. It\u2019s always, \u2018What\u2019s your favorite record?\u2019 It\u2019s the next one, the one we haven\u2019t recorded yet. It\u2019s always about the possibilities, always about what can be, what\u2019s coming. That, to me, is what this is all about and I think that attitude is a big part of the why Metallica still connects to so many people around the world.\u201d", "description": "Metallica rolls in more cash than any other touring rock band ever.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Metallica-2003-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
