It should be a call to action,\u201d said Lisa M. Horowitz, a pediatric psychologist at the National Institute of Mental Health. \u201cIf you had kids suddenly dying at these rates from a new disease or infection, there would be a huge outcry. But most people don\u2019t even know this is happening. It\u2019s not recognized for the public health crisis it has become.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also showed homicides among ages 10 to 24 increasing 23 percent from 2014 through 2017 after a long period of decline. This trend mirrors a similar uptick in homicides across other age groups, said CDC statistician Sally C. Curtin, who compiled the new report.\n\nFirearms are one factor looming over both worrisome trends. The United States has more guns per capita than any other country. It also has by far a higher rate of gun deaths than any other wealthy country. And while violent homicides often grab headlines, more gun deaths every year are attributed to suicide.\n\nAD\n\nThe sharp increase in teen suicides has especially frustrated and puzzled researchers, who have struggled to explain its causes. Some have attributed it to changing social structures, lack of community and the rise of social media and smartphones. Others have pointed to bullying and less sleep.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe truth is anyone who says they definitively know what is causing it doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Ursula Whiteside, a researcher with the University of Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex problem with no easy answers so far.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMany studies, for example, have explored the ways social media might exacerbate depression and stress in teenagers. But at the same time, other studies have shown social media to be a positive force \u2014 reaching isolated individuals and creating social connections that didn\u2019t exist before.\n\nThe Internet may have made it easier to research lethal ways of killing oneself. But at the same time, it has made resources such as suicide prevention hotlines, text and chat programs more readily available than ever.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you asked 10 years ago, no one would have known where to call when they\u2019re in a crisis,\u201d said Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. \u201cNow we have a number, 1-800-273-8255. There\u2019s even a catchy song about it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSuicide deaths among youths remains a relatively low number compared to much larger numbers of deaths among those who are middle-aged and elderly. Still, the sharper increase among youths is alarming because of the trajectory it suggests.\n\n\u201cIt points to how important early intervention is to the prevention effort,\u201d said Harkavy-Friedman, pointing to numerous studies showing that early intervention \u2014 such as suicide screening at emergency rooms and pediatricians\u2019 offices \u2014 can have a large effect on the number of suicide attempts.\n\nAD\n\nOther interventions researchers have focused on in recent years include safety plans and lethal means counseling, in which counselors help those struggling with mental health and their families plan ahead to remove immediate access to drugs and firearms.\n\nAD", "description": "The disturbing trend worries researchers who have struggled to understand its causes.", "authors": ["William Wan", "National Correspondent Covering Health", "Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-PiDeU8MVHATALzB0rQlgJvxIgs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WTS2GIT6LYI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
