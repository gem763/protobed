Weaver\u2019s decision to step down as leader does not affect the current British Columbia arrangement since he is keeping his seat.\n\nThe NDP hold 41 seats versus the Liberals\u2019 42, while the Greens hold three in British Columbia\u2019s legislature.\n\nWeaver, 57, announced his decision on Twitter, saying the Greens \u201care going strong, as am I.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with this great swell of enthusiasm around climate action... I feel it is the right time for me to pass the baton to this next generation of leaders.\u201d\n\nWeaver said on Twitter last month that he was hospitalized with labyrinthitis, an inflammation in the inner ear that causes symptoms including nausea and vertigo, although he said his choice to step down was unrelated.\n\nBefore entering politics, Weaver was a scientist and lead author on several U.N. reports on climate change.\n\nThe leadership contest will likely take place at the Green Party convention in June 2020, according to a party news release.", "description": "The head of British Columbia's Green Party, which is crucial to keeping the left-leaning New Democratic Party in power in the Canadian province, said on Monday he would step down as leader once a successor is chosen and will not run in the next election due in 2021.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438176283&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961J4-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
