Part ways with McCracken? No way. These people don't understand loyalty.\u201d\n\nAfter reports surfaced that he had been mentally suffering ahead of the fight, Joshua quickly denied the idea on his YouTube channel shortly after the fight.\n\n\u201cI had no panic attack, I'm not that type of person. I have to take my loss like a man, I'm not blaming any man or any thing.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated this to Sky Sports last month when he was asked again about having a panic attack.\n\n\"What is a panic attack?\" he replied. \"No, no [laughs].\u201d", "description": "Rob McCraken will resume his role at the forefront of Anthony Joshua's boxing team and has dismissed the possibility of making substantial changes to his preparation ahead of the rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr on December 7 in Saudi Arabia.
