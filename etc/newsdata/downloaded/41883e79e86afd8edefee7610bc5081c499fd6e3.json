(Image: R.B. Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, and David Curiel, Marvel Comics)\n\nLast week, House of X came to an end with its eyes toward the stars, a glimmer of hope in the face of a new age. This week, Powers of X comes to an end too, and adds a dark context to Jonathan Hickman\u2019s already-fascinating time with the X-Men.\n\nIf House of X #6 was a hopeful herald of the new dawn of X-Men books that will follow this incredible event series, Powers of X #6 \u2014 for one last time, by the superstar team of Jonathan Hickman, R.B. Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, David Curiel, Clayton Cowles, and Tom Muller \u2014 exists to temper that new dawn in the crucible of context. Because, it turns out, all has not been as it seems in the many lives of Moira MacTaggert. And with the full picture unveiled, we learn a terrible truth that threatens to undercut all that she, Charles Xavier, and Magneto have worked for.\n\nPowers of X #6 is built around the revelation of three key truths. The first is relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. The reason Moira X has been hiding away in her own no-space, connected only by a secret chamber deep within Krakoa\u2019s tangled roots away from her fellow mutants, is that at this point in the timeline, she fears she has been too active in her influence of the current age that has brought about mutantkind\u2019s latest attempt at a sovereign nation. Having faked her death \u2014 not through a husk born of mutantkind\u2019s new capacity to resurrect their own, but a Shi\u2019ar golem \u2014 Moira has spent much of her 10th life in the shadows, known only to Professor X and Magneto as a living manipulator of all that has been laid out.\n\nMoira\u2019s reasoning for this return to secrecy is rooted in precognitive mutants, who she refuses to give a place to on Krakoa \u2014 including Destiny, who has yet to be revived from her own death in the long and winding timeline that is X-Men continuity by the Five, despite the fact that Charles and Xavier have won the seeming trust of Mystique with the promise to return her to life. It\u2019s not just Moira\u2019s brutal past with Destiny that shapes her choice, however. It\u2019s a fear of what those who can see the future will uncover.\n\nThe truth. A truth already shared to Charles and Erik, and a truth that nearly broke them \u2014 a truth that will break everything they have built on Krakoa if it ever got out.\n\nA truth long known to Erik, Charles, and Moira is revealed to us, the audience. (Image: R.B. Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, David Curiel, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nMutantkind loses. This timeline, the next, the one after that, no matter what Moira has done, no matter what price has been paid already, no matter what seeming apocalypse has already been averted. They lose. Even in this new life, where she has broken all the rules, and accomplished things that no mutant could ever be thought accomplished \u2014 a recognised sovereign state, a unity among not jut mutants we would consider heroes but the ones we consider villains too, for the good of their entire race \u2014 mutantkind will lose.\n\nIt\u2019s not to the machines \u2014 it seems, for now, they may have subverted at least that dark fate. It\u2019s not even to man, who as we\u2019ve seen is set to herald a future where what defines humanity is an incredibly fluid concept. If mutantkind is the evolutionary apex of Earth itself, a natural counterpoint to humanity\u2019s own growth, then what can they not comprehend to compete with?\n\nThe Librarian explains his plan. (Image: R.B. Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, David Curiel, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nThat\u2019s the twofold gutpunch of this second truth, revealed in flash-forwards to Powers of X\u2019s far-flung X\u00b3 timeline. Ever since it began unfolding, we\u2019ve been led by this series to make the assumption that X\u00b3 is the endgame Moira\u2019s audacious manipulation will lead to. A post-future where, with the aid of the mysterious Librarian and the X-Men\u2019s cosmically mechanical foes the Phalanx, the living memory of mutandtdom will merge with machine and be freed. Free of their bodies, free to transcend to a new, almost incomprehensible level of existence \u2014 at one with the very fabric of the cosmos itself.\n\nIt\u2019s not the endgame at all, as it turns out. It\u2019s not freedom, as the Librarian\u2019s true plan is revealed \u2014 he\u2019s not trying to save mutantkind. He never was. He\u2019s imprisoned them. The Librarian and his people are trying to ascend to godhood, using the imprisoned archive of mutant memory in the Worldmind (save for a captive Moira and Logan, those mysterious beings glimpsed at the very end of Powers of X #1 all those weeks ago) to draw the attention of the Phalanx as a stepping stone. Because, in actual fact, he is already beyond them. The Librarian\u2019s species is finally revealed as Homo Novissima.\n\nHomo Superior is dead. Long live Homo Novissima. (Image: R.B. Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, David Curiel, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nIf mutants are Homo Superior \u2014 the apex evolution of what humankind is \u2014 then Novissima is a fork in the genetic road, a post-human realisation where humanity has, through genetic manipulation and technology, taken hold of its own biological path. An evolutionary destiny beyond the apex of Homo Superior to create something new, and powerful, and victorious over humanity\u2019s long time foe, its almighty, all-powerful evolutionary counterpart. In the X\u00b3, Novissima has won, and is on the path to godhood while all that is left of mutantkind is consumed as fodder to fuel that transcendence.\n\nBut for all the twists and truths already being thrown at us in this issue, its third and final truth is the chance the X-Men need in this sea of despair. Because, after the Librarian revels in his plan to Moira and Logan in his garden of imprisoned mutants, it turns out X\u00b3 isn\u2019t the endgame. As the Librarian leaves to await transcendence, having cockily given his apparent lessers a chance in the gift of knowledge \u2014 of knowing Homo Novissima\u2019s plan \u2014 Logan kills him. Then he calmly turns to Moira, and has he has done so before, guts her with claws.\n\nHe\u2019s the best at what he does, forever and always. (Image: R.B. Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, and David Curiel, Marvel Comics)\n\nBecause X\u00b3 wasn\u2019t the future. It was a future. It was the sixth, previously unrevealed life of Moira MacTaggart, and unbeknown to us, it\u2019s already been influencing everything we\u2019ve seen in her 10th life, revealed in her very own journal. The miraculous flowers of Krakoa, being given as gifts to humankind to accelerate their lives, cure disease, and eradicate mental defects? They\u2019re meant to keep humanity docile, away from needing to manipulate its own genetic legacy on the path to what would become post-human. Her breaking down of Charles\u2019 optimism for co-operation is intended not just to forge him into the champion of mutantkind she needs to unite her species, but to break him of the idea that humanity could ever cooperate with a species whose destiny is to forever be their better.\n\nIn many ways, however, this context \u2014 as bleak as it is \u2014 just makes the hope Charles and Erik feel at the issue\u2019s end, their defiance, shine that much brighter. They knew the truth we as the audience now know too, and hoped anyway. They knew that Moira has doubts about their zeal \u2014 about their willingness to change, about whether or not her many lives of breaking down who these men have been, who they are, and who they will become, in order to save the entirety of mutantkind. They hoped anyway.\n\nThe have been told the X-Men will lose. That they will always lose, that, for all the cycles, for all the alternatives, that mutankind\u2019s future perpetually lies in defeat and persecution. But Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr still believe they can win \u2014 and as the dawn of brave new age of X-Men storytelling begins in earnest, they are ready to fight a battle unlike any they\u2019ve seen before to maintain that belief.\n\nHope, in spite of it all. (Image: R.B. Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, David Curiel, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nAfter all, as we\u2019ve learned previously in this duology, this is who the X-Men really are. Unabashedly themselves, in spite of it all. Unabashedly hopeful.\n\nThey\u2019ll need to be, to fight the greatest threat the X-Men have ever faced, in this life or the next.", "description": "Last week, House of X came to an end with its eyes toward the stars, a glimmer of hope in the face of a new age.
