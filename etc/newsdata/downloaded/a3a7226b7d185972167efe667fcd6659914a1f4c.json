It has continued to provide key support for gold since the price rally that initiated in late April 2019. We believe this level will act as a relatively strong price \u201cfloor\u201d going forward and any price activity below $1500 could represent a very opportunistic entry area for skilled traders.\n\nBack in early September, we authored this research post highlighting what we believed would happen going forward 30 to 60+ days for gold. At that time, the price of gold had just rallied above $1500 for the first time in 2019.\n\nWe alerted our followers that we believed gold would stall near the $1550 level, move briefly toward the $1475 to $1500 level, set up a new momentum base near the $1500 price level and begin a new rally soon after this base was complete.\n\nThis is gold's weekly chart from that September 2 research post. We still believe that research is accurate and that this new move below $1500 is an incredible opportunity for traders that understand the real potential of the future of precious metals.\n\nWeekly Gold\n\nThis 120-minute gold chart showing the early price decline on October 10, 2019 and highlighting the $1500 price support zone in RED illustrates how price has continued to find this level acting as strong support and how price has, in the past, moved through this level and back above it to form the new \u201cmomentum base/bottom\u201d near October 1, 2019.\n\nWe believe any move below $1500 (or more precisely \u2013 $1495) is a very strong entry point. Obviously, a price move to lower levels would be even better. Currently, as long as price stays above the Momentum Base level (near $1463), then we consider the October 1 price rotation the true momentum base \u201clow.\u201d\n\n2-Hour Gold\n\nThis daily chart highlights the same $1500 price support zone and clearly illustrates why we believe any price move below $1500 is a very strong opportunity for traders. Gold's next leg should push prices above $1700 (possibly higher). Longer-term, we believe the fear and uncertainty in the global markets will not subside until well after the 2020 US Presidential election cycle completes.\n\nDaily Gold\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nTherefore, we have at least 12 to 16+ months of continued fear driving investor uncertainty in precious metals and as the US political chaos heats up, so will precious metals. At this point, we believe gold has just started to \u201clift-off\u201d in terms of the ultimate upside potential over the longer term. We\u2019ve discussed the potential of gold reaching above $3750 and we think this target level is valid.\n\nOn Thursday I talked about how to trade and where gold, silver and miners were within their bull/bear market cycle, which may surprise you. Listen to my thoughts in this Podcast.\n\nPlay these moves accordingly. This may be the last time you see gold trading below $1500 for quite a while.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Chris Vermeulen covering: XAU/USD, XAG/USD, Gold Futures, Silver Futures.
