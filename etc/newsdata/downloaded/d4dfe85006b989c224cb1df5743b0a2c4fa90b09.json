It told The Times on Saturday that it would \"vigorously defend the lawsuit.\"\n\n\"We can confirm from our investigation that there was never a camera in the lavatory,\" Southwest Airlines said in a statement to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe airline also said the incident involved \"an inappropriate attempt at humor, which the company did not condone,\" but did not clarify what it meant by that, the Daily Mail said.\n\nFILE - This July 17, 2019 photo shows Southwest Airlines planes at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix.

Franklin, File) More\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSteinaker also said in the lawsuit that she and her husband, also a Southwest flight attendant, experienced what they believed was retaliation from managers.\n\nThey both kept working for the airline after filing the lawsuit, which claims that Southwest let the two pilots keep flying.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that she took a photo of the iPad display in the cockpit with her phone.\n\nSteinaker said the pilot who noticed her looking at it looked \"panicked\" when he realized. She says he acknowledged it was a livestream of the bathroom but said it was a secret security measure installed in the plane model, a Boeing 737-800.\n\nShe said both pilots immediately left the plane after it landed, which is against the airline's policy. Lawyers for the two pilots did not respond to The Times.\n\nNOW WATCH: Inside Roborace: the Formula One for self-driving cars", "description": "Renee Steinaker is suing Southwest, claiming she saw two pilots watching a livestream of the plane bathroom on an iPad in 2017.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4xUjEbJzlSeIM2gbVRzb2Q--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/db78d357a15bd38cf980fa89ffb1081c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
