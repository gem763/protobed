That was more than double the \u00a314.8 million loss it posted a year earlier, while revenue climbed 354%.\n\nBut the company added that its gross profit margin had improved despite the cost of sales jumping 247%, as that figure was lower than the rise in revenue. Revolut attributed the rise in costs to card scheme charges and user acquisition.\n\nRevolut started life in 2015 with a pre-paid card and app that let users spend abroad without paying high foreign exchange fees. It's since expanded its platform to include cryptocurrency trading and business accounts, and recently added share trading to its growing list of features.", "description": "Revolut said it recorded a \u00a332.8 million loss after tax in 2018, while revenues rose more than 350% to \u00a358.2 million.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106002960-1562246086864gettyimages-1027843464.jpeg?v=1562246331", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
