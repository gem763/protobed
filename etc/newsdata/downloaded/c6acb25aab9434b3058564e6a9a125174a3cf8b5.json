Zhang's office will enforce penalties against companies found to have lifted U.S. intellectual property, he said.\n\nThe announcement adds to a drumbeat of market-opening promises by the communist government, which is trying to make China's cooling, state-dominated economy more productive.\n\nBeijing also will ease restrictions on foreign competitors in some newly opened finance businesses, the Commerce Ministry said.\n\nComplaints about Beijing's technology ambitions helped to spark its tariff war with President Donald Trump.\n\nTRUMP: US-CHINA TRADE DEAL'S PHASE ONE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE\n\nTrade negotiators are working out details of an Oct. 11 agreement under which President Donald Trump delayed a planned tariff hike on Chinese imports. Trump said Beijing agreed to buy more American farm goods in exchange, though China has yet to confirm details of its commitment.\n\nBusiness groups welcomed the agreement as a possible step to breaking a deadlock in the 15-month-old conflict, though the two sides have yet to report progress on their core disputes over Beijing's trade surplus and technology policies.\n\nThose include complaints from Washington, Europe and other trading partners that Chinese development plans are based in part on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.\n\nAuthorities will be banned from \"explicitly or implicitly\" pressuring companies to give up technology, said a ministry official, Ye Wei.\n\nCHINA SAYS PART OF PHASE ONE TRADE DEAL WITH US 'BASICALLY COMPLETED'\n\nThat pledge, if carried out, builds on a law enacted in March that prohibits use of \"administrative tools\" to force companies to give up industrial secrets. Business groups said that might leave officials free to use other leverage.\n\n\"Administrative organs may not implicitly or explicitly force the transfer of technology by foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises,\" Ye said.\n\nThat still leaves open the question of foreign companies that are required to work through joint ventures with Chinese partners. For such ventures to function, the foreign partner often must hand over technology or teach a potential competitor how to develop its own.\n\nChina is trying to appeal to foreign companies, some of which have postponed or shifted investments to other countries out of concern about the impact of U.S. and Chinese tariff hikes.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nA ministry statement also promised to \"eliminate all restrictions on the scope of business\" of foreign banks, securities companies and fund managers. It pledged to \"remove the requirement on total assets\" for establishing a foreign-owned bank.\"We will move faster to open finance industries,\" said a deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen.\n\nWang gave no details, but business groups say high requirements for capital might keep foreign investors out of Chinese financial industries. They say restrictions on licensing and operations also might discourage potential competitors.\n\nBeijing has issued a series of market-opening promises over the past two years including abolishing limits on foreign ownership of companies in auto manufacturing, securities, banking, insurance and futures trading.\n\nFull foreign ownership of futures traders will be allowed as of Jan. 1, followed by mutual fund companies on April 1 and securities firms on Dec. 1. Until now, foreign investors have been limited to owning 51% of such businesses.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "China on Tuesday appeared eager to meet US demands in the trade negotiations, particularly on the thorny issue of intellectual property theft \u2014 a key irritant in its tariff war with Washington.", "authors": ["Alexander Lockie"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
