No side bar either. Can't scroll down. Nothing. Videos play alright, but I get nothing BUT the video.\n\n\n\nThis only JUST started happening in the last half hour. pic.twitter.com/OhvQk4Ja2b \u2014 Blackbird (@BlackbirdFrost) October 16, 2019\n\nViewers deprived of the ability to leave insightful, witty comments took to Twitter to vent their frustrations.\n\nMillennials scream at the top of their lungs, proclaiming that is is in fact, the End of the World #YouTubeDOWN\n\n\n\nThat is the news that is brought to you by me on today, the #PronounsDay\n\nMaybe a #Meltdown has occurred, or people are too busy with #TheMaskedSinger to care atm.\ud83d\ude12 \u2014 Hydro Nova (@TheHydroNova) October 17, 2019\n\nDeprived even of the opportunity to register their approval with a \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike,\u201d they complained about the \u201cfull of problems\u201d platform.\n\nI cant sleep unless I spend an hour scrolling through videos I don't have time to watch. #YouTubeDOWN \u2014 TonyTea (@tonytea) October 17, 2019\n\nIs anyone else having this problem where they go to watch a video on Youtube and u can't scroll down, or see recommendations on the side or even open up subscriptions? pic.twitter.com/xs2zDzGMN3 \u2014 Torie (@toriegarcia89) October 17, 2019\n\nThe YouTube platform is currently broken.
