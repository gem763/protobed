He was named a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, in 1991, and he won both the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize in 2011.\n\nCohen\u2019s last album, \u201cYou Want it Darker,\u201d was released shortly before his death in November 2016. It was produced by his son, who announced last year that he hoped to release several songs recorded about the same time.\n\n\u201cI was tasked with finishing a few more songs of his that we started together on the last album, so his voice is literally still in my life,\u201d he told CBC at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre and delicious entanglement.\n\n\u201cTo make a long story short, I believe that there are some really beautiful new songs of Leonard Cohen that no one\u2019s heard that are at some point going to come out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are these songs that exist that he wanted finished, these incredible powerful readings that were set to music. It\u2019s going to surprise and delight.\u201d\n\nThe title track of \u201cYou Want it Darker\u201d won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance in 2018. Cohen was previously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
