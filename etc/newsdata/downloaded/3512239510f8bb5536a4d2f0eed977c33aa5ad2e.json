Herro got bulldozed on Carter-Williams\u2019 path to score and was upset there was no offensive foul called. On the next play, however, Herro responded by hitting a 3-pointer, and then engaging with Carter-Williams in some fairly mild trash-talking on their way back down the court.\n\nTyler Herro not taking sh%^ from Michael Carter-Williams.

After the game, Heat veteran Jimmy Butler half-joked he would have liked to turn it into a teachable moment for his 19-year-old teammate.\n\n\u201cI want Tyler to know his ass should have got thrown out. If I was the ref I would have tossed his little ass, how dare you,\u201d Butler joked. \u201cNo, I like that energy, man. The world knows that\u2019s my dawg, he\u2019s doing it for the 414, I know all about it, I went to school over there. But if I was the ref, if I was Scott, I would have tossed his ass.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nJimmy Butler offers his take on Tyler Herro to @TheJaxShow and the rookie\u2019s ejection. pic.twitter.com/1Memj8zchJ \u2014 Will Manso (@WillManso) October 18, 2019\n\nHerro, the 13th overall pick, scored eight points in Miami\u2019s 107-98 win Thursday.
