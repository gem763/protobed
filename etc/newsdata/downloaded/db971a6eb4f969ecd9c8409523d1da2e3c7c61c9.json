looking to compete well against her on the day.\u201d\n\nKonta became the first British woman to reach the quarters at Flushing Meadows since Jo Durie in 1983.\n\nShe is bidding to become the first to make the semi-finals in each of the four grand slams in the Open era.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really pleased,\u201d she added. \u201cI think for me more on a personal level to be able to have made it to the quarters for my third slam in a row, I think that\u2019s a really, really big achievement for me. So I\u2019m really pleased with that.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m looking forward to keep going further and further. You know how I am, I take one match at a time. I don\u2019t really look forward too much more.\u201d\n\nSvitolina overcame Madison Keys in the fourth round, ending the American\u2019s unbeaten record in night matches in New York.\n\nOn her record against Konta, she said: \u201cTo be fair, they have all been very tough matches. She\u2019s a very tough opponent. She strikes the ball very good, and I have to react very quickly with my feet.\n\n\u201cI know a bit what to expect. I have been practicing a little bit with her. You know, I have to step on court and be focused on my game. That\u2019s my goal for the next match.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s a solid player. She plays always well in the grand slams. She\u2019s a top player. She\u2019s been in the top 10 and been playing very good tennis.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Johanna Konta needs to overcome another nemesis if she is to reach the semi-finals of the US Open.
