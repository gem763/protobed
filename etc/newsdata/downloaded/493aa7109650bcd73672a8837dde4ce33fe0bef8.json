He paid all of his expenses \u2014 state dinners, office staff, transportation, medical care and even furnishings \u2014 out of his own pocket.\n\n\n\nAfter leaving office in 1797, Washington complained bitterly about the hundreds of guests who showed up at Mount Vernon, expecting to be wined, dined, entertained and housed at his expense.\n\nSomehow, the idea of turning the presidency into a profit center never occurred to him.\n\nFrom the archives: The Founding Fathers would have impeached Trump in a New York minute\n\nNeither did it occur to Adams, Jefferson or Madison, who all had serious money troubles after they left office in the early 1800s, in part because of the expense of being president. Each of them lost a great part of their fortune in the Revolutionary War, and they lost more while in the presidency. But they kept their sacred honor intact.\n\nAccording to an article in American Heritage, it wasn\u2019t until the Civil War in the 1860s that the president was relieved of the responsibility of paying the salary of the servants and gardeners at the White House, although they still had to feed them until Harry Truman\u2019s time in office in the late 1940s.\n\nAfter Congress objected to John Adams spending some funds earmarked for furniture on carriages and horses, no president received funds for transportation around the country until William Howard Taft, who served from 1909 to 1913. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office 20 years after Taft\u2019s term ended, flew in his own private plane.\n\nCalvin Coolidge\n\nPresidents had free passage in public railroad cars for decades after the Civil War, but the assassination of William McKinley in 1901 led to a requirement that the president had to travel by private rail coach, which he paid for. Calvin Coolidge, in the Roaring \u201920s, had the very Trumpian idea of charging newsmen and Secret Service agents for the privilege of riding along.\n\nAlthough they are considered to be among our most pro-business presidents, in most respects, Coolidge was the opposite of Trump.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show off. He never mentioned his opponents by name. He struggled to restore the reputation of the White House after years of corruption. He liked immigrants. He declined to run for re-election. He was frugal not only with his own money but with the people\u2019s.\n\nAnd he was known as Silent Cal.\n\nRex Nutting is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "Trump will make a buck from the G-7 meeting.
