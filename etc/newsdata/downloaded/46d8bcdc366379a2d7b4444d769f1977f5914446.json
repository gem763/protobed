Valley is 40 miles from Porthmadog which is the next warmest place in the UK with the mercury hitting 25C.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite unusual to get temperatures into mid to high twenties at this time of the year,\u201d Mark Wilson, a meteorologist at the Met Office told The Independent.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThe average for this time of year in this part of the world is 16C so the fact it\u2019s 10 degrees warmer than the average is pretty impressive.\"\n\nHowever, it is not unprecedented. The highest temperature in September came from Bawtry in south Yorkshire where temperatures reached 35.6C on 2 September 1906.\n\n\u201cWe think today is going to be the peak of the sunshine and very high temperatures,\u201d said Mr Wilson.\n\n\u201cFrom tonight and through tomorrow it becomes a lot more unsettled throughout the UK as we see a breakdown of the weather into showers or longer spells of rain. This will happen tonight and into Sunday. \u201c\n\nShape Created with Sketch. UK heatwave rolls in as temperatures soar Show all 44 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Meteorologist say the category three storm has left Bermuda and is travelling across the Atlantic towards the UK.\n\nMuch of the tropical weather system has dissipated but it is still likely to bring an area of low pressure that will see an end to the current pleasant conditions.\n\nMeteorologist Becky Mitchell said:\u201dThere is a lot set to change tonight. We have got some heavy rainfall coming, mainly in the west. It will come in from Northern Ireland, Wales and western parts of England.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Some of these weather systems are the remnants of hurricane Humberto.\u201d\n\nThe meteorologist said that the warm air from the continent that caused Saturday\u2019s sunny weather is likely cause more rain as these two weather systems collide.\n\n\u201cIt means it\u2019s quite a moist atmosphere, which often brings some heavier rain. The outlook into the start of October does look to stay largely changeable,\u201d she said.\n\nThe highest recorded temperature last September was 26.5C (80F) at Cambridge Botanic Gardens.", "description": "The UK is enjoying the last rays of summer sun with temperatures topping 27C at Valley near Holyhead in Wales \u2013 more than 10C higher than average for this time of year.\u00a0 The unseasonably warm weather is due to a high pressure system and warm southerly winds.\u00a0Valley\u00a0is 40 miles from Porthmadog which is the next warmest place in the UK with the mercury hitting 25C.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/21/16/pri85990047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
