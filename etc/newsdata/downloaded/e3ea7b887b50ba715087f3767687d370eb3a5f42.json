Commuters pulled her out alive.", "language": "en", "text": "All Pamela Ivy could think to do in the few seconds before the subway train hit was scream.\n\nA man had jumped onto the tracks of a New York City subway station. And he was holding a girl.\n\nIf the 5-year-old cried out in those moments before impact, Ivy says she did not hear it. The child was drowned out again as she crawled from under the train \u2014 hair a bit bloodied, knees a bit bruised, according to police, wearing a blue vest and pink backpack \u2014 amid the cries of a rush-hour crowd of commuters reeling at a father\u2019s suicide and stunned by his daughter\u2019s survival.\n\n\u201cOh, my God,\u201d one woman says, her voice breaking, in a moment caught on video.\n\n\u201cLittle by little, my love, little by little,\u201d she yells out.\n\nA man who jumped down onto the tracks hoists the girl up onto the platform. That\u2019s when someone took the child away, Ivy said. They didn\u2019t want her to see her father\u2019s body.\n\nThe man, a 45-year-old Bronx resident named Fernando Balbuena-Flores, died on the scene Monday morning, according to New York police. But the girl, who has not been named, went to a Bronx medical center with only minor injuries and was released to her mother in stable condition.\n\nThat evening, Ivy was still wondering at the miracle that emerged from tragedy. Ivy felt sure that both father and daughter were dead. She\u2019d seen the wheels of the southbound No. 4 train \u2014 already slowing to a stop, she said \u2014 roll over Balbuena-Flores\u2019s head. People beside Ivy wailed and covered their faces.\n\nBut the girl apparently fit beneath the wheels, she said.\n\nIvy was also wondering at the moments that led up to the death. She told The Washington Post that she heard Balbuena-Flores speak on the phone just before he jumped, having what sounded like a normal conversation between husband and wife. He said he was taking his daughter to school, she recalled. She remembers a mention of other children and the words, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nPolice said it\u2019s not yet clear why the man jumped. New York police Sgt. Lee Jones confirmed that Balbuena-Flores made a phone call shortly before his death but said the details of the call are not yet clear.\n\nAn assistant superintendent of the Bronx building Balbuena-Flores lived in, Anthony Woods, remembered a father who took his daughter to the park three times a day. \u201cWherever he goes, she goes,\u201d he told the New York Times.\n\nThe operator of the train is being treated for trauma, the Times reported, citing transit union representatives.\n\nIt was a \u201ctraumatic event for everyone involved,\u201d Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Shams Tarek said in a statement.\n\nAs the horror unfolded at about 8 a.m., some sprang into action.\n\nAntonio Love, 32, told the Times he ran to help when he heard screaming. Video shows Love crouching down on the tracks with another man to grab the girl as she emerges from under the train.\n\nLove told the Times that the girl, crying, said only, \u201cPapa, my papa.\u201d Speaking later at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx \u2014 where the two good Samaritans went with minor injuries, according to the New York Fire Department \u2014 Love questioned many onlookers\u2019 decisions that morning to whip out cellphones rather than pitch in.\n\n\u201cIt was just panicking,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, regular New Yorkers, pulling out their phones. Really?\u201d\n\nSomeone stole his bag as he helped the girl to safety, he said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time a parent has jumped onto the New York subway tracks with a child \u2014 nor the first time someone has emerged relatively unscathed. Last June, a mother and her 2-month-old son survived the woman\u2019s leap in front of a train at another Bronx station.\n\nA witness of that incident told the New York Post that the pair survived because the train, already slowing, rolled entirely above them.\n\n\u201cShe was lying in the middle of the track bed clutching the baby in her arms,\u201d a transit worker told the New York Post. \u201cYou knew they were alive because you could hear the baby crying. There was nothing to clean up. No blood, nothing.\u201d\n\nTrain collisions with people on subway tracks or platforms have been increasing in recent years, according to data from the MTA. They went up from 168 in 2016 to 189 last year. There were more than 100 collisions this year as of mid-July.\n\nDeaths from the incidents have risen, too, from 48 three years ago to 68 in 2018. Thirty-two people died after contact with a train in 2019 as of July 22, the MTA says.\n\nRead more:\n\nThis back-to-school PSA from Sandy Hook Promise is a punch in the gut\n\nShe left a can of dry shampoo in her car.
