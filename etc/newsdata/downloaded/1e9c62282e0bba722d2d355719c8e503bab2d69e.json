The growing trend of raising chickens and other poultry for eggs and companionship is linked to an outbreak that has sickened people in 49 states, according to federal health officials.\n\nThe CDC said Friday it had recorded another 235 illnesses in August, bringing to 1,003 the count of those sickened by salmonella related to home-raised chickens, hens, ducks and turkeys. That puts the country on track to exceed all of 2017's toll \u2014 the largest recorded by the CDC \u2014 when 1,120 people got sick and one person died from contact with backyard poultry.\n\n\"The ongoing multistate outbreak of salmonella linked to backyard poultry is the largest we've seen this year to date,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told CBS MoneyWatch in July.\n\nThe salmonella tallies vastly underestimate actual illnesses, given for every case reported, another 29 are not, a CDC calculation that would put this year's illness count from salmonella attributable to backyard flocks at more than 29,000 people, with four months remaining in the year.\n\nEspecially troubling is nearly a quarter, or 24%, of the illnesses this year involve kids. \"Young kids are more likely to kiss, cuddle or snuggle with poultry and then may not wash their hands as thoroughly,\" Dr. Megin Nichols, an epidemiologist in the CDC's outbreak response and prevention branch, said in a July 30 phone interview.\n\nSilicon Valley chickens part of growing backyard coop trend\n\nAbout 10 million U.S. homes have backyard poultry\n\n\n\nThe trouble stems in large part from a lack of public education about an increasingly popular activity. Roughly 10 million, or 8%, of U.S. households had chickens in 2018, with ownership higher among households with young children, according the American Pet Producers Association, an industry trade group.\n\nThose with or considering backyard poultry would be wise to check out the CDC's guidelines. They include advising against eating or drinking while near an outside flock, and always washing hands with soap and running water after touching birds. Those with young children should be especially mindful, as kids want to touch birds with hands that often then get put in their mouths.\n\nMany of those interviewed in outbreaks are first-time poultry owners unaware the animals can carry germs, according to the CDC's Nichols. There's also a mistaken notion that if an animal is healthy, it can't carry salmonella, when in reality chickens can carry salmonella in their gut without it harming them, she said.\n\nAnother notion that the CDC would like to dispel is the idea that all chickens have salmonella, a falsehood that prompts people to feed the animals antibiotics, which then can cause resistant and more virulent strains of salmonella bacteria.", "description": "Raising chickens at home is the top cause of infection blamed for 1,003 illnesses in 49 states, including two deaths", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/d0b39f29-f147-4129-9121-b764080dec69/thumbnail/1200x630/9d117953888b8655b2f71923da56a713/salmonellapoultry-456px.jpg"}
