The video, originally posted last Saturday, has already earned more than 2 million views.\n\nIn the footage, Browning is shown arguing with Cristina Riofrio, a 19-year-old student at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Riofrio, who was born in California to parents from Ecuador, was speaking Spanish to her friends when the confrontation began.\n\n\"I worked years \u2014 here \u2014 to be in this f***ing country,\" Browning says. \"What'd you do? Come over on a f***ing boat?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn america, i can speak FUCKING spanish if i want to pic.twitter.com/a6F93RftAR \u2014 Cristina Riofrio (@cristinariofri3) September 22, 2019\n\n\"Shut up! Shut the f*** up!\" he goes on to say before telling Riofrio she needs to speak English inside the restaurant.\n\nRiofrio, who posted the video with the caption \"In America, I can speak f***ing Spanish if I want to,\" responds to Browning's comments by calling him a racist.\n\n\"I know I am,\u201d Browning answers. \"Speak English.\"\n\nAt the end of the video, an employee can be heard asking Browning to leave, but the footage does not show him exiting the restaurant. Riofrio told WSAV-TV she wishes she had said more during the confrontation.\n\n\"I wish I could have said a lot of things, but at that time I was really mad and I couldn\u2019t even speak,\" the 19-year-old told the station.\n\nShe added that despite her anger, she wanted to remain strong for her friends, some of whom were rattled by the encounter.\n\n\"Actually one of my friends cried at that moment \u2014 I felt really bad for her,\" Riofrio told WSAV-TV. \"But, I didn't want him to see us cry, see us as weak, acting weak, because we are not.\"\n\nThousands of Twitter users replied to the video, offering support for Riofrio and express their outrage.\n\n\"Spanish is beautiful, your heritage is beautiful, you & your friends & loved ones are beautiful. Stay strong, we're on your side,\" one user replied.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you went through this. I\u2019m sorry so many Spanish speakers go through this - it\u2019s not right. Spanish is beautiful, your heritage is beautiful, you & your friends & loved ones are beautiful.
