China Sea map", "language": "en", "text": "Hanoi (AFP) \u2013 Vietnam has pulled the animated film \u201cAbominable\u201d from theatres over a scene featuring a map of the South China Sea showing Beijing\u2019s claims in the flashpoint waterway, state media reported Monday.\n\nChina has long used its so-called nine-dash line to justify its jurisdiction over most of the resource-rich sea, often to the displeasure of Hanoi which also claims parts of the waterway.\n\nThe U-shaped line appears on a map of the South China Sea in a scene in the film \u2014 released as \u201cEverest: The Little Snowman\u201d in Vietnam \u2014 which is about a Chinese teenager helping a yeti return to his home on Mount Everest.\n\nState media said the movie \u2014 a joint production from DreamWorks and China\u2019s Pearl Studio \u2014 would no longer be shown in Vietnam, where it was released on October 4.\n\n\u201cI will claim responsibility\u201d for the mistake, said Nguyen Thu Ha, the head of Vietnam\u2019s Cinema Department, according to Thanh Nien newspaper.\n\nAll films in the one-party state must be approved by communist censors who screen for gratuitous violence, suggestive sex scenes or politically-sensitive material.\n\nHa said she would remind her department \u201cto be very vigilant\u2026 to be more prudent\u201d in the future.\n\nPhotos of the faux pas circulated on social media Monday, showing the scene featuring the nine-dash line crossed out with a red \u201cX\u201d along with angry comments.\n\n\u201cPlease sack the person in charge of censorship for this movie,\u201d said Facebook user Pham Tan Phong.\n\nAnother said: \u201cWe cannot accept these blatant acts, especially regarding sensitive things like the current sea disputes\u201d.\n\nVietnam\u2019s censorship department refused to comment on the issue Monday, and DreamWorks did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina claims the majority of the South China Sea, often invoking its so-called nine-dash line as a supposed historical justification to the waters, which are a key global shipping route.\n\nThough some films are barred from viewing in Vietnam where free speech is tightly controlled, others are approved for screening with significant edits.\n\nThe popular 2018 romantic comedy \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d saw a few snips. One of the cut scenes featured a designer bag with a map of the world showing disputed South China Sea islands under Beijing\u2019s control.\n\nThis year\u2019s hit \u201cJoker\u201d, starring Joaquin Phoenix, was also trimmed to exclude a scene of supporters rallying around the DC Comics villain \u2014 possibly to avoid any suggestion of a popular uprising or personality cult.", "description": "Hanoi (AFP) \u2013 Vietnam has pulled the animated film \u201cAbominable\u201d from theatres over a scene featuring a map of the South China Sea", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/8ad4e2_abominable-released-as-everest-snoman-in-vietnam-is-chinese-teen-helping-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
