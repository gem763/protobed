It has spread to infect almost 3,000 people in Congo so far, killing two-thirds of them.\n\nIn the survivor study, published on Wednesday in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, scientists led by Ibrahima Soc\u00e9 Fall, an emergency response expert at the World Health Organization, followed 1,130 Guinean survivors of the 2013-16 outbreak.\n\nOver a follow-up period of an average of 22 months, 59 deaths were reported, of which 37 were tentatively attributed to renal failure based on reports by family members of the symptoms suffered by their dead loved one, the researchers said.\n\nIt was not possible to give the exact cause or date of death for many patients, they said, since there were few medical documents or autopsies available. Case studies of patients with Ebola, however, have found that the virus can be detected in urine - showing it can infect the kidney - and that some patients with Ebola develop acute kidney injury.\n\n\u201cAlthough cause of death evidence was weak for most patients, renal failure is a biologically plausible cause of death in survivors of Ebola virus disease,\u201d said Mory Keita, a medical doctor and epidemiologist from Guinea who is now working with the WHO to help control the Congo Ebola outbreak.\n\nJudith Glynn of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who also worked on the research team, said the findings should help emergency response experts focus resources towards higher-risk groups. \u201cThose hospitalised with Ebola for longer may be at greater risk, and could be specifically targeted,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest and deadliest ever, killing more than 11,300 people of the 28,000 who were infected.", "description": "People who survive Ebola virus infection face a dramatically higher risk of dying - probably from severe kidney damage - within a year of leaving hospital, according to a study of survivors of an epidemic in Guinea.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426330597&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832I0"}
