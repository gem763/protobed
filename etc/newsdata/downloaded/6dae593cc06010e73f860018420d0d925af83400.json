The Ukrainian president then tells Trump he would like to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles, which the U.S. first sold to Ukraine last year. Trump replies by saying, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d He goes on to mention CrowdStrike, the U.S.-based technology company that investigated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016, and former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nLater in the conversation, Trump asks Zelensky to work with Attorney General William Barr to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of corruption claims against former Vice-President Joe Biden and his son, according to the memo. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump says.\n\nIt is unclear what has been left out of the memo, in which Trump also discusses the investigation into the 2016 election, and sending his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine. Among the other notable parts of the conversation is Zelensky telling Trump that last time was in the U.S., he stayed at a Trump property.
