NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute\n\nSaturn is a giant and ancient planet, likely some 4.6 billion years old, with rings and moons that astronomers have long thought formed around the same time.\n\nBut a new study in the Astrophysical Journal suggests the moons closest to Saturn appeared a mere 100 million years ago \u2014 long after dinosaurs first walked the Earth.\n\nAstronomers based their conclusion on computer simulations and data from NASA's Cassini satellite, which still observes Saturn and its cornucopia of 62 moons.\n\nThe mystery began sometime around 2012. That's when French astronomers noticed the orbits of Saturn's moons were changing too quickly to be billions of years old.\n\nThe researchers based their eyebrow-raising idea on tidal effects, or the gravitational tug-of-war between fluids deep inside planets and their moons.\n\nTidal forces can warm up the interiors of moons to melt ice, as they do inside Saturn's moon Enceladus, for example \u2014 causing that world to spew water into space through geysers on its surface. Over the eons, though, this saps orbital energy and causes a moon to drift farther and farther away from its planet.\n\nIn the new study, Matija Cuk, an astronomer with the SETI Institute and Southwest Research Institute, and his colleagues modeled these complex interactions around Saturn using computers. The researchers specifically focused on orbital resonances: when the orbits of two or more moons sync up, boosting even a small moon's gravitational tug on its neighbors to tilt and elongate its neighbors' orbits.\n\nGeysers on Enceladus shoot water ice into space. YouTube/NASA When the researchers factored Enceladus' water geysers into their simulations \u2014 again, caused by the complex gravitational dance of moons around Saturn \u2014 the results suggested the moon would have to be about 100 million years old to be in its current location, along with nearby moons. (The more-distant Titan and Iapetus moons are probably much older.)\n\nThis may mean that most of Saturn's inner moons (those inside the orbit of Titan), and possibly even its rings, formed during the Cretaceous period \u2014 the first of the three periods when dinosaurs ruled the Earth. And if the moons are truly that young, then Jurassic-Period dinosaurs like Brachiosaurs and Stegosaurus predated them.\n\nThe researchers also suggest Saturn's inner moons formed violently, after an older set of moons crashed into each other.\n\n\"Eventually, the orbits of neighboring moons crossed,\" Cuk said in a SETI press release, \"and these objects collided. From this rubble, the present set of moons and rings formed.\"\n\nWhat's more, Saturn may soon get more moons. Back in 2014, for example, Cassini observed a 750-mile-long icy object carving out a section of the planet's outermost A-ring, possibly evidence of a new moon in formation.\n\nSo while enormous lizards battled on the surface of Earth, Saturn's moons were engaged in an even more chaotic battle of flying space objects, smashing into each other above the gaseous clouds of their planet.", "description": "The planet's inner moons were formed in total chaos.", "authors": ["Sean Kane"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/56f81516dd08955d6a8b464c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2016-03-27"}
