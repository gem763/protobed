Is this really where NBN should be spending taxpayer dollars?\u201d\n\nBut Communications Minister Paul Fletcher has endorsed NBN\u2019s move into the enterprise market. He said last month it was a core part of NBN\u2019s mission.\n\nFletcher also would like to see increased infrastructure competition in fibre networks.\n\n\u201cJust to be abundantly clear, the government has no plans to revisit the commercial agreements or migration arrangements in the fixed-line footprint,\u201d he said in a speech last week. \u201cThat train has well and truly left the station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it is equally clear, the decisions originally made to support a monopoly broadband network have had significant consequences for market structure and competition. Since the NBN was announced, investment in fixed-line last-mile infrastructure by the private sector has fallen sharply.\u201d\n\nTelstra chairman John Mullen says Australia has some of the highest wholesale broadband pricing in the world. David Rowe\n\nThe minister\u2019s speech has caused confusion because former telecommunications minister Malcolm Turnbull banned fibre providers such as TPG Telecom from extending their networks to offer fibre to the basement services for retail customers.\n\nAnother point of confusion in the telco sector is the ACCC\u2019s approach to competition in mobiles.\n\nACCC\u2019s ban on the merger of Vodafone\u2019s Australian business and TPG Telecom was because of concerns that a three-player market would lessen competition. Sims says there is a \u201creal chance\u201d TPG will build a fourth mobile network if the merger is not allowed to go ahead.\n\nTPG founder David Teoh says he won\u2019t build a fourth network. The final determination of the ban relies on federal court judge John Middleton, who presided over a three-week trial and is due to hand down a decision in February.\n\nTelstra chief executive Andy Penn warned on Tuesday that most telcos in Australia had a return on invested capital below the cost of capital. He hinted this was because no company could make any money from selling retail services on the NBN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnless the economics of the industry are allowed to improve, the consequence will be lower investment and poorer quality networks similar to that you see in many international markets today. Competition is intense in our industry in both fixed and mobile,\u201d Penn told the Telstra annual meeting.\n\nPenn clearly disagrees with the ACCC view that Australia\u2019s mobile market is not competitive and needs a fourth player.\n\n\u201cThe last few years, in particular, has seen increasing data allowances and other inclusions for customers as well as falling prices,\u201d he said.\n\nOpposition communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland added to the pressure on the ACCC when she told a conference in Melbourne the Australian mobile market was delivering good value for customers.\n\nShe appeared to back the Vodafone merger with TPG when she said the mobile industry needed \u201coptimal scale, infrastructure synergies and balance sheets capable of delivering ongoing investment\u201d.\n\nIn his speech to the Telstra annual meeting, Mullen said NBN\u2019s move to sell fibre connections to big business seemed inequitable and he repeated an earlier criticism that NBN\u2019s wholesale pricing was too high. He said Australia had some of the most expensive broadband prices in the world.\n\nHe said NBN\u2019s move to compete with Telstra and others for fibre connections to business was \u201ca waste of collective resources\u201d, delaying investment in rolling out consumer services and duplicating existing high-speed fibre for no service or speed advantage.\n\nHowever, Mullen should be careful what he wishes for.\n\nIf the government were to revisit the entire structure of NBN and its commercial relationships with Telstra it could threaten infrastructure payments from NBN to Telstra, which are likely to rise to about $1 billion a year.", "description": "NBN Co's move into selling fibre to business customers has drawn attention to the messy and confusing policy settings in the telecommunications sector.
