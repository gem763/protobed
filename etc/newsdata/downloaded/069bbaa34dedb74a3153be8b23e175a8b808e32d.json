Former senator and secretary of state William Cohen gave it to her sister, Robbie McCauley, after a shooting at the Holocaust Museum. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nThis summer, Anita Henderson, a retired District schoolteacher, was going through her Silver Spring basement with an eye toward downsizing. Hanging in a closet was something she hadn\u2019t thought about for a while but something she didn\u2019t want anyone to forget.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a Windbreaker-type jacket,\u201d Henderson told me. \u201cWhen I saw it, I said, \u2018My goodness. That\u2019s Mr. Cohen\u2019s jacket.\u2019 And everything just started coming back.\u201d\n\nThis is the story of that jacket and how it ended up on the shoulders of Henderson\u2019s sister, Robbie McCauley , a performer, playwright and retired Emerson College professor who lives in Boston. In 2009, McCauley was in Washington to direct \u201cAnne and Emmett,\u201d a play written by Janet Langhart Cohen , who is married to William Cohen, the former U.S. senator and secretary of defense.\n\n\u201cAnne and Emmett\u201d is about an imagined meeting between Anne Frank and Emmett Till. It was to have its premiere at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on June 10, 2009. That afternoon, as Langhart Cohen was being driven to the museum, a gunman burst in, killing security guard Stephen Tyrone Johns.\n\nWilliam Cohen: \u201cFive or six shots were fired right away. . . . [Afterward], everybody had been evacuated from the building except me and the actors and Robbie. None of us could leave. I had to give a statement to what I had seen.\u201d\n\nCohen, McCauley and others were ushered by security personnel to the back of the museum.\n\nRobbie McCauley: \u201cIn fact, it was Senator Cohen who said, \u2018Go that way.\u2019 And he very quickly explained to me what had happened. He himself had been coming down the [entrance] steps while the shooting was happening.\n\n\u201cI remember being really panicked and breathing hard. . . . I remember Senator Cohen saying to me, \u2018Just calm down.\u2019 I was shaking. I think it was air-conditioned, and I was shaking. And he gave me his jacket.\u201d\n\nThe black jacket was a men\u2019s XL. Embroidered on the front were the words \u201cHead. Intelligence.\u201d\n\nCohen: \u201cFor a number of years I served on the board of Head Sports. One of their [tennis] rackets was called the Intelligence. . . . I had forgotten all about that.\u201d\n\nAnita Henderson: \u201cWhen she came home after the incident, apparently she just put the jacket down. Then it got in my basement closet.\u201d\n\nMcCauley: \u201cI didn\u2019t find out until later who the guard who was shot was. And I remembered him, because he was such a nice man.\u201d\n\nJanet Langhart Cohen: \u201cHow ironic, how sad, that here we are in the 21st century, thinking that all of that hatred, racism and anti-Semitism are behind us, or at least underground, but here a neo-Nazi gets out of his car at a Jewish shrine, and he kills a black man.\u201d\n\nMcCauley: \u201cRight now things are just shockingly surprising in terms of the public discourse and public events around these issues. I\u2019m hoping that this is just revealing something that has always been there and that, now it\u2019s more public, we can begin to change for the better.\u201d\n\nLanghart Cohen: \u201cYou think that these racist and anti-Semitic notions will die out. We look to the young and think, \u2018Well, the old ones will die, and new ones will come.\u2019 Then you remember Dylann Roof and what happened at the border in El Paso recently. Young people have had this hate passed on to them.\u201d\n\nCohen: \u201cJust a few months ago, we were going to Baltimore to see a new production at Morgan State University and a pop-up came up on our phones saying there had been another [synagogue] shooting. It was actually six months to the day that a shooting had taken place [at a synagogue] in Pennsylvania. This one was out in California.\u201d\n\nLanghart Cohen: \u201cSadly, that day, it\u2019s timeless in a way. Racism and anti-Semitism are the gifts that keep on giving. You talk about that happening then, compared to where we are now, and it seems like the now and then have always been. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I wrote the play \u2018Anne and Emmett.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHenderson: \u201cThere was a lot of news around the [Holocaust Museum] incident. Some of it is beginning to fade with time. . . . I think that\u2019s what made me think about how things have not really changed a lot.\u201d\n\nMcCauley: \u201c[My sister] is one of those people who wants everything in its place. She\u2019s a cleaner-upper in a way I wish I were. So she\u2019s been talking for years about: \u2018Well, we have this jacket. Why don\u2019t we try to get it back to him?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor 10 years, the jacket was hanging in Henderson\u2019s basement, protected by a plastic bag. Clipped to it was an envelope with news clippings about the shooting. Together, they represented a reminder of that awful day.\n\nIn August, Henderson asked if I might help reunite the jacket with its owner. Last month, I picked it up at her home. This week, I dropped it off at Cohen\u2019s office.\n\nBye for now\n\nI\u2019m taking a little break. I should be back in this space on Oct. 14. Be well.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Things haven\u2019t changed since the 2009 shooting at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0fQFN6B-esFQJ0RRweYvC81LdYY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JCCNZJHFEII6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
