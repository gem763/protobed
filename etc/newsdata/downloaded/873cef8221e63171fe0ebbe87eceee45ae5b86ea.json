(AP) - Jalen Ramsey arrived for the season in the back of an armored truck , sending a clear message to the Jacksonville Jaguars about his worth.\n\nIt would be fitting if he departed in a dump truck, assuming the Jaguars (0-2) unload their disgruntled defender.\n\nWithout saying why or providing much insight, Ramsey confirmed Tuesday that he wants out of Jacksonville and said he doesn\u2019t want to be a distraction as Jacksonville prepares to host Tennessee (1-1) on Thursday night.\n\nHe said his angst has nothing to do with the franchise declining to offer him a contract extension before this season, but hinted that the coaching staff has failed to use him properly.\n\nRamsey took two shots at Jaguars coach Doug Marrone, saying \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d twice when asked about the sideline argument between the two during a 13-12 loss at Houston on Sunday. Marrone uttered the same phrase after the game.\n\nRamsey\u2019s agent called general manager Dave Caldwell a short time later and requested a trade. The plea became public the following day.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about something in regards to that,\u201d Ramsey said during a 16-minute interview that added more confusion to an already-awkward situation. \u201cI didn\u2019t leak that information. Me and my agent, we are not the ones who leaked that information. And I was very strict about that because I did not want it to get out.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a distraction. I didn\u2019t want everybody asking my teammates all type of questions throughout the week.\u201d\n\nRamsey, who said he hasn\u2019t spoken to Marrone since the outburst, said he expects to play against the Titans - unless he\u2019s traded. It could be a chance for Jacksonville to showcase one of the league\u2019s best cornerbacks on national television.\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m a part of this team, that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to get from me,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m a part of this team, I hope they go out there and beat the hell out of people. I hope they win every game as long as I\u2019m a part of this team. I got nothing but love for every player on this team; they go out there and play their (butt) off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got good vibes. I love that locker room. Good vibes.\u201d\n\nTwo teammates, linebacker Myles Jack and cornerback Josh Robinson, stood in the back of the room to support Ramsey.\n\n\u201cI hope and pray they don\u2019t trade his (butt) and he stays here the whole time,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI hope he stays here through his fifth year and they tag him and he stays here forever. But that\u2019s not my choice. We\u2019ll see what the front office does.\u201d\n\nTwo other teammates told The Associated Press the trade request had as much to do with the direction of the franchise than anything else. The players spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the conversations.\n\nThey said Ramsey is one of several players currently questioning front-office decisions since Tom Coughlin was hired as the team\u2019s top football executive in 2017.\n\nJacksonville chose not to re-sign receiver Allen Robinson and cornerback Aaron Colvin last year, parted ways with safety Tashaun Gipson in March and failed to reach an extension with defensive end Yannick Ngakoue, who ranks third in franchise history with 29\u00bd sacks.\n\nMeanwhile, they opted to give huge contracts to quarterback Blake Bortles, guard Andrew Norwell and center Brandon Linder. They already cut Bortles, who counts $15.5 million against the 2019 salary cap. And they\u2019re essentially stuck with Norwell and Linder, who have missed time with injuries and fallen well short of expectations.\n\n\u201cIt is a business at the end of the day,\u201d running back Leonard Fournette said. \u201cI totally understand where he\u2019s coming from; he\u2019s all about winning. I talked to him. It\u2019s only two weeks into the season. When losing happens like that, it feels like it\u2019s going on Week 8. It challenges us as men and as players.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say he comes with a lot of baggage, but he is one of the key parts of our team.\u201d\n\nJacksonville has lost 12 of its past 14 games, and Ramsey has been a focal point in the past two.\n\nHe allowed two touchdowns to Sammy Watkins in a season-opening loss to Kansas City, abandoning his zone on one and getting beat in man-to-man coverage on the other. He also took a poor angle on the first of Watkins\u2019 three scores.\n\nRamsey rebounded with one of the best games in his four-year career at Houston last week, but his play was overshadowed by his public protest.\n\nRamsey was visibly upset that Marrone didn\u2019t challenge DeAndre Hopkins\u2019 first-down catch late in the first quarter. Ramsey yelled at Marrone as he walked off the field and appeared to put his hands on the head coach. Marrone responded by getting in Ramsey\u2019s face and screaming.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an elite player,\u201d defensive coordinator Todd Wash said. \u201cObviously I think some stuff gets misconstrued about how he\u2019s a hothead. He\u2019s just very competitive. It doesn\u2019t matter what he does, he wants to win.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jalen Ramsey arrived for the season in the back of an armored truck , sending a clear message to the Jacksonville Jaguars about his worth.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/jaguars_ramsey_football_74784_c0-118-2829-1767_s1770x1032.jpg?9784e57d7bb6a13105796d8fe7857fd70ee575a3", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
