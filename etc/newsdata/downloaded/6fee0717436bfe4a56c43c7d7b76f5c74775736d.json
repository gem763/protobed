The women\u2019s teams could pick two contracted England players each.\n\nThe names of the franchises were also confirmed and the kits were made public for the first time. The tournament is being sponsored by KP Nuts and each team bears the logo of one of their brands with KP Nuts on the shirts of the Oval Invincibles, which should keep Kevin Pietersen happy, and Hula Hoops on the Western Fire. Chris Woakes was wearing a red and pink shirt with Butterkist popcorn emblazoned across the front as the icon player for the Birmingham Phoenix while England captains Eoin Morgan and Heather Knight will play at the Lord\u2019s franchise, the London Spirit, sponsored by Tyrrell\u2019s crisps, the suitably upmarket brand in the KP stable.", "description": "England\u2019s World Cup winners lined up to support the Hundred on Thursday as the first confirmed details of the competition were finally announced.", "authors": ["Nick Hoult", "Cricket News Correspondent", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/03/20191003_ICC100_Hero-Group-Shot_548-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_7MUjyxDAwJSDH0jX-IZMnriSDBJLk4drmmwSgN8RCw.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
