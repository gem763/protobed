Our review just went live, and if you already preordered, there\u2019s a decent chance that you may have already received your new phone. But if you\u2019re still thinking about taking the plunge, there\u2019s a really good reason why you should do so today: it\u2019s the last day to get a bunch of preorder incentives with the purchase of a Note 10.\n\nThe good news is that you can get these deals no matter where you buy the phone \u2014 just so long as you do it today. If you want to buy the phone unlocked, you can do so through Samsung. Otherwise, I\u2019ve listed everywhere else you can buy the Note 10 here, and it includes any and all special offers happening at popular retailers and through carriers.\n\nThe first part of the deal applies to those who have a phone to trade. Samsung is offering up to $600 in trade-in credit for your current phone toward the Note 10, assuming it\u2019s one of the following devices, and it\u2019s in good condition. (You\u2019ll still get credit for a lesser phone, just not as much):\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10 E, S10, S10 Plus\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9\n\niPhone X, XR, or XS\n\nGoogle Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL\n\nAdditionally, buying the Note 10 today will get you a $100 Samsung gift card that can be used on anything from its online store. You\u2019ll get a $150 gift card if you buy the Note 10 Plus or Note 10 Plus 5G.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to register your phone after it arrives through the Shop Samsung app on Android or iOS to get the gift card. In the app, sign in with your Samsung account, then tap the tab called \u201coffers\u201d in the app. Click the \u201cpreorder & get more\u201d window, then tap \u201cSee if I\u2019m eligible\u201d and proceed with registering your phone there.", "description": "The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 releases tomorrow, August 23rd.
