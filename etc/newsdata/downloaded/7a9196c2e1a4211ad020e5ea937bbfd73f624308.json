The man was superb.\n\nIn the Baylor game - the entire game is linked here - there was one moment that still gives us chills.\n\nZoubek fouled out late and Miles Plumlee, who at that point was still pretty erratic, replaced him. Before Zoubek left the court, he had some ferocious words for his teammates on the court, and when he did leave the court, he put his finger in Plumlee\u2019s face and told him, in so many words, you finish it!\n\nPlumlee just bumped fists and nodded - then did his job and Duke won.\n\nIt was a superb leadership moment and foreshadowed Zoubek\u2019s absolutely critical contributions against Butler in the title game because without Zoubek, Duke couldn\u2019t have stopped the Bulldogs.", "description": "One of Brian Zoubek\u2019s very finest moments at Duke023", "authors": ["Jd King", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rI3e3Jj6L-EHo3PnyjnbIMwFZZo=/0x0:3336x1747/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18315676/112840719.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-17"}
