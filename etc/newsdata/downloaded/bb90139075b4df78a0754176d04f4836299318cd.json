Bernie Sanders as Putin?\n\nBiden also unexpectedly gestured at Bernie Sanders when referring to Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Bernie Sanders interupted, \u201cVladimir Putin, here?\u201d\n\n3. Which son?\n\nBiden defended his son Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but failed to differentiate him from his deceased son Beau Biden, who was the Attorney General of Delaware.\n\n\u201cEven when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything so that there would be no potential conflict,\u201d he said, without naming Beau.\n\n4. He chokes!\n\nTwitter users also flagged a moment when Biden choked on his spit or coughed during a response.\n\nI think Joe Biden is malfunctioning. pic.twitter.com/cDzpNNdOkO \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 16, 2019\n\n5. Ending Roe vs. Wade?\n\nBiden also stumbled when saying he was \u201cput in the position of ending Roe vs. Wade\u201d before correcting himself to talk about gun sales.\n\n6. Biden vague on the issue of being vague\n\nBiden criticized his Democrat rival Elizabeth Warren for being vague, but ended up sounding more vague in the process. \u201cPart of that requires you not being vague,\u201d Biden said. When asked to explain what he meant, he meandered on for several seconds talking about the different costs of healthcare.\n\n7. Age is wisdom\n\nWhen asked about his age, Biden said that his advanced age gave him \u201cwisdom\u201d to be president.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWith it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders.\u201d\n\nBiden struggled throughout the night to demonstrate that his advanced age made him more qualified to be president than any of the younger candidates.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden frequently became tongue-tied during the Democrat debate on Tuesday night, awkwardly phrasing his words.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Biden-Debate-Gaffes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
