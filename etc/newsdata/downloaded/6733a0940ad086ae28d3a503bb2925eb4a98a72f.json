(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nPresident Trump told some whoppers over the course of a 71-minute Cabinet meeting that turned into a live-streaming, rambling self-defense. (CNN counted 20 false claims.) Several of Trump's claims were distortions of his economic record \u2014 and probably will help form the spine of his reelection pitch in 2020.\n\nSo, some fact-checking is in order:\n\n1. On the rise of median household income.\n\nTrump opened the session by pointing to a jump in median household income he says far outstrips that of his two most recent predecessors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody saw, the household median income, for eight years of President Bush, it rose $800. For eight years of President Obama, it rose $975,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd for two and a half years of President Trump \u2014 they have it down as 2.5 years \u2014 it rose $5,000, not including $2,000 for taxes. So it rose let\u2019s say $7,000. So in two and a half years we\u2019re up $7,000, compared to $1,000, compared to $400. And that\u2019s for eight years and eight years. That\u2019s a number that just came out, but that\u2019s a number that I don\u2019t know how there can be any dispute. I\u2019ve never heard of a number like that. Meaning that the economy is doing fantastically well.\u201d (See the entire meeting here.)\n\nIt\u2019s true that in nominal terms, median household income is hitting new highs, topping $63,000 last year in a first, according to Census Bureau figures. But that mark comes with two important qualifications. First, after adjusting for inflation, the number has barely budged in the past 20 years. \u201cOn an inflation-adjusted basis, Americans families are earning just 2.7% more than they did in 1999, when median household income stood at $61,526, or 2007, when the median household income was about $61,000,\u201d per CBS News\u2019s Aimee Picchi.\n\nHere\u2019s the 20-year history in chart form:\n\nTrump's numbers appear to have originated in a pair of columns from the Heritage Foundation's Steve Moore, who used research from a private firm called Sentier Research, per PolitiFact's Louis Jacobson. He writes that \"median income has risen under Trump, and economists expect it to rise again in 2019 once those figures are available. But even taking the expected 2019 statistics into account, the increase under Trump in the official data ... should be smaller than the increase Sentier\u2019s data shows, while the increase under Obama \u2014 even factoring in the Great Recession he inherited \u2014 is bigger than Sentier\u2019s data shows.\"\n\nAnd the median number obscures an important fact about the distribution of the gains. Perhaps ironically, recent economic winners are concentrated in Democratic districts, where \u201ccollege degrees and professional jobs are plentiful \u2014 and the economy is thriving,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Aaron Zitner and Dante Chinni write. Republican districts, by contrast, \u201chold a growing share of jobs in low-skill manufacturing, agriculture and mining \u2014 sectors that often do not require college degrees and which offer lower pay. Median household income and GDP have fallen in these districts, compared to the House districts Republicans represented a decade ago.\u201d\n\n2. On the jobless rate for minorities and women.\n\nTrump accurately said unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics are at all-time lows. He said the same thing about Asian Americans, but their unemployment sits at 2.4 percent, tying a low it hit in 2006. Trump also said the unemployment rate for women is at a 71-year low; in fact, it\u2019s at a 66-year low:\n\nAnd it\u2019s worth noting these positive developments continue long-standing trends. Here, for example, is the recent history of the black jobless rate:\n\nBy the president\u2019s other preferred measure of economic well-being, median household income, African-American and Asian American households are actually worse off than at the end of the Obama administration. \"The median income last year for a black household was $40,258, according to the Census Bureau,\u201d AP\u2019s Calvin Woodwardand Hope Yen wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s below a 2000 peak of $42,348 and also statistically no better than 2016\u2026 As for Asian Americans, the median income for a typical household last year was $81,331. It was $83,182 in 2016.\u201d\n\n3. On \u201ctrillions\u201d in new value across the economy.\n\nTrump said the United States now has \u201ctremendous power because since the election of 2016, November, since that beautiful day, our country has picked up in value trillions and trillions of dollars of worth. Trillions and trillions of dollars. Numbers that nobody would believe. Numbers that if I would have said it on the campaign trail, I would have been excoriated by the fake media.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear what Trump is referring to here \u2014 but it\u2019s possible he means GDP, which gained $1.8 trillion from the end of 2017 through the middle of last year.\n\nBut Trump early in his presidency projected the economy would rev up as much as 6 percent. It has so far averaged in the mid-2 percent range and looks to be slowing as the boost from his tax cuts wane and the trade war weighs on businesses.\n\n4. On the stock market\u2019s performance.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible Trump was referring to the stock market\u2019s rise during his time in office. It\u2019s a subject he returned to later in the meeting. \u201cI have the strongest economy in the history of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re setting records\u2026 Over 100 times we've had the highest stock market in history since November 8. Over 100 times. And by the way, the day I got elected, the following day from there until January 20, the market went through the roof. You know why it went through the roof? Because they got rid of Obama and they got rid of Clinton.\u201d\n\nBut from Obama\u2019s inauguration until this point in his presidency, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 48.5 percent; under Trump, it has risen 35.5 percent.\n\n5. On China\u2019s growth struggles.\n\nThe president exaggerated by 30 years the interval since China has seen its economic growth slow as much as it has this year. \u201cChina is doing very poorly \u2014 worst year they've had in 57 years,\u201d Trump said. In fact, the country is seeing its weakest growth since 1992 \u2014 27 years.\n\n6. On who shoulders the burden for U.S. tariffs.\n\nTrump said China is paying the tariffs that his administration has imposed on imports from the country. \u201cWe\u2019re taking billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a claim he\u2019s made so often, it almost seems unworthy of a mention at this point. But it\u2019s just as wrong as the first time he said it. In fact, American businesses bringing in those goods and the American consumers buying them are paying the import taxes.\n\nThere were a number of other inaccuracies, too, from inflated statements about crowd sizes at his rallies to the false claims about the disposition of American troops in the Middle East and dismissing as \"phony\" the emoluments clause of the Constitution. But as Trump leans on the economy to boost his reelection bid, expect to hear some of these same distortions about his economic report card.\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

AP's Alex Veiga and Damian Troise: \"Technology companies and banks helped power stocks on Wall Street broadly higher Monday, extending the market\u2019s gains of the past two weeks.

Bloomberg's Hannah Levitt: \"More than half of the world\u2019s banks are too weak to survive a downturn, according to a survey from consultancy McKinsey & Co. A majority of banks globally may not be economically viable because their returns on equity aren\u2019t keeping pace with costs, McKinsey said in its annual review of the industry released Monday. It urged firms to take steps such as developing technology, farming out operations and bulking up through mergers ahead of a potential economic slowdown...\n\n\"In its report, the firm said banks risk 'becoming footnotes to history' as new entrants change consumer behavior. Most recent attempts by banks to boost efficiency have been 'business-as-usual,' it said.\"\n\n\u2014 A weakened Justin Trudeau holds on to power.
