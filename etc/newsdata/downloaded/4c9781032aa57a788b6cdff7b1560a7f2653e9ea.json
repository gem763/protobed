The company, which made its local debut last month at Automechanika Johannesburg, showcased its first model, the Prim8.\n\nMureza \u2013 which prides itself as a black-owned car manufacturing company that \u201cdesigns and manufactures cars in Africa for Africans\u201d \u2013 is the brainchild of Tatenda Mungofa (31), the CEO of the company.\n\nHe says that when he was seven years old he stumbled on a car magazine that sparked his interest in car design. \u201cThere were always sketches of concept vehicles on pages 5 to 7 which would showcase the \u2018future cars\u2019. As exciting as it was to see what the industry would produce, there were not any African concepts for many years,\u201d Mungofa said.\n\nDesigning cars for Africa became a mission that simply had to be done by Africans for Africans\n\nMungofa said this is what sparked his idea of designing cars for Africans.\n\n\u201cDesigning cars for Africa became a mission that simply had to be done by Africans for Africans. That is a passion which drives the entire team,\u201d Mungofa said.\n\nMungofa co-founded the company with Thulisa Sosibo and Pheladi Chiloane and registered it in South Africa in 2016.\n\nTogether they set out to manufacture cars that are focused on the daily transportation requirements for the African continent.\n\nTo do that, Mungofa said they looked for partnerships with companies that would help make their designs a reality.\n\n\u201cWe had to engage external support to bring the needed quality and expertise to ensure that our products would be competitive against the existing peers.\n\n\u201cThis is where the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme iranienne de production automobile [Saipa] comes in as a technical partner with vast experience of more than 50 years in the manufacturing of cars,\u201d Mungofa said.\n\nSaipa is an automaker headquartered in Tehran, Iran, which got its start in 1965 assembling Citro\u00ebns under licence for the Iranian market.\n\nMungofa said the partnership with Saipa would help Mureza to lower production costs and ultimately make the vehicles more affordable for the consumer.\n\nThe company\u2019s first offering, the Prim8 \u2013 pronounced primate \u2013 is based on a new platform that was developed by Saipa called the X200. Initially cars will be assembled at the Automotive Supplier Park in Rosslyn, Pretoria. The company is working on getting production set up at the Willowvale assembly plant in Zimbabwe and at the former Hyundai plant in Botswana.\n\nIt is competitively priced with the top of the range costing about R180 000 to R200 000. The pricing of the Prim8 pits against cars such as the Ford Figo and Peugeot 108.\n\nThose cars are smaller than the Prim8, making it more appealing.\n\nThe Prim8 features 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Bluetooth,\n\nsatellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto,\n\nsteering controls, adaptive cruise control, automatic transmission,\n\nkeyless entry and air conditioning.\n\nDifferent trim and spec levels in the interior will be available for customers and they can customise colours and materials at no extra cost if they pre-order the car.\n\n\n\nMungofa said safety was the priority.\n\n\u201cFour airbags come standard. Our vehicle has been benchmarked to international OEM [original equipment manufacturer] standards and is undergoing homologation for local standards certification. We are confident this will be scored above average against its segment competitor.\u201d\n\nThe company is hoping that the aggressive pricing will help to get people to look at the car but they are want people to \u201cexperience\u201d the Prim8.\n\nREAD: The future of cars is electric but SA is lagging behind\n\n\u201cThere are events which will be announced for the market to engage with the product,\u201d Mungofa said. The company will launch the Prim8 next month and production is expected to start early next year.\n\nThe company is working on introducing a half-ton bakkie, with production expected in the second quarter of 2020, as well as a mini SUV.", "description": "A new player in the African motoring industry, Mureza, is hoping to make it big in South Africa.
