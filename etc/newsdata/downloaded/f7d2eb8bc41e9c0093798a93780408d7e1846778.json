Soto\u2019s 3-for-4, three-RBI day led an unprecedented roasting of Cole, who allowed one run in 22\u2154 innings over three previous starts this October \u2014 and five in seven innings against the Soto-led Nats.\n\nThe World Series. Twenty-first birthday still a few days off. Gerrit Cole on the mound. The approach?\n\n\u201cI forget about everybody around,\u201d Soto said. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me.\u201d\n\nFor Washington, that\u2019s a watered-down version of Soto\u2019s remarkably advanced approach, which we\u2019ll get to. For Houston, he is the most significant problem in navigating the rest of this series, because if Cole can\u2019t get through Soto, who can?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dog that plays checkers,\u201d said Johnny DiPuglia, the Nationals\u2019 vice president of international operations.\n\nA what?\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see dogs playing checkers,\u201d DiPuglia said.\n\nAD\n\nNo, you don\u2019t. And you don\u2019t see Juan Sotos.\n\nSo what, exactly, do we have here? Statistically, the hitters through age 20 who most resemble Soto, according to baseball-reference.com, are the following: Tony Conigliaro, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Bryce Harper, Mike Trout and Ken Griffey Jr. Blink your eyes clear, read those names again, and smile about the future. General Manager Mike Rizzo pointed out he has brought four 19-year-olds to the big leagues over his career in Arizona and Washington \u2014 Justin Upton, Harper, Soto and Victor Robles.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou guys rank them,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cHe\u2019s up there.\u201d\n\nWhat Soto has is a rare combination in a 32-year-old with 5,000 major league plate appearances, let alone a 20-year-old who began last season with Hagerstown, the Nats\u2019 affiliate in the low Class A South Atlantic League. From a teenager riding the buses in the bushes to this absolute monster.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the top five players in all of baseball, really, for me,\u201d Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nNote: Roberts said that before Soto absolutely clobbered a pitch from Dodgers legend Clayton Kershaw to tie the fifth game of the division series in the eighth inning. Maybe that moved him into Roberts\u2019s top three?\n\nAD\n\nWhatever the ranking \u2014 let\u2019s discuss that in the offseason \u2014 there are obvious physical gifts that contribute to Soto\u2019s production. The strength needed \u2014 forearms, wrists, legs \u2014 to do what Soto did to Cole\u2019s fourth-inning fastball is obvious, raw and pure. The pitch, at 96 mph, was up and away, and Soto attacked it with a movement that\u2019s simultaneously violent and smooth.\n\nThe two-out double an inning later came after Cole worked him to a full count. This one was a slider, and there\u2019s the point that\u2019s problematic for the Astros going forward. If he can hit two of the best pitches in two different counts from the pitcher who has been the game\u2019s best for most of this season \u2014 to the opposite field, with power \u2014 then is there anything he can\u2019t hit?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHitting, and hitting off that guy, are two different things,\u201d Rizzo said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaybe he thinks he\u2019s better than the guy who\u2019s the best in the world,\u201d DiPuglia said.\n\nJuan Soto makes it 2-2 with a home run that traveled [checks notes] many, many feet. pic.twitter.com/d95L8S7BLQ\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf9: @mlb \u2014 Post Sports (@PostSports) October 23, 2019\n\nSo to get to the level Soto has reached at this age \u2014 with just 1,665 professional plate appearances, not counting the postseason \u2014 it can\u2019t just be physical. And it\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cHe understands the game at a really high level,\u201d said Max Scherzer, who earned a win in Game 1. \u201cHas a very good baseball IQ and has a really, really good hitter\u2019s IQ.\u201d\n\nThis is manifesting itself in the postseason, as Soto works counts and takes pitches with his special, I-see-what-you\u2019re-doing-to-me shuffle in the batter\u2019s box on baseball\u2019s biggest stage. But it also showed up on the back fields at the Nationals\u2019 West Palm Beach, Fla., spring training complex, before anyone knew who Juan Soto was.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDave Martinez, his manager, likes to tell the story about the first time he saw Soto \u2014 spring training last year. First at-bat, he badly missed a slider in the dirt, typical for a 19-year-old facing big league pitching, just flailing. But Soto followed by stepping out of the box, shaking his head a bit, resetting, stepping back in, getting the exact same pitch \u2014 and taking it. There\u2019s maturity in that moment.\n\n\u201cNext pitch, same pitch, got it up a little bit,\u201d Martinez said, \u201cand he hit a rocket off the left-center field wall.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a preternatural ability to learn and adjust from pitch to pitch, and he has carried that to the majors. Take Tuesday night. In the first, Cole blew him away with three fastballs, all up in the zone. Think he didn\u2019t take that info \u2014 and that feeling \u2014 into his next at-bat? DiPuglia said it\u2019s not uncommon for Soto to talk about the spin rate of a curveball or the tilt on a slider or whether a fastball has run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s prepared, man,\u201d DiPuglia said. \u201cThe kid\u2019s prepared better than any young player I\u2019ve ever seen. It comes from being smart. It comes from loving the game. It comes from knowing the history of the game. And it comes from being prepared and asking the right questions.\u201d\n\nNow he is up against an Astros organization that considers itself the smartest in baseball. Can it figure out a way to pitch to him? The truth is, he hasn\u2019t been the best version of himself this postseason. Before Tuesday, he was hitting just .237 (9 for 38) with only four walks in 10 games.\n\nBut in the midst of all that were moments that show he can deliver, even through struggles. Think of those, to this point: the rip of a single that beat Milwaukee in the wild-card game. The bomb against Kershaw that set up Howie Kendrick\u2019s NLDS-winning grand slam. And now, Tuesday night, in the Nationals\u2019 first World Series game \u2014 three RBI, a homer, a double and, for good measure, a stolen base. The last time a player had three hits, a homer and a stolen base in a World Series game: 1997, a year before Soto was born.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNothing seems to bother him,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nIncluding a pitcher he had never seen before. In the eighth, the Astros brought in reliever Will Harris. There is no lefty in the Houston bullpen, no weapon to neutralize Soto.\n\nHarris got Soto to look at a curveball for strike one, then got him to foul off a fastball for strike two.\n\nHis response? Shake his head, get back in the box and rifle an 0-2 curveball into center for a single.\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at here: a generational talent on baseball\u2019s grandest stage. Revel in it, Washington \u2014 in the World Series, and in the homegrown stud who is in the process of altering it.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Gerrit Cole and the Astros found out the hard way just how good the Nationals\u2019 young slugger really is in Game 1 of the World Series.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KNrUYxYppTILQXpExDV8cioRlyE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QYCJECHVGYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
