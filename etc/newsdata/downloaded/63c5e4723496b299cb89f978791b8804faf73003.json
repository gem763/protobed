The agreement is designed to facilitate investigations related to terrorism, child abuse and exploitation, and other serious crimes.\n\nZuckerberg: I'll 'go to the mat and fight' Warren over plan to break up Facebook Read more\n\nPrior to the agreement, requests for data from foreign technology companies were submitted to governments and frequently took between six months to two years. The new bilateral agreement is expected to speed this process significantly, to weeks or even days.\n\nThe draft open letter was first reported by BuzzFeed News. The governments\u2019 request will reignite a longstanding debate over how to balance privacy with public safety.\n\nZuckerberg defended his decision to encrypt the company\u2019s messaging services despite concerns about its impact on child exploitation and other criminal activity.\n\nZuckerberg, speaking Thursday in a livestreamed version of the company\u2019s weekly internal Q&A session, said child exploitation risks weighed \u201cmost heavily\u201d on him when he was making the decision and pledged steps to minimize harm.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cWe strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.\u201d\n\nWhat are Facebook\u2019s planned changes?\n\nFacebook\u2019s messaging app WhatsApp already employs end-to-end encryption, shielding the content of its 1.5bn users\u2019 messages from the company itself. In March 2019, Zuckerberg announced plans to integrate Facebook\u2019s other messaging apps, Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with WhatsApp and incorporate end-to-end encryption across the entire service. Facebook\u2019s move to expand the use of encryption followed a year in which the company came under global criticism for its failure to protect the data of its users, and it was branded as a pivot toward a \u201cprivacy-focused communications platform\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook has announced end-to-end encryption for all its messaging apps. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nBut law enforcement agencies have long looked askance at encrypted communications, which they argue protect criminals and terrorists while stymying investigators.\n\n\u201cSecurity enhancements to the virtual world should not make us more vulnerable in the physical world,\u201d the open letter reads. \u201cWe must find a way to balance the need to secure data with public safety and the need for law enforcement to access the information they need to safeguard the public, investigate crimes, and prevent future criminal activity. Not doing so hinders our law enforcement agencies\u2019 ability to stop criminals and abusers in their tracks.\u201d\n\nThe letter specifically focuses on the threat of child sexual exploitation and abuse, noting that Facebook\u2019s combination of encrypted messaging and open profiles could provide \u201cunique routes for prospective offenders to identify and groom our children\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports to the US National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) \u2013 more than 90% of the 18.4 million total reports that year,\u201d the letter states. \u201cNCMEC estimates that 70% of Facebook\u2019s reporting \u2013 12 million reports globally \u2013 would be lost [if Facebook implements encryption as planned].\u201d\n\nPrivacy v public safety\n\nThe letter asserts that the governments \u201csupport strong encryption\u201d while also demanding \u201ca means for lawful access to the content of communications\u201d \u2013 an apparent reference to a so-called \u201cbackdoor\u201d into the encrypted communications.\n\nGovernments have often proposed such backdoors as a compromise measure, but security experts argue that it is impossible to provide limited access to encrypted communication without weakening privacy overall.\n\n\u201cWe believe people have the right to have a private conversation online, wherever they are in the world,\u201d the Facebook spokesperson said. \u201cAhead of our plans to bring more security and privacy to our messaging apps, we are consulting closely with child safety experts, governments and technology companies and devoting new teams and sophisticated technology so we can use all the information available to us to help keep people safe.\u201d\n\nThe debate over encryption last flared up in 2016, when the FBI attempted to force Apple to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the killers in the San Bernardino, California, mass shooting. Advocates for civil liberties rallied around Apple against the US government, but the standoff fizzled out when the FBI broke into the phone by other means.\n\nA rash of lynchings fueled by misinformation in India provided an illustration of one of the downsides of encrypted mass communications in 2018, as neither the government nor Facebook nor civil society groups were able to monitor the spread of the false rumors fueling violent mobs.\n\nBut privacy advocates pushed back on the idea that a government backdoor was needed to keep people safe.\n\n\u201cWhen a door opens for the United States, Australia, or Britain, it also opens for North Korea, Iran, and hackers that want to steal our information,\u201d said Neema Singh Guliani, the senior legislative counsel for the ACLU. \u201cCompanies should resist these repeated attempts to weaken encryption that reliably protects consumers\u2019 sensitive data from identity thieves, credit card fraud, and human rights abusers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe UK, United States, and Australian authorities are once again falling into a false dichotomy between security and encryption,\u201d said Guillermo Beltra, the policy director of the digital rights organization Access Now. \u201cThe reality is that encryption is an essential technology that strengthens the security of the internet\u2019s infrastructure and enables users to enjoy their civil and political rights and express themselves freely.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower Edward Snowden criticized the governments\u2019 request on Twitter, saying: \u201cIf Facebook agrees, it may be the largest overnight violation of privacy in history.\u201d\n\nStephanie Kirchgaessner contributed reporting", "description": "Facebook says it opposes calls for backdoors that would \u2018undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere\u2019", "authors": ["Julia Carrie Wong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f9426c3ed6e564ba93857381153cbea83ffedb/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=044866e7df6df9c610f4baa5c5e43773", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
