As such, the cryptocurrency is now trading 3% down on the day. While this wasn\u2019t a decisively bearish move in and of itself, a sentiment that \u201cthe rally is over\u201d is starting to bubble in trading circles.\n\nBearish Bitcoin Analyses Rack Up\n\nThis move comes as bearish Bitcoin analyses have begun to reappear on Twitter, despite the historical 42% move that the leading cryptocurrency saw on the weekend.\n\nAs reported by NewsBTC previously, analyst Velvet noted that Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge upward hasn\u2019t convinced him that a crypto market rally to fresh all-time highs isn\u2019t inbound. They argued that their analysis indicates Bitcoin may be trading in a textbook bearish pattern defined by prominent historical technician Richard Wyckoff.\n\nAs Velvet pointed out, the recent rally, according to Wyckoff\u2019s studies, might just be a \u201cthrowback\u201d to a bull trend before an eventual breakdown, defined as a \u201cmarkdown\u201d by the analyst.\n\n$BTC #BTC #BTCUSD I'm not convinced with this weekly close guys, I'm sorry for not being bullish like everyone else. I guess somebody has to be the bear right? or at least have a Conservative approach Here is something to keep in mind among all the bullish and hopium charts \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/pNWo6PIO9Y \u2014 \ud835\udce5\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcf5\ud835\udcff\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcfd \ud83d\udcca \u4e1d\u7ed2 (@888Velvet) October 28, 2019\n\nTheir analysis indicates that the target of the downside move could be closer to where Bitcoin broke out of its accumulation range, near $5,800.\n\nVelvet isn\u2019t the only one spouting bearish analysis. Crypto Walker argued that BTC is still trending in descending channel, having been rejected in a high-volume move at resistance. He added that with the \u201cdeath cross\u201d still formed and there having been a large \u201cdrop in open interest,\u201d he remains bearish.\n\n$BTC daily The descending channel is still intact. High volume rejection at resistance. Price dumped below 100MA again. Death cross 50/200MA. Huge drop in open interest during the recent pump. I remain bearish for now but open to switch bias if I see a bullish consolidation. pic.twitter.com/355fNPOjF0 \u2014 Crypto Walker \ud83d\udd30 (@cryptoWalk3r) October 28, 2019\n\nBullish Above $8,000\n\nAlthough there is a growing level of sentiment hinting at an impending correction for Bitcoin, popular macro and crypto analyst Alex Kr\u00fcger has kept it simple. In a recent tweet, he remarked that Bitcoin\u2019s chart remains bullish as long as the cryptocurrency remains above the $8,000 to $8,200 region \u2014 some 15% lower than the current price point of $9,300.\n\nHe remarked in an earlier tweet that a loss of the abovementioned region will render the recent Bitcoin bull move \u201cdead,\u201d and thus lead to a continuation \u201clower,\u201d presumably below the multi-month low of $7,300 established late last week.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Over the past 30 minutes, Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged by $300 from $9,515 to $9,200.
