He said members of the House of Commons should \u201ccome together as democrats to end this debilitating feud\u201d that has wracked the country for more than three years.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for this great House of Commons to come together\u2026 as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting,\u201d Johnson told lawmakers.\n\nBut he may not get the vote he craves. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would first allow a vote on an amendment that essentially puts the vote on the deal off until another day. Those behind the amendment say it will remove the risk that the U.K. could stumble out of the bloc without a deal on Oct. 31 because the law is not in place.\n\nIf the amendment passes, it also will force Johnson to seek a delay from the EU to Britain\u2019s departure, due to take place in less than two weeks on Oct. 31.\n\nThe prime minister signaled that he would do that under duress. He is compelled by law to ask for the extension, but he said \u201cit cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d\n\nSince striking a deal with the EU on Thursday, Johnson has been imploring and arm-twisting both Conservative and opposition lawmakers as he tries to win majority support for his deal.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative Party holds only 288 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, so he will have to rely on support from other parties and independent lawmakers to get over the line.\n\nThe result looks set to be close, although Johnson has had some success winning over both hard-core Conservative Brexiteers and a handful of opposition Labour lawmakers who represent pro-Brexit parts of the country.\n\nJohnson hopes for success in getting a fractious Parliament to back the deal after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get lawmakers behind her plan.\n\nHe said in The Sun newspaper on Saturday that a vote for the plan would bring a \u201cpainful chapter in our history\u201d to an end.\n\nAs lawmakers gathered inside Parliament \u2014 their first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Falklands War \u2014 tens of thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators were expected to march on the building, calling for a new referendum on whether to leave the EU or remain.\n\nMany lawmakers want to rule out the possibility that Britain could crash out of the bloc without a deal on the Oct. 31 deadline \u2014 a prospect economists say would disrupt trade and plunge the economy into recession. The amendment to be voted on Saturday would withhold approval of the deal until all the necessary legislation to implement it has passed.\n\nOne of the lawmakers behind the measure, Oliver Letwin, said it would prevent the U.K. from leaving at the end of the month \u201cby mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation.\u201d\n\nIf that amendment passes, Johnson will have to ask the EU for a delay to Britain\u2019s departure date. Last month Parliament passed a law compelling the government to do that if no deal is approved by Saturday.\n\nIt would also give another chance to scrutinize \u2014 and possibly change\u2014 the departure terms while the legislation is passing through Parliament.\n\nJohnson\u2019s hopes of getting the deal through Parliament were dealt a blow when his Northern Ireland ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, said it would not back him. The party says Johnson\u2019s Brexit package \u2014 which carves out special status for Northern Ireland to keep an open border with EU member Ireland \u2014 is bad for the region and its bonds with the rest of the U.K.\n\n\u201cWe will not be supporting the government, we will be voting against,\u201d said the party\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds. \u201cBecause it isn\u2019t Brexit for the whole of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nTo make up for the votes of 10 DUP lawmakers, Johnson has tried to persuade members of the left-of-center Labour Party to support the deal. Late Friday the government promised to bolster protections for the environment and workers\u2019 rights, to allay Labour fears that the Conservative government plans to slash those protections after Brexit.\n\nSenior figures in the party were unimpressed.\n\n\u201cThis empty gesture is not worth the paper it\u2019s written on,\u201d said Labour employment spokeswoman Laura Pidcock.\n\n___\n\nMike Corder contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to get Parliament to approve his divorce deal with the European Union was thrown into doubt Saturday, as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/3db439_britain-brexit-15039-british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-leaves-10-downing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
