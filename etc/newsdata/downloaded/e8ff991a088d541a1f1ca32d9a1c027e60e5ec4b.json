REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman\n\nThe event gives Modi, a nationalist facing international criticism over a recent crackdown in disputed Kashmir, a chance to energize his relationship with Indian-Americans who are active political supporters. Trump, meanwhile, will face a largely foreign-born audience that may not prove receptive to his typical strident anti-immigrant messages.\n\nJubilant supporters dressed in everything from ornate saris to simple dhotis and even a few cowboy hats waved American and Indian flags, chanted \u201cModi! Modi!\u201d and munched on concession stand snacks that included Indian staples of samosas and naan breads - along with nachos.\n\n\u201cToday we celebrate our community and its importance in Houston and all America,\u201d said Ketan Inamdar, who works in the administration of Houston\u2019s Democratic Mayor Sylvester Turner, and painted an American flag on his right cheek and an Indian one on the left.\n\n\u201cTrump is very welcome here today. This event is to build harmony and love,\u201d he said, standing just in front of the dais where Trump and Modi would speak. \u201cRace, religion and political parties don\u2019t matter today.\u201d\n\nHouston is a rare Democratic stronghold in Republican-dominated Texas and serves as the economic anchor of a state that will be critical to Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election bid. Polls show tepid support by Indian-American voters, some 75% of whom voted for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in 2016.\n\nBut organizers of the \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d event that was kicked off with a 90-minute cultural program featuring 400 costumed dancers, say Trump can expect a receptive audience.\n\n\u201cHis presence is an indication of his support and endorsement of the strengthening of India\u2019s relations with America,\u201d said Preeti Dawra, a spokeswoman for the Texas India Forum that organized the event. \u201cThis event is about strengthening those ties.\u201d\n\nIt will not be the first time Modi, who heads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, has addressed a large crowd in the United States, which is home to about 4 million Indian-Americans including about 300,000 in Houston and nearby Dallas, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census data.\n\nSome 19,000 people turned out for a similar event in New York in 2014, and Indian-American volunteers living in U.S. suburbs helped run a telephone blitz of voters in India in the run-up to his May re-election campaign.\n\nKASHMIR CRACKDOWN\n\nModi\u2019s visit to Houston comes ahead of this week\u2019s U.N. General Assembly in New York and amid a particularly tense time on the subcontinent.\n\nThe Indian leader further strained long-simmering relations with Pakistan last month by revoking the partial autonomy enjoyed by Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed countries claim. Modi\u2019s move has been met by international criticism.\n\nPakistan has condemned the crackdown and its Prime Minister Imran Khan warned it would drive more of the world\u2019s Muslims into extremism.\n\nMembers of India\u2019s religious minority Sikh and Muslim groups are planning noisy gatherings near the stadium to protest Modi\u2019s Kashmir policy.\n\nThe U.S.-India relationship on trade and tariffs is rocky, though Trump and Modi appear to have strong personal ties.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nBut Devesh Kapur, director of Asia Programs at Johns Hopkins University, who has written a book on Indian-Americans, said that while the rally has symbolic value for both leaders, \u201cit\u2019s unlikely by itself to impact thorny trade issues ... but it can\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nKapur also forecast little improvement regarding Trump\u2019s standing with Indian-Americans.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s hard-line policies on immigration ... have hardly endeared (him) to the community,\u201d Kapur said. \u201cAppearing with PM Modi might mildly help but certainly not reverse the community\u2019s overall pro-Democrat leanings.\u201d", "description": "Tens of thousands of Indian-Americans packed into a Houston stadium Sunday for a rally with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, joined by U.S. President Donald Trump, in a rare mass show of support for a foreign leader on U.S. soil.", "authors": ["Brad Brooks", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432635612&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0G0", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
