Legislation of this type would normally take months but the Houses of Commons and Lords would have less than two weeks.\n\n'No-deal' Brexit? .\n\nThe default legal position is that Britain leaves the EU on October 31 unless it asks to delay, and the other 27 member states agree.\n\nBusiness and markets across Europe fear the shock of a sudden Brexit that even the government's own assessment says would cause economic damage.\n\nAfter signing off on the Brexit deal this week at a summit in Brussels, EU leaders warned they did not want to see Brexit delayed again.\n\nBut confronted with a formal request -- and the threat of a possible no-deal departure -- they would be expected to agree.\n\nAnother election?\n\nJohnson has already tried twice to get an early general election, to allow him to win back a majority in parliament.\n\nBut he needs the support of the main opposition Labour party to call one.\n\nLabour says it will back an election when the threat of a \"no deal\" Brexit is off the table.\n\nA second referendum?\n\nLabour says any deal should be subject to a new referendum, and has promised to call one if it takes office.\n\nSome MPs may try to force the issue during the passage of the Brexit deal legislation, although it is far from clear that they have the numbers to succeed.", "description": "British MPs have again ruptured the Brexit process by withholding their support for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new divorce deal with the European Union.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9437/f840a245661f4c15b7bf1fa7a152e5cd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
