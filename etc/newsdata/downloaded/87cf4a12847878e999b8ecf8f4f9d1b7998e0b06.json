Fitch has rated HMEL's senior unsecured debt one notch below its Issuer Default Rating (IDR), at the same level as the other existing senior unsecured bonds (due 2027), due to the high proportion of secured debt in its capital structure. The majority of the notes' proceeds will be used to refinance HMEL's secured borrowings, which should reduce the proportion of secured debt. However, the ratio of secured debt/EBITDA would remain above 3x, which is well above Fitch's threshold of 2.0 to 2.5x for material subordination of unsecured debt, resulting in the one-notch lower rating than its IDR. The final rating on the notes follows the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received and is the same as the expected rating assigned on 4 October 2019. HMEL's IDR is assessed under a bottom-up approach based on Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria that would have resulted in a two-notch uplift from its Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) of 'bb-'. However, we have capped HMEL's IDR at the 'bb' SCP of its 48.99% parent, Hindustan Petroleum (NS: ) Corporation Limited (HPCL, BBB-/Stable), as we do not believe that HPCL's parent, Oil and Natural Gas (NS: ) Corporation Limited, nor the Indian government (BBB-/Stable), would ultimately provide support to HMEL. This limits the current uplift to one notch. HMEL's SCP reflects robust refining operations from its high-complexity refinery, strong demand, healthy profitability and elevated leverage. Key Rating Drivers Weak GRM, High Capex: HMEL's gross refining margin (GRM) fell to USD12.2 a barrel in the financial year ended March 2019 (FY19), 9% lower than our estimates, though still significantly outperforming Singapore GRMs, which are used as the regional benchmark. Capex for HMEL's petrochemical project was brought forward in FY19 and therefore was 16% higher than our estimates. These two factors led to a rise in HMEL's net leverage, measured by net adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR, to 5.5x in FY19, from 5.2x in FY18.\n\nLower Leverage Headroom: Net leverage is likely to stay above 5.0x over the next three years due to HMEL's large capex plans, despite strong operating cash flow. HMEL is setting up a petrochemical plant with 1.2 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) capacity to improve downstream integration. It spent INR67 billion of total estimated capex of INR228 billion by FYE19, with the balance to be spent over the next four years. Leverage should peak at above 6.0x in FY21 on lower throughput due to a planned shutdown for major maintenance then fall once the petrochemical project starts operations in FY23. We believe HMEL is taking steps to optimise liquidity and working-capital requirements through extended payment terms with major crude suppliers during the high capex phase. We will monitor progress on capex and profitability, as deviation may pressure the SCP. Strong Refining Operations: HMEL's strong asset quality is driven by its high-complexity refinery, which has a Nelson complexity index of 12.6, one of the highest in India. This allows for the processing of heavy and optimisation of the company's product slate, which is reflected in HMEL's high GRM against regional benchmarks. We expect HMEL's GRM to rise moderately over the medium term, benefitting from stronger diesel cracks due to International Maritime Organization specification changes to limit sulphur content in all marine fuels from 2020. This should drive up prices and margins for compliant fuels, such as marine gasoil, at least in the medium term, and will benefit complex refiners that have the capacity to produce them, such as HMEL, which has a high middle distillate yield (FY19: 49%). This is likely to be partly offset by lower heavy-crude supply from Iran and Venezuela and additional refinery capacity coming on stream. Strategic Location with Strong Demand: HMEL's refinery utilisation rate benefits from favourable refining demand/supply for petroleum products in north India, where the company is located. The strategic location also limits competition. Fitch expects HMEL to maintain strong utilisation rates, supported by an offtake agreement with HPCL for its liquid hydrocarbon, which minimises offtake risk, and strong domestic demand for petroleum products. HMEL's throughput is likely to remain well above 100% in FY20, similar to the 110% level achieved in FY19. Cyclical Industry, Limited Integration: HMEL is exposed to the volatility of the international refining cycle, reflected in the recent dip in industrywide margins due to oversupply. However, HMEL should be less affected than peers due to its strategically located high-complexity refinery. The refinery has limited downstream integration from its small petrochemical capacity, but the planned expansion project should improve HMEL's integration and business profile over the medium term. Uplift from Linkages with HPCL: HMEL's rating benefits from its strategic and operational linkages with HPCL, which provides one notch of support from its SCP, as HMEL's IDR is capped at HPCL's SCP of 'bb'. HPCL's off-take agreement with HMEL to buy all liquid products, except naphtha, is valid until 2026 - with an option to extend it for two more terms of five years each - and constituted around 90% of HMEL's FY19 output by value. HMEL represents over 26% of HPCL's refining capacity following its refinery expansion and is accorded first priority by HPCL for sourcing its product requirements in north India, where HMEL is the parent's only refinery. Bond Rating Notched Down: Fitch has rated HMEL's senior unsecured bond one notch below its IDR, at same level as its other USD375 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027, due to the high proportion of secured debt in its capital structure. The majority of the proceeds of the notes will be used to refinance HMEL's secured borrowings, which will reduce the proportion of secured debt to 71% by FYE20 from 73% at FYE19. However, we expect secured debt/EBITDA to stay above 3x over the medium term as borrowing for its petrochemical expansion is likely to be mostly on a secured basis. As a result, the bonds are rated one notch lower than HMEL's IDR. Derivation Summary HMEL's IDR includes a one-notch uplift for its moderate linkages with HPCL. Its rating would benefit from one additional notch of uplift if its SCP weakened or if HPCL's SCP improved, provided linkages remained intact. HPCL is India's third-largest fuel-marketing company, with about one-fifth market share and the second-largest number of retail fuel outlets. HPCL's refining capacity of 27 MMTPA, including all of HMEL's 11.3 MMTPA capacity, accounts for more than 10% of India's refining capacity. The company is also the market leader in lubricant sales. HPCL's larger scale, integration into fuel retailing, average asset quality and better financial profile result in its SCP being one notch higher than that of HMEL. HMEL's SCP reflects strong refining asset quality, which is likely to drive stable cash flow. However, we also expect high leverage in light of elevated capex. HMEL's SCP is one notch higher than that of Sweden-based Corral Petroleum Holdings AB (CPH, B+/Stable) due to HMEL's better asset quality, stronger profitability and presence in the strongly expanding Indian market. CPH has larger scale and some integration into fuel retailing, but its presence in the mature European market, with expected excess refining capacity, structural decline in fuel consumption, as well as high competition, despite manageable capex and lower leverage, constrains its ratings. Key Assumptions Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer - Moderate increase in GRM from a wider diesel spreads, somewhat counterbalanced by higher refining capacity and lower heavy-crude supply - Long-term crude oil prices ( ) of USD57.5 a barrel (FY19: USD69.9) - Refinery throughput of 12.1 MMTPA in FY20, 10.8 in FY21 and 12.3 in FY22 (FY19: 12.5) - Capex of INR35 billion in FY20, INR58 billion in FY21 and INR40 billion in FY22 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Improvement in HPCL's SCP, provided linkages remain intact We do not expect positive action on HMEL's SCP over the medium term in light of our expectations of increasing leverage on account of large capex Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Significant weakening of linkages between HPCL and HMEL - Failure to lower net leverage, measured by net adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR, towards 5x or lower by FYE23, might result in a lowering of the SCP. However, HMEL's IDR will remain unchanged if its SCP falls by one notch due to an additional notch of support from its linkage with HPCL, provided the linkages remain intact. Liquidity and Debt Structure Comfortable Liquidity: HMEL's liquidity is comfortable, with a cash balance of around INR3.3 billion and undrawn sanctioned working-capital facilities of INR70.1 billion at FYE19, compared with long-term debt maturities of INR25.4 billion. In addition, HMEL has adequate access to the domestic debt market, where it has strong relationships with Indian banks, and the offshore market, where it raised USD375 million via a bond issue in April 2017, in addition to the latest USD300 million bond.
