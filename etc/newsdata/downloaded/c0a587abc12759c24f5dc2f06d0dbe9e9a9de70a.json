Sir James Eadie QC, for the prime minister, had argued it was a purely political decision that should not be subject to challenge in the courts.\n\nEarlier this week, a Scottish court turned down a similar legal challenge. A third claim seeking to overturn the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament until 14 October was being heard in Belfast on Friday.\n\nAll three claims are likely to go to appeal and will be combined for a joint hearing expected at the supreme court for three days starting on 17 September.\n\nProrogation has never lasted longer than three weeks in the past 40 years and in most cases was only for a week or less, the London court was told.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, Lord Pannick QC, representing Miller, described the prime minister\u2019s decision as an \u201cunlawful abuse of power\u201d.\n\nSpeaking afterwards outside the Royal Courts of Justice, Miller said she was disappointed at the decision but would fight on.\n\n\u201cWe are very disappointed with the judgment today. We feel strongly that parliamentary sovereignty is fundamental to the stability and future of our country and is therefore worth fighting to defend. As our politics becomes more chaotic on a daily basis, the more vital it is that parliament is sitting. We are therefore pleased that the judges have given permission to appeal to the supreme court on the grounds that our case has merit.\n\n\u201cAll of us here today, my legal team who have worked tirelessly over the last few weeks and I, feel we have no other option but to appeal this judgment to the supreme court. An appeal \u2018leapfrog\u2019 date has been set for 17 September.\n\n\u201cToday we stood up for everyone \u2013 we stood up for future generations, we stood up for our representative democracy, and tried to stop those who would wreck our constitution.\n\n\u201cTo give up now would be a dereliction of our responsibility to help protect our elected representatives \u2013 our eyes and ears that sit in Westminster \u2013 who protect our rights and give each of us a voice.\n\n\u201cIt is not right that they should be bullied or shut down \u2013 especially at this most momentous of times in the history of our United Kingdom. My legal team and I will not give up the fight for democracy.\u201d\n\nIn Belfast, lawyers for the victims\u2019 campaigner Raymond McCord told the high court that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would create chaos for Northern Ireland.\n\nRonan Lavery QC, appearing for McCord, praised the EU for its role in underpinning the peace process. \u201cTo leave without a withdrawal agreement would create chaos and economic misery and a real threat to the peace process in Northern Ireland \u2013 it would be madness.\u201d\n\nMcCord\u2019s son, also called Raymond, was murdered by loyalists from the Ulster Volunteer Force in North Belfast in 1997. He has repeatedly voiced concerns about the impact of Brexit on the peace process.\n\nAll-island co-operation deepened following the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which largely ended the conflict. Campaigners fear the creation of a hard Irish border after a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit would provide an opportunity for dissident republicans to reignite paramilitary violence.\n\n\u201cOur very simple proposition is that, when you take this piece of legislation, nothing sanctioned or authorised the executive [government] to take the drastic step of leaving the EU without a deal,\u201d Lavery said.\n\n\u201cThe court can intervene when the prime minister seeks to act in a way which is oppressive to the people of Northern Ireland contrary to their constitutional position.\u201d\n\nThe hearing continues.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Judge says PM acted lawfully in advice he gave to Queen to suspend parliament", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da7d28d103b64a1e0d046c9f5b0905ebf34ed638/0_158_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=771d3e247e66d2171535fb56ead001d9", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
