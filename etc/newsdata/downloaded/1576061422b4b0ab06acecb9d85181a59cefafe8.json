And people would flock from the village to watch him polish his monocle and abandon his children to a nanny, and in a fitting gesture to the times he belongs in, for an extra pound you could poke him with a stick.\n\nBut we\u2019re so used to assuming that if someone\u2019s posh they must be clever, we let him crash the country to pieces instead.\n\nSimilarly we have a prime minister regarded as a classic wit, and he gave a fine example when he responded to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s mention of chlorinated chicken with the line: \u201cThe only chlorinated chicken I see is you.\u201d What\u2019s so marvellous about this quip is it works on so many different intellectual levels.\n\nThis must be why the fees are so expensive at Eton, you don\u2019t get wit like that on the cheap. Maybe they practise hilarious insults at Eton, at a special course. They fetch in a peasant and make them shout words, then the student has to respond with an instant eloquent retort. If they shout \u201ckettle\u201d, and the boy quickly answers \u201cah, indeed it is YOU who are a kettle\u201d, they get extra marks and they\u2019re allowed to dip their genitals in custard.\n\nBut soon they\u2019ll have to be elected by the whole population if they want to carry on. So it\u2019s lucky they\u2019ve suddenly discovered they have a sum of money, to spend on things that for the last nine years they\u2019ve insisted we didn\u2019t have any money for.\n\nSajid Javid announced the necessity for austerity to come to an end this week, so it\u2019s alright to pay for schools and a police force now. Because it\u2019s not like the time Labour ruined the economy by paying for things, which was reckless as it was during an economic boom.\n\nThis is the proper time to boost spending, when everything\u2019s calm and predictable, and the government\u2019s own report tells us if the Brexiteers get their way and we leave Europe with no deal, we\u2019ll run out of food and medicine, and money will be so worthless if you have a \u00a310 note you might as well shove it up your arse to see if it\u2019s a cure for scurvy.\n\nIf you were a cynic you might wonder if the Conservatives realise Labour\u2019s promise to spend money on services we need, rather than on tax cuts for friends and family of the prime minister, could be popular. So they\u2019ve decided to copy the opposition. Or maybe they\u2019ve picked up Labour\u2019s policies by mistake, and tomorrow Iain Duncan Smith will announce: \u201cWhen it comes to defence, let me give this promise to the British people. Freedom for the oppressed people of Palestine. Gaza will be free. Vote Conservative.\u201d\n\nSo amid the confusion, a few issues remain certain for the forthcoming election. The media will be as reliable as ever, as we can see from the coverage of Boris Johnson\u2019s new puppy, which clearly wasn\u2019t in any way a public relations stunt orchestrated by the government, but simply a charming story, and the dog\u2019s arrival was another coincidence.\n\nNext week they\u2019ll tell us President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has a cute tortoise, which he always feeds after gassing a village. It\u2019s simply adorable.\n\nNo one can claim they haven\u2019t been warned as to who these people are. This is a feudal dynasty that has to be voted in by its subjects.\n\nIf it was honest it would say: \u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of talentless privileged sociopathic incoherent sadists who, without an outrageous sense of entitlement and staggering advantages granted by birthright, would be incapable of the simplest tasks such as stroking a cat or looking at a tomato.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe despise all of you born into what we consider lesser bloodlines, which is all of you, up to and including the Queen. We would happily destroy you and not lose a minute\u2019s sleep. Vote Conservative.\u201d\n\nIf it wins, we will be the equivalent of African nations voting to be recolonised and for the resumption of the slave trade. Or like those Thai football kids voting to be returned to their terrifying cave, as the daylight was making them sneeze.\n\nSurely we\u2019re not that bloody daft.", "description": "It\u2019s a sign of what a fun country we are, that not only can we create Jacob Rees-Mogg, but we allow him to become a senior member of the government.
