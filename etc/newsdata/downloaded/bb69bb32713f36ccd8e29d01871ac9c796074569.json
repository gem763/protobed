The gravitational flux will go through the wormhole,\u2019 said Dejan Stojkovic, PhD, cosmologist and professor of physics in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\u2018So if you map the expected orbit of a star around Sagittarius A*, you should see deviations from that orbit if there is a wormhole there with a star on the other side.\u2019\n\nHowever, even if we find a wormhole there\u2019s no guarantee we could simply jump into it and speed through into an alien universe.\n\n\u2018Even if a wormhole is traversable, people and spaceships most likely aren\u2019t going to be passing through,\u2019 Stojkovic added.\n\n\u2018Realistically, you would need a source of negative energy to keep the wormhole open, and we don\u2019t know how to do that. To create a huge wormhole that\u2019s stable, you need some magic.\u2019", "description": "Dark beast at the centre of our galaxy may be accompanied by 'wormholes' leading to alternate realities.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89815461_1572279872.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
