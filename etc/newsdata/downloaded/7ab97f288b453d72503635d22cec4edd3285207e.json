He is in a stable condition in hospital, the South China Morning Post reports.\n\nA second man was allegedly beaten by protesters who found a baton in his bag and believed he was an undercover police officer.\n\nEmbedding police among the protesters has paid tactical dividends for the Hong Kong force, and spread paranoia among the mostly young activists.\n\nOvernight on Sunday, one group of protesters hauled a three-metre-high (9ft) statue of a protester on to Lion Rock, a famous outcrop overlooking Hong Kong.\n\nThe statue, Lady Liberty, has become a symbol of the rallies, and sports a gas mask, goggles and a helmet.\n\nShe represents an injured protester who demonstrators believe was shot in the eye by a police projectile.\n\nThe group of several dozen, some wearing head lamps, climbed the 500m peak during a thunderstorm. The statue held a black banner that read: \"Revolution of our time, Liberate Hong Kong.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The \"Lady Liberty\" statue was installed on Hong Kong's Lion Rock overnight by several protesters\n\nHong Kong's protests started in June against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China, a move many feared would undermine the city's judicial independence and endanger dissidents.\n\nThe bill has long been withdrawn, but protests have widened to include demands for full democracy and an inquiry into claims of police brutality.\n\nEarlier this month, the city's government used a colonial-era emergency law to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies - but demonstrators vowed to defy it.\n\nMore than 2,300 people have been arrested since the civil disobedience began.", "description": "China's president says trying to divide China will end in \"crushed bodies\" in a warning to Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F73B/production/_109219236_057269767-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
