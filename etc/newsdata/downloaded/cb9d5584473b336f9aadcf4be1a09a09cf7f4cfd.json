This time we\u2019re talking about a recent incident in Fairfax County, Virginia. A police officer responded to the scene of an automobile accident and began the usual investigation. The driver of one of the vehicles turned out to not have a valid Virginia driver\u2019s license, so the officer ran his name through the DMV and discovered that he was in the country illegally and had a bench warrant out for failing to appear at a deportation hearing.\n\nThe officer had the name of the ICE agent assigned to the case, so he contacted them and waited on the scene for the agent to arrive. The driver received a ticket for driving without a license and was then turned over to immigration officials. What happened next is a sad story of the decline of the rule of law in this country. The cop was almost immediately suspended from his duties on the force. Be sure to read this next bit. (National Review)\n\nFairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler lamented the incident and assured the officer is being disciplined. \u201cThis is an unfortunate issue where the officer was confused,\u201d the police chief said, according to the Washington Post. \u201cWe have trained on this issue a lot. This is the first time we\u2019ve had a lapse in judgment, and the officer is being punished.\u201d The officer has been relieved of all law enforcement duties pending an internal investigation. \u201cOur police officer violated our longstanding policy and deprived a person of their freedom, which is unacceptable,\u201d Roessler added in a statement.\n\nThe woke police chief then went on to extoll the virtues of his county as being \u201cone of the most diverse counties in the nation.\u201d He went on to bemoan the idea that the officer in question had \u201cdamaged their reputation.\u201d\n\nThis is just one small story from the local news in Virginia. The illegal alien was processed by ICE and released with an ankle monitor later that day. But it\u2019s also an episode that reminds us of what\u2019s becoming an epidemic across the country. We have a police chief basically apologizing to an illegal alien because one of his cops enforced the law. He\u2019s repeating whatever the politicians have told him to say in the era of the resistance.\n\nPerhaps the illegal alien will wind up in court for processing now that he\u2019s being tracked. Or maybe he\u2019ll cut the ankle monitor off and disappear like he did last time. We\u2019ll probably never know. But a police officer who was doing his job and enforcing the law is now relieved of his duties and his boss is out there giving press conferences apologizing for his behavior.\n\nWe\u2019ve truly landed on the far side of the rainbow at this point. And since most of these policies are handed down at the state and local levels instead of the federal, I\u2019m at a loss as to what should be done about it. The President has tried to rein in the sanctuary cities and states but has been repeatedly thwarted in the courts. And we\u2019re watching this descent into madness all unfold right before our eyes.", "description": "More insanity", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ICEofficers.jpg"}
