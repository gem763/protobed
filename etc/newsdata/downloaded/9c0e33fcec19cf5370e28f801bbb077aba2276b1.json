Establishment candidates typically have existing ties to the black community\n\nThis will sound tautological, but an establishment candidate is \u2026 well \u2026 established. A candidate who is part of the establishment wing of the Democratic Party likely has fairly strong ties to major constituencies in the party, such as labor unions, women\u2019s rights groups and, of course, black leaders and voters. So when black voters backed Gov. Andrew Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon in New York\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary last year, or Andy Beshear over Adam Edelen in Kentucky\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary earlier this year, that was not shocking. Not only did Beshear and Cuomo spend years developing their own ties with the black communities in their states, but their fathers did, too. (Steve Beshear was governor of Kentucky, Mario Cuomo the governor of New York.)\n\nClinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020 similarly entered the primaries with longstanding ties to black voters. It\u2019s worth considering if the story here is not that establishment candidates are smarter in appealing and connecting with black voters during the campaign, compared to anti-establishment candidates. Maybe it\u2019s that the establishment candidate in a race is likely to be the person who enters the campaign with the strongest support among black voters.", "description": "", "authors": ["Perry Bacon", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features Why-Do-Black-Democrats-Usually-Prefer-Establishment-Candidates"], "top_image": ""}
