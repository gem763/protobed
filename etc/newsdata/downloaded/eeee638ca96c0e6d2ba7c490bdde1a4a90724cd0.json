For how to contact her click here.\n\nDear Katie,\n\nOne evening last year five burglars armed with knives climbed through the kitchen window of my home. They rounded up my family in a bedroom while they went around the house stealing things.\n\nThey threatened to kidnap and rape my daughter, who was pregnant at the time. It was a very traumatic experience.\n\nThey stole all our family jewellery, including items we were wearing at the time of the break-in, which they forced us to remove. Some of this was bought in Singapore nearly 30 years ago and, although we have photos of it, we no longer have the receipts.\n\n...", "description": "Has a company treated you unfairly?", "authors": ["Katie Morley", "Consumer Champion", "Matthew Lynn", "Sam Barker", "Lauren Davidson", "Marianna Hunt", "Taha Lokhandwala", "Stephanie Baxter"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2019/10/03/Veronica-Grech-Telegraph_RGB-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOvVLaKtuhZL6SmPjTfiJ4fIuSn5BDhDfRbgr2TGEw7w.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
