On Monday I will have an announcement about what we have been working on non-stop for over a year. I think you will like it,\" the eccentric bitcoin bull, former fugitive, and antivirus software tycoon tweeted.\n\nMcAfee followed that by sharing a mock up of Sun \u2014 the CEO of Tron, which runs the 13th largest cryptocurrency \u2014 wearing a \"Tron: Legacy\" suit with his company's logo emblazoned on the chest and the tagline, \"Announcing the Announcement.\"\n\nTwitter/John McAfee\n\nMcAfee's tweet made light of Sun's history of promoting the release of future news.

After returning to the US, he posted a bizarre video titled \"How To Uninstall McAfee Antivirus.\"\n\nSoon after, he was arrested on charges of driving under the influence and handgun possession. He also filed paperwork to run in the US presidential election in 2016, and formed his own political party. Since then he has declared his belief in bitcoin, predicting the cryptocurrency will hit $1 million by the end of 2020.\n\nSun, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, rose to fame this year after paying $4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett, and inviting cryptocurrency bosses and President Donald Trump to attend the charity meal. He postponed the lunch at the last minute, blaming a bout of kidney stones.\n\nHowever, Sun apologized on Chinese social media for overhyping himself, and Bloomberg reported Chinese authorities briefly detained Tron employees, fueling conspiracies he was in trouble with the Chinese government.", "description": "John McAfee promoted a mysterious new venture on Twitter by poking fun at Justin Sun's habit of hyping future announcements.
