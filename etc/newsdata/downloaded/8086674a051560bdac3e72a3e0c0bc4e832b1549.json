He could also know details about the subsequent whistleblower complaint that corroborated the conversation that took place in that phone call. He could also have been involved in the White House\u2019s apparent cover-up of all of it.\n\nAll 10 Democrats on the committee wrote to Menashi last month with detailed questions about what he knew about that phone call, the bombshell whistleblower complaint and whether he advised Trump on either matter.\n\nThey gave him until Oct. 7 to respond. He never did.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the committee, says the committee should deny Menashi a vote until he answers their questions.\n\n\u201cSteven Menashi has left questions unanswered about his work at the White House, including his involvement in the White House\u2019s response to the whistleblower complaint,\u201d Feinstein told HuffPost in a Tuesday statement. \u201cMr. Menashi is seeking a lifetime appointment to the court, so his record must be thoroughly examined. The committee shouldn\u2019t vote on his nomination without all of the facts. He must stop evading our questions.\u201d\n\nA White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on whether Menashi should respond to the senators\u2019 questions.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, said the committee should not move forward with Steven Menashi's nomination until he answers Democrats' questions about his potential role in the Ukraine scandal.\n\nIt\u2019s not a great look for Menashi, who already irritated Republicans and Democrats in his confirmation hearing by refusing to answer questions about what issues he\u2019s worked on at the White House. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), for one, told HuffPost last month that he is \u201creal doubtful\u201d about supporting Menashi because of the way he disregarded senators\u2019 questions.\n\n\u201cMy thought is, look, if he\u2019ll treat a United States senator the way he treated us, I wonder how he would treat the people,\u201d Kennedy said at the time.\n\nIt only takes one Republican on the committee to vote no to tank a nomination, assuming all Democrats vote no. Other GOP committee members, including Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.), have not responded to requests for comment on whether they will support Menashi.\n\nProgressive groups, meanwhile, are trying to sink Menashi\u2019s nomination over his long record of opposing and undermining equality for communities of color, women and LGBTQ people. Among other things, Menashi has denounced women\u2019s marches as sexual assault, opposed the \u201cradical abortion rights codified in Roe v. Wade,\u201d and spread the Islamophobic myth that Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines in 1913 with bullets dipped in pig fat.\n\nProtesters filled the hall outside his Senate confirmation hearing last month and got arrested as they shouted \u201cTitle IX is on the line!,\u201d a reference to Menashi serving as legal counsel to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos when she rolled back Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault on campuses.\n\nA spokesman for Graham, the committee\u2019s chairman, did not respond to a request for comment on whether Menashi needs to answer Democratic senators\u2019 questions.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if or when Graham will schedule Menashi\u2019s committee vote.", "description": "Democrats asked Steven Menashi, a White House legal aide, what he knew about the president's potentially impeachable offenses.
