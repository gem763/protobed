Cuomo Pushes Health Officials to Ban Flavored E-Cigarette Sales in the State", "language": "en", "text": "(NEW YORK) \u2014 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed state health officials to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, citing the risk of young people getting addicted to nicotine.\n\nThe Democrat announced Sunday that the state health commissioner would be making a recommendation this week to the state Public Health and Health Planning Council.\n\nThe council can issue emergency regulations that could go into effect in as soon as two weeks.\n\nIn announcing the action, Cuomo sharply criticized the flavors that are for sale, like bubble gum and cotton candy, as being \u201cobviously targeted\u201d to young people.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Agency officials instead said they were studying if flavors could help smokers quit traditional cigarettes.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "New York Gov.
