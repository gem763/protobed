It really doesn\u2019t get much better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSophia was picking up what her dad was putting down, as the commented: \u2018Definitely my father\u2019s daughter.\u2019\n\nSly\u2019s followers were living for the moment, as they took to the comments section and sounded off on the legend moment.\n\n\u2018Tomb Raider and Rambo dad!\u2019 one rightly pointed out, as another remarked: \u2018Still got the guns, sly.\u2019\n\nYes, he does.\n\nMuch like his action man compadre Arnold Schwarzenegger, age is but a number to the Hollywood stalwart.\n\nStill making the bad guys quiver in his stunt-heavy films, Sylvester recently starred as Rambo in this year\u2019s Last Blood.\n\nNo matter how impressive Sly\u2019s moves may be, as he reprised his role as the legendary war veteran in the latest installment, directed by Adam Grunberg, it unfortunately failed to impress David Morrell who penned the original story.\n\nLast month, in an email to Newsweek, Morrell explained that he felt \u2018degraded and dehumanised\u2019 after watching Last Blood at the cinema.\n\nThe author said: \u2018Instead of being soulful, this new movie lacks one. I felt I was less a human being for having seen it, and today that\u2019s an unfortunate message.\u2019\n\nIn addition to the negative reviews, Last Blood has received a rating of just 30% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nSure it\u2019s a run of harsh criticism but we can hardly imagine Sylvester \u2013 who\u2019s reported to be worth $400million (\u00a3310million) \u2013 is letting it keep him up at night.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
