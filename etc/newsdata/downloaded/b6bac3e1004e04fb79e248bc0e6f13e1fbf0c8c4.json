Authorities said the shootings were not intentional but occurred during skirmishes between police and protesters.\n\nMany protesters, police and journalists have been injured in clashes, with police using rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators, some of whom throw bricks and petrol bombs.\n\nA journalist working with Hong Kong\u2019s public broadcaster was recovering in the hospital on Monday after being hit by a petrol bomb on Sunday night.\n\nOn Monday, Hong Kong\u2019s metro rail system was only partially functioning, with many stations torched in protests, and many shops and Chinese banks extensively damaged.\n\nThe Sunday night protests, the second night of violence since the imposition of colonial-era emergency laws on Friday, saw scores of protesters arrested and the first warning from Chinese military personnel stationed in the territory.\n\nRelated Coverage Hong Kong journalist hit by petrol bomb recovering in hospital\n\nTens of thousands of protesters, many families with children, marched peacefully through the center of Hong Kong on Sunday, wearing face masks in defiance of the emergency powers that threaten them with a maximum of one year in prison for hiding their faces.\n\nHowever, police fired tear gas and used baton charges in an attempt to disperse protesters across the Asian financial hub, and the rallies deteriorated into running clashes as night fell.\n\nCarrie Lam, the city\u2019s leader, has said the face mask ban was necessary to end the violence by militant activists. But the move has been criticized by human rights groups and the United Nations, and has sparked more violent protests.\n\n\u201cShe would have to be crazy to be making these decisions on her own without being pressured into them. The face mask business, absolutely madness,\u201d said Patten, who handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\n\n\u201cI fear for the future, unless Carrie Lam actually intervenes and understands the importance of dialogue,\u201d he added.\n\nThe protests have plunged the former British colony into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nThe Hong Kong government said in a statement early on Monday, a public holiday in the city, that \u201cpublic safety has been jeopardized and the public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nA masked anti-government protester leaves after helping to set a fire at the entrance of a metro station, in Hong Kong, China October 6, 2019. REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s increasing grip on the city, which protesters say undermines the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d status promised when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses such accusations, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.\n\nMORE PROTESTS\n\nFurther protests are planned on Monday evening.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s rail operator, MTR Corp, said on Monday that because of \u201cserious vandalism,\u201d most of the stations in the network were temporarily closed. That included typically busy stations such as Admiralty and Wan Chai, around the city\u2019s government offices and bar district.\n\nMTR\u2019s announcement followed an unprecedented shutdown on Saturday and minimal operations on Sunday, which largely paralyzed much of the city.\n\nThe entire network, which typically carries about 5 million passengers a day, will shut at 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) Monday, more than four hours earlier than normal, to allow for repairs, it said.\n\nGrocery stores that had shut early on Sunday were mostly open by Monday morning. Many businesses and stores have had to close repeatedly during the protests, and Hong Kong now faces its first recession in a decade.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nChina\u2019s Hong Kong military garrison warned protesters on Sunday they could be arrested for targeting its barracks with lasers.\n\nChinese military personnel raised a yellow flag with the arrest warning written in large letters, a Reuters witness said, the first direct interaction between the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) and protesters.\n\nThe protesters eventually dispersed.\n\nThe PLA has remained in barracks since the protests started, leaving police to handle the demonstrations, but the PLA\u2019s top brass has warned violence is \u201cabsolutely impermissible.\u201d", "description": "Protest-scarred Hong Kong struggled to recover on Monday after scores of people were arrested in violent clashes overnight and as the last British governor of the Chinese-ruled city warned that people could be killed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437904130&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9602N", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
