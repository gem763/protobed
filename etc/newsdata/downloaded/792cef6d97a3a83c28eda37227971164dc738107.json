An Amazon fulfillment center in Sacramento is seen in the above stock image\n\nThe firing prompted workers to form a group, Amazonians United Sacramento, which circulated a petition demanding the worker's reinstatement\n\nPart-time workers are given 20 hours of unpaid time off each quarter. Whoever surpasses the allotment is considered to have \u2018gone negative.\u2019\n\nIt turned out that Sandra owed the company an hour. So when she got back to work, she was let go.\n\n\u2018I felt like I was in The Twilight Zone,\u2019 Sandra says.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m dealing with a death in my family, and I\u2019m going to lose my job over one hour?\u2019\n\nWhen the other workers at the Sacramento facility heard about Sandra\u2019s dismissal, they were outraged.\n\nSo they formed a Facebook group called Amazonians United Sacramento.\n\nThe group gathered signatures and submitted a petition to the facility manager and Amazon human resources demanding that Sandra be reinstated with back pay.\n\nThe petition also demanded that Amazon grant paid time off to part-time workers.\n\nWhile the petition was circulated among employees, they learned that another worker who took too much time off was let go.\n\nThe woman was fired because she took three days off to make sure her children were protected during a domestic dispute, according to The Verge.\n\n\u2018All I needed was those days to clear it, and then the rest of the week I\u2019m good and ready to work for them,\u2019 the woman said.\n\n\u2018All I needed was time, that\u2019s it.\u2019\n\nThe company, which is considered the most valuable brand in the world, only offers paid time off to full-time employees.\n\n\u2018While Amazon is a trillion dollar company run by the richest man in the world, permanent part-time employees working 8 hour shifts are only allowed 10 days off a year for any reason,\u2019 the petition reads.\n\n\u2018This means that every day we use [unpaid time off] for family emergencies, sickness, or vacation, we are one step closer to termination.\u2019\n\nThe employees at the Sacramento facility - a so-called \u2018last mile\u2019 stop for packages to be sorted before they are delivered to their final destination - say that all of the nearly 500 workers are part-time.\n\nThey also claim that Amazon limits them to fewer than 30 hours of work per week so as to avoid having to provide health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2018They very explicitly put a cap on how many hours you can work a week to keep everybody under having to give them those benefits,\u2019 a Sacramento employee told The Verge.\n\nJob listings for positions at some of Amazon\u2019s facilities indicate that workers are asked to log between 15 and 25 hours a week.\n\nA worker in a Chicago delivery center told The Verge that the company alerts its part-time employees whenever they approach the 30-hour limit and try to take extra shifts.\n\nThe company has come under fire from part-time workers who say they are not allowed to work beyond 30 hours, thus failing to qualify for health insurance and other benefits\n\nAn employee in a Chicago delivery center told The Verge that workers are fired automatically if the computer detects that they have taken more than the allotted number of unpaid hours off.\n\n\u2018They just have a computer program that automatically fires people, no human oversight over what the conditions or concerns might have been,\u2019 the employee said.\n\nAs a result, workers say that limited amount of time off they can take makes it hard to work a second job or tend to unforeseen family emergencies.\n\nThe company disputed the workers\u2019 claims, saying that firings are not automatic.\n\nAmazon says it takes individuals\u2019 circumstances into account on a case-by-case basis before making a decision to terminate someone\u2019s employment.\n\nThe company said that while Amazon doesn\u2019t pay for medical insurance, it does offer vision and dental coverage as well as funding for medical expenses.\n\nAmazon also says workers get 20 hours of unpaid time off per quarter in addition to three days paid bereavement leave and accrued sick leave.\n\nWhen asked about the petition, Amazon said: \u2018Amazon maintains an open-door policy that encourages employees to bring their comments, questions, and concerns directly to their management team for discussion and resolution.\n\n\u2018We have a long standing policy of not commenting on personnel matters.\u2019\n\nAfter the petition was submitted, Amazon rehired both Sandra and the other woman, Amazonians United Sacramento announced on Facebook.\n\n\u2018Sandra\u2019s rehiring shows without a doubt that Amazon workers have power when we work together and stand up for our dignity and rights at work,\u2019 the group wrote on Facebook.\n\nThere is no word as to whether Amazon has agreed to the workers\u2019 demands to change its time-off policy.\n\nLast Wednesday, some 60 employees at an Amazon warehouse in Egan, Minnesota walked out on their jobs to protest night shift wages and the 30-hour weekly cap.\n\nAmazon agreed to hold talks to resolve the issues.", "description": "The firing of an employee at an Amazon facility in Sacramento prompted colleagues to form a group, Amazonians United Sacramento (inset), on Facebook.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/22/19414804-0-image-a-84_1570483363567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
