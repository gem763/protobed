Their ambassadors are due to meet in Brussels on Sunday morning.\n\nThe British parliament voted in favor on Saturday of an amendment that withheld support for the Brexit deal and as a result, Johnson is obliged, by law, to request a postponement.\n\nJohnson has insisted that he will not seek a delay beyond Oct. 31 and he reiterated that in parliament after the vote, though he has not explained how he will get around it.\n\nThe EU 27 has already agreed twice to postpone Brexit from the original deadline of March 29 this year.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "EU chiefs are so fed up with Brexit that when they clinched a deal with PM Johnson they did not want to entertain the need to delay Britain\u2019s departure", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/251899_6705112_updates.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
