Shares\n\nWhat you may not see on TV this Thanksgiving season Professional football on Thanksgiving Day has become as much of an American tradition as turkey. Yet, what happens after the game \u2014 and what is often not aired by major media networks \u2014 may be the best and most traditional way to celebrate the holiday. Shares\n\n'Growing in Faith With Golf Friends' Does the title of this article sound like an oxymoron? If you're a golfer, when was the last time you turned to your walking or riding partner and said, \"How is it with you and your faith?\" Shares\n\n710 ESPN Seattle's podcast shares authentic stories about faith and sports I had no idea that I would spend two hours talking to my old college rival Ryan Leaf. I had no idea that I would shed tears with 1984 American League Rookie of the Year Alvin Davis, a man I met for the first time right before we turned on the mics. And I had no idea that a conversation with Hall of Fame wide receiver and former Oklahoma Rep. Steve Largent would go so deeply into a broken upbringing and radical forgiveness.

Shares\n\nAn Olympic medalist's credo: 'Success is really being the best you can be on a daily basis' Sports has always been part of my life.

Shares\n\nReimaging sports through faith If God is not the reference point for sports, sports will unavoidably devolve into idolatry, worshiping man as a demigod.

Shares\n\nCoaches, athletes, fans and faith in the watching world of sports Coaches and athletes impact a watching world through their sport and the lives they lead on and off the playing field. These two areas are interconnected in ways that may not be apparent at first glance but, in reality, cannot be separated. Shares\n\nRelying on faith to find 'common ground' in sports Sports are typically a zero-sum game. For one side to win, the other side has to lose.
