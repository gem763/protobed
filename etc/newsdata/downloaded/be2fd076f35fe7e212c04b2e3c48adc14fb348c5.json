Bertens was pipped for the final spot by Belinda Bencic after the Swiss, who defeated Petra Kvitova 6-3 1-6 6-4 later Tuesday, won the title in Moscow just over a week ago.\n\nAnd it came only a few weeks after Barty saved a match point against Bertens in the semifinals of a tournament in Beijing. A win in that match would have sealed Bertens' spot at the year-end championships.\n\nIt wasn't Ashleigh Barty's day at the WTA Finals, as she was upset by alternate Kiki Bertens.\n\nBarty slipped to 1-1 in the group stage although a defeat seemed highly unlikely early in the second set. The Australian led by a break on two different occasions including 3-2, well on course to extend her record over Bertens to a perfect 6-0.\n\nBut the French Open champion's all-around game gradually waned and Bertens, who can similarly defend and attack in equal measure, prospered. Bertens had to withstand a comeback in the final set, shutting the door after a 4-0 lead became 4-3. She notched up a tour-leading 55th win despite dealing with understandable fatigue.\n\nA long stretch\n\nBertens has played in tournaments every week since the US Open, including last week at the Elite Trophy -- a secondary year-end championships -- in Zhuhai near Shenzhen.\n\nShe admitted she was \"OK sitting on the couch\" before getting the call to play.\n\n\"I was really tired,\" Bertens told reporters, according to the WTA . \"But then yesterday I hit for five or 10 minutes. I just rested completely.\n\n\"I think today I already felt much better. Of course, it's not like after one day you are completely back to full energy. Of course, you're like, 'OK, one more, one more.' That keeps me going. We see how far I can go.\"\n\nKiki Bertens entered the year-end championships as an alternate for the second straight year.\n\nIt was just two years ago that Bertens considered quitting tennis even with all the success she was enjoying. The fun had dissipated and she was increasingly weighed down. That came after a health scare when she was diagnosed with a mass on her thyroid gland. A year elapsed before Bertens was told the mass wasn't cancerous.\n\nBencic faced Kvitova in the other Red Group encounter, with both looking for a first win this week.\n\nWhile Bencic finished the regular season strongly -- reaching the semifinals at the US Open -- an arm injury hampered Kvitova following a blistering start to 2019. She suspected it might have been linked to being attacked in her home and suffering a career-threatening hand injury in 2016.\n\nJUST WATCHED Naomi Osaka reflects on a rollercoaster 2019 Replay More Videos ...
