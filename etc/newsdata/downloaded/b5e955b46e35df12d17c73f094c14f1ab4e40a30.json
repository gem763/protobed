First, it would treat Americans differently according to where they live. The popular vote currently gives every citizen\u2014Californians and Texans, Hawaiians and Mainers, Alabamans and Oregonians\u2014an equal say in choosing the president. An electoral college would solve this problem by giving Americans in some states more influence than Americans in other states. Those benefits would largely be felt by smaller rural states, whose residents deserve to wield disproportionate levels of influence in our political system.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. Had the country used an electoral college in the 2016 election, an elector from California would have represented roughly 712,000 people, while an elector from Wyoming would have represented just 195,000 people. That imbalance might seem unfair to some political observers, particularly among Democrats and liberals. But they are hardly unbiased in this matter. After all, they have a vested interest in defending an electoral system that would favor their preferred outcomes, and I do not.\n\nCreating an electoral college would also reduce the political influence of Americans who live in territories like Guam and Puerto Rico. Under the popular vote, they would enjoy an equal say in choosing their president. But because electors are divvied up among states, they would lose that status under the electoral college. Maybe this is for the best. As one National Review contributor pointed out when arguing against Puerto Rico\u2019s statehood earlier this year, the island\u2019s three million American citizens largely speak Spanish and live under a mismanaged government. Why should their votes count equally alongside those cast in corruption-free, fiscally sound states like Illinois and Kansas?\n\n\n\nThe electoral college would simplify presidential elections in other ways, too. It\u2019s possible that some states would choose to allocate their electors in a proportional fashion. Modern political polarization makes it more likely that they\u2019ll adopt a winner-take-all system instead, where candidates can capture a state\u2019s entire slate of electors with a mere plurality of the vote. Critics somehow see this as a downside. They argue that it would disenfranchise large swaths of Americans across the country\u2014conservatives in bright-blue California and New York, liberals in ruby-red Alabama and Utah, and those who don\u2019t quite fit in to either camp.\n\nOn the contrary, it would only effectively disenfranchise them. Those voters could still cast ballots for president; they just wouldn\u2019t matter most of the time. And there are benefits to shrinking the electorate as well. Candidates won\u2019t have to waste time traveling across the country and trying to appeal to as many voters as possible. Instead, they could win just by focusing on small pockets of them. Most presidential elections would likely end up focusing on a handful of \u201cbattleground\u201d states where either of the two major-party candidates might prevail. So instead of forcing the entire country to fully participate in the democratic process, the electoral college would relegate most of that burden to just part of it.", "description": "What would it sound like if someone proposed the Electoral College for the first time today?", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/55c1393edaccf3c4b2db5daeaadd1b1fb6e67014.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
