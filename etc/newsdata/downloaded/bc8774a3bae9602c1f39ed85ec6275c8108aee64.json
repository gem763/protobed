People up to 53 miles away could experience temporary blindness.\n\nBut a longer-term threat would come in the minutes and hours after that explosion.\n\nNuclear explosions can produce clouds of dust and sandlike radioactive particles that disperse into the atmosphere \u2013 what\u2019s referred to as nuclear fallout. Exposure to this fallout can result in radiation poisoning, which could damage the body\u2019s cells and prove fatal.\n\nThe debris takes about 15 minutes to reach ground level after an explosion, so a person\u2019s response during that period could be a matter of life and death.\n\nHere are the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to remember in the event of a nuclear attack.\n\nDO: Drop to the ground with your face down and your hands tucked under your body.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends this position because it will keep your hands, arms, and face away from any flying debris or sweltering heat that could burn your skin. Once the shockwaves have subsided, you can get up and look for shelter.\n\nRead more: If a nuclear bomb is dropped on your city, here\u2019s where you should run and hide\n\nDON\u2019T: Stare directly at the blast.\n\ncaption President Donald Trump looks up toward a solar eclipse without glasses on August 21, 2017. source Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nDepending on how close you are to a nuclear explosion, it might be impossible to avoid the initial burst of light, which can blind you for about 15 seconds to a minute. But for those farther away, it\u2019s best to avert and cover your eyes, according to the CDC.\n\nA 1-megaton bomb (that\u2019s about 80 times larger than the \u201cLittle Boy\u201d atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan) could temporarily blind people up to 13 miles away on a clear day, and up to 53 miles away on a clear night.\n\nDO: Cover your face with a towel or article of clothing.\n\ncaption Cover your face like Serena Williams is here. source Reuters/Kevin Lamarque\n\nIf you have a scarf or handkerchief nearby at the time of a nuclear explosion, it\u2019s wise to cover your nose and mouth. Even before fallout reaches the ground, an explosion stirs up other debris that might be dangerous to breathe in.\n\nDON\u2019T: Seek shelter in your car.\n\nsource Issei Kato/Reuters\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) advises people not to take shelter in their vehicles. Cars\u2019 glass windows and metal frames make them too flimsy to protect you from nuclear fallout. Driving away is also futile, since it\u2019s tough to anticipate where radiation will travel.\n\nThe one exception to this rule is ducking inside your car in an underground parking garage, which could provide an added layer of protection.\n\nDO: Find a brick or concrete building, such as a school or office.\n\nFEMA identifies brick or concrete buildings as the safest forms of shelter after a nuclear attack. Ideally, the best shelter would have few to no windows and a basement for camping out.\n\nSchools or offices usually meet these criteria. Mobile homes, however, are considered too fragile to offer enough protection.\n\nIf there aren\u2019t any sturdy buildings within 15 minutes of where you\u2019re standing, it\u2019s better to find some form of shelter than stay outside. If you discover that there\u2019s a safer building close by, wait at least an hour before attempting to move. By that time, the potential for radiation exposure would likely have decreased by around 55%.\n\nDON\u2019T: Stand near windows once you\u2019re indoors.\n\nIf you take cover in multistory building, choose a central location and steer clear of the top and bottom floors.\n\nIf your structure has windows, FEMA advises standing far away from them, in the center of a room. That\u2019s because shockwaves can shatter windows up to 10 miles away from an explosion, resulting in flying glass that could injure people who are too close.\n\nDO: Shut off heaters and air conditioners.\n\nHeating or air-conditioning units pull in air from the outside, so they could spread contaminated particles throughout your home or shelter.\n\nDON\u2019T: Search for your family members right away.\n\nsource Reuters\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services recommends staying indoors for at least 24 hours in the event of a nuclear explosion. After 48 hours, the exposure rate from a 10-kiloton explosion (the type that might damage but not destroy a city) goes down to just 1%.\n\n\u201cWhile sheltering is a priority for protecting public health, it goes against natural instincts,\u201d a collection of government agencies wrote in a 2010 report. \u201cAfter a nuclear detonation, people will need to understand why they and their families are safest staying sheltered.\u201d\n\nDO: Take a shower as soon as possible.\n\nPeople who were outside during an explosion should shower as soon as possible, making sure the water is warm and soap is applied gently. Scrubbing too hard could break your skin, which acts as a natural protective barrier.\n\nYou should also cover any cuts or abrasions while you\u2019re rinsing off. For those without access to a shower, FEMA recommends using a sink or faucet. The next-best option is to clean your body with a wipe or wet cloth. Blowing your nose and wiping your ears and eyelids is also important, since debris could get stuck in these orifices.\n\nDON\u2019T: Use conditioner after you shampoo.\n\nRinsing your hair with shampoo is critical after being exposed to radiation, but conditioner is a major no-no, according to the CDC.\n\nThat\u2019s because conditioners carry compounds called cationic surfactants, which bind to radioactive particles and can trap them in your hair. They\u2019d essentially act like glue between your hair and radioactive material.\n\nAs a general rule, it\u2019s best to only use products on your body that are designed to get rinsed off in the aftermath of a nuclear disaster. Items like body lotion and face cream should wait until a second or third wish.\n\nRead more: The US government warns people against using conditioner after a nuclear explosion. It could trap radiation in your hair.\n\nDO: Seal away contaminated clothes.\n\nBecause outer layers of clothing would likely be contaminated by fallout, the CDC recommends sealing them in a plastic bag that\u2019s out of the reach of children and pets. You should also seal off any tissues or cloths used to wipe your body or face.\n\nDON\u2019T: Eat unpackaged food or food that was left outside.\n\nFollowing any kind of nuclear explosion, the CDC says it\u2019s all right to consume food from sealed containers such packages, bottles, or cans. You can also eat things from your pantry or refrigerator, as long as you wipe off food containers, cookware, counters, and utensils.\n\nBut anything that was left uncovered, especially if it was outdoors \u2013 such as fruits or veggies from a garden \u2013 would be unsafe to eat.\n\nDO: Listen to the radio for instructions.\n\nsource Lambert/Getty Images\n\nNuclear explosions produce a powerful phenomenon called a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP), an invisible burst of energy that can slash power, phone, and internet lines. A nuclear EMP could also disrupt radio waves, but that\u2019s less likely, since radios have a simpler circuitry.\n\nSo in the wake of an explosion, emergency-response officials will likely broadcast safety instructions over the radio. Unless these officials tell you it\u2019s safe to go outside, it\u2019s best to stay put until the risk of contamination has gone down.", "description": "Business Insider - After seeking shelter, a few life-saving measures could reduce your exposure to nuclear fallout after an explosion..
