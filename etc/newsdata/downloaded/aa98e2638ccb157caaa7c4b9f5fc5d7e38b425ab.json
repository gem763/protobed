It\u2019s better than last year, it\u2019s gold-silver for us, instead of gold-bronze,\u201d joked Nagornyy.\n\nHowever, Nagornyy expected to spend Friday night worrying about wife Daria Spiridonova, who qualified in second place for Saturday\u2019s uneven bars.\n\nSpiridonova, 21, won the 2015 world title but faces stiff competition in the final from US star Simone Biles and reigning champion Nina Derwael of Belgium.\n\n\u201cI am very nervous for her, more than I am for myself,\u201d he said, with the couple who married in December to spend the night apart.\n\nNagornyy is also in action again on Saturday in the floor exercise.\n\n\u201cWe try not to disturb each other during competition and I will probably only see her briefly in the morning,\u201d he added.\n\nNagornyy finished 1.607 points ahead of Dalaloyan while Ukraine\u2019s Oleg Verniaiev, who had surgery on both ankles in January, took bronze.\n\n\u201cI am so very happy, I didn\u2019t come here to win and didn\u2019t expect to get on the podium. I still need more time,\u201d said Verniaiev.\n\nDalaloyan paid the price after a rare mistake on his landing from the vault saw him finish 18th in the discipline.\n\nChina\u2019s Xiao Ruoteng, the 2017 world champion and 2018 silver medallist, finished fourth after a fall on the horizontal bar left him in 21st place in that event.\n\nNagornyy had the highest score in two of the six events \u2014 the vault and rings \u2014 and finished in the top three on the floor and parallel bars.\n\nIt was his second gold medal in Stuttgart after Russia won the team competition on Wednesday.\n\nJapan\u2019s Olympic champion Kohei Uchimura, who has won the all-around world title a record six times, is missing from Stuttgart after struggling for form after injury.", "description": "Stuttgart (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 Russia\u2019s Nikita Nagornyy expected a sleepless night in Stuttgart after winning the men\u2019s all-around world", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/7d6b5d_new-world-champion-nikita-nagornyy-celebrates-artur-dalaloyan-as-russia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
