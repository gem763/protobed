REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nTrudeau arrived 90 minutes late to a rally outside of Toronto wearing the bulky protection under his shirt after he had received a security threat. No details have been provided by the Liberal Party or police.\n\n\u201cMy first concern was for the safety of my family and for all the Canadians in the room,\u201d Trudeau told reporters after helping volunteers pack boxes of food for needy families on Canada\u2019s Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n\u201cThis will not change at all how I campaign,\u201d Trudeau said. Trudeau - sleeves rolled up and not wearing a jacket - did not appear to be wearing a protective vest and security kept its distance compared with the tight circle they formed around him on Saturday.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with Saturday\u2019s rally was taken with the advice from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Trudeau said.\n\nTrudeau - his campaign thrown off balance when pictures of him wearing blackface as a younger man emerged - is running in a statistical tie with his main rival, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, polls show. But the left-leaning New Democrats (NDP) are gaining and could end up with the balance of power.\n\nOn Sunday, Trudeau said the Conservative Party was fueling divisiveness, though he said he did not blame the party\u2019s tactics for creating Saturday\u2019s security problem.\n\nConservatives \u201cfeel personal attacks and lying to Canadians is the only way they can get elected,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s message to Canadians sitting down for their Thanksgiving meal was that Conservatives would bring only \u201ccuts and austerity\u201d if elected, whereas the Liberals would invest in the country\u2019s future.\n\nTrudeau also took the opportunity to encourage progressive voters not to choose the NDP over Liberals, saying it could end up putting the Conservatives in power.\n\n\u201cIf you want to stop Conservative cuts, you have to elect a progressive government, not a progressive opposition,\u201d he said.\n\nLate on Saturday, both Scheer and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh condemned the security threat against Trudeau.\n\n\u201cThreats of violence against political leaders have absolutely no place in our democracy,\u201d Scheer said, adding that it was \u201cupsetting\u201d that Trudeau had to wear a bulletproof vest.\n\nSingh said any threat to a party leader \u201cis troubling to all of us\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo matter how you vote or believe, no one should face threats of violence,\u201d Singh said.", "description": "Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday that he will not change the way he is campaigning ahead of the Oct. 21 federal election after a security threat forced him to wear a bulletproof vest at a campaign rally on Saturday.", "authors": ["Stephane Mahe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440430220&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0JP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
