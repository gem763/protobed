Photo: HBO\n\nIn the interest of getting more perspective on what happened in Succession\u2019s superb season-two finale, Vulture turned to the man in charge of it all. No, not Logan Roy. We spoke to Jesse Armstrong, the creator of Succession and the writer of \u201cThis Is Not for Tears\u201d to find out what went down between Kendall and his father, how they filmed the episode on an actual yacht, and why Logan has such a cryptic smile on his face at the end of the season. Here\u2019s what Armstrong had to say, with the caveat that he is very committed to letting viewers reach their own conclusions about what they saw. \u201cI\u2019m happy to leave it for people to decide,\u201d he says.\n\nI want to ask you about the John Berryman poem \u201cDream Song 29.\u201d The title of this season\u2019s finale, \u201cThis Is Not for Tears,\u201d comes from that poem. So does the title of last season\u2019s finale, \u201cNobody Is Ever Missing,\u201d Can you talk about the relationship between that poem and the show?\n\n\ufeffYeah, I\u2019ll try. I\u2019m a bit averse to doing too much analysis because I want people to have their own reaction to the show. The show is the best expression of the show. Forgive me if I\u2019m reluctant to over-explicate or make things plain.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s true about that poem. It has a terrifying sense of that feeling Kendall has at the end of the last season, wondering if something could have happened. In Berryman\u2019s poem\u2019s case, in the end, [a death] hasn\u2019t happened. But it has happened to Kendall. When I was looking at possibilities, that line struck me as pertinent to this episode as well.\n\nWhen you broke the story for the season and decided there was going to be a blood sacrifice, did you consider sacrificing characters other than Kendall? Or was it always going to be Kendall?\n\n\ufeffThe structure was down early on. The ending came even before that [\u201cblood sacrifice\u201d] phrase from Logan. We enjoyed rehearsing the different people Logan might consider, but [Kendall] was set from early on.\n\nEpisode nine ends with Logan calling for a sacrifice. I feel like a lot of viewers got so focused on that question that we didn\u2019t wonder, What would happen next? How might the person being sacrificed respond? Were you intentionally directing us that way, so that we wouldn\u2019t think about the ending?\n\n\ufeffNo, that wasn\u2019t a mislead. We tend not to do obfuscation or red herrings. I was happy that the ending might be a surprise and a shock. Not revealing precisely what Greg\u2019s and Kendall\u2019s intentions and thoughts are, that\u2019s really quite brief. On the whole, that wasn\u2019t an idea to mislead.\n\nI was curious about where the episode was filmed. Where did you shoot and how did you find that beautiful yacht?\n\n\ufeffThat was the great work of Scott Ferguson, our producer. [Episode director] Mark Mylod and I were pretty demanding about the kind of opulence that these people have. We said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, we should reflect what it really is like.\u201d Scott had a hell of a job trying to find one of these yachts. As you can imagine, the people who own them are not the sort of people who are interested in doing a film-shoot deal. It was tough to find, but Scott persevered. There were discussions about where it could be if it wasn\u2019t on a yacht. He really came through and managed to find an affordable way to do this. For a number of reasons, we really wanted it to be on a yacht.\n\nI\u2019m guessing one of those reasons is that the Roys are isolated and trapped. They can\u2019t just walk out when they\u2019re on a boat.\n\n\ufeffExactly. It has loads of practical advantages that have resonances to stuff that happens in the show, that\u2019s resonant to stuff that\u2019s happening in the real world. It was what we really wanted.\n\nWhere was it shot?\n\n\ufeffIn Croatia, nearer to Dra\u0161nice.\n\nWere the interiors on the yacht as well, or on a soundstage?\n\n\ufeffOh no, that\u2019s all on location. We do almost everything on location. I think it\u2019s good for the show. So all of those interiors are the real interiors.\n\nI\u2019m going to ask you a couple of things that you may or may not want to talk about in too much detail. But I\u2019m going to ask you out of curiosity.\n\n\ufeffI\u2019ll try to say something if I can.\n\nAt the end of the finale, it\u2019s clear that Greg held on to some of those documents that he and Tom had been burning. He seems to have them in his possession when Kendall is speaking during the press conference. But we don\u2019t actually see Kendall and Greg discuss this. I assume that\u2019s something they worked out on the plane. Is that a fair assumption? And why did you want to leave that out \u2014 just for the sense of surprise?\n\nI\u2019m happy to leave it for people to decide. Me and Nic [Braun] and Jeremy [Strong] discuss this kind of stuff and they\u2019re happy with the advantage we have. I think it\u2019s fun for people to make their own decisions about precisely where those agreements and decisions are made. There\u2019s enough in the episode that would lead you to make some assumptions.\n\nThere\u2019s a wonderful close-up on Brian Cox\u2019s face in the final moments of the episode, as Logan watches Kendall throw him under the bus. He flashes a little hint of a smile, or at least what I perceived as a smile. Was that in the script?\n\n\ufeffThere\u2019s a script direction for him to give that kind of look. Brian\u2019s so brilliant that you get many layers. He\u2019s such an amazing actor. He\u2019s giving a brilliant performance, and I like that people, as you do in life, are trying to make a decision about what he\u2019s feeling.\n\nMy colleagues and I had a debate after the episode: Is it fair to assume that Logan was genuinely surprised by what Kendall did? Earlier in the episode, one of the shareholders suggests that he should step down. Is it possible he sacrificed Kendall knowing that Kendall might retaliate?\n\n\ufeffOkay, wow. It\u2019s fun to hear that people are coming up with their own interpretations like that. It feels unseemly, given the work we all do to create [the show], to then impose some binary decisions. I\u2019ll just say, the show is the best version of the show. I\u2019m happy for people to engage with it.\n\nLooking ahead, at what point in the process are you with regard to season three? Do you have a general sense of where it might go?\n\n\ufeffYeah, I like to open up the writers\u2019 room with a bunch of things to test everyone or give them things to react against. I haven\u2019t started it yet, but I have a bunch of research and a bunch of thoughts about what should happen, but they will be very much open to being fortified, disproved, kicked around, laughed at, and expunged.\n\nWhen does the writers\u2019 room regroup for season three?\n\n\ufeffWithin a month or so.\n\nYou wrote this season quite some time ago. But watching it at this particular moment, as we read about whistle-blowers and people testifying on the Hill as part of Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry, that really added another layer to the experience. Do you think about that broader political context in terms of how the show will land, or is it something you can\u2019t even contemplate?\n\n\ufeffWhat we don\u2019t do, obviously, is try and predict that the ambassador to Ukraine will be fired or something like that. We heavily research. I come with a ton of stuff. We check out everything we do with other people. We\u2019re in the culture just like everyone else is, and it\u2019s a show that has a relationship to the real world. All the writers and myself have feelings and thoughts about what\u2019s happening in the U.S. and the wider world. We\u2019re not ripping stuff straight from the headlines and throwing it into the show. We\u2019re taking what feels like it\u2019s around and fitting it to the characters we have. Then we\u2019re in a good place to accidentally hit on themes in reality.
