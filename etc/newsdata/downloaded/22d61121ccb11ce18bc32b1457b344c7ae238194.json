They also told the whistleblower that White House lawyers were already discussing how to handle the call because they believed they'd witnessed Trump \"abuse his office for personal gain.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, it surfaced that Maguire and the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, referred the complaint to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.\n\nBut the Justice Department's criminal division reviewed the whistleblower's complaint and determined that there were no grounds for an investigation of Trump's behavior. Officials decided that the memo of Trump's phone call with Zelensky didn't show him violating campaign finance laws by asking for a financial contribution or an \"item of tangible value.\"", "description": "Michael Atkinson said Trump's actions raise \"counterintelligence risks with respect to foreign intelligence services aware of such alleged conduct.\"", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth", "Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8d102c2e22af688c1d5f56?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
