Later that month, Abe apologized to family members of the former patients.\n\nIt was the first ruling ordering the state to compensate family members of leprosy patients who suffered discrimination as they were isolated in sanatoriums under the government's segregation policy dating back to 1931.\n\nThe government is working on new measures to compensate those who suffered discrimination regardless of whether they participated in the lawsuit.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "A group of Japanese lawmakers has approved a plan to provide up to 1.8 million yen each in compensation to family members of former leprosy patients.
