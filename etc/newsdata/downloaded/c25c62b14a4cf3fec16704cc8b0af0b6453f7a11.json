These are their stories.\n\n\"Life is a fight,\" says Mohamed Ma'alem, the founder of the Brussels Boxing Academy (BBA) in Molenbeek. \"For everyone, for anyone.\"\n\nBut in 14-year-old Salma Ben Abdesselam, he thinks he has a fighter who might just be up to the challenge.\n\n\"She is a force,\" he says of the schoolgirl whose parents were born in Morocco and who considers herself both Moroccan and Belgian. \"She has huge inner strength.\"\n\nSalma trains every day at the BBA, a club with 600 members located in an old school gym, where her father, Hamid Ben Abdesselam, is one of her coaches.\n\nFor the club's fighters and its trainers, boxing is much more than a pastime.\n\n\"[It's] a form of education. It's a discipline. Boxing is what connects us,\" explains trainer Mohammed Idrissi.\n\nThe club offers young people \"an anchor, a place where they can find an identity,\" says trainer Tom Flachet.\n\nBut they are acutely aware that they must represent not only themselves and their club but their district, which has long been portrayed as a \"hotbed of radicalism\".\n\nFollowing the coordinated attacks in Paris on November 13, 2015, and bombings at Brussels airport and metro in 2016, police raided homes in Molenbeek, arresting several people suspected of being involved.\n\n\"Every time I turned on the TV, there was only that,\" says Salma.\n\nIt created a feeling of unease, compounding a sense that their community was viewed with negativity and suspicion because of its multiculturalism, her father explains.\n\nAnd for the BBA, it touched very close to home.\n\nAhmed Dahmani was a BBA champion. He was arrested on suspicion he had links with the Paris attackers.\n\n\"We think of him as one of ours,\" says Tom. \"He was a good boxer.\"\n\n\"After what happened in Paris, they looked for him and found him pretty quickly. They googled his name and found him here, at the club.\"\n\nThe BBA was closed down, at the exact time its trainers felt the district's young people most needed it.\n\nBut up and running again, it has a lot to prove - as does Salma, who will be fighting at the Belgian Championships in Ghent. Will she be able to return as a champion and strike a blow for her club's vision of unity and mutual respect?\n\nThis is their story. This is Europe.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "Young boxers at a Moroccan migrant-founded gym counter stereotypes that their neighbourhood is a 'hotbed of radicalism'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/8/29/f28b15e40af2405c8bf391c17dc6a860_18.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-29"}
