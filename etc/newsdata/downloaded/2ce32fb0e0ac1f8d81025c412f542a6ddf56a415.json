It is not class size that dictates the quality of education,\" he said.\n\n\"Our year 6 classroom has got 67 children in one room. There are times when one teacher teaches those 67 children. Is that wrong? Of course it is not wrong.\n\n\"Our year 6 classroom is designed like a lecture theatre: I can seat 67 children in there. I know I will be public enemy No 1 by saying this.\u201d\n\nBroadclyst Community Primary School uses vast amounts of technology in its classrooms.\n\nThere are multiple interactive screens for teaching, and each child has their own tablet and a digital pen at their allocated seat. Ceiling are also dotted with speakers to give an immersive surround sound.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nWhat's more regular video blogs keep parents updated along with parent apps, virtual tours are offered of the school.\n\nSchool meetings are broadcasted live and traditional parents\u2019 evenings can also be conducted online via a live link with teachers for those parents who can\u2019t make it into school.\n\nBut Mr Bishop told Devon Live last year that the 'school is using technology as a tool rather than a replacement for its traditional teaching and learning'.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn my 25 years here we have always endeavoured to embrace the latest technologies and to use them as a tool to support both teaching and learning.\n\n(Image: Devon Live WS)\n\n\u201cTherefore, we have always been at the cutting edge of not just embedding some of the latest technology into school but utilising it within their learning.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen it as a replacement for teachers or other learning tools because technology is not the answer to everything. Reading, writing and mathematics are core skills that are needed to unlock the wider curriculum.\"\n\nAccording to figures there were 402,000 children in classes of more than 30 pupils which equates to a 44 per cent rise in five years.\n\nAnd almost 22,000 pupils were taught in classes with at least 36 pupils, This compares with 14,000 five years earlier.\n\nAlthough the average class size is about 32 at Dr Challoner\u2019s Grammar School in Amersham, Bucks , but some sixth-form classes accommodate 210 pupils.\n\nHead teacher David Atkinson said: \u201cWe were once one of the lowest-funded schools in England and have been making savings and cuts for years.\u201d\n\n(Image: Devon Live WS)\n\nExperts claim the UK is moving towards giant classes found in parts of Asia and that Brit parents now opting to send their kids to private school.\n\nAlan Smithers, professor of education at Buckingham University, told the newspaper: \"We are moving towards the style of giant classes found in Far East countries like Singapore, where one teacher can be in charge of up to 100 pupils. Funding cuts and teacher shortages are pushing schools to ever larger class sizes.\n\n\u201cThose who say that the quality of education can be maintained in such huge classes are mistaken. In some circumstances this can be made to work, but for young children personal attention is vital and they can get lost in large classes.\n\n\"Private schools are so attractive to parents because of their class sizes, which are about 12 or 13 children to a teacher.\u201d", "description": "Broadclyst Community Primary School, in Exter Devon, which has an average class size of 42, has built a lecture-theatre style room to accommodate its bumper class.", "authors": ["Brendan Mcfadden", "Image", "Devon Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20570409.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Super-size-class-packs-in-SIXTY-SEVEN-children-with-just-one-teacher-at-cash-strapped-school.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
