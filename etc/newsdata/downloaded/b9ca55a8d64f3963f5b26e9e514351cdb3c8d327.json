It's a brain-bleedingly bonkers move, and show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have responded in typical South Park fashion\u2014by penning an extremely tongue-in-cheek \"apology\" to China and releasing the entire episode online.\n\n\"We too love money more than freedom and democracy,\" the duo said in their statement. \"Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\"\n\nChina, unsurprisingly, has not accepted their gracious apology (and it remains to be seen whether this whole thing is just a meta-stunt), but at least now you can watch \"Band in China\" online for free.
