Stand with Hong Kong.\"\n\nHis apology had drawn more than a thousand replies as of 10 a.m. Monday Hong Kong time (10 p.m. Sunday ET), most of them urging him not to apologize.\n\nThousands of Hong Kongers have protested for four months over anxiety about Beijing's creeping influence over the city, which the British handed over to China in 1997. Those protests have become increasingly violent.\n\nThe National Basketball Association is now China's most popular sports league and has formed partnerships with some of the country's biggest tech companies. It also opened NBA retail stores there.", "description": "Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey killed a tweet that reportedly said, \"Fight for Freedom.
