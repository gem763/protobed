Spain's former dictator known as 'El Caudillo' who ruled with an iron fist Former Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco (L) speaks from the balcony of Madrid's Royal Palace next to the then Prince Juan Carlos of Spain Franco ruled Spain between 1939 and 1975, after he and other officers led a military insurrection against the Spanish democratic government in 1936, a move that started a three-year civil war. A staunch Catholic, he viewed the war and ensuing dictatorship as something of a religious crusade against anarchist, leftist and secular tendencies in Spain. His authoritarian rule, along with a profoundly conservative Catholic Church, ensured that Spain remained virtually isolated from political, industrial and cultural developments in Europe for nearly four decades. The country returned to democracy three years after his death but his legacy and his place in Spanish political history still sparks rancor and passion. For many years, thousands of people commemorated the anniversary of his Nov. 20, 1975 death in Madrid's central Plaza de Oriente esplanade and at the Valley of the Fallen mausoleum. Although the dictator's popularity has waned immensely, the exhumation has been criticized by Franco's relatives, Spain's three main right-wing parties and some members of the Catholic Church for opening old political wounds. Franco, who died in 1975, ruled Spain with an iron fist after his Nationalists won the bloody civil war of 1936-39\n\nHis critics have accused him of electioneering, with the closed-door operation beginning today just over a fortnight before Spain goes to the polls.\n\n'I feel a great deal of rage because they have used something as cowardly as digging up a corpse, using a body as propaganda and political publicity to win a handful of votes before an election,' said Franco's eldest grandson last night.\n\nMacarena Martinez Bordiu, a distant relative of the dictator, said she felt 'outraged' with what was happening and accused the government of 'desecrating a tomb.'\n\nWith media banned from the event, only a select few people - Justice Minister Dolores Delgado, a forensics expert, a priest and the 22 relatives - were there to witness the exhumation get under way.\n\nCameras and mobile phones were banned from the ceremony to stop the exhumation itself being filmed.\n\nA brief prayer was said after the coffin was exhumed, in line with a request from Franco's family.\n\nThe coffin was then carried out of the basilica by eight of the family members and placed into a hearse.\n\nFearing disturbances, the government banned a demonstration against the exhumation by Franco supporters at the Mingorrubio cemetery.\n\nHowever, some 400 people some waving Franco-era flags and symbols and chanting 'Viva Franco' nonetheless gathered near the cemetery while police looked on.\n\n'It's intensely symbolic for Spain,' said political scientist Pablo Simon, 'because the (Franco) monument has always been connected to those who miss the old regime.'\n\n'Exhuming the dictator's body suggests that the Valley of the Fallen's significance could be reclaimed, a normal process within democracies like ours,' Simon said.\n\nThe exhumation has been in the pipeline since 2007 when the then-Socialist government passed a 'historical memory law' which ordered Franco's remains not to be 'exalted' in a public place.\n\nThe law sought to make amends for the estimated 100,000 victims of the war and the Franco era who are buried in unmarked graves, including thousands at the Valley of the Fallen.\n\nSpain's parliament approved the exhumation in 2017, although the motion was initially ignored by the then-conservative government.\n\nBut Sanchez's Socialists have made it a priority since coming to power in June 2018 and Spain's supreme court approved it last month after dismissing a challenge from Franco's family.\n\nInitially scheduled for June 2018, the operation was delayed by more than a year due to the string of legal challenges filed by the former leader's descendants.\n\nThe government estimates the move will cost up to 63,000 euros ($70,000).\n\nAn El Mundo poll this month showed 43 per cent of Spaniards favoured the exhumation, while 32.5 per cent opposed it.\n\nOn Monday, government sources said some of the companies involved in the exhumation had received threats.\n\nOrdered by Franco in 1940 to celebrate his 'glorious crusade' against the 'godless' Republicans, construction of the Valley of the Fallen lasted for almost 20 years.\n\nThousands of dead Republicans were moved to the monument without their families' consent, while the complex itself was partially built using the forced labour of political prisoners.\n\nGeneral Secretary of the Prime Minister's office Felix Bolanos (left), Caretaker Justice Minister Dolores Delgado (centre) and the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Presidency Antonio Hidalgo Lopez (right) watch the exhumation\n\nThe coffin of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco is carried into a Super Puma helicopter for its transportation to the Mingorrubio El Pardo cemetery\n\nA helicopter carrying Franco's body flies over a stone cross which tops the mausoleum where Franco's body was laid to rest, as he is moved to a smaller burial plot\n\nThe latter include 93-year-old retired historian Nicolas Sanchez-Albornoz. 'It was time. It was overdue,' he said in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nFranco's grandson, also named Francisco Franco, arrives at the memorial near Madrid today\n\n'We've waited many decades for [Franco] to disappear from this monument, which was the shame of Spain. All the dictators of Franco's ilk have vanished from Europe - Hitler, Mussolini - and were not honoured with such tombs.'\n\nSince Franco's death in 1975, many have objected to the former dictator being buried alongside the victims of the war he started with an insurrection against the Spanish government in 1936.\n\nA staunch Catholic, he viewed the war and ensuing dictatorship as something of a religious crusade against anarchist, leftist and secular tendencies in Spain.\n\nKnown as 'El Caudillo' (The Leader), his regime left virtually isolated from political, industrial and cultural developments in Europe for nearly four decades.\n\nHowever, Franco's admirers saw him as a firm hand who fostered Spain's longest period of peace after centuries of turmoil.\n\nFar-right party Vox has capitalised on the frustrations of those supporting Franco's legacy, performing better than many expected in national elections in April.\n\nBut, as the next election looms on 10 November, Simon said he believed the left could exploit divisions over the exhumation within the moderate right-wing parties, which abstained from the parliamentary vote on the issue.\n\n'The (conservative) Partido Popular prefers not to discuss (the exhumation) because it could hurt their electoral interests,' he said.\n\n'It could spark a sort of cultural war between the PP and Vox, one of the most disputed and porous frontiers in this election.'\n\nLawyer of the Franco family Luis Felipe Utrera Molina and the Prior of the Valle de los Caidos Basilica Santiago Cantera (left), arrive for the exhumation of Franco's body.
