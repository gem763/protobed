JFK Library\n\nTwo events during the 1960s almost brought the world to an all-out war.\n\nThe first was in 1961 when 1,400 Cuban exiles were trained to overthrow the Fidel Castro's Cuban government, which had made diplomatic dealings with the USSR. The exiles were sent on their mission by President Kennedy, who had been assured by the CIA that the plan would make it seem like a Cuban uprising rather than American intervention.\n\nWhat became known as the Bay of Pigs had a disastrous outcome, with over a hundred Cuban exiles killed and the rest captured. Many Americans began bracing for war.\n\nBy 1962, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev bolstered Cuba's defenses with nuclear missiles in case the US tried invading again. The arms race between the US and the Soviet Union was already in full swing, so tensions were steadily increasing.\n\nWhen American spy planes gathered photographic evidence of these missiles, President Kennedy sent a naval blockade to \"quarantine\" Cuba, according to the JFK Presidential Library.\n\nHe also demanded removal of the missiles and total destruction of the sites that housed them. Khrushchev wasn't anxious to go to war either, so he finally agreed after extracting a promise from Kennedy that the US wouldn't invade Cuba.", "description": "Living with the constant fear that nuclear war could break out at any second was just a fact of life that everyone had to learn to do to survive.", "authors": ["Janaki Jitchotvisut"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daa05c9e94e8657cc6255dc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
