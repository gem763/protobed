But from what I have heard they were very professional about it and at the same time trying to stand up for what is right as well.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"We are fortunate in the sport we are in to not see any of that stuff happen to us. You just hope things will get better for them.\"\n\nJoseph added: \"On a personal level I am delighted that he has got his first cap. It could have been in better circumstances, but I\u2019m happy to see a mate do so well.\"\n\nDebutant Mings confirmed after the game that he first encountered racist abuse from the stands in Bulgaria during the warm-up.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"I heard it before I even got to the other side of the pitch for the warm up,\" he said. \"We then spoke about it when we came in after the warm up and, obviously, I don't need to spell it out.\n\n\"I think everybody heard the chants, but we stood together and we made certain decisions.\n\n\"Just before half-time we were contemplating coming off the pitch because that was the next step after a stadium announcement but there were a couple of minutes to go to half-time.\n\n\"So we thought we'd play the couple of minutes, go into half-time and talk about it then which we did and we made a collective decision.\n\n\"Everyone was happy to continue, everyone was happy to see if things improved in the second half and I think it was important that we allowed the correct protocol to be followed and things were better in the second half.\"", "description": "The Aston Villa defender's England debut was marred by abhorrent racist abuse from the stands in Bulgaria", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581150.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
