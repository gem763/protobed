That was a major mistake: I should have intervened, because nobody was denying, contesting the lies Boris Johnson and others were spreading around.\"\n\nBut the Commission president denied that it was the EU's fault that the campaign had been lost, instead pointing the finger at the British press.\n\n\"If for 46 years you are told day after day, and you are reading in your papers that the place of the British is not really in Europe, but that they are there for economic and internal market reasons, and all the rest \u2013 it's nonsense. bulls***, as they are saying in the European Parliament \u2013 don't be surprised if voters are asked to give their impression, some of them, a small majority but nevertheless a clear majority, is voting like a majority of the British sovereign people is voting,\" he said.\n\nMr Juncker is not the first EU leader to lambast Leave campaigners in the strongest terms. In March this year Emmanuel Macron said Brexiteers were \"anger-mongers backed by fake news\" whose \"lies and irresponsibility\" had thrown Europe into danger.\n\nBut last week the French president, who had stopped short of naming Mr Johnson in his earlier tirade, claimed he had not been taking about the prime minister, telling journalists at an EU summit: \u201cI never described Boris Johnson\" as such.\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk also angered Brexiteers after he said in February that there was a \"special place in hell\" for \"those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan\" of how to carry it out successfully.\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "Jean-Claude Juncker has accused Boris Johnson of spreading \"lies\" during the Brexit referendum campaign, in his most\u00a0strongly-worded attack\u00a0on\u00a0the prime minister yet.
