(And, for the first time, people will be able to do this online.)\n\nState, local and neighborhood groups \"have the best chance of convincing people who are wary about participating in the census that it is safe,\" Terri Ann Lowenthal, who has advised organizations and government associations on Census-related matters, tells Axios.\n\nBy the numbers: California is allocating $187 million \u2014 nearly 95 times what it did a decade ago, according to The Mercury News \u2014 far outspending every other state.\n\nNew York City has budgeted $40 million to Census outreach \u2014 the most ever \u2014 and plans to parcel it out to agencies and community-based organizations that will raise awareness about the Census.\n\nNew York state, meantime, will dedicate $20 million to Census efforts.\n\nUtah is setting aside funds for the first time ever \u2014 with a big portion of the $1 million being spent to count \"a relatively large population of children under 5,\" PBS NewsHour reports.\n\nChicago plans to spend $2.3 million \u2014 the largest amount of funding the city has ever committed to the census, per the AP.\n\nThe backstory: After a fight that escalated to the Supreme Court, the Census won't include the controversial citizenship question proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nExperts warned the question, which asked whether household members were U.S. citizens, could lead to a less accurate headcount and deprive cities with large numbers of minorities of federal funding, as Axios' Sam Baker reported.\n\nThe Census Bureau, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, has already hired thousands of temporary workers, though some fear the tight labor market could snarl its staffing plans.\n\nStates have typically created advisory councils in preparation for the Census, called \"Complete Count Commissions.\" Those groups are busier and getting more attention now than in previous years.\n\n\"We've never had a context like this,\" Beveridge says. \"That means the efforts of the Complete Count Commissions are very important this year in areas like Florida, Texas, California and New York which have high number of immigrant households.\"\n\nYes, but: Some of those states, including Florida and Texas, have taken no action at all yet. Efforts to bulk up Census outreach have failed to pass in those state's legislatures.\n\nThe bottom line: The 2020 Census is \"the single largest civilian governmental undertaking in the United States,\" according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan research group.\n\nThe states at greatest risk of an undercount, according to the Urban Institute: Florida, California, Georgia, New York, Nevada, Texas, and New Mexico.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
