That had sent the stock down about 3% in premarket trading, but shares recovered those losses after the market opened and were up 0.8% at $377.16.\n\nLockheed raised its profit estimate for 2019 by 1.9% to $21.55 per share from $21.15, the high point of a previous guidance, amid improved performance in its aeronautics business.\n\nThe Bethesda, Maryland-based company said 2020 sales would climb 5% to $62 billion from an estimated $59.1 billion at the end of 2019.\n\nThe results were \u201cimpressive\u201d and driven by better operations, while the guidance was \u201cconservative, as expected,\u201d Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note to investors.\n\nBusiness unit profit margins in 2020 were estimated to be between a range of 10.5% and 10.8%, lower than the 11.2% margin so far this year.\n\nTurkey had agreed to buy 100 stealthy F-35 jets, Lockheed's biggest program, but the Pentagon removed the NATO ally from the program and from the jet's supply chain. (Read more here)\n\nTo be sure, other countries have expressed an interest in buying the F-35, and in September, the U.S. State Department approved a proposed sale of 32 F-35 fighter jets worth as much as $6.5 billion to Poland.\n\nThe Pentagon has said the U.S. is spending between $500 million and $600 million in non-recurring engineering in order to shift the supply chain away from Turkey.\n\nThere were some operating segment wins for Lockheed during the quarter.\n\nLockheed\u2019s space unit was awarded a NASA contract worth up to $4.6 billion to build Orion astronaut capsules to help NASA build a sustainable presence on the moon. Though sales at the unit were up 5%, the 11.5% profit margin at the space unit was unchanged from last year.\n\nThe missiles and fire control unit, which makes missile defences like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), was one of its best-performing units. Sales grew 14% to $2.6 billion during the quarter.\n\nThe aeronautics division which makes the F-35 received some bad news last week when the Pentagon said it could delay its decision to move into a full-rate production of the F-35 jet by as many as 13 months, or until 2021, because of issues integrating the jet with its testing facilities.\n\nFull-rate production contracts are more lucrative for defence, and the news from the Pentagon suggests larger payments for F-35 deliveries to Lockheed from the U.S. government and its allies could be delayed by as much as a year.\n\nThe company delivered 28 F-35 combat jets in the quarter, compared with 20 a year earlier.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Lockheed delivered 29 F-35s. So far this year, the company has delivered 83 of the jets, out of a total expected for the year of 131.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nLockheed\u2019s net income rose to $1.61 billion, or $5.66 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 29, from $1.47 billion, or $5.14 per share, a year earlier.\n\nNet sales rose to $15.17 billion from $14.32 billion.\n\nLockheed\u2019s income tax rate was 9.7% in the third quarter, compared to 6.5% in the third quarter of 2018.", "description": "Lockheed Martin Corp raised its estimate for 2019 earnings on Tuesday as quarterly profit climbed 9.2% amid improved sales of its F-35 fighter jets, sending shares higher even as it forecast a lower cash flow for next year.", "authors": ["Mike Stone", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443764823&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L19O", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
