She later apologized for tweeting about the sign around the time that \"#RacistDebraMessing\" began trending on Twitter.\n\nDEBRA MESSING RESPONDS TO TRUMP TWITTER JAB WITH A CALL FOR GUN CONTROL: 'NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION'\n\n\"NUMBER 1\u2013 I apologized for liking that church sign. I said I regret it. I shud have thought before recklessly supporting,\" she tweeted Wednesday night.\n\n\"You won\u2019t accept this but black people are targeted by Trump\u2019s GOP for voter suppression,\" she added. \"Charlottesville was about Trump supporters hating POC and Jews.\"\n\nKIRSTIE ALLEY SAYS BETTE MIDLER IS A 'REAL RACIST'\n\nMessing referenced the 2017 protests in the city in opposition to removing a statue of former Civil War General Robert E. Lee; in the same weekend, white supremacists demonstrated, some screaming \"Jews will not replace us.\" James Fields plowed into counterprotesters at a white supremacist rally, killing 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer and injuring more than 30 others.\n\nKIRSTIE ALLEY, STEPHEN BALDWIN CELEBRATE TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY\n\nTrump declared after Charlottesville that \u201cthere is blame on both sides\u201d for the deadly violence, adding, \u201cThere are two sides to a story.\u201d\n\nMessing and \"Will & Grace\" co-star Eric McCormack ignited a media firestorm last week when they allegedly called for a media outlet to publish the names of people attending a fundraiser for President Trump.\n\nAmid backlash, the two claimed they weren't calling for a blacklist but rather wanted to bring attention to already-public information.\n\nDEBRA MESSING TELLS SUSAN SARANDON TO 'SHUT THE F\u2014K UP' ABOUT TRUMP\n\n\"I NEVER NOR WOULD I EVER call for a blacklist of anyone for any reason. The info is publicly available. I as a consumer want to know where MY ... Money is going when I pay for entertainment. Just as you have the right to not watch W&G bc I don\u2019t support Trump, I have the right to not go see (pay for) a movie with someone supporting babies in cages,\" the actress said in two separate tweets on Wednesday.\n\nWHOOPI GOLDBERG DISAGREES WITH DEBRA MESSING OVER TRUMP 'BLACKLIST': 'PEOPLE CAN VOTE FOR WHO THEY WANT TO'\n\nMessing also cited the First Amendment, adding that \"there is nothing threatening about asking politely for information.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trump hit back at Messing, tweeting, \"Bad 'actress' Debra The Mess Messing is in hot water. She wants to create a 'Blacklist' of Trump supporters, & is being accused of McCarthyism. Is also being accused of being a Racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"If Roseanne Barr said what she did, even being on a much higher rated show, she would have been thrown off television,\" he griped. \"Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue?
