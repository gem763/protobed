Feasts built for gathering. A long-lasting partnership that continues to evolve.\n\nINSPIRED BY the food of the French and Italian Rivieras, this dish from Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer works because of smart cooking. The chefs at Canal House Station in Milford, N.J., know that swordfish can easily dry out, so they opt for oil poaching. \u201cWhen you cook it nice and slow in olive oil, the fat gently penetrates the fish,\u201d said Ms. Hirsheimer.\n\nIn their second Slow Food Fast contribution, swordfish steaks come with a side of stuffed tomatoes. Note how the recipe neatly doubles down on the taste of tomato. You scoop out the pulp and simmer it along with short-grain rice, more garlic, a healthy pour of olive oil and some parsley. Spooned into the hollowed-out tomatoes, the filling roasts inside until the flavors concentrate. \u201cThe tomato becomes this pretty stuffed thing,\u201d said Ms. Hirsheimer. \u201cIt\u2019s a parcel, a sort of gift. And you need its acid to work against the rich fish.\u201d\n\nTOTAL TIME: 30 minutes SERVES: 4\n\n2 thick center-cut swordfish steaks (1 pound each)\n\n5\u00bd cups olive oil, plus more to finish\n\nZest of 1 lemon, removed in wide strips\n\n12 black peppercorns\n\n4 cloves garlic\n\n1 small dried red chile\n\n1 bay leaf\n\n4 medium tomatoes\n\n\u00bd cup water\n\n\u00bd cup Arborio rice\n\n\u2153 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley\n\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a medium pot, arrange fish in a single layer. Pour in enough oil to just cover, about 5 cups. Add lemon zest, peppercorns, 2 cloves garlic, chile and bay leaf. Warm over low heat so only a few small bubbles rise to the surface at a time. Gently poach fish until opaque and just cooked through, about 15 minutes.\n\n2. Meanwhile, prepare tomatoes: Slice off top quarter (stem end) of each tomato and set tops aside. Working over a large measuring cup, use a small spoon to scoop pulp from tomato bottoms, taking care not to pierce skin, leaving about \u00bc inch of wall intact. Arrange hollowed tomatoes, cut-side up, in a baking dish just big enough to fit them comfortably.\n\n3. Use a fork to roughly mash tomato pulp. Mince remaining garlic. In a small pot, combine tomato pulp and juices, minced garlic, water and rice. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until rice is al dente and sauce binding it is creamy, 10-15 minutes. Stir in remaining \u00bd cup olive oil and season with salt. If rice looks dry, stir in extra splashes of water until mixture resembles a glossy risotto. Stir in parsley and let rice rest 2-3 minutes to firm up.\n\n4. Spoon warm tomato rice into tomatoes and drizzle oil over top. Season with salt and cap tomatoes with their tops. Bake until oil starts to bubble and tomatoes\u2019 skins just split, about 15 minutes. Serve fish with warm stuffed tomatoes on the side.", "description": "Poaching low and slow in olive oil produces the most succulent and flavorful swordfish steaks you\u2019ll ever eat.", "authors": ["Kitty Greenwald"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108245/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
