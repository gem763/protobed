The latest subpoenas aim to dig into the question.\n\nEX-ENVOY TESTIFIED UKRAINE NEVER RAISED QUID PRO QUO CONCERNS WITH HIM: SOURCE\n\n\u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the Committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,\u201d the three Democratic lawmakers wrote in their letters. The Pentagon and OMB were given an Oct. 15 deadline to hand over the documents.\n\nThe subpoenas issued to the Pentagon and OMB follows a similar subpoena issued late Friday by the three lawmakers to the White House, ordering Mulvaney \u2013 now Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff \u2013 to hand over documents relating to the phone call by Oct. 18.\n\nEarlier Friday, House Democrats also sent a letter requesting documents by Oct. 15 from Vice President Mike Pence as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry is looking into whether Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election by freezing military aid, then urging Zelensky to investigate former Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the Eastern European country. Democrats have claimed that the call revealed a quid pro quo in which Trump tied the request to nearly $400 million in frozen military money.\n\nTrump has not denied that he asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens, but denies that there was any move to withhold aid to the country if prosecutors in Ukraine did not look into his 2020 election rival.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s denials, Democrats on Thursday released text messages between Andrey Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, and Kurt Volker, a former U.S. State Department special envoy to Kiev, which Democrats argue bolsters their claims against Trump.\n\nVolker, in a text message on the morning of a planned July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy, wrote: \"Heard from White House -- Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\"\n\nBut the planning started to unravel when Zelensky's aide tried to lock in a date for the Trump meeting before putting out the statement on the investigations. Trump put a hold on military assistance to the country, which was depending on the funds as part of its defense of Russian separatists.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nJust over a week after Yermak's message to Volker about funding, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, texted each other. They were discussing the White House's decision to cancel Trump's meeting with Zelensky in Poland.\n\n\"As I said over the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor wrote.\n\n\"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions,\" Sondland wrote back. \"The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelenskiy promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nSondland then recommended stopping the text exchange.\n\nFox News\u2019 Alex Pappas, Samuel Chamberlain and Edmund Demarche and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The chairmen of three powerful House committees on Monday issued subpoenas to the Pentagon and the White House Office of Management and Budget for documents relating to President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in the latest escalation of Democrats'\u00a0impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/04/694940094001_6092326053001_6092323995001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
