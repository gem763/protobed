The two things don\u2019t exist in complete isolation. Particularly in the case of Ukraine. The link between withholding the aid, the fact we have found out from this top envoy Kurt Volker yesterday that in fact, the U.S. was working to try to get the man there on the left, Ukrainian President Zelensky to sign a formal pledge that he was going to specifically investigate Biden, you know, sure creates some linkage. But you know the president is going to say there is no linkage there. I\u2019m just asking a question.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOne last point, generally speaking, if there was going to be an investigation it wouldn\u2019t be the president demanding another president do it and also talking about investigating his prime rival. It would be the FBI or the Justice Department going to law enforcement officials inside Ukraine and asking them, and that didn\u2019t happen. It was the president to the president, which raises all kinds of questions.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Friday's broadcast of Fox News Channel's \"American Newsroom,\" network anchor Chris Wallace said it raised \"all\u00a0kinds of questions\" that President Donald Trump demanded Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden's business ties. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/chris-wallace-gesture-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
