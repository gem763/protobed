Next, Jose Muniz was handed an indeterminate sentence of a minimum of 25 years for his role in Junior\u2019s slashing death. Manuel Rivera was sentenced to 23 years minimum. Antonio Santiago and Elvin Garcia were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nReports said the gangbangers stabbed Guzman-Feliz to death after they mistook him for a rival gang member. The men dragged him out of the Cruz and Chiky bodega in Belmont and proceeded to stab him with machetes and knives.\n\nVideo of the brutal slaying was caught on a surveillance camera, and prosecutors claimed that the four and a half-inch wound Martinez Estrella was seen delivering to the victim\u2019s neck was what ultimately caused his death.\n\nReports said the jury determined that Guzman-Feliz\u2019s killers also tortured the 15-year-old before viciously taking his life.\n\nTwo witnesses who testified during the trial alleged that gang boss Diego Suero told them to use whatever weapon they had to kill the teenager who was part of the New York Police Department\u2019s (NYPD) Explorers program.\n\n\u201cIf you have a gun, you shoot. If you have a knife, you stab. If you have a machete, use a machete,\u201d Suero allegedly told them.\n\nSince her son\u2019s death, the victim\u2019s mother, Leandra Feliz, has dedicated herself to making sure gang violence in her community comes to an end.\n\n\u201cMy son\u2019s not going to come back. I\u2019m not going to have my son back anymore. I do not accept any apologies because the only thing I want is my son back. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the only thing I want,\u201d she said.\n\nReports said an additional eight men who were accused of taking part in the chase that led to the teen\u2019s killing were charged with second-degree murder and are expected to appear in court later this month.", "description": "Five gangbangers were sentenced Friday after being convicted of the violent murder of Bronx teenager Lesandro \"Junior\" Guzman-Feliz in 2018.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Lesandro-\u201cJunior\u201d-Guzman-Feliz-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
