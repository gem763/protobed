The abrupt end of \u201cworking-level\u201d negotiations between U.S. and North Korean officials in Stockholm over the weekend proves yet again that talking isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cKim thought he could sucker us because of the president's statements and because our alliances are in trouble and because he believed Trump wanted a foreign policy success,\u201d said David Maxwell, retired special forces colonel and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cWe have to keep pushing Kim to really conduct negotiations, but the minute we give in to giving him concessions, he has won and we have lost.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump Shrugs, North Korea\u2019s Building Better Missiles\n\nIf the firing of the hawkish John Bolton as Trump\u2019s national security adviser \u201chelped Kim think he could get what he wants,\u201d said Maxwell, the North Koreans at Stockholm yet again confirmed that Kim is not about to give up his precious nukes. The nuclear program was initiated by his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, perpetuated by his father, Kim Jong Il, and is now the centerpiece of Kim\u2019s defense policy.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s foreign ministry left no doubt about the failure of the talks. \u201cWe have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as what happened this time,\u201d said the statement, throwing cold water over the session in Stockholm, which had lasted eight hours and thirty minutes. The U.S. negotiator, Stephen Biegun, had tried in vain to present ideas that the Americans should have known would be unacceptable.\n\nA North Korean official identified only as a spokesperson, possibly First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, who is a key figure in talks with the U.S., sarcastically mimicked Washington\u2019s demand for \u201ccomplete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.\u201d The U.S., said the spokesperson, must take \u201ca substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy toward the DPRK,\" i.e., the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\nThe statement wound up with a threat intended to catch the attention of Trump as he contemplates maybe a third summit with Kim\u2013his fourth if you count their impromptu meeting on the North-South line at Panmunjom at the end of June.\n\nBetter watch out, was the message. If the U.S. \u201cagain fingers [points] at the old scenario,\u201d said the spokesperson, \u201cthe dealings between the DPRK and the U.S. may immediately come to an end.\u201d Indeed, the statement concluded, \u201cthe fate of the future DPRK-U.S. dialogue depends on the U.S. attitude, and the end of this year is its deadline.\u201d\n\nThe Americans for their part seemed to think another round of talks would be just the thing to head off that looming deadline lest Kim inspire a crisis similar to that of two years ago when tests of nuclear warheads and long-range missiles were the norm. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the U.S. was accepting Sweden\u2019s invitation to meet again in two weeks, but North Korea was having none of it.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is spreading a completely ungrounded story that both sides are open to meet after two weeks,\u201d said the North Korean spokesperson, but \u201cit is not likely at all that it can produce a proposal commensurate to the expectations of the DPRK and to the concerns of the world in just fortnight [sic].\u201d\n\nThe statement decried the U.S. failure to come up with what the North Koreans call \u201ca new calculation method,\u201d dismissing out of hand the litany of proposals that Biegun had put on the table.\n\nThe exact nature of that \u201ccalculation method\u201d was not clear, but presumably it calls for prolonging the moratorium on testing nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles in exchange for relief from sanctions. The North might even suspend its aging nuclear complex at Yongbyon while fabricating warheads elsewhere in a step-by-step process immune from serious inspections and would surely press for an \u201cend-of-war\u201d declaration under which the U.S. would have to withdraw most of its 28,500 troops from South Korea.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problem with Trump\u2019s North Korea efforts\u2014they can\u2019t be called an actual policy\u2014is that North Korea has not even considered giving up its nuclear weapons,\u201d said David Straub, retired senior U.S. diplomat in Seoul and Washington. \u201cAs long as that\u2019s the case, no amount of Trump sucking up to Kim will make a real difference, and Trump backed off maximum pressure long ago.\u201d", "description": "Alex Wong/GettyIf President Donald Trump is thinking a deal with his friend Kim Jong Un might distract from his troubles at home, he'd better think again.
