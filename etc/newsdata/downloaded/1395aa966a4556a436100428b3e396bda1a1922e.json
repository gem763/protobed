Titled JUDY The Original Soundtrack, the album also comes out out September 27th via Republic & Decca Records.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 17 years old, I did a project on Judy Garland for my Film Studies A-Level,\u201d Smith shared in a statement. \u201cI was immediately immersed into the magic of Judy and her incredibly brave and triumphant story. She has remained as one of the icons of my life. She was one of the bravest humans out there and her vulnerability and honesty in her art still gives me goose bumps like it did the first time. It was truly an honor to sing with Ren\u00e9e. Nobody could have played Judy as well as Ren\u00e9e, and it is a career highlight for me to be singing with her, and in some small way, with Judy. I hope everyone loves the film as much as I did.\u201d \u200b\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nThe soundtrack features Zellweger covering several other iconic Garland songs, including \u201cFor Once in My Life,\u201d \u201cCome Rain or Come Shine\u201d and \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d It also includes a collaboration with Rufus Wainwright, who sings with Zellweger on holiday classic \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\u201d\n\nJudy, directed by Rupert Goold, centers on the actress and singer in the year before she died at the age of 47 as she undertakes a string of concerts at London\u2019s Talk of the Town. The film also stars Jessie Buckley, Rufus Sewell, Finn Wittrock and Michael Gambon.\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
