REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nThe clashes in the Causeway Bay shopping district followed another night of violent showdowns with police after weeks of pro-democracy unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.\n\nSome shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service said it would cut some services.\n\nProtesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for their \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d of the government, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.\n\nAbout 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour, at around midday. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted \u201cI love China\u201d.\n\nAngela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were \u201cthugs\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the government takes violent action I don\u2019t object,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it\u2019s not safe to go out.\u201d\n\nLam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic the following day.\n\nLam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an \u201copen dialogue\u201d with the people, will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night overland, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target of anti-government protests.\n\nLam had sent out invitations \u201crequesting the pleasure of your company\u201d at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.\n\nPolice fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nAnti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing\u2019s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalised metro stations and set street fires in the former British colony.\n\nPolice have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\nProtests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired tear gas to break up pro-democracy protesters on Sunday as the government announced the city's leader Carrie Lam will be out of town for China's Oct. 1 National Day, despite her sending out invitations for celebrations at home.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435069837&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S02F", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
