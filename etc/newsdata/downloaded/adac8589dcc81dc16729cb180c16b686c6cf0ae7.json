But those first three things give him a chance to move forward.\"\n\nJones gave a reason for hope for the Giants and Giants fans. One of his better throws of the day came in the third quarter, when he hit Sterling Shepard in the end zone, squeezing the ball in a tight window for his second passing touchdown of the day.\n\nWith 3:16 left in the fourth quarter and the Giants trailing by six, Jones took over and led the team downfield and into the red zone. On 4th-and-5, the game on the line, Jones stepped up through the pocket and ran in the game-winning touchdown.\n\nThe Giants got lucky when Buccaneers kicker Matt Gay missed the game-winning, 34-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nShepard may have offered the best praise of the day, saying they couldn't tell Jones was a rookie quarterback making his first start.\n\n\"He plays with so much poise. You really can't tell he's a rookie,\" Shepard said. \"I've heard a lot of stuff about rookies in their first game and how it doesn't turn out too well. I don't think that's the case with him.\"", "description": "Daniel Jones is normally mild-mannered, but his fiery, competitive side came out in the second quarter of the Giants win over the Bucs.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88da592e22af0d865b7e05-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
