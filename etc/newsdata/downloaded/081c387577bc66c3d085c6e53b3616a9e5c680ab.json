She seemed very happy about it.\n\n'I was wrong. I thought that she would be grateful [sic] for the free advertising but when the check came there was literally no discount at all.\n\n'I thought at least one of the entries would be taken off but they didn't even take off the calamari or even the drinks!\n\n'I won't got back here because of this. Which is a shame because the food was very good. The manager needs to understand how to treat customers.'\n\nHer review was posted to subreddit r/ChoosingBeggars where she was mocked for her pettiness.\n\nHowever, Reddit users had not sympathy for her complaints.\n\n'If I was the owner, I'd frame this review and put it in the entryway' one wrote.\n\n'It literally says \"best Italian food I've ever eaten\". Highlight that s***, another wrote'.\n\n'THIS!! The perfect review' a third penned. 'It praises the food from the restaurant and the criticism only serves to expose the pettiness of the reviewer'.\n\nOthers pointed out how it was great publicity for the restaurant, and they should display the sign.\n\n'Some of the best Italian food I've had' - her name' wrote one.\n\n'There's a restaurant in San Diego that has a really long hallway to the bathroom where they place voice recordings of bad reviews' another said.\n\nA third added: 'Food best I ever had. Service fabulous'.", "description": "The anonymous user, believed to be from the US, left a one-star Yelp review because the management didn't discount her meal when she mentioned posting to her 11,000 Instagram fans.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/12/20278294-0-image-a-10_1572265804356.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
