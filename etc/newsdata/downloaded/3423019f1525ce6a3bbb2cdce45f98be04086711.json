REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - A Paris zoo showcased a mysterious new organism on Wednesday, dubbed the \u201cblob\u201d, a yellowish unicellular small living being which looks like a fungus but acts like an animal.\n\nThis newest exhibit of the Paris Zoological Park, which goes on display to the public on Saturday, has no mouth, no stomach, no eyes, yet it can detect food and digest it.\n\nThe blob also has almost 720 sexes, can move without legs or wings and heals itself in two minutes if cut in half.\n\n\u201cThe blob is a living being which belongs to one of nature\u2019s mysteries\u201d, said Bruno David, director of the Paris Museum of Natural History, of which the Zoological Park is part.\n\n\u201cIt surprises us because it has no brain but is able to learn (...) and if you merge two blobs, the one that has learned will transmit its knowledge to the other,\u201d David added.\n\nThe blob was named after a 1958 science-fiction horror B-movie, starring a young Steve McQueen, in which an alien life form - The Blob - consumes everything in its path in a small Pennsylvania town.\n\n\u201cWe know for sure it is not a plant but we don\u2019t really if it\u2019s an animal or a fungus,\u201d said David.\n\n\u201cIt behaves very surprisingly for something that looks like a mushroom (...) it has the behavior of an animal, it is able to learn.\u201d", "description": "A Paris zoo showcased a mysterious new organism on Wednesday, dubbed the \"blob\", a yellowish unicellular small living being which looks like a fungus but acts like an animal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441549802&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1L8", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
