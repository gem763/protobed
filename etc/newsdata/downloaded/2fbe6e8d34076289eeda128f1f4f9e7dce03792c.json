(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nIn a town hall filmed inside New York\u2019s Sing Sing prison that aired Sunday night, \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt dissected the costs of America\u2019s high rates of incarceration. Joined by singer John Legend, Holt asked prisoners about the toll on their families and their ideas for changing the system.\n\nOne topic, though, did not come up: The bipartisan criminal justice reform bill signed by President Trump in December. And the White House\u2019s chief media critic noticed.\n\nIn a four-tweet flurry sent late on Sunday, Trump lashed out at Holt and \u201cboring musician\u201d Legend \u2014 while also swiping at Legend\u2019s \u201cfilthy mouthed wife,\u201d model and frequent Trump critic Chrissy Teigen \u2014 for not giving him personal credit for his efforts.\n\n\u201cI SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to the First Step Act, which reduced federal drug sentences among other measures. \u201cBut now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s and Biden\u2019s dueling claims on criminal justice reform]\n\nLegend, a Grammy and Oscar-winning singer who also founded FreeAmerica, a criminal justice reform advocacy group, suggested the president\u2019s ire was misplaced.\n\nImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody--ANYBODY--will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nTeigen, meanwhile, hit back at Trump with an expletive and wrote that \u201cthe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn\u2019t speak in the special, nor was I mentioned.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s voracious TV-watching habits are well documented, as is his zeal to bash coverage he dislikes. But his Sunday tirade is unusual because Trump wasn\u2019t mentioned or criticized during the town hall. In fact, in \u201cJustice For All,\u201d Holt\u2019s special that re-aired just before the town hall on MSNBC, the anchor did show footage of Trump signing the First Step Act, and reported that it would reduce sentences for many in federal detention. Holt added, however, that the bill \u201cwouldn\u2019t affect more than 90 percent of the U.S. prison population, which is locked up in state and local facilities.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Everyone tunes in\u2019: Inside Trump\u2019s obsession with cable TV]\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about not getting credit for the First Step Act, a rare bipartisan accomplishment for his administration. In August, he fumed, \u201cI did criminal justice reform, which President Obama could not get approved, which the media never talks about\u201d \u2014 a claim The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker ruled as doubly false, noting that The Post and other major newspapers ran front-page stories about the First Step Act and that Obama had earlier reduced other drug sentences in federal prisons.\n\nTrump sounded a similar theme again on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cWhen all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn\u2019t come close....\u201d\n\nThe president also suggested that his political opponents were now claiming credit for the work while attacking him.\n\n\u201cGuys like boring ... musician @johnlegend and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\u201d he tweeted. \u201c'Anchor' @LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about \u2026 the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it ... And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump!\u201d\n\nHolt\u2019s town hall grew out of his reporting on endemic problems in the justice system, particularly on the state level. Holt spent two nights locked up in the infamous Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as \u201cAngola,\u201d for \u201cJustice For All,\u201d which first aired Friday night on \u201cDateline.\u201d\n\n[NBC\u2019s Lester Holt spends 2 nights in prison for news show]\n\nSunday\u2019s moderated town hall offered a chance to discuss his findings with prisoners inside Sing Sing. Legend, whose advocacy group has focused on state level reform in places like Louisiana, noted the negative effect of high prison rates on millions of children and urged Americans to see the \u201chumanity\u201d of those impacted.\n\n\u201cEvery dollar we spend on prisons, every dollar we spend on punishment, it\u2019s dollars we can\u2019t spend on education, health care, on the things that make our communities stronger,\u201d Legend said.", "description": "President Trump lashed out over an MSBNC town hall on criminal justice reform that didn't discuss the White House's efforts that passed earlier this year.", "authors": ["Tim Elfrink", "Editor Of The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Tim Elfrink Joined The Washington Post In He'S The Editor Of Morning Mix."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WOh9ddP6Er6jjiMpD-vd7wofaWU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTXLRIGSXII6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
