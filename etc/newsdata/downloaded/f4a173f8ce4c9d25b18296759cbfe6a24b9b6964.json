But in some of his bluntest remarks dismissing the possibility of a high-profile meeting between Tehran and Washington, Iran\u2019s president Hassan Rouhani ruled out any direct talks with the White House.\n\nMr Trump and Mr Rouhani last week suggested they were open to such talks. But in a speech on Tuesday, Mr Rouhani said any negotiations with the US would only be possible with other world powers and only after the US lifts \u201call\u201d sanctions on Iran imposed since Mr Trump last year pulled out of the JCPOA, the landmark nuclear signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\n\"The issue of bilateral talks is not on the agenda in principle,\" Mr Rouhani told parliament. \u201cWe have no plans for bilateral talks with America and have never had.\"\n\nIt was unclear whether Mr Kamalvandi was suggesting Iran was pondering a move boost its small stockpile of 20 per cent enriched uranium as a response to the US sanctions, whether he was showing off about Iran\u2019s technical capabilities, or leaving just enough ambiguity to put pressure on European countries seeking to come up with a scheme that would prevent Iran from making any drastic moves.\n\nTehran has already increased its stockpile of enriched uranium and boosted its level of enrichment as a response to US sanctions which have crippled Iran\u2019s ability to sell its oil.\n\nMr Macron has spent hours this week speaking to Mr Rouhani on the phone, and reports suggest he is offering Iran $15 billion in credits in exchange for its full compliance with the JCPOA, which gave Iran economic incentives to place limits on its nuclear programme.\n\nRead more\n\nIranians barely hanging on brace for impact of new US sanctions\n\n\"Today the essence of our talks with the European countries is this that if they purchase our oil for cash or credit, or make advance purchases and let us access the money for it, this will make conditions easier for us to halt the steps for rolling back our commitments for as long as such conditions are in place,\u201d said Mr Rouhani.\n\nEven if Iran escalates its nuclear programme on Thursday, Mr Rouhani said it would it still be open to talks with the remaining JCPOA partners: including the UK, Russia, Germany, France, and China.\n\nBut Mr Rouhani insisted that his earlier remarks saying he was open to talks with the US had been misunderstood.", "description": "Iran has suggested it could boost its enrichment of uranium to 20 per cent purity, a level that alarms nuclear arms specialists because it is considered a relatively easy jump to weapons-grade material.\"If Iran decides, it can have 20 per cent enriched fuel within one to two days,\" the Fars", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U4TwcTc0SMx9If0C9T1I.w--~B/aD0zODg7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/720cadab1e1d174f742d082b7fcc6c3b"}
