For many swimmers, the view is that it is long overdue.\n\nTaking the form of a fast-paced, team-competition over short-course metres, the league, bankrolled by billionaire businessman Konstantin Grigorishin, offers them the chance to compete regularly outside of the Olympic Games, as well as receive healthy financial incentives and year-round recognition.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for the next generation of swimmers, both financially and competitively - it provides racing opportunities that are not otherwise there,\u201d says Coughlin.", "description": "If there is an element of the unknown this weekend for Natalie Coughlin when she races competitively in a pool for the first time in over three years, then of one thing the 12-time Olympic medallist - to women's swimming in the 2000s what Michael Phelps was to men's - is more than certain about.", "authors": ["Pippa Field", "Daniel Schofield", "Jonathan Kaplan", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/swimming/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000003559122-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_FRufxlXlFdg3aWYkgPkWIWr_u455mf8BwuUElDbEOs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
