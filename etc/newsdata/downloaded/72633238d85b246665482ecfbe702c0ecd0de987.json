'The players and everyone at the club, here at the training ground, hurts.\n\n'Me, even more, because I'm a Manchester United fan and a player and I am here at the Aon Training Complex every day. It hurts not getting the results.\n\n'Everybody is doing their best to get it turned around and I am sure it will happen.\n\n'Everyone is working hard, even harder, and, sooner or later, when everyone is working hard, things get back to good ways.\n\n'It's a perfect game against Liverpool, a perfect derby, and we have to build up for it.'\n\nPereira was born in Belgium and plays for Brazil, but he was reared in the United academy and knows how important beating Liverpool is for everyone connected to the club.\n\nUnited have been struggling this season and the midfielder admitted that 'everyone is hurting'\n\n'I think you can compare it with Boca Juniors-River Plate, Santos-Corinthians, Flamengo-Fluminense,' he told United Review.\n\n'It's one of the biggest derbies like El Clasico - Real Madrid versus Barcelona - and one of the biggest games, not only in England but in the world.\n\n'Everyone will be watching and it's most important for us, and for the fans.\n\n'I always watched these games at home with my dad and my family. You know, I was always very curious and supporting United.\n\n'I think it means a lot to us. It's one of the most important games of the year - it's the derby and we absolutely want to win this game.\n\n'We will do absolutely everything to win it. I know we're not living the best moment right now, and we're not getting results, but I think it's a derby and it is always a different game.\n\n'Absolutely, we want to win it - everyone at the club, everyone in the team and the staff.\n\n'We all want to do everything to win the game and it can be a nice bounce back and provide a nice lift for us to start getting results.'", "description": "Manchester United have had a lot of soul-searching to do over the international break after the shock loss at embattled Newcastle left them just two points off the Premier League relegation zone.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19921532-0-image-a-27_1571486736103.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
