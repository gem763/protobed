Do you think it's important, as Chairman Rodgers just suggested, to keep up the tempo, for U.S. forces to stay in the region to make sure that this doesn't become a remember the main kind of call for these terrorists?\" host Jake Tapper asked.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. I think Chairman Rodgers is exactly right. ISIS is more than just Baghdadi, as important as he was. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 14,000 to 18,000 fighters yet remaining and, of course, the franchises are branches in other places, notably, Afghanistan where, of course, we still have forces,\" Clapper said. \"ISIS did anticipate losing leadership and so they decentralized and groomed people to assume the role. Now I don\u2019t know that they have anybody that would have the symbolic importance of Baghdadi, but I don\u2019t think we can say at this point that we can stop worrying about ISIS.\u201d", "description": "Oh..10/27/2019 20:22:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/134/fdb22c83-7cdf-48f1-8f34-180aa5024ea7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
