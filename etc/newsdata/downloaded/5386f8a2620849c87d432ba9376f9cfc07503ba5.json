Kirsty then painted MDF numbers into Disney Characters, used a stamp cutter in the shape of Mickey\u2019s head to make table confetti out of sparkly wallpaper, painted a stand of Ferrero Rocher in Mickey Mouse colours, made a Mickey and Minnie shaped cake topper to match the Disney cake, and gave out favours of candles with a Mickey and Minnie motif on, plus sweet packets with Kirsty\u2019s own made labels.\n\nOn the morning of the wedding Kirsty wore \u2018just married\u2019 Disney pyjamas, while the best man enjoyed his custom decorated Disney hipflask.\n\nKirsty also made a Disney chalkboard, Disney coat hangers, a Disney seating plan and a post box insert too.\n\nKirsty designed every detail, including this Mickey Mouse Ferrero Rocher stand (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\nKirsty printed Mickey and Minnie on champagne glasses (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\nShe made the cake topper herself (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\nDuring the wedding breakfast the bride walked down the aisle to Can You Feel The Love tonight from The Lion King.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actual wedding outfits weren\u2019t too in-your-face with the Disney references. Simon wore cufflinks shaped like Mickey with his \u00a3300 grey suit, while Kirsty wore a classic white dress she bought and had altered for a total of \u00a3900.\n\nThe photographer cost \u00a31,500, the cake was \u00a3400, the venue, food, and registrar cost \u00a38,000, the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses were \u00a3300, the wedding rings were \u00a31,000, makeup was \u00a3350, and Kirsty\u2019s hair stylist cost \u00a3250.\n\nThe bride walked down the aisle to Can You Feel The Love Tonight (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\nSimon wore Mickey Mouse cufflinks (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\n\u2018We planned everything on spreadsheets,\u2019 said Kirsty. \u2018This tracked saving, budget, deposits and also an itinerary of what needed to be done when. It went perfectly.\n\n\u2018I found it very hard to find anything Disney for the wedding which wasn\u2019t very expensive, so I decided to try and do it myself.\n\n\u2018My favourite moment was arriving at the venue and listening to the orchestral Disney songs playing. It took me right back to Disney when we got engaged and that\u2019s when it became real.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want loads of \u2018in your face\u2019 stuff so I knew by doing it myself I could take something classic and put a hint of Disney into it.\n\nRoses were arranged in the shape of Mickey and Minnie Mouse heads (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\nThe seating plan (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\nEach table number was painted to theme (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\nKirsty even made a custom postbox insert (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcus Charter Pho)\n\n\u2018I used Pinterest and thought about creative ways to include Disney on a classy scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We had a small wedding of sixty guests; they knew it was Disney themed as soon as they saw the invites.\n\n\u2018What I love about Disney the most is that anyone of any age can fall in love with Disney. You\u2019re never too old or too young and when you hear the music and see the castle, the feelings you have inside are just magical. It\u2019s like a whole new world.\n\n\u2018Simon knew my dream was to be married in Disney, but we couldn\u2019t have only half the family come with us, so he was 100% behind bringing Disney to the wedding in the UK.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s proud of me making everything because I put so much effort in and it made our wedding unique to us.\u2019\n\nMORE: Bride heartbroken when peacock wedding cake she ordered looks like a \u2018lopsided turkey with leprosy\u2019\n\nMORE: Biker stops wedding car and begs his ex not to get married\n\nMORE: Couple get married in a hospital room after the groom is rushed into brain surgery on their wedding day\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Kirsty has always been obsessed with Disney films, and when her partner Simon popped the question at Disney World, she set to work.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89377119_1570776379.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
