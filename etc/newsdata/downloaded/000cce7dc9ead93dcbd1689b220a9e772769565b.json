Of them, one managed to par the hole, while another bogeyed it.\n\nEight others teed off at another makeshift course in Syangboche, located at an altitude of 3,880 metres (12,730 feet), overlooking Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks.\n\n\u201cAlthough it was not a great, complete golf course but the very fact that they could organise even one-hole golf at that altitude of almost 4,000 metres was fun,\u201d said Bhagwan Koirala, a player.\n\nPreviously, the highest golf had been played at was at an altitude of 3,960 metres (12,992 feet) in Sikkim, said Prateek Pradhan of the organising group.\n\nThe remainder of the tournament will be played in Kathmandu at the weekend.", "description": "A high-altitude golf tournament in the shadow of Nepal's Mount Everest had to be called off over the weekend as most of the players could not fly in due to heavy cloud cover, its organiser said on Monday, though a few golfers managed a quick game.", "authors": ["Gopal Sharma", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
