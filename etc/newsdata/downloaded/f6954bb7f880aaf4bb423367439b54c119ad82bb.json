The financier also pleaded guilty to just two prostitution charges, though the Daily Mail reports that because one of the charges Epstein plead guilty to was for recommitting an offense, he had three felony convictions.\n\n\"I understand Mr. Epstein would be ineligible for participation in the work release program if he committed three violations of F.S.S. 796 within the past five years,\" Assistant US Attorney Marie Villafana wrote in a letter sent on December 11, 2008, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nVillafana also reportedly noted that he had created his work release company just days before he was sentenced and that his New York-based attorney doesn't seem to be an ideal choice to enforce the sheriff's office guidelines of a supervisor for Epstein's activity during his release.\n\nRead more: Jeffrey Epstein enjoyed unprecedented freedom during his 13-month jail term, but nobody will say why\n\nShe closed out by saying that decision was not for her office to make, and that she just wanted to pass along the information\n\nThe Daily Mail noted that the letter ends with Villafana saying the decision is up to the sheriff's office, as she just \"wanted to make sure that you had a complete picture before you made that decision.\"\n\nThe work release part of the deal stipulated that Epstein left jail to work in his private office 12 hours a day, six days a week, and would then be returned to a private wing of the Palm Beach County jail, which has been described by the Palm Beach Post as being for \"snitches or others who need protection from other inmates for various reasons, such as having a lot of money.\"\n\nAfter Epstein's release and mounting investigation into the shocking allegations against him, it was unclear how the disgraced financier's entry into the work-release program was approved by the courts with no objections by the state.\n\nA November 2018 Miami Herald report probed the deal that granted Epstein lax sentencing guidelines even though the paper said local and federal investigators looking into Epstein's suspected trafficking of minor girls had enough evidence to put him away for life in 2007.\n\nPBSO spokeswoman Therese Barbera told local channel WPTV that the timing of Epstein's registering as a sex offender was what allowed for his release, which was also noted in the Daily Mail report.\n\n\"Sex offenders are not allowed to go on work release,\" Barbera said, echoing some findings of the Herald's 2018 report. \"Epstein registered as a sex offender after he was released from jail,\" she told the Florida channel.\n\nThe arrangement raised a bevy of new concerns when a lawyer representing some of the women who have accused Epstein of sexual abuse said in July 2019 that Epstein committed sexual abuse during his release when he hosted underage female visitors at his private office.\n\nEpstein was arrested on July 6, 2019, and plead not guilty to sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls, allegations for which dated back to the early 2000s, the majority of which purportedly took place in his Florida and New York residences.\n\nEpstein later died by suicide on August 10 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges, leaving the next steps for his victims seeking justice unclear.\n\nRead more:\n\nJeffrey Epstein told a journalist he funded Sophia the robot, who he claimed would have 'more empathy than a woman'\n\nHarvard accepted over $8 million in donations from Jeffrey Epstein.
