A statement from U.S. Embassy noted that \u201cimmunity is rarely waived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the amount of diplomats we have in the U.K., we can\u2019t have someone go out and do something like that again and leave another family to suffer,\u201d Charlotte said in an interview with BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.\n\nThe parents also said during the interview that they had heard \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d from the Sacoolas family since the fatal collision near the Royal Air Force Croughton station, which is operated by the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\u201cAs a mother myself, it\u2019s really distressing not to have any word from her [Sacoolas]. It doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d Charlotte said.\n\n\u201cThe whole family desperately want to grieve but we can\u2019t, so every day is a battle,\u201d she added, while revealing that Harry had a twin brother, who has now \u201clost his twin-ship and his partner in crime.\u201d\n\nThe teenager\u2019s death has sparked widespread outrage on British soil and, in recent days, has garnered international interest, with Dunn\u2019s parents receiving condolences and supportive messages from many around the world.\n\n\u201cThe messages of support we\u2019ve had from the U.S. have been immense. They\u2019re all appalled and devastated for us and disgusted that this woman has been allowed to leave the U.K.,\u201d Charlotte said.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to see it through, we won\u2019t stop. We will go to Washington if we have to,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMaybe President Trump will look at this and hopefully look in our favor,\u201d Tim, the father, added.\n\nJohnson said on Monday that he hoped Sacoolas would return to Britain and \u201cengage properly with the processes of law\u201d while adding that he was willing to raise Dunn\u2019s case \u201cpersonally with the White House,\u201d if necessary.\n\n\"The whole family desperately want to grieve but we can't, so every day is a battle.\"\n\nHarry Dunn's mum tells #BBCBreakfast the fight for justice for her son is delaying their grief.\n\n\n\nMore here: https://t.co/Xg6qyl8YTt pic.twitter.com/tPZTMVBbdu \u2014 BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) October 8, 2019\n\nIn a tweet on Tuesday, U.S. ambassador to the Britain, Woody Johnson, said that British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and his U.S. counterpart, Mike Pompeo, had \u201cdiscussed the tragic death of a British citizen in a traffic accident on August 27 near Croughton\u201d on Monday. \u201cWe once again express our condolences to the friends and family of Harry Dunn.\u201d\n\nWhile Sacoolas was named in British media reports and by the prime minister as the suspect driving the vehicle that knocked the 19-year-old off his motorcycle, the State Department declined to confirm her or her husband\u2019s identity on Monday.\n\nFamily members of diplomats living in other countries are covered by immunity, under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. In most circumstances, this allows them to avoid arrest for virtually any crime. A country can also waive their diplomats immunity if it so chooses.\n\nOn Tuesday Dunn\u2019s parents described him as a \u201cbig-hearted\u201d person and \u201cpassionate\u201d biker who \u201clived to ride.\u201d", "description": "\"We will go to Washington if we have to,\u201d Dunn's parents vowed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SDuA-skg5JD5m_WK3KCfGOqCJHI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IT5G52EXGVFSZEAWJL4GNDB37E.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
