Show Hide The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.\n\nThe investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\n\nRystad bases its work on companies\u2019 assets and a long-term oil price of $65 a barrel, similar to its current level.\n\nThe forecast shows an almost 8% rise in the projected output of the top 50 oil and gas companies between 2018 and 2030, which would account for almost two-fifths of the remaining 1.5C carbon budget and increase the risk of heatwaves, hurricanes, forest fires and floods.\n\nAt least 14 of the 20 biggest historical carbon producers plan to pump out more hydrocarbons in 2030 than in 2018, according to the Rystad data.\n\nIts analysis shows the US is the centre of the latest global oil boom, with more than four times more new production than the next country, Canada, over the next 10 years.\n\nThe expansion will primarily be in the Permian basin in Texas. BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips will be involved, as well as smaller, faster-growing private firms that are together driving this single US state to produce more oil and gas than all of Saudi Arabia by 2030.\n\nMassive new drilling projects are also under way or planned in north-west Argentina, off the Caribbean shores of Guyana, in Kazakhstan\u2019s Kashagan oilfield, in the Yamal peninsula in Siberia and in the Barents Sea.\n\nLorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at Oil Change International, which monitors oil companies, said: \u201cRather than planning an orderly decline in production, they are doubling down and acting like there is no climate crisis. This presents us with a simple choice: shut them down or face extreme climate disruption.\u201d\n\nContact the Guardian securely Read more\n\nRichard Heede, a researcher at the Climate Accountability Institute in the US, said the companies would be putting themselves \u2013 and human civilisation \u2013 at risk, unless they shifted to renewable energy and offset new production to net zero by mid-century.\n\n\u201cNo company that values its social licence to operate shall make a capital investment in new fossil fuel projects without offsetting or sequestering an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide so as to assure alignment with science-based targets to 1.5C and net zero emissions by 2050,\u201d he added.\n\nSeparately, the watchdog group Global Witness estimates companies plan to invest $4.9tn in new fields \u2013 none of which are compatible with the 1.5C target.\n\nDieter Helm, an Oxford University academic and government adviser, said oil giants were planning a final fossil fuel \u201charvest\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we were serious about addressing climate change we would leave some oil in the ground, so there is a scramble among big oil companies to make sure their assets are not the ones left stranded,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTheir answer is to pump as much as they can, while they still can, to keep delivering shareholder dividends. But the problem for the rest of us is that they are going to produce far more oil and gas than is consistent with the Paris agreement.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 3:46 Why we need political action to tackle the oil, coal and gas companies - video explainer\n\nAmong publicly traded companies, Shell is forecast to increase output by 38% by 2030, by increasing its crude oil production by more than half and its gas production by over a quarter.\n\nThe company\u2019s forecast trajectory shows it will overtake today\u2019s biggest international oil company, ExxonMobil, by 2025, according to Rystad.\n\nShell said it did not disclose future production plans but it was on course to sustain output to meet demand, which required continued investment.\n\nThe company has been lauded for its environmental leadership among its big oil peers, owing to its vocal support of the Paris climate agreement, carbon intensity targets \u2013 mainly through more emphasis on gas than oil \u2013 and forays into low-carbon projects.\n\nBen van Beurden, the chief executive, has called climate change the biggest issue facing the oil industry. The company plans to expand into renewables but just $1bn-$2bn of its annual $25bn-$30bn capital expenditure is allocated for low-carbon projects, a figure it hopes to double.\n\n\u201cWe believe \u2026 it is our role to make sure we make energy available with a lower carbon footprint, so that we help whether it is the aviation sector, the residential sector, the steel sector or the petrochemical sector to curtail and contain their greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI believe philosophically \u2013 and I know this is a tough sell because there is a fringe that is in a different camp on this \u2013 that it is not for energy companies to curtail the use of energy.\u201d\n\nState-owned Qatar Petroleum is the only company planning a bigger increase, of 58% by 2030.\n\nShell is not alone among international companies planning to pump much more oil and gas, according to the research. The US firm ExxonMobil is expected to increase its fossil fuel production by 35% by 2030, BP by 20% and France\u2019s Total by 12%.\n\nEspen Erlingsen, an analyst at Rystad, said: \u201cAmong the majors, we see the largest growth potential coming from Shell. Here deepwater, shale gas and tight oil projects are driving the potential production growth.\u201d But he said Shell had sold some of its most carbon-intensive assets, such as Canadian tar sands fields.\n\nNone of the top 20 companies disputed the projections.\n\nAn ExxonMobil spokesperson said: \u201cWe believe climate change is a serious issue and it is going to take efforts by business, governments and consumers to make meaningful action. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions.\u201d\n\nHalf a century of dither and denial \u2013 a climate crisis timeline Read more\n\nOther companies said they were investing in renewables or focusing on gas. Total said it was increasing the efficiency of its facilities but was not responsible for how its products were used by consumers. More details about their responses can be found here.\n\nIn absolute terms, the international oil companies will still be dwarfed by the output of state-run national firms in the future. The biggest, Saudi Aramco, will continue to suck the most fossil fuels out of the ground.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2030, it plans to produce oil and gas equivalent to 27bn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 almost all of which will eventually make its way into the atmosphere and add to the problem of global heating. This is followed by Gazprom, the Iranian National Oil Co, ExxonMobil, Russia\u2019s Rosneft, Shell, PetroChina and BP.\n\nThe top 50 firms will together produce the equivalent of 225bn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide over this 12-year period, notes a separate analysis by Oil Change International: 38.8% of the 1.5C carbon budget.\n\nSome of the few projected declines are in Algeria, Mexico and Venezuela, though forecasts for the state-owned corporations in these countries are considered less reliable.", "description": "Projected production surge in next 12 years to be led by Shell despite climate crisis", "authors": ["Jonathan Watts", "Jillian Ambrose", "Adam Vaughan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/773d7ff10ddfee0cbb57a008621462ae19bb8737/0_0_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7ad54c9f8fc9d40a7c06d647c8a55b2", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
