The plan is to hand out \u00a3465million for the current financial year.\n\nChief executive John Foley sees sustainable growing dividends as a core part of his strategy.\n\nHe believes that M&G will fare better once it is independent of the shackles of the Prudential empire.\n\nThe feeling is that M&G failed to unlock its full potential during its 20 years of being owned by the Pru, and that it will do better once it is not bogged down in the bureaucracy of a much larger group.\n\nIt is looking to expand in Europe and also in the US and Asia, which it was not able to do in its own right under the Pru umbrella.\n\nNonetheless, it is likely to have a volatile debut. There is Brexit, of course. And worries over trade wars between the US and China \u2013 and now the EU \u2013 are denting investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nFund manager M&G could hardly have picked a trickier time to spin off from its parent company, the Prudential, writes Ruth Sunderland\n\nM&G is also being saddled with a hefty chunk of debt \u2013 \u00a33.2billion \u2013 by the Prudential in the demerger.\n\nIt also has a large closed book of policies that are no longer sold. Although its long-term track record is strong, there are a few question marks over recent numbers.\n\nProfits were down by 12 per cent in the first half of this year to just under \u00a3240million. As for the funds, one of the best-known, M&G Recovery, is in need of a bit of recovery itself having dropped 10 per cent in the year to the end of September.\n\nThe Optimal Income Fund, run by Richard Woolnough, has also been lacklustre in its recent returns.\n\nThis is despite the fact Woolnough has taken home some gargantuan pay packets. He received around \u00a333million in the two years of 2013 and 2014 and is still thought to be taking home enormous amounts. We don\u2019t know how much since his rewards are not disclosed.\n\nAs a standalone company, M&G needs to be whiter than white on corporate governance.\n\nIt cannot credibly lecture the companies in which it invests if it doles out vast sums to its own managers, particularly if their performance doesn\u2019t match up.\n\nThe plus side is that it has a strong brand and is well placed to benefit from ageing societies where people need to provide for themselves and are looking for better returns than those available on cash savings.\n\nAs an independent entity, M&G could become a much-needed positive force to encourage long-term saving.\n\nFreed of the shackles of the Pru, it could take an activist role on corporate governance as it will be able to speak out on obscene pay and other abuses much more publicly than has been the case.\n\nThere is also a golden opportunity to channel capital into infrastructure and green technology to combat climate change.\n\nIf M&G gets it right, this is a chance to restore some of the trust squandered in the Neil Woodford debacle.\n\nAfter that disaster, the rest of the industry needs to work harder than ever to win back disillusioned savers.", "description": "Fund manager M&G is making its debut on the stock market today as an independent entity, in the thick of Brexit uncertainty, not to mention the pall cast by the Neil Woodford scandal.", "authors": ["Ruth Sunderland For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
