It was a mighty roar of resentment over the way they had been treated.\n\nThe Coalfields Regeneration Trust now proposes a five-year strategic plan, involving a \u00a340million investment to create 1,000 private-sector jobs in former pit areas.\n\nMost of the money would come from the Government \u2013 peanuts in terms of public spending.\n\nThe CRT, a self-funded charity since the Tories withdrew support, has an excellent track record. Over the last 20 years, it has helped create jobs for 30,000 people or got them into work, and upskilled more than a million.\n\nIts programme to build new industrial and commercial property for growing \u00adbusinesses is properly costed and would deliver huge social return as well as work.\n\nThe coal industry once covered large parts of central Scotland, the North East, \u00adYorkshire, Lancashire, Notts, the Midlands, South Wales and reached as far south as Kent \u2013 a combined population of 5.7 million. That\u2019s probably a hundred parliamentary constituencies.\n\nIn the coming election, every candidate from every party should be asked to sign up for this regeneration programme.\n\nThose who don\u2019t are not fit to represent the people.\n\nBy the same token, I hope voters will look beyond the heated passion of Brexit to a party that offers hope, jobs and genuine concern for the issues that affect people\u2019s lives. And it isn\u2019t futile Farage\u2019s, nor the one led by Alexander de Pfeffel Johnson (trading as Boris) who sprays the North with phoney promises of money and power.\n\nHis lot got the miners and their \u00adfamilies into this mess. His claim to get them out of it truly is fake news.\n\nDaily Mirror news online", "description": "With a budget of \u00a340million, 1,000 jobs would be created to inject hope and some prosperity to areas still struggling after Thatcher's cuts", "authors": ["Paul Routledge"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641787.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS186915557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
