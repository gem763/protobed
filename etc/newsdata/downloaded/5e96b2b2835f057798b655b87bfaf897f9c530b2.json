Costco has stocked its shelves with Pull Apart Cheese Bread from French brand Tipiak, and it makes for a great party appetizer or casual Tuesday-night bite.\n\nPull-apart bread can easily be made from scratch, but now it\u2019s even easier. The crusty bread is cut into cubes without being totally separated, and the slits are filled with brie, Emmental, and mozzarella cheeses.\n\nThanks to Instagram accounts @costcobuys and @costcoguy4you, we know that the cheesy bread, or as the French say, pain au fromage, is available for $10.79. Each package includes two loaves with about 52 pieces each (plus the leftover bottom layer) and can be found in the refrigerated section.\n\nIt takes just 14 to 16 minutes in the oven for the pull-apart bread to be ready. Now all you need is to pick out a good bottle of red wine and your ideal meal is served.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It's made with three types of cheese. \ud83e\uddc0", "authors": ["Caitlyn Fitzpatrick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OvsRbqTcEgpLXmPcMV0bhA--~B/aD01MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/country_living_105/5160c74fefbc232b87db71210b72e43d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
