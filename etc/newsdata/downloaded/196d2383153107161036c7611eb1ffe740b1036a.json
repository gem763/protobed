The ABA has amassed quite the history of bias against conservatives over the last few decades, but with VanDyke, it has really outdone itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanDyke graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School and served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He clerked for Judge Janice Rogers Brown on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit before launching his appellate career. VanDyke has the distinction of having served as both the solicitor general of Montana and Nevada, where he oversaw every important case affecting those states. He has argued over 20 appeals in the federal circuit courts (most in the Ninth Circuit) and has been the counsel of record on 28 briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court. Lawrence VanDyke is one of the standout appellate litigators of his generation.\n\nNonetheless, the ABA has made the astonishing determination that VanDyke is \u201cNot Qualified.\u201d Consider for a moment the absurdity of that conclusion applied to someone who would be the only circuit judge to have served as the chief appellate litigator of two states\u2014and one with major victories under his belt. Yet even the Committee could not ignore the VanDyke\u2019s impressive resume and experience, noting that it \u201cwas tasked with balancing Mr. VanDyke\u2019s accomplishments with strong evidence that supports a \u2018Not Qualified\u2019\u201d rating. So instead, the Committee alleged that Mr. VanDyke lacks \u201cprofessional competence\u201d and \u201cjudicial temperament.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ABA is correct to recognize there are concerns here, but they are properly directed to the ABA and Van Dyke\u2019s lead evaluator, Marcia Davenport, a trial attorney in Montana. A search of Montana\u2019s campaign electronic reporting system shows that in 2014 Davenport contributed $150 to Michael Wheat, VanDyke\u2019s opponent when he ran for a seat on the Montana Supreme Court. Yes, you read that correctly: VanDyke\u2019s lead ABA evaluator has a history of opposing VanDyke politically. Moreover, the linked contribution report shows dozens of campaign contributions made by Ms. Davenport in recent years, but never one to a Republican (note that Davenport\u2019s maiden name is Maynard).\n\nAnd whom did Davenport rely upon in writing her evaluation? We can safely assume that at least one person she interviewed was Michael Black, given her reference to \u201c600 pages of publicly produced emails\u201d that she used in writing her formal report. Black was the Chief of the Civil Division Bureau of the Montana Department of Justice, and also publicly opposed VanDyke when he ran for the Montana Supreme Court, launching personal attacks against VanDyke. After Black came out against VanDyke in 2014, he told the Great Falls Tribune, \u201c[Black\u2019s] had a long, sort of mysterious vendetta against me, and I\u2019m not sure why.\u201d Black unsuccessfully sought a seat on the Montana Supreme Court, applying for an appointment in early 2014 when a seat came open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there you have it. A left-wing partisan who opposed Lawrence VanDyke in Montana led the ABA\u2019s evaluation process, interviewing other political foes of VanDyke and \u2014 surprise! \u2014 found their gripes about his professionalism and temperament to be very credible. And then the ABA Standing Committee blessed that sham of a process by giving VanDyke a \u201cNot Qualified\u201d rating.\n\nThe Code of Judicial Conduct takes the issue of a judge\u2019s impartiality seriously. Canon 3 states: \u201cA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which . . . the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\u201d Yet the ABA\u2014whose self-professed mission is \u201cto serve equally our members, our profession and the public by defending liberty and delivering justice as the national representative of the legal profession\u201d \u2014 ironically can\u2019t recognize the compromised impartiality of VanDyke\u2019s lead evaluator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd of course, this is just one more drop in the bucket with respect to the ABA\u2019s long history of bias against conservative nominees to the judiciary. Thankfully the ABA is given very little credence by Republican presidential administrations and senators because of its embarrassing history, but this latest episode shows that it should have no role whatsoever in the judicial nomination process.", "description": "The ABA has amassed quite the history of bias against conservatives over the last few decades, but with VanDyke, it has really outdone itself.", "authors": ["Carrie Severino", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
