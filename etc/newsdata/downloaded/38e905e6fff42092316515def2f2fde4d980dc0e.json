Photo: Getty Images\n\nImagine admiring someone so much that you emulate them for an entire week; you DM them to invite them to your (probably fake) wedding; you thirstily respond to their social media posts. Okay, now imagine that same person hurting you in such a severe way that you suffer a devastating meltdown. If you have successfully completed this mental exercise, then you can empathize with Tana Mongeau, who just realized that 17-year-old singer Billie Eilish unfollowed her on Instagram.\n\nFor those who have better things to do than follow the disorienting whims of Mongeau, here\u2019s a quick bio: She\u2019s a 21-year-old YouTuber who once threw a disastrous alt-VidCon event, and who recently \u201cmarried\u201d equally chaotic YouTuber Jake Paul. She is also, as can be gleaned from her social media and video channels, obsessed with Eilish. Unfortunately, Eilish doesn\u2019t seem to return the sentiment \u2014 at some point, apparently, she unfollowed Mongeau on Instagram. What happened next was pure madness.\n\nWhile most people might retreat out of embarrassment or sadness \u2014 or, I don\u2019t know, not even notice that one person unfollowed them \u2014 Mongeau instead turned on her video camera and recorded her tearful meltdown, which she uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday. The title of the 15-minute-long video \u2014 which is essentially a compilation of photos of Mongeau looking sad, plus a short video in which she breaks the news \u2014 is simply \u201cBillie Eilish Unfollowed Me.\u201d\n\nBecause this is Mongeau we\u2019re talking about, there\u2019s a 99 percent chance that she\u2019s dramatizing the incident, as well as her reaction. Hell, the description of the video is \u201cI probably deserved it,\u201d and while she\u2019s on camera, she tells viewers, \u201cI have to get views out of it because nothing else good could happen from this.\u201d\n\nI guess \u2026 this means \u2026 Mongeau has gotten exactly what she wants from me. Unfortunately, I simply cannot quit her!!!\n\nStay in touch.
