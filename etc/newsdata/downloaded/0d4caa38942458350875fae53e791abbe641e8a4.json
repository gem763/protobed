North America was down 3.1% and the rest of the world down 15.2%. Online sales also fell by 1.3% to \u00a352.3m, although the company's wholesale business was up 4% to \u00a389.3m.\n\nIn June, Ted Baker's shares lost more than a quarter of their value after the firm warned investors to expect a fall in first-half profits. It blamed \"unseasonable weather\" across North America and heavy discounting.\n\nThese conditions are continuing Mr Bernstein said. \"Trading in the second half has started slowly, not helped by the unseasonably warm weather in September, and this will have an impact on the full year outcome. If these trends continue, we will achieve a second half result below that of last year.\"\n\nThe trading problems are the latest setback for the firm after Mr Kelvin left in March following harassment allegations.\n\nMr Kelvin, who had been chief executive since the company's launch in 1988, resigned over claims he presided over a culture of \"forced hugging\". He has denied all allegations of misconduct.", "description": "The retailer, which issued a profits alert in June, posts a heavy loss and warns of difficult conditions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17726/production/_109083069_gettyimages-1029497354.jpg"}
