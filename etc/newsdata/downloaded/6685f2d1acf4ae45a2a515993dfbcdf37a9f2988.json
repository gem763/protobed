If you do it right, it can have a massive effect on the burn.\n\n\u201cBut of course the best thing to do is not to take part in these stunts in the first place. They may look exciting and spectacular on social media but the reality is very different.\n\n\u201cThey could be killed or scarred for life.\u201d", "description": "A mum has issued a warning to parents about the dangerous social media craze after her son's friend set him alight and he suffered terrible burns", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Nbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533495.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Tabitha-Cleary-Jason-Cleary.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
