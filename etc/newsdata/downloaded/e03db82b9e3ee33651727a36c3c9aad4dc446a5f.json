The city is scheduled to vote on Thursday on a proposed settlement that would award $205,000 (\u00a3159,000) to Ms Simms, according to an official agenda.\n\nMs Simms and her lawyer have agreed to the sum, the San Antonio Express-News reported.\n\nThe potential payout is not the first of its kind in Texas. Last January, officials in Harris County paid $185,000 (\u00a3144,000) to a Houston woman who alleged in a federal lawsuit that her constitutional rights were violated when two sheriff\u2019s deputies performed a cavity search on her near a bustling convenience store, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time.\n\nIn that case, the settlement drew backlash from the woman\u2019s lawyers and advocates, who decried the amount as \u201can injustice\u201d.\n\nThe San Antonio Police Department, the San Antonio City Attorney\u2019s Office and lawyers for Ms Simms did not respond to requests for comment late on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, her troubles began as she sat on a curb on that August night waiting for her boyfriend. Ms Simms was perched near the street, talking on her mobile phone when police officers descended, the suit said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A police detective reportedly said he had seen Ms Simms, who has a criminal record, and another woman walk beneath a highway underpass where they appeared to sell drugs.\n\nFirst, police obtained consent to search Ms Simms\u2019 car, which she gave \u201cknowing that she had done nothing wrong\u201d, court documents said.\n\nMeanwhile, a female officer was called to the scene to search her and it was not long before Ms Wilson, a department veteran, arrived.\n\nAfter looking through her clothing and finding nothing, Ms Wilson, who allegedly did not have a warrant at the time, asked if she could remove the woman\u2019s shorts, making small talk as she continued the search.\n\n\u201cOfficer Wilson was initially talking as if she were sitting down and having a cup of coffee with Natalie,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cUnfortunately, this was not a meeting over coffee, and Officer Wilson\u2019s decision as to how to conduct the search was about to take a turn for the worse.\u201d\n\nThe officer instructed Ms Simms to \u201cspread your legs\u201d, according to a transcript of dash-cam footage included in the lawsuit. She added: \u201dI\u2019m gonna ask you, do you have anything down here before I reach down here?\u201d\n\nMs Simms said she did not and expressed alarm about her intent to examine her vagina, noting that she was on her period. Armed with a flashlight, the officer said she planned only to look, not touch, and \u201cpulled open Natalie\u2019s pants and underwear\u201d, the complaint said. Five other officers, all of whom were men, were nearby.\n\nThat is when Ms Wilson noticed the tampon string and pulled.\n\n\u201cOfficer Wilson did so knowing that Natalie was on her period, and also knowing and seeing that Natalie had a menstrual pad in place,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nStill, Ms Wilson repeatedly asked Ms Simms to confirm she was using a tampon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s full of blood, right?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the officer responded. \u201cIt looked like it had stuff in there.\u201d\n\nIgnoring Ms Simms\u2019s protests that she did not have contraband, Ms Wilson continued her search, at one point even remarking \u201cyou\u2019re very hairy\u201d, the suit alleged.\n\nThen, the officer told Ms Simms to turn around and spread her legs again. There was another place she had yet to look.\n\n\u201cOfficer Wilson had violated Natalie vaginally, and now it appeared that she might violate Natalie anally,\u201d the suit said. \u201cShe was doing so without a warrant, with no medical personnel present, and on a public street in view of several people as well as those passing by.\u201d\n\nThe woman asked multiple times if she could be taken to a police station but her requests were disregarded.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have nothing, you don\u2019t have anything to worry about, okay, but these are all the places that everybody hides stuff, so this is where we have to search,\u201d Ms Wilson told her, according to the transcript.\n\nMs Wilson later testified she has recovered plastic bags containing drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, tied with string from people\u2019s crotches.\n\nIt is unclear if Ms Wilson proceeded with the cavity search. The complaint said Ms Simms ultimately left in her own car after officers did not find anything illegal in her possession.\n\n\u201cEven though Natalie was allowed to leave the scene, a part of her dignity and self-worth was left behind,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nOfficials said Ms Wilson \u201cdid nothing that violated any of the City\u2019s procedures by searching Ms Simms in the manner she searched her\u201d.\n\nInstead of facing serious punishment such as termination, a notation was made in Ms Wilson\u2019s personnel file, the lawsuit alleged.\n\nShe retired in May 2017, about nine months after her encounter with Ms Simms, as a 32-year veteran of the department.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Natalie\u00a0Simms was in shock as she stood, hands raised, on the dimly lighted side street in San Antonio, Texas. A police officer looking for drugs had failed to find anything after combing through her pockets \u2013 but much to Ms Simms\u2019 horror, the search was not\u00a0over. \u201cSpread your legs,\u201d the officer allegedly told her.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/12/istock-479427060.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
