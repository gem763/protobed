(\"We seek out 'dirtbags' who feel more at home in a base camp or on the river than they do in the office,\" reads a book by Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard.)\n\nBut a well-worn surfboard and post-protest jail stint aren't enough to make you the perfect Patagonian. You'll also need to bring something new and different to the company culture. Patagonia doesn't want to hire employees who are identical in their interests and experiences. Above all, Patagonia wants people who are interested in helping others, whether that's by volunteering at an animal shelter or singing in their community choir.\n\nThat's according to Patagonia's head of human resources, finance, and legal, Dean Carter. Business Insider spoke to Carter at LinkedIn's Talent Connect conference, which took place in Dallas in September.\n\nCarter said it's crucial that Patagonia employees feel inspired by the company's mission. At the same time, Carter said, he wants to avoid hiring \"climate drones,\" or people who have no interests beyond saving the planet. Otherwise, he'd wind up with a relatively homogeneous company culture, where everyone thought and behaved the same way.\n\nCarter's approach to hiring is an example of de-emphasizing \"culture fit,\" as management experts begin sounding the alarm on this practice. These experts have found that looking for people who will vibe with your company culture, or who would be a great addition to the team happy hour, often results in an organization where everyone looks and acts similarly \u2014 and no one has any new ideas.\n\nPatagonia wants people who are generally interested in helping others\n\nPatagonia is known for making environmental activism part of its business model.\n\nThe company donates 1% of sales annually to grassroots environmental groups, according to its website. Since 1985, it's donated $89 million to these groups. Patagonia is also a certified B Corp, a certification given to organizations that add value to employees and the environment (and not just shareholders).\n\nAnd in September 2019, Patagonia was named a United Nations Champion of the Earth.\n\nSo Carter looks first and foremost for job candidates who are on board with that strategy \u2014 \"super stoked,\" in his words. These candidates embrace Patagonia's core values, which include \"build the best product,\" by focusing on function, repairability, and durability, and \"use business to protect nature,\" like when the company put its $10 million Trump tax cut into the planet.\n\nAn employee who identifies with those company values is typically a better performer who's likely to stick around.\n\nTactically speaking, that means Carter starts candidate searches by reading r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \"from the bottom up.\" The very first section he checks out is the person's hobbies and interests. In fact, when he posts job openings on his personal LinkedIn page, Carter encourages candidates to include their volunteerism and outdoor interests.\n\n\"We're looking for people who are passionate about the planet, beyond recycling and composting,\" Carter said. For example, maybe the person has worked for an organization that protects the environment.\n\nBut Carter also wants to see if the person has listed other passions and hobbies. Screening for these additional passions serves a dual purpose.\n\nFirst, it helps Patagonia find people who value others' well being. \"I want to know that you care about something beyond yourself,\" Carter said during his keynote presentation at Talent Connect.\n\nSecond, it's a way to avoid hiring the same person over and over again. It's all too easy to fall into a pattern of hiring people who care only about the environment, Carter told Business Insider.\n\nHiring for culture fit can stymie diversity if managers are choosing people who are just like them\n\nThe overarching goal Carter is working toward is \"hiring for culture add, not just a cultural fit,\" he said. The ideal candidate expresses values that align with Patagonia's mission and brings a fresh perspective to the organization, based on their previous career experience or their outside-of-work passions.\n\nIt's probably a wise move. Research suggests that hiring for culture fit can be dangerous, especially if hiring managers use it as a proxy for success on the job.\n\nLauren Rivera, associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, studied hiring at elite professional-services firms and found evidence of bias toward candidates who looked like their potential bosses, or had comparable lifestyles or backgrounds. Maybe, for example, they both love sailing or grew up in the same zip code.\n\nRead more: The cocreator of Netflix's culture deck explains how to decide which employees to fire \u2014 and how to avoid the pitfalls that render so many startup founders 'irrelevant'\n\nHiring managers \"might be motivated to hire the most enjoyable over the most competent candidates,\" Rivera wrote. \"They may hire for themselves rather than for the organization.\"\n\nNot to mention, hiring \u2014 and promoting \u2014 on the basis of culture fit can stymie diversity. In their book, \"The Class Ceiling,\" the sociologists Daniel Laurison and Sam Friedman write that sponsorship by someone senior in the organization \"disproportionately favors those from privileged backgrounds.\"\n\nYet research suggests that diverse business teams are more innovative.\n\nRead more: The reason Melinda Gates almost quit her Microsoft job in the 1980s reveals an unfortunate truth about what it really takes to get ahead at work\n\nAt Patagonia, Carter tries to separate a person's core values from their specific background.\n\nHis goal is to create a company of \"people working toward shared values,\" as opposed to a \"cult\" masquerading as a business. \"That's not what we're going for,\" he said.", "description": "Patagonia HR chief Dean Carter said he looks for job candidates who are passionate about environmental activism \u2014 and also have other interests.", "authors": ["Shana Lebowitz"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9787d04b650712b325df07?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
