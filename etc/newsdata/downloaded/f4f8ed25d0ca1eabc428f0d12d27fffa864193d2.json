Mud-brick houses dot the hilly landscape. Electricity, which arrived in this area just three years ago, is only available in a few homes, and supply can be inconsistent. It only works about five days a week and you never know which five days these will be. And with few paved roads, residents of this remote region rely on mules and bicycles for transportation.\n\nThat the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Canyon has remained relatively untouched by modernity has been a blessing, as it is here that the Pure Nacional tree, which produces some of the world\u2019s rarest cacao, has flourished.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The world\u2019s most expensive wine?\n\n\u2022 Britain\u2019s oldest (and oddest) sweet\n\n\u2022 The mystical tea that fetches $1,850/kg\n\nThis ancient cacao tree originated in the Amazon jungle and holds the distinction of being the oldest and rarest variety, its existence dating back at least 5,300 years. Between the 17th and 19th Centuries, the Pure Nacional was widely cultivated in Ecuador, where its coveted pods helped fuel what was then the world\u2019s largest supply of cacao. But then disaster struck: disease spread through Ecuador\u2019s cacao forests, decimating the highly susceptible Pure Nacional. Through cross-breeding with hardier cacao varieties, farmers were able to eventually stop the spread of the disease, but the new, cross-bred trees no longer produced the high-quality cacao of the Pure Nacional.\n\nBy the early 20th Century, experts declared the Pure Nacional tree extinct, and it was believed that its delectable cacao was lost forever.\n\nUntil recently.\n\nIn 2007, two Americans, Dan Pearson and his stepson Brian Horsley, were supplying gear and food to mining companies around the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Canyon in northern Peru near the Ecuador border when they happened upon a strange-looking tree that had football-sized pods growing out of its trunk. Perplexed and unsure what they were looking at, Pearson and Horsley sent several samples to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to get some answers. To everyone\u2019s amazement, the samples were confirmed to belong to the Pure Nacional tree.\n\nNestled among the jagged Andean peaks, the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River (which happens to be the headwater of the Amazon River) has carved the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Canyon, creating a natural boundary that saved a small group of Pure Nacional trees from disease. Nobody could quite believe that these two men had stumbled upon the long-lost cacao tree. \u201cWhen they called with genetic test results and asked, \u2018Are you sitting down?\u2019 I knew we had found something special,\u201d Pearson said.\n\nThe significance of cacao and its resulting chocolate is tightly woven into Peruvian history. The Mayans attributed great significance to cacao, which they fermented, roasted and ground to make a bitter drink to use in religious rituals. Sixteenth-Century Spanish missionaries in the region considered the Mayan beverage to be rather loathsome, but when sugar was added to it after it was shipped to Spain, chocolate became a hit the world over and a global industry was born \u2013 an industry that for the next few centuries was dominated by chocolate produced with beans of the Pure Nacional.\n\nI knew we had found something special\n\nThat\u2019s because, while most cacao tree pods contain only purple beans, the Pure Nacional trees also produce white beans renowned for their fruity, floral flavour and lack of bitterness. Having survived in isolation for a century, the Pure Nacional trees in the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Canyon developed a genetic mutation causing them to produce pods with a significantly higher white bean-to-purple bean ratio than the trees that had been cultivated in Ecuador centuries before.\n\nFinding these trees was the beginning of Pearson and Horsley\u2019s journey into the world of chocolate. The tree that Pearson and Horsley stumbled upon still stands on the property of a local farmer named Don Fortunato. Using seedlings from what they now call the \u201cmother tree\u201d, the two men founded Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Chocolate and began to propagate the Pure Nacional population in the canyon. Working with local farmers like Fortunato, Pearson and Horsley learned how to care for the trees at their nursery and how to ferment and dry the precious cacao beans once they had been harvested.\n\nOnce these steps had been mastered, Pearson then travelled to Switzerland to have the beans made into a one-of-a-kind chocolate by a renowned chocolate maker. This chocolatier, who Pearson prefers not to name, had been recommended to him by Franz Ziegler, an award-winning author and world-renowned pastry chef, and his colleague Paul Edwards of Chef Rubber, a culinary supply company.\n\n\u201cIn our combined 50 years of working with chocolate, we have never tasted flavours like this,\u201d Zeigler and Edwards said in a 2011 statement when the chocolate was unveiled at the Institute of Culinary Education (ICE) in the United States. \u201cWe had to experience this ourselves so we both travelled to Peru, met the farm families, saw the trees, the white beans and the genetic test and then watched the next evolution in post-harvesting processing that they developed. We saw the past and the future of chocolate.\u201d\n\nToday, Pearson and Horsley continue to cultivate their Pure Nacional trees and harvest the cacao beans according to local tradition \u2013 a process that visitors can witness between mid-January and early June. During harvest season, more than 400 farmers who supply beans to Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Chocolate rise at dawn to hand cut the pods from the trees using long bamboo poles with curved blades at their tips. The pods are left unopened until either Pearson or Horsley arrive to inspect the pods and ensure they contain the correct proportion of white beans. The beans are then extracted by hand, and Pearson or Horsley purchase them from the farmers on the spot, paying almost 50% above the local market price to support the farmers.\n\nThe harvested beans are carried a few kilometres from the farms to the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Chocolate processing facility, first by burros (small donkeys) and then by motorcycle. They are then dried and fermented before being shipped to the chocolate maker in Switzerland. There, the beans are further processed using an antique conching machine (a machine designed to mix and aerate liquid chocolate) from 1879 to produce the final product: Fortunato No 4. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Chocolate\u2019s signature product is named in honour of Don Fortunato, and because the USDA declared the fourth genetic sample that was sent by Pearson for testing to be the legendary lost cacao.\n\nIt's the Rolex of chocolate\n\nChocolate experts around the world have commended Fortunato No 4 for its rich flavour, smooth texture and lack of bitterness. Swiss pastry chef Roger Von Rotz described it as \u201cthe Rolex of chocolate\u201d, while Peruvian chef Gast\u00f3n Acurio said upon sampling it: \u201cI just tried the best chocolate I\u2019ve had in my whole life.\u201d\n\nThe sale of Fortunato No 4 is limited to elite chocolate makers who then mould it into consumer-friendly creations and make it available to buyers through online sales channels or in their local stores. You can acquire chocolate made from Pure Nacional pods from vendors like Moonstruck Chocolate Company in the US, House of Anvers in Australia and Solkiki Chocolatemaker in the UK.\n\nTo be the home of the world\u2019s rarest chocolate fills the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Canyon community with great pride. Thanks to their unique cacao beans, their stature has increased internationally as a result of the recognition they have received from world-renowned chocolatiers.\n\nDon Fortunato, who collects royalties from sales of Fortunato No 4, is a particularly happy man. \u201cIt has helped me financially and it has made me famous,\u201d he said with a proud smile on his face. To this day he continues to care for the Pure Nacional tree on his property, watching over the \u201cmother\u201d of the chocolate that came back from the dead.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
