REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\nSeveral months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, which descended into clashes earlier this week, have forced France\u2019s Hermes and other luxury goods labels to temporarily shut stores and lose out on business in a key shopping hub.\n\nHermes said sales growth in Hong Kong had slowed in the July to September quarter but did not fall, without giving further details.\n\nAt LVMH (LVMH.PA), owner of brands like Louis Vuitton, revenues contracted by around 25% in the period in Hong Kong, while others like Germany\u2019s Hugo Boss (BOSSn.DE) were hit even harder.\n\nBut for Hermes, which like Vuitton and Kering\u2019s (PRTP.PA) Gucci has stood out as one of the industry\u2019s better performers in recent years, growing demand in mainland China more than made up for the hit.\n\nSales growth across the broader Asia region expanded by 20.1% in the third quarter on a comparable basis, accelerating from the previous three months.\n\n\u201cFAVOURABLE TRENDS\u201d\n\nHermes shares were up 2% in early trading.\n\n\u201cThe very favourable trends in mainland China continued into October,\u201d Hermes\u2019 Financial Chief Eric du Halgouet told reporters.\n\nDu Halgouet added that the brand\u2019s e-commerce business in China, launched a year ago, was helping drive sales, and that it was attracting a new generation of young shoppers there.\n\nNot all luxury brands are managing to lure consumers within China to the same degree, and are battling it out by investing in social media marketing campaigns and by opening stores.\n\nOverall, Hermes said revenue rose 18% to 1.7 billion euros ($1.89 billion) in the third quarter.\n\nOn a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and the effect of shop openings, sales were up 15%, accelerating from the 12.3% posted a quarter earlier, and coming in higher than some analysts had expected.\n\nHermes\u2019 silk business recovered slightly from a lull, while its core leather handbag division grew steadily.\n\nThe company - which trades off its \u201cMade in France\u201d cachet and sells high-end bags like the Birkin for over $10,000 - said it was opening three new leather goods workshops in the country between 2020 and 2022 to keep up with demand.\n\nKering and Italy\u2019s Moncler are due to report Q3 sales later on Thursday.
