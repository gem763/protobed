The number of deadly accidents went from an average of 78.2 on any given Monday to an average of 83.5 the Monday following the change.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an abrupt change,\u2019 says Gannon. \u2018Throughout the year seasons change quite gradually. You start with the longest day of the year and then everyday after that it\u2019s slightly shorter and then it\u2019s slightly longer. Daily saving really does add an acute abruptness.\u2019\n\nHe goes on to explain that an increase in road accidents may be caused by our melatonin levels being \u2018completely out of whack\u2019.\n\n\u2018Mosts people\u2019s melatonin peaks at 8pm all the way through to 3am - 4am and it starts diminishing. If you\u2019re then putting the clocks back you're inducing more sleepiness earlier on in the evening.'\n\nSo whilst we might able to rest easy, knowing we have an extra hour in bed this time, it\u2019s worth being cautious on the roads in the evening, when you're prone to a drop in your reaction times.\n\nThere's a spike in heart attacks\n\nWhilst not an issue this time of year, a 2012 study by the University of Alabama at Birmingham suggested that heart attacks spike following the Springtime Daylight Saving Time due to a change in circadian rhythm, sleep deprivation and even a small shock to the immune system.", "description": "A good night's sleep is exactly what the doctor ordered.", "authors": ["Jessica Carpani", "Sophie Tweedale", "Laura Freeman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/health-fitness/2017/10/27/GettyImages-98844131-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RVX_50byq9Ah3wJAV0YS_Ms.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2017-10-27"}
