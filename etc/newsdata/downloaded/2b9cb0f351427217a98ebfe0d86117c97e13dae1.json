He said North Korea, for its part, made \u201csincere efforts\u201d to build mutual trust and carry out the Singapore statement, citing the repatriation of three American detainees and U.S. war remains.\n\n\u201cBut I came to know that President Trump is different from his predecessors in political sense and decision while watching his approach to the DPRK, so I would like to place my hope on President Trump\u2019s wise option and bold decision,\u201d Kim Kye Gwan said, using the abbreviation of his country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\n\u201cI and the DPRK Foreign Ministry will follow the future moves of the U.S.\u201d\n\nKim, in his mid-70s, is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008.\n\nNorth Korea entered talks with the United States last year saying it\u2019s willing to negotiate away its advancing nuclear arsenal in exchange of U.S. security guarantee and sanctions relief. The North wants a slow, step-by-step disarmament process, in which each of its denuclearization step is matched by a corresponding U.S. reward. The United States says sanctions on North Korea will remain in place until the country takes significant steps toward denuclearization.\n\nDuring the Singapore summit, Kim Jong Un promised to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula without providing any timetable or roadmap for disarmament steps. In Singapore, Kim and Trump also agreed to establish new bilateral relations and build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThey met again in Vietnam in February for a second summit. But that meeting abruptly fell apart after Trump rejected Kim\u2019s request for extensive relief of sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step. The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June, and agreed to restart talks.\n\nLast week, North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry said working-level nuclear talks with the United States could resume in a few weeks. But it said discussions of North Korea\u2019s denuclearization will only be possible when \u201cthreats and hurdles endangering our system security and obstructing our development are clearly removed beyond all doubt.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "North Korea said it wants Trump to make a \"wise option and bold decision\" to produce a breakthrough in stalled nuclear diplomacy", "authors": ["Yung-Jin Kim"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/kim_jong_un_trump_nuclear_diplomacy.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
