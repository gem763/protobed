Cowboys trying to avoid third straight loss after starting 3-0. Most recent three-game skid was first three games of RB Ezekiel Elliott's six-game suspension in 2017. ... Elliott needs 66 yards rushing to join Edgerrin James and LaDainian Tomlinson as only NFL backs to reach 4,500 yards rushing and 1,250 yards receiving in first 50 games. Elliott has 1,291 yards receiving going into his 46th game. ... Prescott facing Jets for first time, leaving Patriots, Bills as only teams he hasn't faced \u2014 but plays those two next month.

Cowboys have allowed two straight opponents to rush for more than 100 yards. It has been two years since three straight opponents reached triple digits on ground. ... Jets off to worst start in 16 years, matching 2003 team under Herman Edwards that also opened 0-4. Looking to avoid first 0-5 start since 1-15 season under Rich Kotite in 1996. ...

Jets have two INT returns for TDs (C.J. Mosley and Jamal Adams) and two safeties (Jordan Jenkins and Brian Poole). ... Mosley likely to miss fourth straight game while recovering from groin injury. ... LB Neville Hewitt, filling in for Mosley, leads team with 34 total tackles and two sacks. One of three players in NFL this season with 25 or more tackles, more than one sack and an INT. ... LB Brandon Copeland likely to make season debut after serving four-game suspension for violating NFL's policy on performance enhancers. ... Fantasy tip: Cooper could be in for another huge game, facing Jets secondary that has been shaky. Emerging Cowboys WR Michael Gallup should also be firmly in your lineup this week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
