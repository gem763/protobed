It turned out a very similar thing had happened to her.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s important to talk about it because it probably happens much more than we care to talk about.\n\n\u2018If that happened to my children, I don\u2019t even want to say what I would do. I have no words.\u2019\n\nThe chef won with her cake that she named My Big Fat British Wedding cake which was a raspberry-flavoured mille-feuille.\n\nFinding My Voice is out 17 October 2019.\n\nNeed support?
