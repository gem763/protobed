(AP) - When Avenue Victor Hugo Books met the end of its nearly 30-year run on Boston\u2019s Newbury Street, the building\u2019s monthly rent had been raised from $12,000 to $25,000, and Diesel Jeans was slated to move in.\n\nThat was 2004. The redolent, woody fragrance of cedar and oak, emanating from millions of crusty pages in a dusty atmosphere - held dearly by those who valued the space as a literary haven - faded away.\n\nFifteen years later, the store is newly located in a bucolic red barn in Lee, beside a white farmhouse where owner Vincent McCaffrey now lives with his wife, Thais Coburn, and their daughter and son-in-law. After moving to Lee three years ago, McCaffrey and Colburn decided to revive the erudite escape.\n\nIt\u2019s a reincarnation of the Back-Bay shop, with the same wistfulness and feeling of being homesick, yet not knowing what for. But in New Hampshire, the barn is rent-free and has its own parking. There\u2019s also little-to-no traffic on the quiet country road.\n\nAvenue Victor Hugo opened in 1975, following McCaffrey\u2019s ventures selling books from a pushcart and working as a desk clerk at a city hotel. He\u2019d written his college thesis on bookselling. In Boston, the bookstore held more than a quarter-million magazines and 150,000 used books. It was awarded \u201cbest used bookstore\u201d by Boston Magazine multiple times, and given several other nods, including \u201cmost funky bookstore.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey calls himself a curmudgeon, and says if there was a \u201cmore flamboyant word\u201d for nostalgic, that would describe him perfectly. He doesn\u2019t agree with the way writing is taught in today\u2019s academia; how adjectives and adverbs are discouraged, to make way for conciseness and exactitude. His store preserves what was - an allowance of expression.\n\nLiterature is meant to \u201ccatch the soul of what\u2019s going on,\u201d McCaffrey said, \u201cnot be something a computer could write.\u201d\n\nA handwritten note on a wooden beam in the shop says, \u201cNext time you read, try a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be living in the past, but all of these books have the past in them,\u201d McCaffrey said, as his fingers turned the pages of an \u201cAmerican Mercury\u201d magazine from 1924, a \u201czeitgeist\u201d of the roaring \u201820s.\n\nHe picked up a poetry collection penned by Walter de la Mare, an English writer who lived from 1873 to 1956. \u201cTell me, who reads him anymore?\u201d McCaffrey exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019s forgotten now. He once inspired a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThe name of the shop - Avenue Victor Hugo - is a \u201ctriangulation of various little things,\u201d McCaffrey said, noting Fifth Avenue in Paris, Shakespeare and Company on its Left Bank, and Hugo as an \u201cexemplar\u201d of a writer.\n\nDuring its years at 339 Newbury St., the store played host to Fiction, Galileo and Galaxy magazines, all published by McCaffrey, who is also a novelist himself.\n\n\u201cNewbury Street was hot, and the landlord could get $25,000 for that space, and he did,\u201d McCaffrey said, laughing that he and his wife used to be able to afford a rental on Beacon Hill. \u201cSo, boom, we were out.\u201d\n\nIronically, McCaffrey has a framed copy of the 2004 Boston Globe article announcing their closing. It\u2019s headlined, \u201cThe end.\u201d\n\nThe store is catalogued online, and after closing the Boston store, the business went completely mail order and operated out of a warehouse in Abington, Massachusetts.\n\nAvenue Victor Hugo quietly opened at its Lee location last September, but has since operated under the radar - until recently, when McCaffrey\u2019s son-in-law, Cord Blomquist, set up some social media accounts for the store.\n\nVisitors at the Lee location, where there are more than 20,000 titles, might believe the bookstore has inhabited the space for 100 years. There\u2019s a sign for antique cigar labels, black and white and sepia photographs, and copies of Scribner\u2019s Magazine from the 19th century. A 1970 edition of \u201cSeventeen Magazine\u201d graces one shelf, while other book titles range from \u201cCannibals and Christians,\u201d to \u201cGenes and Evolution,\u201d to an antique Maine state insurance report.\n\n\u201cThe madness of being a bookseller is you keep a lot of stuff,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cIf I buy 10 books this month, I\u2019ll sell probably one or two by next month.\u201d\n\nThere are old maps of New England, Central America, Europe and the Soviet Union, as well as vintage postcards, Egyptian head bookends and a marble statue of a Greek god next to a 1950s radio.\n\nMcCaffrey points to an original 1629 indenture composed for a man set to become a servant, written on sheep skin gut. The shop might as well be a history museum of sorts, not only for its contents, but for the mind of its owner, as well.\n\nMcCaffrey holds up a 1883 copy of Century Magazine, which featured major writers from the period, addressed everything from growing flowers to architecture, and published personal accounts of Civil War soldiers.\n\n\u201cThis came out every week, and the middle class was exposed to this stuff on a daily basis,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cIt was thinking. People had wonderful arguments in bars over the issues.\u201d\n\nThe shop\u2019s two biggest categories are fiction and history, as well as collectible magazines including Harper\u2019s, Atlantic, Life, Saturday Evening Post, National Geographic, Playbill, Punch, Theatre Arts, and hundreds of others.\n\n\u201cThis is a thing that\u2019s missing today,\u201d Blomquist said of the shop, while standing under its wide ceiling beams.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Avenue Victor Hugo Books met the end of its nearly 30-year run on Boston's Newbury Street, the building's monthly rent had been raised from $12,000 to $25,000, and Diesel Jeans was slated to move in.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hadley Barndollar"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
