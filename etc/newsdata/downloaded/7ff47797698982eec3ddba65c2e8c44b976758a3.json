Ongoing charges: 0.13%\n\nHSBC FTSE All World Index Fund C\n\nThis follows a global index that also includes an emerging markets element. Ongoing charges: 0.16%\n\niShares MSCI ACWI ETF\n\nThis is an ETF that follows an index made up of both developed and emerging markets companies.Ongoing charges: 0.6%\n\nActive funds\n\nThese are four of the most popular global funds and investment trusts\n\nLindsell Train Global Equity\n\nThis fund buys and holds what the well-respected managers Michael Lindsell and Nick Train see as the world\u2019s best companies.\n\nNick Train has been dubbed Britain's answer to Warren Buffett due to his buy and hold quality and value strategy. This global equity fund run with his business partner has paid off handsomely, with its relatively small portfolio making it third best sector performer over five years. Ongoing charges: 0.74%\n\nFundsmith Equity\n\nTerry Smith\u2019s fund invests in global companies he perceives as having an enduring advantage.

These companies are picked due to their high return on and considered as those with the power to turn cash into consistent profit.\n\nPerformance has been good but it is heavily weighted to the US, read more on Fundsmith here. Ongoing charges: 0.97%\n\nWitan investment trust\n\nThis investment trust targets long-term growth and invests with a variety of fund managers around the world, however, a third of it is in UK shares.\n\nWitan is offered recommended as a solid cornerstone investment in a portfolio and due to its multi-manager approach it spreads its risk widely, with no single company making up more than 2% of the trust's holdings. Ongoing charges: 0.86%\n\nScottish Mortgage\n\nThis is the third best-performing global investment trust over ten years and Scottish Mortgage regularly features on best buy lists. It is a big trust that's cheap to own and which targets what the managers see as the world's most exciting companies.\n\nThat means big bets on firms they think could change the world, such as Tesla, Amazon and Baidu, and also investments in companies not listed on the stock market. Its investment strategy has paid off but means it is riskier than other options.
