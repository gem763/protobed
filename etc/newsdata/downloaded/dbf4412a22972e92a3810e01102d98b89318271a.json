Here\u2019s what you need to know about the infamous ISIS leader\n\nStrangely, the first version of the story described al-Baghdadi as \u201cIslamic State\u2019s terrorist-in-chief,\u201d only for it to later be changed to \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d. Perhaps the paper\u2019s editors didn\u2019t want to offend their IS readers?\n\nThe headline sparked a furious reaction on social media, with many struggling to comprehend why the Post had chosen to frame the story in this manner.\n\nfrom now on to the end of time, whenever the Washington Post analyzes Trumps words, please remind them that they once described a mass murdering serial rapist ISIS ghoul as an \"austere religious scholar.\" https://t.co/nNhbtFRPcl \u2014 GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cStop, read this and think about it: last night a ruthless, brutal terrorist who threatened our country & is responsible for the death of American citizens was killed in a successful operation by US military & Washington Post described al-Bagdadi as an \u2018austere religious scholar,\u2019\u201d former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer wrote on Twitter.\n\nOthers ridiculed the paper, posting fictional obituaries under the hashtag #WaPoDeathNotices. Would the paper have described serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer as an\"unconventional romantic and avant-garde gastronomist,\" or Bonnie and Clyde as wealth re-distributors in the banking sector?\"\n\nAdolf Hitler, passionate community planner and dynamic public speaker, dies at 56.#WaPoDeathNotices \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) October 27, 2019\n\nWitch of the West, pioneering female aviator, dead at 480.\n\n\n\n#WaPoDeathNoticespic.twitter.com/pXUMlQilvf \u2014 Forcebalance (@Forcebalance) October 27, 2019\n\nDarth Vader; Noted single-father, brilliant inventor, pod-racing enthusiast and passionate spiritual leader.
