But their similarities range from the biographical\u2014both are former state attorneys general\u2014to the political process-related: Both started their race late. (Bullock declared in May, the second-to-last Democrat to enter, and Clinton didn\u2019t announce until October 1991, just four months before primary voting started.) \u201cI think there is a governing and a win-over-tough-votes similarity with then-Governor Clinton,\u201d says Nick Baldick, who arrived at Clinton headquarters in November 1991 and is now a senior adviser to Bullock\u2019s campaign.\n\nOne of the most popular themes among Democratic presidential candidates over the past few months has been calling on people to think not just about Donald Trump, but about how America reached the point where Trump\u2019s win was possible. That\u2019s a regular part of the stump speech for, among others: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nBullock doesn\u2019t invoke Clinton on the stump or in private, though he does enjoy talking about the larger history of come-from-behind candidacies. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s stubbornness when you\u2019re four months into this, where you really want to make sure that at some point, not only can you beat him, but government can work again,\u201d Bullock said.\n\nClinton was the last Democratic nominee who won in many states that are now far out of reach for the party\u2014West Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia, to name a few\u2014and the only Democrat in 100 years to beat an incumbent Republican, who didn\u2019t have the Great Depression or the Watergate scandal to thank for it. He was also the last Democratic president who regularly got Republican votes for any significant legislation he supported (almost everything that Barack Obama accomplished legislatively happened within the first two years of his presidency, when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate). Bullock likes to note that he passed, among other things, dark-money restrictions and a major Medicaid expansion with a heavily Republican state legislature.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on is people understood how Bill Clinton could get things done, understood how to work with both sides,\u201d Kantor, who had breakfast recently with Bullock, told me. \u201cI think that comes from having to work with a Republican legislature.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this cycle different from other cycles? Could it be that it\u2019s impossible to make a comeback if you\u2019re not on the debate stage, given this set of rules? Maybe, maybe even probably,\u201d said Matt Bennett, the vice president of the Clinton-inspired Third Way think tank and a veteran of the Clinton campaigns. \u201cThen again, if you look at the people who became the nominee, a whole bunch of them were way, way back in fields that were smaller than this one.\u201d Both in person and over the phone, Bennett has urged Bullock to keep at it, especially after the August dropouts of Washington Governor Jay Inslee and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. \u201cHe\u2019s the only governor still in the race, he found a way to win in a red state\u2014he\u2019s the only person who could say that,\u201d Bennett said.", "description": "Members of the Clinton diaspora are pleading with the Montana governor to stay in the race, even if the rest of the country doesn\u2019t know who he is.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Bullock/facebook.jpg?1568903264", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
