The public would expect nothing less,\" it said.\n\nBA pilots are due to strike on Monday and Tuesday over a pay offer pilots' union Balpa says is too low.\n\nThe vast majority of flights are expected to be cancelled on those two days, causing knock-on disruption.\n\nBA would not say how many flights had been affected, but reports suggested it was around 1,600 flights.\n\n\"Nobody should have their travel plans disrupted or their holidays ruined,\" Number 10 said.\n\nThe airline says it has emailed customers travelling on flights that are affected but the flight's status can still be checked on the website.\n\nThe airline is drafting in larger aircraft from partner airlines Iberia and Aer Lingus to take the maximum number of customers.\n\nThe airline and the union did not provide an update on the status of their dispute on Friday.\n\nThe two-day strike, set for next week, follows failed negotiations between the union and the airline over a pay offer of 11.5% over three years.\n\n'Constructive talks'\n\nUnite and GMB, representing cabin crew and engineers, have accepted the offer.\n\nHowever, pilots have argued that the pay award should be higher, following recent years of low pay increases and BA's recent strong financial performance.\n\nBA has said it was open to \"constructive talks\", but said Balpa was not acting in good faith.\n\nThe union has said it would call off the strike if BA would discuss a new proposal outlined in a letter on Thursday to the airline.\n\nThe union's general secretary Brian Strutton said his members were still \"very angry\" with BA, but were also willing to be flexible.\n\n\"They also want to leave no stone unturned in trying to find a resolution to their dispute,\" he said.\n\nIn response, BA had said: \"We do not believe the union is acting in good faith by making an 11th-hour inflated proposal which would cost an additional \u00a350m.\"\n\nThe airline said Balpa should return to the talks without pre-conditions. The union was acting \"cynically\" by waiting until a late stage when the airline had already made arrangements to manage the industrial action, BA added.\n\n\"Our customers need the certainty that Balpa will call off the strikes for good, not just for two days next week,\" the airline said.\n\nA further day of strike action is scheduled for 27 September.\n\nWill you be affected by next week's BA strike?
