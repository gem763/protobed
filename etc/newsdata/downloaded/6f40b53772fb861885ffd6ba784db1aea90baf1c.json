He was consistently the best in training.\n\n'It was to the point where some of the best players in the world were standing there applauding what he was doing.'\n\nSarri did play Hudson-Odoi in various cup matches but the youngster is set to play regularly under Lampard now he has returned from an Achilles tendon rupture.\n\nEx-Chelsea keeper Rob Green said players were asking why Sarri wasn't picking Hudson-Odoi\n\nAnd Green believes the players natural confidence will enable him to thrive in the game at the highest level.\n\nHe said: 'He has got such a brilliant mind and he is so confident. When he goes out there he will try things and he will try it on the biggest stage.\n\n'He will do something and you will ask him: 'When have you done that? Why did you do that?'\n\n'He would say \"because I've never done it before and I thought I'd try it\".\n\nHudson-Odoi looks set to enjoy much more game time this season under Frank Lampard\n\n'You knew from the way he spoke and the way he is around the lads, the way he holds himself and obviously his ability, he is going to be at Chelsea for as long as he wants to be and then, maybe, on to greater things.'\n\nHudson-Odoi was selected for the England Under-21 squad for the latest round of international fixtures as opposed to Gareth Southgate's senior squad.", "description": "Chelsea's stars were left questioning why Callum Hudson-Odoi wasn't in their team last season, according to former goalkeeper Rob Green.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19384834-0-image-a-6_1570435512125.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
