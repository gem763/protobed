But we are concerned that Schiff is putting her in a precarious position by having her testify in secret without State Department lawyers present,\u201d the White House memo stated.\n\n\u201cOnly State Department lawyers would be able to provide Yovanovitch with the correct counsel on what is classified or privileged and without that counsel there is serious danger that she could breach her obligations as a current employee not to reveal such information without authorization,\u201d the memo continues.\n\nThe email is the second one in a month from the White House containing a planned response to House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.
