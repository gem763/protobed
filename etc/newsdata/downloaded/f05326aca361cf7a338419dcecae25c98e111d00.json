If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Utah Republican senator Mitt Romney wrote on Twitter. \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nBut Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio is unperturbed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a real request,\u201d Rubio told reporters. \u201cI think he did it to provoke you to ask me and others and get outraged by it.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s defense doesn\u2019t make any sense if you listen to or read Trump\u2019s full comments:\n\nREPORTER: Mr. President, what exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens after your phone call? Exactly. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed \u2014 and all these companies, if you look at \u2014 And, by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\n\nThe president is quite plainly saying in public that foreign governments should investigate the Bidens, and he\u2019s not joking.\n\nWhat would Rubio say if President Barack Obama had called on China to investigate Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2011? It\u2019s not hard to imagine.", "description": "What would Rubio say if President Obama had called on China to investigate Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2011?
