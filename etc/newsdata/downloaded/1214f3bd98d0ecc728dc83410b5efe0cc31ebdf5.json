Some experts say they send a bad message.", "language": "en", "text": "In a Sept. 9 blog post, Gunter described what she saw on the University of Utah Health website: the suggestion that a woman schedule a premarital exam \u201cto confirm that her body is ready for sex\u201d and explore using a vaginal dilator, as first reported by the Salt Lake Tribune. The health-care system also suggested a link between condoms and urinary tract infections, and it recommended that women consider getting antibiotics in case they develop a UTI on their honeymoon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt seems very patriarchal to me and not scientific,\u201d Gunter told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd certainly I\u2019m unfamiliar with any of these practices.\u201d\n\nPremarital exams are considered first gynecological visits in which doctors also try to educate women about their sexual health and forge relationships with them. Experts say women learning about their bodies is positive but that these exams sometimes promote scientifically inaccurate information, make sex sound like a medical condition and imply that women need preparation for sexual intimacy that men do not.\n\nThe concept of a premarital exam is largely unique to Utah, where public school teachers are required to promote abstinence. They are allowed to teach about contraception and preventing sexually transmitted diseases but cannot encourage the use of contraception or teach the intricacies of intercourse. The demand for premarital exams, experts say, indicates a hunger in the state for earlier and more comprehensive sex education.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA child\u2019s sexual health begins before they get married,\u201d said Kristin Hodson, founder of the Utah-based Healing Group, which promotes sexual and other types of health. \u201cIt begins before they are sexually active.\u201d\n\nHodson said the fact that there is a need for that kind of an exam in the first place suggests Utah needs to do better in sexual health education.\n\nReferring to a woman\u2019s first gynecological exam as a \u201cpremarital exam\u201d caters to terminology that the heavily Mormon population of Utah is familiar with, Hodson said. Many female members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which forbids sexual intimacy before marriage, seek premarital exams to prepare to have sex for the first time. Mothers often pass down the tradition to their daughters.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Hodson said she supports the exams\u2019 goal of connecting women with sexual health care, she said she is concerned that some of the commonly used language frames sex as a medical issue, rather than as a normal human activity. Hodson said promoting the use of a dilator, which is unnecessary for most people, is an example of how premarital exams can make sexual intimacy sound like a problem to be solved.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a disease model, rather than, \u2018This is a normal, healthy part of life,\u2019 \u201d Hodson said. \u201cLike, \u2018We need to prepare your vagina in a medical way to make sure sex is okay,\u2019 rather than, \u2018Look, people can have really positive first-time experiences.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGunter, the OB/GYN and author, said she thought premarital exams could unnecessarily scare women about sex and that targeting them only toward women was patriarchal. She said she also was put off by what she saw as the suggestion that women need to prepare their bodies for sex and that waiting until immediately before marriage was the right time to do so.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is true that women may want to come in and get some education about their bodies if they can\u2019t get it somewhere else,\u201d Gunter said. \u201cBut to suggest that the only time you would want to get educated about your body is before your wedding night is a little bit more problematic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUniversity of Utah Health has revised its main website page about premarital exams since Gunter published her blog post. The page now calls the consultations \u201csexual health visits\u201d and states that the health-care system does not recommend that women take antibiotics before sexual activity if they do not have an infection. The information about dilators has been removed.\n\nOfficials and doctors at University of Utah Health declined an interview request from The Post but said in a statement that staff members seek to offer relevant, accessibly worded medical information to a variety of communities with different health-care needs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur objective in serving the segment of our patient population that requests \u2019premarital visits\u2019 is to inform and educate \u2014 and in so doing build lifelong relationships as their trusted health care partner,\u201d Kathy Wilets, a spokeswoman for the health-care system, said in the statement.\n\nAD\n\nWilets told the Salt Lake Tribune that although the medical term for the consultation is \u201csexual health visit,\u201d the health-care system started using the phrase \u201cpremarital exam\u201d after noticing that women were using that name to ask for the consultations and search for them online.\n\nThe website pages about premarital exams were targeted toward \u201cheterosexual women who have remained abstinent from sexual activity, are about to get married and who have questions/concerns about their first sexual experience,\u201d Wilets told the Tribune. The health-care system plans to update its website soon to include information about sexual health visits for men after seeing an increased interest in the topic, Wilets said.\n\nAD\n\nTiffany Weber, an OB/GYN at University of Utah Hospital, told the Tribune that many women who seek premarital exams \u201chave misinformation and misconceptions.\u201d The consultations are meant to ensure the patients\u2019 safety as they begin having sex, she said.\n\nAD\n\nThe patients only need physical exams if they have particular worries or symptoms, Weber told the Tribune. She said the health-care system\u2019s website previously mentioned dilators and getting prescriptions for antibiotics in case of UTIs even though they are \u201cactually not evidence-based procedures\u201d because patients frequently wanted to talk about them.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Learning about your body is good, experts say, but a \"premarital exam\" makes sex sound like a medical condition, and it implies women need preparation for sexual intimacy that men do not.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kS9O2b2q0brhNj6fp0AgMu3BjH4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BLWFFRCASQI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
