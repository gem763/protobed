What he needs to work out is how much pressure England is under, because they will have memories of the tournament from four years ago where it didn\u2019t go that good.\n\n\u201cThey had a massive disappointment at the last World Cup and they will be under immense pressure themselves. For him to say they have nothing to lose - Eddie doesn\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHansen, who has made one change to his side, preferring Scott Barrett to Sam Cane at flanker, then inferred that England could be in trouble if they read too much into their resounding 40-16 quarter-final win over Australia.\n\n\u201cSometimes people will come off the euphoria of winning the quarter-final and start looking ahead at the final,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is a mistake we have made in the past.\n\n\u201cIf you start looking beyond where you\u2019re at then your mind isn\u2019t where your feet are and that makes you vulnerable.\u201d\n\nBeneath the public words there lurks a healthy mutual respect with Jones admitting a win over the All Blacks would be the football equivalent of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United knocking Liverpool off their perch in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been involved in rugby the country you want to knock off is New Zealand, because they\u2019ve been the best,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the opportunity to change rugby history on Saturday and the whole team is excited about it.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones claimed his side had been spied on while training this week ahead of their World Cup semi-final", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716202.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RUGBYU-WC-2019-NZL-TRAINING.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
