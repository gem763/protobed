In an apparent retaliation by Kurdish-led forces, six people including a 9-month-old baby were killed by mortar and rocket fire into Turkish border towns, officials in southeastern Turkey said.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee said 64,000 people in Syria have fled since the campaign began. The towns of Ras al-Ain and Darbasiya, some 60 km (37 miles) to the east, have been largely deserted as a result of the attack.\n\nThe Observatory said Turkish forces had seized two villages near Ras al-Ain and five near the town of Tel Abyad, while a spokesman for Syrian rebel forces said the towns were surrounded after fighters seized the villages around them.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defence Ministry said 174 militants had been killed so far. Kurds said they were resisting the assault.\n\nAccording to a senior Turkish security official, the armed forces struck weapons and ammunition depots, gun and sniper positions, tunnels and military bases.\n\nJets flew operations up to 30 km (18 miles) into Syria - a limit which Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said Turkish forces would not go beyond. A Reuters journalist saw shells exploding just outside Tel Abyad.\n\nTrump, who has faced rare criticism from senior figures in his own Republican Party who accuse him of deserting loyal U.S. allies, said on Twitter that he was talking to \u201cboth sides\u201d. He warned Ankara it would be hit hard financially if it did not \u201cplay by the rules\u201d.\n\nThe SDF have been the main allies of U.S. forces on the ground in the battle against Islamic State since 2014. They have been holding thousands of captured IS fighters and tens of thousands of their relatives in detention.\n\n\u2018SAFE ZONE\u2019\n\nNATO member Turkey has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d for the return of millions of refugees to Syria.\n\nBut world powers fear the operation could intensify Syria\u2019s eight-year-old conflict and runs the risk of Islamic State prisoners escaping from camps amid the chaos.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan sought to assuage those concerns, saying militants from the jihadist group would not be allowed to rebuild a presence in the region.\n\nHe took aim at the European Union and Arab powers Saudi Arabia and Egypt which have voiced opposition to the operation.\n\n\u201cThey are not honest, they just make up words,\u201d Erdogan said in a combative speech to members of his AK party. \u201cWe, however, take action and that is the difference between us.\u201d\n\nHe threatened to permit Syrian refugees in Turkey to move to Europe if EU countries described his forces\u2019 move as an occupation. Turkey is hosting around 3.6 million people who have fled the conflict in Syria.\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Tel Abyad, as seen from the Turkish border town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nAnkara brands the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists because of their ties to militants who have waged an insurgency in Turkey. But many members of Congress, and U.S. officials, credit the Kurds with fighting alongside American troops to defeat Islamic State militants.\n\n\u2018BAD IDEA\u2019\n\nThe Kurdish-led authority in northern Syria said a prison that holds \u201cthe most dangerous criminals from more than 60 nationalities\u201d had been struck by Turkish shelling, and Turkey\u2019s attacks on its prisons risked \u201ca catastrophe\u201d.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey will be responsible only for Islamic State prisoners located within the safe zone it aims to form. Turkey would ask countries from which the prisoners came to take them back.\n\nTrump has called the Turkish assault a \u201cbad idea\u201d and said he did not endorse it. He said he expected Turkey to protect civilians and religious minorities and prevent a humanitarian crisis.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a vocal Trump ally, has been one of the most outspoken critics of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. He unveiled a framework for sanctions on Turkey with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\nTheir proposed sanctions would target the assets of senior officials including Erdogan, mandate sanctions over Turkey\u2019s purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defence system and impose visa restrictions.\n\nThey also would sanction anyone who conducted military transactions with Turkey or supported energy production for use by its armed forces, apart from U.S. military assistance. The measure would require a report on Erdogan\u2019s net worth and assets.\n\n\u201cIf there is any measure taken against us, we will retaliate and respond in kind,\u201d Cavusoglu said, adding that \u201cnothing will come of these sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was due to meet on Thursday to discuss Syria at the request of the five European members: Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Turkey\u2019s military incursion and cautioned about the possibility of ethnic cleansing. \u201cIsrael is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the gallant Kurdish people,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nRussia said it planned to push for dialogue between the Syrian and Turkish governments following the incursion.", "description": "Turkey pounded Kurdish militia in northeast Syria for a second day on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee and killing dozens, in a cross-border assault on U.S. allies that has turned the Washington establishment against Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439382166&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991DJ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
