In his rise to the British premiership, Johnson argued that his predecessor, Theresa May, had simply not been staunch enough in her approach to Brexit\u2014either with members of Parliament or with the European Union. He positioned himself as the man with enough spine to stick with it, and even demanded that the EU compromise\u2014though he held little leverage over Europe\u2014and expressed optimism it would give in. In his first speech to Parliament, he boasted of his Conservatives, \u201cWe are now the party of the many.\u201d\n\nNo more. As Johnson spoke on Tuesday, one of his lawmakers left the party\u2014physically and practically\u2014depriving Johnson of his majority. By the end of the day, he had expelled another 21 members of the party, among them Parliament\u2019s longest-serving member; the man who served as the powerful chancellor of the Exchequer until July; and the grandson of Winston Churchill, of whom Johnson wrote a hagiographic biography. Johnson says he will not resign and is seeking a new election. If the last three years have taught us anything about Johnson, it\u2019s that he has a knack for coming back from apparent death blows. But if he does manage to cling to power, polls suggest it will be weakly, in a coalition government. Sticking to a path in face of repeated failures may be courageous, but it may also be insane.\n\nNetanyahu is not a newcomer to power\u2014in June, he became Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister\u2014but his populist, nationalist appeal is similar, and so is his message that he is the indispensable leader for Israel. Israeli voters, however, are no longer as convinced as they once were. After elections in April, he failed to build a governing coalition, which is why there are new elections this month. Even within his own Likud Party, there seems to be some appetite for moving past Netanyahu\u2014which could pose a problem for him, because losing the premiership might expose him to prosecution. Trump, a close ally, is reportedly working with Netanyahu on a grand gesture to help him before the voting, but having already moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel, the president has already used many of his most potent tools.\n\nRead: Italy\u2019s transition from one weak government to another\n\nFinally, there is Trump himself. He, too, portrayed himself as both the representative of a \u201csilent majority\u201d of Americans but also a singular figure who could succeed where no other politician could. \u201cI alone can fix it,\u201d he said as he accepted the Republican nomination. More than three years later, there is little evidence to back that claim up, even on Trump\u2019s own terms. Few of Trump\u2019s top priorities have been fulfilled: His border wall is unbuilt, the flow of migrants to the U.S. continues, Obamacare remains in place, the trade war with China remains unwon, and his NAFTA replacement is still in limbo. More broadly, America remains riven with the tensions that existed before Trump entered office. Trump\u2019s approval rating continues to hover around 40 percent, right where it\u2019s been throughout his presidency. Whatever it means to make America great again, it doesn\u2019t seem to have happened.", "description": "Around the world, nationalist governments that claimed to speak for silent majorities are hanging on to power with minority support.", "authors": ["David A.
