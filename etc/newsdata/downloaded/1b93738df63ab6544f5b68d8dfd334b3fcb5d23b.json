However, after his rematch with Conor McGregor took place in 2016, Diaz went more than three years without stepping into the octagon. A win over Anthony Pettis in August at UFC 241 set up Diaz for the fight with Masvidal (34-13 MMA, 11-6 UFC) on Nov. 2 at Madison Square Garden, and it pleases Gracie to see his longtime friend.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Gracie told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at UFC on ESPN+ 19 media day on Thursday. \u201cNate\u2019s finally getting what he wanted, the recognition that he deserves, and he basically took that. He didn\u2019t ask nobody for no favors, and no one was giving him no time of day at a certain point. He basically took that into his own hands, the power of his mind and his training and his fights and everything, and he was like, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to just go take what\u2019s mine.\u2019 He did. That\u2019s all thanks to him and his spirit.\u201d\n\nAlthough there\u2019s been some criticism about the \u201cBMF,\u201d or \u201cBaddest Mother(Expletive),\u201d title that Diaz and Masvidal will compete for at UFC 244, Gracie is all about it.\n\n\u201cHe created this belt out of thin air, and now it\u2019s a belt,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cI saw it on ESPN, and it said \u2018Masvidal is fighting for the BMF belt.\u2019 On ESPN it was a little thing and I was like, \u2018What the (expletive)? They\u2019re fighting for a belt now?\u2019 This guy is amazing. It goes to show. I don\u2019t need to say how impressive that is and how much of a star he is. I knew that from the beginning. I knew what he was and how powerful him and his brother are.\u201d\n\nGracie (5-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC), who fights Cub Swanson (25-11 MMA, 10-7 UFC) in a featherweight bout on Saturday at UFC on ESPN+ 19, clearly has admiration for not only Nate Diaz, but his bother Nick, too. He revealed how their bond formed, all starting with a hand-selected process from Gracie.\n\n\u201cI was looking at all the fighters when I was getting into fighting, and I was like, \u2018Hmm,'\u201d Gracie said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of teams next to my gym, all these places. Where am I going to go train for a fight? Who do I want to train with?\u2019 Nick and Nate. I was like, \u2018These guys are it. This is where I want to learn and what team I want to be with.\u2019 I made the decision, and coincidentally around the same time Nick and Cesar (Gracie) had asked me to come help him train Georges St-Pierre the first time when it got canceled. So we already had a connection there.\n\n\u201cLong story short, I was like, \u2018This is my team.\u2019 I still drive six hours to go train with them. I made it my team. I drove six hours to make it my team. Then they drove six hours to train with me at my gym, and there\u2019s never enough amount of time to be around them. We always want more time with Nick, we always want more time with Nate, and we get what we can.\u201d", "description": "Ahead of his UFC on ESPN+ 19 fight, Kron Gracie says he can't spend enough time around the Nick and Nate Diaz.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kron-gracie-ufc-tampa-open-workouts.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
