He was set to scrap with 99 other hopefuls in a quest to be the last to survive in a hail of cartoonish gunfire, with the ultimate victor walking away $3m richer.\n\n\u201cOn the day I was pretty nervous,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really nice to be there and to see all the seats filling up with people watching us. I wasn\u2019t nervous in the games but beforehand leading up to it I definitely had some butterflies.\u201d\n\nIn the event, Smith finished 44th and netted $50,000. However that wasn\u2019t enough for the Mansfield teen who had his sights on loftier goals.\n\n\u201cI wish it went differently,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the best day. I know 44th in the world out of the millions that played is really good, but it\u2019s not good enough for me. I know I\u2019m better than that, so being labelled as 44th for a year... it hurts, you know what I mean?\u201d", "description": "It was an overwhelming feeling, Jake Smith recalls, as the 18-year old from Nottinghamshire took his seat in the elaborate tower of computer terminals at the famous Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York city, ready to compete in front of 20,000 fans for a share of $30m (\u00a324m) at the finals of the Fortnite World Cup.", "authors": ["Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2019/09/26/DSC04913-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqnle5o_U6FaKPrwbwd8gradw0pxJhGM6pTCcAUmNbB_0.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
