It\u2019s the law,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nThe Pac-12 Conference has condemned the law, which was signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday. Coaches across the league were uncertain about what it might mean for them, especially in terms of recruiting. Four of the league\u2019s teams are located in California: Stanford, Cal, UCLA and USC.\n\nThe law does not take effect until 2023. The schools would not pay the players for their likenesses, but players could be compensated by outside companies. Other states are considering similar legislation.\n\nKelly wasn\u2019t alone among his Pac-12 counterparts in his pragmatism. Almost all of the league\u2019s coaches responded that they were taking a wait-and-see approach to the issue when asked about it. The conference, however, was clear.\n\n\u201cThis legislation will lead to the professionalization of college sports and many unintended consequences related to this professionalism, imposes a state law that conflicts with national rules, will blur the lines for how California universities recruit student-athletes and compete nationally, and will likely reduce resources and opportunities for student-athletes in Olympic sports and have a negative disparate impact on female student-athletes,\u201d the Pac-12\u2019s statement said.\n\nThe concern among coaches is that top recruits might favor teams in California because of the opportunity to make money. Or, it could hurt recruiting if California teams are declared ineligible for postseason play because the new law conflicts with NCAA rules.\n\n\u201cWe believe that policy change around student-athlete name, image and likeness needs to be addressed at the national level to assure consistency and a level playing field across all states and intercollegiate athletic conferences,\u201d said a statement released by the office of the president at Cal.\n\nStanford released a similar statement, which said \u201ctrue progress can only be achieved when it is undertaken at the national level, with appropriate safeguards against unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nKelly was at odds with the conference when he said he agreed with the premise of the new law and said it was the \u201cright thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost the universities, it doesn\u2019t cost the NCAA, and what it did before is it put restrictions on athletes and it no longer does and I think it\u2019s progress,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the Olympics used to just be for amateurs. The Olympic model changed over time, so I would imagine the NCAA model has to change over time.\u201d\n\nOregon coach Mario Cristobal also walked the fine line of wanting to do what\u2019s right by his players while also acknowledging he hadn\u2019t really studied the issue.\n\n\u201cI certainly believe that in any way that we can help the student-athletes I think it\u2019s our obligation, our responsibility. We certainly do a lot for them here. I know what it\u2019s like. I\u2019ve been there,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about how, what the rules are, what the format is for that. I\u2019m all for making sure that we maximize what they can benefit or how they can benefit.\u201d\n\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham expressed confidence the NCAA would address the matter long before the law takes hold. Indeed, the main governing body for collegiate sports has a committee that has been looking at the issue. A report is due later this fall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure by then (2023) things will get ironed out where it\u2019s equitable. So that\u2019s so far away that we don\u2019t want to deal with it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to deal with it right now. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be something that throws everything out of whack. I think they\u2019ll find a way to make it workable,\u201d he said.\n\nArizona coach Kevin Sumlin echoed Whittingham: \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot of different changes before 2023 with this whole thing, they\u2019ve been talking about it for a while. I\u2019ll answer that in 2023.\u201d\n\nWashington coach Chris Petersen clearly wanted to distance himself from the issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how all this is going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily it\u2019s not a problem I have to solve. So, good luck.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "UCLA coach Chip Kelly was succinct when asked his opinion of California's new law that would allow college athletes to be paid for the use of their names and likenesses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
