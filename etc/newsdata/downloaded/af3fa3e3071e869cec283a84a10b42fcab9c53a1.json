And Moret offers a spirited defense of any accusation that the VEDP is engaged in corporate welfare by providing companies with financial incentives to locate or expand in the commonwealth.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s important to understand that Virginia is one of the smallest incentive states in America,\u201d Moret told Watchdog.org, adding that the state gives our relatively small incentive packages to businesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the companies\u2019 welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the welfare of our economy.\u201d\n\nIn the future, the VEDP will be a lot less focused on incentives as an economic development tool, according to Moret. Instead, the partnership will be looking more to improve workforce development, expand broadband access and generally make the state a more attractive place for investment, he said.\n\nVirginia already has the built-in advantages of having public schools and institutions of higher education that are among the best in the nation, along with one of the best overall business climates, Moret said.\n\nCurrent changes at the VEDP are about two key issues, one of which is to address all the shortcomings mentioned in the legislative audit, he said. The second is more broad-based.\n\n\u201cIf you think about Virginia, this is one of America\u2019s premier states, so we want to create a state economic development organization that is equal to the aspirations that we have for Virginia,\u201d Moret said.\n\nThe VEDP will report back to the General Assembly before the end of the year, and he expects to be able to say that the clear majority of the recommendations will have been fulfilled. A timeline for whatever changes remain will also be laid out, Moret said.\n\nThough the legislative audit focused on VEDP problems, it gave the agency high marks for its efforts at helping companies develop or expand their presence in international markets. The legislature passed a measure that would have shifted the international trade role to a separate agency, he said, but lawmakers eventually decided not to implement it.\n\n\u201cIt will remain as a very important division of VEDP,\u201d Moret said.\n\nIn fact, he said, the agency is working to expand that area so it has adequate staff to help more companies in the international arena. A 2015 Virginia Chamber of Commerce study found that between 2009 and 2014, 30 percent of the state\u2019s job creation was related to exports.\n\nThe agency operates offices in the United Kingdom, China, Japan and India.\n\nAnother key area for the VEDP will be to work closely with community colleges and technical schools to create customized worker-training programs for in-demand jobs, Moret said, adding that companies\u2019 site selections often hinge on having a skilled local workforce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not currently a leader in state workforce development programs,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong Moret\u2019s overarching goals are to see the state add 75,000 jobs annually and to position every region of Virginia for economic growth.\n\nThough some lawmakers reacted with alarm when the 2016 audit was released, they now seem optimistic about the VEDP\u2019s reboot.\n\n\u201cI believe the VEDP is now functioning efficiently under its new leadership,\u201d Delegate John O\u2019Bannon III, R-Henrico, a member of the Appropriations Committee, told Watchdog.org in an email. \u201cI am confident they will meet the JLARC recommendations and are well prepared to improve Virginia\u2019s economic outlook.\u201d\n\nDuVal, the chamber president, said the VEDP, chamber and the Virginia Tech School of Business are currently working together to evaluate the state\u2019s competitiveness and national business climate rankings, which have slipped somewhat in recent years. A report on how the state can improve the rankings will be released Dec. 1, he said.\n\nDuVal expects the chamber and VEDP to continue working cooperatively in the years to come.\n\n\u201cThe new leadership has brought the right vision and organization,\u201d he said.", "description": "Virginia\u2019s top economic development agency is reorganizing itself in the .09/02/2019 3:22:31AM EST.", "authors": ["Michael Carroll", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
