REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nO\u2019Leary, whose low-fare model has squeezed less competitive rivals, said the tour operator model was \u201cdead\u201d and Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse last week was no surprise.\n\nHe said that some responsibility lay with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for granting Thomas Cook a license to operate without demanding more proof that they would survive.\n\n\u201cHow you can license Thomas Cook in April as fit to fly for another 12 months and then it goes bust in September. (It) is something the CAA needs to address,\u201d O\u2019Leary said at a Reuters Newsmaker event in London.\n\n\u201cThe CAA should be much more aggressive in requiring the shareholders of those companies to put up much more cash to get through the year, rather than allowing them to continually fail.\u201d\n\nThe CAA could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s UK airline immediately folded when the company went into administration, although its German Condor airline is still flying and has been offered a bridging loan by the German government. Thomas Cook\u2019s Scandinavian airline is also still flying.\n\nO\u2019Leary speculated that Germany\u2019s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) might ultimately buy Condor, whose CEO on Tuesday said that there would eventually be a new owner of the airline, according to Die Zeit.\n\nHe also said that Ryanair is not interested in Condor. However, he said he was talking to leasing companies about taking on Thomas Cook\u2019s Airbus (AIR.PA) planes for Ryanair group\u2019s Lauda airline, and could take on some of the travel group\u2019s pilots if they could be trained by next summer.\n\nO\u2019Leary said the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX in March, following two fatal crashes, had hampered Ryanair\u2019s ability to grow quickly to take advantage of the opportunities from Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. He added that Ryanair now hoped its 737 Max orders would be fulfilled for next summer.\n\nWith 135 of the Boeing jets on order and 75 options, Ryanair is one of Boeing\u2019s (BA.N) biggest customers for the latest 737.\n\n\u201cIt will slow down our growth in summer 2020, which is a pity,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\n\n\u201cWhen opportunities come up like the failure of Thomas Cook... we want to be able to grow faster,\u201d he said. \u201cBut safety is the first priority.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary said that while it was easy to point at management when a company fails, Thomas Cook\u2019s problems ran deeper than the current board as the company\u2019s whole business model was fundamentally outdated.\n\n\u201cThe package market I think is screwed, it\u2019s over. It\u2019s like whoever was making shoes for horses when there were horse-drawn carriages,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere were some good, well-managed horse-shoe companies but ultimately they went the same way as well and that will happen with tour operators here in Europe.\u201d", "description": "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary slammed Britain's aviation regulator on Tuesday, saying its soft licensing rules contributed to the chaos around Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435819859&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902BK", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
