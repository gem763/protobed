Kennedy Center named its prestigious award.\n\nA D.C. native, Mr. Chappelle attended a magnet school named for another performing artist and native son, Duke Ellington.\n\nTo his credit, Mr. Chappelle\u2019s standup routines about the so-called cancel culture on Netflix\u2019s \u201cSticks & Stones\u201d special has a lot of eyeballs rolling.\n\nGive him and public schools a hand, because much is \u2014 and will become \u2014 history.\n\nNow let\u2019s be frank in the here and now.\n\nThe other day Meghan McCain, daughter of the late great John McCain, said on her daily talkfest \u201cThe View\u201d: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a gun-grabber, you don\u2019t get my vote. Period. \u2026 I\u2019m not living without guns. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nHmm.\n\nMiss McCain is her father\u2019s daughter when it comes to Second Amendment rights. Good for her.\n\nThe thing is that she could indeed live the rest of her life without handling a gun. Her dad certainly did after he was captured and tortured as a POW during the Vietnam War. For 5\u00bd years. Without a gun.\n\nAlso on \u201cThe View\u201d this week, Whoopi Goldberg gave \u201cWill & Grace\u201d a brief lesson in blacklisting. The actors who portray the namesakes of the hit NBC show, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, took to Twitter to urge spies to make a list of Trump supporters and donors.\n\nMiss Goldberg rightly compared their messaging to the Hollywood \u201cblacklist,\u201d which ostracized prominent artists, producers and directors for being or allegedly being communist or socialist activists and sympathizers.\n\nWhile Hollywood tried to make up (or should that be \u201ckiss up?\u201d) with the 2015 film \u201cTrumbo,\u201d one of Tinseltown\u2019s highest-paid screenwriters, a blockbuster the film was not.\n\nMiss Goldberg\u2019s comments, however, were spot on\n\n\u201cWe had something called a blacklist and a lot of really good people were accused of stuff,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNobody cared whether it was true or not. They were accused. And they lost their right to work,\u201d continued the humorist, who won a KenCen Mark Twain award in 2001. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the right! In this country, people can vote for who they want to. That is one of the great rights of this country.\u201d\n\nOnly suckers would do what Miss Messing and Mr. McCormick apparently would not, and that\u2019s buy their own tickets and do their own spying.\n\nAfter all, the fundraiser is scheduled to be held on Emmy night \u2014 when the glitz, glam and red carpets roll out to honor their ilk.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
