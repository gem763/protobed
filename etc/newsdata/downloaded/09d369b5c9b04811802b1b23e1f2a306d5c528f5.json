The bill, passed by the House in May but stalled in the Senate, seeks to balance the scales for the LGBTQ+ community in all parts of public and commercial life, including housing, employment, credit, education and government-funded programs. The Trump administration opposes it.\n\nThe plan by Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would add a third, non-binary gender option, \u201cX,\u201d to the U.S. passport program, following a wave of states that have updated their driver\u2019s licenses to include the new category.\n\nHe also vows to rescind the Trump administration\u2019s restriction on transgender military service, which took effect in April. The policy bars any openly transgender or transitioning person from enlisting, and discharges those already in the military who openly identify themselves as such.\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images\n\nAccording to a Public Religion Research Institute poll conducted the month the rule was implemented, 63% of Americans supported transgender military service. Those agreeing included 47% of the Republicans surveyed \u2015 a 10% uptick from the organization\u2019s findings in August 2017.\n\nOn health care, the Medicare for All Who Want It plan Buttigieg previously unveiled would provide coverage of gender-affirming treatments and surgical procedures, which currently may not be covered depending on the type of insurer and the state in which a patient is enrolled in coverage. Though the Affordable Care Act outlaws health insurance discrimination based on gender identity, legal fights have ensued at state and local levels over the matter.\n\nIncluded in Buttigieg\u2019s health care proposal would be coverage of pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, the drug that protects high-risk individuals from contracting HIV.\n\nData released earlier this year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that in 2017, only 35% of gay and bisexual men at risk of HIV were using PrEP, a number the agency said was \u201ctoo low.\u201d Overall, according to the federal government, \u201cof the estimated 1 million Americans at substantial risk for HIV and who could benefit from PrEP, less than 1 in 4 are actually using this medication.\u201d\n\nA major complication is that PrEP, branded as Truvada and manufactured by Gilead Sciences, can cost up to $2,000 per month. The federal government has attempted to obtain patents for the drug, spurring a challenge in August by Gilead.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s Becoming Whole initiative sets a goal of ending HIV/AIDS by 2030. While that goal has also been adopted by Trump, in 2018, the president fired all members of his HIV/AIDS council who hadn\u2019t already resigned in protest of his health policies, virtually shuttering operations for more than a year. New staffers were not announced until March.\n\nFurther signaling a lack of attention to the epidemic, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy has been inactive, having had no director since Amy Lansky stepped down in 2017. Buttigieg pledged to revitalize the office as president.\n\nThe release of his expansive list of initiatives comes as he prepares to join eight other Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night for CNN\u2019s LGBTQ town hall in Los Angeles; others slated to appear include former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was scheduled to participate in the forum, but canceled after suffering a heart attack last week. He is expected to return to the campaign trail soon.", "description": "The Democratic presidential contender aims to revamp health care, tackle HIV/AIDS and overturn the transgender military ban.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cfced210000420733eba0.jpeg?cache=swutzjmv0v&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
