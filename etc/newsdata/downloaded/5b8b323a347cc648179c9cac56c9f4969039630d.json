Among the indomitable little Gaulish village and its familiar people is a new character called Adrenaline with red hair, gold headphones and teenage surliness. She is the daughter of Gaul chieftain Vercingetorix.\n\nFor all that we love it, it\u2019s hard to deny that original creators Goscinny and Uderzo had displayed a very limited understanding of women. They come in two types: long haired, voluptuous sirens like Panacea or Mrs Geriatrix or even Cleopatra, or joy killing, bossy wives like Impedimenta. In fact, Asterix and the Secret Weapon actively made fun of feminism. Bravura stirred up the village with talk of women\u2019s liberation, only to turn the village into a giant mall for clothes and makeup. Some might quibble that Asterix was never about nuanced characterisation. But while young readers can chortle at the various kinds of goofy male characters, they are being trained to see women solely in ridiculing ways.\n\nHowever, Asterix has long gone past its creators. Rene Goscinny died in 1977, Alberto Uderzo has retired, and the series has been taken over by Jean-Yves Ferri and Didier Conrad. There\u2019s no reason to cling to crusty old stereotypes. Asterix has done teenage rebellion before \u2013 remember JustforKix? The question is whether Adrenaline remains a figure of fun to be ultimately rescued by Asterix and Obelix, or if she gets to be a hero too. By Toutatis, that can\u2019t be too hard to do.", "description": "Asterix, the beloved children\u2019s comic, is changing its ways after 60 years, with a female hero.
