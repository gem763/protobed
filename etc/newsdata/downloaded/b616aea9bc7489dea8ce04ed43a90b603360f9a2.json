Here\u2019s Why.", "language": "en", "text": "The city\u2019s law, passed in December 2017, was sponsored by Melissa Mark-Viverito, then the Council speaker. It prohibited consumers from being charged \u201cfor services intended to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d and created a $1,000 fine for each violation.\n\nIn January, the Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based group, filed a lawsuit challenging the law on the grounds that it violated free speech, suggesting that the measure was \u201cthe first in the nation to censor speech\u201d between counselors and adult patients.\n\n\u201cThis law was a textbook violation of free speech and the right of individuals to pursue the lives and identities they want to exercise,\u201d said Roger Brooks, a senior lawyer for the group, which says its mission is to defend religious freedom.\n\n\u201cWe went in with confidence that the courts would agree with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis move by the city suggests that on mature consideration, they think that would be the outcome as well.\u201d\n\nMedical professional organizations have long denounced the practice of conversion therapy. The American Psychological Association found in a 2009 report that the practice does not work and that \u201cindividuals experienced harm\u201d from the therapy. The therapy is also predicated on the false notion that L.G.B.T. sexual orientation is a mental disorder.\n\nIndividuals who are \u201cdistressed by their sexual orientation\u201d say that they benefit \u201cwhen offered interventions that emphasize acceptance, support and recognition of important values and concerns,\u201d according to the report.\n\nEighteen states, the District of Columbia and more than 50 municipalities have passed conversion therapy bans for minors, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights. That still has not stopped the therapy from happening.", "description": "The City Council fears that if a federal lawsuit challenging the ban were to reach the Supreme Court, the panel could issue a ruling that protected the practice.", "authors": ["Jeffery C.
