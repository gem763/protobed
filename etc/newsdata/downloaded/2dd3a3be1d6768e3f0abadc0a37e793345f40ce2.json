I\u2019m also fat. Several months ago, she asked me why I have \u201ca big belly.\u201d I had prepared myself for that question, casually said \u201csome people have big bellies and some people have small bellies,\u201d and moved on. Unfortunately, that was not the end of it. Almost every time I see her now, she brings up my belly and wants to laugh about it. Sometimes she points out my belly and laughs and tells me it is big (thanks, I hadn\u2019t noticed!), or she laughs and tells me I have a baby in my belly (and laughingly argues when I correct her), or she throws herself into my stomach and \u201cbounces\u201d off like it is a game. I usually just try not to react, and I have tried to be thick-skinned, but I am embarrassed and have begun dreading seeing her. I have briefly explained twice that some people do not like to talk about their bodies because they are private \u2014 thinking this lesson can extend to any physical \u201cdifference\u201d that might cause comment \u2014 but that has not worked. What can I say to her (and how) that puts an end to this problem without making too big of a deal about it? This has been going on for months and brushing it off is not working.", "description": "From a recent online discuss, Meghan Leahy explains what is going on when a 5-year-old laughs about her aunt's body, and what to do about it.", "authors": ["Meghan Leahy"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/joz5lC9SFHp2-qENW1FnpRtMYnU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UE2FBJHPNEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
