Jo Stark, who recently moved to Cornwall, found a photo of her grandmother sitting at the park which is believed to have been taken in the mid-1930s\n\n'Water was pumped from the village into a large tank above Tivoli Park in the woods, where it was then piped off to the water features.\n\n'The pond at the northern end of the park with its cascading waters, ornamental urns and large obelisks on each side was a showpiece for visitors to admire.\n\n'Whilst the large octagonal pool at the southern end of the park with its extravagant fountain was designed for people to paddle in during the hot days of summer.\n\nThe ruins of the park, pictured, are now abandoned and mostly covered in leaves and soil\n\nFrank Parkyn cleared a large area of woodland and built ornate structures when building the park after he visited the famous Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen\n\n'There were even changing rooms, believed to be dated 1923, so that visitors were encouraged to don their swimwear and take the plunge.'\n\nAccording to the Lerryn History Society, Tivoli Park's architect, Frank Parkyn, was born in the village in 1850 to Maragret and Francis Parkyn.\n\nBy the time he reached 30 years old, he was registered as being a China Clay manufacturer employing 29 men and four boys.\n\nHe decided to create Tivoli Park to give something back to Lerryn and the village's regatta after making his fortune in the China Clay industry.\n\nThe arches were near the entrance to Tivoli Park, at the opposite end to the octagonal pool\n\nLerryn is a small village in Cornwall, known for hosting the popular event Lerryn Regatta, once known as 'The Henley of the West', until 1968\n\nMr Martin added: 'Visitors to the park would get to it through a grand entrance by the riverside, climbing up steps past trees and into the long clearing in the woods.\n\n'There, they were greeted by a 200 metre running track stretching down to a bandstand and the octagonal pool with its ornate centrepiece at the southern end.\n\n'In fact, though the structures may have looked ornate from a distance, they were all rather crudely built out of concrete, and decorated with broken pieces of granite.'\n\nParkyn created Tivoli because he wanted to give Lerryn something back after making a fortune in the China Clay industry\n\nNear the entrance to Tivoli Park, at the opposite end to the octagonal pool, there were arches with water cascading down steps into a pond with a smaller fountain in the middle.\n\nLast year, Jo Stark, who had recently moved to Cornwall, went to visit Lerryn, knowing that her great, great grandparents had lived there and that her grandmother used to love visiting them there.\n\nOn a walk through the woods by the village, she stumbled across the ruins of Tivoli Park.\n\nMs Stark also found this photo of her grandmother and great grandmother (in black) sat at what was initially used as a bandstand in Tivoli Park\n\nMs Stark then searched through her grandmother's old photos and found one of her sat at the cascading water feature at the north end of the park, believed to have been taken in the mid-1930s.\n\nShe also found a photo of her grandmother and great grandmother (in black), sat at what was initially used as a bandstand in Tivoli Park.\n\nIt is believed that, in the end, the bandstand was eventually deemed impractical by those who performed within it, and so it was planted with roses instead.", "description": "The Tivoli Park in the village of Lerryn, Cornwall, opened to the public in 1922 and provided a venue for the annual event Lerryn Regatta.
