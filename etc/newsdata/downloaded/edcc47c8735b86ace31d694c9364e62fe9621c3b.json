McCourt told reporters that the forthcoming options product would allow market participants to be more precise in how they gain exposure to Bitcoin and manage its price risks:\n\n\u201cWhile futures give you a one-for-one exposure, whereby the movement of the underlying bitcoin translates directly to a specific dollar value per contract, an option gives you varying strike-price levels and can give you either downside protection, or upside exposure at a fraction of the underlying price.\u201d\n\nAs distinct from futures, options contracts allow traders to purchase a right to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) a given asset at a specified \u201cstrike price\u201d determined on or before the contract\u2019s expiration date.\n\nMcCourt noted that options would likely enable Bitcoin miners to more accurately hedge the costs of their production. He also pointed to how the current trading of Bitcoin futures contracts among China-based miners has offered them a hedge during volatile times on spot markets.\n\nCME\u2019s evolving Bitcoin derivatives market\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported previously, CME Group announced its Bitcoin options plan in September, revealing its intent to launch the product in the first quarter of 2020, pending regulatory review.\n\nYear to date, 7,000 CME Bitcoin futures contracts \u2014 equivalent to roughly 35,000 BTC \u2014 were reportedly traded on average each day.\n\nOn May 13, a record daily volume of 33,677 contracts \u2014 equivalent to over 168,000 BTC \u2014 was traded on the exchange.\n\nThis fall, industry commentators have closely eyed what many perceive to be the sluggish uptake of Bakkt\u2019s newly-launched Bitcoin futures contracts \u2014 the first of their kind to be physically settled in Bitcoin \u2014 which went live on Sept. 22.", "description": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group expects to see high demand in Asia for its forthcoming Bitcoin options product", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNGYwYmZhYTU0YWU2YTk5OTg2MmEzZjk0ZmNjNWVhMDIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
