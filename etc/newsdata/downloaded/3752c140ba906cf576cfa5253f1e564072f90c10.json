And around the country a lot of people taking in John these major developments involving the president just held a press conference. In New York on this impeachment inquiry that was opened this week let's listen to the president a short time ago responded to the question about whether or not it was appropriate. To make the request he did of the Ukrainian. President tables. Is she said we were I was ambushed I was in push meaning pressured US impression at all. But I don't like the concept of releasing calls because. When a president or prime minister or king or queen calls the United States you're going to say she would get a release your call to. The fake news media and they're gonna make you look like a fool. What happens is it's hard to do business that way. And the president not. Answering Steve Holland's question as to whether or not it was appropriate why. He he asked the president of Ukraine Johnny was also given hypothetically said would have been okay. If President Obama had say asked a foreign leader to dig up dirt on you he said. Passion that's what happened but of course is no evidence Canada and that did not happen. And so let's make that very clear first and foremost so OK moving on an American presidency very angry there well listen he's got a lot of problems now he's been up in new York and Washington is going to welcome him at the open arms of impeachment series and that's what they really. Gotta gear up for and I do think one of the things that weeping hear from the White House over the last couple hours here. Is that light mostly people over 16100 were for the president we really know a lot until we saw the transcript it sounds like there were briefings that we're going on. About this transcript and actually going on giving people the document calling them read it for themselves. Now in its LP are there are many people that we're telling hospital last few days this is not so bad. Now they're saying. Loses lots of problems here there are some issues and it's going to be curious that DeVon how they're going to actually restructure how wrenching and create. A teen to deal with this yeah both sides here in this political fight taking some risks in the past 44 hours Nancy Pelosi announcing the formal impeachment. Inquiry against president trump the president taking the extraordinary step of really seen eight confidential classified. Rough transcript. Of his conversation. With the Ukrainian president and here are some of the headlines. A John let's break these down from this five page document of a thirty minute conversation. At these two men had back in July some extraordinary stuff here. Yes so of course the president of course pushing the Ukrainian president to investigate Joseph Biden. The president himself brings out Biden before the Ukrainian leader does that we have that the president offered to have attorney John general bill Barr. To assist in that inquiry brings up several times it has one meaning that when we're reporting this out of last several days. We didn't know that bill borrowers a part of this conversation obviously now from seeing document. So it is of course you do have the DOJ their criminal division DeVon they've reviewed. The whistle blower complaint but did not pursue it but now that is going to be quite curious. Where that goes next because we know congress just a couple in the last few hours members of congress will be given a view only. You only version of that complaint we believe they're gunning at a copy tumor king tomorrow. When that whistle blower is going to get set to eventually go out Capitol Hill but first we're going here tomorrow. In front a Capitol Hill from the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. And this is the person who. Initially at least it sounds like block it's release of this transcript. Are an a complaint rather tuned to the congress. This is the person that whistle blower that set this whole thing into motion a week ago it has so quickly. Developed over over that at that time for a lot of people still trying to put their minds around what has happened after two years John on the mall our investigation we never reached this point and now we have a majority. House Democrats almost the threshold of two ET harmony discount that say they would vote for impeachment of the president before even begun the formal here. And I eat and I think on this one many fuel mean the point this is a little more. Understandable. And smaller pro break because there were so many tentacles what was going on Robert dollars investigation. About obstruction of justice collusion. What was Russia's involvement with the trump campaign 2016 what actions the president taking. When he assumed office but a lot of different dots to connect. This is pretty clean cut to a degree. You have a phone conversation. The president having it over reached seeking direct theme at a political rival. That something that everybody can understand for the most part but what's going to be curious now is it as this investigation starts to grow as these committees really get to work. It's going to be curious what the timeline of events looks like here. What actions may or may have been taken by other members of the administration or allies of the president around this phone. And the president of course are already serving to show his strategy in all this pivot pivot pin it keep the attention. I'm Joseph Biden not a lot of evidence there to back up similar claims that he's making but he's hoping. As he did is back and torn 152016 states with the with the birth or theories to keep the attention on these questions around his rivals. To fire up his base as well we do know that all of this this approach is rallying. I've Republicans for the most part the of unified around president from trump ally senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had this to say. About the phone call that came out today. Phone call to me wasn't nothing wrong I talk to us this morning has advised president. Prop up apology for policing the transcript he's worried about the chilling effect it will land. Future conversations I think we should all be worried about that I told him. This president the desire to get use and he. They were calling for your impeachment before they even knew what was in the phone call Reza phone call. I was quite frankly impressed with the fact that you would release it in the phone call speaks for itself. What's his mood and impeachment. This I think's done. It's just so stunning you know listen lag cover that campaign. Are going to be tunnels from giving out Lindsey Graham cellphone number and taking your demon and now you've Lindsey Graham has been the trump defender about capital circle its criteria is but one person. That we've seen so far be the only crack in the Republican ceiling here and that is senator Mitch Romney he is said that it's these are allegations presented in this transcript they're quite concerning and matters that do need to be looked. And all of this of course can be rapidly developing out over the fall here as we go forward to Republican now opposition notwithstanding Nancy Pelosi making their -- move very quickly counseled about how do you where this goes from here what's next in this impeachment process security ABC news live we've put together a handy. Flow chart for you to help sort of visualize what this process to look like the speaker says she wants to get this done John by the end of the year. Yeah well good a good luck let's hope it works Californians duplicity but here's the road maps so we have six committees that are going to start doing some work some are already. Been very aggressive like House Intelligence Committee and the House Judiciary Committee the other four committees have been doing work is well but not the level and the speed that Pelosi and the leadership oneself. Once those committees finish their work they have to submitted for review to the House Judiciary Committee the House Judiciary Committee. Well then make a recommendation and vote on articles of impeachment. That will go to the full floor of that house. They need the majority you mentioned to him right now just with the Democrats they are not far they need the magic number of 218. To get that simple majority then what happens we go across the hall to Mitch McConnell house that is the senate and that's where a trial would occur. On this now. That's where it's going to be quite curious because in the house obviously Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat they have full control there over in the senate it is a Republican ball games silly will be curious to see what actions Mitch McConnell will take. Will they actually bring it to a trial will only bring it to a vote. It is is a very long time and we're not there yet we first have to see what happens in the house and Bob. Bob members on both sides of the aisle really asking what is this gonna accomplish what's it can achieve Howard and explain to the American people. Why we're gonna go through this process since at the end of the business see John over in the senate it's very unlikely. That this is gonna go anywhere against president from bar Capitol Hill reporter Catherine fall there's. Is on the beach she's out there on Capitol Hill have been covering this story today Catherine so explain to us what you're hearing about what's next. A yet that is a she's doing us a little differently than impeachment in the past they have begun with. A vote on the house floor but what she dead as you mentioned as announced a formal impeachment inquiry and tasks of the six chairs the who are. Investigating this president with continuing to do their work investigating an and then through sources my understanding is that that evidence that they have they will then. Turn over two House Judiciary Committee chaired by chairman now mark Hilan and make a determination based on that evidence accident. A horror articles. Of impeachment. To the house floor and chosen timeline obviously this is still bid up the airman and hearing that hopefully they're hoping that this will get done. Before the end of the. And we will see if that voters tell these two orders eighteen votes a simple majority to pass Kevin Paul there's thank you for that let's bring in now an expert. I'm the impeachment process Margaret Taylor. A friend of the briefing room over the Brookings Institution around the corner here also a senior editor at the laughter blog. Martyred thank you so much for coming ensor where do we go from here. With impeachment it sort of seems to me like we already have the votes that this is. You know there's really no investigating needed right I mean Democrats could do this tomorrow if they wanted to. On the chin that's true in terms then get the number of house Democrats that have said they there's. I think something like 200 in and tan that said they favor a an impeachment inquiry. Whether all of those folks would say yes they favor actual impeachment this point I think is a different question. On the bike it's I think it's a little bit hard to see exactly how it unfolds. On as you said before a number of different committees have been tasked to do further investigation and and send that information to the Judiciary Committee. And then turning Nadler we'll have the job of co leading all of that information deciding what types of articles of impeachment the Judiciary Committee is going to vote on. The vote on them and then after that there would be house floor vote. I do think there is this question on timing. You know if there's going to be months and months of investigation and bath one thing if the if Nancy closings looking to really move quickly that would be a different thing I do think that this call man now and potentially the testimony tomorrow. Could speed up that timeline potentially because this is some pretty. Pretty kind of amazing explosive stuff in my view in particular in this column I'll and we'll have to wait and see. Whether it V that committee gets awful. On whistled our complaint. Yeah exactly we understand that some of that's been transmitted to the hill this afternoon we should say our whip count your point now Margaret is at about 205 house Democrats. So far have come out publicly supporting the inquiry different and supporting a vote. On impeachment of course and to get to that point but some of our viewers asking assertion medium Barger. What would this do what does it mean if they do hold a vote it people remember the Clinton impeachment. But what would this do for president trump if if Nancy Pelosi holds this vote by the end of the year in May do impeach and so what. So if if he is impeached then the whole matter what gets kicked over into the senate. For an actual trial in the senate about whether to convict. The president on the the articles I been impeached on so that's a whole separate process and it's very unclear right now how that might play out in the future. As folks said earlier. Senate Republicans at least for the most part at this when time. Seems to be filled defending the president. Or at least saying you know this way is inappropriate but not necessarily impeachable so we'll just have to watch and see. Howell bat. Unfolds over time in particular. If and he house investigations. Reveal a larger picture a bigger picture about the conduct that the president. Has been involved in in about in addition conduct that Philip like bill Bart may have been involved in. He's got to pay low profile so far on that from Barbara Taylor thank you so much for your time for coming over. Speaking of significant and would be significant if Republicans. Any Republicans broke. And went in favor the closest one Jack Mitt Romney perhaps predictable today he danced close to the line of saying that this. Could be an impeachable offense let's listen to it and richer action. My reaction was the same as I had a few days ago which is this remains deeply troubling. And we'll see where it leads but. First reaction is troubling that the president states asks or presses the leader of a foreign country. To carry out an investigation of a political nature that's troubling and and I feel that. And so. Cliff cliff there were a quid pro quo that would that ticket to an entirely. That. More extreme level. Cartoons Mitt Mitt Romney there beginning the most critical we've seen any Republican to present Jack I mean. For comparison purposes looking back at the Clinton impeachment. When we got close on Nixon. Worrying UV DC. Party the president. Was there where we're or support at that time also. You know the end for Nixon was when. His Republicans came to him and said Democrats we can't help you in the dam broke and he had to resign. But for Clinton's that is democratic allies stayed with him and stuck Wenham all the way through. They appeared on the White House lawn after that. A vote was taken. Standing shoulder to shoulder with the president and today it because he'd survived and even though he was impeached the senate did not convict and he had survived south. You know if it. We've improved for Mitt Romney effort you know he didn't support the president ms. candidacy but. Then will he used came to his side had dinner with the news that possibly even considered. Turn to work in the administration. You know. He's he's been. On again off again. And in terms of the support let's get to hear from you. They now are Patrick rebel joins us live I at this hour from Kiev Ukraine Patrick great to see you've been in some great reporting over there that's a start. What what is the view from Ukraine right now what are people talking about over there in the media and you're hearing from officials there with some. Reaction to this drama. Science for the officials obviously this is not a comfortable positions again they really some stuck between a rock and heartless and a place that really really don't want to be reasonably feel they run the risk of iron that. Of sitting president trump or upsetting the potentially the next. Present at the US if it happens it Democrat. As they they feel that basically that best nick can do is say absolutely nothing which is well president's views than the day. Desperately trying to do well the city but he's huge crowds of journalists. Son's face who we're hearing is that you know they really wish they would not in this position. Purpose that is when he found themselves. It sure is and their spent so much talk now about the corruption in Ukraine Patrick here we're learning. The American people are really learning for the first time some in the detail. About the Ukrainian government. And you have been the troubles there president trump trying to spin this. As he is used trying to do his part to shut down the carpet. Kids give us sort of a big picture sense of the history. In a nutshell. Or corruption in Ukraine in house Lewinsky is really political outsider that day came in term vowing to clean this up right. Yeah that that's true this very much how he was appointed I think I don't know what's understand really is story you do have to know update about Ukraine in particular that I think a lot of people are wondering is when they they hear it. The warning what is that this allegation that is being made that the that present job is trying to get investigated and whether it's legitimate. And so in as one of the things that we've been trying to look at flowing in here. Is that we have been trying to took about it the allegation that the Joseph Biden. I'm forced out this prosecutor is news this afternoon foursome out of out of his position in order to protect his son. I'm and what we're hearing here is really that the facts just don't support that timeline you know just don't support that theory. Basically him not because from what we have been told by officials and not say including by officials who actually in the office. All this prosecuted that in fact this prosecutor was not making any kind of attempt to protect two rutz who investigate. I'm accompanied it was connected would you Biden's son hunts have been fact that actually stole this investigation is opposite actually south at times the investigation. And so what we're saying is that in fact Joseph Biden wants to protect his son that would have it would be being quite strange veterans who have forced out this prosecuted. I'm and you know really what we're finding is that. Bosnian he would that the sources well these allegations that every Giuliani has played such a big role in pushing it. When it wins allegations come from the came from another prosecutor general issue who has fire president's given the summit. I'm as they Missouri the Sankoh and basically will what he bases these allegations that the Biden. You know five has prosecuted six sun initially came from this man I was talking to an official inside. The inside the sank his office inside as prosecutor general's office is said to me that actually. Everyone knows that in fact. The reason this this prosecuted gave this information he gave does not seem to Giuliani was that it was politically motivated from his perspective and that it was because actually. This man is saying it believed the under is an ST QB five. I'm an eventful he needed. To try and get the US. It's trying on his side and help them and it sounds like they're slightly crazy scheme and a fact that's how it's perceived by most of the Ukrainian officials were talking to. I'm and it was seen as a desperate bid by this prosecutor. To try and trying to US involved in Ukrainian politics and what remarkably it's happens that she rebounded the other way. Let's have this really I'm totally unexpected impacts and now we have impeachment proceedings going on yes president of the United States. Yeah it and what a complicated. Picture for people to try to digest as well I think this is going to be a really tough one. As its litigated in the media Jack because the president we know is gonna go on the offensive. We know the RNC is are you doing at the trump campaign is doing its spinning trying to put chum in the water about what Patrick's talking about with. Former vice president Joseph Biden's son. Spending time over there in Ukraine he was in fact on the board of of an oil company brewery is not wild. Joseph Biden was vice president that all is true. But but as Patrick has reporters here so smartly Ed the actual reason that Joseph Biden. As they went and had diplomats for the Obama administration and Ukraine is pushing for the ouster of that prosecutor. Wasn't because necessarily because he was trying to help his son but rather because it was part of a global effort at the time to of root out. The root out corruption and actually pursue further investigation. Charisma because this guy was sitting on the sidelines. Exactly so you don't be it appears that either the international community wanted this. Investigator this prosecutor gone and in Kenya and Joseph Biden in the US joined that chorus of people saying hey get rid of this cut and. We can't say no it can't we that the optics probably weren't very good to know former vice president at the time. Because he did there are these facts that that are out there they don't look so great right for Joseph Biden right now Hunter Biden was on the board was making a lot of money in the Ukraine. And at the same time. From the former vice president Reza lobbying to get rid of this process. Also pleased may have some bearing and I'm Joseph Biden's political future. But there's also a set of facts here. That. Are or are really unit. Because some heartburn some Maalox moments over at the White House Counsel's Office in dealing. With what's in this transcript right if it's her big complicated picture of the facts you Patrick because. I was also struck by some in your reporting talking to aides presidents Lewinsky about this phone call. And the military aid that was withheld we heard so when ski today say he felt no pressure from president trump. No big deal. But you've heard from people close to the present and there that actually the whole. Pretext for having a phone call was that there were had to be some sort of guarantee that Joseph Biden. Could have been a point of discussion. Yeah exactly I was the name yet been advised that the president's rescue earlier today and he does it is that it was clear to people in his circled arts of the Nazi was elected they've won its a conversation with trump you know once again how open will. As many years do. But that they caps understood that they kept finding and it was that they understood that. The only way they're gonna have this cool was if they agreed to bring up Joseph Biden and that there's they basically perceived it as as a precondition for this coal. I'm immensely they spoke and obviously as renowned they spoke about fighting. And the way that this discernment buys that put it was essentially that you know the ukrainians decided. Well we have to kind of just yet he's gonna bring it up. And we just have to trying to be as neutral as possible weapons and say we'll look into its effects that that was the position that they and that's an it position they would like to be public as well now this. And and that they have not has started actual investigation. As we understand are very Patrick. Yes. Not only have they not sign it wants us understand you will lose all the people who I've been talking to. They seem to say it's it's it's not possible rating to stun investigation because as his or descend the timeline doesn't work. I'm under the facts is that I don't fit with it and ultimately the key thing of course is that the with the keep repeating is that if president Chung had a genuine concern about this and knew something about. About a budget Biden. Then why has come US law enforcement made the request is doesn't usually happen why hasn't. Like the normal channels being used to make this formal request Ukraine speaking investigations which is what Nicholas would normally do and say they would be willing to do that if that request came. But of course they say it hasn't. And we should have point out at this point the conversation Patrick thank you that your former vice president Joseph Biden has issued a statement this afternoon. On the substance. Of the president's allegations that we've been talking about here reporting nine in the Ukraine. Here's what that a former vice president had to say and five this have come out in favor of impatience of the house has to do its job and hold down trucker conference abuse of power. I must do mine and remain focused on making my case for revisions of the American presidency you know me. Real help for those who need it in our country Biden has repeatedly dismissed. The allegations surrounding his son he has denied talking. About it his business with charisma Wally was vice president although. He was low on truthful there because he's here's has admitted that he they spoke or editor at least once. And Jack the president signaled today that he's not gonna let up now on this sort of conspiracy with the by NCs and get a maybe focus on what was happening in China. As well. Here and end in you know sort of who you know thanks to question our is that if the US news the president can oppression the Chinese to. Provide information on its political opponent and you know we're headed data really. Just. Very perilous path to the president. We'll have to see where this goes that's. Go back to Patrick Revell one last time Patrick because the final thing I wanted to get your thought on. I was enrolled that Rudy Giuliani the president's personal turning played in all of this we heard are we sought rather in the memo. Outlining this controversial phone call that the Ukrainian president brought up the issue Rudy Giuliani. And prompted him during the call to suggest that he had an end. With someone connected to the White House how is Rudy Giuliani been received over there. It was he seen as simply a private attorney in trying to look into some political dirt or was he seen as an. Official emissary of the White House. Yeah it's interesting as was interesting to see SC in the transcript. Presidents grow enough so readily that's the we'd love him to come. Because last happened in reality. Is that Rudy Giuliani you news and won't say said he was gonna comes Ukraine. I'm and then it was a bit there was a public rule around this you may remember this is that those summit. Man he called off his trip to come head. My presenting credentials Ukrainian officials is that of course they music season. I think representative of of the White House ultimately. And what one thing that was Anderson jobs told that it was that she is that it Rudy Giuliani and being very eager to get. Institute. To get into a meeting with president Kaczynski before he became president that is in between his election but while he was still president elect and one of the reasons they felt that was. Was that once he arrived. Once once that prisons as he had become president any meeting wins Giuliani would have cost you much more formal and would have to be treason is some kind of every he would have been treated as some kind of moral. Formal represented all of the White House and it not only was on the seat Giuliani apparently consent about this that the ukrainians themselves are also. Very wary of finding themselves. Obligated to do something by meeting with a meeting with Giuliani at the same time you know represented all of president is asking you a very senior aided his met with Giuliani in Madrid. Back in July. And it as far as he knows he may have known commit some promises to investigate is this the last that we we know about that meeting. Rudy Giuliani strewn stirred up a lot of Hanks and Capitol Hill freelancing foreign policy of course as we've said earlier not. Holding any official role the United States government so we will see Rebecca us Jack. Patrick rebel live for us from Kiev Ukraine where he's done some terrific reporting I'm more of it. At abcnews.com. And we'll have more from Patrick. Through the week as the story continues to unfold with connections at Ukraine and thank you for watching us here in the briefing room we'll have full coverage of acting DL nine.
