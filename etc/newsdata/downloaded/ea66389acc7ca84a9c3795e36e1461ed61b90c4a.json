The FBI briefed the media yesterday on the history behind the spree that killed seven people in Odessa and Midland. His employer had fired him that day and tried to warn police that the shooter might get violent:\n\nA west Texas man, on a \u201cdownward spiral,\u201d made \u201crambling\u201d calls to police and the FBI before embarking on a shooting spree that took the lives of seven innocent bystanders, authorities said Monday. \u2026 \u201cRight after that firing he called 911 \u2026 and so did his employer,\u201d Odessa police chief Michael Gerke told reporters. \u201cAnd basically they were complaining at each other because they had a disagreement over that firing.\u201d He left his trucking business employer\u2019s office before police showed up.\n\nBy that time, it was too late \u2014 the man had already left. However, he himself called the FBI\u2019s tip line and left a rambling, confused message. The traffic stop was unrelated to either of those calls, but it touched off the man\u2019s violent ambitions. It took more than two hours to track him down in front of a movie theater and kill him to end the mass-murder spree.\n\nThe FBI has not reached a formal conclusion in the case, but it sounds as though they are leaning toward mental illness as the prime factor:\n\nWhile the FBI and police stopped well short of explaining the killer\u2019s motive, they painted a picture of a man who\u2019d been struggling for a long period of time. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strange residence. It\u2019s very small. I can tell you the conditions reflect what we believe his mental state was going into this,\u201d Combs said. \u201cHe was a long spiral of going down. He didn\u2019t wake up Saturday morning and walk into his company and then it happened. He went to that company in trouble, probably been in trouble for a while \u2026 we really need the public\u2019s help to reach out to us when they see people in that downward spiral that may be on that road to violence.\u201d\n\nMental illness appears to be the connecting factor in all of these shootings \u2014 that, and maybe contagion as a contributing factor. One thing that wasn\u2019t a contributing factor was a hole in the background-check process, according to Texas governor Greg Abbott. The shooter had been denied a firearms purchase after he failed a background check a few years ago:\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) tweeted Monday that Ator did not go through a background check when obtaining the gun used in the attacks, which were spread across at least 15 crime scenes. Ator had before failed to pass a check with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System while trying to buy a gun, said John Wester, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent. Years earlier, Ator had been charged with criminal trespass and evading arrest, according to a public records search. His previous interactions with Odessa police were minor, Gerke said.\n\nThis will lead to a question that has repeatedly arisen in the background-check debate. Did anyone follow up to prosecute Ator for attempting to illegally purchase a firearm? In the current system, those follow-up investigations are exceedingly rare even though it is a crime for prohibited people to attempt to purchase a firearm by any means. Rather than expand background checks, opponents argue, law enforcement should start by enforcing that existing law first. At the very least, that might uncover the mentally unstable long before they begin shooting sprees.", "description": "\"He was a long spiral of going down.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/texas-gunman-spiral.png"}
