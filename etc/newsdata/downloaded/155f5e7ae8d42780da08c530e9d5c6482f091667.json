Such behavior would also \u201cconstitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nAny effort by Sec. Pompeo to intimidate or prevent witnesses from testifying will add to evidence that the Trump Admin is obstructing Congress.\n\n\n\nGiven Pompeo's own potential role in the affair, it will also create the inference that he is trying to cover up illicit activity. https://t.co/rtniky524i \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) October 1, 2019\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 stern warning was written in response to a fiery letter by Pompeo sent earlier in the day to Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn his letter, Pompeo objected to attempts by House committee leaders to depose five current and former State Department officials, arguing that the timeline proposed for the depositions was \u201cunfeasible.\u201d House Democrats were attempting to \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d officials, Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cI will not tolerate such tactics,\u201d he said.\n\nI\u2019m concerned with aspects of the Committee\u2019s request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs. pic.twitter.com/QRtMaXlhQM \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) October 1, 2019\n\nIn their response, Engel, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said it was Pompeo and his department who were employing tactics of intimidation.\n\nThe committee leaders also suggested Pompeo was attempting to \u201ccover up illicit activity and misconduct.\u201d\n\nPompeo \u201cappears to have an obvious conflict of interest,\u201d the chairmen wrote, noting that the secretary of state was reportedly on a July 25 call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump urged Ukraine\u2019s leader to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cIf true, Secretary Pompeo is now a fact witness in the impeachment inquiry. He should not be making any decisions regarding witness testimony or document production in order to protect himself or the president,\u201d the chairmen wrote.\n\n\u201cGiven the Secretary\u2019s own potential role\u2026 the Committees may infer that he is trying to cover up illicit activity and misconduct, including by the President. This would be a blatant cover-up and a clear abuse of power,\u201d they added.", "description": "House committee leaders' letter suggests Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is attempting to \"cover up illicit activity and misconduct.\"", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d940cab2200005100dc1c10.jpeg?cache=g9twgbtqhi&ops=1778_1000"}
