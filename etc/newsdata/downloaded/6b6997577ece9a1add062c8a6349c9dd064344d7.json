I am not commenting on individual candidates for the position of Federal Council Chairperson. The delegates will decide, let's focus on the future.\"\n\nWho are the four people competing for the position?\n\nHelen Zille\n\nZille is the former DA leader and Western Cape province premier. She led the DA between 2007 and 2015.\n\nZille began her career as a journalist for the Rand Daily Mail, where she helped uncover the circumstances leading to the death of Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko in 1977.\n\nShe was previously elected to the Western Cape legislature and thereafter served as a DA MP and Mayor of Cape Town, before serving as premier between 2009 and 2015.\n\nZille joined the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) in July as a senior policy fellow, writer and analyst.\n\nHowever, she suspended her fellowship with the IRR on Friday following her decision to join the contest for the position of chair of the party's federal council.\n\nOn Friday, Zille shared the news on her social media accounts, and said she submitted nomination forms after \"careful consideration and consultation\", and being approached by senior leaders in the week.\n\n\"In recent months, the DA has been through a period of turmoil and distress. As a party, it is important for us to reflect, to introspect and to begin the process of reconnecting with voters,\" Zille said.\n\n\"If elected as Chairperson of the Federal Council, my objective will be to support the leadership in its goal of stabilising the party and getting it back on track.\"\n\nShe said she loved the DA and the values it represented.\n\n\"South Africa cannot succeed unless the DA succeeds. I am prepared to work hard and to play my part in saving our democracy.\"\n\nZille has previously rankled people with some of her tweets.

We are not communicating and connecting with them and we need to focus on that as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nHe said his major focus on his campaign would be to ensure that the party increased its number of seats around the country.\n\n\"I think people are excited about the fact that someone is prepared to stand their grounds in the party and to speak up for what is right in the party and we need more of that... we need more honest people in the party that are prepared to speak up,\" he said.\n\nThomas Walters\n\nWalters is the DA\u2019s acting federal chair.
