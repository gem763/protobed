Thankfully, today it went in the top corner. It is a positive day.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWith the penalty, you always step forward to take it and when the moment comes it is just about trying to be relaxed. Thankfully, today I was. It made the game a little bit easier for us but the second goal was the one that killed the game.\u201d\n\nBefore road wins over Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and now Chelsea, Manchester United had not won away in any competition since the start of March.\n\n\u201cWe have been in a tough place,\u201d Rashford added. \u201cWe are still getting through that phase and the only way to do it is to fight your way through it.\n\n\"The main focus for us is just improvement and development because we are definitely going places. We have done a lot of good work.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"The start of the season wasn\u2019t exactly what we expected but we have got to get through it and get back to winning games.\u201d\n\nThe defeat ends a run of seven consecutive wins for Frank Lampard's side in all competitions.\n\nChelsea boss Lampard said: \u201cThe second goal was just special. It was a bolt out of the blue. No team can stop that. It is great technique.\n\n\"It was a stunning strike at a time where we had just got ourselves level and I thought we were in the ascendancy.\u201d", "description": "Marcus Rashford's long-range missile fired Manchester United past Chelsea and into the Carabao Cup quarter-finals", "authors": ["Neil Mcleman", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761695.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chelsea-FC-v-Manchester-United-Carabao-Cup-Round-of-16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
