Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSuarez moved into a tie for the major league lead with 47 homers, the same as New York Mets rookie Pete Alonso. Suarez has three multi-homer games this season, two against the Diamondbacks in the past eight days. He has five homers against Arizona this season.\n\nBauer (11-12) struck out nine while giving up four hits and one run.\n\nJosh VanMeter also homered for the Reds (70-80), who have won three of their past four games.\n\nKetel Marte had two hits and Wilmer Flores had an RBI single for Arizona (76-74), which has lost seven of eight after breaking a six-game losing streak Saturday.\n\nArizona fell 5 1/2 games behind the Chicago Cubs for the second National League wild-card spot with 12 games remaining and three other teams to pass.\n\nRaisel Iglesias struck out two in a 1-2-3 ninth inning for his 31st save in 36 chances.\n\nArizona right-hander Zac Gallen (3-6) gave up five hits and three runs in 5 2/3 innings, with five strikeouts and two walks. He has given up three or fewer runs in his first 15 major league starts, the second-longest streak to start a career behind Montreal\u2019s Steve Rogers (18, 1973).\n\nArizona\u2019s Alex Avila walked with one out in the third inning, took second on Gallen\u2019s sacrifice bunt and scored on Flores\u2019 single, the first hit of the game. Marte followed with a single, but Flores was thrown out attempting to take third.\n\nVanMeter homered leading off the fourth inning and Suarez followed with a homer on a 3-0 pitch from Gallen for a 2-1 lead. VanMeter has eight homers, two in this series.\n\nSuarez hit his 456-footer for a 3-1 lead in the sixth.\n\nThe Diamondbacks had 12 total hits in the series, losing two of three. In a 1-0 victory Saturday, Arizona became the first team in major league history to win a game in which they had only one baserunner, according to Elias.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Eugenio Suarez hit two solo home runs, including a 456-foot blast, and Trevor Bauer pitched eight strong innings to help the Cincinnati Reds to a 3-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday in Phoenix.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430319918&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F05V-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
