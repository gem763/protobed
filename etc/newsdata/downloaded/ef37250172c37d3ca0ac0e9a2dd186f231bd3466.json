I have never been happier off the court, never been happier on the court.\"\n\nTop seed Dominic Thiem fought back from a set down to reach the final in the men's draw -- and also book his place at the season-ending ATP Finals.\n\nThe Austrian will play third-seeded Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday's decider after beating Russia's Karen Khachanov 2-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 in two hours and 41 minutes. Tsitsipas defeated Alexander Zverev 7-6 (6), 6-4.\n\n\"For me personally, it was one big goal when I started into the season, I'm very, very happy that I made it again,\" said Thiem after reaching the ATP Finals for a fourth time in a row.\n\n\"But it's not because of today's win, it's because of all the season.\"\n\nAlso already qualified for London are Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Daniil Medvedev.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Naomi Osaka said that she had just two hours' sleep before beating title-holder Caroline Wozniacki to sweep into the China Open final on Saturday.
