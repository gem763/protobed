I am very grateful to everyone who supported me - all the Russian citizens who helped and wrote me letters and donated money for my defense,' she said.\n\nLater she told the Kremlin-funded satellite TV station RT that she was not concerned that she had been banned from the US.\n\n'I don't want to go back there in the near future, because if you are a Russian in the United States, you have to worry,' she said.\n\nThe former American University graduate student pleaded guilty last December to conspiring to act as an unregistered agent for Russia.\n\nShe admitted that she and a former Russian lawmaker worked to leverage contacts in the National Rifle Association to pursue back channels to American conservatives.\n\nButina was welcomed home by her father, Valery (right), who made the long trip to Moscow from the family's hometown of Barnaul\n\nButina was given a bouquet of flowers after her arrival at Sheremetyovo Airport on Saturday\n\nRussia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, who also met Butina at the airport, said the 30-year-old is a victim of entrenched anti-Russian attitudes in the United States\n\nRussia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, who also met Butina at the airport, said the 30-year-old is a victim of entrenched anti-Russian attitudes in the United States.\n\n'This is what, unfortunately, the previous US administration started - trying to destroy the bilateral relationship,' spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.\n\nSince the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, Russian officials have consistently blamed the two nations' troubled relations on alleged 'Russophobia' carried over from the administration of Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama.\n\n'She really did no harm to anybody. She's just a girl, she's just a young woman. She tried to invest her youth, if you wish, her gift, her talent, into people-to-people contacts,' Zakharova said.\n\nButina's case was highly criticized in Russia and the foreign ministry underlined that position by using her face as the avatar on its Facebook page.\n\nButina is a pro-gun activist from Russia who infiltrated conservative political circles in the U.S. on behalf of the Kremlin around the 2016 election\n\nThe 30-year-old was convicted of conspiring to act as an unregistered foreign agent and was sentenced to 18 months in prison in April. She had already served nine months in a Virginia detention center following her July 2018 arrest\n\nThat was changed to the Russian double-eagle symbol after her return.\n\nButina violated U.S. law because she did not report her efforts to the Justice Department, which requires the registration of lobbyists and others in the U.S. who do the bidding of foreign governments.\n\nShe was sentenced to 18 months in prison but received credit for time already served.\n\nHer lawyers said Friday that she was not a spy and that the case had nothing to do with espionage or election interference.\n\nThey cast the crime as more technical than substantive.\n\nThe Butina case captivated public attention in the U.S. because it unfolded around the same time as special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference, even though the two probes were entirely separate.\n\nIt also led to scrutiny of the political dealings of the powerful NRA.", "description": "Maria Butina was deported on Friday by the United States after serving a prison sentence, arriving the next day at the Russian capital's Sheremetyevo Airport.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/18/20221318-0-image-a-24_1572110424240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
