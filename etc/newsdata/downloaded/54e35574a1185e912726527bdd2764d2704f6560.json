Ashley has something Johnson lacks: a comfortable majority. He holds more than 60 per cent of the shares.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut the vote still mattered. It gave the company\u2019s independent shareholders a means by which they could offer up a verdict on the quixotic way Ashley has been running the company.\n\nThis year we\u2019ve had delayed results. The company is currently without an auditor and the big four accountants are showing a marked reluctance to tender for the work.\n\nIt\u2019s been gobbling up the high street with wild abandon, but this has led to some serous problems, notably in the case of House of Fraser, the acquisition of which kicked the company in the financial guts. The Belgians, meanwhile, say they\u2019re owed more than \u00a3600m in taxes. The media was barred from the meeting.\n\nVoting advisors have recommended shareholders oppose his reappointment citing multiple governance issues. The shares have been dogs.\n\nI could go on.\n\nAnd yet despite all this a thumping majority of independent investors effectively said, you carry on Mike. We\u2019re ok with this.\n\nIt\u2019s like rebel Tory Dominic Grieve saying to Johnson something like, you know what, forget all that stuff I made a fuss about. You\u2019ve got my vote from here on out regardless of what you do.\n\nThe investment community\u2019s defenders would point to victories they have secured in the past. The much criticised former Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell ultimately resigned despite enjoying the support of Ashley. A past share option scheme for him and other executives was withdrawn.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Ashley train just keeps on running.\n\nThe blas\u00e9 response of a majority of investors towards what\u2019s been going on at the company once again suggests that they are incapable of acting in their own interests, let alone those of other stakeholders, when it comes to the way companies are governed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
