Seeking to persuade reporters on the plane to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that the Houthis could not have been responsible, he said: \u201cWhatever you report about them, you say, \u2018the Houthis said\u2019, [but] you should say, \u2018the well-known, frequently lying Houthis have said the following\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought not report them as if these are truth-tellers, as if these are people who aren\u2019t completely under the boot of the Iranians, and who would not at the direction of the Iranians lay claim to attacks which they did not engage in, which clearly was the case here,\u201d he continued.\n\nRegardless of the Houthis\u2019 own reputation for veracity, the striking aspect of Pompeo\u2019s remarks is the lack of self-awareness. He seems unable to reflect that the man for whom he works lies casually, and almost daily.\n\nIndeed fact-checking Donald Trump has become a minor industry in and of itself. As of 5 August, his 928th day in office, he had made 12,019 false or misleading claims, according to the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker\u2019s database.\n\nThe Post reported \u201cTrump crossed the 10,000 mark on 26 April, and he has been averaging about 20 fishy claims a day since then. From the start of his presidency, he has averaged about 13 such claims a day\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, anyone who followed the 17 days of outright Saudi denials that the journalist Jamal Khashoggi had been killed in its consulate in Istanbul knows that prominent Saudis lie, or in some cases, allow themselves to be misinformed, in the national interest.\n\nIran also enters the court without clean hands. Arguably its specialism is plausible deniability, using surrogates to act on its behalf and on its instruction. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal, for example, stemmed from the exposure of the Iranian state dissembling over the existence of two undeclared nuclear facilities.\n\nSome will say states pursuing the national interest are necessary strangers to truth \u2013 Sir Henry Wotton famously said back in 1604: \u201cAn ambassador is an honest gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country.\u201d\n\nDoubtless in the days ahead, technical intelligence assessments, fragments of weaponry and photographs will be produced to convince many western minds that Iran was responsible for what Pompeo has described as \u201can act of war\u201d. But it is an uphill task.\n\nIn a new media age \u2013 where everything is more open to contest \u2013 politicians are going to have to work ever harder to convince sceptical electorates of the veracity of their statements, especially when building a case for military action. Their casual peacetime lies, corroding public trust, make that task more difficult.", "description": "Disentangling responsibility has been made so much harder by casual peacetime mendacity", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1255663d0ead75700fc663579a0d5918ad0362f1/0_60_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50c22b60dfde6f86bcb55c7f5505baa3", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
