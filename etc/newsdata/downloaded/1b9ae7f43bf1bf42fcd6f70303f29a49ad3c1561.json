The attack comes less than 72 hours after President Trump announced that he\u2019d pull U.S. special operations forces from the area in order to keep them out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nMr. Erdogan said the Turkish military launched the assault in conjunction with the Syrian National Army, a rebel group backed by Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish Armed Forces, together with the Syrian National Army [rebel groups backed by Turkey], just launched #OperationPeaceSpring against Kurdish militias and the Islamic State group in northern Syria,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will preserve Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and liberate local communities from terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe offensive targets the Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces (SDF), a key American ally in the years-long fight against the Islamic State. Turkey considers elements of the group to be terrorists.\n\nMr. Trump condemned the attack but also placed faith in Turkey to avoid civilian casualties.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThere are no American soldiers in the area. From the first day, I entered the political arena, I made it clear that I did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars \u2014 especially those that don\u2019t benefit the United States. Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2014 and we will hold them to this commitment.\u201d\n\nTurkish television reported that warplanes and artillery batteries targeted Kurdish positions in Tal Abyad near the Syrian-Turkish border. Turkish media also reported that the Kurdish forces had fired back, shooting mortar shells into the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.\n\nReports out of northern Syria also say that Turkey also has started targeting civilians. An SDF spokesman told the Associated Press that Turkish planes are attacking \u201ccivilian areas\u201d in the region.\n\nInternational leaders called for an immediate end to the hostilities.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the Turkish offensive in the northeast of Syria in the strongest possible terms,\u201d German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.\n\nOther leaders urged Turkey to exercise restraint, fearing that the Islamic State could be revitalized as Kurdish attention turns away from the terrorist group and toward its fight with Turkey.\n\n\u201c#NATO has been informed by Turkish authorities about their ongoing operation in Northern Syria. I count on Turkey to act with restraint & ensure that the gains we have made in the fight against ISIS are not jeopardised. I will discuss this issue with President Erdogan Friday,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Twitter.\n\nMr. Trump has threatened to \u201cobliterate\u201d the Turkish economy if Mr. Erdogan orders a slaughter of Kurdish civilians or otherwise goes too far in Syria.\n\nCongressional leaders also have threatened to respond with massive sanctions against Turkey.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers have condemned the president for pulling back U.S. forces and exposing the SDF to the Turkish assault.\n\n\u201cThis is shameful,\u201d Rep. Tim Ryan, Ohio Democrat and 2020 presidential hopeful, said on Twitter. \u201cDonald Trump has betrayed our Kurdish allies and put thousands of lives at risk. This is exactly what Russia, Iran and Turkey want, and the president is recklessly playing right into it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
