Then add in pure vanilla extract and beat until smooth.\n\nTurn down your mixer to low and add in flour mixture in three intervals beating after each addition until well-combined. Lastly, add in chocolate chips, butterscotch chips and chopped pretzels.\n\nPlace dough in the refrigerator for at least one hour. Two hours is even better. When ready to bake, scoop cookie dough in balls the size of a tablespoon and place on parchment paper lined cookie sheet at least one and a half inches apart. Carefully press a mini pretzel into the center of each cookie and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. Bake 11-13 minutes then allow cookies to cool for at least four to five minutes then serve.\n\n\n\nJocelyn's Baking Tips\n\nSugar Ratio: I use more brown sugar than granulated sugar. Brown sugar, due to the addition of molasses, has more moisture in it resulting in a chewier cookie.\n\nEgg Ratio: This cookie has two egg yolks in addition to one egg. The egg yolks give the dough more fat content resulting in more chewiness.\n\nSecret Ingredient: Cornstarch is what I add to my cookies to make them chewier. When combined with flour, it can help to soften the cookies changing the texture like magic.\n\nChill Time: Do not skip the chilling of the dough. It is essential for two reasons:\n\n1. It helps to make sure your dough doesn't spread too much and keeps it shape while it bakes.\n\n2. The resting time allows the flour to absorb some of the liquids (chewy cookies have more moisture in their batter) in the dough which also helps to set the cookie\u2019s structure.\n\nRecipes reprinted courtesy of Jocelyn Delk Adams.\n\nWant more cookie recipes that are perfect for your holiday party, cookie swap or next family gathering?
