It was recently unveiled at a zoo in Paris.\n\nReuters\n\nVisitors to the Zoological Park can expect to see the blob as a harmless puddle of yellow goo on a log or rock .\n\n\"The blob is a living being which belongs to one of nature\u2019s mysteries,\" said Bruno David, the director of the Paris Museum of Natural History, to Reuters.\n\nDon't Miss 20.9 K SHARES 14.3 K SHARES 18.6 K SHARES 7.5 K SHARES 5.4 K SHARES\n\n\"We know for sure it is not a plant but we don\u2019t really [know] if it\u2019s an animal or a fungus. It behaves very surprisingly for something that looks like a mushroom ... it has the behavior of an animal, it is able to learn.\"\n\nThe zoological park is part of the Paris Museum of Natural History and this is the first time the zoo has ever made a display to spotlight a creature like this.\n\n\"It surprises us because it has no brain but is able to learn,\" explained David to The Guardian, \"and if you merge two blobs, the one that has learned will transmit its knowledge to the other.\"\n\nNamed after the 1958 sci-fi horror movie The Blob about an alien creature that crashes to Earth and devours residents of Pennsylvania, the real-life blob consists of a single cell, sometimes with many nuclei that can replicate their DNA and divide, reports AFP.\n\nThe blob's genetic material is so varied that the species possesses over 700 sexes. \"Reproduction is not a problem\" with that much genetic diversity, stated the zoo on its website.\n\nIf you cut at the slime-like material, it can \"self-heal in two minutes.\"\n\nIt also has a knack for survival. In another experiment, scientists microwaved the organism, then added water to the dried out leftovers. Within moments, the blob was revived and ready to eat and grow again.\n\nFor scientists Blob was proof that there were different ways for creatures to process information and adjust their behavior.
