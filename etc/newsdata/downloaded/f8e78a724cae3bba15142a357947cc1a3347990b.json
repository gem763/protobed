But such is his value that the lock was picked in New Zealand\u2019s squad for his second Rugby World Cup in expectation he would be available for the quarterfinals. He has become available two weeks ahead of schedule, and his teammates know he\u2019s ready.\n\nBecause he\u2019s been a pest more than usual in training sessions.\n\nAs his shoulder has improved, Retallick has been helping out the opposing team against the starting All Blacks in game scenarios. And the starters, used to having Retallick on their side for seven years, have not enjoyed it. Retallick takes the game scenarios so seriously that he also practices gamesmanship. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re teammates; to him they\u2019re on the other side, so he niggles with pulls, tugs, pushes, and pokes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been annoying the last couple of weeks,\u201d stand-in captain Sam Whitelock says.\n\nRetallick and Whitelock will appear together in the second row for a 52nd test. In test rugby, they rank behind only South Africa\u2019s Bakkies Botha and Victor Matfield, who started together 60 times.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely annoying (in training) at lineout time, maul time, breakdown,\u201d Whitelock adds. \u201cI know it (annoys) the halfbacks a little bit when they pass and he gives them a wee push or pull of an arm. They\u2019re the guys who are probably happiest to see him out there. It\u2019s going to be good having him back on the same side, and not annoying us.\u201d\n\nScrumhalf Aaron Smith agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see him back in that niggly state.\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s in the defensive team, he takes you out after the play, quickly tugs you. I always tell him, \u2018Leave my forearms alone.\u2019 He always gets 9s, he\u2019s got such long arms. You can tell he\u2019s hungry and working really hard. He carries a lot of mana (respect) in this team.\u201d\n\nAsked why he does it, Retallick smiles.\n\n\u201cI like annoying the ones that bite pretty easy to get a reaction,\u201d he says.\n\nNamibia has promised to be annoying, too.\n\n\u201cWe have huge respect for New Zealand,\u201d Namibia coach Phil Davies says, \u201cbut we want to go out there and make it as difficult as we possibly can and compete for 80 minutes.\u201d\n\nThe Namibians have lost to Italy 47-22 and to South Africa 57-3, and want to repeat the good account they gave in their only previous match with the All Blacks, a 58-14 loss in the 2015 World Cup at the London Olympic Stadium.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of incentive for New Zealand with the chance to confirm a quarterfinals spot with a third win in three Pool B games.\n\nThere\u2019s also some relief that the game has an early afternoon start. The evening games have been hindered by increasingly humid conditions, making the ball more slick the longer the game goes.\n\nIt\u2019s why the All Blacks, as they tore apart Canada 63-0 on Wednesday under the roof in Oita, scored most of their points in the first and third quarters.\n\nCoach Steve Hansen wasn\u2019t alarmed by the handing errors.\n\n\u201cWe want to improve upon it but you can\u2019t do more than train with a wet ball, which we\u2019ve been doing the whole time we\u2019ve been here. It\u2019s incredibly difficult when you have someone smashing you when you\u2019re catching it and the ball is slippery like a piece of soap. You just have to accept from time to time you\u2019re going to drop it.\n\n\u201cWe handled the ball 400 times and I think we only dropped it 12 (times against Canada). On average, we will have four knock-ons in a game; in this one, we only had five. We\u2019ve never handled the ball that many times. You can make a big thing out of it or you can recognize its going to be difficult and be a little more secure with the ball going into contact. We just have to work hard to eliminate mistakes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brodie Retallick is available to play, and the All Blacks are relieved.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
