Prices had dipped 1.2% in the previous week on hopes that\n\nan end to the U.S.-China trade tiff could be near.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 0.8% to $1,510.70 per ounce.\n\nThe attacks on Saudi oil installations have lead to a\n\nrotation of interests out of stocks and into safe-havens, said\n\nOANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.\n\nThe risk-averse sentiment in the market underpinned the\n\nbullion, often seen as an alternative investment during times of\n\npolitical and financial uncertainty.\n\nWith escalating tensions in the Middle East and hopes of\n\nmore stimulus measures from major central banks, the next target\n\nfor gold will be $1,530, Halley added.\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebel group claimed\n\nresponsibility for the attack over the weekend on the world's\n\nbiggest oil-processing facility. However, a senior U.S. official said that evidence indicated\n\nTehran was behind it, and President Donald Trump said the United\n\nStates was \"locked and loaded\" for a potential response to the\n\nattack, souring its already strained relations with Iran.\n\nThe event hurt risk sentiment in the markets, with Asian\n\nequities trading lower, and the safe-haven yen up 0.4%\n\nagainst the dollar. MKTS/GLOB\n\nInvestors also await the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve\n\nand Bank of Japan's policy meetings on Wednesday, for signals on\n\ntheir future policy path. FEDWATCH \"(The Saudi attacks) are supportive for gold, but prices are\n\nstill under pressure as investors are awaiting the Fed's\n\nannouncement,\" said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at\n\nGeojit Financial Services, adding that $1,465 was the current\n\nsupport level for gold.\n\nCentral banks globally are facing increasing pressure to dole\n\nout monetary support for flagging economies as the U.S.-China\n\ntrade dispute hurt trade and business sentiment. Lower interest\n\nrates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding\n\nbullion and weigh on the dollar.\n\nDismal Chinese data indicating that industrial production\n\nhad grown at its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years also weighed on\n\nmarket sentiment. Spot gold could retest resistance at $1,524 per ounce, as it\n\nhas temporarily bottomed around a support at $1,480, said\n\nReuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, silver jumped as much as\n\n3% to $18 an ounce and platinum XPT= was up 0.7% at $954.34.\n\nMeanwhile, palladium XPD= rose 1.2% to $1,626.11 per ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold jumps 1% as attacks on Saudi lift safe-haven bets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
