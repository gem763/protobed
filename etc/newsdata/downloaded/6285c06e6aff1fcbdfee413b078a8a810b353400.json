REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\n\u201cWe will go to our next meeting, have a discussion about what\u2019s appropriate, and I\u2019m extremely open-minded to making an adjustment if that\u2019s what the appropriate policy is,\u201d Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said in Madrid, a few hours before a report showed growth in the vast U.S. services sector may be stalling.\n\nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, speaking in a Houston suburb after that report, cautioned against reading too much into a single data point, but said he too has an \u201copen mind\u201d and is watching \u201cextremely carefully\u201d to see if weakness spreads to the consumer and labor market.\n\n\u201cIf we wait for weakness in global growth and manufacturing and business investment to seep into other parts of the economy... I think we likely have waited too long,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nThough the Fed\u2019s two rate cuts so far this year have reduced the likelihood of a severe downturn, they have not eliminated it, Kaplan said.\n\nAnd while he does not want to fuel excesses in borrowing and risk-taking, Kaplan said, \u201cI would rather use adjusting the Fed funds rate if we need to when it matters, which I think is doing it sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nAfter the services report, contracts tied to the Fed\u2019s policy rate soared, as traders ramped up bets the Fed will follow rate cuts in July and September with further reductions at both its next meetings.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates twice this year as U.S. businesses were hit by rising trade tensions with China, political risk including Britain\u2019s potentially chaotic divorce from the European Union, and weakening economic growth in Germany and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. consumer spending and jobs growth have so far remained strong, momentum that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers have attributed at least in part to the Fed\u2019s pivot from a tightening stance as recently as 10 months ago.\n\nBut Fed policymakers have said they are on the lookout for any signs that the hit from trade uncertainty and a weakening global economy is no longer confined to the U.S. export and manufacturing sectors.\n\nOn Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM)\u2019s non-manufacturing activity index flashed just such a warning signal, falling to 52.6 in September, the lowest reading since August 2016.\n\nSeparate data earlier in the week showed an index of U.S. factory activity contracting to its lowest level in more than a decade.\n\nRate futures traders now see a 90% chance of a quarter-of-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s October 29-30 meeting, and a better-than-even chance of a fourth rate cut by year\u2019s end that would bring the central bank\u2019s target range to 1.25% to 1.5% and completely reverse all of last year\u2019s tightening.\n\nU.S. stocks also rose on expectations of further Fed rate cuts.\n\nA government report on September jobs growth, out early Friday, could be pivotal as Fed policymakers weigh whether trade uncertainties are reaching deeper into the U.S. economy.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who was against the decision to cut rates in July, on Thursday pushed back against the idea that the labor market could strengthen much further than it is now. Unemployment in August registered at 3.7%, well below most economists\u2019 view of a sustainable level without pushing up on inflation.", "description": "Fed policymakers said on Thursday they are open to the possibility of another rate cut as data indicated that a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing is beginning to spread to other parts of the world's biggest economy.", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas Aguado", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436792774&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921S7"}
