'Yes, the cake is beautiful. However, focus on the font!'\n\nThe cake's topper swiftly caused social media to go wild, with the post receiving over 1,000 reactions and scores of comments.\n\nMany agreed that the decoration did look like a swear word.\n\n'Absolutely love it, the f-word makes it better,' said one commenter.\n\nAnother added: 'The R is deff way too close to the T making the cursive T resemble an F. Still a beautiful cake, just toss out the topper.'\n\nA third said they thought the cake was stunning regardless of the fact they thought the topper said 'f off'.\n\nHalloween is celebrated October 31, a night where kids hit the streets in costumes 'trick or treating' neighbours and friends (stock image)\n\n'Scrolling through I thought it said 'f off then realised it's supposed to say trick or treat. Beautiful cake, too bad they ran out of time to proofread the topper.'\n\nA few commenting on the post said there was a chance the topper may have been an intentional Halloween trick.\n\n'That's the best damned Trick or Treat I've ever seen!,' said one.\n\n'10/10 I love this cake for all the reasons it is a fail.'", "description": "A photo of a children's Halloween cake topped with what appears to be a very rude word has the internet in stitches.
