We continue to urge Beijing to uphold its commitments,\" said David Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\n\nTrump raised questions about his commitment to protecting freedoms in Hong Kong when he referred in August to its mass street protests as \"riots\" that were a matter for China to deal with.\n\nHe has since called on China to handle the issue humanely and warned that if anything bad happened in Hong Kong it could be bad for trade talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST PHASE\n\nTrump said on Friday China and the United States had reached the first phase of a trade deal that covered agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections, and would ease reciprocal trade restrictions that the world's two largest economies have been imposing for 15 months.\n\nOfficials on both sides said last week much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed. But Trump said on Wednesday he would \"probably\" sign it with Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum in Santiago from Nov. 11 to 17.\n\n\"There's been a lot of goodwill between the United States and China over the last period of time,\" Trump said. \"We'll probably do a signing over there of phase one, assuming it all gets finished up, which we think it will.\"\n\nTrump has made China a principal target for criticism throughout his presidency. He has also stressed his personal relationship with Xi, and his focus on securing a trade deal with Beijing has stoked worries that he might subordinate human rights issues, including the welfare of Hong Kong, to that aim.\n\nThe State Department's Stilwell was asked by Republican Senator Cory Gardner whether he believed Xi Jinping represented the greatest long-term threat to U.S. security interests.\n\nHe said Xi had made some \"troubling choices\" - including by naming himself president without term - \"that deviated from a system that was becoming more regularized.\"\n\n\"In some ways that predictability brought stability. It\u2019s becoming less predictable,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, Trump hailed Xi as \"president for life\" after China's ruling Communist Party said it was eliminating a two-term limit for the presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by David Brunnstrom and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "The U.S. State Department and Congress took aim at China on Wednesday, even as President Donald Trump hailed \"goodwill\" between Washington and Beijing and said he expected to sign the first phase of a trade deal with President Xi Jinping next month.
