The tangerine-clad supporters who had made the 40-mile trip south were unhappy with what they had just seen. A disjointed, scrappy, uninventive match, slowed by an officious referee and bereft of anything approaching a plausible attempt on goal, it was not hard to understand the collective disappointment. But for Tim Fielding, far from dispiriting, this was a sound to make him smile.\n\n\u201cI find it genuinely refreshing we\u2019re moaning about the football again,\u201d said Fielding, a former chairman of the Blackpool Supporters\u2019 Trust. \u201cWhingeing about the lack of goals is what we should be doing as football supporters, not worrying about lack of governance. It shows we\u2019re back to being a normal club.\u201d\n\nHe has a point. Sure, there may have been a lack of quality on the Bolton pitch, but in many ways there was something to celebrate in the fact this fixture could go ahead finally unencumbered by the serial incompetents who had brought both clubs to the very lip of disaster. This was the match over which the clouds had now lifted at last.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a new start,\u201d said Alan Jervis, a Bolton fan who recalls, as a five-year-old, watching his local side win the 1958 FA Cup final on the television his father bought specially. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of irresponsible people spending money they didn\u2019t have at this club, buying players they couldn\u2019t afford and watching them not being bothered to run after the ball. Now reality has hit I think we can properly begin again. At least we\u2019ve got football to watch. Unlike them poor lot at Bury.\u201d\n\nFor too much of their recent history these two grand old clubs have been mired in muddle, misery and dispute. At Blackpool, a four-year fan boycott only ended in March when the poisonous ownership of the Oyston family came to an abrupt, high court-directed end.", "description": "At the end of an inconclusive Lancashire derby on Monday night, the south stand of the University of Bolton Stadium that was rammed with Blackpool fans erupted in sustained booing.", "authors": ["Jim White", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212356201-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqiUuvBizZT2q34Osm0tNw0AfBeJkwmGGiHKEhSH-Rog.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
