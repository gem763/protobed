United played against Sporting Lisbon and Ronaldo was outstanding and they signed him.\u201d\n\nArsenal fans aren\u2019t the only ones wondering what could have been.\n\n\"You could imagine at the time what it would have been like to have Thierry Henry and Ronaldo together... That would certainly have changed a little bit the history of my stay here as well,\u201d Wenger continued.\n\n\"Once we were at 4.5 million pounds, we were still in negotiations... so we were very close. But Man United went to 12 million pounds, which we could not afford at the time.\"\n\nRonaldo recently opened up about his meeting with Wenger, recalling: \"I met with Arsene Wenger and was about to go to Arsenal.\n\n\u201cI talked to Barcelona , Real Madridand Inter too but after the friendly against Manchester United, who were already interested, they became even more interested and they sped up negotiations and signed me.\"\n\n2) Lionel Messi\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIf missing out on Ronaldo wasn\u2019t bad enough, Arsenal could have also had Lionel Messi in their ranks.\n\nIn reality, Wenger\u2019s comments suggest a move was never likely to materialise - but things could have played out differently.\n\nRumours suggested Messi was once given an Arsenal shirt with his name on, which Wenger has denied, but talks did take place.\n\n\u201cWe were in discussion with him when we bought Fabregas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can realise sometimes what fantastic youth teams you had before when you\u2019re a club like Barcelona.\n\n\u201cBut in the same team: Messi, Pique and Fabregas.\n\n\u201cPique and Fabregas came to England and Messi stayed in Spain.\n\n\u201cWe were interested in him, yes. But he was untouchable at the time.\u201d\n\nIf he was untouchable then, he\u2019s certainly untouchable now. Unlucky, Arsene.\n\n3) Jadon Sancho\n\n(Image: MDM)\n\nWill wonderkid Jadon Sancho become the next global superstar like Ronaldo or Messi?\n\nHe already has one thing in common with the pair - he was an Arsene Wenger target as a teenager.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take him from Man City when he didn\u2019t get the games,\u201d Wenger said.\n\n\u201cI tried to lure him because he\u2019s from London. I tried to get him to Arsenal.\u201d\n\nWenger\u2019s approach did not work - he has instead gone to Borussia Dortmund and emerged as one of the most highly-rated in the game.\n\nStill, time is still on Arsenal\u2019s side as they hope to one day see Sancho in red and white.\n\nWenger added: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best players of his generation. He can dribble, he has the arrogance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in there that is part of the big players. You can call it arrogance, confidence, belief; but it has to be there.\u201d\n\n4) Zlatan Ibrahimovic\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPost picture in an Arsenal shirt? Check. Sign for Arsenal? Negative.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic was close to becoming a Gunner - but a lack of faith in the Swedish youngster cost Wenger a huge signing.\n\n\"Arsene gave me the famous red and white jersey - the No 9 shirt with Ibrahimovic on it and I was so pleased I even posed for a picture wearing it,\u201d Ibrahimovich recalled.\n\n\"It was a fantastic moment for me. Arsenal had a great team then and here was an Arsenal shirt made just for me.\n\n\u201cSo then I waited for him to convince me that I should join Arsenal. But he didn't even try.\n\n\u201cHe never actually made me a serious offer, it was more, 'I want to see how good you are, what kind of player you are. Have a trial'.\n\n\u201cI couldn't believe it. I was like, 'No way, Zlatan doesn't do auditions'.\n\n\"I thought 'You either know me or you don't and if you don't know me you can't really want me'.\"\n\nWhen Wenger face his version of events, he explained: \u201cHe was here at 16 but he chose to go to Ajax, which was a big disappointment because I wanted to sign him as a youngster.\n\n\u201cI regret not being able to sign him very much because he is a very talented player and he has made a big reputation for himself within Europe as one of the best strikers of his type.\"\n\n5) Paul Pogba\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThere\u2019s a theme here - Wenger loves a young prospect.\n\nThe latest big name he attempted to take to Arsenal was Paul Pogba.\n\nUnfortunately, the Frenchman had his heart set on Juventus , where he spent a strong spell before heading back to Manchester United.\n\n\u201cThings happened very quickly. We were interested in him,\u201d Wenger said in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe tried to get him to come here. But he very quickly signed for Juventus.\u201d\n\nPogba could still be in the move again from Old Trafford, but a move down to north London seems unlikely.\n\n6) Didier Drogba\n\nOf all the players who Arsenal failed to sign, none came back to bite them as directly as Didier Drogba.\n\nThe powerhouse striker became a club legend down the road at Chelsea , scoring a host of crucial goals against the Gunners.\n\n\u201cI would have loved to have managed Didier Drogba for two reasons,\" Wenger previously said.\n\n\u201cI missed him when he played in France at Le Mans \u2013 not even in the top league. I knew he was good player there and I missed him.\n\n\u201cAnd secondly because he hurt us so much in big games that all this pain would not have happened.\u201d\n\n7) N'Golo Kante\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nN\u2019Golo Kante was considered a remarkable find for Leicester when he arrived from France for a modest fee.\n\nBut he was also spotted by Arsenal, if Wenger is to be believed, and again the subject of interest before joining fellow Londoners Chelsea.\n\nAsked at a press conference before taking on Kante at Chelsea, Wenger confirmed: \u201cHave I looked to sign Kant\u00e9? Yes.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in France, and when he was at Leicester.\u201d\n\n8) Gianluigi Buffon\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nArsene Wenger had a huge task early on at Arsenal - trying to replace David Seaman.\n\nAfter the retirement of the former England stopper, he even had a coffee with Gianluigi Buffon, the then-Parma youngster tipped for the top.\n\n\"I remember when I was 20 years old in 1998, I had dinner once with Wenger,\u201d Buffon recalled.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only Premier League club to target Buffon, with the Italian legend eventually joining Juventus.\n\n\u201cFrom what I know, there have been three serious times when English clubs made an approach for me,\" Buffon stated.\n\n\u201cTwo of them were when I was a young player at Parma, and I know Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger asked about me \u2013 and then, when Manchester Citywas taken over, I know they approached Juventus.\u201d\n\n9) Yaya Toure\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nPerhaps the most well-known tale on the list - Yaya Toure\u2019s infamous Arsenal trial.\n\nThe midfielder even played a game for Arsenal during his trial.\n\nWenger insists he did want to sign the future Barcelona and Manchester City maestro, opening up on the truth behind his brief stint in north London.\n\n\u201cLet's not forget that Yaya Toure had an agreement with us,\u201d Wenger lamented. \u201cAnd it's not because we did not want to sign him that he went to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe needed to wait for his passport in Belgium. We have made mistakes but he is not a mistake, it's just the fact that he preferred to go to Metalurh Donetsk. He could go there without any passport.\u201d\n\n10) Luis Suarez\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOK, this one might be a stretch considering the reaction it got.\n\nBut Arsenal\u2019s bizarre pursuit of Luis Suarez could not be left off the list.\n\nThe Gunners launched a bid of \u00a340,000,000.01 for the Uruguayan striker during the peak of his powers at Liverpool .\n\nThey mistakenly believed they could trigger a \u00a340m release clause, leaving their Premier League rivals unimpressed.\n\n\u201cWe had an agreement with the players and we had been wrongly advised that he had a clause (in his contract),\u201d said Wenger.\n\nEven more interesting, Wenger claims he was keen to ditch Anfield for the Emirates, eventually joining Barcelona.\n\n\u201cYou can ask the player,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cHe will confirm that he wanted to join us.\n\n\u201cThen they kept him one more year, improved his contract and promised to sell him to a club abroad.\u201d", "description": "The Gunners were linked with a string of high-profile names during Arsene Wenger's tenure", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images", "Mdm", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20552686.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-185840580.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
