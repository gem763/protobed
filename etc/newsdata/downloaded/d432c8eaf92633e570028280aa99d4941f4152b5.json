If we can just give each other information when we pass the ball it makes it a lot more simple so that's the next step for us.\"", "description": "The Red Devils striker missed a spot kick against Crystal Palace in August and had similar luck on Sunday", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738633.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Norwich-City-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
