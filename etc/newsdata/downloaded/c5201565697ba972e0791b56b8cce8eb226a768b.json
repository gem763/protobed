But at the end of Season 4\u2014and now in Season 5\u2014the show seems to be strengthening its approach to trickier, potentially polarizing topics while still staying true to its characters. Though corporate\u2019s greed is nothing new, the executives\u2019 decision to call ICE is depicted as particularly coldblooded. Mateo\u2019s departure in the wake of that raid\u2014he\u2019s shown sitting behind the caged windows of a Homeland Security van, arms restrained in a plastic zip tie\u2014made for a sobering moment on the usually vociferous show. Weaving this immigration story line into the existing union narrative is a relatively complicated storytelling move for Superstore; it suggests that the show could start approaching so-called issues on a more systemic level.\n\nEarly in the Season 5 premiere, Amy seems to have lost some of the defiance she showed in the Season 4 finale. She encourages Jonah to scale back on union activities. \u201cCorporate is checking in every day. They are super paranoid,\u201d Amy tells him. But her visit to see Mateo in a local ICE detention center changes her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s cold and there aren\u2019t enough blankets,\u201d Mateo says, his tone deflated. \u201cThe guards think all undocumented people are Latinos, so they just keep yelling at me in Spanish and I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying.\u201d No matter a viewer\u2019s stance on U.S. immigration policy, the moment is a tragic one that complicates and personalizes the subject via a fan-favorite character.\n\nIndeed, Superstore\u2019s ever-growing ensemble is one of its biggest strengths. Over time, the show has steadily built complexity into what could seem, at the outset, like stereotypical characters: a conservative, religious white man; a gay, undocumented immigrant from the Philippines; a teenage mother; and a Syrian refugee, to name just a few. Another of the show\u2019s assets is how it has managed to comment on labor issues without moralizing. As recently as May, Spitzer maintained that the show is \u201cnot trying to say why things are bad or say how to fix them.\u201d But Season 4 also marked Spitzer\u2019s last as showrunner. Now Superstore is in the hands of the executive producers Jonathan Green and Gabe Miller, who could potentially nudge the show in new, more challenging directions.\n\nAs if the immigration and union story lines weren\u2019t enough, the Season 5 premiere introduces another threat to employees: automation. In an attempt to modernize its business, corporate sends Store No. 1217 a new \u201chigh-tech floor cleaner.\u201d The robot excites most of the workers at first, but Jonah sees the machine for what it is\u2014their future replacement. \u201cIt was nice of corporate to wait an entire week before they reminded us we\u2019re just as replaceable as Mateo,\u201d he sarcastically remarks. His anxiety quickly spreads to the others. \u201cHow can we compete with a machine that doesn\u2019t get tired or ask for health care or a raise?\u201d Jonah later asks a small group gathered in the break room. The answer slowly dawns on the workers, but Sayid (Amir M. Korangy), a refugee from Syria, says it first: \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect employee.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s left unsaid is that a store full of \u201cperfect employees\u201d is also one without Sayid and Mateo and Amy and Jonah and Glenn\u2014characters whom viewers have come to care about and who aren\u2019t, no matter what corporate says, quite so expendable.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
