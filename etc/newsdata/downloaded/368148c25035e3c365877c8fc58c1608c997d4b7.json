But the judges signaled that they were unlikely to change their minds by inviting plaintiffs in the case to seek a summary judgment ending the case in their favor. And the judges said they were prepared to postpone primary elections should that prove necessary to further litigate the case or draw new House districts.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nThe plaintiffs, North Carolina residents, were sponsored by the National Redistricting Foundation, an arm of a Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. that is seeking to challenge Republican control of the next round of redistricting in 2021.\n\nThe House map drawn by Republican legislators in 2016 all but guaranteed the party\u2019s control of 10 of the state\u2019s 13 House districts, even though voters\u2019 political preferences are split almost evenly between the two major parties. A separate challenge to the same map went to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in June that it did not have the ability to regulate partisan gerrymandering, however egregious.\n\nBut the state panel said the map violated broader provisions in North Carolina\u2019s Constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech and assembly and equal protection under the law, as well as a guarantee of free elections that does not appear in the federal Constitution.\n\nThe ruling in the end came down to very different decisions in federal and state courts on whether blatant gerrymandering to benefit a political party is permissible.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina Republicans tried to beat democracy with their gerrymandered maps, and the U.S. Supreme Court would have let them get away with it,\u201d Stanton Jones, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said on Monday. \u201cThe state court\u2019s decision today ensures that North Carolinians will finally get to vote in free and fair congressional elections.\u201d\n\nMr. Holder called the ruling a belated victory for the state\u2019s voters. \u201cFor nearly a decade, Republicans have forced the people of North Carolina to vote in districts that were manipulated for their own partisan advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cNow \u2014 finally \u2014 the era of Republican gerrymandering in the state is coming to an end.\u201d\n\nState Senate President Phil Berger, a Republican, responded to the decision by saying, \u201cWith judges deciding behind closed doors how many members of Congress from each party is acceptable, judicial elections have become the most consequential in America.\u201d\n\nThe order further upends a North Carolina political landscape that was, until this autumn, carefully crafted to maintain Republican dominance in all but the most unlikely Democratic landslides. The same three-judge panel struck down most of the State Legislature\u2019s maps in September as Republican partisan gerrymanders, citing the same violations of state constitutional clauses. Republicans elected then to redraw the maps, which were approved by the same court on Monday in a separate order.\n\nRepublican legislators did not immediately respond to the latest order. They could oppose a motion for summary judgment and, should it come, appeal it to the state Supreme Court. But the three-judge panel suggested on Monday that the Republican legislative leaders forgo legal arguments and use the same bipartisan map-drawing process employed to draft the new state legislative districts.\n\nThe court\u2019s ban on the House map is only the latest move in a long-running legal battle in which Republicans now appear, however unwittingly, to have stacked the deck against themselves.\n\nParty leaders first produced a House map whose lines were heavily in their favor in 2011, after surging to control of both houses of the State Legislature in elections the previous fall. But in 2016, after battles in both state and federal courts, the United States Supreme Court ruled that two of the 13 districts were racially gerrymandered to dilute black voting power, and ordered them redrawn.\n\nSeeking to avoid any appearance of bias, party leaders said publicly they would draw the new map using political rather than racial parameters, a strategy they said at the time was completely legal. One of the map\u2019s principal drafters boasted in 2016 that he had given Republicans a 10-to-3 edge in seats \u201cbecause I do not believe it\u2019s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\u201d\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has ruled that partisan maps are political documents beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution, it has long held that gerrymanders based on race violate both federal voting rights law and constitutional protections.\n\nRepublicans defended the House map on the same grounds in a federal lawsuit, and won at the Supreme Court in June. But in the process, the three-judge panel noted, they left \u201ca detailed record of both the partisan intent and the intended partisan effect of the 2016 congressional districts.\u201d\n\nThat record was so extensive, the judges said, that it left little doubt that opponents of the map would be able to prove in a trial that it violated the State Constitution.\n\nWith primary elections only months away, Republican legislators had argued that it was too late to discard the 2016 maps without seriously disrupting House election campaigns that in some cases were already underway. But the judges said North Carolinians would be irreparably harmed if the 2020 election \u2014 like the preceding ones in 2018 and 2016 \u2014 were conducted using maps that appeared to be illegally gerrymandered.\n\nAnd while the challenge to the House map was, in fact, unusually late, the judges wrote, the court would commit to a final ruling in the case before the filing period for the 2020 primary elections, which will take place on March 3.", "description": "A North Carolina state court effectively threw out the state\u2019s map of congressional districts on Monday, saying critics were poised to show \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that it was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander favoring Republicans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJuZBQ.img?h=169&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
