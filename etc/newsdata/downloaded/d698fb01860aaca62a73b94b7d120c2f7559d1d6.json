As we\u2019re in the final throes of leaving, or maybe not, or perhaps simply going to hell in a handcart, it seems important to get the views of the 18th-century Scottish surgeon, writer and author of the 1763 bilious best-seller, Travels Through France And Italy. The pioneering travel writer knew a thing or two about le continent, and wasn\u2019t impressed. Certainly, he\u2019d have been full on for Brexit, given his views of the French. \u201cDirty knaves\u201d was just the start.\n\nThen again, he would have considered Brexiteers imbeciles, because that\u2019s how he considered almost everyone who wasn\u2019t Tobias Smollett. He would, thus, have been both for and against \u2013 fitting, really, for a fellow who, while disapproving of pretty much everything the French did, effectively inaugurated tourism to their country. Where Smollett led, other Britons followed, inventing, especially southern, France as a holiday destination. Then everyone else rolled in; now France is world tourism leader, earning more from visitors than from either farming or the car industry. Clearly, Tobias is due a posthumous legion-d\u2019honneur. So are the rest of us (though without the posthumous bit). When we finally say \u201cadieu\u201d to France politically, we\u2019ll remain woven into the fabric of some of their most outstanding spots. Nothing can unweave us.", "description": "", "authors": ["Anthony Peregrine", "Destination Expert"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/english-france-top-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
