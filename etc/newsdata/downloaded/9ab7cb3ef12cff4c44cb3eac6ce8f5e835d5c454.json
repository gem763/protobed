However, he recently told MMA Junkie that he\u2019d drop back down to light heavyweight for one fight only.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, if I get down to around 230, 235 and I feel comfortable, I\u2019ll go down to light heavyweight,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut it would only be to fight Jon.\u201d\n\nThat got Jones\u2019 attention, who shared some words in a pair of tweets.\n\nYou better make sure you have that cardio together big fella @Anthony_Rumble \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 15, 2019\n\nYou better make sure you have that cardio together big fella\n\nWe\u2019ve always been cool but I\u2019ll be more than happy to choke you out if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. @Anthony_Rumble \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 15, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ve always been cool but I\u2019ll be more than happy to choke you out if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nJones and Johnson do have some unfinished business. Johnson was supposed to challenge Jones for the light heavyweight title at UFC 187 in 2015, but Jones was stripped and suspended indefinitely in connection with a hit-and-run before the fight took place. Johnson went on to fight Daniel Cormier for the vacant belt and lost by submission in the third round.\n\nFrom there, \u201cRumble\u201d strung together three consecutive wins by knockout to earn a rematch with Cormier at UFC 210. After losing by second-round submission this time, Johnson announced his retirement.\n\nSince then, Johnson launched his cannabis company, Competitive Body Development. He still plans on being part of it despite his intended return to the UFC. Johnson also has served as an ambassador for Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship.\n\nJones currently is without a next fight after making two title defenses this year. On Tuesday, he took a plea deal in a case in which a cocktail waitress alleged he slapped her vagina during a visit to a strip club.", "description": "Say something about wanting to fight Jon Jones, and he'll likely clap back at you.", "authors": ["Simon Samano", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/jon-jones-anthony-johnson-dana-white.jpg?w=640&h=420&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
