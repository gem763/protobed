Others allow greetings at the school-gate to turn into a furtive affair. For Serge Pizzorno of Kasabian, the looming 40s have brought the desire to shed the skin of the rock guitarist and become a hip-hop star. The rapping part isn\u2019t as important, though, as being able to swagger across the stage in a white vest and thick chains, knees bent, arms straight, and Pizzorno does a lot of that.\n\nHe also puts on a suit and appears behind a presidential-style podium for Meanwhile \u2026 at the Welcome Break, suggesting that the part of him that doesn\u2019t want to be Tupac quite fancies being Pete Townshend and knocking out the odd rock opera. It\u2019s tremendous fun in a faintly ridiculous way, not least because, whether or not he\u2019s having a midlife crisis, he knows how to knock out a tune, and also because the presentation \u2013 at one point Stephen Graham appears on a screen fronting a faux shopping channel video \u2013 is more ambitious than one normally gets in midsize venues.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Genuine eccentric ...

Photograph: Andy Ford/The Guardian\n\nMost of what Pizzorno offers on his first solo album as the SLP isn\u2019t a million miles away from his main band \u2013 it\u2019s a bit heavier on the borrowings from R&B, house and, yes, hip-hop, but then Kasabian have always had a bit more imagination than most of their ladrock brethren. Here though, it\u2019s all about bringing the focus to him alone. For almost the entire evening, the band are hidden behind screens, while Pizzorno repeatedly clambers into the crowd and chivvies them in to cheering for him. It speaks of someone needy for love and attention, and it is offered to him. \u201cGo on, Serge!\u201d is shouted, repeatedly, as if he\u2019s a football player.\n\nKasabian's Serge Pizzorno: 'Being pretentious is my number one fear' Read more\n\nThe album is played in its entirety and then Pizzorno is gone. It\u2019s just the right length \u2013 an hour or so \u2013 to marvel at how rock music can still throw up genuine eccentrics willing to throw all their ideas at the wall in the hope that some of them will stick.
