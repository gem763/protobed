It\u2019s not been proved or debunked, but the threat is compelling enough that protesters have toppled 20 such lampposts since their rollout in July. \u201cI think that [smart lampposts are] just a trick the government is using to spy on us. It invades our privacy,\u201d a protester who gave the name \u201cNick\u201d told the Hong Kong Free Press. Nicholas Yang Wei-hsiung, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for innovation and technology, has denied the claims, the South China Morning Post reported, dismissing them as \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter thread posted last week, Chris Lau, a reporter with the South China Morning Post, filmed protesters dismantling a lamppost. Holding umbrellas, a handful of them obscured the person holding the saw, while others circled the group, likely lookouts for intervening police. In the footage, sparks fly and protesters exclaim, then cheer, when the lamppost falls. Last week, TickTack Technology Limited, a local firm that was supplying parts for the smart lampposts, announced that it was terminating its contract with the Hong Kong government after furnishing supplies for only 50 of the 200 posts it promised. TickTack representatives said in addition to the property damage the company has suffered, its employees have received threats. (TickTack did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Atlantic.)\n\nThe Hong Kong government has acknowledged that the lampposts have enough hardware to spy on citizens, but says protesters\u2019 fears are unfounded. In July, as the first wave of lampposts were installed around the region, federal officials promised to disable some surveillance features, including license-plate recognition and continuous audiovisual surveillance. Tony Wong, an assistant government chief information officer in Hong Kong, said in a recent press conference that the posts aren\u2019t capable of the invasive facial recognition deployed in China.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the buzz saws. On Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter, protesters have uploaded photos of the sawed-open guts of lampposts. It\u2019s risky to take crowdsourced information at face value in an environment so rife with propaganda and misinformation, but the posters speculate that these lamp innards reveal tracking technologies similar to the surveillance systems the Chinese government uses as part of its repressive campaign against the Uighurs, China\u2019s Sunni Muslim minority group.\n\nOf course, \u201cproving\u201d that the smart lamps use the same repressive technologies wielded against Uighurs requires dismantling and analyzing Chinese surveillance equipment, not just Hong Kong\u2019s. Pictures of RFID cards and ethernet cables don\u2019t demonstrate a direct connection. But suspicions of surveillance are compounding Hong Kongers\u2019 anxieties over the proposed extradition policy. They fear that easier extradition is a step toward second-class citizenship in a Chinese-controlled state.", "description": "For protesters, claims of Chinese surveillance are politically useful, even when they can\u2019t be proved.", "authors": ["Sidney Fussell"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_1163603517/facebook.jpg?1567195433"}
