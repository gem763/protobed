Cho was said to have told them around Monday lunchtime, just shortly before he publicly announced his resignation to the press at 2 p.m. that same day.Chung Kyung-sim, Cho\u2019s wife who was undergoing her fifth round of questioning when the statement was released, asked prosecutors if she could leave early, and went straight to the hospital, though for what reason was not immediately known.On Monday night, Chung, an English professor at Dongyang University in Yeongju, North Gyeongsang, uploaded a poem whose title translates as \u201cGo the Round Path\u201d by poet Park No-hae on her Facebook account along with a photo of a sunset.\u201cNo one can stay at the top of the mountain for long,\u201d the poem read, \u201cThe bliss of heaven is short. The pain of hell is short. [\u2026] So be bold. Under any circumstance, don\u2019t lose yourself. Under any circumstance, don\u2019t lose human dignity.\u201dAs prosecutors are expected to decide in the coming days whether to file for a pretrial detention warrant for Chung, Cho appears to be preparing to return to Seoul National University\u2019s law school, where he used to teach graduate students.Cho, who had taken leave from the prestigious public university, applied for a reinstatement on Monday, and a school official said Tuesday that his application had been approved. Cho will likely not teach any classes this semester because registration procedures for courses in the fall semester already wrapped up in early August.As the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office continues to probe the Cho scandal, prosecutors said Tuesday that two people linked with Cho\u2019s younger brother have been indicted on charges of receiving bribes from teachers at a school operated by the Cho family in exchange for their jobs.BY JEONG JIN-HO, LEE TAE-YUN AND LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
