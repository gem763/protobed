Set the tone with new season hues.\"\n\nThe ASA argued the phrase \"send nudes\" was likely to be understood as referring to requests for sexual photos, which could be a form of sexual harassment.\n\nIt acknowledged that the term \"nude\" was commonly described to refer to colours that were similar to some people's skin tones.\n\nBoohoo.com said its use of the word nude was solely to describe the colour resembling the wearer's skin, and reflected the trend for nude colours.\n\nThe ASA said: \"While the ad played on a well-known phrase to highlight a fashion trend, we considered the specific reference chosen had the effect of making light of a potentially harmful social trend.\n\n\"Furthermore, in the subject heading of an email, without any further context, the phrase 'send nudes' was likely to be disconcerting for some recipients, particularly those who might have personal experience of being asked to 'send nudes'.\n\n\"In the context of an ad aimed at a relatively young audience who were more likely to be harmfully affected by pressure to share sexual images of themselves, we considered that the reference to 'send nudes' was socially irresponsible and breached the code.\"", "description": "The advert for Missguided - shown during Love Island on ITV Hub - features bikini-clad models with their legs apart, while a Boohoo campaign has been banned for asking customers to \"send nudes\"", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Josie Clarke", "Image", "Missguided", "Asa", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20590017.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_objectified-women.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
