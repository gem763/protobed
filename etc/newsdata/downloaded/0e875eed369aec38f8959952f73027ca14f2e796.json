Screengrab from Facebook / Gov.sg\n\nThe Festival of Lights is just around the corner \u2013 and the government is back at it again with lighthearted films to commemorate the ethnic holiday.\n\nThe group of three short films made waves on the internet and earned praise from various netizens for successfully marrying humour with public messages.\n\nPublished last week by Gov.sg and People\u2019s Association (PA), they pay homage to popular Indian films while highlighting government schemes in a lighthearted way. But you don\u2019t have to be a Bollywood buff to appreciate their humour.\n\nI\u2019ve never watched any of the movies referenced in the short films, but found myself laughing at its magic arrows and vadai-making granny who upgrades her skills through government programmes.\n\nHere are some of the films\u2019 best highlights:\n\nOne of the videos, \u201cThe Royal Conundrum\u201d, was posted on the Gov.sg Facebook page last Wednesday (Oct 16), and features a comedic skit set in an Indian palace.\n\nWhen the king gets \u201cpoked\u201d by another king on Facebook, his wife advises him to give the other king cake instead of retaliating.\n\n\u201cBut our royal kitchen only has the grandma who makes vadai,\u201d the king replies, referring to the Indian fried snack.\n\ncaption Panic at the courtroom! source Screengrab from Facebook / Gov.sg\n\nOverhearing the conversation, the vadai-making granny was determined to save the day, and tells herself that she cannot remain \u201cstagnant\u201d.\n\nThus, she soups up her skills through Workforce Singapore\u2019s Adapt and Grow programme. In the end, she cooked up a Deepavali feast truly fit for kings and queens \u2013 and was henceforth known as \u201cGrandma Version 2.0\u201d.\n\nThe video was inspired by 2006 Tamil historical-comedy movie Imrai Arasan, which was well received by local audiences, The Straits Times (ST) quoted Soffy Hariyanti, director of campaigns and production at the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), as saying.\n\nIt is the first in a two-part series, with each short film lasting about one and a half minutes.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who shared the video on Facebook, called it a \u201cfun video with a serious message\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to prepare for economic changes by learning new skills and ad apting to new job demands,\u201d he said.\n\nThe second part of the Gov.sg series is titled \u201cWhat could go wrong at a Royal Deepvali celebration?\u201d\n\nWhen a royal guest falls ill while feasting, the king orders his delegates to bring the palace doctor.\n\nHowever, the guest refuses the king as it will be \u201cvery expensive\u201d \u2013 much to the ire of the ruler.\n\ncaption Doesn\u2019t this phrase ring a bell? source Screengrab from Facebook / Gov.sg\n\nThe king then orders his staff to get his \u201cmagical CHAS bow and arrow\u201d and takes his aim at the guest.\n\nBut\u2026it flies over his head and becomes fireworks which reveal Community Health Assistant Scheme (CHAS) cards.\n\nThe film makes reference to the 2015 hit movie Baahubali at the beginning, with the king cheekily asking: \u201cIf we use motion capture technology to show me fighting like Baahubali, will our people believe it?\u201d\n\nIt starred local actors and actresses like V.Mohan and Jamuna Rani, as well as Vasantham host-actor-singer Elamaran Natarajan and actress-host Jaenani Netra.\n\nAccording to ST, both videos were directed by Mr S.S. Vikneshwaran from local production house Cosmic Ultima Pictures.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to create videos with entertaining yet meaningful messages, which would resonate with viewers,\u201d ST quoted Soffy Hariyanti as saying.\n\nThe most recent video of the three was a heartwarming film posted by the People\u2019s Association (PA) on Saturday (Oct 19).
