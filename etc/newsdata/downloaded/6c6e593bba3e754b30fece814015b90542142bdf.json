Flight Forward can fly an unlimited number of drones, a key step toward expanding the operation. It can also fly drones at night - the company plans to do that after installing the necessary colored warning lights on each drone.\n\nHowever, UPS still faces severe restrictions before it can run a large commercial operation with drones.\n\nFor example, drones won\u2019t be allowed to fly beyond the sight of the operator without an FAA exemption for each route. Also, each flight will need a separate operator. Scott Price, the company\u2019s chief strategy officer, said UPS will eventually apply for FAA permission to have a single operator fly multiple drones at the same time.\n\nThe airline certificate lets UPS fly drones carrying more than 55 pounds, \u201cbut we\u2019re not comfortable we have the hardware for that yet,\u201d Price said in an interview.\n\nOperations will be limited to campus-like settings because FAA has not yet written regulations to allow commercial drone flights over populated areas. Price said UPS is eyeing \u201chundreds\u201d of such sites in the U.S., including hospitals, colleges and office buildings.\n\nPrice said the Wake Forest experiment has been successful, with only \u201ca few\u201d drone flights canceled for mechanical problems or because of bad weather. He said none have crashed. With a special FAA exemption, the company operated a drone flight there on Friday beyond the sight of the operator, which Price said was a first for a revenue-generating delivery.\n\nUPS believes the earliest commercially viable uses of drones will be for same-day deliveries, for augmenting truck-borne deliveries in rural areas, and for larger drones that could carry cargo of up to a ton from one rural area to another. Price said the latter idea is still years away.\n\nIn a press release issued by the company, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the airline designation, called a Part 135 certificate in FAA terminology, is a step forward in integrating drones into the U.S. airspace.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "UPS says it has won government approval to run a drone airline, a first for a U.S. company, and it plans to expand deliveries on hospital campuses and eventually other industries.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Koenig"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
