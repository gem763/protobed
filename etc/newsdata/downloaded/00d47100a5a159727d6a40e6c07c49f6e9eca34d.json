Surrounding communities are vulnerable to flooding. Discharges of polluted water from the lake, aimed at controlling its level, have spread harmful algae blooms to coastal areas in recent years.\n\nWith Dorian forecast to dump as much as 12 inches of rain in some parts of Florida, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the flood-control system, projects the lake level could rise 3.5 feet due to precipitation and runoff from the surrounding area.\n\nThe water level in the lake is currently about 13.7 feet. The Herbert Hoover Dike\u2014made of materials like gravel and limestone and outdated in its construction\u2014has had a history of problems when the water level exceeds 17\u00bd feet. If the water were to reach that point, it would trigger daily inspections of the dike to look for any potential vulnerabilities.\n\nFollowing Hurricane Irma in 2017, the lake\u2019s level reached 17.2 feet. That prompted the Army Corps of Engineers to discharge billions of gallons of water into the St. Lucie River, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean north of West Palm Beach.\n\nBecause of continuing projects to rehabilitate the dike, \u201cin general it is a little bit healthier\u201d than during Irma, said Col. Andrew Kelly, commander of the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 Jacksonville district, on a media call Friday. The agency says it has spent more than $870 million on repairs to the dike since 2001, and an additional $800 million in projects is planned.\n\nCol. Kelly said teams inspected the dike earlier this week, and personnel are in place to conduct assessments quickly after the storm passes.\n\nThe South Florida Water Management District, which manages water resources in an area that includes Lake Okeechobee, also has been preparing for Dorian. The agency has drawn down water levels in a large system of canals to better absorb the storm\u2019s rainfall, said Executive Director Drew Bartlett. It also has deployed staff to man pump stations when the hurricane hits.\n\nDischarges from the lake are possible, Col. Kelly said, but only when conditions downstream are deemed safe enough. The potential for more releases worries coastal residents in southwestern and southeastern Florida. The lake\u2019s water\u2014which is loaded with phosphorus, nitrogen and other substances carried in runoff from yards and farms\u2014has generated thick mats of smelly blue-green algae in those areas in recent years.\n\nWrite to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com", "description": "Hurricane Dorian could test the aging flood-control system around Lake Okeechobee in southern Florida, as rising water levels strain a dike vulnerable to seepage.", "authors": ["Arian Campo-Flores", "Arian.Campo-Flores Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103162/social"}
