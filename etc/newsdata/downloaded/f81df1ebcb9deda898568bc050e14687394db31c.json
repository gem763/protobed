Fireman Anthony Banas recently visited a preschool for a safety presentation and comforted three-year-old Kayli Templeton, who has autism and was overwhelmed\n\nFast friends! Kayli had been cowering in a corner but soon took to the kind firefighter\n\nKayli's mom Brittany Templeton told Fox 40 that the little girl was diagnosed just this September, and she has some sensory issues with sound and touch.\n\nAnd when her routine is interrupted \u2014 like when the firefighters visited for their safety presentation \u2014 she has a hard time.\n\n'We were showing the children our gear to make it less scary than it might be in a real situation, and I noticed Kayli in the corner with her teacher. She looked afraid,' 25-year-old Anthony told Yahoo.\n\nHe recognized some of the signs of autism because his 20-year-old brother is also on the spectrum.\n\nFamily: Anthony, 25, has a 20-year-old brother who is also on the spectrum, so he recognized the signs\n\nKayli's mom Brittany said she has a hard time with some noises and changes to her routine, but her heart was warmed that Anthony took care of her\n\nSuch fun! Kayli has since visited Anthony at the fire station and got to play on the truck\n\n'She didn\u2019t have that usual shyness of children her age,' he said.\n\nBut during a Q&A session, Kayli had warned up to to Anthony and walked over to give him a hug.\n\nSomeone snapped a photo and shared it on the Wheatland Fire Authority Facebook page, and the snap warmed Kayli's mother's heart.\n\n'There were new people in her regular environment asking kids to try this and do this which would be AWESOME to most kids \u2014 but for her it can be overwhelming,' Brittany explained.\n\n'This sweet man let her cuddle and relax right there on his lap for who knows how long because he could just tell she was having a hard time.\n\nNew obsession: Her mom says she's on a firefighter kick now\n\n'The department is right down the street from our home, so we will have to visit again,' she said\n\n'This sweet man let her cuddle and relax right there on his lap for who knows how long because he could just tell she was having a hard time,' Brittany said\n\n'As a parent, this kind of diagnosis can leave you wondering how each day is going to be. If someone is going to show her compassion, or judgement. And yesterday, it was compassion.\n\n'Anyway, it warmed my heart and I thought the community should know the story behind the photo they posted yesterday,' she said.\n\nSince the first meeting, Kayli has visited Anthony, who is also an emergency room technician and a Navy Reservist, at the fire department, where she got to play on the fire truck and had more hugs.\n\n'Kayli is on this firefighter kick now,' her mom said. 'The department is right down the street from our home, so we will have to visit again.'", "description": "Kayli Templeton has autism and struggles with changes to her routine.
