They also can tune in online, if they don't want to fly out to Vegas.\n\nJob Postings\n\nLyft (NASDAQ: ) has been cutting job postings since its less-than-spectacular IPO debut - no different from Uber (NYSE: ), which has also had rough go of it on public markets. In fact, some of the hottest sharing startups have disappointed investors in a big way. But still, it's telling to see listings fall at a startup that gained valuation and market share at such a fast pace. Investors may want to know..\n\nIs there still a growth story at Lyft? How will be grow?\n\nApp Store Rating Count\n\nLyft's Google (NASDAQ: ) ($NASDAQ:GOOG) Play App Store Ratings Count is up, and it's been growing - it should close in on the 200,000 mark somewhere before the end of the year... which, is where Uber (NYSE: ) ($NYSE:UBER)'s count was, for the same metric... in late 2015. So..\n\nCan Lyft (NASDAQ: ) make up the space between its market share, and Uber's?\n\nLyft Vs. Uber\n\nOur last one is a big one - both Uber (NYSE: ) and Lyft (NASDAQ: ) paced along pretty well, pre-IPO, in terms of their Google (NASDAQ: ) Play App Store Rating. But, in the last few weeks, it looks like it has begun to fall - for both companies.\n\nWhat is the company doing to keep users satisfied?\n\nThe answers to some of these questions may shed light on the company's planning, strategy and investments - or, it could signal a lack thereof.\n\nAbout the Data:\n\nThinknum tracks companies using information they post online - jobs, social and web traffic, product sales and app ratings - and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Thinknum covering: Alphabet Inc Class A, Alphabet Inc Class C, Uber Technologies Inc, LYFT Inc.
