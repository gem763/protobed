He discussed this with Miss Swift.\n\n'She asked if she could write the lyrics. She looked at the script \u2013 she'd obviously read a bit of Eliot,' he said.\n\n'Tom Hooper saw what she'd written and said bullseye! Or rather cat's eye. And that was it.'\n\nHe and Miss Swift worked on the song at his London residence and at the family estate in Sydmonton, Hampshire.\n\n'Once we got started, it got written pretty quickly,' he said.\n\n'Victoria sings the song to Grizabella, telling her that she has had wonderful moments and glamour in her life \"but I have had nothing\".'\n\nLloyd Webber said he worked with Dame Judi, Miss Swift and Miss Hayward on their interpretations of Beautiful Ghosts but stressed it was very much about how Hooper wanted them to sound.\n\nTaylor Swift, 29, plays the flirtatious Bombalurina in the star-studded film and worked on the song with Lloyd Webber at his London residence and at a family estate in Sydmonton, Hampshire\n\nAlthough the composer had approval over the music, two music producers \u2013 Greg Wells, who worked on The Greatest Showman, and Chic star Nile Rodgers \u2013 were also involved with the score.\n\n'I thought it best to let the music be thought through again, by other people,' Lloyd Webber said. He acknowledged that tastes had changed since he wrote the original score.\n\n'I really thought that for me to arrange the music for the whole thing, and pretend I was 30 again, was silly,' he said.\n\nOther stars in the film include Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, Ian McKellen, James Corden, Ray Winstone, Rebel Wilson and Jason Derulo.\n\nLloyd Webber has not seen the completed movie, which is in post-production 'more or less hand-painting the fur on to the actors, using computers' \u2013 the pictures on this page are promotional images.\n\nThe world premiere of Cats will be in New York on December 16.\n\nA gala in London will follow before the picture goes on general UK release on December 20.", "description": "BAZ BAMIGBOYE: When it came to writing a new song for the film version of his musical Cats, Andrew Lloyd Webber found the purrfect partner as pop star Taylor Swift was already in the cast.", "authors": ["Baz Bamigboye For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/22/20155292-0-image-a-12_1571952777998.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
