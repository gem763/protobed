(Thailand Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation)\n\nThe number of elephants in a Thai national park that died trying to save a baby elephant from drowning has risen to 11, officials said Tuesday.\n\nThai authorities on Saturday initially said six elephants were dead after a roughly 3-year-old elephant drowned at Khao Yai National Park, about 85 miles northeast of Bangkok. Five other elephants were thought to have jumped into Haew Narok Waterfall to try to save the baby.\n\nA drone has since located another five dead elephants near Haew Narok, the park\u2019s tallest waterfall, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOfficials on Saturday also found two live elephants on the waterfall\u2019s cliff, attempting to go down to help the other elephants. A veterinarian is caring for them.\n\n[A puppy trapped by Hurricane Dorian was found alive a month later]\n\nThe heightened death toll makes this the incident with the most elephant casualties at Khao Yai, where eight elephants fell to their deaths at the same waterfall in 1992, the AP reported.\n\nElephants are sympathetic animals that have been known to help each other when they are distressed. They also show something resembling grief when one of their own dies.\n\nThe discovery on Saturday was prompted by a report of several elephants on a nearby road, Thai officials said. The Haew Narok Waterfall was closed to visitors after the dead elephants were discovered.\n\nKhao Yai is Thailand\u2019s third-largest national park. Haew Narok has three tiers that total about 492 feet. Elephants are common nearby.\n\nRead more:\n\nWatch female elephants stage a dramatic rescue of a drowning baby elephant\n\nKangaroo \u2018carnage\u2019: 20 animals killed in apparent hit-and-run rampage\n\nThe creator of the labradoodle says he made \u2018Frankenstein\u2019s monster\u2019\n\nNorth America has lost 3 billion birds in 50 years", "description": "Elephants are sympathetic animals that have been known to comfort each other when they are in distress.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "October At Am", "Marisa Iati Is A Reporter For The General Assignment News Desk", "The Metro Desk.
