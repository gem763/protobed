REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah/File Photo\n\nIt was the latest gesture toward easing tensions by the Iran-aligned Houthis who have for over four years been battling a Saudi-led military coalition loyal to the Yemeni government that was ousted from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014.\n\n\u201cWe told the local mediators that we are ready to implement a prisoner exchange within one week. We are waiting for the other side to respond,\u201d the head of the Houthis\u2019 prisoner affairs committee, Abdul Qader al-Murtada, was quoted as saying by Houthi-run Al Masirah TV.\n\nHe said a deal would cover 2,000 prisoners in \u201ca first phase\u201d.\n\nThere was no immediate response from the Yemeni government.\n\nThe Houthis last month offered to stop launching missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia if the Sunni Muslim coalition ended air strikes on Yemen. They later released hundreds of prisoners in a move welcomed by the United Nations which is trying to revive a stalled peace process.\n\nYemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government and the Houthis agreed last December to a U.N.-brokered deal to exchange some 15,000 prisoners as part of trust building measures between the warring parties, but it has yet to be implemented.\n\nThe Houthi truce offer was extended after the movement claimed responsibility for Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Riyadh rejected the claim and instead blamed its regional foe Shi\u2019ite Muslim Iran, a charge Tehran denies.\n\nThe coalition has yet to respond to the ceasefire offer but senior Saudi officials have said they viewed it \u201cpositively\u201d.\n\nThe easing of Saudi-Houthi tensions would bolster U.N. efforts to pave the way for political talks to end the war that has killed tens of thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine in Yemen.\n\nThe coalition, which is supported by Western states, began its campaign against the Houthis in March 2015 but the conflict, which is widely seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran, has been in military stalemate for years.\n\nThe Houthis, who control most big urban centers, deny being puppets of Iran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.", "description": "The Houthi movement in control of Yemen's capital on Thursday offered the internationally recognized Yemeni government a prisoner swap involving 2,000 detainees after the group unilaterally freed hundreds of prisoners last month.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439438419&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF992C3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
