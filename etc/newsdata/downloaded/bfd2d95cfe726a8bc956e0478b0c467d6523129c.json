He will appear at a Brisbane court on 31 October.\n\nAuthorities did not name the man, but the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper has identified him as Maythem Radhi.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Should migrants to Australia face an English test?\n\nMr Radhi has denied responsibility for the deaths, and has been fighting extradition attempts for a decade.\n\nHe was granted refugee status in 2009 and had been living in Auckland with his wife and children.\n\n\"Let's not lose sight of the fact that more than 350 people died in this tragedy,\" Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said in a statement. \"They are owed justice and we remain committed to deterring those who profit from this trade.\"\n\nAustralian police have continued to investigate the incident, which took place while the boat was heading to remote Christmas Island.\n\nIraqi national Khaleed Daoed was extradited to Australia from Sweden in 2003 and given a nine-year prison sentence for the operation.\n\nAnother key organiser, Egyptian trafficker Abu Quassey, was convicted in his home country in 2003 and given a seven-year sentence.\n\nThousands of asylum seekers try to reach Australia by sea every year, many paying huge sums of money to people-smugglers to transport them.\n\nIndonesia is often used as a transit point as international borders in the region are hard to control.\n\nThe journey is fraught with danger and Australian authorities frequently conduct rescue operations to assist those trapped at sea.\n\nBut immigration continues to be a divisive issue in Australian politics. Australia has also been criticised for its policy of mandatory detention for those arriving without a valid visa.", "description": "Police said he was part of a smuggling operation which led to the deaths of over 350 people in 2001.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/48CF/production/_109293681_gettyimages-1153996403-594x594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
