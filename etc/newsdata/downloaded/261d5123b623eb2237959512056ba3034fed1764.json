If you met him, you knew him, you remembered him. His smile, his laugh, the encouragement he offered with words or even without,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe had an untamable grand personality and dreams to match. And he hated being put in a box.\u201d\n\nTobyMac, whose real name is Toby McKeehan, went on to discuss his son\u2019s musical talents and intimate relationship with God.\n\n\u201cHe expressed himself through the music he made. And by made I mean, written, recorded, produced, mixed, and designed the art,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAll of it. A true artist. His first show was a week ago, and it was nothing short of electric. Everyone felt it, everyone knew it.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nHe could\u2019ve easily taken the easy route and put music out when he was 12, 14, 16, even 18, but he always said he wanted to live some life and have something to say before he did it. He didn\u2019t want to be a child star, he wanted to be a man with scars and a story to tell. I always admired, respected and encouraged that stand. Truett always had a soft spot for God. The Bible moved him. His heart was warm to the things of his King. He was by no means a cookie-cutter Christian but give me a believer who fights to keep believing. Give me a broken man who recognizes his need for a Savior every time. That\u2019s who Truett was and how he should be remembered.\n\nTobyMac is best known for his singles \u201cMe Without You,\u201d \u201cLove Broke Thru,\u201d and \u201cI Just Need U.\u201d He released his eighth studio album in October last year, entitled The Elements.\n\nThe 55-year-old also shared his son\u2019s heartbreaking final text message to him, where he told his father how he made him \u201cfeel like a superhero.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you Dad. Thank you so much,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlways believed in me. Made me feel like a superhero.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "TobyMac penned a moving tribute to his son\u00a0Truett McKeehan, who died on Wednesday at his home in Nashville aged just 21.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/tobymacson1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
