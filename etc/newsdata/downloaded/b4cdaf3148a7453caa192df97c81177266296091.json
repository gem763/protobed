It\u2019s just the next game,\u201d the German revealed as he prepares for the trip to Bramall Lane.\n\n\u201cThank God we lost from time to time in the Champions League or other cup competitions, because we still know how it feels. That\u2019s really important because we want to change things when we lose a game.\n\n\u201cWe just want to go to Sheffield and make their life as uncomfortable as possible. That\u2019s the plan. We are considered as a top team but we don\u2019t want to behave like a top team. We want to fight like a proper challenger.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why there should be an advantage for Sheffield besides the fact they are playing in their own stadium.\n\n\u201cIs it allowed that they fight more than us? No. Is it allowed that they run more than us? No. Is it allowed that they just do more than us? No.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe must be there, absolutely spot on. That\u2019s the plan. We planned the week so the boys will be ready. Now we go there and we are really looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nKlopp has seen his team open up a five-point gap over City in second, but he is likely to resist the temptation to give more game time to a string of youngsters who impressed midweek in the Carabao Cup against Milton Keynes Dons.\n\nDefender Ki-Jane Hoever was on the scoresheet while 16-year-old midfielder Harvey Elliott was another to impress in a 2-0 victory.\n\n\u201cI think they are ready. But you need to find the right moment. They have to learn and develop a lot,\u201d Klopp added.\n\n\u201cIt was really nice [at MK] I think for Harvey it was the most obvious with the things he did on the pitch. We are not in doubt about these boys, and we know what we want to do with them and what we expect from them. But the best news is that they have all the time in the world.\n\n\u201cThey are part of a really strong squad and it is not easy to come into a team like this. But they are as close as they have to be. We work hard with them so they can make the next steps.\n\n\u201cThey have to be patient, but you see when you let them off the leash, they are obviously ready for some really nice football things.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go but we don\u2019t prepare them for one Premier League game, we prepare them for a Premier League career, in the best way we see. That\u2019s what we want.\u201d", "description": "Anfield boss believes cup setbacks will drive them on to push for further improvement in the quest for more honours", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KRxL2WDb7xUOsLpJEBh2TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uCClR_soV3qZtTdvjg2EQw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/b51fdfdbd4439522024b636938ab4cfc", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
