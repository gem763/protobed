An estimated forty-seven million Americans are currently living with this type of preclinical Alzheimer's. No drug exists to help them.\n\nSome may be experiencing the subtle signs of cognitive loss; others are still blind to growth of the devastating plaques and tangles destined to steal their memories.\n\nEvidence is growing that certain lifestyles changes such as diet, exercise and brain training might slow their mental decline, possibly even protect them from developing full-blown dementia.\n\nBut does one size fit all? Or do we each need a unique plan of action tailored to our specific risks factors?\n\nIsaacson bet on the latter. Since 2013, clients at his Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic undergo batteries of physical and mental tests. MRI scans are run to check for early signs of amyloid plaque buildup. Current and past medical problems, genetics, family history, nutritional patterns, exercise habits, levels of stress and sleep patterns are documented.\n\nThey are also asked if they want to participate in a study.\n\n\"Our study was designed to look at the effects of lifestyle intervention on cognitive function,\" Isaacson said. \"Does cognitive function go down? Does it stay the same or could it possibly improve?\"\n\nIsaacson and his team were able to enroll 154 patients between 25 and 86, all with a history of Alzheimer's in their families. Most were not yet experiencing memory loss, but showed worrisome performance on cognitive tests.\n\nA small group of 35 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The Alzheimer's Association defines MCI as \"cognitive changes that are serious enough to be noticed by the person affected and by family members and friends, but do not affect the individual's ability to carry out everyday activities.\"\n\nBased on those results, each person was given a personalized prescription plan. Out of nearly 50 evidence-based interventions, each person was given 21 lifestyle behaviors to implement.\n\n\"Physical activity and nutrition were by far the two most important things on the list, but those were also personalized for each individual,\" Isaacson said.\n\nIn physical activity, for example, the program might recommend aerobic interval training for one person, while using a balance ball or standing desk weight training might be recommended for another.\n\n\"Within dietary, we might say to consume caffeinated coffee only before 2 p.m. to protect sleep. No carbohydrates for 12 or more hours a day -- that's the intermittent fasting protocol,\" Isaacson said.\n\nThe program looked at alcohol intake, dairy intake, minerals and vitamins, sleep hygiene tips, education to learn something new, listening to music, meditation, mindfulness, and more.\n\nResults were hopeful\n\nIsaacson found people with diagnosed mild cognitive impairment who did at least 17 out of 21 behavior changes had better memory and thinking skills 18 months later.\n\nThose with MCI who did less than 17 of the personalized behaviors showed no improvement. In fact, they continued to decline.\n\nThe second group of patients with genetic risk but no current clinical signs of dementia, called the prevention group, were able to get an equally impressive cognitive boost. It didn't seem to matter if they followed less than 60% of the recommendations.\n\nIsaacson is cautious about overstating the meaning of these results. The study was not designed to prevent Alzheimer's, only to see if lifestyle changes affected cognitive function.\n\n\"We need more research, we need more clinics and more physicians to do it,\" he said. \"But I think this model is a roadmap for physicians and patients to work together to improve their brain health.\n\n\"We envision a day where people can go to their doctor and instead of hearing there's nothing you can do , the doctor will say, 'Well, we may not have the perfect answers, but here are 21 different things you can do based on your individual risk to protect your brain health.'\"", "description": "Following personalized lifestyle behaviors for 18 months improved memory and thinking skills in people who are at risk or showing early signs of dementia that can lead to Alzheimer's.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140318154551-alzheimers-0317-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
