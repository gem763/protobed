Whatever happens in the next few days in our negotiations with Europe \u2013 and I\u2019m in the \u2018Get the blessed thing done\u2019 camp \u2013 our economic future will depend on the UK being the place where the world can do business.\n\nThat means being open to foreign capital and it means being a magnet for global talent. This is important for our own prosperity, for we have to earn our living in an ever more competitive environment.\n\nBut it is also important for the rest of the world. A functioning global economy needs international hubs, and for all sorts of reasons \u2013 language, time-zone, legal system, pool of talent \u2013 the UK provides the best hub the world has right now. It can become even better in the future.\n\n'Whatever happens in the next few days in our negotiations with Europe, our economic future will depend on the UK being the place where the world can do business'\n\nThe City Corporation\u2019s strategy to attract more Chinese business to London fits into this wider vision and deserves a welcome. But what we need to do is much broader than being a shop front for Chinese capital.\n\nGlobalisation is shifting its nature from moving goods around to moving ideas. There are rising trade barriers on goods, and we cannot assume that the rumbling trade war between the US and China will subside any time soon.\n\nThat makes it more important that there should be greater freedom for trade in services \u2013 a world where know-how, finance and highly skilled people move as freely as possible.\n\nThe UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world, after the US. That is not a bad base to build on. This should not mean making a choice between Europe and the US, or the US and China.\n\nThe plain fact is that the US is the world\u2019s largest economy, bigger than Europe and bigger than China. That pecking order will change. In absolute size, China is likely to overhaul the US in about ten years\u2019 time, and pass Europe within about five years. But all are important now and will be in the future.\n\nOur job is to be useful to everyone: those three big blocs, of course, but also the rest of the world, including that other rising star, India.\n\nTo make this global vision work we have to do two things. One is to be genuinely welcoming at every level. It is no good keeping people queuing at Heathrow for an hour for immigration. It is no good saying to Europeans who have lived in the UK for many years, \u2018Sorry, chum, if you don\u2019t get settled status by the end of 2020 you\u2019ll have to clear off.\u2019\n\nThe other thing is this has to work for everyone, not just people in finance or technology and not just for London and the Home Counties.\n\nThere is a huge skill base across the land: Edinburgh University is now 20th in the latest QS global rankings; Manchester University is 27th. And it has to work for all job levels, not just for urban professionals.\n\nA good pub in Cornwall contributes to its customers\u2019 well-being, and the people running it need to be respected and rewarded. We are too uneven, and we need to tackle that.\n\nSo this is not just about getting Chinese companies to come to the City. It is about an openness of mind towards the changing world. We should celebrate what we do best, and welcome others who come and want to do their best. Done right, this could be an exciting ride.\n\nDyson's electric cars\n\nMaking electric cars is not difficult. In fact, it is too easy. That is what Sir James Dyson has discovered.\n\nHis decision to shut down his plan to do for cars what he has done for vacuum cleaners, hand-dryers and other products carries a wider message.\n\nDyson could build a fine electric car. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But he wisely concluded that he couldn\u2019t make money out of it.\n\nThe message is clear. First, electric cars are inherently much simpler products than petrol and diesel ones.\n\nThey have about one third of the parts. So to make money you have to have huge scale, something that Dyson could not achieve.\n\nNote that the only entirely new company making electric cars, Tesla, is struggling to make a profit \u2013 despite its iconic products.\n\nThe other is while the switch to electric vehicles will eventually happen, it may be rather slower than enthusiasts predicted and hoped.", "description": "We must look outward to the world.
