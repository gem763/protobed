The agreement has not specified the area of its pullback.\n\nKhalil, the SDF official, said his force would withdraw and move back 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the border after the planned evacuation.\n\n191019062827691\n\nHe said only after that would his force pull back from a 120km (75-mile) area between the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad.\n\nThis is the first time the Kurdish force has publicly acknowledged it will withdraw from the border, saying it has coordinated with the Americans.\n\nPrevious agreements between the US and Turkey over a \"safe zone\" along the Syria-Turkey border floundered over the diverging definitions of the area.\n\nKhalil said a partial evacuation happened earlier on Saturday from Ras al-Ain after much stalling and with US coordination.\n\nTurkish soldier killed\n\nOne Turkish soldier was killed and another wounded after an attack by the YPG group in northeast Syria's Tal Abyad, the defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nThe ministry said the attack with anti-tank and light weapons struck Turkish soldiers carrying out a reconnaissance and surveillance mission in Tal Abyad.\n\nIt said the attack was retaliated, and added that Turkey remained committed to the truce deal despite the violations.\n\nTurkey launched its cross-border offensive on October 9, aiming to clear the region of YPG fighters.\n\nThe campaign, dubbed Operation Peace Spring, would also allow the repatriation of Syrian refugees, according to Turkish officials.\n\nHowever, there are fears the offensive may result in mass displacement of people and the revival of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS) group.\n\nOn Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would press on with its offensive and \"crush the heads\" of Kurdish fighters if the deal on the withdrawal was not fully implemented.\n\n\"If it works, it works. If not, we will continue to crush the heads of the terrorists the minute the 120 hours [of the ceasefire] are over,\" Erdogan told supporters in the central Turkish province of Kayseri.", "description": "SDF official says forces will pull back 30km from the border in accordance with deal once Turkey lifts siege.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/20/cc12a4db16f548d0b3f21a80e60e9535_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
