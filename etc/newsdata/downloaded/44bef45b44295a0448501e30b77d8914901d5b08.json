Barrett, the center\u2019s deputy director. \u201cMemes, in turn, are a popular vehicle for fake quotes and other disinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstagram, more than its parent, Facebook, will be the vehicle of choice for people who wish to disseminate meme-based disinformation,\u201d his report warned.\n\nSpokespeople for Facebook and Instagram did not immediately answer messages requesting comment.\n\nLaunched in 2010, Instagram was purchased by Facebook less than two years later for $1 billion. The image-sharing app\u2019s audience has since swelled to about 1 billion active users, or a little less than half the number who regularly use Facebook\u2019s flagship social network.\n\nFacebook previously acknowledged that both platforms were abused by Russian internet trolls who bought advertisements shown to American users during the 2016 U.S. presidential race, and the Department of Justice has since filed related criminal charges against more than a dozen individuals and entities sought responsible.\n\nYet while discussions surrounding the Russian trolls have largely focused on their activities across Facebook, the Stern Center\u2019s report is hardly the first to raise concerns about the role of Instagram in elections past and future.\n\nA report produced for the Senate Intelligence Committee and released late last year found that Instagram outperformed Facebook during the 2016 campaign in terms of generating user engagement, \u201cindicat[ing] its strength as a tool in image-centric memetic warfare.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur assessment is that Instagram is likely to be a key battleground on an ongoing basis,\u201d the 2018 report found.\n\nMore recently, Facebook\u2019s former head of security questioned in an interview released last week if Instagram is ready to avoid being exploited during the 2020 presidential race.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the Russian troll factories have professional meme farms. Like they have graphic designers using Illustrator all day to create memes. So, \u2018Is Instagram ready?\u2019 is actually a big question,\u201d Alex Stamos said in the interview released last Tuesday.\n\nFacebook has since unveiled new rules for political advertisers across both platforms meant to rein in abuse ahead of 2020.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
