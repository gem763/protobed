He said Canadians had sent a clear message of support for progressive policies.\n\nJustin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) Thank you, Canada, for putting your trust in our team and for having faith in us to move this country in the right direction. Regardless of how you cast your vote, our team will work hard for all Canadians.\n\nDespite Trudeau\u2019s attempt to strike a conciliatory tone, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer issued a stark warning to the Liberals. \u201cMr Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready, and we will win,\u201d Scheer told supporters at his concession speech.\n\nDonald Trump was quick to congratulate Trudeau for \u201ca wonderful and hard-fought victory\u201d. Although the two leaders have not had a warm relationship \u2013 Trump described Trudeau as \u201cdishonest\u201d at last year\u2019s disastrous G7 meeting in Quebec \u2013 the US president tweeted: \u201cCanada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!\u201d\n\nFour years after the Liberal leader swept to power promising \u201csunny ways\u201d after nearly a decade of Conservative rule, Trudeau struggled to inspire voters as he campaigned for re-election.\n\nTrudeau, 47, was endorsed by Barack Obama in the last days of the campaign, but his standing as one of the few remaining progressive leaders in a major democracy was undermined by the emergence of blackface images, and lingering criticism of his handling of a major corruption inquiry.\n\nBefore the vote, polls showed him neck-and-neck with Scheer. But with neither of the main parties reaching the number of seats needed for a parliamentary majority, Canada is headed towards a minority government, and Trudeau will be forced to co-operate with smaller left-of-centre parties to govern.\n\nPlay Video 1:28 Conservatives have put Trudeau on notice, says Andrew Scheer \u2013 video\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a much-needed chastening of the Liberal party,\u201d said David Moscrop, a political scientist at the university of British Columbia. \u201cSome of [the result] is a backlash against Liberal arrogance and entitlements. The Liberals set the bar so high they\u2019re bound to run into it.\u201d\n\nIn the final week of campaigning, Trudeau faced a strong challenge from the left-wing New Democratic party, led by Jagmeet Singh, which looked poised to peel away progressive votes from the Liberals.\n\nBut despite a surge in the polls in the final weeks of the campaign, the NDP was unable to convert that success into electoral wins. The party\u2019s 44 seats were nearly cut in half.\n\nThe overall result laid bare the deep divisions in the country: not a single Liberal was elected in the western Prairie provinces, which the Conservatives swept.\n\nTrudeau lost key cabinet members, including veteran lawmaker and public safety minister Ralph Goodale, 70, who was the only Liberal MP in Saskatchewan, where the local energy industry is increasingly at odds with federal environmental policies.\n\nIn Alberta, Amarjeet Sohi, the natural resource minister, and Randy Boissonnault lost their seats, a result that means the neither Alberta nor Saskatchewan will have representation in Trudeau\u2019s federal government, at a time of growing frustration in the economically strapped western provinces.\n\nJody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general and justice minister who was expelled from the Liberal party after publicly criticising Trudeau for his role in the SNC Lavalin scandal, was successful in her bid to retain her seat as an independent.\n\nThe first Indigenous person to hold one of the most powerful positions in government, Wilson-Raybould played a central role in one of the most damaging episodes in Trudeau\u2019s first term of office, when she testified the prime minister and his staff improperly pressured her to abandon the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC Lavalin.\n\nAfter she resisted, she was shuffled out of the position of attorney general and eventually ejected from the party.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Conservative leader Andrew Scheer supporters watch the election results come in at his campaign headquarters Photograph: Todd Korol/Reuters\n\nJane Philpott, the former treasury board president and close friend of Wilson-Raybould, was also booted from the party for criticising Trudeau. But her attempt as an independent candidate to keep her seat in Ontario failed, with a disappointing third-place finish for the one-time Liberal star.\n\nMonday\u2019s result marked a clear defeat for Scheer, whose campaign pledges to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes failed to resonate with voters. The Conservative party also took a heavy loss, with deputy party leader Lisa Raitt losing her race to former Olympic kayaker Adam van Koeverden.\n\nMeanwhile, Maxime Bernier, the leader of the populist People\u2019s Party of Canada, which critics have called xenophobic and racist, lost his seat. It means the former Conservative minister\u2019s newly formed party will have no presence in the House of Commons.\n\nAfter his landslide victory in 2015, Trudeau positioned himself as a progressive force in Canada and aboard: he welcomed Syrian refugees when the US and other countries were closing their doors, and he legalized cannabis nationwide.\n\nBut in a country heavily reliant on natural resources, his efforts to strike a balance on the environment and economy have been criticized by the right and the left. His government brought in a carbon tax to fight the climate crisis \u2013 but also paid billions to rescue a stalled pipeline project.\n\nMonday\u2019s result marks a significant erosion of support for the charismatic prime minister, but the narrow victory will be enough to ensure Trudeau\u2019s marquee policies \u2013 including the national carbon tax \u2013 are likely to remain in place.\n\nBut without his majority, Trudeau will have to reach out to other parties with a \u201cconfidence-and-supply\u201d deal in which junior partners will support the government on individual pieces of legislation, as opposed to joining in a fully-fledged coalition.\n\nSuch a deal will leave the leftwing NDP and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois holding the balance of power a minority government. The most likely ally for Trudeau is Singh, who has made a commitment to fighting climate change and funding healthcare key requires for co-operation from the NDP.", "description": "Liberals secure four more years in power despite lingering criticism over handling of corruption inquiry and blackface scandal", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco", "Moustafa Bayoumi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68878413870791b51b9044e4290e16c385888106/0_332_4310_2587/master/4310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b350ac45ce76308b97f01ffd5dfd889", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
