Cousins threw four touchdowns in the win.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys, meanwhile, lost 24-22 to the New York Jets. With his spleen now healthy enough to play, quarterback Sam Darnold made all the difference for the Jets, who also picked up their first win of the season.\n\nThe Cowboys and the Eagles fell to 3-3. The Giants are 2-2 after a Thursday night loss to the Patriots.\n\nThe bad news for the Redskins: They\u2019re already 0-3 in the division to start the year. And they didn\u2019t convincingly beat a team gunning for the No.1 pick.\n\nBut as the philosopher Kevin Garnett said, \u201canything is possible.\u201d\n\nRight, Josh Norman?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re headed in the right direction now,\u201d Norman said. \u201cWe have a win under our belt, that\u2019s one down. So we have \u2014 what, 13, or whatever more to go? Or not 13 but 10? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve got a lot to go.\u201d\n\nTechnically, the Redskins have 10 games left in the regular season. But hey, if the Redskins somehow make the playoffs, they\u2019d have three postseason games (the divisional round, the NFC championship and the Super Bowl) to win it all, granted they earn the first-round bye.\n\nMaybe, Norman was just counting those.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
