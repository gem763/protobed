He has a small twinge and we\u2019ll assess where he is a little bit later today,\u201d assistant coach Neal Hatley said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in really good spirits, moving well, and we expect Jack to be fit for selection as well. It\u2019s fantastic where we are \u2013 all 31 being available for selection at the end of the week.\u201d\n\nEngland have also been boosted by Mako Vunipola\u2019s return from the hamstring injury that limited him to 17 minutes of rugby since May 11 until he came on as a replacement against Argentina.\n\nThe Saracens prop was promoted into the starting XV against Australia and responded with a display brimming with high work rate and key interventions.\n\n\u201cWe were unbelievably impressed by Mako. He continues to go from strength to strength,\u201d Hatley said.\n\n\u201cAnd he needs to because Ellis Genge and Joe Marler have been ferocious in training and everyone\u2019s putting the pressure on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked before about this team of 31 and everyone\u2019s doing their part but Mako, when he plays well like he did, is a real force.\n\n\u201cWithout sounding massively blase about it, I wasn\u2019t surprised at the performance he turned in, but I can understand why people outside of our group would look at it and go \u2018that\u2019s a hell of a performance\u2019.\u201d\n\nEngland name their team to face New Zealand on Thursday morning.", "description": "Jonny May and Jack Nowell are on course to recover from knocks in time for the last four showdown.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/04/wire-19975142-1571629442-555_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
