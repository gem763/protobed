In the process our comrades have become victims in terrible circumstances,\" he said.\n\nHe added that homes, businesses and places of worship had been destroyed, and that an untold number of Ethiopians had been displaced.\n\nViolence erupted in Addis Ababa, the capital, and in much of Ethiopia's Oromia region on Wednesday after a high-profile activist accused security forces of trying to orchestrate an attack against him - a claim police officials denied.\n\nThe activist, Jawar Mohammed, is credited with promoting the protests that swept Abiy to power last year but he has recently become critical of some of the PM's policies.\n\nBoth men are from the Oromo ethnic group, Ethiopia's largest, and their feud highlights divisions within Abiy's Oromo support base that could complicate his bid for a five-year term when Ethiopia votes in elections currently planned for May 2020.\n\nOn Friday, Oromia police chief Kefyalew Tefera said 67 people had been killed there, including five police officers.\n\nHe said most of the dead had lost their lives in \"clashes between civilians\" rather than at the hands of security forces.\n\nHe also claimed that calm had been restored but the defence ministry announced Friday that it was deploying forces to seven areas to restore order, and reports of violence persisted through Friday night and into Saturday.\n\nAbiy was in Sochi, Russia, for the Russia-Africa summit when Jawar's supporters first started mobilising in Addis Ababa.\n\nPrior to Saturday's statement, he faced criticism for saying nothing about the unrest.", "description": "Ethiopian leader vows to bring to justice those responsible for this week's violence that left 67 people dead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/3/31/afc0f3cac96941d299af864b104c5cc2_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
