But over the next hour or so, the pain got worse, and I got pins and needles in my legs before they went numb.\n\n\u201cI knew then that something really wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\nAfter phoning 999, Olivia was taken to King\u2019s Mill Hospital in Mansfield, where an MRI scan revealed a mass restricting blood flow to her spinal cord.\n\nTransferred to the more specialist Queen\u2019s Medical Centre in Nottingham, she was given an emergency operation to find out exactly what the mass was.\n\nShe added: \u201cI was in so much shock over how I\u2019d been fine just a few hours before, and it was all happening so quickly that I didn\u2019t have time to really process it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t in the frame of mind to fathom it. It was terrifying, but I just went along with what doctors were telling me.\u201d\n\nOlivia was raced into theatre after she arrived at the QMC and had a four-hour operation, which saw surgeons \u201cdrill\u201d into her spine to remove the mass.\n\nThey determined it was a blood clot, which they said must have formed very quickly, given how rapidly she fell ill. Doctors still do not know why it happened.\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\n\u201cThe focus at first was just getting rid of the haematoma before it got any worse,\u201d Olivia said.\n\n\u201cParalysis had been on my mind as, when I arrived at hospital, I\u2019d been unable to feel my legs. But I thought that the feeling would come back after my surgery.\n\n\u201cIt was only when I came round and a doctor came to see me that it dawned on me it might not.\u201d\n\nFollowing her operation, doctors told Olivia that she had sustained a serious spinal cord injury, which had left her paraplegic \u2013 a form of paralysis affecting the lower half of the body.\n\nFor the next six weeks, she remained in QMC, recovering and building up her strength before being transferred once again, this time to Sheffield\u2019s Northern General Hospital in South Yorkshire for rehabilitation, where she remains today.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still no set answer about my paraplegia and whether I will ever walk again,\u201d she said. \u201cSpinal cord injuries are very complex, and every case is different.\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\n\u201cAt my last appointment, I was told that, although doctors are really pleased with the progress I am making in physiotherapy, I am working with a one to two per cent chance of walking again right now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all those little things people take for granted and don\u2019t even think of that have been the hardest. For example, my stomach muscles have gone so I can\u2019t hold myself up without leaning on somebody.\u201d\n\nOn the rehabilitation ward, Olivia\u2019s days are made up of a timetable of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and optional extras like hydrotherapy, wheelchair sports and educational talks.\n\nShe continued: \u201cAs soon as I was able to do so, I signed up to do some sports. It\u2019s helped get me active again, and also meet some people going through the same thing.\n\n\u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t been able to meet many other young women, which has been hard. It does give me hope to see people coming out the other side of a spinal cord injury and rebuilding their lives, but it would help to talk to other young women like me.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\nOlivia, who has only a one to two per cent chance of walking again, yet vows she will remain independent, said: \u201cI felt totally normal leading up to what happened. There was no reason to suspect what was coming.\n\n\u201cI went to the gym five times a week, looked after myself and had loads of outdoorsy hobbies. This just goes to show that it can happen to anybody.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what will happen next, or whether or not I will walk again. The main thing for me is to keep my independence.\u201d\n\nLosing the ability to walk has been hard to accept, but Olivia admits her main concerns were feeling like a burden to her loved ones - especially her boyfriend.\n\n\u201cThis has been so hard on my family and Tom. You never think at 26 you\u2019ll be dealing with your girlfriend becoming paralysed overnight,\u201d she said.\n\n\"Sometimes I feel like I\u2019ve ruined his life, but he has been there, carrying on beside me \u2013 and that\u2019s more than I could ever ask for.\u201d\n\nOne particularly challenging part of Olivia\u2019s ordeal has been the thought that it may potentially affect her chances of having children \u2013 something she had always dreamed of.\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\n\u201cI very much envisaged being a mum, but that\u2019s now a long way in the future,\u201d she added. \u201cI have to get myself back to where I want to be, and feel able to look after myself before I can think about looking after a child.\n\n\u201cPlus when that day comes, I will likely need carers to help me, which is something I find difficult as independence is so important to me.\u201d\n\nFor now, Olivia continues to work hard at her various therapies and has a provisional discharge date of December 3, which doctors are confident she will meet \u2013 meaning she will be home for Christmas.\n\nHer plan once she leaves hospital is to live with her parents while the home she bought with Tom is being adapted to cater for her new needs.\n\nTo help with the cost of the alterations she will need, as well as equipment like a lightweight wheelchair and standing frame, and the cost of ongoing physiotherapy, which she estimates will be around \u00a3100 a session, her best friend Rosie Bown (COR) set up a GoFundMe page.\n\nAlready, more than \u00a34,000 has been donated, and her loved ones have also planned a string of fundraising events, such as a marathon run and Bonfire Night event to help.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s generosity has been overwhelming,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThe donations have blown me away. The cards and messages wishing me well have been really comforting, too.\n\n\u201cMy family have been especially incredible. For the six weeks I was in hospital in Nottingham, they didn\u2019t leave my side. This has turned everybody\u2019s lives upside down, not just mine, but my loved ones have been my rock.\u201d\n\nOnce home, Olivia has vowed to grow as strong as possible in the hope that she will one day be able to enjoy the hobbies she once loved, like hitting the gym, or exploring the countryside.\n\nShe concluded: \u201cWhile nobody can say for sure what will happen in the future, I believe you get out what you put in, so I am doing everything I can to work hard and get strong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to have goals \u2013 however small they may seem \u2013 to get through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m determined to keep my independence, even if that means doing things differently. For example, I want to drive again, so have a plan to get a specially adapted car.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to be in the home Tom and I bought together. When I envisaged moving in to my first house with him, it wasn\u2019t like this at all. It\u2019s hard to know that he is there while I\u2019m in hospital, but people\u2019s generosity through GoFundMe will really help with the adaptations.\n\n\u201cThis has all been so incredibly shocking. People often think a spinal cord injury happens after a fall or some trauma \u2013 but they can affect anybody. I had no signs or symptoms at all until that night.\n\n\u201cNow though, I just want to work as hard as I can to get home in time for Christmas. \u201d\n\nTo donate to Olivia\u2019s page, click here", "description": "Olivia Langley, 27, initially thought she had a trapped nerve and took a painkiller, but later learned how serious it was", "authors": ["Ashley Franklin", "Image", "Pa Real Life"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761676.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Olivia-Langley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
