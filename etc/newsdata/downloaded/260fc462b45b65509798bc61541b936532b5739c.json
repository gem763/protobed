Pictured: Portia and Amelia, thee, at home\n\nAmelia started competition in beauty pageant at the age of two. Now three, the toddler sports expensive outfits, spray tan and makeup . Pictured at a pageant\n\nPortia applying makeup to Amelia's face. In order to fund her daughter's pageant run, Portia had to cut costs on other living costs such as furniture and food shops\n\n'For the pageants, I've got to be looking at a minimum of \u00a3500 for one outfit and for make-up, spray-tan and hair, they're around \u00a3100.\n\n'Shoes cost about \u00a330, photos are another \u00a325 and with travel on top is another \u00a320.\n\n'So we'll save where we can, so we can be sure Amelia can compete.\n\n'I know I'm quite tight when it comes to spending on other things such as food shopping but it's worth it.\n\nMother-of-two Portia waving on stage next to Amelia at a pageant. Portia, used to be a beauty queen herself, retiring from the pageant scene last year\n\nFavouring super savers deals instead of branded items, Portia said she would spend about \u00a330 on weekly food shops, cooking big meals for her family and freezing the left-overs\n\nAmelia showing off one of her pageant dresses. A dress can cost between \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 for Portia, but the mother won't spend any expenses\n\n'For the four of us, I'll cook a spaghetti bolognese, feed us all and I freeze another four meals out of it, same with curry dishes, casserole and soup\n\n'I'll bulk buy my meat and freeze it so I just have to top up on veg each week.\n\n'I don't buy branded items, and if I need new furniture for the house then I'll buy them second hand, never brand new.'\n\nThe tot's mother hit back at trolls, fiercely defending her decision to allow her tot to start competing at three-year's-old - complete with spray tan, makeup and daring outfits.\n\nAmelia stands still as her mother applies fake tan on her upper body. Portia hot back at critiques and said her daughter loved competing\n\nPortia explained that the pageant world was nothing as cut-throat or mean as it had been depicted before.

Amelia competing at a pageant\n\nPortia herself only stopped competing in pageants last year, and began her daughter's pageant career at age two - estimating she's spent around \u00a37,500 on her toddler's journey so far.\n\nSpending the small fortune on everything from dresses, shoes and hairpieces, to spray tans, entry and make-up, Portia claims her tot's a natural and loves the make up and glamour.\n\nReflecting on Amelia's most recent pageant last month, which saw her move into a new age bracket, mother Portia said, 'We did this one on the cheap side.\n\n'The entry fee, with the jackpot extra which essentially means she gets extra competitions to enter in came to about \u00a3145.\n\n'For her three outfits, we could have spent about \u00a31,500 but went nearer only \u00a3700 for this one.\n\nPortia said she was not pushing her daughter into competing, and that Amelia got into her costumes herself.

Preparing for a pageant is a really team effort, with the family pitching in, including Amelia's younger brother Coleson-Christopher, two\n\nThe toddler being crowned at a pageant. Portia said Amelia's father Jayce did not care for beauty pageants, but said it was because he had never seen her perform\n\n'Then I get her into her dress, and let her get comfortable.'\n\nPortia added, 'Amelia's dad, Jayce doesn't really agree with pageants, thinking if I'm going to get her into anything it should be something professional like dance not pageants.\n\n'But he's not seen her in one, so doesn't really understand it - Amelia is happy doing them, which is all that matters as you can seen how much she loves it.\n\n'Yet my son, Coleson-Christopher, two loves to help her practice for them at home.\n\n'It's worth it absolutely - we don't go without and we still have lovely home cooked healthy meals just like everyone else.\n\nGetting the toddler ready for a pageants is a serious business, which starts by two applications of spray tan\n\nAmelia looking at herself in a mirror. Portia said her relatives were very supportive of the toddler's pageants and would help with outfits and routines\n\nPortia in one of her pageants dresses. She said she wanted to get Amelia into modeling but said she turned to pageants instead\n\n'I just do it on a budget and love to see Amelia enjoying it - the community is like a family.'\n\nThe determined mother added: 'I wanted to get her into modelling initially but the work is more spasmodic and not as guaranteed.\n\n'Some people don't agree with the make-up but Amelia loves it.\n\n'They can call me a pushy mum, but at the end of the day, it's just like a dance competition with a crown at the end instead of a trophy.\n\nThe toddler playing around in one of her pageants' gowns. Portia said she felt spending less on food in order to afford the pageants was worth it\n\nAmelia in one of her outfits at home.
