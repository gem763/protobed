They have humiliated the country again. pic.twitter.com/rVLSXLDCVM\n\nNineteen Labour MPs, including Gareth Snell, Gloria De Piero and Ruth Smeeth, rebelled against the whip to help the prime minister to a healthy majority of 30 in the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill.\n\nDuring the debate, De Piero told Corbyn: \u201cI want to improve the deal so that it reflects the manifesto that I stood on and respects the referendum result, and so that we leave with a deal that protects jobs and trade.\u201d\n\nHe replied: \u201cI fully understand both her concerns and their concerns. I commend her for her work in representing that area and the obvious friendship that exists between her and all the people she represents; she is a great MP\u201d.\n\nSeven of the group subsequently published a statement saying that, while they had reservations about the deal, they believed it was right to allow it to continue to be debated, to \u201cgive us a proper chance to get a Labour Brexit\u201d.\n\nOnly five Labour MPs then supported the government\u2019s programme motion, which would have resulted in the deal being rushed through the House of Commons by the end of Thursday.\n\nLabour frontbenchers discussed the timing of a potential election at a testy shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, with Corbyn loyalists Laura Pidcock and Dan Carden calling for the party to back an early poll.\n\nCarden told colleagues the \u201creferendum first\u201d approach espoused by some of his colleagues was a fantasy, which wouldn\u2019t win a majority in parliament and which the government would anyway refuse to implement.\n\nThe deputy leader, Tom Watson, has argued publicly that it would be better for Labour to settle the issue of Brexit in a referendum and then contest a general election on a wider set of issues.\n\nAt the shadow cabinet meeting, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, clashed with colleagues over Labour\u2019s stance on a second referendum.\n\nAccording to those present, Corbyn opened the meeting by reminding shadow cabinet members not to stray from Labour\u2019s agreed policies in media appearances.\n\nStarmer then suggested existing Labour policy meant the party must support any amendment to the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill calling for a referendum on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, and then campaign for remain.\n\nBut in a debate that became fractious at times, according to two people present, Starmer faced a backlash from colleagues including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett.\n\nOne witness said Lavery accused Starmer of \u201cramming this policy down my throat for 18 months\u201d.\n\nIn the shadow cabinet discussions about whether Labour would campaign for remain against Johnson\u2019s deal, Lavery and Trickett pointed to the motion passed at last month\u2019s Labour conference in Brighton, which said: \u201cThe party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government.\u201d\n\nParty members backed the motion after Corbyn made clear he wanted the decision about its referendum stance to be taken after a Labour government came to power.\n\nThe shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, also expressed concerns about supporting a compromise similar to the Kyle-Wilson amendment.\n\nThe Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson previously suggested they could support Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement if it was subjected to a confirmatory referendum. But Corbyn said he would \u201ccaution\u201d MPs against being willing to accept that quid pro quo.\n\nQuick guide How is Boris Johnson's Brexit deal different from Theresa May's? Show Hide The new Brexit deal is essentially the old Brexit deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a link to the full text. The backstop is replaced The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly. Consent Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years. The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge. That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020. Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not. Checks on border, ports and airports Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d. Future trade deals The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched. Customs Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods. No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use. Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above. A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed. West/east trade The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated. VAT EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland. Single electricity market The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change. Level playing field This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement. Lisa O'Carroll Brexit correspondent\n\nAbbott said last month: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it\u2019s got a referendum attached. That\u2019s why I was against Kyle-Wilson.\n\n\u201cEither it\u2019s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market \u2013 or it\u2019s not. The referendum is not an end in itself. Kyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don\u2019t support it.\u201d\n\nStarmer, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have said publicly they would like to campaign for remain.\n\nBut Trickett said earlier this month that he did not support the idea of a referendum that would pitch Johnson\u2019s deal against remain.\n\n\u201cA referendum before the election would imply a Tory Brexit against remain. I believe that the majority in the country voted for leave \u2013 and I feel that a Labour Brexit can only be delivered by a Labour government.\u201d", "description": "Testy shadow cabinet meeting fails to support Keir Starmer\u2019s \u2018referendum first\u2019 stance", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "The Civil Servant", "Rafael Behr", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/800763c8b90674c49ac252ee345d438641ea2b9a/0_33_1650_990/master/1650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3067f6752342b5416eb2fc9cba17a21b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
