It\u2019s nice and refreshing.\u201d\n\nThe Strictly fan, who said it was her dream to appear on the show, added: \u201cFor them to message that kind of stuff rather than putting me down is really nice.\u201d\n\nMixed-race Alex, England women\u2019s second most-capped player, was targeted while analysing men\u2019s games on Sky Sports and the Beeb.\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\nBut the defiant star - partnered with pro Neil Jones - said: \u201cI know I\u2019m inspiring people. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t quit football. I knew the change I was making.\u201d\n\nOpening up about the abuse, Alex said: \u201cI had all of it, for being a woman on TV, for being a woman of colour on TV, that I\u2019m ticking a box, death threats. The lot.\u201d\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\nAlex became Sky\u2019s first female pundit on men\u2019s Premier League matches last year. And she was a mainstay of the BBC\u2019s World Cup coverage at Russia 2018.\n\nShe has been impressing with her skills on Strictly. However last night she was partnered with Kevin Clifton for her couple\u2019s choice dance to Ghostbusters in the Halloween Special after\n\nNeil injured himself rehearsing yesterday.\n\nIn a second upset, Will Bayley hurt a leg in rehearsals so also coudn\u2019t dance. He and Janette get a free pass to next week.\n\nAlex and now single Neil, 37, have formed a close bond - but brushed off talk they are more than friends.", "description": "The Sky Sports pundit has received support and kind messages following success on the BBC dancing competition, after speaking out on the racist trolling she experienced previously", "authors": ["Janine Yaqoob", "Image", "Bbc Pete Dadds", "Supplied Wenn"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732170.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_16372182-high_res-football-focus-201819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
