I hope to continue giving back to others and inspire more players to help in the community.\u201d\n\nThe award is named for a former Pittsburgh Pirates star outfielder and two-time World Series champion from Puerto Rico who died in 1972 at age 38 in a plane crash while trying to deliver aid to earthquake victims in Nicaragua.
