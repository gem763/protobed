In celebration, we would like to hear about your Eurostar experiences to France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nWere you on that first train to Paris and how did you feel about being in a tunnel under the sea? Were you trapped on a freezing train for hours in the tunnel in 2009 perhaps? Or the derailed train in 2000? Did you meet your partner on the train (and please can they be French and you be English, or vice versa)? Did you give birth - or were you born - on it? Did you sit next to someone famous, and if so did you say \u201cyou\u2019re a star\u201d?\n\nMore seriously, were you a refugee who came to Britain hidden in the Eurostar? Does it go past the end of your garden, and how do you feel about that. Or perhaps your house was knocked down to build it. Perhaps you have worked for Eurostar and have some great stories to tell. Or something else. We would love to hear from you.\n\nHow to get in touch\n\nShare your stories with us by filling in the encrypted form below \u2013 anonymously if you wish.
