He had been criticized by President Trump and his supporters - among them prominent Fox News personalities - for his coverage of the news.\n\nFor his Wednesday show, Carlson is reportedly planning to talk to Kelly about media bias. The conversation is likely to delve into her tumultuous 18-month tenure at NBC News.\n\nThe Peacock network\u2019s news division has been making headlines in recent days in the wake of Ronan Farrow\u2019s bombshell new book.\n\nIn Catch and Kill, Farrow accuses senior NBC News executives of suppressing reports of sexual abuse by former Today show star co-host Matt Lauer and disgraced Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nFarrow alleges that NBC News made numerous six- and seven-figure payouts to women who say they were victimized by Lauer.\n\nIt will be Kelly's first appearance on television since October 23, 2018, when she tearfully apologized for saying that it was once acceptable to wear blackface. NBC announced that her show would be canceled the next day\n\nHe also claims that NBC News, his former employer, tried to stop him from investigating Weinstein for fear that the film mogul would reveal details of Lauer\u2019s behavior and his boss\u2019s alleged coverup and attempts to silence women.\n\nNoah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, denies Farrow\u2019s allegations, saying they are a \u2018smear\u2019 and a \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 from someone with \u2018an axe to grind.\u2019\n\nFarrow\u2019s book contains more allegations against Lauer that were previously unreported, including an alleged rape of a female colleague in his hotel room in Sochi in 2014.\n\nLauer is also alleged to have exposed himself to a Today producer while the two were chatting in his office.\n\nBoth women were said to have received substantial payouts from the network which barred them from speaking to the press about their experiences with Lauer.\n\nKelly is reported to have angered her bosses at NBC News by inviting one of Lauer's accusers on her morning program.\n\nBefore joining NBC News, Kelly spoke of being sexually harassed by her former boss at Fox, the late Roger Ailes.\n\nKelly's former employer, NBC News, is under scrutiny after a new book by journalist Ronan Farrow alleges that network bosses knew of former Today co-host Matt Lauer's alleged behavior toward women and tried to cover it up through payouts and nondisclosure deals\n\nAiles resigned in disgrace in 2016 after at least 20 women, among them Gretchen Carlson, Kelly, and Laurie Luhn, alleged that they were subjected to unwanted sexual advances from the longtime Fox News CEO.\n\nKelly, whose short tenure at NBC News was marred by low ratings and rumblings of tension in the workplace, was paid a lump sum of $30million, which is how much was left on the original $69million contract she signed with the Peacock Network in 2017.\n\nShe was let go unceremoniously after she said during an October 23 taping of her show that that when she was younger, it was common for whites to dress up as blacks for Halloween and that there was nothing inherently racist in doing so.\n\nA fierce backlash on social media ensued, with many criticizing Kelly for failing to appreciate how blacks have historically been depicted with stereotypes that perpetuated racism.\n\nThe next day, Kelly held back tears as she apologized on air. That was her last appearance on NBC's air.\n\nKelly\u2019s exit from NBC News was finalized after months of painstaking negotiations over what she can say about her now-former bosses and colleagues.\n\nAs per the terms of her $30million severance agreement with the Peacock Network, Kelly will not be permitted to dish dirt about what took place behind the scenes at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.\n\nNBC management insisted in talks with Kelly that she sign the non-disparagement clause in exchange for her receiving the full sum of the original $69million contract she signed with the network in the summer of 2017.", "description": "The former prime time star who left Rupert Murdoch's cable network to go to NBC where she was fired for comments about blackface will appear on Tucker Carlson's show on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/02/19719046-0-image-a-28_1571102600906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
