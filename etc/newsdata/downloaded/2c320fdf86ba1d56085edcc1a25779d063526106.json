However, Iraq\u2019s military has cast doubt on that report claiming 61 bodies had been recovered and that explosive booby-traps set by the jihadists were responsible for the destruction of the buildings.\n\nThe US said on Saturday (March 25) that it was investigating an air strike on March 17 at \u201cthe location corresponding to allegations of civilian casualties\u201d.\n\nAccording to a monitoring group, nearly 700 civilians have died since the offensive in west Mosul began last month. Hundreds more are said to flee each day.", "description": "'Shelling' sparks a major fire among crowded market stalls in east Mosul, with both civilians and fire fighters battling to put it out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/361641/1000x563_361641.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-26"}
