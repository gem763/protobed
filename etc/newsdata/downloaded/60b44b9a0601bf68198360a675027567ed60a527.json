Here's how they spent the money.", "language": "en", "text": "Stockton, California, is distributing $500 monthly stipends to the city's poorest families as part of a basic-income trial .\n\nThe city just released results from the last eight months of that program: Most participants spent the money on food and clothing.\n\nCritics of basic income suggest that cash stipends reduce the incentive for people to find jobs.\n\nVisit Businessinsider.com for more stories.\n\nWhen Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs suggested giving residents in his California city $500 a month with no strings attached, he wasn't floating a new idea. The system of paying someone for being alive \u2014 now known as universal basic income \u2014 stretches back to the 16th century. Tubbs got the idea from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who proposed a guaranteed minimum income for citizens in 1967.\n\nToday, it's still considered a radical approach. The system's critics say it reduces the incentive for people to find jobs and uses up government funds that could be better spent elsewhere.\n\nStockton Mayor Michael Tubbs More\n\nBut the idea has gained a national platform in part thanks to presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who has promised to deliver payments of $1,000 per month, or $12,000 per year, to all US citizens over 18.\n\nTubbs' program, which started in February, could serve as a test case. For eight months, 125 Stockton residents living at or below the median income line (around $46,000 annually) have been getting $500 monthly stipends. The money is distributed through the mail in the form of debit cards.\n\nThis week, the city released the first set of data about the program. Most participants, it found, have been using their stipends to buy groceries and pay their bills.\n\nStockton's basic-income recipients spent the most money on food\n\nOn average, participants in Stockton's trial spent most of their stipends (around 40%) on food and another 24% on sales and merchandise, including trips to Walmart or dollar stores. Another 11% went to paying their utilities, and around 9% went to buying gas and repairing their cars.\n\nThat left around 16% to be divided among categories like medical expenses, transportation, education, insurance, recreation, and self-care.\n\nStockton California More\n\nAP Photo/Gosia Wozniacka, File\n\nOne resident, 48-year-old Zhona Everett, told the Associated Press that after paying her bills, she used the rest of the stipend to pay off her wedding ring and donate to her church. She also had enough money to go on a date with her husband, who works with her at the Tesla factory about 60 miles away.\n\n\"I was very excited to see it already working and making a difference in so many people's lives,\" Tubbs told Business Insider in April. \"I'm now much more resolute in this idea that, if it's not a panacea ... it should be considered as one of the many solutions to ensure that people have an economic floor.\"", "description": "Most participants of a basic-income trial in Stockton, California, spent the money on food and clothing.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AvnxOpfpq30J7z2yqnkbRQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/954d24feafcf89e8da2aee7819d7a4f2", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
