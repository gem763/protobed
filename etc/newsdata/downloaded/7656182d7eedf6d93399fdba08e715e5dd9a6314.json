We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit.'\n\nMcGowan was working on her memoir, Brave, in which she planned to publish her allegations against Weinstein between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe suit alleges that Weinstein and his attorneys were able to obtain a large part of the book before it was published, including using a 'spy' who got close to her by passing herself off as an advocate for women, Variety reports.\n\nIn a statement, Bloom's attorney Eric George told the Hollywood Reporter: 'It is inexcusable that Ms. McGowan chose to include my client in her lawsuit.\n\n'Facts matter. There is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client. We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.'\n\nIn January 2018, McGowan also revealed what allegedly happened between her and Weinstein at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival when her memoir Brave was published.\n\nMcGowan was one of the first women to publicly accuse movie mogul Weinstein of sexual misconduct when she alleged he raped her. They are pictured together at a 2007 event\n\nWeinstein's former lawyers are included in the lawsuit and McGowan claims they played a part in his efforts to limit the potential damage of the rape allegation she made against him\n\nShe wrote that she had an appointment with Weinstein on the day of the incident but arrived to learn her breakfast meeting had been moved to his hotel suite.\n\nOnce she got to the suite, she claims that Weinstein tore off her clothing, made her sit on the edge of the Jacuzzi in his room and proceeded to perform oral sex on the actress while masturbating himself to completion.\n\n'Mr. Weinstein denies Ms. McGowan's allegations of non-consensual sexual contact,' said Weinstein's rep in a statement at the time.\n\n'Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.'\n\nIn January 2018, McGowan also revealed what allegedly happened between her and Weinstein at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival when her memoir Brave was published\n\nSoon after this alleged assault, McGowan received a $100,000 settlement from the disgraced mogul.\n\n'I freeze, like a statue,' writes McGowan of the moments just before the alleged assault.\n\nWeinstein proceeded to strip naked according to McGowan, and directed her towards the Jacuzzi while ripping off her clothes.\n\nIn a story McGowan had previously hinted at on Twitter prior to her book release, she was taken to a photo call for her film Phantoms that was playing at the festival.\n\nIt was the New York Times that reported in 2017 about McGowan receiving a $100,000 settlement in the wake of the incident.\n\nThat settlement did not require her to sign an NDA, but McGowan very publicly threw caution to the wind in November 2017 by alleging on Twitter that Weinstein was her rapist.\n\nMcGowan said she found little help or support in the time after the alleged assault. She said she was told that no one would believe her in court while others 'counseled me to see it as something that would help my career in the long run.'\n\nIt did not help in the long run, with the actress' career reaching its height in 1999 with the cult classic Jawbreaker before she was relegated to television, where she starred in the highly profitable but 'deadening' drama series Charmed.", "description": "Rose McGowan has claimed Harvey Weinstein and his former lawyers conspired to discredit her and tried to steal her unpublished book to suppress the rape claim she made against him.", "authors": ["Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/22/20102396-0-image-a-95_1571864709135.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
