The camp here (at Leda) is very overcrowded. There are food and housing problems,\u201d the 50-year-old told AFP.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the UN, although Bangladeshi officials said they expect a delegation would visit the island in the next few weeks.", "description": "Cox\u2019s Bazar (Bangladesh) (AFP) \u2013 Thousands of Rohingya living in Bangladesh refugee camps have agreed to move to an island in the Bay of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/a1e1a7_rohingya-refugees-attend-ceremony-marking-anniversary-military-crackdown-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
