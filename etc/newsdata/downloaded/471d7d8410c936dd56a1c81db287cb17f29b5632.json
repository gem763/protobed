Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez released her Green New Deal there was a line about air travel that got a lot of attention. \u201cBuild out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary\u201d the summary stated. That line didn\u2019t appear in the resolution itself, but it signaled that maybe one of the goals of Green New Deal supporters was to do for air travel what Medicare for all would do for private insurance.\n\nThe reasons are obvious. While there are electric cars and electric trains that work well, there\u2019s no such thing as an electric passenger jet that can take you from the US to Europe. So if you\u2019re serious about reducing carbon emissions, then reducing or eliminating air travel is one of those problems you face.\n\nGreta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate change activist just completed a trans-Atlantic journey on a $4 million pound solar sailboat specifically so she couldn\u2019t be accused of hypocrisy on this point. The trip took her 15 days. What Thunberg didn\u2019t tell anyone is that her carbon-neutral stunt wasn\u2019t carbon-neutral at all. At least 2 people will fly to New York to bring the boat back:\n\nA spokeswoman for Team Malizia said it\u2019ll be necessary to fly the crew to the U.S. because the high-profile trip with the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner that left Plymouth on Wednesday was arranged at very short notice. Holly Cova told The Associated Press by email Friday that \u201cwe only have one boat, so they cannot easily sail over to meet them.\u201d\n\nBut the push to eliminate air travel to save the planet is on. Today, the Atlantic published a piece by a travel writer who feels guilty about his own hypocrisy:\n\nAs this summer\u2019s tourism season draws to a close, anyone in a half-sane society would choose this moment to stop going on far-flung vacations. That\u2019s a hard thing for a travel writer to admit. After family and friends, travel is pretty much my favorite thing\u2014not only my source of income, but an inexhaustible wellspring of curiosity, empathy, and wonder. Yet optional travel is also a major contributor to ecocide. Last year, a University of Sydney study examined the environmental impact of the many activities involved in tourism\u2014including transportation, shopping, and more\u2014and found that it accounts for 8 percent of all global carbon emissions, far more than previously imagined. The 100,000 flights a day that now crisscross the skies pump almost as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as the 28 member states of the European Union combined. (In the United States, at least, roughly half of all airline trips are for \u201cpersonal leisure purposes.\u201d) In May, a landmark United Nations report into collapsing biodiversity found that humans have severely altered or destroyed about 75 percent of the Earth\u2019s land; while human land use, including agriculture and ranching, was the greatest culprit, climate change was a significant factor as well. Moreover, while the report neglected to say so, the remaining 25 percent is hardly inviolate, as we scramble over one another to Instagram what idylls remain. \u201cGoing someplace far away, we now know, is the biggest single action a private citizen can take to worsen climate change,\u201d the journalist Andy Newman in wrote recently in The New York Times. \u201cOne seat on a flight from New York to Los Angeles effectively adds months worth of human-generated carbon emissions to the atmosphere. And yet we fly more and more.\u201d\n\nThe author concludes that he\u2019ll take the train wherever possible but will continue to fly when necessary, which of course will be all the time. But he laments that \u201cregular travelers like me are loving the world to death.\u201d\n\nSo the bottom line is this: If you have a $4 million pound solar sailboat you can at least pretend to care about reducing air travel. Meanwhile, the decline of oil production mandated by the GND will ensure that the cost of jet fuels rises to the point where few people can afford to take a vacation abroad even if they wanted to do so. Of course, AOC and her GND supporters won\u2019t admit that putting an end to your vacation plans is part of the agenda, but it is.", "description": "\"...regular travelers like me are loving the world to death.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Taylor Millard", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airplane-wing.jpg"}
