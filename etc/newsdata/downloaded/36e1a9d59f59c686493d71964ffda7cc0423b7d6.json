It doesn't cause smallpox but it is used to make the vaccine for the virus.\n\nA lab worker's finger began to rot after she accidentally injected herself in the finger with smallpox-related virus while experimenting with mice (pictured 54 days after the accident)\n\nThe 26-year-old's finger turned black and a puss-filled scab developed at the injection site as the infection ravaged the tip of her index finger (pictured after 25 days)\n\nDoctors put her on a course of antiviral drug tecovirimat for a fortnight, along with antiobiotics to prevent a bacterial infection in her wound. Here, it's pictured on the mend after 94 days\n\nShe rinsed her finger with water for 15 minutes immediately after the accident before being rushed to A&E.\n\nAbout 10 days later, the lab worker's finger had ballooned and a green blister had formed on the tip. It became increasingly itchy and she developed a fever.\n\nWhen her symptoms did not subside by day 12, doctors put her on a course of antiviral drug tecovirimat for a fortnight, along with antibiotics to prevent a bacterial infection in her wound.\n\nShe was also given a single dose of vaccinia immune globulin, which consists of antibodies derived from people already vaccinated against the disease.\n\nOn day 11, the tip of her finger ballooned and a puss-filled blister developed. She was also struck down with a fever\n\nWithin two days of treatment, the woman's fever vanished and the pain and swelling had mostly subsided.\n\nBut patches of dead tissue on her finger didn't completely heal for more than three months. She was unable to go to work during that time.\n\nThe tale was revealed in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe report claimed she was offered the smallpox vaccine before starting her work with vaccinia, but she declined.\n\nShe turned it down because she did not 'appreciate the extent of infection that could occur', medics revealed.\n\nThe woman was also put off by the thought of having to manage the potential side effects of the injection.", "description": "The 26-year-old, from San Diego, had unintentionally prodded herself with a needle while injecting mice with vaccinia virus as part of the experiment.
