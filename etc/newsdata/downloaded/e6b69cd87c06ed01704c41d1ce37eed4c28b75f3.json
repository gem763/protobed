Former Osprey\u2019s head coach Sean Holley tells us the right side won on the day but Wales can hold their heads up high, in particular Warren Gatland and Alun Wyn Jones, who Sean thinks has plenty of years left in the tank.", "description": "After six weeks of upsets, hammerings and cancellations we are down to just two teams in the 2019 Rugby World Cup final:", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IHuFKt4yi4U/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
