But there\u2019s a bit more to this one.\n\nMicrosoft has emerged victorious in a dramatic competition for public cloud resources for the U.S. Defense Department, beating out market leader Amazon Web Services, the Pentagon said on Friday. The contract could be worth as much as $10 billion over a decade, according to a statement. [\u2026] Early in the process Amazon was seen as the favorite, partly because its AWS business won a deal with the CIA in 2013. Also Amazon had been certified at the highest existing security clearance level, while Microsoft sought to catch up.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that Microsoft won the contract strictly on the merits and there\u2019s no concern about possible presidential corruption. That said, Donald Trump hasn\u2019t exactly made it easy to believe the most benign interpretation of events.\n\nLet\u2019s back up and review how we arrived at this point. As regular readers may recall, about a year into Trump\u2019s presidency, Axios spoke to five sources close to the White House who said the Republican is eager to \u201cgo after\u201d Amazon.com and its CEO, Jeff Bezos. Referring to Trump, one source said at the time, \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with Amazon. Obsessed.\u201d\n\nThe article added, \u201cThe president would love to clip CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 wings. But he doesn\u2019t have a plan to make that happen.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s preoccupation with Bezos has always been a little weird. It\u2019s effectively a political bank shot of presidential contempt: the Republican hates the Washington Post\u2019s coverage of his administration, which leads Trump to hate its owner, which then leads the president to also hate Bezos\u2019 other businesses, including Amazon Web Services.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that Trump announced in July \u2013 just as the Pentagon was reportedly prepared to announce a decision on the JEDI contract \u2013 that he was looking \u201cvery seriously\u201d at intervening in the contracting process because unnamed people had told him \u201cit wasn\u2019t competitively bid.\u201d\n\nEven at the time, the comments suggested that Trump has no idea what he was saying. There was a competitive bidding process, and no company had secured the contract.\n\nNevertheless, on the heels of the president\u2019s comments, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he intended to review the contract. According to a Washington Post report, the Pentagon chief\u2019s reexamination was the result of White House instructions and \u201c11th-hour Oval Office intervention.\u201d\n\nThere were \u201cconcerns\u201d in the West Wing, the article added, that the lucrative contract \u201cwould go to Amazon.\u201d\n\nNow we know that the lucrative contract did not, in fact, go to Amazon, and it\u2019s hard not to wonder whether the president\u2019s contempt for the Washington Post had at least something to do with the decision.\n\nComplicating matters, Task & Purpose got an advance look at Holding The Line: Inside Trump\u2019s Pentagon with Secretary Mattis, written by Guy Snodgrass, who served as the communications director for former Defense Secretary James Mattis. There\u2019s an anecdote in the book that alleges Trump called Mattis last summer and directed him to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d out of the JEDI contract.\n\nThe book reportedly adds that Mattis ignored the directive. Of course, Mattis is also no longer at the Pentagon.", "description": "If Trump played a role in steering a Pentagon contract away from Amazon, it could add to the questions about the president's alleged corruption.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/2012/10/121022-pentagon_0.jpg?itok=WTRyDk7g", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
