Earlier this year, Kangmei Pharmaceutical, a Chinese company included in MSCI indexes, had over $4.4 billion go \u201cmissing.\u201d While the company called it an \u201caccounting error,\u201d China\u2019s late-to-the-party regulator called it a \u201cpremeditated and malicious cheating of investors.\u201d How many more of these companies will have their cash go missing when the CCP determines their useful life has come to an end? As more frauds emerge, it will be America\u2019s mom-and-pop investors who get stuck holding the bag, with limited legal recourse. It defies logic to think that retail investors are exposed to this type of risk 11 years after a financial crisis triggered by asset-backed securities filled with fraudulent mortgages.\n\nIncredibly, the diligence failure doesn\u2019t stop there. As if ignoring the risk of fraud isn\u2019t bad enough, the indexes also include companies placed on the U.S. government Entity List and OFAC Sanctions List. This generally happens when a company is \u201cacting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States\u201d or is a \u201cthreat to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the U.S.\u201d Yet, American investor money continues to flow into these companies. Does that make sense to anyone, except those profiting from it? Do Americans even know that when they buy a global index ETF they could be investing in adversarial state-controlled companies like Rosneft, Gazprom, ZTE, Hikvision, or Aviation Industry Corporation of China?", "description": "", "authors": ["Christopher Iacovella", "Realclearpolitics.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
