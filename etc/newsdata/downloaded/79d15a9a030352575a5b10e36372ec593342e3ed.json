Up until now, it has been kept partially secret \u2014 via heavy redactions \u2014 and you can well see why our corrupt, failing, self-serving Establishment has been so reluctant to publish it, the police especially.\n\nIt is, quite likely, the most shaming, damning, embarrassing indictment of police incompetence and stupidity since Sir Robert Peel founded the Metropolitan Police over two centuries ago.\n\nTo appreciate how embarrassing, here\u2019s a thought experiment. Suppose a random guy were to claim to the FBI that he had been sexually abused by a secret, murderous ring of supposed high-level paedophiles including the late President Ford, General Petraeus, Rush Limbaugh, Richard Simmons, John Brennan and George Foreman, how do you think they\u2019d respond?\n\nYes, I know the FBI has problems of its own, but I think pretty soon that they would form the impression that the guy making these ludicrous claims was a crackpot.\n\nThey would conduct the interviews with due scepticism; they would investigate his claims and see whether there was any evidence whatsoever to corroborate them. And in the absence of this evidence they would tell the nutjob where to go. Or possibly prosecute him for wasting police time.\n\nNot so the British police. Presented with a similar lunatic paedophile ring scenario to the one I\u2019ve just outlined above, they decided to \u2018believe the victim\u2019 by default and squander \u00a32.5 million investigating \u2014 or rather not investigating \u2014 allegations so ridiculous that even an amoeba with learning difficulties would laugh them out of court.\n\nThe protagonists in this high level Paedo Ring of Doom scenario according to the complainant \u2014 a chap named Carl Beech \u2014 included the following: Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former head of the Army who was wounded on D-Day; Harvey Proctor, a mild-mannered, gay former MP; Paul Gambaccini, a DJ; Leon Brittan, a former Home Secretary; Edward Heath, formerly a Prime Minister; and the former heads of MI5 and MI6.\n\nTogether, apparently, this cabal had met to torture and sexually abuse Carl on a regular basis. On one occasion, they presented Carl and three other boys with a terrible dilemma: \u2018We were told that one of us was going to die and we had to decide which one.\u2019 They then \u2013 allegedly \u2013 beat one of the other boys to death. Proctor, so Beech told police, was the most sadistic. On another occasion he tried to chop off Beech\u2019s testicles with a pair of scissors, only to be dissuaded by former Prime Minister Ted Heath.\n\nDoes any of this sound remotely plausible?\n\nThe police decided it was, one senior officer going so far as to declare at a press conference that Beech\u2019s evidence was \u2018credible and true.\u2019\n\nSome junior officers expressed doubts. One said it all sounded a bit like something from the BBC spy series Spooks. But the senior echelons of the police, including the chiefs of more than one constabulary, were thoroughly convinced that if a random stranger claims a backbench MP once tried to chop off his balls with a pair of scissors only to prevented at the last minute by the Prime Minister while various senior army officers looked on then the balance of probability is that this is what happened.\n\nAs a result all the famous names traduced by Carl Beech \u2014 those that weren\u2019t fortunate enough to have died beforehand \u2014 had their reputations dragged through the mud, their livelihoods ruined, their families traumatised, their time and money squandered in police interviews and legal costs. So now having forked out \u00a32.5 million on an investigation which should have been squashed before it began, the taxpayer will soon be on the hook for yet more millions of pounds in the compensation which \u2014 quite rightly \u2014 is going to be paid out by the police to the blameless victims of their fatuous witch-hunt.\n\nBut that is by no means the worst thing about this dismal affair.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that not one of the police officers involved in this disgraceful \u2014 and totally avoidable \u2014 cock-up has been formally admonished, let alone punished. Some, like the current head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick have been promoted; one \u2014 Sir Bernard Hogan Howe \u2014 has been elevated to the House of Lords; some, such as Det Supt Kenny \u201cCredible and True\u201d McDonald have retired in the extremely generous pension that is the senior policeman\u2019s lot.\n\nAnd the same goes for all the other individuals and institutions who promoted Carl Beech as a credible witness. These include: Labour MP \u2014 and would-be party leader \u2014 Tom Watson, whose prurient obsession with the case and whose constant needling of the police, was one of the reasons the police pressed so hard with their investigation; the BBC, which featured Beech in silhouette profile as the lead slot on one of its news bulletins, lending false credibility to his claims in the early stages of the investigation; and leftist, self-hating-public-schoolboy blowhard James O\u2019Brien, a Social Justice Warrior shock jock who used his LBC radio show to promote Beech\u2019s claims on several occasions.\n\nAll the problems that led to this hounding of innocents by the authorities, this scandalous waste of public money, this betrayal of the justice system are still in place.\n\nThe system is still very much broken and unless radical action is taken to fix it little is likely to change.\n\nThis is what is perhaps most shocking about the Henriques Report: not so much its description of what happened so much as its explanation of how and why it happened.\n\nEssentially, the police has been emasculated, corrupted, destroyed by political correctness.\n\nHenriques notes, for example, that for some time \u2014 especially with regard to sexual offences \u2014 the police has been operating an \u201calways believe the victim\u201d policy.\n\nAstonishingly, this policy came from the then-Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer, now a prominent Labour MP and a senior player in the left-liberal Establishment.\n\nIn a March 2013 paper titled \u2018The Criminal Justice Response to Child Sexual Abuse: Time for a National Consensus\u2019 Starmer wrote:\n\n\u201cIf the yardstick traditionally used by prosecutors for evaluating the credibility of a victim in other cases were used without adaptation in cases of sexual exploitation, the outcome would potentially be a category of vulnerable victims left unprotected by the criminal law.\u201d\n\nA year later, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary responded with a recommendation that: \u2018The presumption that the victim should always be believed should be institutionalised.\u2019\n\nThe reason I use the word \u2018astonishingly\u2019 with reference to this \u2018always believe the victim\u2019 policy is that it runs roughshod over perhaps the most fundamental of principles in English Common Law: the presumption of innocence. So here we have a left-liberal Director of Public Prosecutions effectively prejudging all sexual abuse trials by designating anyone who goes to the police and claims to have been sexually abused a \u201cvictim\u201d and not simply a \u201ccomplainant.\u201d\n\nHenriques spells out his reservations:\n\n\u201cI have a clear and concluded view. All \u2018complainants\u2019 are not \u2018victims\u2019. Some complaints are false and thus those \u2018complainants\u2019 are not \u2018victims'\u201d\n\nHe goes on:\n\n\u201cSince the investigative process is similarly engaged in ascertaining facts which will, if proven, establish guilt, the use of the word \u2018victim\u2019 at the commencement of an investigation is simply inaccurate and should cease.\u201d\n\nHow difficult can this be \u2013 even for non-lawyers \u2013 to understand?\n\nWe all know that people lie. This is certainly true in lots of alleged rape and sexual abuse cases: some complainants use them as a means of revenge; some, perhaps, to cover up their embarrassment over an infidelity or over regret sex; some because they are mentally disturbed; some because they want to get on the compensation bandwagon.\n\n\u201cAlways believe the victim,\u201d it ought to be obvious to anyone with even half a brain, is an open invitation to the Carl Beeches of this world to go to the police with all manner of elaborate fantasies and \u2014 as in Carl Beech\u2019s case \u2014 to be rewarded with compensation, media attention and attempted prosecutions.\n\nBut here\u2019s where it gets really worrisome. What\u2019s clear from Henriques\u2019s report that the kind of politically correct thinking that led to Starmer\u2019s outrageous directive is institutionalised across the police \u2014 certainly at senior level. Common Purpose \u2014 the insidious social justice organisation that runs PC indoctrination courses for public servants \u2014 has no doubt played a significant part in this. But it would probably have happened anyway because, inevitably once institutions like the police have been co-opted at senior level by Social Justice Warriors, Social Justice Warrior types end up being the only ones who are promoted while more sensible, old school coppers simply retire in disgust rather than serve in a police force they no longer recognise.\n\nHenriques mentions one character called Chief Constable Simon Bailey, author of the Hydrant guidance (for police) on the pursuit of sex cases, who fiercely resisted Henriques criticisms of this system.\n\nHere is Bailey spouting all the PC guff you\u2019d expect a high-ranking police officer to spout, abundant with sociological drivel:\n\n\u2018If we don\u2019t acknowledge a victim as such, it reinforces a system based on distrust and disbelief. The police service is the conduit that links the victim to the rest of the criminal justice system; there is a need to develop a relationship and rapport with a victim (particularly in challenging and complex cases) in order to achieve the best evidence possible. Police officers and police staff investigators through their roles are required to deal with the emotional turmoil often presented by a victim and to determine what is relevant to the complaint that has been made. The term \u201cvictim\u201d features in important legislation, statutory guidance, the policies of the police and Crown Prosecution Service. To remove this and replace it with the word \u2018complainant\u2019 will have a significant detrimental effect on the trust victims now have in the authorities and fundamentally damage the efforts of many organisations re-built over the years\u2019.\n\nLater, Henriques quotes Bailey as claiming \u2013 in defence of his position \u2013 that \u2018only 0.1 per cent of all complaints were false and thus any inaccuracy in the use of the word \u2018victim\u2019 is so minimal that it can be disregarded.\u2019\n\nChief Constable Simon Bailey is currently still head of Norfolk Constabulary. He is the very type of the cod-sociology-drenched, achingly politically correct officer which rises to the top of the police \u2013 largely explaining why the police are currently in such a mess.\n\nReally, it almost beggars belief that the Carl Beech case proceeded as far and expensively as it did, given the nature of his allegations and the utter lack of evidence supporting them.\n\nYet this is what has happened: all that money wasted; all those innocent lives ruined by the very institution \u2013 the police \u2013 which perhaps more than any other has a moral duty to be fair, thorough and to act in the public interest.\n\nNone of which the police currently does.\n\nHenriques cites, for example, the dozens of false prosecutions for rape brought against perfectly innocent men by a Crown Prosecution Service determined \u2014 for politically correct reasons \u2014 to be seen to be taking women\u2019s claims more seriously. The police, we know, helpfully responded to this pressure in some cases by deliberately withholding key evidence that would have got the defendants immediately off the hook.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t \u2014 though of course he could have done, had he had space \u2014 cite the police\u2019s lamentable failure over a period of several decades to stop the mass rape of thousands of white and Sikh, often underage girls by organised Muslim rape gangs. One reason for this, we know from subsequent inquiries, is that the police were more concerned about not appearing \u2018racist\u2019 or \u2018Islamophobic\u2019 than they were about stopping little girls from being groomed, drugged, raped, and sometimes killed by much older men.\n\nThe problem with the Carl Beech affair isn\u2019t that it\u2019s a rare aberration but that it\u2019s absolutely emblematic of the way the British police now operates. The police has been infected by the same identity politics driven PC espoused on the radio by James O\u2019Brien, in Parliament by Tom Watson (indeed by the entirety of the Labour opposition and quite a few Tories too), in the judiciary by that monstrously biased creation of Tony Blair\u2019s, the Supreme Court, in academe by virtually every university professor you could name.\n\nAnd so far, despite the efforts of lonely truth-tellers like Sir Richard Henriques, absolutely nothing has been done to stop it.\n\nBritain\u2019s police \u2013 like so many institutions colonised by the parasite wasps of political correctness \u2013 is a national embarrassment.\n\nA bit of light tinkering is simply not enough: it needs root and branch reform; it needs heads to roll; it needs the system to be changed and its priorities realigned with those of the public it is supposed to serve.\n\nAre you listening Home Secretary Priti Patel?
