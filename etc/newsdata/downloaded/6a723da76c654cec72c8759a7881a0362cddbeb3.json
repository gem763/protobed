Variety first reported the news on Tuesday night.\n\nAs the allegations were laid out by Lauer\u2019s former colleagues on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Wednesday morning, the disgraced anchor responded to the accusations in a 1,300-word open letter sent to Variety. He called Nevils\u2019s description of their sexual encounter \u201ccategorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\u201d and dismissed it as \u201cpart of a promotional effort to sell a book.\u201d\n\nRead more: \u2018Today\u2019 show hosts share \u2018shocking\u2019 and \u2018appalling\u2019 Matt Lauer rape allegations\n\nHe described his sexual relationship with Nevils as \u201cconsensual,\u201d and that there was \u201cabsolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter,\u201d and \u201cshe certainly did not cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations,\u201d Lauer concluded. \u201cAnd I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d\n\nNevils countered in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday night that, \u201cHis open letter was a case study in victim blaming. I am not afraid of him now regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would and now has tried to use against me.\u201d\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades. And there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence.\u2019 Brooke Nevils\n\nNevils also thanked her supporters on Twitter on Wednesday. \u201cI want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt takes courage, and I am truly grateful.\u201d\n\nPeople magazine also reached out to Lauer\u2019s ex wife Annette Roque. (She split with her husband after the sexual misconduct allegations came to light in 2017, and People reports that their divorce was finalized in September.) Roque\u2019s lawyer responded, \u201cnow that the parties are officially divorced, her priority and only concern is for their wonderful children. Our client will make no further statements.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to respond after someone close to you is accused of sexual assault", "description": "Accuser Brooke Nevils and Lauer have both responded to the allegations detailed in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT060_MattLa_ZG_20191010103544.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
