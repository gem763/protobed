We can stand on our own two feet.\u201d However, pushed three times during his interview on the Andrew Marr Show, he failed to rule out a specific deal being struck. Farage has said he is prepared not to stand candidates in Tory areas where he could end up splitting leave voters and warned the Tories they will not win an election without his support.\n\nThe Tories currently have no majority in the Commons and there are concerns they may struggle to win a snap election despite polling showing large lead over Labour.\n\nPressed by Marr, Javid replied: \u201cThe picture our opponents are painting of us \u2026 and of course they would paint a false picture \u2026 we are a proud centre-right, moderate, one nation party.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing extremist about wanting to meet the will of the British people on a simple question, which was, do you want to leave the EU or not?\u201d\n\nMarr said: \u201cI\u2019m asking you one question, can you rule out an agreement with the Brexit party, yes or no?\u201d\n\nJavid said: \u201cWe\u2019re not in an election yet. When we get there I\u2019m clear we don\u2019t need an alliance with anyone. I think our message will resonate across the country.\u201d\n\nFarage\u2019s offer to help the Tories by standing aside in key leave seats is dependent on his party being allowed a clear shot in Labour heartlands. He believes this deal could enable the government to return a majority of over 100.\n\nJavid said an election was now necessary because parliament was trying to \u201cknee-cap\u201d the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations. He denied it now offered nothing for the 48% of voters who voted remain in 2016.\n\nHe said the public like \u201call the other things\u201d they have been talking about like \u201ckeeping the economy strong\u201d.\n\nWith a general election looming, both parties have been scrambling to show they have something to offer both leavers and remainers.\n\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, found herself mocked last week after setting out Labour\u2019s current stance, which is to negotiate a fresh Brexit deal with the EU27 before putting that to the public in a referendum. She and several other senior figures, including Keir Starmer, have said they would then campaign for remain in that vote.\n\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, appeared to signal a shift from that approach on Sunday, suggesting the leave option put to voters could essentially be the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of just confirming what the offer would be and then we\u2019ve said then it has to go back to the people again,\u201d McDonnell said.\n\nHe said that could incorporate some of the reassurances that were under discussions during the cross-party talks initiated by May \u2013 on environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, for example.\n\n\u201cI was in negotiations for six weeks with the Conservatives and there were a whole range of issues there that were addressed which, from the indications that we were getting from the European Union, there might be able to have some shift on.\n\n\u201cSo you can have an offer consolidating that. That would then go back to the people,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwe believe the people should have the final decision.\u201d\n\nLabour is keen to hold open the prospect of winning votes from Brexit supporters in heartland seats \u2013 but also faces intense pressure from its members and many of its MPs to become a full-throated remain party.", "description": "Chancellor evades question over possible election agreement with Brexit party", "authors": ["Kate Proctor", "Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9099eb4a8222207c385ce6654697d68de9f0b050/0_250_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a4c201211f596d71645aaf475014fec6", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
