But there are some murkier areas you may wonder about: What happens if I marry someone whose credit is a lot worse than mine? Could my library fine from five years ago keep me from getting approved for a car loan? Does getting turned down for credit hurt my score?\n\nWe asked experts at the two biggest credit scoring companies to share what consumers mistakenly think can hurt their credit scores. Here\u2019s what Tommy Lee, principal scientist at FICO, FICO, +3.08% and Jeff Richardson, head of marketing and communications at VantageScore, had to say about:\n\n1. Checking your own credit\n\nLee and Richardson say people worry that checking their own credit score will lower it. It won\u2019t.\n\nIf someone checks your credit because you applied for a loan or credit card, it\u2019s called a \u201chard inquiry.\u201d Those can shave a few points off your score, but the impact disappears after six months. When you check your own credit, that\u2019s a \u201csoft inquiry,\u201d which doesn\u2019t hurt your score. You\u2019ll see both types listed on your credit reports.\n\nSome research suggests a link between monitoring your score and improving it, so feel free to check. It\u2019s good credit hygiene.\n\n2. Getting married\n\nYou may share pots and pans, but you don\u2019t share credit. \u201cEach of you has your own distinct credit report, with only those credit obligations you were signed up for included in that report,\u201d Lee says. For better or worse, credit records remain separate when you marry. Your marital status and your spouse\u2019s credit standing don\u2019t affect your credit score.\n\nRead: Your partner\u2019s credit score reveals red flags that have nothing to do with money\n\n3. Bouncing a check\n\nFees for overdrawing your account are bad enough. You don\u2019t have to worry about a bounced check damaging your credit score as well. That\u2019s because bank account information isn\u2019t in your credit report. Your credit score is calculated from the information in your credit reports. If something isn\u2019t in your credit reports, it can\u2019t affect your score.\n\n4. Library or traffic fines\n\nIt used to be that if these fines were turned over to a collections agency, the agency could report it to the credit bureaus, Equifax, EFX, +1.15% Experian EXPGY, +2.90% and TransUnion. TRU, +1.92% A collection action hurts credit scores, and many people learned of forgotten fines via a large drop in their credit scores. As part of a 2015 agreement between the three credit bureaus and the New York attorney general, credit reports no longer include debts that didn\u2019t come from a contract or an agreement to pay. That means jaywalking or a long-forgotten library book won\u2019t hurt your credit.\n\n5. Paying a utility bill late\n\nPaying a credit card bill 30 days past the due date will likely put a big bruise on your credit because most card issuers report to the credit bureaus. Utility payments, however, aren\u2019t routinely reported. A late payment could leave you without service but credit trouble isn\u2019t likely if you eventually pay.\n\n\u201cIf you do not pay for a lengthy period of time, those accounts go to a third-party collection agency who do report it to the credit bureaus,\u201d Richardson says.\n\n6. Being denied credit\n\nYour credit score might dip a bit, but only because your credit was checked when you applied, and that happens whether your application is approved or denied. A hard credit pull \u2014 the kind that happens when you apply for credit \u2014 can shave a few points off your score, but a credit denial won\u2019t be on your credit report and won\u2019t affect it.\n\nAlso see: This couple fought $25,000 in fraudulent credit-card charges after falling prey to identity theft \u2014 then things got worse\n\n7. Paying your credit card bill in full\n\nThere\u2019s a persistent myth that carrying a small balance on your credit card is better for your credit than paying your full balance every month.\n\nThe portion of your credit limit that you use \u2014 called \u201ccredit utilization\u201d \u2014 does affect your credit score. But there is no benefit in paying less than 100% of your statement balance \u2014 and paying the bill in full is best for your credit.\n\n8. Losing your job\n\nLosing an income source can certainly make it tougher to pay your bills, but your income doesn\u2019t directly affect your score.\n\nIt can, however, make it harder to obtain new credit, Lee says. \u201cLenders may look at many factors not found in your credit report when making a credit decision, such as your income, how long you have worked at your present job and the kind of credit you are requesting.\u201d\n\nEven more important than knowing what won\u2019t harm your credit is knowing what will help you build credit:\n\nPay all bills on time; payment history has the biggest effect on credit scores.\n\nUse no more than 30% of your credit limits; credit utilization has the second-biggest impact.\n\nMonitor your credit reports and dispute any score-lowering errors.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Experts put your fears to rest on the things consumers mistakenly think can hurt their credit scores.", "authors": ["Bev O Shea"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR148_nerd_c_ZG_20190911171238.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
