Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the third Democratic debate, touting Obamacare as an alternative to the sweeping Medicare for All plans the senators have been calling for.\n\nBiden lauded Obamacare as a success at expanding healthcare coverage for millions and blasted Medicare for All, a proposal that would make the federal government the main health insurer for Americans and essentially abolish private insurance.\n\nRead more: Elizabeth Warren says she's got a detailed plan for almost everything, but she still lacks specifics on Medicare for All\n\nThen Biden took aim at Warren, who's become one of the race's frontrunners. \"I know that [Senator Warren] says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack. I think it worked,\" Biden said.\n\nLater, Sanders targeted Biden for defending \"the status quo.\"\n\n\"We need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies,\" Sanders said.\n\nBoth duked it out in the early part of the debate, particularly over the price tag of Medicare for All. Estimates of the plan's cost range from $28 to $32 trillion over the first ten of years of its implementation.\n\nBiden said of Sanders: \"For a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate america than I do.\"\n\nStill, Sanders stood his ground.\n\n\"Moving for Medicare for All is the way to go,\" Sanders said.\n\nBusiness Insider is interested in hearing from voters who are following the 2020 Republican primary about questions they have for candidates.
