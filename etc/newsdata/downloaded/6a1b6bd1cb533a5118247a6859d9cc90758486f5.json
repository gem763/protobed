Who benefits?\" It asked people to make a choice. However, it had a little impact on the ground, as people continued the shutdown \"as an act of defiance\".\n\n190828104840102\n\nThe authorities on Monday restored the postpaid mobile phone services which nearly 1.8 million people have access to in the region of nearly 7 million people.\n\nBut the internet blackout and ban on prepaid phones continues to be in place keeping people cut off from the outside world for more than 70 days now.\n\nWhile Shabir says he's been able to earn $100 since August 5, the mobile store adjacent to his shop run by Jalees Ahmad, 45, had no sales at all amid the unprecedented phone restrictions.\n\nThe authorities arrested thousands of separatist leaders, protesters and pro-Indian Kashmiri politicians in the wake of the August 5 decision and brought thousands of additional troops to one of the most militarised zones in the world.\n\nTens of thousands of people have died as India deployed nearly half a million troops to quell an armed rebellion that erupted in late 1980s. Fatalities had sharply dropped in 2000s but since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government came to power more than five years ago, the region has seen an uptick in violence.\n\nThe abrogation of Article 370 was one of the main poll planks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose BJP is opposed autonomy given to Kashmir as part of its \"one nation, one constitution\" vision.\n\nRights groups say hundreds of those arrested, including minors and patients with terminal illness, have been booked under the Public safety Act (PSA), a controversial law under which a person can be detained up to two years without a bail.\n\nWhile most of the shopkeepers are distressed due to the losses but many are equally resolved to carry on their \"protest\".\n\n\"Our protest is part of our freedom struggle which we are fighting since 30 years, where thousands of people have been killed and blinded,\" says Jalees sitting at his shop waiting for customer.\n\nLike Shabir, Jalees too has to pay the shop rent. He has to carry the education of his children and support his family which would cost him his entire monthly salary of around $300. But they are ready to \"suffer the losses\".\n\n\"This is the Muslim-majority land but we fear this all will change,\" said another shopkeeper who wished to remain anonymous.\n\n\"If police sees us talking to journalists, they might come to pick us up in the evening. There is only fear among people who have been crushed from all sides,\" he said.\n\n'Threats by militants'\n\nThe region's police chief, Dilbagh Singh, told Al Jazeera that armed rebels were targeting people who were trying to resume their normal work.\n\nHe said that the latest target was a 45-year-old non-local truck driver from the state of Rajashthan who was shot dead in south Kashmir's Shopian district on Monday evening when he was loading apples in his truck.\n\n\n\n\"There were militants and their over ground workers who were spreading posters and threatening shopkeepers and farmers,\" the official said adding that they have launched crackdown on the network of overground workers of armed groups and arrested 20 people.\n\nThe police official said that the incidents of threats have particularly surfaced in southern Kashmir districts where rebels are active.\n\n'UN has failed all'\n\nIndian Prime Minister Modi sold the move as a way to bring development to the region but since the lockdown was placed in August, the apple industry - the lifeblood of the economy involving nearly half of the state's population - has suffered.\n\nTourism and handicraft sectors have also been hit hard as tourist inflow almost stopped amid precarious security situation.\n\nAbdul Ahad, who works as tourist driver alleged that the government is \"bringing workers of the BJP\" to Kashmir and \"presenting them as tourists\".\n\n\"They are busy in showing tourism is returning back [to normalcy] through their propaganda media. Their democracy in Kashmir is based on lies. They lie every day,\" he said while puffing a cigarette.\n\nLike the shopkeepers, school and college students in the region too have stayed away from their classes. The annual board exams are nearing but the students have not completed their syllabus.\n\n190919153536231\n\n\"Our parents groom us for 10-15 years. We study, work hard, secure distinctions but one day we are hit with a bullet suddenly. What is our future? Why should we worry about schools when we are not sure about our future,\" said Bisma Shafi, a 25-year-old college student.\n\n\"What does education mean in such situation, when our lives are at an edge, when kids are jailed and tortured?\" asked Shafi.\n\nAfter August 19, when the curfew was lifted in Kashmir, the government announced the opening of educational institutions but the students have stayed away as parents fear for the safety of their children.\n\nA college professor in the main city of Srinagar told Al Jazeera that they were being asked by authorities to \"motivate students to attend classes in uniforms\".\n\n\"They want us to give students projects, force them to come for exams but we don't want to do that because it is not a normal situation,\" the college professor told Al Jazeera on the conditions of anonymity.\n\nMany residents also expressed their disappointment with the global human rights organisations and the United Nations (UN).\n\n\"What is United Nations doing? asked Sameed Ahmad, 31, who works in the Middle East and has come to Kashmir to attend his sister's wedding.\n\n\"It [the UN] has not done anything for the oppressed people of the world. It has failed [us] all,\" he said.", "description": "Over 70 days since India revoked Kashmir's autonomy shops remain shut and schools are empty as part of 'silent protest'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/7bb4691521d84db8b2e6257525ae3c7c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
