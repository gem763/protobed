REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo\n\n\u201cA dual listing is a likely scenario. Singapore definitely will be one venue,\u201d Lim told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference organized by DealStreetAsia on Tuesday.\n\nARA Group and its associates have grown their assets under management to S$83 billion from S$36 billion ($26.2 billion) in 2017 when Lim partnered with Warburg Pincus and China\u2019s AVIC Trust to take ARA private, valuing the company at S$1.8 billion.\n\nBesides Singapore, other listing options include Shanghai, Hong Kong, London and the United States, Lim said.\n\n\u201cOur transformation is done. This is the time for us to grow,\u201d said Lim, adding that he expected the company to have a valuation of between S$4 billion to S$5 billion in 2-3 years.\n\nARA manages 21 public and private real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Asia Pacific and over 70 private funds. This year, ARA U.S. Hospitality Trust (ARAU.SI), comprising 38 U.S. upscale hotels, listed in Singapore and raised $498 million.\n\nARA counts Li Ka-shing-backed CK Asset Holdings (1113.HK) and Straits Trading Company Ltd among its other investors.\n\nLim said ARA planned to expand its assets under management to S$100 billion within two years, supported by growing demand from a wide range of global investors hunting for yields.\n\nSince its delisting, ARA has acquired stakes in Japanese and Australian real estate investment managers, set up real estate investment platforms in Europe, U.s. and launched a Southeast Asia infrastructure fund.\n\n\u201cWe should have our first close of the infrastructure fund in the first quarter of next year,\u201d said Lim.\n\nThe $1 billion fund will target investments in utilities, airports, seaports and roads. \u201cThis is where the region needs to transform and there\u2019s a big market for this,\u201d he said.\n\nLim said a stock market listing of ARA will provide it a platform to raise money, create liquidity in its shares and offer investors an option to trim down their holdings.\n\nSingapore has become one of the world\u2019s biggest hubs to list REITS and business trusts, boosted by a supportive regulatory environment and growing demand from investors looking for stable yields.", "description": "Warburg Pincus-backed ARA Asset Management Ltd, one of the largest Asian real estate fund managers, is exploring a dual stock market listing, including one in Singapore, in the next two to three years, group CEO and co-founder John Lim said.", "authors": ["Anshuman Daga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430796742&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0PK", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
