Mastercard and Visa have already left the group.\n\nFears surrounding Libra \u2014 which was launched in June in partnership with the likes of ride-hailing app Uber and music streaming service Spotify \u2014 stem from the prospect of Facebook allowing its 2.4 billion users to pay with a digital currency that could supplant established currencies. That would undermine governments\u2019 control over national finances.\n\nThe U.S. administration is concerned that the anonymous nature of a cryptocurrency could help terrorism financiers and money launderers.\n\nThe Paris-led coalition is encouraging EU governments to consider banning Libra altogether, according to eurozone diplomats and European Commission officials who spoke to POLITICO.\n\nAn outright EU ban seems problematic in the eyes of the Commission, the officials said. Brussels would need a legal reason to prohibit the payment service and still needs more information to know what rules would apply to Libra.\n\nInstead, diplomats are preparing a statement to come from finance ministers in December that the Facebook-backed Libra Association shouldn't be allowed to introduce the instrument unless the EU can regulate it.\n\nWhen asked to comment, a spokeswoman for France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, referred to his comments in Washington on October 18 when he met with his peers from the G7 economic powers.\n\n\u201cCountries would lose their sovereignty to private interests and lose control over their monetary policies, which is something that would be totally unacceptable,\u201d Le Maire told reporters at the time. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept that.\u201d\n\nLibra has also spooked policymakers stateside. The U.S. administration is concerned that the anonymous nature of a cryptocurrency could help terrorism financiers and money launderers move their cash out of view of authorities.\n\nEliminating risk\n\nParis, Berlin and Rome already floated the idea of banning Libra back at the G7 gathering, after the finance ministers discussed the risks associated with so-called stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies like Libra, backed by conventional money to stabilize their value.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, however, was reluctant to start issuing policy recommendations for stablecoins. He preferred to merely highlight the risks associated with initiative, officials briefed on the G7 meeting said.\n\nCommission officials are also urging caution against the current French push, concerned it could paint the EU as a hostile place for tech companies to launch new products and services.\n\nFrance\u2019s allies are less patient.\n\n\u201cWe defend that it is necessary to analyze and eliminate all possible associated risks, as well as to create an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework before allowing any such project to be launched,\u201d a Spanish finance ministry official said.\n\nA representative for Libra said the association\u2019s \u201cpriority is to partner with regulators to ensure all their questions and concerns are rightfully addressed.\u201d\n\nA joint declaration on Libra \u201cwith other eurozone member states\u201d is in the works, the Spanish official continued. EU finance ministers are scheduled to briefly discuss plans for the December statement at their next Ecofin Council on November 8.\n\nA German government official, asked for comment, pointed to Fi\u00adnance Min\u00adis\u00adter Olaf Scholz's comments to WirtschaftsWoche magazine this month. He said he took a \"very, very critical\" view of Libra, and opposed private currencies competing with official money.\n\nA representative for Libra said the association\u2019s \u201cpriority is to partner with regulators to ensure all their questions and concerns are rightfully addressed.\u201d\n\nThe Geneva-based Libra Association, which is in charge of preparing the currency launch, recently replied to 32 questions from the Commission\u2019s financial services department.\n\nCommission teams studying the answers have learned little new from the responses, according to officials who said it's still not clear how Libra will operate as a business.\n\n\u201cOur short-term priority is to continue our legal assessment of the cryptocurrency,\u201d a Commission spokesperson said. \u201cAt this stage, it is too early to say how the project can be launched in the EU.\u201d\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
