(Image: Marvel Comics)\n\nStar Wars loves \u2014 loves \u2014 itself a single-trait environment. Whether that\u2019s planetary biomes or species, if you\u2019re a thing in Star Wars, you\u2019re likely defined by a singular concept. This week\u2019s new Rise of Skywalker prequel comic combines that love with another frustrating franchise love \u2014 cyclical storytelling \u2014 to pretty bummer effect.\n\nThis week saw the release of the second issue of Star Wars: Allegiance \u2014 by Ethan Sacks, Luke Ross, Lee Loughridge, and Clayton Cowles. It\u2019s a new Marvel Star Wars comic that\u2019s part of the wider Lucasfilm publishing initiative dubbed \u201cThe Road to The Rise of Skywalker,\u201d a series of media tie-ins that tell key stories setting up the path from the end of The Last Jedi into the ninth and final entry of the Skywalker Saga.\n\nWhen The Last Jedi left the Resistance all but broken by the relentless First Order invasion of the galaxy, Allegiance and stories like it have seen what\u2019s left of the rebellious group reach out to old allies of both the Resistance itself and the organisation that inspired it, the Rebel Alliance, in an attempt to reunite the galaxy against a renewed tyrannical threat. Allegiance has seen Leia \u2014 with a little help from Chewie, Rose, and Rey \u2014 head to Mon Cala, the aquatic abode of the Quarren (the aforementioned squid people) and the Mon Calamari, hoping that once again she can convince a tired people, all too familiar with the costs she asks of them, to take up arms alongside her as they have done before.\n\nNossor\u2019s delegation gives a frosty welcome to the Millennium Falcon. (Image: Luke Ross, Lee Loughridge, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nThings do not go well \u2014 as they didn\u2019t before. From the minute Leia and her friends land in Dac City, they\u2019re treated with suspicion by the Mon Calamari, but especially so by the Quarren representative (General Nossor) that plays a part in the planet\u2019s dual-species governing body. Even initially presenting her arrival as a way to honour the death of Admiral Ackbar with his son, Aftab, Leia, her allies and the Resistance are made to be felt distinctly unwelcome.\n\nWhen she petitions the Mon Calamari king, Ech-Char, things become clearer: the Mon Cala are tired. They\u2019ve fought in wars for decades at this point, multiple wars at the behest of Leia Organa. She asks a lot to trust that they\u2019d do so again, to the consistent heavy cost to Mon Calamari and the Quarren alike \u2014 more than just leaders like Admiral Raddus and Admiral Ackbar, but their ships, literally built out of their cities, their peoples to staff them, and the spirits those people hold. Because, as we\u2019ve said before, all of this has happened before.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the only thing familiar to this story. Leia faces an uphill battle to convince Mon Cala to enter the fight again, but what she doesn\u2019t yet realise is that she\u2019s entered a trap (if only someone were still around to warn her!). The climax of the issue reveals that General Nossor is making plans to make the Resistance look even more unwelcomed on Mon Cala, sending his goons to goad Rey, Rose, and Chewbacca into a public brawl. Because it turns out that Nossor is up to no good...\n\nNossor? Betraying people to work with villains? Well I never. (Image: Luke Ross, Lee Loughridge, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\n...and is working with the First Order to rat out the Resistance. Surprise!\n\nExcept, it isn\u2019t. Because Nossor\u2019s predecessor-in-government did the exact same thing to Leia, Han, Luke, Chewie, and Ackbar when this exact same story played out in the pages of Kieron Gillen, Salvador Larroca, Guru-eFX and Clayton Cowles\u2019s run on the main Star Wars series. At least that time, it was a Mon Calamari, the Regent Urtaya \u2014 and the Quarren and Mon Calamari themselves were simply following along in being Imperial subordinates after the planet\u2019s first attempt at rebellion had been cruelly crushed by Darth Vader in his own comic series, set years prior.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also not the first time the Quarren specifically have been turncoats to the good guys. Beyond that, when this same story was told in the Clone Wars animated series, the Quarren secretly worked with the Separatists against the Mon Calamari King Lee-Char (backed by the Republic) in an attempt to gain Quarren rule over the planet at large. Hell, the betrayer in question? Chieftan Nossor Ri. Literally the same Quarren, doing the same plot!\n\nNossor in younger, still turncoat-ier times. (Image: Lucasfilm)\n\nIt means that, essentially, over the course of roughly 50-60 years in the Star Wars timeline, the Quarren have either actively committed subterfuge or indirectly played along with the forces Star Wars presents as \u201cthe bad guys\u201d \u2014 be they a coalition of secessionists, an actual fascist Empire, or the hateful descendants of that Empire \u2014 three different times.\n\nAnd, because it\u2019s Star Wars and you can\u2019t swing a glowing laser sword around without severing the limb of at least one Skywalker, they\u2019ve done so by attempting to betray a member of the galaxy\u2019s most prominent bloodline each time too, whether it was Anakin in the Clone Wars, Luke and Leia in the Galactic Civil War, or now Leia again in this Age of Resistance.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Star Wars\u2019 penchant for telling the same story in different generations and time periods, a trait that has made its universe feel smaller and smaller every time it happens. The fact that it uses the same tools to do so \u2014 in the case of Clone Wars and Allegiance, the same character! \u2014 also essentially makes it feel like the Quarren\u2019s defining trait has evolved beyond just being the Squid People from the Water planet of the Fish People. Now, they\u2019re the fascist sympathising Squid People from the Water planet of the Fish People.\n\nYou know, like how all Bothans are spies because a bunch of said spies got killed delivering the plans to the second Death Star, or how all Toydarians are weirdly uncomfortable anti-Semitic stereotypes (because Watto), or how all Trandoshans are arsehole mercenaries (because Bossk).\n\nInversely, it\u2019s why we get the Mon Calamari as noble tacticians like Lee-Char, Raddus, Ackbar and potentially Aftab himself. Or Wookiees all being incredibly dedicated warriors, because that\u2019s what Chewbacca is.\n\nAnd even though over the years Star Wars has used both of those tropes to a positive benefit, here, it just kinda sucks? It\u2019s this heady mix of Star Wars telling the same exact tale over and over and the way the franchise typically stereotypes its alien species to create an effect that is both hilarious and yet also oddly dark. Why trust a Quarren whenever they show up in a Star Wars story?\n\nNinety per cent of the time they will be aggressive when faced with change, and with outside influences \u2014 and, in the process of acting on that aggression, turn toward the nearest legion of space secessionists they can find to sell you out.\n\nOh look, the Quarren are violent thugs again. (Image: Luke Ross, Lee Loughridge, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be more interesting at this point to inverse the relationship, and have a dismayed sect of Quarren turn to Leia and reveal that, after two long bloody wars, it\u2019s the Mon Calamari who\u2019ve been broken enough to turn to the First Order? Wouldn\u2019t be more interesting for there to be any inkling of a diverse ideology instead of what appears to be generation after generation of Quarren leaders willing to sell their people and planet out to the nearest strongman? Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if we were not telling this exact same story for the third time?\n\nI guess, at this point, it\u2019s become enough of a Star Wars trait that some might feel that doing such a thing would just simply be un-Star Wars. And we only have to look at the... let\u2019s say varied reaction to Luke Skywalker\u2019s crisis of faith in The Last Jedi to see how fans reacting to things they have deemed \u201cun-Star Wars\u201d can turn out these days.\n\nWho knows \u2014 there are still two issues of Allegiance left to wrap up this prelude series, so there\u2019s space for twists and turns. Maybe this time Nossor won\u2019t return to the side of the heroes after his betrayal. Maybe, given the First Order\u2019s penchant for betraying even its sympathizers, he won\u2019t live long enough to do so.\n\nBut right now it just all feels so tired, for a franchise that can, and needs, to do better.\n\nEspecially as we get ever closer to a reality where The Rise of Skywalker arrives, actually does what it promises to do and ends this story, and \u2014 at least for a little while \u2014 Star Wars cannot rely on the same familiar nostalgia to grow.\n\nIf not for our sake, but the Quarren. They deserve a break from being spineless stooges for a bit.", "description": "Star Wars loves \u2014 loves \u2014 itself a single-trait environment.
