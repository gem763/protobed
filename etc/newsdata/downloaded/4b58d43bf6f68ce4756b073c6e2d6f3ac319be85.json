The new battle royale game seems to be an instant hit as it has already crossed 100 million downloads, according to a report by app research firm SensorTower.\n\nThe report notes the game beat first-week download numbers achieved by other popular games such as PlayersUnknown BattleGround (PUBG) and Fortnite. While PUBG picked up 28 million downloads within the first week of launch, Fortnite had 22 million downloads.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note PUBG was released in limited regions, and Fortnite was iOS-only at the beginning. On the flip side, Call of Duty Mobile launched on both platforms and in all countries except mainland China, Vietnam, and Belgium.\n\nThe report also says iOS leads the download tally with 56.9 million as compared to 45.3 million on Android. The United States leads the country-wide download chart with 17.3 million, followed by India with 13.7 million, and Brazil with 7.1 million.\n\nWhile these are early days for the game, it\u2019s an impressive start nonetheless. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if PUBG and Fortnite fans will move over to the new title just to get some fresh battle royale experience.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fcall_of_duty_mobile_how_to_use_ps4_and_xbox_one_controller_on_ip_1350095.jpg&signature=b0dc6dd53184d748f02334adf4cb0c0d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
