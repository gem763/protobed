For 9 days, she made tearful pleas for their safe return.\n\nBut it was all a lie.\n\nAs her story began to unravel, Smith admitted that there was no carjacker, and that she had let her car roll into a lake with Michael, 3, and Alex, 14 months, still strapped in their car seats.\n\nHer motive: She was secretly dating a man who didn\u2019t want children. The story became international news, even landing on the cover of PEOPLE. Smith was convicted of two counts of murder and is serving a life sentence in Leath Correctional Institution in Greenwood, S.C.\n\nNow, 25 years later, Smith, now 48, has spent more than half of her life in prison \u2014 and records obtained by PEOPLE show that her incarceration has been marred with disciplinary infractions for self-mutilation and drug use.\n\nLast March, she was promoted to be a Wardkeeper Assistant, in which she is responsible for the daily operation of her housing unit. In 2017, she was working in the prison as a landscape laborer \u2014 a step down from a position she previously had, as a senior groundskeeper.\n\nAt least six times in the past two years, Smith has had severe enough medical issues that she has been transferred to another facility for outpatient treatment. The nature of her treatment has not been made public.\n\nIn the past nine years, Smith has been disciplined at least five times for various infractions, including self-mutilation and the use and possession of narcotics or marijuana. Each infraction has resulted in the loss of privileges, including loss of visitation, canteen and telephone privileges.\n\nTwice in 2010 and once in 2015, she was disciplined on drug charges, losing privileges for more than a year.\n\nSusan Smith in August, 2017 | South Carolina Department of Corrections More\n\nIn 2000, Smith, then 28, was disciplined for having sex four times with 50-year-old prison guard Houston Cagle. (He pleaded guilty and spent 3 months in jail.)\n\nThe following year, a prison captain, Alfred Rowe, also pleaded guilty to having sex with Smith and was sentenced to five years probation.\n\nBut Smith claims she has been misunderstood.\n\nIn 2015, Smith wrote a letter defending herself to The State, a South Carolina newspaper. \u201cMr. Cahill, I am not the monster society thinks I am,\u201d she wrote to reporter Harrison Cahill. \u201cI am far from it.\u201d", "description": "Inside Susan Smith's Life in Prison 25 Years After Drowning Kids", "authors": ["Steve Helling"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vn8padAc9hlSk_HP40nhfA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/tardis/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeopledotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Fsusan-smith-1.jpg&h=1000&f=jpg&q=80", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
