REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\n\nThe parade in the capital Sarajevo ended peacefully despite fears of violence prompted by aggressive hate speech online in a country where anti-gay sentiment can often be heard in public.\n\n\u201cI have always thought that basic human rights should exist for all and when I saw all those hate comments against the Pride march, I felt it was my obligation to come and show support,\u201d said Sanja, 54, from Sarajevo, who joined the march with her husband.\n\nMore than 1,000 police officers secured the event, shielding the walking area with fences and concrete blocks. Anti-sniper units were placed on the roofs of buildings along the main route in the city center.\n\nBosnia is the last Balkan country to hold a Pride parade, seen as a test of tolerance of minority rights as it seeks to join the European Union. EU diplomats and the U.S Ambassador to Bosnia, who is gay, joined the march in support of LGBT people.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in the protection of the fundamental rights of all citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including of LGBTI persons, who have the right to live their lives free from discrimination, abuse and threats...,\u201d Johannes Hahn, the EU enlargement commissioner, said in a tweet.\n\nBIG STEP FORWARD\n\nOrganizers from across the ethnic divide - in a country that went through a devastating war in the 1990s - carried a pink banner with the slogan \u2018Ima Izac\u2019 or \u2018I Want Out\u2019 in both Latin and Cyrillic scripts.\n\nActivists carried placards reading \u201cLove is not a Privilege\u201d and \u201cQueer Resistance\u201d, waving rainbow flags and singing anti-fascist songs.\n\n\u201cWe, LGBTIQ persons, fight every day for our existence, identity and love,\u201d said Branko Culibrk, an organizer, adding that passivity of institutions in Bosnia, where discrimination against minority groups is legally banned, had encouraged violence from homophobic groups.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, several hundred opponents of the Pride march held a peaceful meeting and a walk, carrying placards condemning homosexuality. On Saturday, several conservative groups organized another march devoted to \u201ctraditional family values\u201d.\n\nHomophobia and discrimination, often fueled by religious leaders and right-wing political parties, is widespread in the Balkans.\n\nAll religious communities in Bosnia condemned the Pride parade but advised followers against resorting to violence.\n\nMany famous Bosnian artists also attended the parade, including music star Bozo Vreco, known for wearing dresses and acknowledging his desire to express both the male and female sides of his personality.\n\n\u201cThis is a big step forward for Bosnia and Sarajevo, opening the doors toward Europe and the world,\u201d Vreco told Reuters. \u201cI am so proud and happy, I think that love has won today.\u201d", "description": "Several thousand people marched in Bosnia's first Gay Pride on Sunday, protected by a major security operation including anti-sniper units after some conservative Muslim groups organized counter-rallies.", "authors": ["Daria Sito-Sucic", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427660436&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870PC", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
