The amount of people watching every game and supporting us in Japan has been amazing.\u201d\n\nLong queues for replica shirts and endless repeats of Japan\u2019s wins on TV are testament to the growing excitement around the team.\n\nHowever, they remain heavy underdogs against an imposing South Africa side, who have set out to bully the Japanese with their massive pack and by naming six forwards among their eight replacements on the bench.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Play with pride\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll definitely lose if I go head-on,\u201d conceded scrum-half Yutaka Nagare.\n\n\u201cI have to use my technique given I\u2019m small. The try (Finn) Russell scored in the Scotland game started off with my mistake so I really felt responsible, and I feel they\u2019ll look to attack me in the next game, as well as near the try-line.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve decided to go in determined to play with pride for this team. I\u2019ll keep my mind strong. I\u2019ll take them on carrying both mind and technique.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s ultra-fast, accurate handling and lightning pace created four highlight-reel tries against Scotland as they won 28-21 to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nSouth Africa defence coach Jacques Nienaber said it was a \u201cnice challenge\u201d to work out how to nullify the attacking threat of a side crafted by former All Black Joseph.\n\n\u201cThey play a certain style and to their strengths, and they utilise their wings a lot. Their wings won\u2019t typically stay on their sides so the style would incorporate them in attack on both sides -\u2013 they both work off their touchlines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut again it does pose weaknesses as well. If you concede turnovers and both your wingers are on one edge, it means you don\u2019t have pace on the other edge.\n\n\u201cSo, it does have its benefits. But, like in anything in rugby, for any benefit there is also a counter.\u201d\n\nWales, meanwhile, start as favourites against a mercurial French side which has shown flashes of brilliance among periods of mediocrity.\n\nAt the back of their minds will be the stinging defeat eight years ago, when Sam Warburton\u2019s early red card ultimately put paid to their hopes of reaching the final for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe worst memory is the World Cup semi-final in 2011,\u201d said outgoing coach Warren Gatland, when asked about Wales\u2019s games with France.\n\n\u201cThe best memory? I\u2019m just trying to think\u2026 this Sunday?\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Millions of home fans will tune in on Sunday as host team Japan bid to extend their Rugby World Cup fairy-tale in a historic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/ee516c_japan-rugby-players-captured-nation-imagination-fairy-tale-run-world-cup-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
