REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nVoters can cast a ballot from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. through Monday, which is Canada\u2019s Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals would win 35.4% if the election were held today, and Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives would bring in 33.2% nationally, a Nanos Research poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail said on Friday.\n\nBut the left-leaning New Democrats (NDP) and Quebec\u2019s separatist Bloc Quebecois may be left with the balance of power as the polls suggest neither of the main parties is heading for an outright majority in the 338-seat House of Commons.\n\nThe early voting \u201cmeans that for a big chunk of the electorate, this election is already over,\u201d Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said on Twitter. \u201cFeverish advertising, last minute pitches (are) being made to shrinking audience as election gets closer.\u201d\n\nAfter the final debate on Thursday evening, all the candidates went back on the campaign trail on Friday.\n\nTrudeau started his day with a short speech to supporters in Ottawa, where he underscored his government\u2019s record of creating \u201c1 million jobs\u201d over the past four years. At the same time, Canada\u2019s statistics office said the economy had added a stronger-than-expected 53,700 net jobs in September.\n\nScheer is in British Columbia where he will announce the full cost of his campaign platform in the afternoon, almost two weeks after the Liberals presented theirs.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t release your best work at 6 o\u2019clock on a Friday before a long weekend,\u201d Trudeau said at his early morning rally.\n\nTrudeau is ramping up spending while promising to keep debt on a downward path. Scheer, on the other hand, has said he will balance the budget in five years if elected. Trudeau says Scheer\u2019s plan will require painful spending cuts.\n\nMeanwhile, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh presented his full platform on Friday. The costly plan promises a national prescription-drug and dental plan, plus investments in housing, post-secondary education, and the fight against climate change.\n\nThe NDP says it will pay for its plan by raising corporate income taxes, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, cracking down on tax havens, increasing the capital gains tax and by introducing a levy on the super wealthy - those with fortunes exceeding C$20 million ($15.2 million).\n\n\u201cI am firmly opposed to austerity,\u201d Singh said, adding however that he believes in being prudent.", "description": "Canadians began voting on Friday in advance polls ahead of the Oct. 21 federal election as party leaders set out on the final stretch of the campaign with polls showing the two largest parties locked in a dead heat.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439820677&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A202-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
