You might well be the prime minister at the time when that comes about and you can get an even better deal for Britain.\u2019\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

You know, this is a huge decision for our country and I think we\u2019ve taken the wrong path. As I\u2019ve said, it can be made to work.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me, do I have regrets? Yes. Am I sorry about the state the country\u2019s got into? Yes.\n\n\u201cDo I feel I have some responsibility for that? Yes. It was my referendum, my campaign, my decision to try to renegotiate.\n\n\u201cAnd I accept all of those things and people, including those watching this programme, will have to decide how much blame to put on me.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would apologise, Mr Cameron said: \u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry about all that\u2019s happened.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a day that goes by when I don\u2019t think about all the decisions I made and all that has followed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I regret that we lost the campaign. I regret I let expectations about the negotiation run far too high.\n\n\u201cI regret some of the individual decisions we made in the campaign.
