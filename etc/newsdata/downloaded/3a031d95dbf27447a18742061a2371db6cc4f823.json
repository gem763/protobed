This is beyond repugnant.\"\n\nTrump's mention of civil war also drew criticism from Richard Painter, who served as White House chief ethics lawyer under President George W Bush.\n\n\"A president who threatens civil war if the political process does not support him cannot be allowed to command the United States military,\" said Painter, who has left the Republican Party. \"He should be removed from office immediately.\"\n\nTrump has revived various conspiracy theories including one that posits that the hacking of a Democratic Party server and theft of emails during the 2016 presidential election came from Ukraine and not from Russia.\n\n\"It is completely debunked,\" Trump's former Homeland Security adviser Thomas Bossert, told the ABC's \"This Week,\" of the conspiracy theory.\n\nDuring his call with Zelensky, Trump asked Ukraine's leader to look into this along with a probe of Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nBesides Democrats, Trump has stepped up his attacks on one of his favorite targets -- the media.\n\n\"These Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, are doing great harm to our Country,\" Trump tweeted. \"They are lying & cheating like never before in our Country's history in order to destabilize the United States of America & it's upcoming 2020 Election.\n\n\"They & the Fake News Media are Dangerous & Bad!\" he said.\n\nFew Republican lawmakers have been critical of Trump since the Ukraine scandal emerged last week but former Republican senator Jeff Flake of Arizona urged them on Monday to speak up.\n\n\"My fellow Republicans, it is time to risk your careers in favor of your principles,\" Flake said in a column in The Washington Post. \"Whether you believe the president deserves impeachment, you know he does not deserve reelection.\n\n\"For those who want to put America first, it is critically important at this moment in the life of our country that we all, here and now, do just that,\" Flake said. \"Trust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job. But you cannot go elsewhere for a soul.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Conspiracy theories, calls to arrest Democrats for treason, ominous warnings about civil war: President Donald Trump, facing the threat of impeachment, is ramping up his bellicose rhetoric on Twitter to a new level.
