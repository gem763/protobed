Steven John\n\nI've never been what anyone would call a great sleeper. Traditionally, it takes me at least a half hour to nod off even after a tiring day. And I tend to wake up at least once or twice a night, often for stretches of an hour or more. I've tried reducing caffeine intake after lunch, skipping evening cocktails, avoiding screens prior to bedtime, and even meditative exercises, all to little or no avail.\n\nI just don't sleep that well, and that's that. Or so I thought. But before we talk more about my sleep and/or lack thereof, let's talk about my wife. She has no trouble sleeping. Often enough we'll kiss goodnight, settle down on our respective sides of the bed, and then within five minutes, I'll realize she is fast asleep. She can also stay asleep even after I've thrown in the proverbial towel and left the bedroom in the middle of the night.\n\nBut regardless of prior sleep disposition, no one sleeps well during the third trimester of pregnancy. Being as she was in said condition in the opening months of 2018, my wife and I were both enduring more than our share of semi-sleepless nights earlier this year.\n\nThen we got a Casper Wave mattress, and much to my disbelief-turned-delight, we both started sleeping better. We're both still sleeping well despite the fact that our daughter is now on this side of the womb and wakes us multiple times a night demanding sustenance, snuggles, and diaper changes. (I'm also woken many nights by a four-year-old son who needs another tucking in, and occasionally by a cat jumping on my head. Never a dull moment, much to my chagrin.)\n\nOnce you get the mattress out of the box and plop it down on your bed, it expands in a matter of minutes with no unpleasant off-gassing period, either. Steven John\n\nThe first thing you need to know about a Casper mattress is that there's no BS involved, to put it simply.\n\nWhile I'm known to be a master mattress price haggler, I'm actually much happier to simply know the price of something and pay it than to go back and forth with some fast-talking bed hawker. With a Casper mattress, the price varies based on model (they offer The Essential, The Casper, and The Wave) and bed size, and that's it.\n\nOnce you order your Casper mattress, it will be shipped to your door, usually arriving in three or four days. (Get some help carrying the box upstairs, by the way. I didn't, which is why I know it's a good idea for you to do that.)\n\nOnce you get the mattress out of the box and plop it down on your bed, it expands in a matter of minutes with no unpleasant off-gassing period, either. We slept on ours the same night it arrived, and we slept better than we had in weeks to boot.\n\nAnother thing you need to know about the Casper Wave mattress specifically is that this thing is basically a marvel of engineering. It blends brilliant design with superlative materials, the result being quite simply the best mattress I've ever slept on. And I say that despite the fact that, with a preschooler and a newborn in the house, I have not been allowed to sleep through the night in many, many nights.\n\nWhat most impresses me about the Wave mattress is how quickly I find myself comfortably lying still and how minimally I need to move or turn to stay comfortable.\n\nThat's thanks to the soft, cushioning upper foam layer of the mattress, into which your body settles at once without pressure points. But if you were to fall asleep atop a gentle pile of down comforters, you would wake up sore and stiff, your body having settled too deeply into that soft fluff. The foam layers below the soft, welcoming upper layer of the Wave are not only firmer, but are precision-designed to offer the exact level of support needed for each part of the body. Your shoulders and your hips want to settle more deeply into a mattress than your knees, for example, so the mattress accommodates these heavier areas of the body by allowing them to settle more deeply. Seems like a simple concept, but in fact the company's varied support system is patent pending and truly unique.\n\nThe Casper Wave is money oh so very well spent. Trust me, I slept on it before saying that. Steven John\n\nFalling asleep fast is lovely; waking up genuinely refreshed and feeling great is priceless.\n\nThanks to the support the Casper Wave's layered design provides, I'm ache-free in the morning, and thanks to the temperature regulation of the open cell foam, I don't wake up hot or sweating, which was standard operating procedure with our old mattress.\n\nSo while a Casper Wave will set you back a few bucks (twin-sized Casper Waves are $1,250; king-sized Wave mattresses go for $2,750), it's money oh so very well spent. Trust me, I slept on it before saying that.\n\nOf course, if you receive your Casper Wave and decide that this particular foam mattress is not for you, don't fret. There is a 100-day return policy, so if you sleep on it and dislike it, you can always send it back from whence it came.\n\nRight now, readers of this review can use Insider Picks' exclusive promo code \" INSIDER100\" for $100 off a Casper Wave mattress.", "description": "The Casper Wave mattress helped my wife sleep in the ninth month of pregnancy, and is helping us both sleep even with a noisy newborn in a bedside bassinet.", "authors": ["Steven John", "Insider Picks"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5becab2b101142104d4f0742-640-320.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-30"}
