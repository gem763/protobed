At least one Indonesian soldier and four civilians were killed in that violence.\n\nThe previous protests were triggered by videos circulated on the internet showing security forces calling Papuan university students \u201cmonkeys\u201d and \u201cdogs\u201d in East Java\u2019s Surabaya city when they stormed a dormitory where Papuan students were staying after a torn Indonesian flag was found in a sewer.\n\nThe videos prompted hundreds of Papuan students who study in other Indonesian provinces to return home and force a local state university to accommodate them.\n\nDaryanto said a mob of angry students attacked a soldier and several police officers in Jayapura with machetes and rocks, forcing security forces to respond with gunfire, killing three civilians. The soldier died on the way to a hospital. At least five police officers were in critical condition.\n\nConflicts between indigenous Papuans and Indonesian security forces are common in the impoverished Papua region, a former Dutch colony in the western part of New Guinea that is ethnically and culturally distinct from much of Indonesia.\n\nPapua was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a U.N.-sponsored ballot that was widely seen as a sham. Since then, a low-level insurgency has simmered in the mineral-rich region, which is divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua.\n\nIn recent years, some Papua students, including some who study in other provinces, have become vocal in calling for self-determination for their region.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At least 20 people were killed Monday, including three shot by police, in violent protests by hundreds of people sparked by rumors that a teacher insulted an indigenous student in Indonesia's restive Papua province, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Niniek Karmini"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/indonesia_papua_protests_18157_c0-170-2000-1336_s1770x1032.jpg?8d0b6673f70ab6df8c723ad1812f984799b57b6c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
