Trump says the U.S. has sanctioned the Iranian National Bank: \"We have just sanctioned the Iranian National Bank \u2013 that is their central banking system \u2013 and it's going to be at the highest level of sanctions.\" https://t.co/AkUE5Xqu8E pic.twitter.com/OU8G2bQQCF \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 20, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement comes two days after Trump said he had instructed Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin to \u201csubstantially increase\u201d sanctions on Iran following several attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities that the U.S. attributed to the Islamic republic.\n\nThe attacks, a series of coordinated strikes that hit Saudi oil facilites last Saturday, cut the country\u2019s oil production, which accounts for 5 percent of the world\u2019s daily supply, in half. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for what he called \u201can act of war,\u201d though Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed they carried out the attacks. The Saudi government said Iran \u201csponsored\u201d the attacks. Iran has denied responsibility.\n\nThe president said Sunday that the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d ready to respond to the attacks, but said Washington is still working to positively identify the culprit. On Thursday, Iran\u2019s foreign minister warned of an \u201call-out war\u201d should the U.S. launch a military strike.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "President Trump announced Friday that his administration has placed harsh sanctions on Iran's national bank.\"We have just sanctioned the Iranian National Bank \u2014 that is their central banking system \u2014 and it's going to be at the highest level of sanctions,\" Trump told reporters from", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7coSEn3Dcho7Nk.P4LBa_w--~B/aD01Mzc7dz05MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/6c753a3092b5e26e9571650ea44c6efe", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
