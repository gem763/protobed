But he also has said he would consider a smaller-scale deal, sowing confusion about the precise parameters of what he would require to remove tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nAD\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer and other officials in Washington. The two have been holding stop-and-go negotiations for nearly a year. To try to force Chinese officials to negotiate, Trump has slapped tariffs \u2014 or import penalties \u2014 on close to $350 billion in Chinese goods. Tariff rates are set to move higher on Oct. 15, and then even more goods will face import penalties in December.\n\nTrump contends that China must change its trade practices if it wants to make a deal. He has accused the government of stealing intellectual property from U.S. companies, unfairly subsidizing domestic firms, and manipulating its currency to create a trading imbalance. He also has demanded that Beijing boost imports of U.S. agriculture products, such as soybeans and pork.\n\nAD\n\nChinese officials have expressed an openness to some changes but have stopped well short of Trump\u2019s broader demands. There are growing signs that the prolonged standoff is damaging both nations, as economic growth in the U.S. and China have slowed markedly this year.\n\nAD\n\nContinual posturing by White House and Chinese officials has whipsawed the stock market since trade negotiations began in earnest late last year. Some indexes have spiked or plummeted based solely on rumors or partial developments, as traders or computer algorithms react to anything that might be perceived as news.\n\n\u201cThe fact that markets are still trading on China trade talk innuendo is proof positive the algorithms are running the short-term show,\u201d said Nancy Tengler of Tengler Wealth Management. \u201cThose of us who invest our client\u2019s money for the long-term use these bouts of volatility to purchase great companies at a discount and sell expensive holdings to eager buyers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAll 11 stock market sectors were up in Wednesday\u2019s trading, with information technology and energy at the head of the pack.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural that technology is going to rally hard,\u201d said Kenny Polcari, senior market strategist at SlateStone Wealth. \u201cThe tech stocks are the highfliers and get hit the hardest on the way down, and they are the ones that bounce the most on positive trade news.\u201d\n\nThe Dow\u2019s biggest gainers in late morning activity included Visa, American Express, Microsoft, Intel and Cisco.\n\nStocks fell sharply Tuesday \u2014 the Dow slid more than 300 points, or 1.19 percent \u2014 after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and blacklisted several Chinese businesses on allegations their work contributes to the repression of the nation\u2019s Muslim minority population. Since the start of October, Wall Street has bounced between pessimism over weakening U.S. manufacturing data and optimism over record low unemployment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that the number of job openings in August was flat month-over-month at 7.1 million.\n\n\u201cThe peak was 7.626 million openings last November, so the labor market may have passed its peak for hiring demand in this business cycle,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.\n\nRupkey said the data shows American companies \u201cstill want you to come to work for them \u2026 despite the head winds of uncertainty and risks posed by the escalation of the trade war.\"\n\nMeanwhile, investors were preparing Wednesday to digest news from the Federal Reserve, which is slated to release the minutes from its September meeting. The minutes provide clues to what Fed officials are thinking on a host of issues affecting the economy.\n\nAD", "description": "Negotiators are poised to meet in Washington in hopes of resolving the long-running and economically damaging conflict.", "authors": ["Thomas Heath", "Local Business Reporter", "Columnist", "Writing About Entrepreneurs", "Companies In The Washington Metropolitan Area", "Damian Paletta", "Reporter Covering Economic Policy"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e1BstMM1VZUCopd-Xrm_DfDZDos=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2DKDSBXKSUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
