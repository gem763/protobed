The stock hit a new 52-week high of $147.37 in the previous session. ResMed has gained 26.7% since the start of the year compared to the 1% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 11.5% return for the Zacks Medical - Products industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 24, 2019, ResMed reported EPS of $0.93 versus consensus estimate of $0.87 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.63%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ResMed is expected to post earnings of $4.02 per share on $2.86 billion in revenues. This represents a 10.44% change in EPS on a 9.86% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.46 per share on $3.11 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.95% and 8.76%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nResMed may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nResMed has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 35.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 30.6X versus its peer group's average of 16.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.39. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, ResMed currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if ResMed fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though ResMed shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
