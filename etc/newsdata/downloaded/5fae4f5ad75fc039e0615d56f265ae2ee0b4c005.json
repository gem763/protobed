It now requires savers to have an email address.\n\nThere are more than 1 million households with at least one adult over the age of 65 which have no internet access, according to Office for National Statistics figures. And 7 million over-65s have not used internet banking in the past three months.\n\nYet while the top online easy-access account currently pays 1.46 per cent, you'll get as little as 0.1 per cent on the High Street. The 1.36 percentage points difference means \u00a3136 less interest a year on each \u00a310,000.\n\nFor example, HSBC pays 0.15 per cent on its Flexible Saver, which is dropping to 0.1 per cent in December. NatWest offers 0.2 per cent on balances up to \u00a325,000 and 0.3 per cent up to \u00a31 million on its Instant Saver. Barclays pays up to 0.3 per cent on its Everyday Saver, Halifax Instant Saver and Lloyds Standard Saver 0.2 per cent, and Santander Everyday Saver 0.35 per cent.\n\nEven branch users who hunt out better deals can still lose out. Britain's biggest building society, Nationwide, pays 0.41 percentage points less to customers who want to use its branches rather than save online.\n\nIts one-year Triple Access Saver, launched earlier this month, pays 1.21 per cent and limits you to three withdrawals a year. But it's only available online at this rate of interest.\n\nOpen the account through a branch and you are fobbed off with a much lower 0.75 per cent.\n\nLeeds BS new Limited Issue Online Access Cash Isa is also out of bounds for those who don't use the internet. At 1.4 per cent it offers one of the top tax-free cash Isa rates on \u00a31,000 or more. But if you want a branch-based account, you are paid a lower 1.3 per cent on its Double Access Cash Isa.\n\nUnlike the online account, this also limits you to two withdrawals a year and you must keep at least \u00a35,000 in the account.\n\nYorkshire BS also reserves the 1.4 per cent rate on its 1 Year Limited Access Saver to online savers.\n\nIts similar branch account Annual Access pays a lower 1.3 per cent. Both accounts also restrict you to making withdrawals on just one day a year.\n\nThe new Saga Easy Access account pays 1.4 per cent with no withdrawal restrictions.\n\nThe over-50s specialist has teamed up with global financial giant, Goldman Sachs International, to offer the account.\n\nYou can operate it online or by phone \u2014 but you still need an email address to open it. Saga says the email address is an important part of the security checks Goldman Sachs uses to protect a customer's accounts. But some providers have taken a different approach. The new Triple Access Saver from Coventry BS pays the same 1.46 per cent whether you open and run it online, through the post or by visiting its branches.\n\nYou are limited to three withdrawals a year and the rate includes a 0.31 percentage point bonus payable until 2021.\n\nOnline provider, Charter Savings Bank has opened up a postal version of its Easy Access Account after research pinpointed demand from savers. It offers a simple savings account with no withdrawal restrictions and no bonus. The rate is 1.35 pc on a minimum \u00a35,000.\n\nYou add to your account by electronic transfer or a cheque from the account you elect to link to your savings.\n\nKent Reliance pays 1.43 per cent through its Easy Access account if you open it online or through its limited branch network \u2014 or 1.3 per cent if you run it through the post.\n\nMoney is pouring into easy-access accounts as savers, nervous of what will happen to interest rates, keep their money to hand rather than tying it up in fixed-rate bonds.\n\nNearly \u00a39 out of every \u00a310 in easy-access accounts is sitting with the big banks, trusted by older savers.\n\nThese big institutions hold \u00a3664 billion of our savings in easy-access accounts out of a total \u00a3759 billion.", "description": "Millions of older savers who do not use the internet are being abandoned by some banks and building societies.", "authors": ["Sylvia Morris For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
