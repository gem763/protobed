We're simply indexing that data in a more searchable way, the administrators of \"Boycott MAGA\" wrote on their Facebook page. \"We do not encourage violence against Trump supporters. We simply support ridiculing them, alienating them, and refusing to patronize businesses run by them.\"\n\nTelevision station KDKA reported that the group claims they have already identified nearly 100 businesses in the Pittsburgh area that are owned by Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important because people have a right to know where their money is going,\u201d Pittsburgh blogger Brian Broome told the television station.\n\nThe organization has created a website that promises to \"do economic damage to small businesses owned by supporters of Donald Trump via boycotts and other completely legal methods.\"\n\nThey also plan to leave damaging reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.\n\n\"We intend to not only go after the major corporations who donate to this toxic excuse for a president \u2013 we will be listing businesses of all sizes that are owned by Trump supporters,\" they wrote. \"We will also be taking measures to ensure that no conservative will have access to this listing, as to prevent them from patronizing these businesses.\"\n\nAllegheny County councilman Sam DeMarco told the television station that the planned boycotts are dangerous.\n\n\u201cThey want to cost people their livelihoods just because you don\u2019t agree with them politically,\" he said. \u201cWhere does it stop? This is insane.\u201d\n\nThe militant sex and gender revolutionaries used similar tactics against supporters of traditional marriage in California and Maryland.\n\nIn one instance, leftist thugs protested outside a diner because a waitress had given money to support the fight to defend the biblical definition of marriage.\n\nAnd of course - in world history - there are instances of people being targeted and boycotted because of their beliefs. Fascism is an ugly business.\n\nAuthor's Note: Click here to pre-order Todd's upcoming book, \"Culture Jihad: How to Stop the Left From Killing a Nation.\"", "description": "There is a national effort under way, by leftist thugs, .09/06/2019 22:11:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/50/bba9d20f-03dc-41e5-b8c9-99dd6490a528.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
