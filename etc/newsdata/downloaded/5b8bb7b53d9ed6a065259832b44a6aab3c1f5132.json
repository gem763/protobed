In Washington, decisions are punted into the future, but vacation begins promptly on schedule.\n\nOperating under a continuing resolution means the defense budget will stay at 2019 levels at least until Nov. 21, by which time presumably Congress can pass full-year appropriations bills.\n\nFurthermore, because the resolution was not agreed upon until the last day of the fiscal year, the Department of Defense as well as the other departments had to issue instructions on how to operate in case of a shutdown, which means a substantial waste of time and resources went to preparing plans and making provisions for a shutdown of unknown duration.\n\nIn the meantime, the Department of Defense will have to live with substantial limitations on what it can do and how it can re-shape its programs to meet the needs outlined by the still-new National Defense Strategy.\n\nContinuing resolutions have become the rule in recent years, and they continue to impose substantial costs on the military in terms of lost time for training, budget execution, and wasteful duplicative work.\n\nLosses in time for training and maintenance cannot be recouped with money, and the uncertainty of not having full-year appropriations in place mean training must be scaled back into the following year.\n\nA continuing resolution also crunches the timeline for new equipment programs, since it does not allow systems that were not in last year\u2019s budget to begin. A project scheduled to start in October can\u2019t begin if funding into the new year is uncertain. These projects literally start behind schedule.\n\nThe Pentagon has identified three projects\u2014all high priorities in its efforts to modernize the military\u2014that will be damaged by this irresponsible approach to spending legislation.\n\nHypersonic weapons, which Defense Department leaders will be key for prevailing in great power competition, will be hurt by the inability to make the long lead-time purchases necessary to keep the program on track.\n\nHelicopter training will be set back because the 32 training helicopters needed to replace the TH-57 Sea Ranger Fleet, which has been training naval officers since the 1970s, will have delayed delivery.\n\nB-52 bombers, many of which date from 1960 or earlier and operate with some of their original components, will have to wait to have GPS interfaces installed.\n\nThese giant planes are still heavily used and expected to be operational until the 2050s. The GPS interfaces are critical to their readiness and capabilities. Lack of a full-year appropriations bill means assembly will delayed and the program will have to wait to be upgraded.\n\n\u201cEvery day that we have a CR means it\u2019s a day that \u2026 everything is impaired,\u201d Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said of the damage done by continuing resolutions.\n\n\u201cNot only if this drags on for weeks, months, but it could [end] up being a year-long continuing resolution. That is devastating to our military readiness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope Congress gets this message when it returns on Oct. 15.", "description": "President Donald Trump and Congress did what they had to do to get out of town for Congress\u2019 two-week recess last\u00a0Friday, agreeing on a continuing resolution that is a symbol of Congress\u2019 inability to finish work on its primary responsibility: to \u201dpay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.\u201d", "authors": ["Frederico Bartels", "Commentary By", "Policy Analyst For Defense Budgeting", "Fall Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-1153196349.jpg?itok=bL-x6v6N", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
