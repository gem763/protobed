But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates..\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTo make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) \u2014 or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or the District of Columbia.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c1/b3/22fbb74f4b7bbfe2379bcae67213/191017-2020-candidates-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
