The Tass report cited SANA coverage of Syrian military units moving into the northern part of the country to push back against the Turkish incursion and \u201cprotect the civilian population,\u201d which was said to be very happy with the arrival of Syrian troops.\n\nKurdish leaders reportedly made an agreement with the Assad regime for protection against the Turks, as reported by CNN on Monday:\n\nAn autonomous administration set up by the Kurds, which covers a wide swathe of north and east Syria, said Sunday that it was the Syrian government\u2019s duty to protect its borders and sovereignty. \u201cThis agreement offers an opportunity to liberate the rest of the Syrian territories and cities occupied by the Turkish army as Afrin and other Syrian cities and towns,\u201d the statement said. The group added on Monday that is was in the process of agreeing a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d on the protection of the border with the Russian side.\n\nSANA reported Syrian military units arriving in the crucial border town of Manbij, which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday would be the next target of his invasion force unless it is \u201ccleared\u201d of \u201cterrorist organizations.\u201d\n\nThis was evidently a reference to the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey considers an arm of the PKK terrorist organization. A deal with the U.S. that would ostensibly have removed YPG forces from Manbij was never completed.\n\nSyrian officials told Russian media on Monday that Syrian government troops have been invited into the key Kurdish-controlled city of Kobane, and suggested Russian forces could be deployed to Manbij to prevent the Turks from attacking there. As of Monday afternoon, there had been no official confirmation from Moscow of Russian forces moving into Manbij.", "description": "Syrian media reports demonstrations against both the Turkish invasion and the continued presence of U.S. troops on Syrian soil.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Turkish-forces-in-Syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
