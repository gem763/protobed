Prices often do the same, as dip buyers speculate the descent was too hard and too fast. But that expected bounce doesn't appear to be happening this time, since today marks the second week of depressed prices.\n\nThe initial drop of 5.66% for took place on Sept. 17, its biggest one-day sell off since Aug. 1 \u2014 when it plunged 7.9% after the Fed dampened hopes for a and rising U.S. output kept supplies high \u2014 after the drone strikes halved the Saudi\u2019s 10% global supply.\n\nHowever, a faster-than-expected Saudi recovery and ongoing trade jitters amidst a wider global slowdown kept oil prices depressed.\n\nAnd the pattern now developing increases the odds for another downturn, as a look at the charts demonstrates.\n\nWTI Daily Chart\n\nThe price of WTI is flirting with a downside breakout of a pennant continuation pattern, after opening at the lowest level since June 18.\n\nThe pennant is a consolidation after a sharp decline, in this case a 14% drop from the Sept. 23, $59.39 high and the Oct. 3, $50.99 low. The pennant shaped range that follows demonstrates apparent equal supply and demand, squeezing the price till it breaks out.\n\nShould oil break to the downside, it would demonstrate that the bearish sentiment hasn\u2019t ended, with sellers drowning out the available demand within the contracting price range in the pennant. It would also signal they're now lowering offers to find more willing buyers.\n\nThis move is expected to trigger long positions and increase short positions. Given that the implied target of $8 from the downside breakout, measured by the above-mentioned downward-move, would include a breakdown of a major support area above the psychological $50 level since June 5, it could be the writing on the wall for an even worse plunge.\n\nThe $50 support has been priming a triple bottom since June. Its failure would reverse the market mechanics, with bulls tracking back positions and bears encouraged to step harder, propelling prices even further down.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders may wait for a significant close below the $50 level, followed by an attempted but failed rally, to short oil.\n\nModerate traders would wait for the same but not necessarily for proof of resistance, only to ride the return move for its entry closer to the new presumed resistance.\n\nAggressive traders may short at will, providing they do so with a trading plan that fits their account risk.\n\nTrade Sample \u2013 Short Position\n\n\n\nEntry: $52.50\n\nStop-Loss: $53.00, above today\u2019s high\n\nRisk: $0.50\n\nTarget (NYSE: ): $51.00, above the Oct. 3 low\n\nReward: $1.50\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: Target Corporation, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
