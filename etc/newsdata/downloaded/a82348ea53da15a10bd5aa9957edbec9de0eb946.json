Kamala Harris speaks at a townhall on LGBTQ issues in Los Angeles, Calif., October 10, 2019. (Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nWe keep you informed on the Democrats\u2019 aspirations to rule by decree.\n\nAs Democratic voters across the country watch their party\u2019s presidential hopefuls clamber over one another in a race to the left, National Review is undertaking a far more promising venture: our 2019 Fall Webathon. Among the many reasons we\u2019re counting on your generous support is so that we can continue observing, reporting on, analyzing, and critiquing the Democratic primary, giving you all the coverage you could want of the lead-up to next year\u2019s general election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Jim Geraghty detailed some of our efforts on this front earlier this month, noting how closely and carefully National Review\u2019s many writers have been tracking the presidential-primary race from a number of angles. Considering that the Democratic field was made up of more than 20 candidates at its peak, there\u2019s been quite a lot to keep tabs on.\n\nFor my part, I\u2019ve been closely following the Democrats\u2019 consistent leftward shift on the issue of abortion. In the most recent primary debate, for instance, all twelve candidates on stage managed to avoid answering the simplest, most fundamental question: \u201cDo you support any limitations on abortion and, if so, what?\u201d (But perhaps the evasion on the issue wasn\u2019t entirely their fault: The debate\u2019s moderators refused even to pose the question.)\n\nNot only do we here at National Review do what we can to make sure you have the latest news about the race, and helpful commentary to go along with it, but we focus our reporting and analysis on the foibles of particular Democratic candidates with some regularity \u2014 and given the many weak candidates in the field, we\u2019ve had no shortage of opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake Kamala Harris, former attorney general of California and now the state\u2019s junior senator, who has spent the overwhelming majority of her presidential campaign insisting that she\u2019ll overstep the constitutional bounds of enumerated presidential powers in order to fix everything that she thinks is wrong with our republic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs David French put it in a piece over the summer, Harris seems to think she\u2019s running for queen. Her comprehensive immigration plan would use executive action alone to create a path to citizenship for millions of \u201cDreamers,\u201d illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. She also has promised to create a new version of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, unilaterally permitting parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to apply for deferred action on their immigration status.\n\nDuring the most recent debate, Harris promised that she\u2019d enact a regime of \u201cpre-clearance,\u201d using her administration to block state laws that her Department of Justice deems contradictory to Roe v. Wade. Harris is one of several Democratic candidates who back a federal bill that would block any state law that attempts to limit abortion, even in the last three months of pregnancy. And her authoritarian instincts aren\u2019t restricted to dictating her preferred abortion policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her remarks at the Democrats\u2019 climate-change town hall, Harris vowed to abolish the legislative filibuster in the Senate in order to pass a Green New Deal over what she called Republican obstruction of progress. Earlier this year, she pledged that, if Congress fails to send gun-control legislation to her desk during her first 100 days as president, she would immediately take executive action to enact such measures herself.\n\nIn other words, Harris is barely even bothering to try to conceal her authoritarian impulses. She seems to think winning the presidency would grant her the right to ignore Congress and decree her own will via executive action \u2014 and that we\u2019d all be better off for it.\n\nHere at National Review, we spend our days following the crazy plans of Harris and her fellow Democrats so you\u2019ll know exactly where the Left is headed. Your contribution to our Webathon \u2014 not only to support our continued, careful election coverage but also to fund our costly legal effort to defend free speech in Mann v. National Review \u2014 is absolutely essential in that work. We are deeply grateful for any support you can offer, no matter the size. We can\u2019t do this without you. You can make a contribution here.\n\n", "description": "For decades, National Review has been fighting the Democratic tendency to ignore limits on governmental power if they conflict with the Left's policy goals.", "authors": ["Alexandra Desanctis", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
