The Turks may have almost all the military advantages in this fight, but they can't afford for their push to get bogged down, so they will attempt to seize their objectives quickly.\n\nSo far, it appears that Turkey's initial aim is to split the territory held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) near the Turkish-Syrian border by driving down the middle to seize key roads linking the western and eastern parts of northeastern Syria. If successful, Turkey could further isolate the SDF holdings in the north and pave the way for additional assaults.\n\nThe operation is focused on the territory between the border towns of Tal Abyad in the west and Ras al-Ayn in the east. The Turkish spearheads are attempting to advance around the two towns, which are about 110 kilometers (68 miles) apart, and then drive down to the M4 highway about 30-35 kilometers away that runs on a parallel course to the border. Aside from Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, both of which have a population of about 200,000, this territory is relatively sparsely populated and flat. The terrain and the dearth of major urban centers will significantly facilitate the Turkish advance, unlike the situation its military faced during its operations in Afrin and northern Aleppo.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Ankara wants to be sure it takes its objectives.", "authors": ["Stratfor Worldview"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m7j2J3i_H0Fr9MCsqovkuA--~B/aD05OTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/14a19a8a62ae99b70505c5db6f331c09", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
