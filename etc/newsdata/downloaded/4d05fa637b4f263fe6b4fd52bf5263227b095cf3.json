Businesses were encouraged to close early.\n\n\u201cWe do not want the citizens of Halifax roaming downtown as the water is coming in,\u201d said Erica Fleck, assistant chief of community risk reduction in Halifax, the provincial capital and home to 400,000 people.\n\nA crane toppled and crashed into the side of a downtown apartment building under construction. In the city\u2019s south end, a roof was ripped off an apartment complex, and firefighter Jeff Paris said several apartment buildings were being evacuated. With the collapsed crane and all the down trees and power lines, it\u2019s fortunate there are no significant injuries or deaths, he said.\n\nPhotos: Hurricane Dorian Lashes East Coast; Bahamas Reel Storm is causing flooding, tornadoes and power outages as it moves north The Abaco Islands in the Bahamas were hit hard by Hurricane Dorian. marco bello/Reuters 1 of 19 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 of 19 Show Caption The Abaco Islands in the Bahamas were hit hard by Hurricane Dorian. marco bello/Reuters\n\nAs Canada prepared for Dorian, floodwaters receded Saturday from North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, leaving behind a muddy trail of destruction. The storm\u2019s worst damage in the U.S. appeared to be on Ocracoke Island, which even in good weather is accessible only by boat or air and is popular with tourists for its undeveloped beaches. Longtime residents who waited out the storm described strong but manageable winds followed by a wall of water that flooded the first floors of many homes and forced some to await rescue from their attics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to cleaning up dead limbs and trash that\u2019s floating around,\u201d said Ocracoke Island resident and business owner Philip Howard. \u201cBut now it\u2019s everything: picnic tables, doors, lumber that\u2019s been floating around.\u201d\n\nGov. Roy Cooper said about 800 people had remained on the island to wait out Dorian. The storm made landfall Friday morning over the Outer Banks. Yet despite having been downgraded to a Category 1 storm, it still sent seawater surging into homes on Ocracoke.\n\nMore than 1,100 Bahamians arrived in Palm Beach, Fla., after being evacuated by cruise ship from their hurricane-battered islands.\n\nThe Grand Celebration cruise ship returned to its home port after setting sail Thursday for Freeport, Grand Bahama, to deliver more than 112 tons of supplies and ferry dozens of health workers and emergency crews.\n\nThe storm made landfall Saturday evening near Sambro Creek, about 15 miles south of Halifax with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph.\n\nDorian swept across Nova Scotia and forecasters expected it to pass near or over Prince Edward Island late Saturday, and then move to Newfoundland and Labrador on Sunday.\n\nSupplies heading for Ocracoke Island on Friday.

Karen Hutt, the utility\u2019s chief executive, said Dorian is the largest weather event the company had ever responded to, and 1,000 workers were ready to restore power once it is safe.\n\nHurricanes in Canada are somewhat rare in part because once the storms reach colder Canadian waters, they lose their main source of energy. Canadian Hurricane Centre meteorologist Ian Hubbard said the last hurricanes to make landfall in Canada were Hurricane Igor and Hurricane Earl in September 2010.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami said Dorian was officially a posttropical cyclone, not a hurricane, though it still packed hurricane-force winds.\n\nDorian lashed the eastern tip of Maine with heavy rain, strong winds and high surf as the storm passed offshore. Several hundred homes and businesses lost power.\n\nIn North Carolina, the governor said officials were aware of no serious injuries on the Outer Banks from the storm. About 200 people were in shelters and 45,000 without power as of midday Saturday, according to the governor\u2019s office. Emergency officials transported fuel trucks, generators, food and water to Okracoke.\n\nAt least five deaths in the Southeast were blamed on Dorian. Four were men in Florida or North Carolina who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the hurricane. North Carolina officials said a 67-year-old man died Friday in Pamlico County after he collapsed while cleaning storm debris.\n\nDorian slammed the Bahamas at the start of the week with 185 mph winds, killing at least 43 people and obliterating countless homes. From there, it swept past Florida and Georgia, then sideswiped the Carolinas on Thursday, spinning off tornadoes that peeled away roofs and flipped recreational vehicles.\n\nThe storm\u2019s worst damage in the U.S. appeared to be on Ocracoke Island.
