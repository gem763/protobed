He also stopped taking testosterone in a bid to become pregnant.\n\nMr McConnell started his journey to fatherhood in 2016 and had to stop taking testosterone so that he could conceive. On his second attempt Freddy fell pregnant using a sperm donor\n\nLawyers say the child will be the first person born in England and Wales not to legally have a mother if the claim succeeds.\n\nMr McConnell was filmed over three years as part of a documentary.\n\nThe film 'Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth', shows Freddy giving up testosterone so that he is able to conceive and ends up living in gender limbo.\n\nAfter a few months carrying his son, Mr McConnell bemoans: 'If all men got pregnant then pregnancy would be taken so more seriously and talked about.\n\nAfter one failed attempt, Freddy falls pregnant on his second try using a sperm donor and shares the moment with his mum\n\n'F***, it\u2019s f***ing awful. If men had to go through this all the time you would never hear the end of it.'\n\nHe also explains that being filmed for the documentary was much more difficult than he anticipated.\n\n'I think I totally underestimated the difficulty of being on camera and being filmed a lot. I remember thinking \u201cthis is really odd I\u2019ll get used to it\u201d, but I never got used to it.'\n\nHe said of his decision to undertake his journey: 'This is a film about me having a baby. But what I feel like I\u2019m going through isn\u2019t me having a baby or pregnancy, it\u2019s a much more fundamental total loss of myself.'", "description": "Freddy McConnell, 32,  from Deal, Kent, wants to be registered as father or parent.
