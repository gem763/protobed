That\u2019s all they do, they love to climb mountains \u2026 some of them were champions,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cAnd we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb \u2026 this wall can\u2019t be climbed.\u201d\n\nHis remarks were taken as a challenge by 75-year-old Rick Weber, co-founder of Muir Valley, a rock climbing park and nature reserve in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t tell a bona fide rock climber something\u2019s impossible to climb,\u201d he told Time magazine.\n\nMr Weber, a retired engineer, decided to build a replica of Mr Trump\u2019s wall using official dimensions and recent images of the structure.\n\nHe wrote in to popular climbing magazine Rock & Ice to announce a climbing competition on 11 and 12 October to coincide with Rocktoberfest, one of the largest annual gatherings of climbers in the US.\n\n\u201cNo one in our climbing community knows any of these 20 mountaineers. I doubt if they exist,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMore importantly, to declare something to be impossible to climb to a bona fide rock climber is to issue a challenge.\n\n\u201cSo, I decided to build an exact replica and hold a competition.\u201d\n\nAhead of the official competition, several people had already managed to climb the wall.\n\nAmong these was eight-year-old Lucy Hancock, who climbed the replica using a belay \u2013 a rope that acts as a safety measure, rather than an aid. Footage showed her scaling the majority of the wall in little more than a minute.\n\nErik Kloeker, a 29-year-old climbing guide and property manager at Muir Valley who told The Courier Journal he had been climbing for nine years, climbed the structure in about 30 seconds in a demonstration.\n\n\u201cThe border wall that they\u2019re building could be climbed pretty easily,\u201d said Mr Kloeker, who juggled several items in one hand during repeat attempts.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s border wall is being built at heights of 18-feet and 30-feet, consisting of singular pillars and a larger panel along the top.\n\nMr Weber told Time that as the large top panel is the same size, a climber who manages to ascend pillars of the 18-foot version would have no difficulty scaling the additional distance.\n\nHe decided to allow climbers to hold on to the side of the top panel, as he claimed such gaps existed between each section of wall in the real designs.\n\nThe retired engineer said a wall without pillars would be far more difficult to climb.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making an argument that we shouldn\u2019t have a secure border. I\u2019m not doing that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is to make sure that we\u2019re not blowing a lot of money on some silly nonsense of putting up something that he thinks can\u2019t be climbed. Because it can. And will be.\u201d\n\nDuring his September visit to the San Diego border, Mr Trump claimed hopeful climbers would \u201chave to bring hoses and waters [sic]\u201d to combat the large top panel of the design, which he said was designed to absorb enough heat to \u201dfry an egg\u201d.\n\nMr Trump recently denied making enquiries about creating a moat filled with alligators and snakes along the border.\n\nDespite campaigning on the promise that Mexico would pay for the structure, the Defence Department has been forced to divert some $3.6bn in military funding.\n\nRead more\n\nRock climbers to challenge Trump\u2019s claim border wall cannot be scaled\n\nUS faces \u2018risk of exploding planes\u2019 due to border wall funding\n\nTrump reveals border wall details, after army general asks him not to", "description": "An 18-foot replica of Donald Trump\u2019s border wall has been scaled in a matter of seconds by novice climbers, an eight-year-old girl and a man who returned for another attempt while juggling with one hand.The US president described his wall as \u201cvirtually impenetrable\u201d during a trip to the US-Mexico border", "authors": ["Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.zocd3Y05sFQtwBbk304FA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/1316da94c7aa993bf43faa34de4c5675", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
