These are unrealistic for women, given the time they spend out of the workforce, contributing to their families and the community as carers and volunteers,' said Ms Helyar-Moray.\n\nThe prominent equality campaigner, with over 20 years financial services marketing, said she wanted to reward women for their unpaid work.\n\nThe work Australian women do raising children, caring for loved ones or volunteering has been valued by PWC at $2.2 trillion per year.\n\n'Super Rewards was created to recognise the invaluable work undertaken in homes across the nation and provide women with an opportunity to contribute to their super every day, she said.", "description": "Super-rewards launched earlier this month to help address the issue of women retiring in poverty.
