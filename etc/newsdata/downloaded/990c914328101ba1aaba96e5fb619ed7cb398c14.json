They brought their mobile phones \u2014 forbidden in such a secure facility \u2014 and refused to leave so investigators could begin interviewing Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper. They chanted \"Let us in,\" sat down and ordered some pizza.\n\nAfter they left, the group stood in front of a bank of cameras so their putative spokesman, 37-year-old second-term Rep. Matt Gaetz, could shout about how unfair it is that the Democratic-controlled House is following rules laid out in 2015 (when Republicans controlled the chamber) by keeping members who aren't part of the three investigating committees out of the depositions.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOf course, many of the members who stood behind Gaetz were members of those committees. But that wasn't the point of the stunt. The point was to perform for their audience of one, with whom Gaetz and a number of them had met the day before.\n\nAnd the audience responded, showing his gratitude in a tweet praising the group's blatant security breach the next day. \"Thank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History,\" the president tweeted.\n\nOn Thursday, it was Senator Lindsey Graham's turn to demonstrate his fealty by introducing a non-binding Senate resolution \u2014 co-sponsored by all but eight Senate Republicans \u2014 which he unveiled at an afternoon press conference.\n\n\"The purpose of the resolution is to let the house know that the process [they] are engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is out of bounds, is inconsistent with due process as we know it, it is a Star Chamber type inquiry, it is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past regarding impeachment of other presidents,\" Graham said.\n\nLike the other Trump defender, Graham's concern was mainly with the closed-door depositions \u2014 despite the fact that he, as one of the House \"managers\" during the inquiry into then-president Bill Clinton, had conducted plenty of closed-door interviews of witnesses. Indeed, not only did Graham conduct similar proceedings during the Clinton impeachment, but Republicans on the House Benghazi select committee conducted more than 100 closed-door interviews when investigating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhen I asked Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor, if he would ever allow witnesses in one of his cases to see other witnesses testify and gain the ability to synchronize their stories, Graham gave a long, rambling answer which ended up invoking the investigation the Justice Department is currently conducting to examine the Trump-Russia probe.\n\nI pointed out that the impeachment investigation is not about anything that happened in 2016. Graham replied: \"Well, it is to me.\"\n\nOne Democrat who I spoke to about the week's events -- Illinois Senator Richard Durbin -- suggested that his GOP colleagues' actions were evidence of the weakness of Trump's case after Taylor's testimony blew away the \"no quid pro quo\" defense.\n\n\"After the testimony of Ambassador Taylor, they were looking for some sort of theatrical presentation and I suppose that was the best they could find,\" Durbin said, adding later that he understood where the Republicans were coming from. \u201cLet me tell you, I've been in desperate political situations before and you just strike out at the pain,\" he said. \"When it was a president of my party, we talked about process all the time. But ultimately we had to face the substance, and ultimately, they will too.\"\n\nBut some Republicans I spoke with were far less sympathetic. Paul Rosenzweig, who was one of Ken Starr's deputies during the Clinton impeachment probe, had harsh words for the arguments put forth by Graham, Gaetz, and their GOP compatriots.\n\n\"Almost nothing that the Republicans have complained about in terms of process has any constitutional merit,\" said Rosenzweig, now a senior fellow at the R Street Institute. \"The Republicans on the Benghazi committee conducted dozens of closed-door depositions before they had open hearings, and I didn't hear the Republicans complaining then. They are clearly trying to make a political point, but their political point really emphasizes the fact that they have neither the law nor the facts on their side, so they have to invade a SCIF instead.\"\n\nRosenzweig's impressions of the evidence that has been publicly reported so far was equally blunt. \u201cAmbassador Taylor's testimony was particularly trenchant and, uh, adverse to the president\u2019s interests, both in suggesting that most of what he's been saying so far is untrue, and in directly suggesting that he understood that [Trump] had conditioned the delivery of foreign aid on securing personal benefits,\" he said. \"That makes the diplomatic exchange one that is corrupted by the president's intent, and thus both impeachable and quite possibly criminal.\"\n\nAnother Republican I spoke with, former Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo, said that some of his ex-colleagues\u2019 concerns with how Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has handled things might be legitimate. But he was not so generous in his assessment of Gaetz and the other SCIF stormers' motivations: \u201dAt the end of the day, Republicans don't want to face the facts and don't want to talk about what happened because they can't defend it, and they shouldn't try to. So the best available strategy right now is to make these process arguments and to jump in front of the camera.\"\n\nWhile some Republicans are willing to commit egregious security breaches in defense of the president, Curbelo explained that Trump might still have reason to be worried about the rest of the GOP caucus: \u201dIt's not all Republicans \u2014 it's not even most of the Republicans,\" he said. This is being led by a small group who are Paladins for the president\u201d. A significant number of others, Curbelo said, are \"quietly watching this and processing and digesting the facts as they become known.\"\n\nWhile he cautioned that many of his former colleagues are \"waiting for the American people to lead by voicing their opinions,\" he told me there is definitely an \"erosion of support\" for Trump in the GOP caucus: \u201dPeople are embarrassed about all of this. Mick Mulvaney's performance the other day shocked a lot of my former colleagues, so right now this is not going the right way for the president. This marriage with Trump is starting to be very costly.\"\n\n\"With each passing day, a small number of Republican Senators and House members lose a little more confidence in the president and his administration\u2026 nothing that the president is doing right now is stopping it.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint.
