The floodgates for cross-division opportunities could open after that, though, and Jones would be near the top of the list of potential matchups after their feud flared up again during fight week.\n\nShould it happen, Cormier said size would definitely be a cause for concern on Adesanya\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just small,\u201d Cormier said on ESPN\u2019s UFC 243 wrap-up show. \u201cHe\u2019s just small for Jones. Jones is a big guy, and I think people underestimate how big he is when he grabs you because he\u2019s so big up top. They make fun of how small his legs are, but he\u2019s 225 (pounds). But a lot of the weight is on top, and it\u2019s almost like he hangs on you. It\u2019s like a towel when you\u2019re in the clinch, and I think Izzy may struggle with that because Jones is so big.\u201d\n\nPrior to UFC 243, company president Dana White endorsed the idea of a fight between Adesanya and Jones if \u201cThe Last Stylebender\u201d came out with a win against Whittaker. It doesn\u2019t appear as if that fight will be next, but the building blocks are coming together for it to happen.\n\nCormier, who has fought Jones twice and said he\u2019s discussed training with Adesanya in the past, is a fan of the potential matchup. He said it would be compelling if it was a standup fight. However, he reiterated size would be a problem for Adesanya unless he alters his physique ahead of the contest.\n\n\u201cI would not mind watching them fight because if Jones has to stand with this guy, he\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cJones is very hittable. But Izzy needs to get a lot bigger if he\u2019s going to fight this guy.\u201d\n\nGallery Israel Adesanya def.
