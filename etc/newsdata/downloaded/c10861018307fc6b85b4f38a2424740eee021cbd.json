Photo: Rio Viera-Newton\n\nAs you likely already know, since I talk about it more or less nonstop, I strive to keep my daytime makeup look as clean, simple, and natural-looking as possible. On an average Monday, I\u2019ll add some life back into my skin with my Em Cosmetics blush, spot-conceal with my Ilia, and fake some luminosity with Glossier\u2019s haloscope. Done.\n\nHowever, my obsession with keeping my makeup undetectable to the human eye disappears the second the sun goes down. In the evenings, I transform like a beauty werewolf: I use contour to chisel out my cheeks, full-coverage foundation to perfect my complexion, and crazy colors on my lids. Below, a list of my all-time favorite products for glamming up my routine.\n\nBite Beauty Multistick in Mochi These little blush sticks from Bite are a very special hybrid product: They go on like a cream, (they\u2019re very blend-able and easy to apply), but they dry like a powder (which means they last all night long). I especially love the deep red shade, Mochi. $24 at Sephora Buy\n\nMilk Makeup Matte Bronzer During the day I stick a big, fluffy brush in this product then lightly swipe it all over my face to give my skin a nice, soft bronze. But at night, I swipe the stick directly along my cheekbones for a perfectly chiseled-looking contour, then buff it out with my Motd Buffing Base Boss brush. It blends into my skin so easily, and gives me the best faux cheekbones in the world. $24 at Sephora Buy\n\nCharlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick in Pillow Talk I\u2019ve gushed before about how this nude-y pink from Charlotte Tilbury is the best your-lips-but-better shade. For evenings, it\u2019s especially dreamy \u2014 it\u2019s matte, but not overly drying, and makes your lips look plump and pillowy. $34 at Sephora Buy\n\nGlossier Play Colorslide I\u2019ve been using Glossier\u2019s Colorslide eyeliners constantly lately; they have the most beautiful shades and the formula makes it incredibly easy to use. It\u2019s waxy but not insanely pigmented, so if you decide you want a touch of color on the lids but aren\u2019t quite ready for a liquid bright blue cat-eye, this is the perfect thing. I like to run it quickly along my upper lashes for a super easy, practically impossible-to-mess-up cat-eye or accent. My favorite colors at the moment are Nectar, a mustard yellow; Jumbo, a gingery orange; and Adult Swim, a deep navy. $15 at Glossier Buy\n\nCharlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter When I\u2019m going out at night, I practically dip my face in this product. It\u2019s perfect! After I\u2019ve done my foundation and concealer, I apply this to the high points on my face \u2014 cheekbones, upper lip, brow bone, and chin \u2014 and it gives off the most gorgeous sheen. It\u2019s an incredible product that I truly never let myself run out of, and if you haven\u2019t tried it yet, I must insist that you do. $44 at Sephora Buy\n\nFenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt'r Instant Retouch Setting Powder To make sure my makeup stays in place all night, I finish by sweeping this setting powder (which I keep in my purse at all times) from Fenty all over my face. It\u2019s very fine, so it never makes the skin look strange and cakey, and gives zero flashback in photos. $32 at Sephora Buy\n\nKush High Volume Mascara I get my lashes tinted and lifted by Jasmine Imani (it\u2019s sort of like a lash perm) every six months, which means my eyelashes look big and dramatic on their own. But when it\u2019s starting to wear off, I like using Milk Makeup\u2019s Kush Mascara \u2014 it makes my lashes look really big and fluffy. $24 at Sephora Buy $24 at Milk Makeup Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
