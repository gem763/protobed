A lot more.\n\nIn an interview with me, Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and is the de facto head of the inquiry, provided a hint as to how more information might emerge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith new indications emerging of Trump\u2019s stonewalling, Schiff vowed that Democrats would \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of Trump\u2019s corruption and misconduct, \u201cno matter how hard the president fights us.\u201d\n\nMoments ago, Trump directed a key witness \u2014 Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union \u2014 not to testify to Congress, as he was scheduled to do on Tuesday. Sondland has indicated he will not appear.\n\nSign up to receive Opinions pieces in your inbox six days a week\n\nDemocrats were set to question Sondland about his role in a series of recently released text message exchanges that deeply incriminate the president. They show that Trump conditioned a White House meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on his willingness to carry out Trump\u2019s corrupt scheme to rig the next election on his behalf.\n\nAD\n\nThose texts also suggested a possible quid pro quo in which hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid \u2014 which Trump froze just before talking to Zelensky on July 25 \u2014 were also conditioned on doing Trump\u2019s political bidding.\n\nAD\n\nOn two occasions, Ambassador William \u201cBill\u201d Taylor texted to Sondland that he objected to such a quid pro quo involving that military assistance. In one exchange, Sondland denied there was any quid pro quo before abruptly signing off. No wonder Trump doesn\u2019t want him talking.\n\nBut Taylor, the U.S. charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, could shed a lot of light on this whole affair. Schiff said in our interview that Democrats want to ask Taylor about it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe certainly do have an interest in speaking with him,\u201d Schiff told me. Schiff noted that the text messages \u201cprovide strong suggestions\u201d that Trump\u2019s \u201csuspension of military aid\u201d may be \u201ctied\u201d to his demands of Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWe think that Ambassador Taylor is a potentially important witness on the subject,\u201d Schiff said. He declined to go into detail about when this might happen, citing a reluctance to share too much about specific witnesses.\n\nAD\n\nYou\u2019d think that could be quite revelatory. After all, Taylor had a reason for sounding the alarm about this quid pro quo \u2014 something he saw, heard, witnessed or knows led him to believe Trump had made the military aid conditional on Zelensky carrying out his designs. Indeed, in one text exchange, Taylor alludes to a phone conversation with Sondland in which they appeared to have argued over the matter.\n\nAD\n\nThis seems particularly urgent, now that the White House has blocked Sondland from testifying.\n\nDemocrats may go to court\n\nSchiff also hinted at where this all might end up going in another way: He told me that Democrats have not ruled out going to court to try to enforce subpoenas the White House has resisted, as some previous reporting had suggested.\n\nAs of now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo still has not complied with the Democrats\u2019 subpoena seeking a tranche of documents. Meanwhile, the White House is resisting another subpoena demanding materials that would certainly be illuminating.\n\nAD\n\nThose White House materials include the full transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, a full list of White House staffers who were aware of the call or communicated about how to stash it on the super-secret computer system, and all communications and documents related to Trump\u2019s decision to suspend the military aid.\n\nAD\n\nThere has been some suggestion that Democrats would give up on the courts, and merely take all of this stonewalling and make it the subject of an article of impeachment for obstructing Congress.\n\nBut Schiff told me that Democrats have the option of doing both simultaneously, though he cautioned that no decisions had been made.\n\n\u201cI do not foreclose at all other efforts in parallel to make sure we fully find out all the facts, including court,\u201d Schiff said. He noted that if the administration fought these efforts, \u201cthat will not delay us from going forward with articles of impeachment if they are warranted by the president\u2019s obstruction.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe need to protect the country,\" Schiff said. \"We need to expose whatever wrongdoing has gone on. That work is going to have to proceed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchiff noted, crucially, that Democrats could continue to fight for information in court even after the House voted to impeach \u2014 which could potentially lay the groundwork for additional articles later.\n\n\u201cIf it is necessary to go down the road of other articles of impeachment, then presumably there will be a trial in the Senate,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a court in the land that will preclude the Congress from getting the evidence it needs at trial.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need an explicit quid pro quo for this to be impeachable. We already know from the rough White House transcript of Trump\u2019s call that he pressured Zelensky to \u201cinvestigate\u201d Joe Biden, based on an entirely fabricated narrative, and to substantiate a fringe conspiracy theory undercutting our own intelligence services\u2019 documentation of Russian interference in our election on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it\u2019s not hard to see more emerging that does support an explicit link between the military aid and Trump\u2019s demands of Zelensky. And as one GOP pollster conceded to John Harwood, that will make things a lot more uncomfortable for Senate Republicans.\n\nIf more along those lines does emerge, that could increase the pressure on Senate Republicans to hold a real impeachment trial, and make it harder for the more vulnerable among them to defend Trump\u2019s position.\n\nThe public has an obvious appetite to learn more. A lot more. And we are only at the beginning of this process.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump\u2019s latest lies about the Ukraine scandal are imploding fast\n\nMichael Gerson: If Republicans stay loyal to Trump, they\u2019ll be implicated in the moral decay of our politics\n\nDana Milbank: Trump\u2019s defense: You can\u2019t impeach me.
