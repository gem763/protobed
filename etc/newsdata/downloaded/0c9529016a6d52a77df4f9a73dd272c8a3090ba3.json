O\u2019Brien, his main hostage negotiator, as his national security adviser.\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien will replace John R. Bolton, who was ousted last week amid disagreements with key White House aides and Mr. Trump on topics such as Iran, North Korea and Venezuela.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worked with me for quite a while now on hostages, and we have a tremendous track record on hostages,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. O\u2019Brien, who served as U.S. special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.\n\n\u201cRobert has been fantastic. We know each other well,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters during an appearance with Mr. O\u2019Brien in Los Angeles.\n\nMr. O\u2019 Brien called it a \u201cprivilege\u201d to serve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, Mr. O\u2019Brien was named as national security adviser as the president weighs a response to Iran\u2019s alleged role in drone attacks that crippled Saudi oil production over the weekend.\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien will be called into action immediately, as Mr. Trump heads to New York for the U.N. General Assembly next week.\n\n\u201cRobert\u2019s a very experienced foreign policy figure with deep knowledge of United Nations, international organizations,\u201d said Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation, and who worked alongside Mr. O\u2019Brien on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential bid. \u201cI think there will be a lot of U.N.-related work in the coming year on many fronts, not least of which with Iran, North Korea.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien worked under President George W. Bush as a representative to the U.N., continuing in Mr. Bolton\u2019s footsteps as a Trump official with connections to the last GOP administration.\n\nMr. Trump has tired of previous Bush veterans \u2014 beyond Mr. Bolton, there was Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who sparred with Mr. Trump over immigration before her ouster.\n\nStill, Mr. Gardiner said Mr. O\u2019Brien offers solid ground to the president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a safe pair of hands,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who, I think, has very good instincts, and a very good understanding of the challenges facing the United States as leader of the free world.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien endeared himself to Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo by working to secure the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey, Americans held in Afghanistan and Danny Burch, an oil worker held in Yemen for 18 months.\n\nMr. Trump hailed Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s work in a welcome-home ceremony for Mr. Burch in the Oval Office in March.\n\nIn turn, Mr. O\u2019Brien praised Mr. Trump for working to bring home Americans through \u201cforce of will,\u201d without concessions or payments.\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien will be the president\u2019s fourth national security adviser in less than three years.\n\nHis first, Michael Flynn, was an Army lieutenant general and key campaign surrogate for Mr. Trump.\n\nHe was ousted after just weeks on the job for misleading Vice President Mike Pence over contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. He then pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about those contacts as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nHis replacement, H.R. McMaster, lasted for a while but Mr. Trump tired of him by early 2018 and tapped Mr. Bolton instead, though his relationship with Mr. Bolton soured beyond repair this year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
