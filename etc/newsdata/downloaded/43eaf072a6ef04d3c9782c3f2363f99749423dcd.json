The look was identical to that of the runway model from the designer's London Fashion Week show, which took place last week.\n\nHer hair was pulled back, slick and parted in the middle and her chunky diamond studs added just the right amount of sparkle to the ensemble.\n\n71st Emmy Awards - Executive Arrivals Alberto E.
