Between 2015 and 2019 some 51 per cent to 62 per cent of cases were classed as \"investigation completed - no suspect identified.\u201d\n\n\"One of the least likely outcomes nationally is for offenders to be charged of summonsed,\" it added.\n\nBetween April and June, some 40 per cent of calls made to Action Fraud were hung up before they were answered, equating to 20,000 calls about cyber criime and fraud being abandoned each month.\n\nIn March last year the average wait time for a call to Action Fraud to be answered was 16 minutes, according to figures.\n\nMr Parr said this was a \"huge under reported crime\" which is costing the Government \u00a31.1 billion a year. There were 25,000 reports of cyber-dependent crime in 2017/18 and 656,000 IP addresses were known to have been affected but the problem is thought to be far bigger.\n\nHe said there were \"huge inconsistencies\" across the 43 police forces in England and Wales and funding was \"erratic\". \"The basic failing is that there's no national system,\" he added.\n\nThe report recommended a \"central co-coordinating agency\" which decides whether crimes should be investigated by local police forces or a national agency and ensures officers are trained \"to the right standards\".", "description": "Thousands of reports of cyber crime were quarantined on a police database instead of being investigated because software designed to protect the computer system branded them a \"security risk.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Home Affairs Editor", "Rupert Christiansen", "Allister Heath"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/09/TELEMMGLPICT000186662326-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
