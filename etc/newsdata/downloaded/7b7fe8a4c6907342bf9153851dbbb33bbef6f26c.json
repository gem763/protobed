It sounds horrible to me,\" Trump told Zelensky in the call.\n\n'A disgraceful thing'\n\n\n\nThe transcript, which is a summary rather than a word-for-word record, did not show Trump explicitly tying aid to Ukraine to Zelensky probing Biden, which has fed the calls to impeach the US leader.\n\nBut the two did discuss aid, which had been frozen by Trump at the time and was only released in recent weeks.\n\nThe memo also shows Trump asking Zelensky for a \"favor\" on an issue unconnected to Biden -- just after noting that the US had been \"very, very good to Ukraine.\"\n\nDemocratic leader Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of impeachment proceedings Tuesday, alleging that Trump had betrayed his country in seeking Ukraine's help to find dirt on Biden, the leading Democratic candidate for the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe White House was scrambling though to defend Trump, who faces the possibility of becoming the third US president in history to be impeached.\n\nIn New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, Trump branded the impeachment probe the \"single greatest witch hunt in American history... a disgraceful thing.\"\n\nThe White House was stunned when Pelosi, the powerful speaker of the House of Representatives, suddenly abandoned months of resistance and announced the impeachment investigation.\n\nOnly two presidents in US history have been impeached, Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998, deeply tarring both of their legacies.\n\n'Betrayal'\n\nPelosi declared the formal investigation 11 days after the news that an anonymous US intelligence official had filed a formal whistleblower complaint on Trump's alleged double-dealing with Ukraine, tying aid to the country for dirt on Biden.\n\n\"The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable facts of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\" she said.\n\nWith the call transcript not a verbatim record, Democrats made clear its release would not satisfy their investigation into whether the US leader broke the law.\n\nThey demanded the full release of the whistleblower complaint, even as the Justice Department declared that it showed no wrongdoing and said \"no further action was warranted.\"\n\nPelosi had resisted pressure from the party rank-and-file for impeachment, preferring to focus their energies on the presidential and congressional elections next year as the public has shown little taste for a full-blown congressional probe into Trump.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday said that only 37 percent of voters support impeaching Trump while 57 percent oppose, even if more than half disapprove of the US leader's performance.\n\nBut Pelosi said there was now strong evidence of Trump's wrongdoing.\n\n\"No. You *don't* ask foreign governments for help in our elections. That *is not* right,\" she tweeted Wednesday.", "description": "The summary of US President Donald Trump's phone call that shows he discussed his political rival Joe Biden with Ukraine's president is \"deeply troubling\", Republican Senator Mitt Romney says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9397/4648abe767ee4af7b6c2e3ace8dbd23f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
