Bush appointee and former presiding judge of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \u2014 marked the latest turbulence in an investigation that McCabe\u2019s defenders say is a move by the Trump administration to punish the president\u2019s perceived political enemies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt a brief hearing in an open records lawsuit, Walton confirmed McCabe has not been indicted and that the department still is weighing charges.\n\nMcCabe, who became acting FBI director in 2017 after President Trump fired James B. Comey, authorized the bureau to begin investigating Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, and has since become a lightning rod for the political battles surrounding the FBI and the Justice Department. Trump has frequently criticized McCabe while prosecutors have sought to determine whether he should be charged for lying to federal investigators about authorizing other FBI officials in 2016 to talk to a reporter about tensions inside the FBI and Justice Department over the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and a separate review of the Clinton family foundation.\n\nWalton spoke after Justice attorneys argued in private before him for the latest postponement in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit over documents about the FBI\u2019s investigation of McCabe, which the government has declined to release citing potential interference with a law enforcement proceeding.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe case against McCabe grew out of an investigation by the FBI\u2019s inspection division, and the records might reveal the details of that inquiry. McCabe\u2019s legal team has asserted, for example, that two inspection division agents disagreed about the appropriateness of asking certain questions in one conversation with McCabe.\n\n\u201cI would send this message to those in positions of authority in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office and the Justice Department . . . that I will not condone further delay,\u201d Walton said, according to a transcript of the unsealed portion of the hearing.\n\nWalton expressed \u201cdismay\u201d to Justice lawyers that the case \u201cis just dragging too long,\u201d adding: \u201cYou all have got to cut and make your decision. It\u2019s not a hard decision, and I think it needs to be made. If it\u2019s not made, I\u2019m going to start ordering the release of information because I think our society, our public does have a right to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAndrew McCabe, Trump\u2019s foil at the FBI, is fired hours before he can retire\n\nThe legal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, sued in July 2018 to enforce its FOIA request for all government records related to the FBI\u2019s investigation into McCabe, a request CREW filed shortly after McCabe was fired on March 16, 2018.\n\nAn inspector general report made public that April found McCabe had lied four times, three of them under oath to federal investigators, allegedly misleading them about the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information to a reporter about an investigation into Clinton, Trump\u2019s 2016 Democratic opponent.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office referred its findings about McCabe\u2019s alleged false statements to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the District for prosecution. McCabe disputes the allegation, and his legal team said Trump\u2019s attacks against McCabe have \u201cirrevocably tainted\u201d the investigation and made a fair prosecution impossible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcCabe\u2019s legal team says Trump\u2019s attacks have made fair prosecution an \u2018impossibility\u2019\n\nMcCabe was acting FBI director from May to August 2017. In a separate lawsuit, McCabe alleges the department fired him as part of a purge of individuals not politically loyal to Trump.\n\nAt Monday\u2019s hearing in Washington, Anne L. Weismann, chief FOIA counsel for CREW, said McCabe\u2019s lawsuit \u201creveals exactly what we had feared,\u201d by alleging the inspector general kept exculpatory evidence from the FBI out of its report. She also cited reports that although Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen has decided to charge McCabe, a grand jury recalled last month to indict him left with no sign of an indictment being returned.\n\nJustice Dept. won\u2019t answer whether grand jury turned down indictment of McCabe, his lawyers say\n\nWeismann, a Justice Department attorney from 1981 to 2002 and former supervisor of government records litigation, argued against allowing further delays based on what she said looks like some \u201cmad effort to find some way to indict Mr. McCabe to appease the president,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s more critical than ever that the public have information. We need to be able to restore our faith in the law enforcement community, in the FBI.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWeismann appeared to strike a chord with Walton by saying: \u201cWe\u2019re in dark times where there\u2019s growing evidence that the president aided by the attorney general is using the power of his office to go after perceived political enemies. He\u2019s going after the intelligence community. He\u2019s going after the law enforcement community . . . \u201d\n\n\u201cGoing after the courts, too,\u201d Walton interjected.\n\n\u201cAnd he [Trump] is going after the courts, the press,\u201d Weismann continued.\n\n\u201cI totally appreciate what you just said and share many of the same concerns,\u201d responded Walton, a former senior official in the D.C. U.S. attorney\u2019s office and defense attorney.\n\nAndrew McCabe\u2019s legal team asks Justice Dept. if grand jury rejected charges in his case\n\nWalton, however, said he had no choice but to agree to one more extension to Nov. 15 \u2014 shorter than the government requested. Walton gave no explanation but spoke after the hearing in a sealed session from Justice Department attorneys Justin Sandberg with the civil division, Madeleine Hensler from the Office of the Inspector General, and J.P. Cooney, chief of the fraud and public corruption unit of the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District, which is overseeing the McCabe investigation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWalton said: \u201cThis matter is a high-profile matter. And I think it does, while the matter hangs in limbo, it does undermine the credibility, not only of the Justice Department because it\u2019s not making these hard decisions, but also the court, because Congress enacted this [open records] legislation for the purpose of the American public being made aware of what its government is doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the government will have to make a call,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to start ordering the release of information on the next occasion.\u201d\n\nJustice Dept. won\u2019t answer whether grand jury turned down indictment of McCabe, his lawyers say\n\nMcCabe\u2019s legal team says Trump\u2019s attacks have made fair prosecution an \u2018impossibility\u2019\n\nAndrew McCabe\u2019s legal team asks Justice Dept. if grand jury rejected charges in his case\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Judge says further delay undermines the credibility of the Justice Department and courts amid concerns that President Trump is \u201cgoing after\u201d political enemies.", "authors": ["Spencer S.
