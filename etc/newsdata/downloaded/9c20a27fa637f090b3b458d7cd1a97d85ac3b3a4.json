Yet, it\u2019s clear there was nothing impeachable in President Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. Those who are doubtful can read the transcript for themselves.\n\nSecond, the Democrats, liberals and mainstream media have consistently colluded with each other in trying to remove Mr. Trump from office since he was elected. It hasn\u2019t stopped since 2016 and it\u2019s nefarious. There was the lengthy and intensive Mueller investigation that resulted in no evidence of collusion with Russia. Then there was (and remains) the incessant labeling of everything Mr. Trump does as \u201cracist\u201d and/or \u201cdistorted.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s major accomplishments for the good of America are being totally ignored as the left generates continuous fabricated assaults.\n\nNow consider the Obama scandals: The \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun-running operation; Benghazi lies and subsequent cover-up; IRS targeting of conservative organizations; the Justice Department\u2019s seizure of Associated Press records; NSA mass surveillance against American citizens without warrants; NSA\u2019s spying on Congress by eavesdropping on private conversations between American lawmakers and Israeli representatives; and the $1.7 billion given to Iran to supposedly settle a failed arms deal. Not once was \u201cimpeachment\u201d uttered by the Democrats against President Obama over these very real acts of malfeasance.\n\nMr. Trump shouldn\u2019t be impeached. There are no grounds for it whatsoever.\n\nMICHAEL IMHOF\n\nAurora, Ill.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
