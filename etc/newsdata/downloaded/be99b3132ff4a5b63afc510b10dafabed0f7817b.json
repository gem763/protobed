The 49ers host Cleveland on Monday night.\n\nThe Chiefs (4-1) had scored at least 26 points in 27 consecutive regular-season games, the longest streak in NFL history. But the run ended with a lackluster effort against the Colts (3-2), who dominated the line of scrimmage.\n\nMarlon Mack had 132 yards rushing, finding holes against a defense that lost tackles Chris Jones and Xavier Williams to injuries.\n\nThe Colts were equally impressive against reigning league MVP Patrick Mahomes. They spent most of the night in Kansas City's backfield, stuffing the ground game and putting constant pressure on Mahomes. He was sacked four times, hit more often, and spent the final few minutes hobbling around Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n\"We got beat in about every phase you can get beat this evening,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.\n\nMahomes finished with 321 yards passing and a touchdown.\n\nThe Chiefs will try to regroup next week against Houston (3-2), which scored 53 points \u2014 the second-most in franchise history \u2014 in a victory against Atlanta (1-4).\n\nHere are some other things that happened during Week 5 of the NFL season:\n\nSTILL WINLESS\n\nFour teams remain without a victory: Cincinnati (0-5), Washington (0-5), Miami (0-4) and the New York Jets (0-4). At least one of them should snap out of their early season slump next week because the Dolphins host the Redskins.\n\nFor now, though, it's the NFL's most winless teams through Week 5 in a decade. Kansas City, St. Louis, Tampa Bay and Tennessee were winless after five weeks in 2009. Each of them ended its drought in the next three games.\n\nThe Bengals got the closest to winning Sunday, scoring two touchdowns in a little more than 2 minutes against Arizona and tying the game at 23. But rookie Kyler Murray drove the Cardinals into position for the game-winning field goal on the final play.\n\nCincy's problem was evident: It allowed 514 yards.\n\nWashington and the Jets were downright dismal on offense. The Redskins scored on their second possession against New England, getting a 65-yard run from receiver Cam Sims, but did little else . The Redskins finished with 220 yards and two turnovers.\n\nThe Jets would have loved that kind of outburst considering they managed 128 yards at Philadelphia.\n\nANOTHER INJURED QB\n\nPittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph left the game against Baltimore because of a concussion caused by safety Earl Thomas' hit to the chin.\n\nTrailing 17-13 in the third quarter, Rudolph scrambled to his left, stepped up the field and flicked the ball to teammate James Washington just before the crown of Thomas' helmet hit Rudolph under the chin. Rudolph limply fell to the ground and laid there with his eyes closed while medical personnel rushed to his side. Rudolph woozily made his way off the field and to a nearby hospital for further evaluation.\n\nHe was the second Steelers quarterback hurt this season. Starter Ben Roethlisberger is out for the year following elbow surgery.\n\nCarolina, Chicago, Jacksonville, New Orleans and the New York Jets also are without their starting quarterback because of injury.\n\nPATRIOTS ROLL\n\nTom Brady passed Brett Favre for third place on the NFL's all-time passing list with 71,923 yards. Brady now trails only retired Peyton Manning (71,940) and injured New Orleans star Drew Brees (74,845). Brady also edged closer to Manning's record 539 touchdown passes with the 527th of his 20-year career.\n\nNew England's defense has been even better than its 42-year-old icon.\n\nThe Pats are allowing 6.8 points a game, better than two defenses widely considered the best in NFL history.\n\nThe 1985 Chicago Bears allowed 12.4 points a game, and the 2000 Baltimore Ravens surrendered 10.3 points a game.\n\nNEWSY NUGGETS\n\nMahomes reached 7,000 yards passing in just the 22nd game of his NFL career, becoming the fastest player to reach that milestone in the Super Bowl era. He topped the previous mark by Hall of Famer Kurt Warner (25 games). ... Dallas' Amari Cooper notched his third game with at least 200 yards receiving. Only Calvin Johnson (5) and Jerry Rice (4) have more in the Super Bowl era. ... The Jets have more defensive/special teams touchdowns (3) than offensive touchdowns (2) this season. ... Houston's Deshaun Watson posted a perfect passer rating (158.3) thanks to having the same number of passing touchdowns (5) as incompletions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
