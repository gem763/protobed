Previously, the Prime shopper would have had to add low-cost items such as deodorants or toothpaste, for example, via its \"add-on\" tool, which enables these items to be shipped for free when you spend a minimum of $25.\n\nOn its site, Amazon explains that it offers the Add-on service to allow it to \"offer thousands of low-priced items that would be cost-prohibitive to ship on their own.\"\n\nAccording to a September report from analysts at Edgewater Research, which was cited by Recode, Amazon has \"essentially turned off\" this add-on feature in the past few months. Now, many consumer packaged goods \u2014 items like deodorant or toothpaste \u2014 will be available for free shipping when they purchase them alone.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. In a statement to Recode, a spokesperson said: \"We know customers love our vast selection, low prices, and free one-day delivery with Prime and we are always innovating to improve their experience.\"\n\nThe news should terrify Amazon's competitors such as Target, CVS, or Walgreens \u2014 companies running brick-and-mortar stores where shoppers might otherwise go to pick up low-cost items on short notice. If these are items are now available to buy online and have shipped to your home the next day, they'll have fewer reasons to visit the store.\n\nBut Amazon's moves into this market should raise red flags from an antitrust perspective, experts say.\n\n\"There's no way that shipping costs are less than 75 cents, and there's no way any other company that wants to sell a makeup brush could deliver that for free. It's not possible and it highlights how pricing strategies can be used to drive rivals from the market. But antitrust law currently misses this anticompetitive conduct with its obsession on low prices,\" Sally Hubbard, an antitrust expert, told Recode.\n\nRead more: More than 1,500 Amazon employees are expected to walk out on Friday to protest climate change\n\nAnd as Recode writer Jason Del Rey points out, the free shipping of smaller items is likely to cause issues with environmental activists who already urging the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030.", "description": "According to Recode, Amazon is making it possible for Prime members to shop for low-cost items and have these shipped for free the next day.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da45dad4af9091439481773?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
