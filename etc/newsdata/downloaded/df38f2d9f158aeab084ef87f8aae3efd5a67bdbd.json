Now, A Massive Cookout With Many Pounds Of Animal Flesh Will Be Grilled In Response\n\nIt must be said that vegans are the terrorists of the food world. They\u2019re Hezbollah. Period. In Australia, one vegan, Cilla Carden, was so triggered by her neighbor\u2019s grilling habits that she brought a lawsuit against him. This is 'first world problems' to the extreme. She apparently couldn\u2019t enjoy being out in her garden because of the roasting smell of BBQ. Fish was also grilled. Needless to say, this all sounds delicious. For Carden, it was probably hell of earth, but who cares? Seriously, we\u2019re going to go after people for their eating habits\u2014and one that\u2019s shared by millions. People like burgers. People like barbeque. We\u2019re not going to kowtow to these people and the Australian courts agreed. They rejected her case and her appeal. Oh, yeah\u2014she tried to get the Australian Supreme Court to weigh in on this nonsense (via Nine News):\n\nA Perth vegan has taken her neighbours all the way to the Supreme Court, demanding they stop smoking, bouncing balls and even cooking barbecues in the backyard. Cilla Carden, from Girrawheen, in Perth's northern suburbs said she's fed up with the smell of meat cooking on the barbecue next door. \"They've put it there so I smell fish, all I can smell is fish. I can't enjoy my backyard, I can't go out there.\" [\u2026] But a Supreme Court Judge and the State Administrative Tribunal have sided with her neighbours, dismissing her case. Her request to appeal the decisions has also been refused.\n\nCarden started it. And now, thousands plan to attend a community BBQ in her honor, where many pounds of dead animal flesh will be grilled to perfection. This is the best response possible. Carden knows about it as well and she\u2019s not pleased. Some 14,000 people are said to be attending this Facebook event. It probably won\u2019t come close to that, but in solidarity\u2014we should all BBQ for Carden wherever you may be (via Fox29):", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:09:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2011/41/a15471b8-5024-4ecc-9ee0-e3a3185a7627@news.ap.org.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
