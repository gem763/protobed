We didn\u2019t actually see what caused the explosion, remember.\n\nOther than the message The Accident aims to send about class, forgotten communities and corporate responsibility, it is yet another vehicle for Lancashire to prove why she is one of the best British actors around today.\n\nShe insisted at the launch that she didn\u2019t want to be seen as the \u2018queen of gritty drama\u2019, but between this, Happy Valley and Kiri she has the title sewn up. Few actors can truly play an \u2018every man\u2019 character convincingly \u2013 their star power blanketing everything \u2013 but she totally disappeared behind Polly\u2019s oversized outfits and the pretty spot-on Welsh accent that took six months to perfect.\n\nA special mention also has to go to Joanna Scanlan as Angela, delivering a fireball of a performance that\u2019s both deeply tragic and hilarious (in an upcoming episode she muses about a possible cover up: \u2018Someone\u2019s f****d\u2019 someone, and no one can find the d**k\u2019).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Accident is hard-going, from the subject matter to the dark domestic abuse storyline, so we don\u2019t recommend you watch in one sitting, but Thorne has insisted there are \u2018shafts of light\u2019 injected into the series throughout.\n\nAnd with the Grenfell disaster mostly left by the wayside by the media and politicians alike with no one held accountable (yet), The Accident is a much needed high-intensity beam.\n\nThe Accident airs Thursdays at 9pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
