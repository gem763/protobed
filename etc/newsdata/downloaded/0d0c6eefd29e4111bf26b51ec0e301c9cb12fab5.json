The England team are pictured following their loss to the Czech Republic\n\nBy comparison, supporting the winning side is linked to a 20 per cent lower chance of a fatal incident.\n\nBecause the downsides of losing outweigh the positive effects of winning, spectators are on balance six per cent more likely to suffer a deadly heart-related event on match day.\n\nMen appear more vulnerable, with their chance of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events increasing more steeply on football days than women.\n\nThe scientists thought it could be because men tended to care more about football.\n\nTheir research, outlined in the Journal of Sports Sciences, concluded: 'Cardiovascular events are triggered by great mental stress and emotional upheaval in relation to soccer matches'.\n\nDistraught: Experts say the knock-on effect of men caring so much about football, including stars such as England captain Harry Kane (pictured), leads to their health woes\n\nThey also suggested 'increased alcohol and tobacco consumption to relieve upset feelings' might be a factor, and said 'precautionary measures' were needed at matches.\n\nAlex Roberts, of sport publisher joe.co.uk, said: 'Anyone who's seen their team concede a 90th-minute winner knows how stressful football can be.\n\n'But it's worth remembering that it's only a game.'", "description": "Health experts are warning football fans can damage their hearts by watching the beloved beautiful game.
