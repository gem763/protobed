And later, after the kids were asleep, when I told Brett I felt angry about the empty threat, I felt angrier still that he looked up from his laptop to ask, \u201cWhy are you giving me such a hard time right now?\u201d\n\nLike so many women, so many mothers, I have plenty to be angry about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBooks such as Rebecca Traister\u2019s \u201cGood and Mad,\u201d Brittney Cooper\u2019s \u201cEloquent Rage\u201d and Darcy Lockman\u2019s \u201cAll the Rage\u201d have gained recent traction among readers thirsty to see their anger on the page. The fact that books devoted to female rage keep being written shows that our rage is not simple or universal; it cannot be reduced to a few pithy truths.\n\nWhere do black mothers go to cry?\n\n\u201cBurn It Down: Women Writing About Anger\u201d is one of the most recent of such books, and perhaps what makes it stand out from its predecessors is its very dedication to this rich variety of female rage. The essay collection also shines as a result of editor Lilly Dancyger\u2019s insistence that anger can be instructive, anger can incite political change and anger can be harnessed, but anger must first be seen and heard. As women, Dancyger notes, \u201cour anger doesn\u2019t have to be useful to deserve a voice.\u201d\n\nThe authors featured in the collection write about rape culture, racism, illness, abuse, gender identity and family. In many essays, women grapple with rage both as mothers and as daughters. A recurring theme is that of inherited rage, how the familial rage we witness as children affects us as mothers to a new generation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLisa Factora-Borchers writes about confronting constant racism as a Filipina American child in predominantly white rural Ohio, and later, how the 2016 presidential election affected her experience raising her own children in Ohio. She considers how inherited anger will affect her children, how she will teach them to \u201ctransform caustic racist experiences into an arsenal for protection and healing.\u201d\n\nIn writing about the abuse she experienced from her father as a child, Marisa Siegel is determined to ensconce her own son in love and security, while still allowing space for him to work through anger so he doesn\u2019t grow up \u201csteeped in rage.\u201d Siegel\u2019s deliberate turning away from her father\u2019s anger shows that although rage can be passed down, the cycle of rage can also be stopped.\n\nWhen I feel the center of my chest burn hot, I think of my mother\u2019s anger, which always rose so quickly when I was a kid. I remember her whipping a vacuum cleaner down the stairs, her face all right angles, and I wonder how much of my rage has been born from hers. I didn\u2019t understand her anger then, but now my burning chest makes me certain that she had plenty of reasons to clench her teeth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDani Boss finds her anger difficult to access because she was \u201ctaught to be a good girl,\u201d causing her rage to become \u201cwarped.\u201d When Boss\u2019s stepdaughter offers to help clean the kitchen, the child expresses annoyance that her brothers aren\u2019t doing the same, and Boss urges her to speak up, saying, \u201cHer anger doesn\u2019t have to hide in the pantry.\u201d In this way, Boss does for her stepdaughter what was not done for her as a young girl \u2014 she not only validates her anger but also encourages her to express it.\n\nOne of the things that makes female rage so historically painful for many of us is the fact that we find this release difficult, because we have been taught, as Nina St. Pierre says, to \u201cswallow it.\u201d St. Pierre views this as something girls are trained to do: \"Trained not to rage, we work in code, our bodies the medium. We eat anger and quietly metabolize it to keep you comfortable.\u201d\n\nWhen my male dermatologist commented on the aesthetics of my post-baby stomach during a full body exam in which I wore nothing but a paper crop top, I swallowed my rage. I did it to keep him comfortable, when I was anything but. Later on, my rage sat like a rock in my stomach when I considered my daughter and how my silence at his office worked to uphold a broken system in which the male dermatologist\u2019s comfort seemed somehow more important than my own.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nForced to stop teaching and hide beneath a desk when a gunman is reported on campus, Megan Stielstra feels not fear, but rage: \u201cI was white-hot and clenched, my muscles seething. Psychologists have long written about anger as a secondary emotion to fear, but I could give a s--- about theory. This was gut-level; my body, my bones.\u201d Stielstra\u2019s fury is compounded by the fact that her 10-year-old son experiences the same lockdown at his elementary school, by the fact that he will forever carry the trauma of the experiences within him. Stielstra\u2019s maternal rage is righteous, logical and just. Although angry women are often demeaned as raving, hysterical, unhinged, Stielstra\u2019s moment hunched under a desk is a moment in which angry is the only reasonable thing to be.\n\nI feel angry often. I\u2019m angry that our kids call for me first if both my husband and I are in the same room. I\u2019m angry that my desire to give the best of myself to my kids\u2019 fights against my desire to give the best of myself to my work. I\u2019m angry that my husband doesn\u2019t feel this same warring of selves. I\u2019m angry that doulas aren\u2019t paid for by insurance. I\u2019m angry that any woman sobs alone and unsupported as she battles postpartum depression. I\u2019m angry that women are forced to work while still bleeding from childbirth. I\u2019m angry that mothers are being torn from their children at the border. I\u2019m angry that child care is unaffordable for many. I\u2019m angry about the shameful mortality rate of black mothers. I\u2019m angry about our nation\u2019s laughable stance on family leave. I\u2019m angry that we\u2019re even talking about birth control. I\u2019m angry that my daughter sees a conventionally beautiful woman on a magazine cover and says, \u201cI want to look like that.\u201d\n\nAnd because there\u2019s so much to be angry about, often this anger makes me feel hopeless. Helpless. Exhausted. Deeply sad. In her essay that examines the problematic and limiting archetypes of both the sad woman and the angry woman, Leslie Jamison writes about her hopes for the future: \u201cI don\u2019t hope that my daughter never gets angry. I hope that she lives in a world that can recognize the ways anger and sadness live together, and the ways rage and responsibility, so often seen as natural enemies, can live together as well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJamison\u2019s point is crucial. Our anger needn\u2019t flatten us; rather, anger is a natural part of growth. And as mothers, we must stop swallowing our anger, we must give oxygen to it, not because it is necessarily comfortable, but because our anger is powerful in its very existence. This, for me, is what \u201cBurn it Down\u201d does so well \u2014 this book doesn\u2019t splash water onto female rage, it stands back in awe at the immensity of the flames.\n\nSara Petersen is a writer, whose writes essays about feminism and motherhood.
