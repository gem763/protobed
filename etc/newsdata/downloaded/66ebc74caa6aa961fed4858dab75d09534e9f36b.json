That came in his rookie year in 2012 before he emerged in 2013 as one of the more talented players in the game at his position.\n\nHowever, multiple suspensions from the league have limited his career, including two full missed seasons and several other shortened ones. He also faced an indefinite suspension this past offseason but was reinstated before the start of the regular season.\n\nThe 28-year-old struggled with injuries, including knee and ankle problems in 2019.\n\nHe has been a quality player when healthy, although there have been inconsistent results this season. He entered Week 8 with 20 catches for 287 yards and one touchdown.\n\nThough his talent is undeniable, Gordon's inability to stay on the field remains an issue.\n\nMeanwhile, New England will have to turn to its other options at the position, which include Julian Edelman, Phillip Dorsett and the recently acquired Mohamed Sanu.", "description": "New England Patriots  receiver  Josh Gordon  will miss the remainder of the 2019  NFL  season due to a knee injury, per ESPN's  Field Yates .
