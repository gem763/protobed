I am a supporter of Arsenal Football Club so I just support [Emery] and hope that he can win games and plays a type of game that I like,\u2019 said Wenger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think a club like Arsenal is a huge responsibility and one of those responsibilities is to play attractive football.\n\n\u2018After that, I think the most important thing is to support the team, the club and win games.\u2019\n\nArsenal are just a point behind champions Manchester City but Wenger doubts his former side have enough to mount a title challenge this term.\n\nInstead, the Frenchman believes Liverpool will end their long wait for the Premier League.\n\n\u2018At the moment you don\u2019t look too much at the position because the points difference is very small with anybody else,\u2019 Wenger told SPORF.\n\n\u2018You draw, you\u2019re 7th. You win a game, you\u2019re 3rd.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think [Arsenal can challenge for the title] at the moment on what I\u2019ve seen. Liverpool is too far ahead for everybody else.\n\n\u2018Man City looks to me to have the best potential to fight against Liverpool, but as long as long you\u2019re not too far away you can hope.\u2019\n\nMORE: Leicester star James Maddison reserves special praise for Premier League midfield rivals Jorginho and Harry Winks", "description": "Arsene Wenger has reminded Unai Emery of Arsenal's 'huge responsibility' to play 'attractive' football following the club's start to the season.
