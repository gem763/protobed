Here\u2019s How It Could Happen.", "language": "en", "text": "Within a month, Brexit will either have happened, or it will have been delayed yet again.\n\nIt has now been over three years since the British people voted to leave the European Union, and the relentless delays imposed by the British courts, the Parliament, and the EU itself have been maddening.\n\nBut the past three days that I spent at the British Conservative Party conference in Manchester proved that the strength of feeling behind Brexit hasn\u2019t waned in the slightest. The motto of the conference was \u201cGet Brexit Done,\u201d and everyone I spoke with agreed that Brexit was the top priority.\n\nThe reason for this\u2014apart from the fact that it\u2019s the right thing to do, and that the British people voted for it\u2014is simple.\n\nFor three years, Brexit has been the star at the center of the British political system. It\u2019s pulled everything else into orbit around it, and blinded the political system to many other issues.\n\nIf the Conservative Party plans to remain in power, it can\u2019t dispense with Brexit. The threat from Nigel Farage\u2019s rival Brexit Party makes that clear.\n\nBut Conservatives can\u2019t remain stuck on Brexit either. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been clear: Getting Brexit done is not just the right thing do, it\u2019s also the gateway back to normal politics, where Conservatives can focus on core issues like education and crime.\n\nTactically, Johnson\u2019s position is weak. His government is 41 seats shy of a majority, meaning that in normal circumstances, he wouldn\u2019t be prime minister at all. He only remains in power because his opponents can\u2019t agree to form a government.\n\nHe can\u2019t call an election\u2014Parliament has defeated his efforts to do so. And by passing a foolish act requiring him to keep on negotiating with the EU, Parliament has tied his hands.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, that the EU will get tired of this charade and wrap up talks before the end of October, allowing Britain to exit on the projected date of Oct. 31. But this is a perilous bet at best.\n\nThe EU didn\u2019t become what it is today by giving Britain a good deal on anything.\n\nDespite those setbacks, politically, Johnson\u2019s position is excellent. He has a good lead in the polls and is likely\u2014though hardly certain\u2014to win an election when one comes.\n\nHis main opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, leads a Labour Party that has just decided it wants to nationalize all private schools. Policies like that are why Labour is polling as badly as it ever has.\n\nMore importantly, the arguments over Brexit itself have ended. Britain wants out of the EU.\n\nMake no mistake, Brexit still has opponents, including most of the political establishment. But they\u2019ve stopped trying to win the argument against Brexit on its merits, for the simple reason that none of their arguments have changed the minds of the Brexiteers.\n\nThe only thing left in their arsenal is to force procedural delays\u2014and that\u2019s what the past six months have amounted to: an effort to run out the clock on Brexit.\n\nBut delaying is not a strategy; it\u2019s a way of searching for one roadblock after another to postpone the inevitable.\n\nThere are many ways to get to Brexit. Parliament could vote to hold an election, the winners of which would be given the mandate to lead Britain out of the EU. Alternatively, the government may find a way out of the legal confines Parliament has created to tie its hands.\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s speech to the conference Wednesday, a deal between Britain and the EU might actually happen. Or the EU might simply decide not to extend Britain\u2019s negotiating time and kick it out of the club.\n\nBy contrast, there are only two ways for Brexit to fail: Its opponents keep on delaying six months at a time\u2014forever\u2014or they fight and win a second referendum or an election.\n\nEither way, they cannot win the argument, and that means Brexit will stay on the agenda no matter how long it\u2019s delayed.\n\nRight now, the likeliest path to Brexit is through an election, which is why Johnson is calling for one and is putting the Conservative Party on election footing. The message discipline of his ministers at this conference was impressive, as was the supportive turnout at all the panels on Brexit.\n\nThe mood at the conference wasn\u2019t nervous, it was expectant. Big things are coming in British politics. No one knows how Brexit will arrive\u2014a point that virtually everyone I spoke with emphasized\u2014but the British Conservative Party remains confident that it will get to an election, and get to Brexit.\n\nFor the sake of Britain\u2019s Conservatives and British democracy, that confidence needs to be vindicated.", "description": "Within a month, Brexit will either have happened, or it will have been delayed yet again.\u00a0\n\nIt has now been over three years since the British people voted to leave the European Union, and the relentless delays imposed by the British courts, the Parliament, and the EU itself have been maddening.", "authors": ["Theodore R.
