Recommendations are separate from any business incentives.\n\nEcho smart speakers are everywhere. If you don\u2019t own one yourself, chances are good that you\u2019ve run across the puck-shaped Dot, the taller Echo Plus, or the video-centric Echo Show on a friend\u2019s coffee table. But there\u2019s one product in Amazon\u2019s Echo line that tends to hide behind closed doors, and it could turn out to be your best friend when it comes to refreshing your wardrobe for fall.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Look has been around since mid-2018, but it hasn\u2019t yet caught on like the rest of the lineup, possibly because its primary function has very specific appeal\u2014it's a fashion advisor powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Look does have some unique capabilities, though, and it can do some really cool stuff that other digital assistants can\u2019t.\n\nIts speaker is terrible, so it\u2019s not a good choice if you want to use it to stream music, but with Alexa built in, it can tell you about the weather and do most things other Echo smart speakers can do. The Look does have some unique capabilities, though, and it can do some really cool stuff that other digital assistants can\u2019t. Here\u2019s what sets the Look apart in a market full of smart speakers, and how you can make the most of it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHow the Amazon Echo Look works\n\nThe Echo Look is a small camera that should be placed at shoulder level in the room where you\u2019ll be trying on your outfits. When you\u2019re ready, just say, \u201cAlexa, take a photo.\u201d The Look comes to life and beeps three times before the shutter sound indicates it\u2019s taken the picture. The Look doesn\u2019t have a display, so you\u2019ll need to open the Echo Look app on your smartphone to see the photo and get the stylist\u2019s opinion. The app is where the Look\u2019s magic happens, and you might be surprised at all it can do.\n\nWhat the Amazon Echo Look can do\n\nFind more clothes you\u2019ll love\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Sarah Kovac The Echo Look app can recommend pieces that will match clothes you already love, and it gives links to buy them on Amazon.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for the hottest fall trends, a little black dress for date night, the perfect skinny jeans to pair with a long sweater, or some opaque tights to live in all winter, the Look can help you out. This product is made by Amazon, so it will come as no surprise that it also makes it easy to buy stuff. Try on an outfit, have the Look snap a photo, and the Look app can help you find more clothes that will complement the pieces you already love. It offers pairing suggestions and links directly to the product pages on Amazon.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShare great full-body selfies\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Sarah Kovac The Echo Look takes effortless full-body selfies.\n\nIf you find yourself taking a lot of selfies in your bathroom\u2019s full body mirror, the Look will blow your mind. It sits at shoulder level on a dresser or shelf, and when it hears you say, \u201cAlexa, take a photo,\u201c it snaps a picture of you, crops to center you, and blurs the background to keep the focus on what you\u2019re wearing instead of that drawer you accidentally left open. A perfectly shareable shot of your outfit from head to toe with one simple command.\n\nSee your outfit from every angle\n\nCraning my neck to see the back of my outfit in the mirror is a frequent occurrence in my house. But even if I can manage to get a good look, I\u2019m still not super sure how my clothes might shift as I walk or whether my top digs in at the wrong places when I sit. That\u2019s where the Look\u2019s video recording feature really comes in handy. It can record a six-second video of you walking, sitting, bending over, whatever you need to see, and then it sends the video to the Look app on your phone so you can decide whether or not you need to head back to the closet for a second option.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPick the best outfit\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Sarah Kovac Echo Look's Style Checks are great for deciding between two outfits.\n\nOne of my favorite features was the Echo Look\u2019s Style Check. It takes two outfits you\u2019ve photographed and gives you a side-by-side comparison. The Style Check algorithm takes into account factors like the shape of the outfit on your body, shoe shape, and whether the colors look good on your skin; then it chooses the better outfit on you. While it gives reasons why it picked one outfit over the other, the advice isn\u2019t specific enough to really teach you much.\n\nSome feedback I\u2019ve gotten from Style Checks: \u201c[These] colors are more flattering on you.\u201d \u201cShoe choice works better.\u201d \u201cThe combination of pieces is more flattering.\u201d It\u2019s a fun feature, to be sure, and more than once I\u2019ve looked back through previous Style Checks to be reminded of an outfit I forgot was hiding in the back of my closet.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGet the Echo Look from Amazon for $99.99\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
