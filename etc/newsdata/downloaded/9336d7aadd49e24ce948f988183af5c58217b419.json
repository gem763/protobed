It takes courage, and I am truly grateful.\u201d\n\nHer Twitter post remained public as of Wednesday evening but her Instagram account was set to private.\n\nAfter the Variety story broke overnight, Lauer\u2019s former \u201cToday\u201d co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb voiced their support for Nevils on Wednesday morning\u2019s show.\n\n\"This is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it,\" Guthrie said. \"I know it wasn\u2019t easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then. It is not easy now, and we support her and any women who come forward with claims. And it is just very painful. For all of us at NBC who are at the 'Today' show, it is very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nLauer, who left the public spotlight since his dismissal, denied Wednesday that the encounter described in Farrow\u2019s new book was rape. He admitted to having an extramarital affair with Nevils but said their relationship was completely consensual.\n\nIn a lengthy letter obtain by Fox News, Lauer said that in the hotel room in Sochi, \u201cBrooke did not do or say anything to object.

Lauer said in his letter that he already admitted to the encounter to NBC management but was at not point notified that Nevils categorized it as rape. He also said that his public silence since his firing had been a mistake.\n\nAfter the alleged rape, Nevils described the relationship as \u201ccompletely transactional\u201d and told Farrow she feared Lauer\u2019s potential influence over her career. Lauer pushed back, writing that though they worked for the same company, they worked in completely separate departments and he never was in a position to review her work.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHe also accused Nevils of stepping forward nearly two years after he was fired in an effort to bolster publicity in order to sell Farrow\u2019s new book. Nevils reportedly received a seven-figure settlement from NBC back in 2017 and her name was kept out of the news until Wednesday.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood and Liam Quinn contributed to this report.", "description": "A former NBC News employee whose rape allegation against Matt Lauer went public for the first time Wednesday posted a Twitter message later in the day, thanking those who supported her decision to come forward with her story.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace", "Brooke Nevils", "Accuses Matt Lauer Of Rape", "Matt Lauer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/matt-lauer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
