(Picture: HBO)\n\n\u2018I can manipulate material with my mind,\u2019 Will admitted. \u2018Maybe I\u2019m Doctor Manhattan.\u2019\n\nPushing his case further, Will continued: \u2018He can make copies of himself, he can be in two places at the same time, he can grow 200ft tall, change the colour of my skin.\u2019\n\nAngela doubted that Will was being truthful over her colleague\u2019s death, what with him being 105-years-old and wheelchair-bound and so were we\u2026 to begin with.\n\nWill continued to talk in riddles as the episode progressed, but in the closing scenes when Angela arrested him and went to take him into the station, something super weird happened.\n\nAs the Will was left alone in the car, for literally a split second, a giant magnet appeared, picking up the vehicle and flying it away.\n\nImmediately after he disappeared, a letter fell from the sky, reading: \u2018Watch over this boy.\u2019\n\nIs Will really Doctor Manhattan after all?\n\nWhy is Adrian Veidt cloning his servants?\n\nWe had a lot of questions when we first met Adrian Veidt (Jeremy Irons) last week and it seems they\u2019re just going to keep on coming.\n\nWe have questions\u2026 (Picture: HBO)\n\nThis time around we saw the wealthy mad scientist order his servants to perform a play after he\u2019d celebrated another anniversary by being presented with another cake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe performance ended with one of Adrian\u2019s subjects, John, being burnt to a crisp after being torched in a chamber, but all seemed okay in the end as he reappeared as \u2018Doctor Manhattan\u2019.\n\n\u2018I am both John and not John,\u2019 the cloned John said as he arrived on stage completely nude and painted blue.\n\n\u2018I am the past, present, and the future all at once. Boundless omniscient incarnate swirling in the luminous plasma of a newborn star.\u2019\n\nWhy\u2019s Adrian cloning his subjects and how is this going to tie in with the main story?\n\nWatchmen is available to stream on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic and NOW TV in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
