Obviously any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the United Kingdom and the whole of the European Union.\n\n\u201cLet me add also that it is high time to turn good intentions into a legal text.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, after meeting the European Council\u2019s president-elect Charles Michel, Finland\u2019s Antti Rinne said there was \u201cno time\u201d for the UK Prime Minister to achieve an agreement.\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick rejected the remarks, stressing a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of progress had been made and negotiators are working \u201cvery intensively\u201d.\n\nHe told BBC\u2019s Newsnight: \u201cThe EU is capable of moving extremely quickly if they wish to. Like any negotiation with the EU, and in fact with any major negotiation in life, everything happens at the last minute.\n\n\u201cThis was always going to be both complicated and come down to the final hours and days, so this doesn\u2019t surprise me. We are going to work round the clock to try to secure it.\u201d\n\nEnvironment minister Zac Goldsmith was asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme if he would be prepared to accept a short technical extension to seal a Brexit deal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an extension is necessary. If both sides wish to secure a deal, a deal can be secured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of political will. Where there\u2019s a will there is a way, and that has never been more true than in the case of Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe latest comments comments came as negotiators stepped up efforts to work out a way to break the deadlock over the Irish backstop, the contingency measure to prevent a hard border on the island.\n\nA Cabinet briefing on Brexit has been postponed by Mr Johnson as negotiators continue talks to hammer out a new deal ahead of the October 31 deadline.\n\nTuesday\u2019s planned update to senior ministers was said to have been delayed until Wednesday so he can give more detailed information on efforts to strike a new agreement.\n\nThe PM has been under increasing pressure to concede greater ground to Brussels, with reports suggesting the UK has dropped a demand that a deal should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly on customs arrangements.\n\nSimon Coveney (Rebecca Black/PA)\n\nIrish deputy premier Simon Coveney raised some hopes by saying \u201ca deal is possible\u201d, maybe even this week, but stressed \u201cwe\u2019re not there yet\u201d.\n\nIn similar comments, Mr Johnson told senior ministers there was \u201cstill a significant amount of work to get there\u201d but a \u201cpathway\u201d to a deal was still visible.\n\nThe two-day EU summit is crucial because the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid a clash over asking for a Brexit delay.\n\nThe Benn Act passed by MPs opposed to a no deal, including Tory rebels, says he must ask for an extension to Article 50 if MPs do not back a deal by then.\n\nThere are fears that a loophole could be used to avoid this, with the PM repeatedly ruling out making the extension request under his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to get Brexit done by the Halloween deadline.\n\nLeader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has suggested the Government could use European law to achieve no deal.\n\n\u201cTheresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK,\u201d he said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour.\n\nLabour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the legislation.\n\nRegardless of the outcome in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday \u2013 the first in 37 years \u2013 if MPs approve the unusual move.\n\nThey will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or there will be discussions on what to do next in the Brexit saga.", "description": "Boris Johnson is in a race against the clock to secure a fresh agreement.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/08/wire-19729526-1571126326-482_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
