She says that very affordable clothing from retailers like Zara and Gap and H&M has created a great deal of waste, much of it containing synthetic microfibers that will not decay.\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re so cheap, we buy in volume, we buy sacks and sacks of these clothes,\u201d Thomas says on this week\u2019s podcast. \u201cNinety-nine percent of our garments and our apparel today is not recycled, and most of it winds up in landfill. And the average garment is worn seven times before it\u2019s tossed and that\u2019s all because of the fast fashion revolution.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nSteven Greenhouse visits the podcast this week to discuss his new book, \u201cBeaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor.\u201d Greenhouse talks about the major problems currently facing the labor movement in the United States, and the ways in which unions lost the power they had in the middle of the 20th century. \u201cUnfortunately there was terrible corruption in many unions in the 1950s and 1960s,\u201d he says, \u201cand that justifiably gave them a black eye, got them very bad press. Unions are much less corrupt now, but that image still lasts.\u201d", "description": "Dana Thomas discusses \u201cFashionopolis,\u201d and Steven Greenhouse talks about \u201cBeaten Down, Worked Up.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/books/11podcast-sub/11podcast-sub-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
