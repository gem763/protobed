Quinn is at large and Nolan\u2019s defence lawyer entered a plea on his behalf.\n\nThe EFCC said in a statement that the two men were directors of two companies that the agency alleged failed to report to the anti-graft agency a single deposit of $125,000 into a local account and also failed to comply with local requirements to declare their activities to the trade and investment ministry.\n\nThe charges relate to a 2010 contract with British Virgin Islands-based firm Process and Industrial Developments (P&ID) to build and operate a gas-processing plant in the southeastern port city of Calabar.\n\nP&ID took Nigeria\u2019s government to international arbitration after the deal\u2019s collapse, eventually winning a $6.6 billion award. It has been accruing interest since 2013 and is now worth more than $9 billion.\n\nThe government has said the deal was designed to fail and called the award \u201can assault on every Nigerian and unfair.\u201d P&ID said the EFCC had harassed, intimidated and denied due process to individuals associated with the company and the contract.\n\nThe EFCC has also charged a former petroleum ministry official with accepting bribes and failing to follow protocol.\n\nThe trial of the two Britons is scheduled for Nov. 20 and 21.", "description": "Nigeria's anti-fraud office on Monday charged two Britons in the capital, Abuja, for alleged money laundering in connection with an ill-fated gas deal that has left the government facing a disputed bill of more than $9 billion.", "authors": ["Camillus Eboh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
