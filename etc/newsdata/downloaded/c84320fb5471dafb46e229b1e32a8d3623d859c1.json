REUTERS/Daniel Becerril\n\nThat marks a dramatic change from only a year ago.\n\nIn early October 2018, Brazil\u2019s current president, Jair Bolsonaro, was in a tight electoral race with Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party. Global executives feared a Haddad victory would reverse recent pushes to provide them an opening in Brazil\u2019s oil industry, which for years had been dominated by state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Brazil at the time had fierce competition in the race to attract capital.\n\nBusiness-friendly governments in Argentina and Ecuador were auctioning exploration blocks and working to lure foreign oil companies.\n\nIn Mexico, leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had not yet taken office, and investors were still benefiting from free-market reforms that had opened up access to prized oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn the last year, many of those competitors have effectively taken themselves out of the game.\n\nLopez Obrador, widely known as AMLO, halted a liberalization of Mexico\u2019s energy market. Protests and economic crises have undercut Argentina and Ecuador\u2019s would-be reformers.\n\nBy contrast, Bolsonaro has made dramatic strides toward expanding global energy firms\u2019 role in Brazil \u2014 with over a dozen bidders in back-to-back oil auctions next week expected to fetch around $28 billion in signing bonuses.\n\nSome companies have said the terms look expensive.\n\nBut with fewer material options on the table, the world\u2019s oil heavyweights are likely to pony up.\n\n\u201cThese are different markets, but the trend when you look at everything that\u2019s going on, is that Brazil is held in high regard,\u201d said oil and gas specialist Alexandre Calmon, a partner at law firm Tauil & Chequer.\n\nBOLSONARO VS AMLO\n\nBeyond the billions of barrels of oil becoming available off its coast, Brazil\u2019s new government has also been a beacon for foreign investment in the energy sector.\n\nThe previous government, under former President Michel Temer, had already taken key steps to open up Brazil\u2019s energy market, easing restrictions on equipment imports and creating a schedule for oil auctions, among other measures.\n\nSince taking office in January, right-wing President Bolsonaro has doubled down, tapping free-market advocates to run the Economy Ministry and Petrobras.\n\nThey have overseen billions of dollars in asset sales, working to dismantle state control of fuel refining and distribution while opening former Petrobras fields to new players.\n\nIn Mexico, AMLO has suspended scheduled auctions and is focusing the strategy to boost output on contracts to oil service firms in which Pemex maintains firm control over oilfields.\n\nEcuadorian President Lenin Moreno has been weakened by protests. On Sunday, Argentines voted President Mauricio Macri out, returning leftists to power who have previously urged the nationalization of energy assets.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilians have been very disciplined even after the government change. Petrobras ... has finally shown a coherent divestiture program,\u201d said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico-based energy analyst. \u201cMexico not only fell behind, it also changed its vision on the industry.\u201d\n\nNext week could cement Brazil\u2019s ascendance, as 14 companies \u2014 a who\u2019s who of oil majors \u2014 will bid on Nov. 6 in Brazil\u2019s so-called transfer-of-rights (TOR) auction. Fixed signing bonuses total 106.5 billion reais ($26.4 billion).\n\nThe TOR area, which will be auctioned off in four pieces, is considered a rare prize, as it is already known to hold billions of barrels of untapped crude.\n\nStill, others are warning that investors\u2019 appetites are not without limits. Executives at BP PLC and Portugal\u2019s Galp Energia SGPS SA have said that Brazil\u2019s oil rounds are getting expensive.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIn an interview last week, Equinor\u2019s Brazil chief warned that Brazil was competing with countries all over the world - not just Latin America - for big oil\u2019s attention.\n\n(For a graphic on Brazil's upcoming TOR auction: here)", "description": "When executives arrive in Rio de Janeiro this week for Brazil's biennial Offshore Technology Conference, they will find themselves in Latin America's most promising market for Big Oil by far.", "authors": ["Marta Nogueira", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445929644&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1FR", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
