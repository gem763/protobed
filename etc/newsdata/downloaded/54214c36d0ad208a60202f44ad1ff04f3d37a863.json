The states said they were home to \u201cthe highest percentages of taxpayers whose federal tax burden increased\u201d under the new rule. All four are Democratic-leaning states.\n\nImage: Getty More\n\n\u2018An invasive and unprecedented attempt\u2019\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James called the administration\u2019s limitation \u201can invasive and unprecedented attempt by the federal government to curtail\u201d state constitutional rights. James said her office was reviewing the decision as it considered its available options. That could include an appeal. \u201cWe remain committed to defending our taxpayers and our state,\u201d she said.\n\nNEW YORK, NY - JUNE 11: New York Attorney General Letitia James speaks during a press conference, June 11, 2019 in New York City. James announced that New York, California, and seven other states have filed a lawsuit seeking to block the proposed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. James said that the merger would deprive customers of the benefits of competition and potentially drive up prices for cellphone service.

The state\u2019s filers who itemized deductions under the old rule claimed $21,943, on average.\n\nNew Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland argued that in 2018, alone, taxpayers from their states paid $7.5 billion more to the federal government than they would have paid without the cap.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
