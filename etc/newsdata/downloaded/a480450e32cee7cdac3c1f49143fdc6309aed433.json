Half-finished canvases lean against walls. The bustle and noise of the city is far away.\n\nGresham Tapiwa Nyaude and Helen Teede are among a new wave of young artists in Zimbabwe who are attracting attention from collectors and curators worldwide. Both now work in a converted house surrounded by forest, a 40-minute drive from the capital, Harare.\n\nAlmost two years after Robert Mugabe, who died this month, was ousted in a military takeover, Zimbabwe is enjoying an unlikely boom in contemporary art, despite an economic crisis and unstable, sometimes violent, politics. The success is linked to its problems, the artists say.\n\n\u201cWe want to talk about the time we are living in [in our paintings] \u2026 It comes out abstract and indirect but we have a collective responsibility to address what we know, what we see \u2026 There is source material in every day,\u201d Teede, 31, told the Guardian.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Helen Teede: \u2018There\u2019s always been a crazy amount of talent here \u2026 But all the best work is being sold overseas and that is a big loss.\u2019 Photograph: Jason Burke/The Guardian\n\nValerie Kabov, who runs the First Floor Gallery in the centre of Harare and represents many emerging artists, said the post-Mugabe boom had been \u201cunequivocal\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of international collectors coming and there is interest growing all the time \u2026 For a very small population of artists, the number of internationally successful artists that have emerged from Zimbabwe is really extraordinary.\u201d\n\nKabov attributes the depth of talent in Zimbabwe to a tradition of education and intellectual inquiry, and \u201cliving in a really interesting matrix\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey cannot make work that is not important because there is nothing in their lives that is not important. There is none of this navel gazing. Here everything is real. The work comes from a really strong place emotionally \u2026 You add a little bit of skill and \u2026 boom!\u201d\n\nArt from across the African continent has enjoyed a surge of international interest in recent years, with works newly visible in art shows, featured in the specialist media and sought after by major institutions.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside? Show Hide Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa has already been described as \u201cAfrica\u2019s Tate Modern\u201d. There are also new museums in Marrakech and Lagos.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town. Photograph: AP\n\nLast year, the prestigious Frieze magazine published a long report on contemporary art in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe South African Goodman gallery is opening in London next month with a show that includes works by Kudzanai Chiurai, one of Zimbabwe\u2019s best known contemporary artists. Another well-known artist, Misheck Masamvu, won fame when Zimbabwe invested in a pavilion at the Venice Biennale art fair in 2011.\n\nSince 2012, Kabov has travelled to international art fairs to represent her artists and boost the international profile of the country in the contemporary art world.\n\n\u201cZimbabweans themselves are not aware of the extreme talent in their midst, because it is not considered an indigenous tradition,\u201d she said.\n\nThe devastating economic legacy of Mugabe\u2019s 40 year rule means artists in the former British colony face many obstacles: a lack of exhibition spaces, limited opportunities to sell their work and difficulties getting basic supplies of artistic materials.\n\nTeede is concerned that the lack of a major domestic art market will mean that little work currently being produced remains in the country.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a crazy amount of talent here \u2026 But all the best work that is being produced at this super exciting time is being sold overseas and that is a big loss. In 50 years maybe there will be a museum and it will all have to be brought back,\u201d she said.\n\nMany aspiring artists attend workshops run by the National Gallery, founded in 1957 and housed in a Le Corbusier-inspired building in the centre of Harare.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gresham Tapiwa Nyaude, in front of his work. Photograph: Jason Burke/The Guardian\n\nNyaude, who studied at the National Art Gallery for two years and was picked to exhibit at the high-profile New Museum Triennial in New York last year, said one factor driving the boom was economic.\n\n\u201cYou have a possibility as an artist to do pretty well and there is so little other opportunity so if you have a drive to make art, that\u2019s a push factor,\u201d he said.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa, a former spy chief and senior ruling party official who was confirmed as Mugabe\u2019s successor in a contested election last year, had promised voters he would make Zimbabwe \u201copen for business\u201d. But foreign investment and re-engagement with the international community has been stymied by widespread human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cLiving in Zimbabwe, you are affected by the politics every day, not directly, but it is there \u2026 The absurdity of the situation defies language. You can\u2019t speak about politics directly here.Painting is a way of working things through that you can\u2019t think through logically,\u201d said Nyaude, 31.\n\nAmanda Mushate, a 23-year-old artist represented by Kabov, said the biggest obstacle she faced was reconciling her creative ambitions with the expectations and habits of her friends.\n\nOne recent painting, entitled WhatsApp Gold, was inspired by the intensive use of social media of many of her peers.\n\n\u201cThe biggest difficulty as an artist is to be myself, to be the real me in my social life,\u201d Mushate said. \u201cOther girls of my age, they are interested in their careers and don\u2019t understand me being an artist. If they came to appreciate what I do, that would be my biggest achievement.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
