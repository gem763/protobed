The Center for Reproductive Rights sued the state of North Dakota on behalf of Red River Women's Clinic and the American Medical Association\n\nFARGO, N.D. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge in North Dakota on Tuesday blocked a state law enacted earlier this year that required physicians to tell women they may reverse a so-called medication abortion if they have second thoughts.\n\nNorth Dakota is among eight states to pass or amend laws requiring doctors to tell women undergoing medication abortions they can still have a live birth after the procedure. The other states with similar laws are Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Utah. Five of those laws were passed this year.\n\nThe North Dakota law also would require doctors to tell the patient \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d if she changes her mind.\n\nTammi Kromenaker, director of North Dakota\u2019s sole abortion clinic in Fargo, which filed a lawsuit in June, said the law would force doctors to give false information that is not backed up by science.\n\n\u2019It\u2019s simple,\u201d Kromenaker said. \u201cPatients need to be able to trust their providers.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland said in his order that state lawmakers should not be mandating unproven medical treatments and the provisions of the bill \u201cgo far beyond\u201d any informed consent laws addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court, Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \u201cor other courts to date.\u201d\n\nHovland was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2002 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate that same year. He is scheduled to take senior status this year.\n\nSupporters say the hormone progesterone may stop an abortion after a woman has taken the first of two medications needed to complete the abortion. Republican state Rep. Daniel Johnston, who sponsored the bill, said earlier that the measure does not restrict abortions and couldn\u2019t see \u201chow anyone could be against it.\u201d Republican North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed the bill in March.\n\nMarc Hearron, attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the issue came down to free speech and protecting the First Amendment rights of physicians.\n\n\u201cAcross the country, doctors are being used as political pawns in the attack on abortion,\u201d Hearron said. \u201cWe all have the right to free speech and to speak the truth. That doesn\u2019t change because you\u2019re a doctor who provides abortion care.\u201d\n\nThe complaint from the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic and the American Medical Association also targets an existing law requiring doctors to tell patients that abortion terminates \u201cthe life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being.\u201d The court has yet to rule on that aspect of the suit.", "description": "The law required doctors to tell patients they could reverse their \"medicated abortion\" if they acted quickly and underwent what a judge called \"unproven...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77de7e3b0000c49fd0c594.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
