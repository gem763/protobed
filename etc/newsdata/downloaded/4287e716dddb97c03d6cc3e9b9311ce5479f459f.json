Washington\u2019s embargo obsession shows lack of ideas", "language": "en", "text": "The Washington establishment is now threatening sanctions against NATO ally Turkey if it moves against the US-allied Kurdish militias in Syria, once again showing that coercion is the only arrow in its policy quiver.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans spoke up against President Donald Trump\u2019s decision on Monday to move back some of the US troops stationed \u2013 illegally \u2013 in Syria, declaring that this would be a death knell to the Kurdish militias the US has used as boots on the ground against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorists.\n\nTrump himself threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d the Turkish economy if Ankara did anything he considered \u201coff limits,\u201d but that was not enough for Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina). Though often Trump\u2019s ally on matters domestic, the unrepentant foreign policy hawk threatened Turkey on Tuesday with \u201csanctions from hell\u2026 wide, deep and devastating\u201d if it enters northern Syria.\n\nIf Turkey moves into northern Syria, sanctions from hell \u2013 by Congress \u2013 will follow.\n\n\n\nWide, deep, and devastating sanctions. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 8, 2019\n\nThis is not the first time the South Carolina senator has threatened \u201csanctions from hell.\u201d He used that exact phrase to promote his proposed sanctions against Russia, back in February. Who knows what would have happened if the \u2018Russiagate\u2019 conspiracy theory hadn\u2019t crashed and burned soon thereafter.\n\nSanctions are a bipartisan affair in Washington. Only two senators voted against the sweeping CAATSA bill in July 2017, for example. Contrast that to the opposition to tariffs, when 88 voted against Trump\u2019s trade wars in July 2018 \u2013 though to be fair, Graham was one of the 11 defending the president.\n\nYet tariffs are a mere tax on trade, while sanctions prohibit it entirely. Arguably, sanctions are war by other means. Journalist Max Blumenthal describes them as \u201cfinancial terrorism, a high-tech medieval siege.\u201d\n\n.@MLB\u2019s decision to ban players from Venezuela\u2019s winter league didn\u2019t discriminate between govt and the people and neither has this one by @Adobe.\n\n\n\nSanctions are financial terrorism, a high-tech medieval siege. https://t.co/GlMqgOPmIW \u2014 Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) October 8, 2019\n\nAt the heart of this policy is a premise, accepted by the US political elite unquestioningly, that their country is the rightful master of the world and anyone who dares to disagree is a rogue state that must be beaten into submission.\n\nBefore you blame the Bad Orange Man, however, note that this worldview long predates him. Back in March 1999, at the height of neoliberal globalism, Thomas Friedman preached in the New York Times that \u201cThe hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist.\u201d\n\nAnd the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley's technologies to flourish is called the US Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nOne thing you are never, ever supposed to ask is whether the sanctions actually work. Noticing that the longest-running embargoes \u2013 against Cuba (1962) and Iran (1979) \u2013 have done nothing to change either the \u201cregimes\u201d in Havana and Tehran or their behavior, probably amounts to a hate crime.\n\nAlso on rt.com Our knee-jerk Russia sanctions hurt our interests, time to get smarter, former US envoy to Moscow says\n\nOnly after he resigned as the US ambassador to Moscow did Jon Huntsman dare say that US sanctions against Russia have been ineffective, and even harmful to Washington\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cRussians have accepted that US sanctions will probably remain in place for the long term, inevitably distorting the market as Russians create alternative supply chains that aren\u2019t always conducive to American interests,\u201d Huntsman wrote in an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal on Monday.\n\nTurkey\u2019s reaction to Graham\u2019s \u201csanctions from hell\u201d proposal seems to be developing along the same lines. Ankara\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Serdar Kilic, called them \u201cundue threats to a KEY NATO ALLY.\u201d\n\nDear Senator, our main objectives are ensuring safety and security of our citizens,achieving peace and stability in our region and preserving territorial integrity and political unity of Syria. Which one of these goals,in your mind,justify these undue threats to a KEY NATO ALLY. \u2014 Serdar KILI\u00c7 (@serdarkilic9) October 8, 2019\n\nWhen all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When every policy is either a carrot or a stick, everyone looks like a donkey. If the US was serious about \u201cdiversity,\u201d it would look for a wider range of opinion, tools and policies.\n\nNebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
