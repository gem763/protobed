That ain\u2019t going to stop it.\n\nSean Dyche absolutely hates diving (Picture: AMA/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a reflection of the game or the scoreline, Chelsea were too good for us tonight.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s got to go out of the game. It\u2019s ridiculous now. Young players, young players diving, I just can\u2019t stand it.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s shambolic how people dive about the place, I keep hearing the word respect, and I get shot down for saying this, I sit there amazed \u2013 respect the game. That is what people should be doing.\u2019\n\nThis is not the first time Dyche has decried the curse of diving in the Premier League, as he was also unimpressed with the actions of Arsenal players in August.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not encouraging for the game of football, I\u2019m really worried for the game of football,\u2019 the Clarets boss said after his side were beaten by the Gunners.\n\n\u2018People diving all over the place today \u2013 it has to go.\n\n\u2018I was at a Premier League meeting actually and it was brought up.\n\n\u2018Did you know the maximum you can get for a dive is a yellow card? So for every player in the Premier League they can cheat at least once a game and get nothing other than a yellow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think it will stop, do you? It\u2019s not likely to stop.\u2019\n\nMORE: Christian Pulisic becomes the youngest Chelsea player to score a hat-trick after Burnley demolition\n\nMORE: Chelsea boss Frank Lampard picks out Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic for praise after seeing off Burnley", "description": "Sean Dyche has reignited his war on diving and slammed Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi after the teenager was booked for simulation against Burnley on Saturday night.
