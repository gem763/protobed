(Never Go Full On Socialist)", "language": "en", "text": "Bernie came out of the hospital like a bat out of hell and is now taking a no-holds approach to his 2020 presidential campaign. The Vermont Democratic Socialist slammed his presidential rival Senator Elizabeth Warren for being too much of a capitalist. That's right, the Hydrox cookie of candidates Bernie Sanders is knocking a United States elected official for somewhat believing in the greatest economic system known to man. Sanders' comments indicate a shift in his campaign rhetoric, and show that we could see some real fireworks at Tuesday night's CNN debate. But perhaps before he embarrasses himself on stage and advocates for one the most repressive economic systems ever, Sanders should read a new book from Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, The Case Against Socialism.\n\nOn Sunday, Sanders sat down with ABC News to explain the key differences between himself and Warren.\n\n\"Elizabeth has been a friend of mine for some 25 years, and I think she is a very, very good senator,\" Sanders told the network. \"But there are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth, as I think you know, has said she is \u2018a capitalist through her bones.\u2019 I\u2019m not.\"\n\n\"I am, I believe, the only candidate who\u2019s going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite: 'Enough. Enough with your greed and your corruption,'\" Sanders added. \"We need real change in this country.\"\n\nGeorgia Senator David Perdue expressed his shock and dismay that America has now reached a point where a self-avowed anti-capitalist could be a serious contender in the eyes of many for the U.S. presidency.\n\n\"I never thought we'd have to build a case about why capitalism is better than socialism. I never thought we'd see a time where attacking your political opponents by calling them 'capitalists' was mainstream in one political party,\" Perdue tweeted.\n\nI never thought we'd have to build a case about why capitalism is better than socialism.

Sanders will not listen to Sen. Perdue, maybe he will listen to another colleague: Rand Paul. Paul has a new book out just in the nick of time to stop the scourge of socialism festering throughout the body politic.\n\nLast night on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" Sen. Paul sat down to discuss his new book.\n\n\"Some of it is they have forgotten their history,\" Sen. Paul explained about the crop of 2020 Democrats. \"And part of the book is we talk about the fact that Hitler was a socialist, Stalin was a socialist, and about 100 million people died in the last century primarily from genocide, and famine, and primarily from the collectivism and socialism, but they seem to have forgotten that.\"\n\nRand also told Tucker that so many people confuse the Scandinavian economy with socialism, which he dispels in his latest piece of work.\n\n\"So we spent a lot of the book describing the fact that Scandinavia first is not socialist, but we also report that, you know what, Bernie is actually too much of a socialist to even get elected in Denmark. The prime minister of Denmark Said 'Bernie, quit calling us socialist, we are not socialist, We are open for business, and you are ruining our business by telling the world we are socialist and we are not,\" he quipped.\n\np.s.: I'm currently reading Sen. Paul's book, The Case Against Socialism. It is well worth the read! It will equip you with the facts and moral arguments you need to defeat any lefty you may come across. Whether you are debating a Che Guevara-loving college kid or a gray haired moonbat trying to relive the 60s, or even if you get the chance to chat with Sen. Sanders, you need to read this book before you defend capitalism.", "description": ".10/15/2019 10:56:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/c4230cf6-9b0a-40af-b4f3-0998be0040a7.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
