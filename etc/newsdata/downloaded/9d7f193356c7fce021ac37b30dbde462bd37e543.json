The hidden elements were discovered by phone security experts Cure 53 who noted that the app gives the Chinese government \u201csuper-user\u201d access to individuals devices.\n\nThe app was released in February and has since become the most downloaded free program in China thanks to demands by the Chinese authorities that citizens download and install it. The Chinese government has denied that the app had the monitoring abilities listed by Cure 53.\n\nThe article publishes official news and images from the Chinese government and encourages users to earn points by reading and commenting on articles as well as playing quizzes about China and the country\u2019s leader Xi Jinping. The use of the app is mandatory for some party officials and civil servants and is often tied to wages in some workplaces. Journalists in the country must pass a test about the life of President Xi via the app this month in order to obtain a press card enabling them to do their jobs.\n\nGerman cyber-security firm Cure 53 analyzed the app on behalf o the Open Technology Funds which campaigns on human rights issues. Cure 53 said in its report that the Great Nation app had \u201cextensive logging\u201d abilities.\n\nThe report stated that it was \u201cevident and undeniable that the examined application is capable of collecting and managing vast amounts of very specific data.\u201d The app also weakened encryption used to hide data and messages making it easier for the government to gain access. The report stated: \u201cThe app contains code resembling a back door, which is able to run arbitrary commands with super-user privileges.\u201d\n\nAdam Lynn, research director at the Open Technology Fund, told the Washington Post: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very uncommon for an application to require that level of access to the device, and there\u2019s no reason to have these privileges unless you\u2019re doing something you\u2019re not supposed to be.\u201d The Chinese government denied that the app worked the way that Cure 53 had described.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
