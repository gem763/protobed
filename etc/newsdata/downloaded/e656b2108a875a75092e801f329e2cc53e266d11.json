Police had been watching garbage deposits from a certain part of the city, he said.\n\nSmith said police were obtaining murder warrants against two people previously identified as persons of interest in the case, 39-year-old Patrick Devone Stallworth and his 29-year-old girlfriend, Derick Irisha Brown.\n\nLawyers for both have said they are innocent.\n\nThe child, known as \u201cCupcake\u201d to relatives, vanished while outside a birthday party on Oct. 12. Investigators know of no link between the suspects and the girl or her family, Smith said.\n\n\u201cWe believe this was something they thought about and acted upon. They saw an opportunity to take a young child, and they did,\u201d said Smith, who did not reveal a potential motive.\n\nStallworth, arrested after officers located a vehicle seen near the abduction site, previously was charged with child pornography, but authorities said the charge wasn\u2019t related to the missing child.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how long the child might have been dead. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the girl\u2019s parents were experiencing \u201cunimaginable\u201d pain.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough moment for our city, a tough moment for the family,\u201d he said.\n\nGov. Kay Ivey, in a statement Tuesday night, offered her condolences to Kamille\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThe heart of our state is broken\u2026,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cOur prayers remain with Kamille\u2019s family and all who have been touched by this nightmare.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Investigators searching through garbage found the body of a 3-year-old girl who was missing more than a week, and authorities are charging two people with murder, police said Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jay Reeves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/alabama_kidnapping_99510_c0-809-1444-1651_s1200x700.jpg?7aa0216def51e11a1eacfaa931472225275229a6", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
