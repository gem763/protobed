Mueller III and occasionally still complains about the senator. Sessions was fired in November 2018 by tweet.\n\nAD\n\nThe three people familiar with the meetings spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk frankly about Sessions\u2019s deliberations.\n\nAD\n\nSessions, 72, has joked in recent weeks that he was glad he was not shot by the president and has continued to give public and private remarks supporting him.\n\nHe has not taken any public positions since being fired from the administration.\n\nThe move was first reported by Politico. A close Sessions ally said the former attorney general had not yet made a final decision.\n\nAlabama\u2019s senior senator, Richard C. Shelby (R), told reporters in June that Sessions had not ruled out a bid for his old seat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to him about it,\u201d Shelby said at the time. \u201cI think if he ran, he would be a formidable candidate. Formidable. I\u2019ve not encouraged him to run, but he\u2019s a friend, and if he ran, I think he\u2019d probably clear the field.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSessions resigned from the seat in 2017 after Trump tapped him to become attorney general.\n\nAD\n\nIf he runs, Sessions would be joining a crowded field of Republicans seeking to face Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) in next year\u2019s general election. Trump bested Hillary Clinton in Alabama by 28 percentage points in 2016, and Jones is one of only two Senate Democrats seeking reelection in states won by Trump.\n\nAmong the Republicans who have already announced is Roy Moore, the party\u2019s failed 2017 candidate. Moore fell short in the special election against Jones two years ago amid allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls in the 1970s. Moore has acknowledged interaction with the women but denied any sexual contact.\n\nOther Republicans who have already joined the race are former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Rep. Bradley Byrne, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and state Rep. Arnold Mooney.\n\nColby Itkowitz contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The former attorney general is said to have been meeting with consultants, retired senators and allies to plot out a potential 2020 campaign.", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wrlCeZyG8EyFPGrMYVOzcXS6SbY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GJYOWPEBLII6TFNJ4LEDBL7CJ4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
