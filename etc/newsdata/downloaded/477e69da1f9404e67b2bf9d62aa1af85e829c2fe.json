I do think it's cruel to expect a dog to be vegan.\n\nMs Pearce's (pictured) controversial post racked up 5,200 comments and even Piers Morgan jumped in to say he'd 'never seen a sadder looking dog, give it some damn meat'\n\n'Poor little mite.'\n\nAnother user said: 'When a dog's gone vegan we can be pretty sure the dog didn't make that decision.'\n\nAnother said: 'No. The. Dog. Can't. Go. Vegan. Its digestive system is literally designed to process high protein and fat meals that can't be replaced with anything plant based.\n\n'Filling your dog with potatoes and rice is about the same as you eating sawdust.\n\n'You won't be hungry but its useless.'\n\nJack said: 'You don't deserve that dog. You can be a vegan but your dog needs meat as well to survive.'\n\nAnother critic added: 'Are you stupid or what? Dogs can't be vegan, they're carnivorous. This is animal abuse.'\n\nSaeger Ryman said: 'I can be a vegan, but your dog can't. You are an animal abuser; feed this dog properly, or find it a proper home where it won't be abused by a political zealot.\n\n'This is why we call virtue signalling dangerous. It's always somebody else harmed so a horrible person can show off.'\n\nFootballer Peter Crouch replied to Piers Morgan's outburst to say: 'He looks like he'd love a sausage'\n\nAnother said Suzannah was 'out of order.'\n\nThey added: 'You can be whatever you want as can I, but I don't push my views on others like you do.'\n\nRob Porter said: 'I think it's important to add that the dog is vegan by force, not choice.'\n\nAnd another said: 'Dogs grew up eating meat. Taking meat away from dogs is like taking fruit and vegetables away from vegans...you can't change evolution.'\n\nOthers went so far as to report the woman for animal cruelty and accused her of forcing her dog to do something against its will\n\nAnd another added: 'Get a f****** hamster or some s*** if you want a herbivore.'\n\nOthers said she was killing the dog through vitamin deficiencies.\n\nDogs can actually be vegan, although cats cannot.\n\nThe RSPCA has been approached for comment.", "description": "Suzannah Pearce faced furious backlash after posting the picture of her dog on Twitter with a note attached reading: 'If I can be a vegan, so can you!'
