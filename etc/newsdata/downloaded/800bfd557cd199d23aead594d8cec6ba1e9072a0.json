I just need to keep working hard and if I\u2019m called upon, I need to make sure I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nGuehi is set to feature for the Young Lions in an important Euro qualifier against Austria at MK Dons on Tuesday.\n\nThe visitors are currently top of Group 3, with three wins from three, so boss Aidy Boothroyd knows a tough game lies in store.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey\u2019re a team that can score goals. We won\u2019t be able to be anything other than right on our game and professional and if we are then we should have enough to give them more problems than they give us hopefully.\n\n\u201cThey will be difficult. They\u2019re all playing. It\u2019ll be a tough game. It\u2019s one of those that if we go chasing it, we could have a problem but at the same time they\u2019ll want to come away with something to keep them top.\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019s an important one, we\u2019ve got to go and try and win it. We\u2019ve also got to be careful.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "England Under-21s defender Marc Guehi has been tapping his hero John Terry for advice as he tries to make his way in the game.
