The Straits Times\n\nFrom December 28, bus and train fares will cost more for everybody, except polytechnic students.\n\nMore families will get a S$50 voucher to help them cope with the new price.\n\nEven with the increased prices, Singapore has one of the world\u2019s lowest transport fares compared to other developed countries.\n\nSorry, worker bees \u2013 bus and train fares are going up again.\n\nFrom December 28, adult commuters taking trains and buses must pay 9 cents more if they are using a fare card, and 20 cents more if they are paying in cash or buying single-trip tickets.\n\nMeanwhile, senior citizens, disabled people and low wage workers \u2013 who number about 2 million in Singapore \u2013 will see their fares go up 4 cents.\n\nIn addition, prices of an adult monthly travel pass will also increase by S$8, while monthly concession passes for students, NS men, senior citizens and the disabled will go up between S$1 and S$5.50.\n\n#FRE2019: Here\u2019s an overview of the new schemes, public transport vouchers and fare changes effective from 28 December 2019. Posted by Public Transport Council on Tuesday, 8 October 2019\n\nThe increased prices were announced on Tuesday (Oct 8) following a fare review by the Public Transport Council (PTC).\n\nIt added that all polytechnic and diploma students \u2013 who previously paid adult fares \u2013 would now be eligible for student fares, and could save up to S$1.54 per trip.\n\n#FRE2019: Did you know? About 1 in 2 Singaporeans enjoy concessionary fares on public transport.

Posted by Public Transport Council on Tuesday, 8 October 2019\n\nIt ranked third for senior citizen fares and first for student fares.\n\nThe PTC said increased energy prices last year, local salaries and other macroeconomic factors had made public transport more expensive, but these costs were not passed fully to commuters.\n\nIt added that Singapore plans to pump S$1 billion into renewing the MRT operating systems in the next five years.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Sorry, worker bees - bus and train fares are going up again..
