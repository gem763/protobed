While his talent is undoubted, he has a reputation as a difficult player to manage, and he sat out of the whole second half of PSG's campaign last season after falling out with the club over his contract.\n\nHe was also suspended after going to a nightclub after the side's loss to Manchester United in the Champions League in March.", "description": "Eriksen has long been linked with a move away from Spurs and Juventus are the latest club to be touted with a move for the playmaker", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Juventus Fc Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17283158.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Adrien-Rabiot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
