It offered the same streaming experience as Amazon\u2019s other Fire TVs, but the built-in microphones allowed the Cube to be used entirely hands-free through voice commands. It could also control cable boxes, soundbars, and A/V receivers with the help of built-in IR blasters. But the original Cube lacked Dolby Vision HDR, and eventually Amazon released a cheaper Fire TV Stick 4K that did have Dolby Vision for less money, leaving the do-everything Cube in an awkward spot.\n\nSo for 2019, Amazon has refreshed the Fire TV Cube to make it the clear flagship of the lineup. It\u2019s got the same exact design as before, but now has Dolby Vision, a more powerful processor, and faster response times. Amazon is trying to lessen the Cube\u2019s dependence on the cloud, with a new \u201clocal voice control\u201d feature that processes basic commands on the device itself. And the new Fire TV Cube can still control your home theater components and dim the smart lights when you sit down for movie night \u2014 all with just your voice.\n\nOur review of Amazon Fire TV Cube (2019) Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Now has Dolby Vision\n\nFaster performance\n\nYouTube has returned Bad Stuff IR blasters are forever imperfect\n\nDoesn\u2019t make much sense if you have an Echo already\n\nYou\u2019ll still need remotes around Buy for $119.99 from Amazon\n\nThe Fire TV Cube looks completely unchanged on the outside. It has the same controls as an Echo speaker on top (with a matte texture) with eight tiny microphone holes, and it\u2019s glossy everywhere else. I get that Amazon chose this design for maximum IR signal passthrough, but the thing remains a huge dust magnet nonetheless.\n\nAround back is an HDMI output, power, an input for the included IR extender, and a Micro USB port for the ethernet adapter (also in the box) if you need it. You\u2019ll want to use the thin IR extender cord if some of your home theater components are out of sight or tucked into a cabinet. Unfortunately, Amazon still isn\u2019t including an HDMI cable with the $120 Fire TV Cube.\n\nAmazon recommends that you place the Cube at least one foot away from any speaker. Even with audio blaring from a Sonos Beam, I found the mics to be pretty good at picking up my voice and the \u201cAlexa\u201d hotword at a normal speaking volume.\n\nDolby Vision and HDR10+ are new to the second-gen Fire TV Cube; the first model only had basic HDR10 support. HDR passthrough worked just fine on my TCL TV, with the display automatically recognizing when Dolby Vision or HDR10 content was being played and applying the right expanded color and brightness settings. With all major formats now supported, you\u2019ve got plenty of choices for streaming 4K between Netflix, Prime Video, Vudu, and other apps. As a Fire TV, this year\u2019s Cube is objectively superior to the original.\n\nBut it\u2019s still only so-so as a universal remote. The Fire TV Cube can control most TVs, receivers, and soundbars \u2014 plus some cable boxes You\u2019re asked to choose your devices during setup, after which Alexa will know the ins and outs of your gear. Generally, the IR emitter works well at getting commands through to your home theater components and turning everything on in sync. But for other hardware like game consoles or Blu-ray players, Alexa can\u2019t do very much at all. The Cube will switch to the right HDMI input, but then you\u2019re on your own. That\u2019s all you can really expect from IR blasters, but companies like Caavo are trying to do more with on-screen machine learning.\n\nStill, Alexa does feel more responsive this time around. Local voice control results in certain basic voice commands being executed up to four times faster than before, because the Cube handles them directly and doesn\u2019t need any help from Amazon\u2019s servers. The awkward pause after a voice command is gone \u2014 but only sometimes.\n\nLocal control works for your common functions like navigating the UX. You\u2019re literally telling Alexa which way to scroll or picking a number to open the app or content that you want to watch (\u201cAlexa, play number 5\u201d). Apps like Netflix and Hulu have been optimized for hands-free voice control with these on-screen numbers next to selections , but that\u2019s not true for many other streaming apps. In those cases, you\u2019re still better off just using the physical Alexa remote. And the Cube will still need to check with the cloud for a lot of commands, even if the basics are now considerably speedier.\n\nAs for its secondary function as a smart speaker, the Fire TV Cube has become a better Alexa speaker thanks to continued software updates. It now supports calls, voice messages, and the Drop In feature, so it\u2019s basically on equal footing with an Echo. You can also add the Cube to a multi-room music setup with other Alexa devices. Remember that the Cube always plays music requests through your soundbar or TV speakers; the built-in speaker is fine for Alexa\u2019s voice responses but isn\u2019t suitable for much else.\n\nAGREE TO CONTINUE: AMAZON FIRE TV CUBE Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. Using a Fire TV Cube requires an Amazon account, which means you\u2019ll have to agree to the company\u2019s conditions of use and privacy notice to get started. It\u2019s also important to be aware of privacy settings for Amazon\u2019s Alexa since the voice assistant plays such a large role on this device. The Fire TV platform comes with its own privacy settings (enabled by default) that allow Amazon to: \u201cUse personal data collected by the operating system of this device for marketing and product improvement purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllow Appstore to collect information on the frequency and duration of use of downloaded apps.\u201d There\u2019s also an \u201cinterest-based ads\u201d option that lets you opt out of apps using your device\u2019s advertising ID to build a profile for targeted ads. Separate from this, you can choose to reset your advertising ID. Final tally: two mandatory agreements, plus Alexa privacy policy and data sharing settings that are specific to Fire TV.\n\nAmazon says the Cube now has a hexa-core processor, and the Fire TV interface has felt snappy in my time using it so far. But some owners of the original device found that it bogged down over time and exhibited an irritating amount of lag, and I haven\u2019t had enough time to rule out that possibility. Amazon is adamant that the Fire TV Cube is now its fastest Fire TV, however, whereas the Fire TV Stick 4K set the bar before. So it should be more consistent and able to run Kodi, Plex, and other apps without issue.\n\nThe software experience largely matches that of other Fire TV devices. All the apps you\u2019d want are there, and Amazon has finally patched up the YouTube hole that existed last year. YouTube TV is now available as well, though Sony\u2019s PlayStation Vue gets preferred treatment among streaming TV services and is integrated directly into Amazon\u2019s live guide.\n\nMy usual nitpicks with Fire TV\u2019s home screen remain: Amazon can push its originals a little too aggressively, and it also steers customers towards Prime Channel subscriptions for HBO, Starz, Epix, and other networks. But when you search for a genre or specific movie or show, the platform does a good job of showing you everywhere it can be streamed. And seeing visual responses for Alexa queries (like asking for the weather or searching for nearby restaurants) is a nice touch. But these features aren\u2019t unique to the Cube; they\u2019re now part of Fire TV OS as a whole.\n\nI think the Fire TV Cube makes the most sense for people who are just getting started with Amazon\u2019s ecosystem. If you already have an Echo Dot in your living room, the Fire TV Stick 4K makes more sense. It offers all of the same Dolby and HDR support and costs just $50. Plus, the Alexa Voice Remote bundled with that device is also capable of controlling your TV and soundbar. You\u2019ve really got to want the Cube\u2019s hands-free powers \u2014 and its ability to pull double duty as an Alexa speaker when the TV screen is off \u2014 for the $120 to be worth it.\n\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge", "description": "Amazon\u2019s second-generation Fire TV Cube adds Dolby Vision HDR and faster performance to a streaming device that also doubles as an Alexa smart speaker and universal remote.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EnirBZ4C_YkL22ZQHCO2jcdn1F0=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19273596/cwelch191009_3721_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
