Jay Inslee of Washington and John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, exited the race in August after it became clear that they would not qualify for the fall debates. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York dropped out last week after failing to qualify for the September debate and realizing he stood almost no chance of getting onstage next month.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, who both participated in the September debate and have qualified for the October one, have in recent weeks emailed appeals to supporters warning they could be left off the stage in November and December without an uptick in their fund-raising.\n\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey sent a message to supporters over the weekend, saying that without an infusion of $1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign may no longer be viable. On Monday, he sent another email acknowledging the newly released debate thresholds, noting that he had not reached 165,000 individual donors and asking supporters to chip in. According to the Times analysis, he is the only candidate who has participated in all of the debates and has not yet reached 165,000 donors.\n\nGov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who did not qualify for the September debate and is not likely to make the stage for October\u2019s, has been one of the most vocal critics of the process.\n\nHe renewed his attacks this month after it became clear that Mr. Steyer would qualify for the October debate after using millions of dollars of his own money to buy advertisements that have helped him draw in donations and increase his standing in the polls.", "description": "The Democratic National Committee said it would impose slightly higher thresholds to qualify for the November debate.", "authors": ["Reid J.
