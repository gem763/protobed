Weintraub said was a Republican commissioner\u2019s effort to block a draft memo on prohibited foreign national electoral activity from being included in the digest, which led to the digest being withheld from the public.\n\nAD\n\nBut Weintraub found a way to get the information out.\n\n\u201cFunny story,\u201d she began in a Friday tweetstorm.\n\nAD\n\nThe Democratic chairwoman published the digest in piecemeal, with 57 tweets in all, including the foreign national prohibitions memo \u2014 all while calling out the commissioner who she said sought to block it from being widely publicized online.\n\n\u201cGOP FEC Commissioner Caroline Hunter took the altogether unprecedented step of objecting to its being added to the Digest and blocked publication of the whole,\u201d Weintraub said, referring to the memo.\n\n\u201cI always thought these anti-regulatory people liked the First Amendment well enough,\u201d Weintraub said in a follow-up tweet. \u201cI guess they think it\u2019s just for corporations. I\u2019m not fond of anyone trying to suppress my speech.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe digest itself was fairly routine and mostly included updates on civil penalties handed down for campaign law violations.\n\nBut Weintraub\u2019s defiance is notable for its timing, as foreign involvement in the U.S. political system has turned the news cycle into a very focused dumpster fire.\n\nAD\n\nAn intelligence community whistleblower said President Trump may have improperly pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, prompting lawmakers to consider impeachment.\n\nU.S. attorney warns of possible Russian interference in 2020 elections\n\nA critical mass of Washington officials have said Russia interfered in the 2016 election and have emphasized the integrity of the 2020 elections as a key focus across the government. Top intelligence and technology officials briefed Congress on preparations this summer, and Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, told lawmakers Thursday that election security is his agency\u2019s \u201cmost fundamental priority.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere is one notable dissenter on the seriousness of a foreign threat to elections: Trump. The Washington Post reported Friday that Trump told Russian officials in 2017 that he was unconcerned over their 2016 interference because, he said, the United States conducts similar disruption campaigns.\n\nAD\n\nElection integrity is a key focus for the FEC, and Weintraub has often raised the issue from her perch. Her memo focuses on financial contributions from foreign nationals for all U.S. elections, for which there are broad restrictions that she summarized in a June op-ed in The Post.\n\n\u201cI am gravely concerned about ongoing efforts by geopolitical adversaries to undermine our democracy,\u201d Weintraub wrote. \u201cIt is critically important that everyone involved in U.S. politics understands the law, recognizes the threat, and confronts and contains it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWeintraub and Hunter did not return requests for comment.\n\nWeintraub has irked Republican lawmakers by challenging Trump. Last month, she asked the president to substantiate claims of voter fraud in New Hampshire that he made during a rally in Manchester. Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), a member of the House Administration Committee, accused her of partisanship.\n\nAD\n\nFEC commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Weintraub has chaired the commission three times since her appointment by President George W. Bush in 2002.\n\nWeintraub has sounded the alarm over the commissioners\u2019 inability to conduct their official business. The commission needs four of six members to meet and take action.\n\nAD\n\nBut there are only three at the moment \u2014 Weintraub, Hunter and Steven T. Walther, an independent. To encourage bipartisanship, no more than three commissioners can represent the same political party at a given time.\n\nWeintraub has laid out what practical consequence that has for voters and the public.\n\n\u201cIf people are not doing what they should do \u2014 are not voluntarily complying with the law, and there are complaints filed, we will not be able to process them,\u201d she told NPR in August.\n\nRead more:\n\nActing intelligence chief Maguire defends his handling of whistleblower complaint in testimony before Congress\n\nTrump told Russian officials in 2017 he wasn\u2019t concerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in U.S. election\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI always thought these anti-regulatory people liked the First Amendment well enough,\" FEC Chair Ellen L.
