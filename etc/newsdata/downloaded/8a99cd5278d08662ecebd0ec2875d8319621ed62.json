The planet they\u2019d discovered, known as 51 Pegasi b, was too big.\n\n\u201cWe were as surprised as everybody to find a planet because the planet that we found was absolutely bizarre and it\u2019s not at all the way you would have expected a planet to be,\u201d Queloz told AFP Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI remember many discussions I\u2019d had with Michel and trying to demonstrate that it was not a planet but in the end we always circled back and said that that\u2019s the only explanation.\u201d\n\nThe exoplanet was roughly the size of Jupiter, yet was more than 20 times closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun.\n\nSuch dimensions baffled the team.\n\nSara Seager, planetary scientist and astrophysicist at MIT, who was a grad student at Harvard when Mayor and Queloz made their discovery, recalled a \u201chuge controversy\u201d at the time.\n\n\u201cNo one likes their paradigm to be upset, and we just really wanted to believe everything we were taught in school, that Jupiters form far from the star,\u201d she told AFP.\n\n\u201cPeople were very resistant, and rightly so in science -\u2013 you can\u2019t see the planet, you don\u2019t have a photo of one, you\u2019re just seeing the star, the effect on the star, so people wanted to put that effect (down) to something else.\u201d\n\n\u2013 4,000 and counting \u2013\n\nQueloz said the team\u2019s discovery took time to be acknowledged because prior to the research exoplanets were \u201cstuff for weirdos\u201d within the astronomy community.\n\n\u201cThere were people assembling in the corner of a meeting talking but nobody would officially speak about it, it was too bizarre,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, thanks to their pioneering work, there are more than 4000 known exoplanets and billions of stars thought to be orbited by them.\n\n\u201cWe are studying the origins of life and that\u2019s exactly what exoplanets are doing,\u201d Queloz said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the field is growing. Now there must be 1000s of people working on this, which is fantastic.\u201d\n\nAnd how does it feel to be the newest Nobel Physics Laureate, a quarter of a century after his initial eureka moment?\n\n\u201cI can still breathe, which is a good sign.\u201d", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 As a student astronomer scanning the skies with homemade instruments a quarter of a century ago, Didier Queloz spent months doubting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/969593_swiss-astronomer-didier-queloz-on-tuesday-shared-nobel-prize-in-physics-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
