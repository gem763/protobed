Kiehl's/Facebook\n\nI used to scoff at anyone who spent any time, money, or energy on eye cream. To spend any of that on such a small amount of skin seemed unnecessary to me. Until one day at the ripe old age of 16 when I seemed to develop pigmentation under my eyes overnight.\n\nAs the only person in my group of friends with dark circles, I asked myself the question every young teen (and probably millennial) asks \u2014 why me?\n\nI went to the Internet for answers and found a beloved product recommended by every makeup guru and vlogger \u2014 Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado.\n\nI remember saving up my small allowance to buy a small $30 jar. I loved it from the very beginning, but since it was the first eye cream I'd ever used, I figured I should try others over the years. Some were hits, most were misses. I had truly forgotten about this one until I picked up a new jar again this year \u2014 and I regret ever having tried anything else.\n\nIt's made with avocado oil, shea butter, and vitamin C to hydrate and brighten skin. Kiehl's/Facebook\n\nIn the past decade, I had practically given up on treating my dark circles. Being Indian, I'm genetically predisposed to that kind of pigmentation earlier in life than others may be.\n\n\"We generally get under-eye circles before other people, even as early as our teens,\" says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Manjula Jegasothy. \"The biggest difference between Southeast Asian skin is that the eyelid skin is particularly delicate and fragile in Indian people so that's the place where we age the first.\"\n\nRe-enter Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment With Avocado.\n\nI love trying out new products, but eye creams never excited me because nothing really ever worked for my dark circles. I only picked this one up again when I was traveling and left usual my eye cream at home. I picked this one up at an airport, remembering how much I liked it years ago. After just one week, I saw my dark circles decrease significantly to the point where I was seeing a clear difference every time I woke up and looked in the mirror. My love for eye cream was reborn.\n\nIn addition to my genetic predisposition, I also have a history of extremely dry and sensitive under-eye skin. It gets easily irritated to the point where I sometimes wake up to flaky skin. The under-eye skin is so delicate that it's easy to tug or pull when applying or taking off makeup, which can cause capillaries underneath to break and can cause pigmentation.\n\n\"In Indian skin, the pigmentation caused by broken capillaries under the skin tends to persist more in the area with brown pigmentation as opposed to other [parts of the] skin which tend to be more red,\" says Dr. Jegasothy.\n\n$30 for eye cream can seem unnecessary, but it's the only thing that has brightened my genetically dark under-eye circles so it's worth the investment to me. Kiehl's/Facebook\n\nSince I started re-using this about a year ago, I haven't experienced a single moment of dry, flaky, or irritated skin. Not only does my under-eye skin look more moisturized and brighter, it's smoother too. Though I love using concealers and color correctors, I certainly don't feel the need to wear one every single day the way I used to. And when I do, they go on with more ease.\n\nThe mint-green color melts into my skin seamlessly while vitamins A and C helps brighten skin. It's pretty thick so I only use it at night after removing makeup, cleansing, and using a toner. But the ingredient that increased brightness the most was the vitamin C.\n\n\"Vitamin C is wonderful for the eye area because it does two things \u2014 it decreases pigmentation, but it also produces collagen,\" says Dr. Jegasothy. \"So it makes that delicate skin under the eye a little thicker.\" Basically, if you're concerned about fine lines, this cream might be really effective too.\n\nThe $30 price tag for an eye cream can seem like a lot. But I barely tap my finger into the pot before patting the cream onto my under-eye area and along my occipital bone, so it goes a very long way. And since I only use it at night, this pot has lasted me a year with plenty to spare. I also use far less under-eye concealer (when I bother to wear it now), so I've saved money there too.\n\nSure, there are a ton of eye creams out there touting vitamin C and other brightening ingredients, but this cult-favorite moisturizer from Kiehl's has been a true game-changer for me. Once I was told my circles were genetic, I had practically given up on trying to brighten them, overcompensating with layers of concealer. Now I wear less makeup and feel more confident \u2014 and that is priceless to me.", "description": "The Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado from Kiehl's has really helped lighten my dark circles, proving that avocados are more than a millennial snack.", "authors": ["Neha Tandon"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cee91f111e2050cfb2a1176-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
