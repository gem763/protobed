We haven\u2019t seen the actual wedding cake the drawing was based on, so we can\u2019t assess the exact likeness, but who needs a photo when you have an artwork this vivid and detailed?\n\nJacob\u2019s mum Hannah, 30, from Gillingham, Dorset, was pretty delighted with her son\u2019s drawing, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo much so that she had to try desperately not to laugh as Jacob presented his drawing while still at the wedding.\n\nJacob\u2019s creative interpretation of the wedding cake, complete with plenty of fruit (Picture: CATERS NEWS)\n\nWhy would she laugh? Because the cake looks quite a bit like a penis, apparently.\n\nWe can\u2019t see it. Get your minds out of the gutter.\n\nHannah, who is a lunchtime supervisor, said: \u2018I was trying not to laugh when Jacob showed me as I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.\n\nJacob with the template he used and the resulting drawing (Picture: CATERS NEWS)\n\n\u2018As soon as I saw it one thing sprang to mind and when he added the \u2018fruit\u2019 I thought it was even funnier as it looks like something is wrong with it.\n\n\u2018My husband Glen, 31 and I have been laughing all week and our friends think it is brilliant too.\n\n\u2018The picture isn\u2019t going to make into on the fridge, but we will definitely keep it in a memory book for him to look back on when he is older.\u2019\n\nMORE: Bride heartbroken when peacock wedding cake she ordered looks like a \u2018lopsided turkey with leprosy\u2019\n\nMORE: Biscuit-obsessed couple have Lotus Biscoff-themed wedding with melted spread fountain and mini jars as favours\n\nMORE: Couple have three foot tall Disney themed cake at their wedding\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Jacob Francis ran out of things to colour while attending a wedding with his mum, so set about drawing the cake.
