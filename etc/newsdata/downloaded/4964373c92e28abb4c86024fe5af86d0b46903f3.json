Russian media earlier reported that Leonov had had health issues for several years.\n\n\"His name will forever remain in history,\" Roscosmos said in a letter to Leonov's family.\n\n\"His greatest memorial will be our country's future achievements in space travel, to which he dedicated his heroic life.\"\n\nNASA broke into its live televised coverage of a spacewalk by two Americans outside the International Space Station to report Leonov's death.\"A tribute to Leonov as today is a spacewalk,\" Mission Control in Houston said.\n\n190926061419169\n\nOn March 18, 1965, Leonov made history when he left a spacecraft during the day-long Voskhod-2 (Sunrise-2) mission for a spacewalk that lasted 12 minutes and nine seconds.\n\nThis came as the Soviet Union and United States, Cold War foes, were locked in a frantic race to conquer space.\n\nLeonov's spacewalk preceded the first US one, by Ed White, by less than three months.\n\nOn his second trip to space 10 years later, Leonov commanded the Soviet half of Apollo-Soyuz 19.\n\nHe was twice decorated with the country's top honour, the Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\n'Loss for the whole planet'\n\nBorn in Siberia, Leonov was a fighter pilot before becoming a cosmonaut. He was a friend of Yuri Gagarin, who became the first man in space in 1961 and trained with him.\n\nTributes poured in from across the world on Friday, with Western space agencies and experts praising Leonov's contribution and admirers bidding him farewell.\n\n\"The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic.\"\n\n\u2014Alexei Leonov (first spacewalker, 1934-2019) pic.twitter.com/gao9bVG9qR \u2014 Andrew Rader (@marsrader) October 11, 2019\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin sent his condolences to Leonov's loved ones, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\n\"Putin always admired Leonov's courage and thought he was an extraordinary man,\" Peskov told Russian news agencies.\n\nNASA on Friday offered sympathy to Leonov's family, saying it was saddened by his death.\n\n\"His venture into the vacuum of space began the history of extravehicular activity that makes today's Space Station maintenance possible,\" NASA said on Twitter.\n\nWe\u2019re saddened by the loss of legendary @roscosmos cosmonaut Alexei Leonov who became the first human to walk in space on March 18, 1965.
