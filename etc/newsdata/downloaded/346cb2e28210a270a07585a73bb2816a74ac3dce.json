I had never been an activist before,\u201d Mason, whose case has been highlighted by civil rights activists as a blatant example of voter suppression, wrote in a Monday op-ed published in The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cBut now that I know what the system can do to people, I have to use that knowledge to educate the next generation and to let them know what their rights are. I want to let them know that we can make a difference as a whole,\u201d she continued.\n\nI was arrested for voting, but I won\u2019t let the government intimidate me, Crystal Mason writes https://t.co/CWAYE3ajQB \u2014 Washington Post Opinions (@PostOpinions) September 30, 2019\n\nMason, who is appealing her conviction, cast a provisional ballot in Tarrant County, Texas, in November 2016. She had recently completed a prison sentence for felony tax fraud and, though still on supervised release, was steadily rebuilding her life.\n\n\u201cI was enrolled in classes, working long hours to keep my home and watching my older children graduate from high school,\u201d Mason wrote. \u201cVoting wasn\u2019t really at the top of my mind at the time.\u201d\n\nBut, Mason said, her family had instilled in her a sense of civic responsibility; so \u201con Election Day, we went to the same polling place we always went to.\u201d\n\nMason said she had no idea that she was ineligible to vote at the time (felons in Texas are prohibited from voting while they\u2019re serving their sentences, which includes incarceration, parole and probation) and had accepted a volunteer election worker\u2019s suggestion that she cast a provisional ballot after her name couldn\u2019t be found on the rolls.\n\nMason\u2019s ballot was never counted, but Tarrant County\u2019s Republican District Attorney Sharen Wilson charged her for voting illegally nonetheless. Wilson alleged that Mason had knowingly flouted the law \u2015 something Mason has vehemently denied.\n\n\u201cNo one had ever told me I couldn\u2019t vote. Not while I was in prison preparing to reenter society, and not while I was on supervised release,\u201d she wrote in the op-ed.\n\nCrystal Mason, sentenced to 5 years in prison for illegal voting, writes in a @washingtonpost op-ed about her case: \"The people who pay the price are folks such as me who believe they were doing the right thing. It\u2019s a life-altering price.\" https://t.co/YZlKsiTr4m pic.twitter.com/8RKTinA8Z1 \u2014 Sam Levine (@srl) September 30, 2019\n\nAs HuffPost\u2019s Sam Levine reported last month, 12,668 provisional ballots have been cast in Tarrant County since 2014 \u2015 and election officials have rejected 11,085 of them. Mason, however, appears to be the only voter among them who\u2019s been singled out for prosecution.\n\n\u201cCrystal\u2019s case is an effort in voter suppression. This has nothing to do with whether or not she was eligible to vote,\u201d Kim Cole, one of Mason\u2019s attorneys, told the congregation at Mason\u2019s church on Sept. 8. \u201cThey don\u2019t want folks who look like Crystal to show up at the polls.\u201d\n\nTwo days after Cole\u2019s remarks, Mason appealed her sentence before a three-judge, all-Republican panel in Fort Worth. The court appeared hesitant to overturn her conviction, Levine reported.\n\nThe ACLU has said that it will petition the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state\u2019s highest criminal court, to review Mason\u2019s case if the panel declines to throw out her conviction. The court has yet to announce its decision.\n\nIn her op-ed this week, Mason said her experience has emboldened her to share her story with younger voters.\n\n\u201cWhen I had my welcome-home party after returning from prison this year (I had to serve extra time in federal prison because my illegal-voting conviction was considered a violation of the terms of my release), I had a voter-registration table there for younger adults. It was a party with a purpose,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cI see hope in the new up-and-coming generation. They\u2019re loud, and they speak out about their rights. They\u2019re making noise in a good way, because they know in their hearts that if our votes didn\u2019t matter, the system wouldn\u2019t be trying so hard to stop us,\u201d she continued.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
