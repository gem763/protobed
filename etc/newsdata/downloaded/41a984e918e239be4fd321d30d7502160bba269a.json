Apartment", "language": "en", "text": "Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has reportedly been living \u201con and off\u201d at a \u201csecret\u201d Washington, D.C., apartment with her rumored Democrat consultant boyfriend after denying for months that she and her husband were no longer together.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported Monday that Omar and Tim Mynett have been seeing each other when Minnesota Democrat is in town, publishing several photos of the two both entering and leaving a D.C. apartment, separately. Mynett, whose wife recently filed for divorce from the political strategist after he allegedly confessed his love for Omar, spent at least six nights with the Minnesota Democrat in September, according to the Mail\u2018s surveillance. Omar filed for divorce from Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her three children, in a Minnesota courthouse earlier this month.\n\nThe Daily Mail shares \u201cphotographic evidence\u201d of its claims, including pictures of Omar entering the passenger seat of a blue Mustang which Mynett is purportedly driving.\n\nMynett has been seen coming and going from her cozy basement apartment a few minutes from Capitol Hill with clothes, groceries and six packs of Stella Artois beer. He\u2019s also been whisking mom-of-three Omar around DC in his bright blue Ford Mustang, despite her insistence she needs a constant security detail because of threats to her life. The pair are careful not to be seen entering and leaving the rented digs at the same time but they spent at least six nights together in September, including Thursday, September 20 into Friday, September 21.\n\nDespite the Mail\u2018s continued reporting, both Omar and Mynett have both vehemently denied carrying out an extramarital affair together, while questions have arisen about the pair\u2019s business dealings. Since 2018, Omar has paid nearly $230,000 in campaign funds in consulting fees and travel expenses to Mynett\u2019s political consulting company E Street Group.\n\nThe arrangement prompted the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in which the group alleges the congresswoman illegally used campaign money to help carry on an affair with Mynett. FEC guidelines prohibit lawmakers from using campaign money for personal travel expenses unless the candidate pays the money back with their personal funds.\n\n\u201cIf Ilhan for Congress reimbursed Mynett\u2019s LLC for travel so that Rep. Omar would have the benefit of Mynett\u2019s romantic companionship, the expenditures must be considered personal in nature,\u201d NLPC\u2019s complaint reads.\n\n\u201cRep. Omar\u2019s filings do not reveal subsequent reimbursements for Mynett\u2019s travel,\u201d the complaint added.", "description": "Ilhan Omar has reportedly been living \"on and off\" at a \"secret\" D.C. apartment with her rumored Democrat consultant boyfriend Tim Mynett.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1167449529-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
