The @GMB logo and time were in an unfortunate position this morning @itvcalendar #gmb.'\n\nOh dear: The ITV chatshow showed a clip of Scunthorpe Steelworks, which had a sign that read: 'Welcome to British Steel Scunthorpe', but the GMB logo covered the 'S' leaving it reading: 'Welcome to British Steel c**thorpe'\n\nFunny: The error didn't go unnoticed by eagle-eyed viewers at home who were left stunned over the crude sign with one show watcher tweeting a photo of the gaffe\n\nThe mishap left fans amused with one account responding to the tweet with: 'Brilliant, that made me smile,' followed by a laughing emoji.\n\nITV News Calendar aired the Scunthorpe Steelworks clip as the identity of the new owner of British Steel was once again in doubt on Wednesday with the Official Receiver responsible for selling the business in talks with other potential suitors.\n\nThe news is expected to cause concern among British Steel's 5,000 staff, including 4,000 at its plant in Scunthorpe, and a further 700 on Teesside in north-east England.\n\nAlso on Thursday's Good Morning Britain, host Kate received some brutal home truths from Jake Quickenden about her possible I'm A Celebrity debut, as he joked that she will be 'pooing in a bucket.'\n\nPictured: ITV News Calendar aired the Scunthorpe Steelworks clip as the identity of the new owner of British Steel was once again in doubt on Wednesday (Scunthorpe steelworks pictured)\n\nThe presenter was left in hysterics by the revelation just minutes after getting hot under the collar as she watched a shirtless clip of Jake from his Hollyoaks debut.\n\nDuring a chat with Jake, Kate heavily implied she will be entering the jungle in November, although ITV are yet to confirm the lineup.\n\nJake - who finished second on the show in 2014 - offered some advice to the star if she was planning to jet Down Under, which included a brutally honest revelation about the famous 'dunny.'\n\nHilarious: Also on Thursday's Good Morning Britain, host Kate received some brutal home truths from Jake Quickenden about her possible I'm A Celebrity debut, as he joked that she will be 'pooing in a bucket'\n\nSavage: Jake was quick to tell Kate that she would be 'pooing in a bucket' as he reflected on the famous 'dunny'\n\nHe told her and Ben Shephard: 'So if someone was to go in, I would try to make them feel better. I'd say they get pizzas delivered and all that. But to be honest, that doesn't happen.\n\n'You eat rice and beans. The showering is cold shower. Bathroom situation is you basically poo in a bucket and I had to empty that. So after (fellow camp mate) Edwina Currie had eaten a curry - emptying the toilet - it's curry by name, curry by nature.'\n\nGood Morning Britain continues on weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "The ITV chatshow showed a clip of\u00a0Scunthorpe Steelworks, which had a sign that read: 'Welcome to British Steel Scunthorpe'.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/13/20130158-0-image-a-48_1571921864904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
