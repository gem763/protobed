Though the DNC is funding the new personnel, the Democratic Party in each of the individual states will employ them.\n\nThe funding for those states\u2019 organizers, which will be responsible for outreach to voters in key constituencies, comes from the DNC\u2019s State Party Innovation Fund. The DNC did not provide a dollar figure for the investment, but said it was larger than comparable investments at this stage in the 2016 election cycle.\n\n\u201cOrganizing at the community level is our highest priority as the DNC,\u201d Muthoni Wambu Kraal, the DNC\u2019s national political and organizing director, said in a statement. \u201cPeople are our most powerful resource in this election \u2015 from rural and urban communities, to secular and nonsecular communities, to voters of every ethnicity, age, and background.\u201d\n\nThe investment, which the DNC emphasized is the first of several rounds of funding, provides a look at states that national Democrats believe can propel them to victory against President Donald Trump in November 2020. In particular, the funding for Texas, a historically conservative state where Democrats have been gaining, is likely to raise some eyebrows.\n\nThe roles for which the funding is earmarked also offer an idea of the demographic groups that Democrats see as most essential to their bids. The DNC is funding the positions of Latinx and Native American outreach directors in Arizona; African American and Latino constituency directors in Florida; an African American outreach director in Michigan; a constituency outreach director in Texas; a youth vote director and rural organizing staff in Wisconsin; rural organizing and constituency outreach staff in Pennsylvania; Asian-American and Pacific Islander and Latinx organizing staff in Nevada; and grassroots outreach staff in Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe need people from all walks of life to organize and create the change this country needs,\u201d Wambu Kraal said. \u201cAnd that requires the early investments the DNC is rolling out now.\u201d\n\nSince Chairman Tom Perez took over the DNC in February 2017, he has sought to repair relations between the party committee and state-level parties still reeling from the neglect they felt they endured during the Obama presidency. Notwithstanding major funding challenges, Perez quickly increased the DNC\u2019s monthly payments to the state parties from $7,500 to $10,000.\n\nStill, Perez has periodically been at odds with some state party officials over matters including his endorsement in the New York gubernatorial primary, the makeup of a centralized data trust, and even the dissemination of grants from the State Party Innovation Fund.", "description": "The states, which include Texas, offer insight into the Democratic strategy for unseating President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9135332400003900d4a6f4.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
