They face hostility toward opinions that don\u2019t conform to the predominantly leftist thinking on campus.\n\nThey\u2019re also immersed in identity politics that pit students of different backgrounds against one another.\n\nDespite these problems, colleges continue to raise tuition. Because federal loan money is handed out with little scrutiny as to the student\u2019s ability to pay it back, colleges have had free reign to raise prices at levels often double the inflation rate.\n\nFlush with all that money, their first spending priority often isn\u2019t the classroom but the bureaucracy.\n\nFrom 1987 to 2012, America\u2019s higher education system added more than half a million administrators, doubling the number of administrators relative to the number of faculty.\n\nTo pay for these ever-increasing costs, students are borrowing more money and taking on more and more debt.\n\nAnd with federal loans accounting for much of the $1.5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt and more than a million people defaulting on their loans, taxpayers are picking up much of the tab for this broken system.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the solution?\n\nWhile politicians often suggest throwing more money at the problem, that will only make things worse.\n\nIn fact, the surest way to stop the sharp rise in both college tuition and student debt is to get the federal government out of the student loan business.\n\nThat cuts off the open spigot of money that has allowed colleges to increase costs virtually without limit.\n\nRestoring private lending will make the loan market more responsible and cause colleges to rein in costs, creating more affordable choices for students.\n\nPrivate lending will also limit taxpayers\u2019 exposure to billions of dollars in loan defaults.\n\nOne emerging private lending solution is coming from colleges themselves in the form of income share agreements.\n\nSuch agreements allow students to obtain financing from their schools and pay it back based on a percentage of their income after graduation.\n\nThat means their monthly loan payments are lower when their income is lower, ensuring that loan payoffs are more affordable, or that they can pay them off quicker when their income is higher.\n\nThis system allows students to see\u2014before they take on debt or choose a major\u2014what types of careers will allow them to pay off their loans quicker and what kind of future they are investing in.\n\nThis kind of cost savings and transparency is a win for students, for taxpayers, and for fiscal sanity.\n\nView more of America's Biggest Issues", "description": "To pay for these ever-increasing costs, students are borrowing more money and taking on more and more debt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-06/GettyImages-465727260.jpg?itok=6Wu-aCX0"}
