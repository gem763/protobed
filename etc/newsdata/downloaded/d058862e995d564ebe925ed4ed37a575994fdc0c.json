In Iwaki City, Fukushima, a rescue went tragically awry when a woman died after falling while she was being winched to safety.\n\nElsewhere, rescue workers carried out an hours-long boat operation to evacuate hundreds of people from a retirement home in Kawagoe, northwest of Tokyo, which was flooded up to its top floor.\n\nOne elderly woman wearing an orange life vest was brought out from a boat on the back of a hard-hat wearing rescuer. Others were hoisted onto wheelchairs and pushed along a muddy shore on arrival by boat.\n\nHagibis smashed into the main Japanese island of Honshu on Saturday night as one of the most violent typhoons in recent years, with wind gusts of up to 216 kilometres per hour (134 miles per hour).\n\n\u2013 \u2018Please do your best\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe storm claimed its first victim even before making landfall, when high winds flipped a vehicle, killing its driver.\n\nLandslides and flooding claimed more lives overnight, and the toll climbed higher after sunrise on Sunday, as the scale of the devastation wrought by Hagibis became clear.\n\nBodies were retrieved from submerged homes and vehicles, from raging overflowing rivers, and from buildings buried in landslides.\n\nThe dead included a municipal worker whose car was overcome by floodwaters and two Chinese crew members aboard a boat that sank overnight in Tokyo Bay.\n\nFour of the crew were rescued, but authorities were still searching for another six.\n\n\u201cThe government will do its utmost,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, vowing that rescue efforts would run through the night.\n\n\u201cPlease do your best,\u201d he told a disaster management meeting.\n\nMore than 110,000 homes were still without power by Sunday evening, with others experiencing water outages.\n\nAt the storm\u2019s peak, more than seven million people were placed under non-compulsory evacuation orders, and over 135,000 people were still in government shelters by Sunday evening.\n\nThe storm prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue its highest-level rain disaster warning, saying \u201cunprecedented\u201d downpours were expected.\n\n\u2013 \u2018I don\u2019t know where to start\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cThe water came up higher than my head in the house,\u201d Hajime Tokuda, a finance professional living in Kawasaki near Tokyo told AFP.\n\nHe moved to his family\u2019s home nearby, but that flooded too and they had to be rescued by boat.\n\nIn Saitama\u2019s Higashi Matsuyama city, northwest of Tokyo, rice and flower farmers were counting their losses, with water submerging warehouses full of freshly harvested produce.\n\n\u201cWe never had a flood like this before in this neighbourhood,\u201d said one farmer, who declined to give his name.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start cleaning this mess.\u201d\n\nThe storm brought travel chaos during a long holiday weekend in Japan, grounding flights and halting local and bullet train services.\n\nOn Sunday, train services began resuming and operations also slowly restarted at the two airports serving the capital, although many flights were cancelled.\n\nBut some lines remained halted, with aerial footage in Nagano showing rows of bullet trains partially submerged by flooding.\n\nThe storm also caused havoc for the sports world, delaying Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and forcing the cancellation of two Saturday Rugby World Cup matches.\n\nOn Sunday morning, organisers cancelled a third fixture \u2014 Namibia-Canada \u2014 but gave the go-ahead to three others including a crunch Japan-Scotland game in Yokohama, near Tokyo.\n\nScotland faced elimination if the match was cancelled and had threatened legal action if it was not played.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 At least 26 people were killed by powerful Typhoon Hagibis, local media reported Sunday, a day after the ferocious storm slammed into", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/7b79af_powerful-typhoon-hagibis-hit-tokyo-surrounding-region-weeks-strong-storm-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
