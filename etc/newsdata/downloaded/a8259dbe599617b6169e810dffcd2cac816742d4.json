All about their games, their prices, their streaming services, and all the other hoopla of the next generation. We\u2019ll also be drowning in retrospectives of the current generation, as people rush to tell everyone about their 10 best games of the generation and why Sony triumphed and Microsoft failed.\n\nSo I\u2019d like to get ahead of the crowd and tell you about my favourite game of the generation (and yes, there are some great-looking games coming out next sprin, but humour me).\n\nAs I\u2019ve heard many others say I was not a fan of the original God Of War games and was not looking forward to the (soft) reboot at all. I hated the character of Kratos and felt the games were pandering to angry American teens in a sort of delayed example of 90s style xtreme edginess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe odd thing about the reboot is that it wouldn\u2019t be as good a game if the previous games hadn\u2019t been like that, because it benefits so much from not only subverting your expectations but also showing real character growth in Kratos. It\u2019s very slow, and for a while seems like it\u2019s not going to happen at all, but God Of War features the best character arc of any video game character I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t do this through endless lengthy cut scenes but instead through gradual change, small comments, and changing reactions to events and the other characters you meet. It\u2019s subtle and it\u2019s realistic and while the other characters can be a little more abrupt (Atreus in particular) in how their stories pan out it\u2019s still handled very well.\n\nAnd just as importantly the gameplay is excellent too. There are perhaps not quite enough enemy types to last the whole running time, including a strange lack of boss battles, but everything else is perfect, with the exploration of the Lake of the Nine being easily my favourite gameplay experience of the whole generation.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect mixture of puzzles, combat, storytelling, and exploration \u2013 being open world but not so huge that you got lost and bored and compact enough that there\u2019s something new to see and do around literally every corner. The game is filled with secrets, including some side quests that are amongst the best things in the game, especially freeing the dragons and how all of that is portrayed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this comes back round to the question I mentioned at the start: why has Sony done so well this generation, when there\u2019s so little technical difference between the Xbox One and PlayStation 4? Many will say it\u2019s because of Microsoft\u2019s mistakes during its reveal but those have been completely forgotten by ordinary gamers now, even if they knew about them at all.\n\nNo, the real reason is simple: Sony\u2019s games were better. And I for one am very glad that that\u2019s the reason the console has been successful (and why the Switch has also succeeded).\n\nNothing matters except the games and it takes something of God Of War\u2019s quality to realise that. Naturally I\u2019m very much looking forward to seeing how a sequel will fare on the PlayStation 5, but it\u2019s not the better graphics I\u2019m excited about, it\u2019s seeing how it plays and how the story turns out. Because that\u2019s what\u2019s most important.\n\nBy reader Hault\n\nThe reader\u2019s feature does not necessary represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.
