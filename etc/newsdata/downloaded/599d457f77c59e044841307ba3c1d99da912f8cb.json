The 11-inch model (64GB, Wi-FI) is available at Best Buy or Amazon for $649.99. This is $150 off of the original price, beating the previous best price by $25. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s not nothing!\n\nIf you want the bigger 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2019) with 64GB of storage, that one costs $824.99 at Best Buy. It\u2019s $175.99 off of the price you\u2019d pay buying one directly from Apple, and like the 11-inch tablet, it\u2019s $25 lower than the best price we\u2019ve seen.\n\nThe iPad Pro tablets with more storage are cheaper, too, as are the Wi-Fi + LTE models. You can check out more options at Best Buy and Amazon.\n\nSignify (the owner of Philips Hue) is offering discounts on a few bundles that you won\u2019t find on Amazon, or at other retailers. The White Dimming Starter Bundle is $84 and includes three white dimming E26 Hue bulbs, a Hue bridge to connect the lights, and a dimming switch. This bundle usually costs around $105.\n\nIf you\u2019re already set up with a Hue bridge, a six-pack of white dimming E26 Hue bulbs costs $64. These usually cost around $15 per bulb, but this bundle reduces the per-bulb price to around $10.60.\n\nNintendo Switch Online subscribers have until July 31st to purchase two Switch game vouchers for $99.99. These can be redeemed for full-price games, like Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Super Mario Maker 2, and other Nintendo-made games.
