There is a lot of pain to be healed and the government should be aware of this,\u201d she said.\n\nEcuador moves government out of capital as violent protests rage Read more\n\nJust days ago, downtown Quito looked like a war zone: teargas hung in the air, pitched battles between riot police and protesters played out amid blazing roadblocks as explosions reverberated across the city.\n\nWhile some protesters were hooded troublemakers and armed with sticks and slingshots, others were indigenous women in traditional skirts and trilbies, outraged by Moreno\u2019s decision to end fuel subsidies.\n\nThat move caused the price of petrol to spike by a third and the cost of diesel to more than double \u2013 in turn, driving up food and transport costs in the country\u2019s dollarised economy.\n\n\u201cThe indigenous movement has been a powerful actor in Ecuador since the 1990s,\u201d said Mario Melo, a lawyer who heads the human rights centre at Quito\u2019s Catholic University.\n\nIndigenous protests played a central role in toppling a string of Ecuador\u2019s presidents, including Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram in 1997, Jamil Mahuad in 2000 and Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez in 2005\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only movement which has the capacity to paralyse the country \u2013 and the guts to confront these economic measures,\u201d which, he said, impacted the poorest.\n\nBut, for all its power, the indigenous movement was unable to stop protests from being hijacked by others intent on sowing chaos.\n\nJaime Vargas, the leader of the Ecuador\u2019s indigenous confederation Conaie, was at pains to distance his followers from masked men who attacked two TV stations and the main El Comercio newspaper, as well as journalists covering the protests.\n\nArsonists also targeted the the national auditor\u2019s building,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely curious that it is the only state building which has been totally burnt out,\u201d said foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Valencia, who noted the building held case files related to charges of alleged corruption against the former president Rafael Correa.\n\nMoreno has accused \u201cdark forces\u201d directed by his predecessor ex-president Rafael Correa and Venezuela\u2019s leader Nicolas Maduro along with \u201cdrug traffickers, [and] gangs with violent foreign citizens.\u201d Interior minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo said on Tuesday that 57 foreigners were arrested during the unrest.\n\nCorrea, who governed Ecuador between 2007 and 2017 and now lives in Brussels, has denied he was behind the unrest, although he called for Moreno to step down and floated the possibility of running for vice-president in fresh elections.\n\nBut the indigenous movement has little affection for Correa, who during his decade in power prohibited protests, jailed indigenous leaders and cracked down on demonstrations against oil drilling and mining on ancestral native territory.\n\nSantiago Basabe, a political scientist at the Latin American Institute of Social Sciences in Quito, said the indigenous movement had strengthened its political capital considerably. But he noted it had been \u201cabsolutely intransigent\u201d leaving the government with no alternative options to restructure massive debts, mostly to China.\n\nEcuador\u2019s indigenous nationalities represent just a tenth of Ecuador\u2019s population of 16m yet they have shown they are a political force too strong to be ignored. But their triumph, said Gualinga \u201chad been paid with indigenous lives.
