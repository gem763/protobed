Our patrolling officers are paying extra attention to the areas involved and anyone with concerns can speak to them at any time.\"\n\nIncident 1, July 22:\n\nThe incident took place on the junction of Ditchling Road and Princes Crescent. The suspect was described as a mixed race man, of medium build, in his 30s-40s and he spoke in broken English.\n\nIncident 2, October 5:\n\nThe incident took place outside Pavilion Gardens. The man was described as black, slim, about 6', wearing a black track suit possibly with white stripes down the arms.\n\nIncident, October 6:\n\nThe incident took place in Marine Parade, Brighton.
