A \u201csmall footprint\u201d of American forces will remain at a garrison in southern Syria to continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS, the president said in his statement.\n\nIt's not clear right now when the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria will be pulling back. The \u201csmall footprint\u201d the president referenced was the At Tanf garrison in southern Syria near Jordan, where troops are expected to remain to guard a supply line used by Iranian-backed forces to move weapons between Tehran and Beirut, as well as Damascus, the officials added. ISIS traditionally has not had a large presence in that part of Syria.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper released a statement a short time after Trump\u2019s tweet saying the decision by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to invade northern Syria has \u201cresulted in widespread casualties, refugees, destruction, insecurity, and a growing threat to U.S. military forces.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s invasion has \u201cresulted in the release of many dangerous ISIS detainees,\u201d Esper added in the statement.\n\n\u201cTurkey's unilateral action was unnecessary and impulsive. President Erdogan bears full responsibility for its consequences, to include a potential ISIS resurgence, possible war crimes, and a growing humanitarian crisis. The bilateral relationship between our two countries has also been damaged,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThe Pentagon statement said Esper will visit NATO headquarters next week in Brussels to \u201cpress our other NATO allies to take collective and individual diplomatic and economic measures in response to these egregious Turkish actions.\u201d\n\nEsper told Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Trump had ordered a \u201cdeliberate withdrawal\u201d from northern Syria. It was not clear if he meant leaving the country altogether.\n\nEsper hinted the retreat from Syria could take longer because of the large number of U.S. armored vehicles and heavy weapons currently on the ground in Syria\u2014military hardware he does not want to see fall into enemy hands.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we don't leave equipment behind. So I'm not prepared to put a timeline on it,\u201d he said on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nIn further evidence the relationship with NATO ally Turkey was deteriorating, Fox News is told the Pentagon canceled a planned Open Skies reconnaissance flight over Russia this week with the Turkish military. The flight aboard a Turkish plane with U.S. military observers on board is part of a long-standing arms control agreement between NATO and Russia.\n\nThe Pentagon has not immediately returned a request for comment on the canceled flight.\n\nCritics said the Trump administration has betrayed the Syrian Kurds--the main U.S. ally against ISIS.\n\nKURDISH FORCES ANNOUNCE DEAL WITH DAMASCUS AFTER U.S. PULLOUT\n\n\u201cWhat we're seeing on the ground is absolutely sickening. It\u2019s absolutely shameful that President Trump allowed Turkey to begin killing the Syrian Kurds who were our allies in the fight against ISIS,\u201d Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nEsper defended the decision to retreat. On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Trump\u2019s defense secretary said there was nothing the U.S. could do to stop Turkey\u2019s invasion.\n\n\u201cThey were fully committed to doing this, regardless of what we did. We thought it was prudent. It was my recommendation. I know the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed as well. We should not put U.S. forces in between a Turkish advance,\u201d Esper said. \u201cWe're talking less than 50, more like two dozen. There is no way they could stop 15,000 Turks from proceeding south.\u201d\n\nAsked if Turkey had behaved like a NATO ally, Esper was candid, \u201cThe arch of their behavior over the past several years has been terrible. I mean, they are spinning out of the western orbit, if you will,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThe situation in Syria following Turkey\u2019s invasion was getting \u201cworse by the hour,\u201d he added.\n\nEsper said Trump ordered roughly two dozen U.S. troops to pull back from Syria\u2019s border with Turkey border to avoid being \u201ctrapped\u201d by Russian and Iranian-backed Syrian forces pushing north and Turkish forces moving south.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. officials cited Turkish \u201cpropaganda\u201d as pushing the narrative that hundreds of ISIS fighters have escaped or were let go from Kurdish-run prisons in Syria.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe officials told Fox News that Turkish artillery units \u201cintentionally\u201d were shelling Kurdish-run prisons in Syria allowing ISIS fighters to escape.\n\nTurkey claimed 800 ISIS fighters escaped the border town of Tal Abyad, but the local prison held only a \u201cfew dozen\u201d ISIS prisoners, a U.S. official told Fox News, calling the claim \u201cTurkish propaganda.\u201d\n\nFox News' Chris Wallace contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump announced on Monday that U.S. troops in northeastern Syria will be withdrawn from the country as planned, and redeployed \"in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014,\" when the Islamic State made major territorial gains.", "authors": ["Lucas Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/14/694940094001_6094735053001_6094737883001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
