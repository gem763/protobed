Next Thursday's hearing with Maguire will be public.\n\n\"The director has said essentially that he is answering to a higher authority and refusing to turn over the whistleblower complaint. This is deeply troubling,\" Schiff said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\n\"Ignoring the subpoena, ignoring our request. No DNI -- no director of national intelligence -- has ever refused to turn over a whistleblower complaint.\"\n\nAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nA spokesperson for the DNI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe complaint involves conduct by someone outside the intelligence community, according to a letter to Schiff from Jason Klitenic, general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, obtained by ABC News.\n\nAccording to the letter, \"The complaint here involves confidential and potentially privileged matters relating to the interests of other stakeholders within the Executive Branch.\"\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP, FILE\n\nThe letter was first obtained by The New York Times on Tuesday.\n\nKlitenic also argued that the complaint doesn't meet the definition of \"urgent concern\" that would require the DNI to forward the matter to Congress, according to the Times.\n\nABC News' James Meek and Alex Mallin contributed to this report.", "description": "Schiff has accused the acting Director of National Intelligence of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/maguire-ap-er-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
