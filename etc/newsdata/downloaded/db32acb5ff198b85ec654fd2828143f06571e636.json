The cover story, by foremost aviation writer and former pilot William Langewiesche, seeks to reconstruct the chilling fate of the passengers and crew during the six hours that the plane remained aloft after dropping from radar and ultimately shattering into pieces in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe cover story, \u201cGood Night. Malaysian Three-Seven-Zero.,\u201d is out today and leads The Atlantic\u2019s July magazine issue, which will be on newsstands next week.\n\n\u201cIn truth, a lot can now be known with certainty about the fate of MH 370,\u201d Langewiesche writes. \u201cFirst, the disappearance was an intentional act. It is inconceivable that the known flight path, accompanied by radio and electronic silence, was caused by any combination of system failure and human error.\u201d Langewiesche reports that most of what we need to know about the flight\u2019s disappearance is currently knowable, thanks in part to electronic evidence; the black boxes, if eventually found, are unlikely to hold significant new information. Reporting from Malaysia, he meticulously pieces together all the existing evidence\u2014including insights from people close to the investigation, a family member of a victim, and people who knew the plane\u2019s captain\u2014to arrive at the most definitive telling yet of the flight\u2019s disappearance. His reporting exposes the deep inadequacies of the Malaysian investigation, which led the initial search thousands of miles astray and downplayed the likelihood that either pilot might be at fault.", "description": "On The Atlantic\u2019s July cover, the definitive account of how Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/0719_Cover_PR3/facebook.jpg?1560908490"}
