It is a case of: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about Brexit and a minority in the Commons \u2013 let\u2019s get on with governing.\u2019\n\nWe now have it all: a budget three weeks away on November 6, post-BHS pension reforms and a promise to finally sort out social care funding.\n\nAll of this will be a nightmare for Robert Chote and his team at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) which prepares budget forecasts.\n\nSajid Javid has already announced plans for a 4.1% rise in department spending budgets for 2020-21. But the forecasting gaps arising from different Brexit outcomes are enormous\n\nThere are some immediate \u2018knowns\u2019, including the 4.1 per centrise in department spending budgets for 2020-21 already unveiled by the Chancellor. But the forecasting gaps arising from different Brexit outcomes are enormous.\n\nIf, miraculously, a politically viable Brexit deal were to happen, the Javid/Johnson plans \u2013 an early glimpse of the Tory manifesto \u2013 would have a decent chance.\n\nJavid might even think about some supply-side tax cuts, such as bringing corporation tax down near to Irish levels. That might help prevent some of the hollowing out of UK intellectual property (see below).\n\nA positive outcome of the US-China trade talks would also help. But there is no escaping the downsides.\n\nAn estimate by think-tank The UK In A Changing Europe of a 7 per cent loss of output over the longer term if we leave the EU shows why it is critical to get a deal. In spite of the nasty headlines, these numbers don\u2019t look very different to those provided by the IMF almost a year ago.\n\nWhat Javid will have to fight against on November 6 are the fiscal guardians. The supposed headroom, once estimated at \u00a325billion or so, has already vanished in a cloud of accounting changes, including those for student loans.\n\nIf current budget ceilings are abandoned, the credit-rating agencies and holders of sterling assets will need to be convinced there is a credible replacement.\n\nAllowing fiscal policy to take up some of the slack in uncertain times is wise. But throwing away the budgetary and debt gains of a decade of hard times should not be handled lightly.\n\nCyber exit\n\nBritain is marking the US\u2019s Columbus Day holiday by probably allowing another byte of technology to fall into American hands.\n\nThe scenario is not unfamiliar. Oxfordshire-based Sophos, a self-described \u2018world leader in next generation cyber security\u2019, finds the public markets hard after several profit warnings and falls into the hands of \u2018tech-expert\u2019 private equity.\n\nPromises are made by new proprietors, San Francisco-based Thoma Bravo, to protect UK jobs. The share price soars and investors cheer from the side-lines.\n\nIn this \u00a33.1billion deal, currency risk is hedged by dollar pricing. But hang on a moment. When there was a glimpse of a Brexit deal on Friday, we saw how undervalued much of corporate Britain has become.\n\nThe FTSE 250 index soared, the pound climbed and in the blink of an eye some of the premiums being paid for UK firms by American private equity \u2013 Cobham and Inmarsat for a start \u2013 suddenly look far less generous.\n\nThen there is the damage to the future. The ownership of ARM Holdings by Softbank looks far less enticing now than before the sell-out of the China arm and the We Work fiasco, where it invested $10billion.\n\nThoma Bravo may want to take Sophos global, but it has been doing quite well on its own in ground-breaking \u2018cloud\u2019 security.\n\nCyber is a brilliant space to occupy, and the kind of next generation tech which fits in with Britain\u2019s security and aerospace strengths. At risk in such bids are R&D, brain power and patents.\n\nPrivate equity is based on quick turnarounds and the magic of leverage and low interest rates.\n\nBlackstone\u2019s feet have barely touched the ground with selling on Refinitiv to the London Stock Exchange.\n\nNone of this is very elevating.\n\nTimely prize\n\nWhat a good start to the IMF/World Bank week in Washington.\n\nThree development experts \u2013 Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer \u2013 have jointly won the Nobel Prize in economics for their original approach to alleviating global poverty.\n\nMr Banerjee and Miss Duflo \u2013 a team both at work and in private \u2013 are professors at MIT.\n\nInstead of just pouring money into, say, primary education, they test different learning systems in a scientific way using the kind of techniques deployed by big pharma.\n\nIt could make foreign aid look a less contentious way of spending taxpayer funds.", "description": "You have to admire the sublime confidence of Sajid Javid and the Boris Johnson government.
