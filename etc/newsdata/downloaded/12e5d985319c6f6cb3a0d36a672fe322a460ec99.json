It was during this period that Type R's were born.\n\nRace cars for the street\n\nHonda has been producing engines for bikes, lawnmowers, and generators, but that all changed in 1992 when the NSX was the first model to be emblazoned with the red 'R' emblem.\n\nREAD | Golf R, Civic Type R, Megane RS...

Their latest local offering on the Type R front is the FK8 Civic that produces 228kW from its 2.0-litre turbocharged engine, the first ever forced-induced offering in the Civic and Type R's history.\n\nImage: Newspress\n\nBut nobody hears the words Type R anymore like we used to, and that is probably largely down to the fact that the brand has scrapped speed in favour of economy. Fuel-sipping models like the Amaze and Jazz are now leading the line along with its collection of SUV and compact offerings.\n\nBuyers are looking elsewhere to appease their craving for speed whereas Honda used to be the benchmark for this specific topic.\n\nThe FK8 is the only Type R offering available in SA and even so it is unattainable for most with a price tag of just under R600 000 brand new back in 2017. Golf's R and Ford's ST is considerably cheaper, proving a better option for buyers.\n\nI've been lucky enough to see the DC2, DC5, EK9 and EP3 in the flesh, and my word is it a sight and sound to behold. You are given a stark reminder of why these cars carry such a strong racing heritage.\n\nMaybe Honda will attach the red 'R' to other models in the future, but for now we have to be fortunate enough to be able to drive a piece of racing history, albeit now sporting a turbo.", "description": "The Type R name is synonymous to Honda's high-revving, high-performance engines made famous in models like the Civic and NSX back in the 90's.
