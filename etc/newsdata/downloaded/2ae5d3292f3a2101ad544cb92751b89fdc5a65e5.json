Brands YUM, -0.62% chain quietly pulled about 2.3 million pounds of seasoned beef from restaurants in 21 states over concerns that it was contaminated with metal shavings.\n\nTaco Bell revealed in a press release on Tuesday morning that the reason why the tainted meat was voluntarily removed and discarded from locations across the eastern Midwest, northern Southeast and Northeast regions was because a customer reported finding a metal shaving in their food. The contaminated meat was traced back to one plant location on only one of the two lines used to make the seasoned beef, which was sent to distribution centers in Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Virginia.\n\nGetty Images for Taco Bell Shredded beef, cheese -- and metal shavings?\n\n\u201cNothing is more important than our customers\u2019 safety, and nothing means more to us than their trust,\u201d said Julie Masino, Taco Bell Corp. president in North America, in the release. \u201cAs soon as we received the first consumer complaint, we immediately acted to remove the product from the affected restaurants and proactively worked with the supplier to inform the USDA of our steps to protect our guests.\u201d\n\nRelated: Taco Bell hotel reservations sell out in two minutes\n\nThe USDA has had no confirmed reports of any customers falling ill or suffering adverse reactions from consuming beef laced with metal from Taco Bell. It added in the Taco Bell release that anyone who suspects they\u2019ve suffered an injury or illness from eating any of the brand\u2019s menu items should contact a healthcare provider.\n\nBut customers were largely left in the dark about the recall over the weekend, which left a bad taste in many of their mouths. Some took to Twitter TWTR, +0.13% to complain about the mysterious beef shortages at their local Taco Bell restaurants.\n\nHey @tacobell can you guys be real about what\u2019s going on with your beef. I love eating there and the secrecy of what\u2019s going on makes me afraid to ever eat at your restaurant again \u2014 ICUrn (@jeff_serenks) October 14, 2019\n\njust went to taco bell in niles and they said they were all out of beef chicken and tortillas... pic.twitter.com/IfHX4LLtOW \u2014 taryn \u10e6 (@taryn_kolesar10) October 12, 2019\n\nThis is the latest beef that customers have had with the brand. The chain also reported a tortilla shortage over the summer, stemming from a supply issue, which meant it was missing an essential ingredient to wrap its signature quesadillas and burritos.\n\nRead more: Taco Bell confirms it\u2019s experiencing a tortilla shortage at some locations\n\nAnd in June, a Louisiana taco lover actually called the police to complain about their local Taco Bell running out of taco shells. The Slidell Police Department shared the \u201cwe can\u2019t make this stuff up story\u201d on Facebook FB, +3.52%. The post noted that \u201cwhile this is truly a travesty, the police can\u2019t do anything about this. Hopefully, they are replenished in time for Taco Tuesday!\u201d", "description": "The Yum!
