Several other US opera houses have canceled concerts featuring him because of the sexual harassment allegations.\n\nThe \u201cKing of Opera\u201d has responded that \u201call my interactions and relationships were always welcomed and consensual.\u201d\n\nHighlighting international fault lines in the #MeToo scandal, Domingo\u2019s career has continued to thrive in Europe even as it is imperiled in the United States.\n\nHe performed to a chorus of bravos this summer in Austria and Hungary, and has upcoming concerts in Zurich and Moscow.\n\nIn his video message, Domingo said he hoped to travel to Mexico soon and perform a concert to celebrate six decades since his debut at the capital\u2019s Palacio de Bellas Artes.\n\nThe Batuta, which organizers hope to make an annual prize, will be awarded to 16 honorees including British composer Michael Nyman, Mexican soprano Maria Luisa Tamez and Mexican conductor Enrique Batiz, who is himself facing sexual assault allegations.", "description": "Mexico City (AFP) \u2013 Placido Domingo was honored Saturday with Mexico\u2019s Batuta prize but the Spanish tenor was absent from the ceremony amid a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/44202b_domingo-is-accused-by-20-women-forcibly-kissing-grabbing-or-fondling-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
