Moscow denies that.\n\nOn Monday, Putin gave the clearest idea yet of his pitch to African countries, warning of rising competition over Africa. Turning the tables on the West, he accused it of intimidating African countries to exploit the continent's resources.\n\n\"We see how an array of Western countries are resorting to pressure, intimidation and blackmail of sovereign African governments,\" Putin told the TASS news agency.\n\nHe did not name specific countries, but said he was referring to former colonial powers on the continent.\n\n\n\n\n\nARMS FAIR\n\n\"They are using such methods to try to return lost influence and dominance in their former colonies in a new guise and rushing to pump out maximum profits and to exploit the continent,\" he said.\n\nBy contrast, Putin said Russia was ready to offer help without \"political or other conditions\" and to embrace the principle of African solutions for African problems.\n\nDuring its Cold War struggle with the capitalist West, Soviet Moscow developed close ties with many African countries, backing for instance post-colonial independence movements. Many of those ties lapsed after the 1991 Soviet breakup.\n\nBut Moscow's ties to Africa are now on the up, Putin said, pointing to military technical cooperation accords that Russia has with more than 30 African states which it supplies arms to.\n\nRussia's new role in the region was thrust into the spotlight in July last year when three Russian journalists were killed in the Central African Republic while investigating the alleged presence there of a shady Russian private military contractor known as the Wagner group.\n\nPutin will co-host the summit with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nRussia plans to put on an arms fair at the summit, showing Russian-made weapons including its S-400 missile defence system, other air defence systems as well as non-military equipment, according to the Almaz-Antey arms manufacturer.\n\nIn trade terms, though, Moscow lags far behind competitors. Russia says its trade with African countries rose to $20 billion last year, but Russia did not rank among the continent's top five largest trade in goods partners, according to Eurostat.\n\nThat list was topped by the European Union, followed by China, India, the United States and the United Arab Emirates.
