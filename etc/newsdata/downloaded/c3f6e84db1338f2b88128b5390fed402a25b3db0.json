This has been much more consistent with global inflation and yet provides the flexibility as well.\"\n\nQIC chief economist Matthew Peter said the central bank's original mandate to achieve the inflation target was protected by independence.\n\n\"In the 1980s, they had a mandate from the government to tackle inflation even though it meant you were going to slow the economy down.\n\n\"It was important they had the independence because they were going to make decisions that weren't positive in other aspects of the economy. I don't see it's any difference today.\"\n\nThis means that the question the Reserve Bank board has been asking itself when making interest rate decisions is how those decisions can best contribute to the welfare of the Australian people.\n\nOn Tuesday Dr Lowe mentioned that his board had considered concerns about how persistently low inflation could hurt people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is possible that, in some circumstances, a low and stable inflation environment provides fertile ground for the emergence of some financial stability risks.\n\n\"As we have seen too often, the crystallisation of these risks can have very large welfare consequences, with people losing their jobs, their incomes and their savings.\"\n\nBut Westpac's Bill Evans said the key management task for Dr Lowe was people's expectations.\n\n\"What they don\u2019t want is inflation expectations to fall. It\u2019s a matter of managing expectations and therefore you need to be seen to be doing something next year if you're still well below your target.\n\n\"If you do nothing people think you've accepted a lower profile.\"", "description": "If Australia treated inflation the same way our most similar economies of Canada and Norway did then the Reserve Bank may not have had to cut interest rates three times this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/195e16aa1068ee9cb3936bba01d3520916a6686e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
