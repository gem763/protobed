You felt you had to show faith in him.\u2019\n\nHis parents spoke to him about aerosol misuse, Ms Blake said. Jack\u2019s mother found him unresponsive in his bedroom on June 13 and found an aerosol can on his bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the efforts of paramedics he died at his home in Main Street, Hockwold, Norfolk.\n\nA post-mortem examination recorded his medical cause of death as aerosol inhalation.\n\nMs Blake said that the pathologist did not find any volatile gases in Jack\u2019s lungs but that they \u2018just dissipate because of the way the body reacts after death\u2019.\n\nShe said that breathing in the gases from aerosols can \u2018jolt\u2019 the heart, and that the damage caused is to the heart rather than the lungs.\n\nMs Blake said: \u2018I think it\u2019s more likely than not he used the aerosol and unexpectedly died.\n\n\u2018They say people get a high from it. I don\u2019t know. It used to be glue sniffing in my day. It\u2019s the thing in aerosols that makes the gas spray that does the damage.\u2019\n\nShe concluded that he died by misadventure, where a deliberate action has an unintended consequence.\n\nAddressing his parents who attended Thursday\u2019s hearing, she said: \u2018He would have gone into cardiac arrest and he wouldn\u2019t have known anything. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. You don\u2019t expect to bury your children.\u2019\n\nMrs Waple told the coroner: \u2018He was very adventurous and would do things like he had learnt off the internet like making a cake in a cup, and making his own ice cubes which are still in the freezer in plastic bags with kiwi fruit in.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis father Robert Waple, who works as a chef, said that Jack \u2018loved experimenting with things\u2019.\n\nHe said Jack was prone to nosebleeds and Ms Blake said this could explain blood found on Jack, as the post-mortem examination recorded no signs of haemorrhaging or external damage.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
