The two of them were having drinks at the hotel bar when Lauer dropped by. After six shots of vodka, Nevils went to Lauer\u2019s hotel room twice. The first time was to retrieve her press pass, the second was at Lauer\u2019s invitation. According to Farrow, Nevils said she \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.\u201d\n\nVariety, who received an advance copy of the book, describes the alleged rape thusly:\n\nOnce she was in his hotel room, Nevils alleges, Lauer \u2014 who was wearing a T-shirt and boxers \u2014 pushed her against the door and kissed her. He then pushed her onto the bed, \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cShe said that she declined several times.\u201d According to Nevils, she \u201cwas in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested again when he \u2018just did it,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cLauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She tells him yes. She claims that \u201cshe bled for days,\u201d Farrow writes. Nevils tells Farrow: \u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nDue to her fear over the power Lauer had to help or hurt her career, Nevils admits she embarked on a consensual sexual affair with Lauer.\n\n\u201cThis is what I blame myself most for,\u2019\u201d she told Farrow. \u201cIt was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.\u201d\n\nHere is where things get sticky for NBC News\u2026\n\nAfter she stopped seeing Lauer, Nevils told Farrow she \u201ctold like a million people\u201d what had happened with her and Lauer. \u201cShe told her colleagues and superiors at NBC,\u201d and after she switched jobs, she \u201creported it to one of her new bosses there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was no secret,\u201d Farrow writes.\n\nStill, \u201c[n]othing happened until fall 2017, when the post-Harvey Weinstein reckoning led former Today colleagues to ask her about Lauer,\u201d Variety writes. This prompted her to tell Vieira, who told Nevils to hire a lawyer and go to NBC\u2019s human resources.\n\nAnd this is when Matt Lauer was unceremoniously fired from the top-rated morning show on television.\n\nVariety goes on to lay out why this is such a problem for NBC News:\n\nAfter Lauer\u2019s firing, she learned that Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, and Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, \u201cwere emphasizing that the incident hadn\u2019t been \u2018criminal\u2019 or an \u2018assault\u2019\u201d \u2014 which she claims caused her to throw up, Farrow writes. \u201cNevils\u2019s work life became torture,\u201d according to Farrow. \u201cShe was made to sit in the same meetings as everyone else, discussing the news, and in all of them colleagues loyal to Lauer cast doubt on the claims, and judgment on her.\u201d And though Nevils had been promised anonymity by human resources, Lack saying internally that the encounter had happened at Sochi limited the possibilities of complainants \u2014 and soon, everyone knew it was Nevils. Though Nevils had not wanted money, she went on medical leave in 2018, and was eventually paid, Farrow writes, \u201cseven figures.\u201d \u201cThe network proposed a script she would have to read, suggesting that she had left to pursue other endeavors, that she was treated well, and that NBC News was a positive example of sexual harassment,\u201d Farrow writes.\n\nThere is also the matter of the deliberately misleading statement Lack released after firing Lauer, which transformed an allegation of \u201canal rape\u201d into \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, after Lauer was fired, story after story came out confirming what Farrow says in his book, that Lauer\u2019s sexual misconduct was no secret in the news division.\n\nIn December of 2017, an insider told the New York Post that \u201ccomplaints\u201d about Lauer\u2019s sexual misconduct date all the way back to when Jeff Zucker, who now runs the far-left CNN, was in charge of the Today Show.\n\nCatch and Kill comes out next week and will cause a separate set of headaches for the left-wing outlet. According to Variety, Farrow finally tells the whole sordid story about how he had the goods on movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, but NBC News refused to run the story. As Breitbart News previously reported, Farrow\u2019s reporting included audio tape of Weinstein appearing to admit he groped a model, a bombshell news story by any measure, but still NBC refused.\n\nWhy would NBC refuse such an opportunity? Well, we also learned that the aforementioned Oppenheim, no less than the president of NBC News, is an ambitious screenwriter who had recently attended an event with Weinstein.\n\nIncredibly, NBC News ended up sending Farrow and his story down the road to the New Yorker, where the investigative reporter would win a Pulitzer for his Weinstein expos\u00e9.\n\nFarrow\u2019s reporting also launched the #MeToo movement, a movement that exposed the left-wing institutions of Hollywood and the news media as dens of sexual abuse, cover ups, and enablers willing to look the other way.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
