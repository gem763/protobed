It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today.\n\nBut, yesterday was the 4th sideways day after last week\u2019s gap up. Also, the ledge top on the daily and weekly charts is a magnet below. Any gap down this week will create an island top on the daily chart. What is not clear is whether the Emini will test down to below the top of the ledge or go directly up to a new all-time high. The probability for each outcome is 50%.\n\nOvernight Emini Globex trading\n\nThe is up 3 points in the Globex session. Traders are still deciding if last week\u2019s breakout will succeed or fail. Yesterday\u2019s late reversal up helps the bulls, but they need more.\n\nThe past 4 days have been trading range days. Traders will expect the trading range price action to continue again today.\n\nHowever, since the daily chart is in Breakout Mode, day traders are ready to swing trade up or down. They know that the odds of a big trend day up or down are increasing.\n\nIt will probably begin early in the day. Day traders will therefore look for a strong buy or sell signal and a strong early breakout up or down. If they see that, they will swing trade, betting on a strong trend day.\n\nBut if the open is unclear for an hour or more, as has been the case for 4 days, they will expect another trading range day.\n\nYesterday\u2019s setups", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Al Brooks covering: S&P 500 Futures.
