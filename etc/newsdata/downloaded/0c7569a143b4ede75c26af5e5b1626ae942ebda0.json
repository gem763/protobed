With those rebuttals likely to focus on which CNN personnel, if any, might aptly be described as fair and balanced themselves.\n\nMaybe Wolf? I can\u2019t recall any examples of Wolf Blitzer launching into a furrowed-brow monologue about Trump on the air over the past two and a half years. When you watch Wolf, you know what you\u2019re getting \u2014 a merry-go-round of various correspondents reporting remotely from the Hill and in-studio panelists sounding off, with Blitzer acting as a nervous-sounding emcee whose job is to keep the show moving. He\u2019s sort of the Ed Sullivan of CNN. Not going to win any Pulitzers but not going to get on your nerves either.\n\nPretty slim pickings beyond him, though. Maybe they can grab someone who\u2019s currently unemployed to bring a little impartial journalism to CNN?\n\nCNN president Jeff Zucker suggested that he\u2019s interested in hiring former Fox News anchor Shepard Smith when he\u2019s able to join a new company. Smith abruptly departed the network on Oct. 11, and, due to the nature of his contract, won\u2019t immediately be able to take a new job. \u201cI think Shep\u2019s a great journalist,\u201d Zucker said at the network\u2019s Citizen conference on Thursday afternoon. \u201cWhen he\u2019s available, he is somebody who is very talented and I would be very open to talking to him.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re snickering at me calling Shep an \u201cimpartial\u201d journalist given his obvious disdain for Trump, but given the leanings of the current CNN anchor corps, his addition really might tilt the network marginally towards the center on average.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not like he has a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against Trump like Jeff Zucker allegedly does.\n\nAnyway, whenever you see Jeff Zucker grousing about Fox, two facts should be borne in mind. One: Clearly his complaints about Fox mostly have to do with its slavish apologetics for Trump. It\u2019s not a news organization, he claims, it\u2019s a propaganda outlet. And everyone understands on whose behalf it\u2019s propagandizing. But here\u2019s the second fact: Arguably no one in the world, including Roger Ailes, did more to help create a Donald Trump presidency than Jeff Zucker did. After all, before Zucker was head of CNN he was the man at NBC who elevated New York tabloid curio Donald Trump to the status of one of America\u2019s greatest businessmen in the public\u2019s imagination by creating \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d The image of Trump as a commanding manager who\u2019d settle for nothing less than excellence was largely a product by that show. Jeff Zucker\u2019s show. Then, after Trump launched his presidential candidacy, Zucker promoted him relentlessly again by having CNN devote hours of airtime to his rallies. Whether Fox News did more to enable Trump in 2015-16 than Zucker did in his two roles at NBC and CNN is a debate I\u2019d love to see settled somehow, but for now it\u2019s enough to say that the irony of Zucker complaining about other people\u2019s Trump mythmaking is neck-deep.", "description": "\"I think it's morphed into conspiracy TV.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/z-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
