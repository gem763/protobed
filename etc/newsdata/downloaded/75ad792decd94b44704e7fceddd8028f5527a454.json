In a 42-person blind taste-test encompassing 36 omnivores and six people who identify as vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian, Choice tested nine beef burger patties and mince alternatives. The highest rated scored just 66%.\n\nExcluding Quorn and other explicitly vegetarian products, they focused only on products sold alongside regular meat in the supermarket\u2019s chilled section that are meant to look, cook and taste like meat. For all test products, the first ingredient \u2013 other than water \u2013 had to be a vegetable protein.\n\nI\u2019m paranoid it\u2019s meat\u2019: the rise of vegan conspiracy theories Read more\n\nThese scores were made up of a combination of tester-reported taste and nutrition, based on the products\u2019 health star rating, with taste making up 70% of the score. Taste-testers were encouraged to give products they loved a score of 100, products they liked a score of 70 and products they disliked a score of 25.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty poor to terrible, to be honest,\u201d says Ashley Iredale one of the omnivorous taste-testers. \u201cThe smell and taste for a few of them were pretty appalling, and there was a very interesting texture with some of them. I\u2019d say it fell into what you\u2019d consider the uncanny valley. They tried really hard to make these things look and feel like meat, but they\u2019re just not quite there.\u201d\n\nBianca Jamett, who has been a vegan for more than 15 years, and a vegetarian for more than 20, was more impressed with the fake meats tested. \u201cSome of them were stand out. But some were totally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A taste-tester assessing plant-based meat alternatives for Choice.

It was a little freaky because I wasn\u2019t expecting it.\u201d\n\nAlthough all the products tested were highly processed, the meat-substitutes fared better on health than flavour. Six of the nine products tested scored 80% on health. However, many were high in sodium. One burger patty contained 638mg of sodium \u2013 around 40% of Nutrition Australia\u2019s suggested dietary target for sodium intake. Some of the fake meats tested also had significant quantities of saturated fat. The levels of sodium are comparable to meat-based supermarket burgers, which are also higher in saturated fats.\n\nVegan products sold in supermarkets loaded with unhealthy amounts of salt Read more\n\nMince alternatives fared especially poorly in the tests, with the highest rated product attracting a score of just 51%.\n\nIredale says the worst of the lot was \u201cnot something I would even consider edible, it tasted that bad\u201d. He also noted that, during testing the cooking smells were so overwhelmingly unpleasant \u201cour kitchen lab crew [were] having to take turns while cooking one of them, because they all had to keep running away from the pan to gag.\u201d\n\nAll of the products cost more than meat-based mince and burger patties \u2013 with the most expensive patties costing $5.29 per 100 grams \u2013 while supermarket brand beef patties cost around $1.30 per 100 grams.\n\nWhile Jamett is no stranger to fake meat \u2013 she occasionally eats fake ham and \u201canything that\u2019s fake chicken-ish\u201d, she does not think fake beef will become a more regular part of her diet. \u201cI think the range was OK, but it\u2019s a lot of money to spend on these things. I think half the time you can probably make something just as good as some of the products there.\u201d", "description": "Supermarket vegan patties and minces fall short on flavour, according to consumer advocacy group Choice", "authors": ["Alyx Gorman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac7fcb7d80e3604e6704d4f1272c468078a5f94/257_336_2481_1489/master/2481.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f94250a38f1331992ca13506c148f02e", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
