Apple TV+ will launch Nov. 1, and Disney's service will launch two weeks after that.\n\nBritton's comments Friday follow news that Disney is banning ads from competitor Netflix on all of its TV platforms except for ESPN.\n\nBritton said he didn't think that would be a major setback for Netflix's business, outside of the Oscars \"where they can't run ads.\"\n\n\"But besides that, there's plenty of other places for them to capture customers,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Britton said Netflix faces other headwinds. Yes, Netflix has great content, Britton said, but that is accomplished mainly through \"writing checks.\"\n\nBut \"companies like Apple and Amazon have deeper checkbooks, and they have a thriving direct-to-consumer base,\" Britton said.\n\nBritton said Apple has a strong ecosystem in the home, with iTunes and Apple TV, \"which I think is incredibly powerful.\" Amazon also has a strong existing presence through Prime, Britton said.\n\n\"For consumers, you get free shipping on your Amazon products and you can pay for the subscription, where Netflix you just get the content,\" Britton said. \"So that's why I think it's really hard for them to compete because they were first to market, but as these competitors come in, I think it's going to be hard for them to hold their ground.\"\n\nNetflix could gain stronger footing by controlling a piece of hardware that helps distribute its content, Britton argued.\n\n\"I think you need the whole stack, so to speak,\" he said.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.", "description": "Suzy CEO Matt Britton says Netflix or other content providers should buy a TV maker to gain an advantage in the streaming wars.", "authors": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105267113-GettyImages-866643100.jpg?v=1553268849", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
