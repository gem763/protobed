Joe Maddon, the ex-Chicago Cubs manager, is reportedly meeting with the Los Angeles Angels on Monday.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman of MLB Network, Maddon is the Angels\u2019 top pick and the Angels are Maddon\u2019s. He spent 31 years in the Angels organization as a player, minor-league manager, big-league coach, scout and various other duties. It would be a grand homecoming for Maddon, who then went on to manager the Tampa Bay Rays and Cubs.\n\nSources: Joe Maddon interviews with the #LAAngels today. Word is, he\u2019s their top choice, and they are his top choice. Things look lined up for a Maddon/Angels marriage. \u2014 Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) October 7, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOther reports were quick to clarify that the Angels intend on talking to other candidates \u2014 four of them, in fact \u2014 but Maddon is indeed the favorite. There are plenty of other managerial jobs open too, with the San Diego Padres and New York Mets being among the most alluring.\n\nJoe Maddon will be the first of four candidates to interview this afternoon for the #Angels managerial opening. Maddon is the favorite but no decision will be made until all four candidates have interviews in Anaheim. \u2014 Bob Nightengale (@BNightengale) October 7, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nMaddon was fired on the final day of the season after a disappointing Cubs season in which they didn\u2019t make the postseason. The Angels fired their manager Brad Ausmus the next day, who had been in the job just one season. The Angels maintained that firing Ausmus had nothing to do with Maddon\u2019s availability, but it would be a surprise if the Angels opted to hire anyone other than Maddon.\n\nJoe Maddon is reportedly the favorite to be the next Angels manager.
