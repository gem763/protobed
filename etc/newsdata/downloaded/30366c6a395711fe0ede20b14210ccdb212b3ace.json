But those punitive measures didn\u2019t suffice. Members of the House and Senate will weigh parallel bills, possibly as early as Wednesday, that would in addition target the American assets of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and suspend U.S. military support for a NATO ally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who is leading the congressional sanctions effort alongside Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), described Trump\u2019s initial moves, which included higher steel tariffs, as a \u201cpathetic response\u201d to Turkey\u2019s invasion. \u201cSteel exports to the U.S. are only 4 tenths of 1% of Turkey\u2019s exports,\u201d tweeted Van Hollen. \u201cAnd while Trump \u2018talks\u2019 about sanctions on Turkish officials, he still plans to meet Erdogan next month. Congress must stay the course and enact tough sanctions that impact Turkish conduct.\u201d\n\nDespite U.S. sanctions, Turkey forged ahead with its military offensive in northern Syria https://t.co/XIJKjjupjf pic.twitter.com/rVty0DdDD2 \u2014 Reuters Top News (@Reuters) October 15, 2019\n\nAs Washington Post columnist David Ignatius observed, Trump\u2019s initial acquiescence to Erdogan and his decision to fully withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria \u2014 where they were helping protect a de facto autonomous Syrian Kurdish state \u2014 has infuriated myriad U.S. officials in the military, diplomatic and intelligence communities, all of whom are aware of the thousands of Kurdish lives lost in the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dagger to the heart to walk away from people who shed blood for us,\u201d one former top CIA official told Ignatius. \u201cIt will go down in infamy,\u201d said an Army officer who served in the Syria campaign. \u201cThis will go down as a stain on the American reputation for decades.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis sense of outrage is not only felt in Washington. The Canadian Foreign Ministry announced that it was at least temporarily suspending new weapons sales to Turkey on Tuesday, warning in a statement that Ankara\u2019s \u201cunilateral action risks undermining the stability of an already fragile region, exacerbating the humanitarian situation and rolling back progress\u201d achieved by the anti-ISIS coalition.\n\nSome European powers have already done the same. On Monday, European Union member states collectively pledged to suspend arms exports to Turkey \u2014 though they stopped short of implementing a formal bloc-wide embargo. But various countries, including Germany, France, Finland and Sweden, had enacted embargoes of their own by the weekend. Britain followed suit on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is not the action we expected from an ally,\u201d said British foreign secretary Dominic Raab, referring to Turkey. \u201cIt is reckless. It is counterproductive and plays straight into the hands of Russia, and indeed the Assad regime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUPDATED LIST OF ARMS EMBARGO TO TURKEY\n\n\n\n\u2014 NATO allies\n\n\u2022 Italy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\n\n\u2022 France \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\n\n\u2022 The Netherlands\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\n\n\u2022 Norway \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4\n\n\u2022 Germany \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\n\n\u2022 Britain\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\n\n\u2022 Czechia \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddff\n\n\n\n\u2014Non-NATO\n\n\u2022 Finland \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee\n\n\n\n\u2014 ALSO\n\n\u2022 EU \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa made a call to all member states to suspend arms exports to Turkey \u2014 Rag\u0131p Soylu (@ragipsoylu) October 15, 2019\n\nErdogan is not a popular figure in the West, where many governments view his increasingly autocratic rule to be corroding Turkish democracy. But the speed with which other governments came crashing down on Ankara struck others as somewhat curious.\n\n\u201cWestern powers unleashed a wave of sanctions against Turkey over its Syria incursion,\u201d tweeted Ragip Soylu, Turkey correspondent for the Middle East Eye. \u201cNONE of them wanted to [do] the same when Saudi Arabia massacred thousands in Yemen, murdered [journalist Jamal] Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nThe juxtaposition is worth considering. For years, Saudi Arabia has led a ruinous campaign against Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. Airstrikes on critical infrastructure and a maritime blockade contributed to the collapse of Yemen\u2019s already impoverished economy. The bleak conditions led to one of the world\u2019s worst cholera epidemics while possibly more than half of the country remains in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. Moreover, U.N. investigators suggested in September that the Saudis \u2014 and perhaps the Americans, British and French allies who armed them \u2014 could be guilty of potential war crimes over the course of the conflict.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet none of the mounting anger over the multiyear war in Yemen that has been voiced by Western civil society and various lawmakers has translated into the same sweeping political action that a few days of Turkish incursions provoked this week.\n\nThere may be understandable reasons for this double standard. Turkey is a NATO member and a nominally democratic nation that\u2019s still seen in a different light than an opaque gulf monarchy. The besieged Syrian Kurdish faction that Turkey views as a \u201cterrorist\u201d group played a vital role in securing Western strategic interests in Syria \u2014 unlike the Iran-linked Houthis. And the Saudis remain big customers: In 2017 alone, E.U. countries granted licenses to export arms to Saudi Arabia worth close to $19 billion.\n\nFor all the Western antipathy toward Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Turkish president still seems to loom as a larger boogeyman. In Europe, Erdogan is widely seen as the dangerous demagogue next door. In the United States, he has become an adversary in allied clothing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cObsession with Erdogan has always distorted Turkey policy in Washington,\u201d Soner Cagaptay, author of \u201cErdogan\u2019s Empire: Turkey and the Politics of the Middle East,\u201d told Today\u2019s WorldView.\n\nIn the early years of his reign, Erdogan was the toast of Western capitals, hailed as an epoch-redefining liberal who was shaking up the Turkish state still dominated by an overweening military and an asphyxiating civil bureaucracy. \u201cBecause people so firmly believed that he was going to make Turkey democratic, they overlooked his democratic transgressions,\u201d Cagaptay said, pointing to earlier purges Erdogan\u2019s government carried out against political opponents.\n\nNow, though, Erdogan is reviled, especially by the American foreign policy establishment. And so Washington \u201cdistorts Turkey\u2019s policy in the other direction,\u201d said Cagaptay, seeing only the mustachioed would-be autocrat in Ankara, while ignoring widespread concerns, shared by many of Erdogan\u2019s domestic opponents, over the dangers of a Syrian Kurdish statelet emerging on the Turkish border.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurkey\u2019s incursions have now made its fraught relationship with the United States the focus of conversation in Washington. Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly headed to Ankara for crunch talks over a possible cease-fire and way forward.\n\nIn an op-ed published this week in the Wall Street Journal, Erdogan sniped at his critics both in the West and the Arab world, arguing that he was cleaning up a mess that others had a hand in making. \u201cThe international community missed its opportunity to prevent the Syrian crisis from pulling an entire region into a maelstrom of instability,\u201d wrote Erdogan, insisting that his government\u2019s new campaign would \u201crestore peace and stability.\u201d\n\nA legion of critics would disagree, pointing to reports of new atrocities, the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians, and fears of the resurgence of the Islamic State. But in a part of the world where regional powers pay little price for causing such havoc, Erdogan\u2019s gambit may end up being once more par for the course.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
