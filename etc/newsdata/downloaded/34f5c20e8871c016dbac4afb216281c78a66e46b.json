And can he and Robert truly face a life on the run?\n\nBecause of everything that Aaron stands to lose \u2013 including a normal life with sister Liv (Isobel Steele) and mum Chas (Lucy Pargeter) \u2013 Robert made the ultimate sacrifice and gave himself up to police, who arrested him for killing rapist Lee Posner.\n\nBut Aaron can\u2019t face up to life without his soulmate and is not about to give up. Viewers have already seen him making a call to a contact to try and engineer a jailbreak but when Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) gets wind of the shocking plan, he intervenes to stop Aaron throwing his life away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Paddy stands in his way and refuses to let Aaron out of the house, it remains to be seen whether he can stop Aaron doing something stupid. But it has already been confirmed that Robert will take the stand in court and be sentenced for his crime.\n\nFans are in bits as it is almost certainly the end of the road for the popular couple Robron, with Robert almost certainly set to be sent down for years. Danny Miller is sticking around in the soap as Aaron, who will hit rock bottom after losing Robert.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Monday 21st October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Aaron has a risky plan.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/robert-sugden-and-aaron-dingle-in-emmerdale_1571651072.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
