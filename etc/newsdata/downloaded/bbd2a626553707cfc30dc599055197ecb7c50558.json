The Kenyan government sent tribal elders into Somalia, where authorities believe they are being held, to negotiate for their release in May. The elders returned saying the al-Shabaab jihadis responsible for the kidnapping wanted a $1.5 million ransom.\n\nThe Cuban government refused to pay it and has not overtly done much since to retrieve them, though it has insisted that a successful rescue operation requires discretion and that it would not negotiate with terrorists.\n\nThe Cuban media outlet ADNCuba recalled on Tuesday, observing the 200-day mark, that communist state television has not mentioned the case in over two months, when the head of the Cuban medical delegation to Cuba appeared to demand international cooperation to save the two doctors. Cuban officials have also not answered what security precautions they have taken to prevent a similar abduction from happening, as Havana sent 100 doctors to Kenya this year to help offer services in some of the nation\u2019s most remote areas.\n\nIn July, Cuban health officials issued a statement vowing they would guarantee the safety of the doctors. The leftist propaganda outlet Telesur claimed that Cuba at the time \u201ccontinues to ensure the safe return\u201d of the doctors but did not offer any information on whether the doctors were safely returning.\n\n\u201cThe Cuban government has not ceased for a moment in the efforts and negotiations for the safe return \u2026 of the kidnapped doctors,\u201d Cuban Minister of Public Health Jose Angel Portal Miranda said at the time. The minister said he was in contact with the parents of the two doctors and other relatives in Cuba.\n\nThe latest news on the doctors comes from Nairobi, not Havana, where a police officer who responded to the terrorist attack that resulted in the abduction testified before a magistrate court on his experiences. The officer was serving as a guard and told the court, according to Kenya\u2019s The Nation, that the doctors had expressed concerns with their driver, now believed to have played a role in the kidnapping.\n\n\u201cAfter about five kilometers, while in town, a [Toyota] Probox overtook us and blocked us, four men came out,\u201d Constable Ramadhan Barua, the testifying officer, said. \u201cImmediately the Toyota Probox overtook us, our driver stopped, pulled the handbrake and opened his door to escape.\u201d\n\nGunfire ensued and the attackers captured the two doctors. The driver has been identified as Issack Ibrein Robow and is facing both terrorism and illegal immigration charges, as he did not appear to have a legal right to enter Kenya.\n\nDiario de Cuba noted this week that, with the exception of the testimonies this week, the Kenyan government has offered little new evidence of the status of the doctors or the negotiations to free them. In September, a Kenyan government spokesman said that Nairobi had set in motion \u201celaborate plans\u201d to save the doctors, but did not offer any more information.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we are concerned and feel for the families,\u201d Cyrus Oguna, the spokesman, said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that such an incident had to happen, but we are doing everything we can to bring them back alive.\u201d\n\nAl-Shabaab is a jihadist organization affiliated with al-Qaeda and operative mainly in remote areas of Somalia, where it has attracted growing international attention from the global jihadist movement. The most recent reports on the Cuban doctors suggest they are being kept in Jubaland region, Somalia, and being used as doctors to treat injured jihadists.\n\nAt the time of the doctors\u2019 abduction, Mariela Castro, daughter of dictator Ra\u00fal Castro and head of the communist government\u2019s \u201cNational Center for Sex Education,\u201d blamed the United States for the doctors\u2019 kidnapping.\n\n\u201cI think this is another one of Imperialism\u2019s schemes,\u201d Castro wrote on Twitter, referring to the nefarious \u201cAmerican Imperialism\u201d that the regime has branded its paramount nemesis. \u201cThe Islamic State responds to them, but they have gotten into a swamp by kidnapping Cuban doctors.\u201d\n\nAl-Qaeda has a frosty relationship with the former al-Qaeda in Iraq, now known as the Islamic State, so experts do not believe ISIS collaborates with al-Shabaab. The United States is responsible for the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and \u201ccaliph\u201d of the Islamic State.\n\nRodr\u00edguez and Herrera were in Kenya as part of Cuba\u2019s multimillion-dollar slave doctor scheme, believed to generate over $11 billion for the regime a year. Cuba sends hundreds of doctors to developing nations around the world for a fee, but does not pay the doctors a salary. Instead, the doctors receive a meager \u201cliving stipend\u201d that many who have escaped the system say is not enough to live a decent life in the countries they are serving.\n\nThe slave doctor program is highly unpopular in Kenya. The nation\u2019s medical union unsuccessfully petitioned to keep the doctors from working in the country, arguing that too many native Kenyan doctors do not have jobs and that paying them directly would be cheaper than paying the Castro regime for slaves.\n\nIn September, the Kenyan government ordered a new \u201cmentorship\u201d program after finding that the Cuban doctors did not have sufficient medical training to safely practice. The program would require Kenyan doctors to evaluate and teach the imported doctors to prevent malpractice, which many protested proved the Cuban deal was of little benefit to the country.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Kenya marked the end of 200 days since the abduction of two Cuban slave doctors by jihadists into Somalia.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1136454798-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
