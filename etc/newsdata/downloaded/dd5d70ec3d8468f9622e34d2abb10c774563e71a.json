Nevils said she had six shots of vodka and wound up going to Lauer\u2019s room.\n\nShe said that Lauer pushed her onto a bed and asked if she liked anal sex. Nevils said she declined several times, but then Lauer \u201cjust did it.\u201d She described the encounter as \u201cexcruciatingly painful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d Nevils told Farrow. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Lauer admitted to his extramarital affair with Nevils. He said on that night in Sochi that they consensually performed a variety of sexual acts.\n\n\u201cShe was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe claimed they had an affair that lasted after they returned to the United States. Nevils described the sex as \u201ctransactional\u201d and that she feared the effect Lauer could have on her career. In one case, she told Farrow that she had asked Lauer for help recording a goodbye video for a friend leaving NBC. He told her he\u2019d do it in his office, and then demanded oral sex, Farrow wrote in the book, \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\nNevils said she felt she had to do something to protect other women at NBC News, leading to her filing the complaint against Lauer in November 2017.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time,\u201d NBC News said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nNBC said then that Lauer had been fired for \u201cinappropriate sexual conduct.\u201d The specific rape allegation did not become public until Variety reported Wednesday that Nevils spoke to Farrow.\n\nNevils grew disenchanted with NBC, feeling bosses there weren\u2019t doing enough to protect her anonymity internally and mischaracterizing the relationship with Lauer as an affair. After some rough times - she said she was hospitalized for post-traumatic stress and alcohol abuse - she left NBC with a seven-figure settlement.\n\nNBC Chairman Andrew Lack, in a memo sent to network staff on Wednesday, said the network hadn\u2019t known of Lauer\u2019s behavior with Nevils until the day before he was fired. An internal investigation uncovered no claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired, Lack said.\n\nBut Farrow indicated that Lauer\u2019s behavior was an open secret at NBC. He quoted Lauer\u2019s former co-anchor Ann Curry - who left \u201cToday\u201d on bad terms with Lauer - saying she had told NBC executives that Lauer \u201chad a problem with women\u201d and they had to keep an eye on him.\n\nFarrow said he\u2019d learned of seven claims of sexual misconduct raised by women who worked with Lauer. \u201cSeveral said they had told colleagues, and believed the network knew about the problem,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe quoted a former production assistant, Addie Collins, who told him Lauer aggressively pursued her in 2000 and \u201cordered\u201d her to perform sexual favors. \u201cShe\u2019d consented, but it had made her feel sick, afraid for her job, afraid of retaliation,\u201d Farrow wrote.\n\nLauer said that he had never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex.\n\nIn his letter, he said he ended his relationship with Nevils \u201cpoorly,\u201d but that \u201cbeing upset or having second thoughts does not give anyone the right to make false accusations years later.\u201d\n\nHer lawyer did not return a message for comment Wednesday on Lauer\u2019s letter.\n\nLauer acknowledged other extramarital encounters, and criticized the women involved for having \u201cabandoned shared responsibility\u201d for the affairs to shield themselves from blame behind false allegations.\n\n\u201cThey have avoided having to look at a boyfriend, a husband or a child in the eye and say, \u2018I cheated,\u2019\u201d Lauer said. \u201cAnd I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d\n\nThat statement is chilling and could be read as a threat by women who feel they are victims of Lauer\u2019s misconduct, said Linda Vester, a former NBC News employee who formed Silence Breakers Alliance, which tries to direct foundation spending for programs that combat sex abuse.\n\nLauer\u2019s letter was called \u201cunbelievable\u201d by Eleanor McManus, who co-founded the group Press Forward to support victims of sexual misconduct in the new industry. McManus said she was harassed by journalist Mark Halperin, who lost jobs at NBC News and elsewhere because misconduct allegations.\n\n\u201cLauer\u2019s statement demonstrates not only his lack of remorse, but his lack of understanding of sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement,\u201d McManus said. \u201cNowhere in his letter does Lauer acknowledge the power he yielded as a celebrity and the star of NBC\u2019s highest-rated show. The two people in the hotel room in Sochi did not have equal power.\u201d\n\nNevils\u2018 story was reported Wednesday on the show Lauer hosted for two decades. His former co-host, Savannah Guthrie, called it shocking and appalling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disturbed to our core,\u201d Guthrie said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two years after Matt Lauer was abruptly fired by NBC News for sexual misconduct, more questions are emerging about the former \"Today\" show host's behavior and whether bosses looked the other way at problems involving one of the network's biggest stars.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Bauder"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/sexual_misconduct_lauer_87008_c0-152-2584-1658_s1770x1032.jpg?284d4cfed3784c36981d4a804a5c1c55667696ec", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
