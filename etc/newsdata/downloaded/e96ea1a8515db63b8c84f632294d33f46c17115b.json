The reality is you pick up an injury.\n\n\u201cFor four years we have talked about winning the World Cup with Eddie and I have led that group, been a part of that journey, so to fall at the final hurdle \u2026 I wake up most nights thinking about it. It doesn\u2019t sit well with me but I have come to terms with it. You have to crack on. But it\u2019s just shit.\u201d\n\nHartley, who captained England from 2016 until being injured and has 97 caps for his country, said he still holds out faint hopes of again playing for England. But he admitted the chances are slim to nonexistent.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dylan Hartley in London this week.\n\n\u201cI genuinely think England, they\u2019ve got as good a chance to go and do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst thing for me is to think if my leg wasn\u2019t fucked at the moment I could be there with them, winning a World Cup. It\u2019s hard to swallow, really. I hope they go and win.\u201d\n\nA smiling Hartley added: \u201cI\u2019ll get on and be a glory supporter: \u2018Remember me guys?\u2019 In my headspace, I am still kind of hoping to be involved, but the reality is I am not going to be unless there are a couple of horrific injuries.\u201d\n\nHartley said his injury had been aggravated by a rigorous push to prove his fitness but he understood the need for tough deadlines to be set by the England management team. \u201cI tried a very aggressive approach, because I was given some deadlines to meet, and it did not work,\u201d he said. \u201cI basically ended up in a worse position for trying to come back too early. I tried getting back for the start of the camps in July and basically put myself in a bit of a hole physically and mentally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019s the way it goes. Other people have missed out, mine\u2019s not a special story. I am no different to Devin Toner, Owen Franks with the All Blacks or the other guys in the England team that did not go. It\u2019s a highly competitive animal is sport, especially rugby. The game moves fast \u2013 it doesn\u2019t wait. I can understand why there were deadlines. The team needed to prepare and, if I can\u2019t physically help them to prepare, I can understand why I wasn\u2019t needed.\u201d\n\nJonny Wilkinson: \u2018It took a few years for the pressure to really build. And then it exploded\u2019 | Andy Bull Read more\n\nHartley said he would like to ban playing professional rugby on artificial pitches, having injured his knee on Worcester\u2019s artificial grass in December. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d played the fortnight before and I\u2019d tweaked my knee in a game, then I played on an artificial pitch the following week and probably playing on an injury didn\u2019t help. If there\u2019s a platform to show my support for getting rid of artificial pitches, it\u2019s here. It might be suited to under-10s or under-12s but from a personal point of view I don\u2019t like them.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hartley insisted he had no plans to retire and believes he is back on track to play again for Northampton after spending his family\u2019s holiday budget flying to Philadelphia to see Bill Knowles, a world-class reconditioning expert who has worked with Andy Murray.\n\n\u201cI had a chance encounter with Eddie at Wimbledon [and he] suggested it,\u201d he added. \u201cI spent a fortnight out there, spent the family\u2019s holiday money. This guy is world-renowned, the best going. It was one-on-one for four or five hours a day. It is intense. I felt like I was not progressing how I wanted to before going out there. It has given me a nice little springboard to slowly go on the up.\u201d\n\nDove Men+Care is an official partner to England Rugby.
