Every minute of the day I feel like I\u2019m teetering on the brink of mind-numbing, chest-constricting, lung-crushing panic. (Although the shortness of breath can probably also be attributed to being eight months pregnant.) It feels like I\u2019m losing control of my life, watching it all just pass me by, and no matter how much I want to do something about it, I can\u2019t.\n\nThere are three main stressors at the moment:\n\n1. My first child is due in less than two months. Those of you already with kids will probably understand that even I, an anxiety-ridden wreck with an obsessive need to plan for everything, feel underprepared for the monumental upheaval ahead. My partner and I have sorted out all the essentials: where baby is going to sleep, how we\u2019re going to transport baby around, whether we\u2019re going to breastfeed or use bottles, and we\u2019ve got all the relevant bits and bobs sorted out. What we haven\u2019t done is actually collected any of said bits and bobs, because we simply don\u2019t have the space to store them until they\u2019re needed. Which brings me onto point number 2:\n\nRelated:\u200b The Epiphany My Panic Attack Gave Me About Letting Things Go\n\n2. We have nowhere to live. Well, we\u2019re staying in my parents\u2019 storage room for now. But it\u2019s really a two bedroom house they\u2019ve squeezed a sofa bed into the storage room of, and with five grown adults occupying said two bedroom house, it\u2019s a bit of a squeeze. Add a baby into the mix in two months and\u2026 well. You can\u2019t. There\u2019s just no room. So naturally, my partner and I are looking for a new place to live, with all the stresses that come with that. We are working on finding somewhere without too much of a commute for work, on a good public transport route for the non-driver (me), where we can afford the rent (let alone the bills) and sorting out references and credit checks and all of the background tenancy stuff. It\u2019s a hassle and a half.\n\n3. I started a new job less than two months ago. I love it \u2013 this isn\u2019t one of those posts where I\u2019m going to complain about my job for longer than you can stand to read, because I honestly find my job so rewarding. I\u2019m a nursery nurse, working with preschoolers, and my favorite thing in the world is coming into work and listening to all the stories the kids have to tell me. Unfortunately, I\u2019m also a person with crippling social anxiety around people my own age, figures of authority and anyone over school age in general. So after a rocky start my stress and anxiety got so bad I had to be signed off by the doctor. And that\u2019s the crux of things, really.\n\nRelated:\u200b If Your Anxiety Is Like an 'Overprotective Friend,' This Comic Is for You\n\nI\u2019m ashamed. I\u2019m ashamed I couldn\u2019t hold it together for longer at work. I\u2019m ashamed I went to the doctor for an intimate health issue and forgot to ask for a repeat prescription of my antidepressants at the same time. I\u2019m ashamed I ran out of my medication and spiraled so badly and so rapidly I couldn\u2019t bring myself to go back and ask for more, making everything worse. I\u2019m ashamed I cry at the drop of a hat \u2014 even without the extra pregnancy hormones. I\u2019m ashamed my fear of rejection and abandonment (my primary struggles with borderline personality disorder) means I\u2019m incredibly sensitive to criticism, actual or perceived. This means that even general meetings with senior staff and bosses are my literal nightmare because I feel like every slightly negative thing they say, to anyone, is a deliberate and personal attack on me. I\u2019m ashamed because every time I ask my boyfriend \u201care you mad at me?\u201d \u2014 at least ten times a day \u2014 he has to reassure me that no, he\u2019s not, and he\u2019s not lying or diminishing his own feelings, either. I\u2019m ashamed because I know my fears are irrational, but I believe them anyway. I\u2019m ashamed to ask for help, to need help at all.\n\nRelated:\u200b How My Constant Perfectionism Takes Over My Life\n\nAnxiety is something I\u2019ve been dealing with for seven years, and it\u2019s still the skeleton in my closet. The bogeyman under my bed. The elephant in the room, that I don\u2019t acknowledge and push away until all the feelings I\u2019ve bottled up explode and I can\u2019t ignore it any more. My panic attacks feel like a bomb going off \u2014 a sudden, debilitating attack of paranoia, crying so hard I can\u2019t breathe and unable to talk and explain why I am suddenly breaking down in the middle of the staff room on my ten-minute morning break. And that\u2019s if I\u2019m lucky; more than once it\u2019s happened in the actual room in front of the children, which is a whole other kettle of fish. The more often these attacks happen, the more I worry about how unprofessional they must look. The worry makes my anxiety worse, and the vicious cycle just carries on and on.", "description": "A woman living with borderline personality disorder is feeling stress about being pregnant, looking for a permanent living situation and her new job.
