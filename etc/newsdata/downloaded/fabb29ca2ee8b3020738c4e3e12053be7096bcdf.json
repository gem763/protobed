There was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\u201d\n\nAn FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s email use resulted in no charges, although FBI Director James Comey alleged at an unusual news conference in July 2016 that Clinton and her staff were \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d\n\nClinton allies have bitterly complained about Comey\u2019s statement as a breach of Justice Department protocol. A Justice Department inspector general review backed up that view.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s internal security review prompted concern among some former Clinton aides and current State officials that it could amount to an effort to alleviate pressure from Clinton critics who were disappointed that no one was prosecuted over the emails. Some also said it could be an attempt to strip the security clearances of former Clinton aides and allies.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is among those who have pressed the State Department to investigate whether any aspect of the private-server fiasco should result in discipline for State employees or revocation of security clearances.\n\nGrassley\u2019s office released the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's report publicly on Friday. A Grassley spokesman had no comment on State\u2019s findings.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton did not respond to a request for comment, but former Clinton aide Philippe Reines said it is time for Grassley to let the issue go.\n\n\u201cGet over it, Chuck,\u201d Reines said.\n\nThe State report asserted that information on Clinton\u2019s server was at \u201cincreased risk\u201d of being compromised because it wasn\u2019t hosted on official systems.\n\n\u201cThe use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks,\u201d the report said.\n\nThat finding seems open to dispute because while Clinton was secretary, State\u2019s official, unclassified email system was repeatedly breached by Russian intruders, according to officials. Cybersecurity officials became so concerned that Russia had compromised the official system that it was at one point shut down for a weekend to try to rid it of viruses and digital taps.\n\nWhile Clinton\u2019s server may have theoretically been more vulnerable, there is no solid proof it was ever compromised.\n\nThe new report is vague about the outcome of the 91 security violations and how, if at all, they affected individuals\u2019 security clearances. Some other episodes were deemed to be \u201cinfractions,\u201d which typically result in no action unless there are at least three such instances, the report said.\n\nThe report noted that none of the messages in question was marked as classified, which led to questions about whether the sender or recipient should have known the information was classified. The investigators also pointed to significant ambiguity about what sort of \u201cforeign government information\u201d should be treated as classified and what could be shared in unclassified systems.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ae/34/ea4ac8414aa08f856ce6c96f3075/190418-hillary-clinton-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
