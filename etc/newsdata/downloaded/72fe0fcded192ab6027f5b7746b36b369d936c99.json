Walter Jones (R), who passed away in February.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race with 44 percent of precincts reporting. Murphy had 59 percent of the vote while his opponent, Democrat Allen Thomas had 44 percent of the vote.\n\nMurphy was expected to win the district, which leans heavily Republican. Jones had served 13 terms in the district and President Donald Trump won the district by 23 points in 2016.\n\nFrom Roll Call:\n\nMurphy finished first in a 17-way primary in April but failed to win the nomination outright. He advanced to a runoff against pediatrician Joan Perry, who had the support of outside groups dedicated to electing GOP women. The political arm of the House Freedom Caucus backed Murphy in what became a proxy war between competing D.C. interests. North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the vice chairman, campaigned for him in the district. Murphy used their backing to help convey his support for Trump.\n\nMurphy will become a member of the House Freedom Caucus, which is an invite-only caucus of conservatives.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter to celebrate the news:\n\nOne down, one to go \u2013 Greg Murphy is projected to win in the Great State of North Carolina! #NC03 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nAnother special election is taking place on Tuesday in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, where Republican state Rep. Dan Bishop is facing off against Democrat Dan McCready. President Trump stumped on behalf of both Murphy and Bishop ahead of Tuesday's election.", "description": ".09/11/2019 3:24:44AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/253/4f9b3bca-bc7b-4899-97c5-25c60b3b795f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
