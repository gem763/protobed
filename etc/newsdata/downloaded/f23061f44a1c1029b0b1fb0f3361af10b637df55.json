REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nTakeaway.com and internet giant Prosus PRX.AS, both based in the Netherlands, are vying to buy Just Eat, with Prosus last week unveiling an unsolicited $6.3 billion offer in cash, or 710 pence per share. Just Eat, which had already agreed in August to an all-share offer from Takeaway, rejected the new bid.\n\nHowever, a 13% slide in the value of Takeaway\u2019s shares since Aug. 30 has reduced the value of the Takeaway bid from an original 731 pence a share to 594 pence.\n\nGerman food delivery company Delivery Hero finds itself tangled up in the battle since it is part owned by Prosus and is in turn an investor in Takeaway.\n\nJust Eat shareholder Cat Rock on Monday alleged that Delivery Hero, which is 22% owned by Prosus, had been selling down its 13% stake in Takeaway shares to keep them artificially suppressed and lower the attractiveness of Takeaway\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cDelivery Hero structured its share sales in a bizarre and uneconomic fashion that seems deliberately intended to depress Takeaway.com\u2019s stock price in the run-up to the shareholder vote on a merger with Just Eat,\u201d which is scheduled for Dec. 4, Cat Rock said.\n\nDelivery Hero said it \u201ccategorically\u201d rejected that claim.\n\n\u201cThe decision to sell down Takeaway.com shares was taken by Delivery Hero\u2019s management board independently in September 2019,\u201d its statement said.\n\n\u201cDelivery Hero had no knowledge of Prosus\u2019s contemplated offer to acquire Just Eat.\u201d\n\nBefore Prosus\u2019s bid was announced, Delivery Hero had detailed plans to sell 3 million of its 8 million shares in Takeaway.\n\nProsus, spun off last month from South Africa\u2019s Naspers (NPNJn.J), declined to comment.\n\nSeparately on Monday, Takeaway asked Delivery Hero (DHER.DE) to withhold from voting its remaining shares on Dec. 4, for or against the merger with Just Eat (JE.L), saying it had a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cDelivery Hero\u2019s own market position as well as Prosus\u2019 position as the largest shareholder in Delivery Hero ... gives rise to a conflict of interest,\u201d Takeaway.com said in a statement.\n\nA Delivery Hero spokesman said on Monday the company would not comment on how it plans to exercise its voting rights in Takeaway.\n\nCat Rock, which owns roughly 3% of Just Eat, as well as 5.6%, of Takeaway, said it did not oppose Prosus\u2019s offer in principle but it is too low.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to consider fair offers from Prosus and any other interested buyers, but these offers must compete on a level playing field,\u201d Cat Rock said.", "description": "The takeover battle for British food delivery ordering service Just Eat heated up on Monday as a key shareholder accused German peer Delivery Hero of undermining one of the two rival offers.", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445842740&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0ZC", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
