'Hopefully everything will be sorted properly by UEFA.\n\n'I am really proud to see the boys stick together. In those situations where they say they would walk off the pitch it is right because no player should be treated differently.\n\n'Gareth (Southgate) is the manager, we always have to stick by him. He makes the decision. It is all up to the manager and the captain.\n\n'It is a captain decision but also a team decision. So we all have a say in what's happening.\n\n'If the manager says we stay on the pitch, we stay on the pitch, try to cope with it as players and we make the decision all as a team.\n\n'If we think it is right and we can focus and carry on playing then we do that. If not and the manager says something different then we do what the manager says.'\n\nThe 18-year-old scored twice for the U21s as they defeated Austria 5-1 in Milton Keynes\n\nAidy Boothroyd lauded the 18-year-old for returning sharper following a five-month absence with an achilles injury.\n\nHudson-Odoi has impressed over his two games with the Under 21s and is likely to make a senior return next month.\n\n'I definitely think I can improve. I am not a perfect player,' he added. 'I say to myself, keep going, keep working hard and hopefully more opportunities will come.\n\n'I just need to get up to speed and get my fitness back. I think once that happens gradually my dribbling and everything will come back to what it was. Now I am feeling a bit more confident to get on the ball and do my stuff.'\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie Nketiah, following his England Under 21 hat-trick against Austria, has sent a message to Marcelo Bielsa in a quest for games on loan at Leeds.\n\nBulgaria have been charged by UEFA after their fans racially abused England players in Sofia\n\nA fan holds up a No Respect jumper, rubbishing UEFA's Respect campaign for equality\n\nNketiah has yet to start a Championship game for Leeds so far this season and is itching to prove his worth.\n\n'It's been disappointing for me not to start in the league - I went there to play games and get games,' the 20-year-old Arsenal forward said.\n\n'It's still early days. I think every time I've come on a done well and shown why I should be playing.\n\n'I feel like I probably haven't been given the chances I would have liked. I'm still one of the top scorers - if not the top scorer - in the team, with such limited time so I don't think I could do much more than that.\n\n'I think the Austria game was a good statement and a good way for me to put across a performance and hopefully I'll be starting in the next run of games. I believe I'm good enough to be playing in the team.'", "description": "Callum Hudson-Odoi would walk off a pitch if he was subjected to racist abuse, providing that was a universal decision with his team-mates and manager.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19804798-0-image-a-15_1571256198458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
