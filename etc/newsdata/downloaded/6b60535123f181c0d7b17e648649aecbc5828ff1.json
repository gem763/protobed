(Photo: Facebook/Alaska State Troopers)\n\n\n\n\n\nA 12-year-old girl received a heroism award from the police department for calling 911 and parking a car when her mom had a seizure behind the wheel.\n\nMelaniah Andrade, 12, saw that her mother Nicole Johnson wasn\u2019t herself during a shopping trip to Target on the evening of September 29. \u201cShe kept picking up random things like a knife set and putting them in the cart,\u201d Melaniah of Wasilla, Alaska tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI kept asking her why and she wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\nBy the time the mother and daughter returned to the parking lot, the tween was feeling scared. \u201cShe kept staring at nothing and wasn\u2019t really talking to me,\u201d says Melaniah.\n\nJohnson was having an \u201cabsence seizure\u201d which the Mayo Clinic states involves \u201cbrief, sudden lapses of consciousness.\u201d The 42-year-old single mom says she doesn\u2019t recall what happened in the car but attributes the seizure to breast cancer, with which she was diagnosed 9 years ago, that\u2019s metastasized to her brain. During the seizure, Johnson tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cI was on autopilot and not processing anything.\u201d\n\nAfter Johnson drove out of the parking lot, she alternated between speeds of 60 and 20 mph, says Melaniah, and when Johnson started calling her own daughter \u201cMom,\u201d the tween called 911.\n\nWhile Johnson drove, Melaniah gave the operator their address. In the 911 call obtained by local news station KTUU, the girl tearfully says, \u201c...I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on...\u201d\n\nMelaniah turned on the hazard lights, as instructed by the operator, and Johnson turned onto a dead end street, accelerating toward a tree. The car then hit a patch of grass and Melaniah removed her mother\u2019s foot from the pedal, putting the car into park and removing the keys from the ignition.\n\nEMT workers and state troopers arrived and Johnson was hospitalized for three nights. \u201cWhen I heard the 911 recording, I grasped how amazing Melaniah was in the situation,\u201d the mom tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI also felt guilty.\u201d\n\nThe following week, Alaska State Troopers gave Melaniah a plaque for her \u201coutstanding efforts...in which you called 911 for a medical emergency while remaining calm.\u201d And Melaniah received a basket filled with snow gear, gift cards, and a police coin and a sew-on badge.\n\nJohnson says her daughter is \u201cstrong and independent\u201d but all the attention has been slightly embarrassing for the tween. \u201cIt was scary and crazy,\u201d Melaniah tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cand something we can all learn from.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hero Biker Saves Girl Having Epileptic Fit While Stuck in Thai Traffic Jam\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The 12-year-old called 911 when her mother was behaving strangely during a trip to Target.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1B99Pjt98HBxi2iyhYM21Q--~B/aD0xMjkzO3c9ODUyO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/eb4bc760-f2c2-11e9-89bb-4a20088676d4", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
