He started badly and got worse, eventually being replaced by Firmino after 78 minutes. That 12-minute cameo only aggravated Firmino\u2019s groin further, ruling him out of the return leg at Anfield.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He played no part in the 4-0 turnaround at Anfield, remember. But after a goal, assist and masterful performance in the 3-0 victory at Burnley on Saturday, Klopp admitted that Liverpool would have to do things differently if not for the Brazilian.\n\nThere is no other player at the club with the same vision, composure and spatial awareness in that central striker role. In fact, there are few comparable in Europe.\n\n\u201cI know one or two but I don\u2019t want to say their names,\u201d Klopp said in a back room at Turf Moor on Saturday night, before slightly reconsidering his answer, given Firmino\u2019s sheer range of abilities.\n\n\u201cBeing skilled like Bobby is one thing. Mix it up with the attitude he puts in, that\u2019s unbelievable. Skill-wise, being there, passing in between and stuff like that, for sure there are some players. Not really a lot but some. But to mix those? Wow, it\u2019s exceptional.\u201d\n\nFirmino\u2019s work is often said to go unappreciated \u2013 so often that, if anything, the opposite is now true \u2013 but he largely escaped scrutiny for a 2018-19 campaign that underwhelmed at times, falling below his usual standards.\n\nMoving to a deeper position as part of Klopp\u2019s switch to a 4-2-3-1 in the early part of last season did not help, though form and fatigue were just as much of an issue.\n\nA return of 16 goals and 8 assists was good by most measures, but not for a player of Firmino\u2019s ability in an attack as prolific as Liverpool\u2019s, and particularly not when compared to 27 goals he scored and 17 he set up the previous year. \u200b\n\nFirmino\u2019s 5.52 xA was lower than the likes of Alex Iwobi, Nathan Redmond and Gylfi Sigurdsson, while Ashley Barnes and Aleksandar Mitrovic ranked better in xG.\n\nBut four games into Liverpool\u2019s faultless start to the new season, he appears to be back to his very best. See, for instance, the glorious swivel and volley in the opening game against Norwich City and his nonchalant look towards the bench when the attempt was saved.\n\nWatch his angled finish against Southampton a week later, having dodged the attention of several defenders, or the ridiculous flick, scoop and shot which nearly sent Dani Ceballos back to the Real Madrid substitutes\u2019 bench.\n\nAnd then at Turf Moor on Saturday, there was Firmino doing what he has always done best: pressing high, asking questions of opponents in possession and turning defence into attack.\n\nBen Mee will rue his misplaced pass which led to the second goal, but he was forced into it by Firmino\u2019s presence. It came minutes after Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross had looped in off the back of Chris Wood, but for this second goal, Liverpool had made their own luck.\n\nThat is what Firmino brings that Salah, Man\u00e9, Divock Origi or indeed Wijnaldum do not. Liverpool will need all that tenacity over the next nine months if they are to go one better than last year domestically and win the Premier League title.\n\nTwo years ago, in his debut year, Salah was Klopp\u2019s outstanding performer. Last season, Man\u00e9 stepped up to the plate. Perhaps this year, the third member of Liverpool\u2019s attacking triumvirate will prove why he is just as irreplaceable.", "description": "It took an evening of acting as Roberto Firmino\u2019s\u00a0deputy for one of his team-mates to fully appreciate just how important he is to Liverpool.
