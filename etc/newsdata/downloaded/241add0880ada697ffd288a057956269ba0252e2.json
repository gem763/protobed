Tobias Oliver, who started the season-opening blowout at Clemson, was back under center but lost one fumble at the Temple 1-yard line and another that resulted in a 74-yard touchdown return.\n\nJames Graham, who missed The Citadel game with a foot injury, completed 10 of 24 passes for 100 yards and an interception. Oliver was the team\u2019s leading rusher, gaining 68 yards on 11 carries.\n\nHeading into Saturday\u2019s game against North Carolina (2-3, 1-1), it\u2019s unclear who will start at quarterback, but perhaps it doesn\u2019t matter. Collins has used all three in the same game three times and is more adamant about discussing the program\u2019s culture rather than dwell on who\u2019s first to man a position.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing on average 27 to 30 players on each side of the ball, which is a lot,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably 11 to 12 DBs that play every single game.\u201d\n\nGraham, a redshirt freshman, has shown the ability and eagerness to throw deep and might be called on to do so again if the Jackets fall behind early against North Carolina, which is coming off a near-upset of then-No. 1 Clemson.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be a lot of patience with a young guy like that who has a really good understanding of who he is athletically, but sometimes he\u2019s like a wild stallion,\u201d offensive coordinator Dave Patenaude said. \u201cHe\u2019s all hyped up. You can\u2019t play quarterback like that. It\u2019s got to be one play, go to the next play, go to the next play.\n\n\u201cOnce he settles down and is really more comfortable in what we\u2019re doing, I think he\u2019ll be dynamic.\u201d\n\nOliver has been pressed into duties as a return specialist, but Patenaude expects him to contribute plenty at QB against the Tar Heels. He leads the Jackets with 264 yards rushing and 441 yards of total offense.\n\n\u201cTobias is an elite level guy, and you can see when he gets out of the pocket, he\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Patenaude said. \u201cHe threw the ball well moving out of the pocket. He runs the ball tremendous, but he had a little hot feet and he was a little antsy in there throwing the ball in the pocket.\n\n\u201cJames will stand and deliver. He wants to throw the ball. Sometimes he wants to throw the ball deep every time. We have to get that straightened out a little bit.\u201d\n\nWilliam Lay, who took over at center when Cooper was injured at Temple, is likely the first man up even though he\u2019s yet to earn a scholarship.\n\nBall security was stressed hard in practice Sunday. The Jackets used a drill in which ball carriers had to hold on tightly.\n\n\u201cGuys were stripping at it,\u201d Patenaude said. \u201cWe\u2019re whacking at them with bags. Coaches are screaming at them to put them in a chaos type of deal.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Georgia Tech hasn't been able to catch a break on offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/georgia_tech_struggling_offense_football_04169_c0-114-2770-1729_s1770x1032.jpg?0e7341385d4e2e3dac9abb9c9ddbb0d53fdf0b15", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
