That is, learning doesn\u2019t stop, it\u2019s iterative, builds on itself, and enhances capabilities through time.\n\n\u201cThere is an ongoing rate of learning required by our teams to help us better unlock insights from patterns in data and make high-quality decisions. This is not an overnight process and requires deliberate leadership focus to sustain learning and facilitate feedback from our teams to help us continuously improve,\u201d Raniga said.\n\nAs one of the first manufacturers in the world to deploy Microsoft\u2019s 365 product, Majans is clearly a leader in digitisation both here and across the globe.\n\nEqually though, in putting together a process that allows the continuous learning, recognising the importance of leadership, and the culture that supports its teams, the company is utilising the road map Australia\u2019s most innovative companies use to stay competitive.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank\u2019s latest National Business Insights Report (NBIR) gives a window into the changes that Majans is making with staff and their tasking as well.\n\nWriting at Business Insider Adam Bennett, Group Executive Business and Private Banking at Commonwealth Bank said one of the key findings of the NBIR is \u201cthat technology is more likely to lead to staff being deployed into higher-value areas of the organisation than it is to replace them\u201d.\n\nResearch like the NBIR shows that this change generates the kind of positive feedback loop which drives employee engagement and higher productivity for the business. That\u2019s ultimately a win-win for all stakeholders and is likely to deliver a better product and experience to customers.\n\nAnd that, at the end of the day, is one of the key drivers of digitisation.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
