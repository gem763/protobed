Of course I would - but I don't want to take away from the fact that is quite considerable movement,\" he said.\n\nThe leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said the vote showed ordinary members coming behind the Labour leader's stance in a show of loyalty.\n\n\"What you've seen here is a massive show of support for Jeremy Corbyn,\" he said, adding that it was \"time to unite\".\n\nThe vote was decisive - the Labour leadership position on Brexit triumphed.\n\nThose calling for a more robust Remain stance at the likely snap election were defeated.\n\nBut the manner of the triumph was immediately called in to question.\n\nThe vote wasn't a secret ballot, it was a show of hands.\n\nCalls for a card vote - where the vote of each delegate is individually counted in secret - were dismissed by the chair.\n\nThat's not to say there wasn't clear show of support for the leadership.\n\nBut some remainers maintain that the vote would at least have been closer if it wasn't conducted in public.\n\nThat's because the debate became - for some delegates - a demonstration of support for the leadership, close to an election, rather than a pure test of opinion on Brexit.\n\nThe conventional wisdom was that Jeremy Corbyn might have to rely on the big unions - with 50% of conference votes - to win.\n\nBut some unions chose to defy him, making a defeat possible.\n\nIn the end a section of the grassroots - the ordinary members - did not prioritise their own pro-remain position and rallied round Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nRemainers are now accentuating, for them, the positive - that the party is now unambiguously backing a new referendum, with Remain as an option.\n\nNonetheless, Labour will go in to the election unable to say whether it will officially back leave or remain in a subsequent referendum.\n\nBut after a difficult few days, most of those close to Jeremy Corbyn are relieved tonight, and some are jubilant.\n\nAndrew Lewin, the founder of Remain Labour, said the vote represented the \"grassroots against the party machine - and the machine won\".\n\n\"If this fudge is the Labour policy at the next general election, we will drive Remain voters away.\"\n\nAnother campaigner, Michael Chessum, from Another Europe is Possible, said: \"Labour members, 90% of whom want to stay in the EU, will be deeply disappointed with this decision.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Labour's stance on Brexit has dominated the conference\n\nBut Labour MPs remain divided over the issue.\n\nSpeaking before the vote, shadow Treasury minister Annaliese Dodds said the economic consequences of Brexit were \"so severe\" that she believed Labour must back remain in another referendum.\n\n\"Is it going to be easy?\" she told the BBC's Carolyn Quinn. \"No it is not, because people are passionate in both directions.\"\n\nBut Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon, told a fringe meeting organised by the Social Market Foundation that Labour had had \"more Brexit positions than the Karma Sutra\".\n\nDescribing the first two days of conference as an \"utter shambles\", he said Labour should have stuck with its 2017 manifesto pledge to honour the referendum result and moving away from this this would not go down well in Leave constituencies.\n\n\"Our position on Brexit is being treated with ridicule on the doorsteps in my constituency,\" he said.\n\n\"We could end up passing three contradictory motions and then it would be up to those writing the manifesto to decide. Good luck with that.\"\n\nNew policies\n\nAway from Brexit, Labour has announced a pledge to introduce free personal care in England for over-65s, so they will not have to pay for help with dressing, washing and meals.\n\nIn his speech, Mr McDonnell also pledged to end in-work poverty within five years and to move to a four day, or 32-hour, working week within a decade without any cut to pay.\n\nThese are the latest of several new policies likely to feature in the party's next election manifesto, including pledges to:", "description": "Members at the party's annual conference vote against a motion which would have called for remain backing at an election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p3xh6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
