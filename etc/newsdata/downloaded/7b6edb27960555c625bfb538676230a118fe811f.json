USA TODAY\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- A steady rain and water-logged field may have hampered the efforts of the New England Patriots as they hosted the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. But the conditions did nothing to derail the most dominant defense in the league, and the Patriots prevailed 27-13 to improve to 8-0 while dropping the Browns to 2-5.\n\nA three-takeaway first quarter set the tone for another commanding outing by New England\u2019s defense.\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 defense entered Sunday\u2019s game with 22 takeaways (seven more than the Carolina Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers, who were tied for second), and they emerged with three more, leaving them only four away from surpassing last year\u2019s season total of 28.\n\nHere are three things we learned from New England\u2019s victory:\n\n1. Brady remains the face, but the defense is the backbone - You can\u2019t think, \u201cPatriots\u201d without images of Tom Brady flashing through your mind. But the juggernaut defense is the reason why this New England team remains undefeated and is still the favorite to win yet another Super Bowl.\n\nRain did factor into a disjointed passing attack, but even so, the Patriots still very much are figuring things out on offense. They can run the ball, and Julian Edelman remains Brady\u2019s favorite target after catching two touchdowns on Sunday. But they\u2019re still waiting for someone else to fill that void left by Rob Gronkowski\u2019s retirement.\n\nMohamed Sanu made his Patriots debut, but with only a few days of practice in this system, he was non-factor. Phillip Dorsett flashes, but vanishes at times as well. New England struggled on third down, going 5-for-16, but it didn\u2019t matter, because their defense did such a great job against the Browns.\n\nThere\u2019s no panic within the organization because another eight weeks of tinkering lie ahead for the Patriots, and more importantly, because of the defense. There\u2019s no shortage of play-makers on that side of the ball, and their ability to generate turnovers helps ease the pressure on the offense. A Dont\u2019a Hightower fumble recovery gave New England its first touchdown of the game, and a Jonathan Jones forced fumble shortly after kept the Browns off of the board. Only a few snaps later, a Lawrence Guy interception on a Baker Mayfield shovel pass set up the Patriots' offense for a touchdown two plays later. The effectiveness of the defense enabled the Patriots to take a methodical, run-heavy approach on offense, and they didn\u2019t have to force anything. The Patriots very likely will have things figured out offensively by the time December rolls around. But for now, they\u2019ll continue to lean heavily on their defense while stacking additional wins.\n\n2. Chubb the Browns' lone bright spot - Cleveland\u2019s offense struggled to find an answer against that disruptive Patriots defense, and the only thing that did work was handing the ball off to running back Nick Chubb. The second-year back\u2019s two fumbles loomed large, but after the first quarter, he did a better job of protecting the football and had one of his most prolific days of the season (20 carries for 131 yards). The Patriots entered the game limiting foes to 74.7 rushing yards per game.\n\nUnfortunately for the Browns, however, the Patriots always seemed to buckle down when it mattered most. They limited Mayfield, who didn\u2019t look comfortable all night long, to 20-for-30 passing for 194 yards, a touchdown and an interception, and they made Odell Beckham Jr. (five catches, 52 yards) and Jarvis Landry (five catches, 65 yards) look very average. The Browns just couldn\u2019t come up with a way to counter-punch. They tried jet sweeps and other misdirection plays, quick-hitter passes and down-field throws, but none of it mattered because they couldn\u2019t pinpoint a weak spot in New England\u2019s defense.\n\n3. Waiting for a challenge - Sunday's win\u2014the 300th of Bill Belichick's career\u2014represented the seventh time in eight games that the Patriots have defeated an opponent by double digits and the sixth in which they have held a team to fewer than 14 points. Outside of the Buffalo Bills' 16-10 loss in Week 4, no team has managed to really threaten the Patriots' perfect mark, leaving many to wonder when New England will finally receive a legitimate challenge.\n\nTheir Week 9 opponent, the Baltimore Ravens, could make things interesting because of the dual threat that Lamar Jackson presents. Then the Patriots will have their bye, before returning in Week 11 with a game at the Philadelphia Eagles. The Dallas Cowboys will visit Foxborough the following week, but the Week 13 and 14 matchups\u2014at the Houston Texans and at home against the Kansas City Chiefs\u2014could offer the biggest tests for this squad. But again, given the way their defense is playing, it\u2019s hard to comfortably pick anyone to upset the Patriots.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones and listen to the Football Jones podcast on iTunes.", "description": "The New England Patriots scored their fourth defensive touchdown of the season in another stout performance against the Cleveland Browns.", "authors": ["Mike Jones", "Published P.M.
