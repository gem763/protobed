The local alternative is not quick.\n\nThe first of new submarines to be built in Adelaide won't be ready for service until the mid-2030s, despite the fast changing strategic landscape. Other critics point to the uncertainty and potential flaws of a new design adding to costs and complexity.\n\nThe eye-watering cost certainly puts into perspective Philip Lowe\u2019s admonitions about spending more on infrastructure. The building program alone is worth $90 billion \u2013 with continuing maintenance costs typically two to three times that figure.\n\nThen prime minister Malcolm Turnbull was surrounded by a large contingent of Liberal politicians at the $35 billion frigates announcement. AAP\n\nBut the government stresses this is all about transforming Australian industry as well as the navy. Not that the old ASC is really the builder. Its role is largely confined to deep maintenance of the older Collins class submarines, either in South Australia or Western Australia. The Commonwealth is still to make a decision, although political pressure from the crossbench means Adelaide is firming as a favourite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, it was the British-based BAE Systems that won the contract for the nine anti-submarine warfare frigates. The French-owned Naval Group won Australia\u2019s largest defence contract, giving it the right to build 12 submarines for the Australian Navy for $50 billion. German-owned L\u00fcrssen is building 12 offshore patrol vessels, starting at Osborne and moving to Henderson in Western Australia, in a joint venture with Australian-based Civmec.\n\nDomestic nomenclature remains politically sensitive, however. So , BAE Systems Australia, for example, now has a subsidiary confusingly still called ASC Shipbuilding \u2013 as opposed to ASC (submarine corporation).\n\nASC Shipbuilding is officially responsible for the frigate project as well as supplying the workforce for the first two offshore patrol vessels until the frigate construction can begin. Naval Group will set up a separate subsidiary in Australia.\n\n'The valley of death'\n\nThe plan is to co-opt international design and construction expertise to have a local build radically improve industry capacity and workforce skills. This includes a continuous building program to avoid the traditional Australian stop-start shipbuilding known as \u201cthe valley of death\u201d \u2013 the inability to provide a constant supply of work. It's also about being involved in the constant evolution of technology.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting the impact on a direct Australian workforce of thousands and smaller local businesses being encouraged to bid as part of the ongoing supply chain.\n\nThe veterans of a now defunct car manufacturing industry in Australia can only lament the Abbott government was not prepared to continue decades of taxpayer-funded generosity, given their own claims to the spin-off effects of the car industry on the local workforce and manufacturing skills base.\n\nBut continuing to help fund the sub-scale and shrinking manufacture of expensive cars that too few Australians wanted to buy clearly had much more limited appeal in Canberra than the more expensive prospect of \u201cworld class sovereign shipbuilding capacity\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Pacific 2019 international maritime exposition being held at Darling Harbour in Sydney this week is bringing together the naval industry from across the globe to showcase this effort. \u201cIt\u2019s like Christmas,\u201d says one attendee.\n\nDefence Minister Linda Reynolds told the conference the new naval program was necessary strategically but also part of future proofing capability.\n\nTaxpayers can only hope this costly national undertaking will achieve its promise in terms of broader economic activity, increased productivity and training and employment of a highly skilled workforce.\n\nThe transformation of the Osborne shipyards from a few modest, aged sheds to a sprawling new facility is just one aspect of that. Lendlease, the builders of the new southern area housing the frigate program, will hand over the $500 million project to ASC Shipbuilding by the first half of next year.\n\nLaing O\u2019Rourke will then construct a submarine yard on the north side according to a design by Naval Group.\n\nANI makes a sufficient if hardly commercial return for the government by leasing the facilities to the prime shipbuilding companies.\n\n\u201cThis is a very significant program the Commonwealth has undertaken to continuously build ships and subs for the next 50 years,\u201d Knox says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bold decision. This really is an Australian venture.\u201d\n\nWith, presumably, not a canoe in sight.", "description": "Five years ago, then defence minister David Johnston said he wouldn't trust ASC to build a canoe.
