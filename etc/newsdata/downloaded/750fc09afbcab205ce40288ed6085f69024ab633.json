One has already died.\n\nThe 30-year-old told Metro.co.uk about the profound effect the diagnosis has had on his life.\n\nThe DJ from Basingstoke said: \u2018There\u2019s practical stuff like not being able to work, of course.\n\n\u2018Emotionally, just knowing you have cancer by itself is bad, but figuring out it is this type of rare cancer is terrible.\u2019\n\nChad with his partner Anita and children Milan and Rome (Chad Alexander)\n\nChad, who lives with his children\u2019s nurse partner Anita and children Rome, four, and Milan, one, has been unable to work since he first got sick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with the money for his treatment, he hopes to raise awareness of this obscure disease.\n\nChad is fundraising towards a \u00a350,000 goal in order to access cutting-edge treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, the only place in the world he has found that has successfully treated a patient with the cancer.,\n\nThe fundraising page describes how \u2018everything changed\u2019 since he first noticed blood in his urine in June.\n\nTumours were found in his kidney and lung, which required a six-hour surgery to remove them, along with his left kidney, spleen, the tail of his pancreas and part of his diaphragm.\n\nDoctors carried out a six-hour surgery to remove his tumours (Chad Alexander)\n\nAfter receiving the official devastating diagnosis on Friday, Chad scoured the internet for more information on this disease he\u2019d never heard of.\n\n\u2018There is not much about research about this disease in the world, and not much that came back in the UK,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Even on that website where you type up your symptoms, nothing comes up.\u2019\n\nThrough his research, Chad got in touch with Cora Connor, who set up the outreach organisation RMC Support after her brother was diagnosed with the condition.\n\nShe recommended the doctor who had successfully treated her brother as Chad\u2019s best medical chance.\n\nChad is very eager to raise awareness of this rare disease (Chad ALexander)\n\nBut just an initial appointment with his specialist costs the equivalent of \u00a320,000, and that is before travel or any treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChad said that there are only two other people in the UK who have had RMC and one recently lost his battle.\n\nHe added: \u2018I need to raise awareness about it, particularly for people with the sickle cell trait.\n\n\u2018I have had lots of conversations about it with people living with it, or partners of those who\u2019ve passed away.\n\n\u2018I do not know whether anyone is as visible as myself.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018I need to get to get the treatment and get better, but also to use this as a platform.\u2019", "description": "A dad diagnosed with an extremely rare form of cancer is trying to raise \u00a350,000 to get the cutting-edge treatment he needs in the States.", "authors": ["Sophia Dourou"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91225642_1571766899.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
