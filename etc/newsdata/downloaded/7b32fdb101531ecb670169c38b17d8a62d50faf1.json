U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, recently told WCVB in Boston that Loughlin may find herself in more trouble than her fellow actress, Felicity Huffman, for her part in the scandal that's swept up many wealthy parents.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN'S DAUGHTER BELLA CELEBRATES 21ST BIRTHDAY AMID COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL\n\nLoughlin and her husband were accused of paying $500,000 to alleged scam mastermind William \"Rick\" Singer to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella recruited onto the University of Southern California's crew team despite neither girl ever being a rower. USC put the girls' enrollment statuses on hold amid an internal investigation into the scandal.\n\nThe pair rejected the plea deal that other parents allegedly involved in the case \u2013 including Huffman \u2013 accepted. Giannulli, 56, and Loughlin then were hit with additional charges of money laundering and conspiracy and would face up to 40 years behind bars if convicted on all charges.\n\nHuffman, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud earlier this year. She confessed to paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her older daughter's answers on the SAT. She considered the same for her younger daughter but decided against it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe was sentenced to 14 days behind bars, a $30,000 fine, one year of probation and must perform 250 hours of community service.", "description": "Lori Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli are handling their legal troubles with the college admissions scandal in completely opposite ways.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
