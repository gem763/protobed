'His behavior has been despicable, and the lies and half-truths and the deception that he's been doing at the direction of this president and beyond is unbecoming - and he should step before Congress and answer for it.'\n\nStep back: The presidential hopeful stood back as his actress love soaked up the limelight\n\nBreak: Booker was out in Southern California after a fiery war of words with ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani this week\n\nCommemoration: The couple posed together in a selfie at the glitzy debut\n\nGiuliani, responding in an appearance with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, said he wasn't intimidated at the prospect of being grilled by Booker in possible Senate hearings in the ongoing matter.\n\nHe mocked Booker's comparing himself to Spartacus during last year's Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh (in releasing a confidential document linked to the judge).\n\n'I have to go in the arena with Spartacus? Gee, I don't know if I can handle it - he's a really tough guy - he really scares me,' Giuliani said in jest.
