In late May, at a full-day, private conference in San Francisco, the firm was host to officials from the Treasury Department and Washington\u2019s alphabet soup of regulatory agencies.\n\nThe unusual event brought together securities- and futures-markets watchdogs at a lofty wedding hall decorated with a 31-foot reconstruction of an elm. Marc Andreessen, in opening remarks, compared cryptocurrencies to the early internet, which started as an information network for computer scientists and evolved into the world\u2019s information hub and an engine for commerce. Crypto, he said, could solve some of the internet\u2019s biggest challenges, including privacy threats, if Washington would adopt a less stringent form of regulation.\n\nThe message back from Washington wasn\u2019t accommodating, according to people who attended. J. Christopher Giancarlo, who was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission until stepping down in July, said he warned Andreessen Horowitz that regulation of crypto couldn\u2019t be brushed aside. \u201cSome of the things you learned from your older VCs, this won\u2019t transfer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence told startups at the conference, many of them funded by Andreessen Horowitz, that compliance with global anti-money-laundering rules needed to improve.\n\nCryptocurrencies face a significant degree of skepticism from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSEC Chairman Jay Clayton, who didn\u2019t attend the conference, clamped down on cryptocurrencies and related investments when he arrived in Washington in 2017. The SEC has told companies that they can\u2019t raise funds by selling digital assets without following SEC rules, effectively killing off the growth of initial coin offerings in the U.S.\n\nInvestors such as Andreessen Horowitz face the risk that digital coins they bought or sold could be deemed securities, which would restrict their trading, potentially damping value and adding layers of regulation. The firm has also bet on a range of crypto startups whose businesses could take off if regulators lightened their approach.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something they did purely out of altruism,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a technology scholar at the University of Pennsylvania who attended the conference. \u201cEveryone understands they are investors in the space and have viewpoints about what the regulatory environment should look like.\u201d\n\nRegulated companies often meet in private with regulators. While regulators often attend industry conferences that are usually open to the public, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s event was unusual, according to regulatory experts, because the firm got so many government officials with influence over crypto to show up and hear about the industry on its terms.\n\n\u201cFor one VC that has such a clear monetary interest in getting favorable regulatory treatment for crypto assets to host the event in a private, invite-only setting, it does strike me as unusual and untoward from a public standpoint,\u201d said Lee Reiners, executive director of the Global Financial Markets Center at Duke University.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz says it is trying to bridge a gap between financial regulators and the crypto industry, which sprang up with a goal of displacing traditional Wall Street middlemen and making most regulation obsolete.\n\n\"Regulation itself is not the problem, it\u2019s the lack of clarity around crypto regulation that our companies and the crypto space overall grapple with,\u201d said Kim Milosevich, a spokeswoman for Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nSenior SEC officials attended the event because engaging with investors is core to its mission, an agency spokeswoman said. \u201cIn the digital-asset space, we have engaged with those developing emerging technologies while also emphasizing that our securities laws continue to apply,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nVenture-capital investors such as Andreessen Horowitz operate in private markets where startups compete for funding. The SEC doesn\u2019t regulate the deals, having given them a regulatory exemption in the 1980s that many credit with helping Silicon Valley flourish.\n\nCryptocurrencies and similar assets known as digital tokens have sought a similarly light-touch treatment. But so far they haven\u2019t gotten it.\n\nIn April, Andreessen Horowitz decided to come under SEC oversight for the first time, giving up the exemption that allows venture capitalists to avoid regulation. The firm wanted to raise a $350 million fund focused on the crypto sector with holdings that could exceed an allowance for investing in assets other than stock issued in private deals.\n\nIt said in a June filing that regulatory uncertainty could restrict its ability to make new crypto bets and \u201cto realize the value of any investments by restricting the conversion of any such value into U.S. dollar-based assets.\" The firm says on its website that it has never sold its crypto holdings and could hang on to them for more than a decade.\n\nFacebook's plan to release its own currency, called Libra, has sparked a range of concerns among lawmakers.

Andreessen is also a supporter of Facebook\u2019s proposed digital coin Libra, which was criticized by the Trump administration after being unveiled in July.\n\nMr. Giancarlo, who was then the CFTC chairman, had a prime speaking role, and the SEC\u2019s \u201ccrypto czar\u201d spoke on a panel.\n\nAfter The Wall Street Journal sought comment about the conference, Andreessen Horowitz posted on Thursday some online video and audio from the event, including Mr. Andreessen\u2019s remarks.\n\nUnlike Wall Street banks and asset managers, the firm doesn\u2019t hire its own lobbyists to influence Congress. It helped underwrite Coin Center, an advocacy and research organization focused on cryptocurrencies, but it hasn\u2019t agreed to join the Blockchain Association, a new trade group focused on lobbying Congress.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz has instead sought changes through the National Venture Capital Association and through direct interactions with regulators. Through the association, it has asked the SEC to make it easier for venture-capital firms to invest in digital tokens and cryptocurrencies without giving up their unregulated status, according to two people familiar with the matter. Last year, Andreessen Horowitz asked SEC officials to develop an exemption, similar to the one that benefits private markets, for most digital assets.\n\nThe SEC hasn\u2019t moved on the request.\n\nLast year, the firm hired Katie Haun, a former federal prosecutor who handled some of the government\u2019s early cases involving bitcoin. Ms. Haun, a general partner who coleads Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto fund, was the MC of the conference and invited many of the regulators and law-enforcement officials, according to two people who attended.\n\nMs. Haun was the host of a dinner for the Washington visitors the evening before the conference, who dined at San Francisco\u2019s Angler restaurant.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How should cryptocurrencies be regulated in the U.S.? Are these investments that should fall under the U.S. approach to regulating Wall Street? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe next morning, Mr. Andreessen told the regulators that cryptocurrencies could solve the problem of \u201cmicropayments\u201d and improve privacy by reducing the dominant role of online ads. \u201cEighty percent of the things people hate about the internet today would not be problems,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, the industry says regulators haven\u2019t heeded their appeals.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. regulatory environment has gone from uncertain to hostile,\u201d said Bart Stephens, co-founder and managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture-capital investor focused on cryptocurrencies.\n\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com and Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com", "description": "Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm known for early investments in companies including Facebook, is putting up a fight against Washington\u2019s cryptocurrency crackdown.", "authors": ["Dave Michaels", "Alexander Osipovich", "Alexander.Osipovich Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-97925/social"}
