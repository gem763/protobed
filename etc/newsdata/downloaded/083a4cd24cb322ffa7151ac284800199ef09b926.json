(AP) - Kentucky\u2019s Ashton Hagans showed he was one of the most promising guards in college basketball last year, playing tough on-ball defense and his ability to distribute the basketball.\n\nNow, he needs to be a better scorer and the Wildcats might need his leadership more than anything else.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference\u2019s co-defensive player of the year is Kentucky\u2019s top returning scorer - though he averaged just 7.7 points per game. He is the lone starter among four returning veterans.\n\nKentucky\u2019s eight newcomers include freshmen guards Tyrese Maxey, Johnny Juzang and Dontaie Allen - who is sidelined with knee and shoulder injuries - and junior walk-on transfer Riley Welch. Wildcats coach John Calipari notes that Maxey and Hagans are \u201cgoing right at each other\u201d during preseason practices, with his veteran point guard enjoying the challenge and the verbal exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just being more vocal and showing guys the right way,\u201d said Hagans, who averaged 4.3 assists per contest with 61 steals. \u201cWe\u2019ve got four guys back with a leadership role on this team and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll need to be at our best.\u201d\n\nKentucky lost forward PJ Washington and guards Tyler Herro and Keldon Johnson to the NBA draft. That trio combined for 42 points per game, creating a huge offensive void to fill.\n\nCalipari hinted he might play a three-guard alignment with Immanuel Quickley. There\u2019s little question Hagans will have the ball often after he handed out 160 assists and provided stability during Kentucky\u2019s run to the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight.\n\nThe coach believes Hagans is ready and has returned to school more self-assured.\n\n\u201cEvery kid that comes in here, their first year there\u2019s anxiety,\u201d Calipari said during Tuesday\u2019s annual media day. \u201cAt times there\u2019s (what) I call it a fake swagger. You\u2019re scared to death but you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re not.\n\n\u201cIn that second year, if you\u2019re honest with yourself, if you\u2019re not delusional and you know what\u2019s expected and you\u2019re confident that you\u2019re trained to do it and grow like Ashton is right now, I mean he\u2019s got a different way about him. You can just see it.\u201d\n\nOffseason weight training has helped, though the Cartersville, Georgia, native can\u2019t say how much bulk has been added to his 6-foot-3, 198-pound frame. The work seems most obvious in his legs, though his biceps frequently contracted as he situated himself in a chair for interviews.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just tried to stay with Rob, get some extra work in if I can,\u201d Hagans said, referring to workouts with strength and conditioning coach Robert Harris. \u201cI just work real hard in the weight room so I can bring that aggressiveness on the court on the defensive end.\u201d\n\nHagans\u2018 goal is converting all his offseason work into more points.\n\nHe shot 47% last season but made just 28% from 3-point range and struggled with inconsistency down the stretch. He has worked this offseason to improve finishing at the basket while showing more confidence in his jumper.\n\n\u201cHis game has always been really good, but his jump shot\u2019s improving,\u201d Quickley said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been good at getting people involved. He\u2019s found a balance of being selfish and unselfish, and when I say selfish that\u2019s being a good thing because we need him to get buckets as well as pass. He\u2019s done a good job at both.\u201d\n\nHagans\u2018 steals total tied for the third most by a Wildcats freshman in program history. He also grabbed 96 rebounds while starting the final 29 games and went on to share SEC defensive honors with LSU\u2019s Tremont Waters.\n\nHe won\u2019t change his defensive mindset, but makes it clear he aims to take advantage on his chances more often this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just working with a coach daily, listening to them to see what they can do to help and trying to get better,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cA lot of things take time, so I\u2019ve just been trying to get in the gym and keep getting up shots.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kentucky's Ashton Hagans showed he was one of the most promising guards in college basketball last year, playing tough on-ball defense and his ability to distribute the basketball.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gary B.
