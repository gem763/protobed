Monday night presidential candidate Kamala Harris said that the Twitter account of President Trump should be suspended.\n\nDuring an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, the topic of the whistleblower came up. He asked her about any concern over the protection of the person she may have. From there she launched into her opinion that Trump\u2019s Twitter account should be suspended. \u201cWhen the President of the United States speaks, her words are very powerful and should be used in a way that is not about belittling or harming anyone. And this president has never really fully appreciated that responsibility.\u201d (Notice that Kamala uses the pronoun \u201cher\u201d when referring to the president.)\n\nPres. Trump's \"Twitter account should be suspended,\" says Kamala Harris. \"There's plenty of\u2026evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm\u2026so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.\" pic.twitter.com/k5SYGCuwX1 \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) October 1, 2019\n\nLook let's be honest, @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account should be suspended. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 1, 2019\n\nIn other words, a Democrat running for president doesn\u2019t like the words of the current Republican president. This is a woman who was the Attorney General of California and a District Attorney in San Francisco. She should be familiar with the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,\u201d the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CNN. \u201cFrankly, when you look at what he\u2019s been tweeting today directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we\u2019ve seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be \u2014 his Twitter account should be suspended.\u201d\n\nSenator Harris seems to be saying that if the president has words of criticism for those working to remove him from office, instead of inspirational words, then he must be shut down. Does anyone turn to Twitter for words of inspiration? This is consistent with the authoritarians among us who demand that anyone expressing thoughts or opinions different than their own must be silenced. In social media, it is called deplatforming.\n\nPresident Trump is known for using Twitter to get his daily messages out to his millions of followers. He doesn\u2019t mince words or sugar-coats his thoughts. His behavior has not changed since he first began using Twitter, years before he ran for president. This is nothing new. A demand that Trump\u2019s Twitter account be suspended or terminated is not an original thought, either. In 2017 an employee of Twitter \u201caccidentially\u201d briefly deactivated Trump\u2019s account. In September 2017, Twitter refused to pacify those who were calling for the termination of his account by declaring his tweets newsworthy.\n\nHarris thinks Trump\u2019s tweets about the whistleblower are harmful and so he must be silenced. Who died and made her the boss of everyone? Just think if she were ever to be elected as president (she won\u2019t be) and put her authoritiarianism tendencies into place. Twitter is a public company, not a governmental agency.\n\nThere is an online petition up at Change.org which demands the suspension or cancellation of Trump\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nThe impeachment train is going full steam ahead down the track. The House is moving with a swiftness not often seen because of some members thinking, wistfully, this time we\u2019ve got him. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint about the phone call to the Ukrainian president is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Or so they think.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi is in authoritarian mode, too. She launched impeachment inquiries involving six committees before ever even calling for a vote in the House. She has completely shut out the voices of the minority in the House. Does no one have a concern about that? It isn\u2019t technically unconstitutional but it is unprecedented. Yet, she is heralded across the country and on television 24/7 as a bold leader. Instead, I would argue that she caved to the far left in her party in hopes of retaining the majority in the House in 2020. Pelosi claims the impeachment inquiries will be limited to focusing on the Ukraine corruption allegations. Good luck with that, Madame Speaker.\n\nKamala Harris is calling for censorship of an opposing view. She\u2019s calling for the right of free speech of the President of the United States to be shut down. Imagine what she would do if she was in the highest office in the land.
