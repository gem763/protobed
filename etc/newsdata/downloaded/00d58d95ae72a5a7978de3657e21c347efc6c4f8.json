Soon all five Washington Mystics on the court were in on the hug, then the whole team, before confetti rained down to mark the end of the game and the end of a journey.\n\nThe Mystics captured the first WNBA title in their 22-year history Thursday with a dramatic Game 5 WNBA Finals win over the Connecticut Sun, winning the series three games to two.\n\nWashington beat Connecticut 89-78 despite trailing by as many as nine points. Emma Meesseman led the Mystics with 22 points, Delle Donne scored 21 and Cloud had 18 including a pair of clutch 3-pointers in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe game was tied at 72 with 5:10 remaining when the Mystics broke free. Delle Donne, Kristi Toliver and Meesseman combined for an 8-0 run with buckets in the paint on four straight possessions, giving them all the cushion they needed for the rest of the night.\n\nThe Mystics finally reached the pinnacle of the sport, after the acquisitions of coach Mike Thibault, Delle Donne and Toliver set a franchise turnaround into motion.\n\nA year after the Seattle Storm swept them in the finals, the Mystics set out with championship aspirations and a clear team motto from Day 1: \u201cRun it back.\u201d Strengthened by the opening of their new home facility in Ward 8, the Mystics set a franchise record by going 26-8 in the regular season.\n\nFour months after their first home game at Entertainment and Sports Arena, they lifted the trophy there.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t want to win it anywhere else,\u201d Delle Donne said before the game. \u201cThis place has been great to us. It\u2019s made such a difference in one season, so to do it here just would be right.\u201d\n\nConnecticut led 43-42 after a first half with six lead changes and 11 ties, as neither team pulled off a run larger than 6-0. The Sun then opened the third quarter scoring 10 of the first 12 points, but Meesseman erupted for 11 points in the period to bring the Mystics neck and neck, setting up the triumphant final quarter.\n\nSixteen months after the Capitals won the Stanley Cup, a second Monumental team has earned a championship banner for the District.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
