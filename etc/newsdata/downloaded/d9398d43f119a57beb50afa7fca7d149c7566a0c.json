It remained outlawed until 2003.\n\nIn 2007, on the 50th anniversary of Kimathi's death, then president Mwai Kibaki unveiled a bronze statue of the freedom fighter on a street named after him in downtown Nairobi.\n\nIn 2013, Britain compensated more than 5,200 elderly Kenyans tortured and abused during the insurgency.", "description": "The grave site of a guerilla leader in Kenya's anti-colonial rebellion has been discovered beneath a prison in Nairobi, a foundation set up by his family says, more than 60 years after he was executed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7937/4b04b12b70e54ef4a70092c785fa4bca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
