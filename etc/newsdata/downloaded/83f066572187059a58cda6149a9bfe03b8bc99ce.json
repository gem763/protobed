He was saying, \u2018I do not deserve to have friends,\u2019 and, \u2018I do not deserve to play football\u2019.\n\n\u201cThen that became, \u2018I do not deserve to live\u2019. He said, \u2018When we get home I\u2019m going to take my clothes off and sit outside until I freeze to death\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe were really shocked as he\u2019d never said anything like it before.\n\n\u201cWe were asking him if something had happened. We thought maybe when he\u2019d been out playing that a bigger person had done something awful to him. He kept saying that nothing had happened and he couldn\u2019t explain why he felt like that.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\nThat night he kept asking his horrified parents why they would not help him to die and, the following day, Alison discovered a note he had written saying: \"I\u2019m really sorry I don\u2019t want to live anymore. I want to be in heaven.\"\n\nEventually, after four months, Jack, of Dumfries, Scotland, was diagnosed with PANDAS, a set of conditions which result in inflammation of the brain, causing a variety of neuro-psychiatric complaints, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), tics and eating disorders.\n\nAlthough Jack's condition improved within days of being put on a course of antibiotics, his parents are now determined to raise awareness of PANDAS - paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder - which is often misdiagnosed as a behavioural issue.\n\nAlison, who also has a daughter Cara, seven, said: \u201cJack was a really sociable eight-year-old. He loved playing football, doing gymnastics, martial arts and being with his friends.\n\n\u201cBut in January 2018 that changed overnight.\"\n\nTerrified in case he attempted suicide, his mum made an appointment with their GP, who made an urgent referral to the child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).\n\nRecalling the appointment, Alison said: \u201cHe looked like a severely autistic child. He was playing with the toys on the floor and was in his own little world. He did not look like Jack, he looked like a lost little boy.\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\n\u201cThey thought he might have been on the autistic spectrum, but before this there was nothing suggesting that. It was so sudden and made no sense.\n\n\u201cAt one point he looked terrified, his pupils were really dilated and we weren\u2019t sure if he recognised us or if he thought we were strangers.\u201d\n\nOver the ensuing weeks, Jack developed vocal tics and a stutter, as well as starting to regress - playing with baby toys and watching Thomas the Tank Engine, which he had not seen since he was three.\n\nHe would repeat meaningless phrases, screech, or bark like a dog and became sensitive to noise and smells.\n\nAlison continued: \u201cHe was very irritable. We felt like we were walking on eggshells around him. He had really severe mood swings and really isolated himself. He couldn\u2019t cope with people.\n\n\u201cOne of us talking was enough to set him off and he could be extremely aggressive towards me. There was one moment when he was jumping up and down on my neck laughing this evil laugh and when he spoke it was like it wasn\u2019t his voice. It was as if he was possessed.\n\n\u201cThroughout his ordeal, he was going to school, but there were times when he would really struggle. He would have a full blown temper tantrum at the school gates, like a two-year old.\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\n\u201cMost of the time he managed to hold it together at school, but he would come home like a coiled spring ready to explode if you said the wrong thing.\"\n\nBut the person Jack was hardest on was himself.\n\nAlison said: \"He developed a really restricted diet, just living off pasta and cheese for months and he would have to eat by himself, in a separate room.\n\n\u201cHe stopped sleeping in his bed, saying he didn\u2019t deserve to sleep in a nice comfy bed. He would wander around looking for the most uncomfortable place to sleep. Eventually, we managed to persuade him to stay on the sofa bed downstairs.\n\n\u201cIt was such a severe change in him that there had to be an explanation.\u201d\n\nDesperate for answers, after taking Jack to see a paediatrician in March 2018, he had an MRI scan and an electroencephalogram (EEG), which is used to find problems related to electrical activity in the brain.\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\nBut the results showed nothing unusual and it was suggested he could have an anxiety disorder, having ruled out autism.\n\n\u201cI know it sounds shocking, but I was hoping the MRI would show something that would explain it,\" said Alison. \"When it came back completely normal I felt strangely disappointed that my child had a normal brain.\n\n\u201cI thought Jack would be happy that his brain was normal, but he was completely devastated. He burst into tears and said, \u2018This has made me feel worse that there\u2019s no reason. This makes me want to die even more\u2019.\u201d\n\nAfter conducting some online research, Alison came across PANDAS but, with medics reluctant to test for the still little known condition, she sought a second opinion from consultant paediatrician Dr Tim Ubhi at the Children\u2019s e-Hospital, an online service providing expert paediatric advice to parents and their children.\n\nAfter a Skype consultation in May 2018, he diagnosed PANDAS and devised a treatment plan of antibiotics and ibuprofen - an anti-inflammatory painkiller - which Jack\u2019s doctor agreed to.\n\n\u201cI felt like he was the first person to listen to me,\u201d said Alison.\n\n\u201cBlood test results showed Jack\u2019s stress antibodies were raised.\n\n\"The way I explained it to Jack is that the antibodies had been attacking his brain rather than the source of the infection.\n\n\u201cDr Ubhi suggested it could have been caused by a strep infection at the back of the throat, because his strep levels were raised. Looking back, about a week before it happened, Jack was complaining of a sore throat , but that was it.\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\n\u201cNow he was so happy to have an explanation for what had been happening. It made such a difference to know that there were other people with it, too. \"\n\nWithin a couple of days of taking antibiotics in May - after four months of torment - Jack was like his old self again.\n\nAlison said: \u201cCara and I were going to the supermarket and he actually volunteered to come with us, which he hadn\u2019t done for five months.\n\n\u201cWe all walked around with huge grins on our faces. Cara was over the moon to have her big brother back. They were so close before this happened.\u201d\n\nBut, after two weeks, he went down to a maintenance dose of antibiotics and started to deteriorate again - talking about running away and becoming homeless.\n\n\u201cAll the thoughts about dying had come back. And then it became harder to get the medication in him, because he didn\u2019t want to get better, he wanted to die,\u201d Alison said.\n\n\u201cThere was one occasion when he\u2019d just come off them and out of the blue he held a knife to his throat and said he was going to die. We weren\u2019t prepared for it, so his sister saw all this happening, which was awful.\n\n(Image: PA Real Life)\n\n\u201cNow we are in this cycle of when he\u2019s on antibiotics he is okay, but when he comes off them he deteriorates again.\u201d\n\nAlison also feels that, although doctors agree with his PANDAS diagnosis, it can be difficult to get his ongoing antibiotics prescribed, meaning that, at times, his treatment has been fragmented.\n\nShe said: \"I think partly because there's no published studies demonstrating that long-term antibiotics are beneficial and there's a reluctance to prescribe them because there's concerns about us becoming resistant to them.\"\n\nDuring a family break to the Haven Holiday park in Aire, Scotland, in July, Jack - off antibiotics at the time - was really struggling with anxiety and irritability, according to his mum.\n\n\u201cHe would normally love to go on the go karts but he was too anxious,\" she said. \"There were times when he talked about running away and nobody loving him.\n\n\u201cHe developed really weird obsessions, like he became scared of steps and stairs and of walking on seagull poo. We were by the seaside, so it would take us hours to get anywhere.\u201d\n\nOne of the saddest consequences of Jack's illness has been the damage it has done to his relationship with Cara, who has become wary of the big brother she once so adored.\n\n\u201cThey were like two peas in a pod before all this, then he withdrew and was really irritable and she didn\u2019t understand what it was about,\" explained Alison.\n\n\u201cBut she is a constant source of love and optimism to us all.\n\n\u201cFor Neil and me it has felt, at times, like we have been judged by everyone. The fact Jack could hold it together sometimes, particularly at school, meant some medics thought it was a lack of boundaries at home causing the problem. One even suggested we take up parenting classes.\n\n\u201cBut we have also received a lot of understanding and help from other doctors. I do realise this is a very difficult condition to diagnose and treat.\"\n\nMeanwhile, despite not knowing what the future holds, the family remain optimistic.\n\nAlison added: \u201cThere are some studies that suggest children grow out of PANDAS when they reach puberty, because the immune system matures. But there is a lack of research, so we really don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still a long way to go in terms of getting this illness properly recognised\n\n\u201cWe take each day as it comes but we do feel hopeful.\n\n\u201cJack\u2019s missed out on two years of his childhood, but throughout it he has been really strong and brave. Whatever life throws at him now he will be able to handle it.\n\n\"Now I am joining forces with the charity PANS PANDAS UK - who have been an amazing source of support and advice to us - to raise awareness of the illness.\n\n\u201cI want other parents to be aware of the conditions PANS and PANDAS, so that, if their child suddenly develops these symptoms or changes in personality they see their GP immediately, and get antibiotics as soon as possible so that, hopefully, they can avoid all this pain.\"", "description": "Jack Maclaine, 10, terrified his parents with devastating outbursts saying he wanted to sit outside until he froze to death and he didn't deserve to live", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Harriet Whitehead", "Image", "Pa Real Life"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646672.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Jack-Maclaine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
