CEO Persson on Thursday told analysts and media on a call that range was still reachable, but did not say when.\n\nMarkdowns decreased for a fourth straight quarter, by 2 percentage points in relation to sales.\n\nH&M in June had predicted a 1.5 percentage point decrease. The company unusually did not provide an outlook for markdowns in the current quarter.\n\n\"We believe we have reached an inflection point for margins and foresee the potential for further markdown recovery over the next 2-3 years,\" said RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain, who recently raised his rating on H&M to \"outperform\".\n\nH&M said sales in September, the first month of its fourth quarter, grew 8% in local currencies.\n\nPersson said on the call with analysts and media that favorable weather had helped boost sales.\n\nExecutives also said on the call that activity to transform the company would remain high in coming quarters in an indication investment would stay elevated.", "description": "H&M shares surge after first quarterly profit rise in two years", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF920BE_L.jpg"}
