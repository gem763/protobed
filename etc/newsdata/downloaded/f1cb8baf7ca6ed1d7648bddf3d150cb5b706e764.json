REUTERS/Yen Duong\n\nPHAN RANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Thousands of Vietnam\u2019s ethnic Cham people met under rainy late September skies for their annual \u201cKate\u201d festival that, according to the multi-faith community\u2019s calendar, marks the end of one harvest season and the beginning of another.\n\nThe Cham are descendents of a powerful ancient kingdom that once spanned large parts of central and southern Vietnam a millennium ago.\n\nThey are a traditionally matriarchal society, which worships a female goddess and expects the youngest daughter to inherit family assets.\n\nA rich history of trading and movement across Asia have made the Cham a uniquely multi-faith group, divided into predominantly Hindu and Muslim branches, all of whom come together to celebrate \u201cKate\u201d.\n\nThe week-long festival, which began last Friday, marks the Cham calendar\u2019s de facto new year, at the onset of a new harvest.\n\nAt the Po Klong Garai temple in the southern town of Phan Rang - a Vietnamese rendering of Panduranga, the Cham Kingdom\u2019s ancient capital - dozens of men in bright red and white traditional costume paraded with a sacred garment.\n\nThe holy dress, which is kept in the nearby commune of Phuoc Ha, is brought to the crumbling, clay-brick 13th Century temple, within which lies a statue of the Hindu god, Shiva.\n\nBehind a small door, the deity is dressed in the sacred Cham garments by religious leaders, who perform traditional rites and blessings. Others make offerings of fruit, boiled chicken and white rice on bamboo mats laid at the foot of the ancient temple.", "description": "Thousands of Vietnam's ethnic Cham people met under rainy late September skies for their annual \"Kate\" festival that, according to the multi-faith community's calendar, marks the end of one harvest season and the beginning of another.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435680566&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1JB", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
