For senior girls at Blair, decisions about what to wear to school are influenced by differences in culture, religion and body types. (Cheryl Diaz Meyer/For The Washington Post)\n\nIt was the morning of the first day of senior year, and Sky Bloomer had her back-to-school outfit ready to go: red-and-black Air Jordan Retro sneakers, black leggings and a tight, spaghetti-strap crop top with a koi fish print from Urban Outfitters.\n\nThe tall teenager with long brown hair walked out of her bedroom and swung on her backpack, feeling \u201cpowerful,\u201d she recalled. Then, her parents saw her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting you leave the house looking like that,\u201d said her mother, Tara Bloomer, telling her daughter that she looked like an \u201ceasy girl.\u201d A \u201cprostitute.\u201d Seeing his daughter walk down the driveway, Sky\u2019s father, Bryan Bloomer, tried asking her to change. But the teenager didn\u2019t budge. She got into her friend\u2019s car and left for school.\n\nMinutes later, Sky\u2019s father called her cellphone. He asked her what kind of message her outfit would send to her teachers and classmates on the first day. Truly powerful and intelligent women, he told his daughter, \u201cdon\u2019t have to show off everything they have.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, misogynist,\u201d she replied.\n\nSky\u2019s clothing choices have become a frequent point of tension between the teenager and her parents since the beginning of the semester at Montgomery Blair High School in Maryland. Fights like this one are, in some ways, an inevitable part of high school. For generations, rebellious teenagers and their parents have clashed over what clothing is appropriate for school.\n\nBut this is high school in the age of Me Too, of hashtags about body positivity and campaigns against \u201cslut shaming.\u201d Teenage girls today are using the language of female empowerment to defend their outfit choices to the adults around them, claiming autonomy over their bodies and calling out clothing restrictions they see as sexist.\n\nAmid this generational shift, parents are wrestling with how to talk to their teenage daughters about the clothes they wear. How do parents draw a line between what\u2019s suitable for school and what isn\u2019t? Should that line exist at all?\n\n\u201cWe used to make the argument that she was participating in her own objectification. Now girls are arguing back that this is a form of power they want to claim,\u201d said Lisa Damour, a psychologist and the author of several books on parenting adolescent girls. \u201cI\u2019ve watched parents get completely stymied by this.\u201d]\n\n[How to talk with teens about \u2018appropriate\u2019 clothes for school]\n\nIn schools across the country, girls have staged protests against dress codes that they say are unfair and unevenly enforced, disproportionately targeting black, brown and curvier girls. Last month, girls at one school in Montgomery County, Md., responded to a new dress code by wearing exactly the kinds of clothes it prohibited.\n\nAt Sky\u2019s school in the same county a few years ago, female students protested the dress code by posting photos of their outfits on social media with the hashtag #WhoAmIDistracting. In recent years, students say, teachers rarely call out dress code violations. These decisions instead usually fall on parents \u2014 and the students themselves.\n\n\u201cIt feels like an enigma wrapped inside a riddle,\u201d Damour said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the right way to empower my daughter? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s so clear anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nSydney Acuff, 18, walks to Montgomery Blair High School. Acuff said she likes clothes that show her midriff. (Cheryl Diaz Meyer/For The Washington Post)\n\n'Internalized misogyny'\n\nThese conversations are made murkier by the pressures teenage girls face to look a certain way on Instagram and other social media platforms, which often encourage girls to seek validation through likes and comments.\n\nSydney Acuff, a 17-year-old senior at Blair High School, started wearing more revealing clothes last school year after a breakup with a boyfriend who was \u201cvery controlling and very manipulative,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to rebel against him. That was one way I did it.\u201d\n\nShe stopped wearing bras and started wearing \u201ca lot of semi-see-through tops, a lot of camisoles,\u201d Sydney said. \u201cMy midriff is almost always showing to some extent.\u201d\n\nWhen she was coping with the breakup, she noticed that she was posting more selfies on social media. \u201cAm I doing this because I want to, or am I doing this because I know these people are going to make me feel good for a certain amount of time and then I\u2019ll go back to feeling sad?\u201d she reflected. \u201cThat\u2019s something I have to be careful with and have to be mindful of.\u201d\n\nBut as the teenager has grown more confident in her body, her clothes have been a way for her to experiment, to be creative, she said.\n\nHer mother, meanwhile, has struggled with Sydney\u2019s crop tops and short skirts. She has tried explaining that certain clothes are disrespectful to her teachers and are a better fit for the beach or a party.\n\n\u201cMy friends and I, our generation, we consider ourselves feminist,\u201d said her mother, Mary Denham, a 56-year-old social worker. \u201cI would think things like that would be the opposite of being a feminist.\n\nHer mother, Sydney argues, views the issue through \u201ca very second-wave [feminist] lens\u201d peppered with \u201cinternalized misogyny.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if we\u2019re dressed completely respectably, we still face the same stuff we would face if we\u2019re dressed half-naked,\u201d Sydney said. \u201cWe still get assaulted, we still get belittled, and we have our intelligence knocked.\u201d\n\nThrough their conversations, Denham has begun to understand Sydney\u2019s views. \u201cI\u2019m trying to bite my tongue more and more,\u201d she said. \u201cI try not to be as judging of it as I was.\u201d\n\nFor other senior girls, even in the same friend group at the same school, decisions about what to wear are complicated further by differences in culture, religion and body types. Khushboo Rathore, another 17-year-old at Blair, would like to be able to wear crop tops and bandeaus like other girls at school do, like the girls on Instagram who post the caption \u201chot girl summer\u201d and like the \u201cVSCO girls\u201d who look beachy and effortless with their short shorts, scrunchies and Hydro Flasks.\n\n[Rankings are a part of high school. Some teens aren\u2019t taking it anymore.]\n\nThese trends are \u201cbasically just meant for skinny girls who can pull those clothes off,\u201d Khushboo said. Not only does she feel uncomfortable in many of those clothes, her parents, who grew up in a more conservative culture in India, often call her out for shirts that are too low-cut. Even when she\u2019s not trying to highlight her curves, her mother makes comments about covering up her cleavage, Khushboo said.\n\n\u201cAnytime I\u2019m in the house without a bra on, she says, \u2018Put a bra on before your dad or father or grandfather sees you,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nSometimes, parents can send mixed messages about their daughters\u2019 clothing.\n\n\n\nJenny Granados Villatoro, 17, chats with another student as she walks to Montgomery Blair High School. Granados-Villatoro likes to look more masculine on some days and more feminine on other days. But she doesn\u2019t usually feel comfortable wearing crop tops and other revealing clothes. \u201cEvery time I go shopping it\u2019s kind of harder for me,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what every clothing store is selling.\u201d (Cheryl Diaz Meyer/For The Washington Post)\n\nJenny Granados-Villatoro, 17, says her Salvadoran mother usually doesn\u2019t approve of shirts below the collar bone for school. But for prom last year, when Jenny wore a dress with a low V-neck, her mother encouraged her to buy a new bra that would better accentuate her curves.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018No, I feel comfortable in my dress like this,\u2019 \u201d without the new push-up bra, Jenny said. \u201cIt kind of threw me off, and I was confused and I thought about it a lot.\u201d\n\nJenny said she understood where she was coming from. Her mother grew up competing in beauty pageants in a small town in El Salvador, in a culture with more traditional expectations of women.\n\n\u201cShe was dolling me up, I guess, to make sure I looked good enough for someone to come to me and have a conversation,\u201d Jenny said.\n\nAccommodating a culture\n\nSky Bloomer says clothes are a way for her to show off her confidence, her \u201caesthetic.\u201d On her Instagram account, mirror selfies of Sky in a lime-green bikini appear next to photos of the teenager at swim practice or performing at Cambodian cultural events, a nod to her mother\u2019s heritage. She says her outfits are about expression, not the likes she gets from her peers, the friends who post flame emoji and comments like \u201cqueen\u201d and \u201cso prettyy.\u201d\n\nBut her parents worry about her motivations behind outfits like the one she wore on the first day of school.\n\n\u201cHonestly, Sky, I do not want us to use our bodies . . . to get attention,\u201d Tara Bloomer said as the family sat around a table eating Subway sandwiches on a recent afternoon.\n\n\u201cWho said that my outfit was to get attention?\u201d Sky responded.\n\n\u201cSo what were you thinking when you got dressed that way?\u201d her father asked, with genuine curiosity in his voice.\n\n\u201cI looked good! It fit me well, the colors matched,\u201d Sky said.\n\n\u201cSo, say more about \u2018fit me well,\u2019 \u201d Bryan Bloomer said.\n\n\u201cIt was tight, it was a nice, tight outfit!\u201d Sky said.\n\n\u201cUh huh, in the literal sense of the word \u2018tight,\u2019 \u201d her father said. \u201cIt totally showed off all of your shape, leaving very little to the imagination.\u201d\n\nSky told them that \u201cliterally everyone\u201d at school wears clothes like that and no one commented negatively on her outfit.\n\n\n\nSky Bloomer, 18, waits on a friend to give her a ride to Montgomery Blair High School. (Cheryl Diaz Meyer/For The Washington Post)\n\nHer mom acknowledged that they don\u2019t have these same conversations with Sky\u2019s older brothers. \u201cThere\u2019s a gender bias here,\u201d she said. She wishes she could trust that the boys and men in Sky\u2019s orbit will be respectful of her in any clothing. But she and her husband can\u2019t help worrying that someone could take advantage of her.\n\n\u201cWe have this ideal for what we\u2019d like our society to be, and then there\u2019s the reality,\u201d her father said.\n\nThe reality terrifies Bryan Bloomer. In conversations about Sky\u2019s clothing, his mind quickly spirals to fears about the porn industry, human trafficking and the dark corners of the Internet \u201ctrying to suck these young, beautiful women in,\u201d he said. He worries about the modeling requests Sky received after performing in beauty pageants recently. He thinks back to one of his friends from high school, a girl who was kidnapped at a 7-Eleven and whose body was later found in a field.\n\nHe told Sky about the newspaper articles he\u2019d read recently in which a man accused of sexual assault used the defense that the victim \u201cwas dressed a certain way and she was just asking for it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so offensive, but yet they\u2019re getting away with it. They make it about the women\u2019s look.\u201d\n\n[Black girls say D.C. school dress codes unfairly target them]\n\n\u201cSky, it\u2019s not an excuse for anyone to hurt you in any way because of the way you dress,\u201d his wife interjected.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s not an excuse,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s partly the environment that\u2019s out there,\u201d the mother said.\n\nSky pushed back, refusing to accept their argument. \u201cIf we all want women to be able to dress how they want . . . and feel comfortable in what they\u2019re wearing, you just have to go for it and do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question I have is whether that\u2019s really coming from the inside out, or whether that\u2019s influenced by this rape culture that\u2019s sending the message that your power comes from your looks and you have to put it out there in a way that\u2019s sexy,\u201d her father said. \u201cHow much of that is really them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat she\u2019s saying is you and I are cowards, instead of fighting what people are doing that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Tara Bloomer told her husband.\n\nBut she asked Sky, \u201cDo you think maybe 75 percent of you is doing this to claim your ownership of your right to dress nicely . . . and the other 25 percent is you being influenced by the culture where they manipulate women to show their bodies?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I feel manipulated into showing my body at all,\u201d Sky said.\n\nHer mother said she was proud of her daughter for standing up for herself. She agreed that \u201cwe should not accommodate this culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want you to have a bit of a balance,\u201d Tara Bloomer said. \u201cKeep track that your choices are yours.\u201d\n\nThe day after their conversation, Sky turned 18. On Instagram, she posted a photo in the birthday outfit she chose to wear to school. It got more than 570 likes and 200 comments.\n\nThere she was, posing and smiling in front of her high school, wearing the same black-and-red Urban Outfitters crop top.", "description": "Students say dress codes are \u201cmisogynistic,\u201d but parents still worry about the messages clothes send.", "authors": ["Samantha Schmidt", "Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VqzJ_bGAFVfEUe6YA4V_Tc-_19s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KGSDGJW7XUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
