Castro simultaneously cast doubt on Biden\u2019s self-appointed status as heir to Obama\u2019s presidency, his commitment to universal health care coverage and his mental acuity.\n\nBiden argued that his proposed public health insurance option that Americans can buy into would achieve the same goals as the Medicare for All system proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) without forcing Americans to drop their private insurance.\n\n\u201cIf you lose the job from your ... employer, you automatically can buy into this,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cNo pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.\u201d\n\nBut Castro noted that by making enrollment in this public program optional rather than automatic, Biden\u2019s plan fails to guarantee universal coverage. It\u2019s a feature of Biden\u2019s plan that he disputed in the last presidential debate, but as CNN noted in a fact check, his plan only claims it will guarantee coverage for 97% of the population. In a country of 327 million people, that leaves 10 million Americans without coverage.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama\u2019s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered,\u201d Castro said. \u201cHe wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\u201d\n\nMike Blake / Reuters Juli\u00e1n Castro, who has struggled to break through in public polls, has made the most of his debate appearances with fiery exchanges.\n\nBiden, who has wrapped himself in Obama\u2019s presidency more than any other candidate, interjected repeatedly to deny that characterization.\n\n\u201cThey do not have to buy in!\u201d he insisted. \u201cThey do not have to buy in \u2015\u201d\n\nHe cut him off and went on to insinuate that Biden\u2019s memory might be failing him.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d he asked, eliciting gasps from the live audience at Texas Southern University. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that!\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also suggested that his plan went further than Biden\u2019s, decried the pitched tone of Castro\u2019s exchange.\n\n\u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington: scoring points against each other, poking at each other and telling each other that \u2018My plan, your plan \u2015 look \u2015\u2019\u201d\n\nCastro cut him off, too. \u201cThat\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That\u2019s called an election. That\u2019s an election. You know? This is what we\u2019re here for. It\u2019s an election,\u201d he said, eliciting cheers from the crowd.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota did her best to call for unity as well, though her line barely made it through the din.\n\n\u201cA house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we\u2019re going to win this,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a follow-up interview after the debate, Castro denied that he was casting aspersions on how Biden\u2019s age is affecting his fitness for office.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t taking a shot at his age,\u201d he told ABC News.\n\nThere is some disagreement as to whether Castro\u2019s attack was fair, with Politifact deeming it \u201cmostly false.\u201d\n\nThe lack of clarity in Biden\u2019s language appears to have contributed to a misunderstanding. Biden might have thought Castro was suggesting that his plan required that people buy in to his public health care option and thus his response: that they \u201cdo not have to buy in.\u201d But in so doing, Biden merely confirmed Castro\u2019s point that enrollment under Biden\u2019s plan is optional rather than automatic, which is why Castro seized on it as evidence of Biden contradicting himself.\n\nIn a subsequent part of the exchange, Biden appeared to understand that they were debating the merits of optional enrollment. He noted that his plan automatically enrolls Americans who are eligible for Medicaid \u2015 those with earnings below 138% of the federal poverty level \u2015 and thus would likely cover Castro\u2019s late diabetic grandmother, whom Castro had referenced in the debate.\n\n\u201cIf she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled,\u201d Biden said.\n\nLater on in the evening, Castro lit into Biden for failing to clarify whether he agreed early on with Obama\u2019s policy of ramping up deportation of undocumented immigrations and neglecting to prioritize immigration reform in the first two years of his presidency when Democrats controlled Congress. It\u2019s a subject that Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey lambasted Biden for failing to address in the last debate in Detroit on July 31.\n\nThe exchange began when Univision host Jorge Ramos, who co-moderated the debate, asked Biden whether he considered the administration\u2019s harder-line approach to immigration a \u201cmistake.\u201d Ramos also asked why Latinos should trust Biden, given his service in an Obama administration in which immigration reform advocates increasingly find fault.\n\nHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions. I don\u2019t get that. Juli\u00e1n Castro\n\nBiden first fell back on a stock answer. \u201cComparing [President Obama] to the president we have is outrageous,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Ramos called him out for failing to answer the question: Does he stand by the Obama administration\u2019s record?\n\n\u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,\u201d Biden finally said.\n\nRamos continued: What about Biden?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nRamos then turned to Castro, asking him what compromises he\u2019d be willing to make to help immigrants as president.\n\nBut Castro stayed on Biden, finishing the job that Ramos started with a riff on Booker\u2019s critique of Biden from the previous debate.\n\n\u201cEvery time something good about Barack Obama comes up, [Biden] says, \u2018Oh, I was there, I was there, I was there \u2015 that\u2019s me, too.\u2019 And then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018Well, that was the president,\u2019\u201d Castro declared, prompting applause from the audience. \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions. I don\u2019t get that.\u201d\n\nBiden denied saying that.\n\n\u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent. That\u2019s where I stand,\u201d he replied.\n\nCastro, the only Latino candidate in the presidential primary field, has staked his underdog bid for the presidency in no small part on his ambitious immigration reform plan. During the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami in late June, Castro had a heated exchange with former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a fellow Texan who refused to back Castro\u2019s plan to downgrade unauthorized border crossings to a civil violation from their current status as a felony.\n\nOf course, staking one\u2019s candidacy in part on a criticism of Obama\u2019s legacy is tricky terrain for any Democratic White House hopeful. The former president retains sky-high popularity among Democratic voters.\n\nCastro was careful, though, to praise Obama for his work passing the Affordable Care Act and distinguish him from Trump when it comes to immigration policy.\n\n\u201cI agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump,\u201d Castro said. \u201cDonald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article attributed the comment about a \u201chouse divided\u201d to Sen.
