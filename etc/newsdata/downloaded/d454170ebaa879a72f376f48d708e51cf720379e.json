Who should provide the pinpoint pass for his try? Brother Beauden, of course.", "description": "If Ireland v New Zealand was a battle between Johnny Sexton and Beauden Barrett, the All Blacks playmaker was the undisputed winner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9374/3deceb4c8d474e3d893a0ab996cb919b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
