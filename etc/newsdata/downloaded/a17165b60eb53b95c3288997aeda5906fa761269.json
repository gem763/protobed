Prices for properties on sale there grew by 1.5%, compared to a 29% jump in average salaries offered.\n\nAlso read: More (mostly rich) South Africans are now getting home loans \u2013 here\u2019s why\n\nOn the flip side, Green said Cape Town and Johannesburg are the most expensive cities to buy residential properties in South Africa.\n\nProperty24 showed that average prices for residential properties on sale in Johannesburg shot up by as much as 68% in a year\u2019s time, while Cape Town residential properties on sale saw price increases of 58%.\n\nSource: Business Insider South Africa\n\nBack to homepage.", "description": "", "authors": ["Business Insider South Africa"], "top_image": "https://myhome.24.com/Here-are-the-most-affordable-cities-in-South-Africa-to-buy-a-house/assets/qbHy6CxLUI/tierra-mallorca-rgj1j8sdeay-unsplash-2560x1922.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
