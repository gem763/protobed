It also authorizes the prosecutor to impanel a grand jury and to file charges.\n\nThe report also coincides with speculation that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz will soon release his report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses during the Trump-Russia. A source told Fox News that Horowitz\u2019s report will \u201cshed light on why Durham\u2019s investigation has become a criminal inquiry.\u201d A reported flashpoint in Durham\u2019s investigation is whether the FBI improperly obtained FISA warrants to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.\n\nAppearing Monday on the Fox News Channel, Barr weighed in on Durham\u2019s probe, saying the prosecutor is \u201cmaking great progress\u201d and shared he is \u201cconfident\u201d Durham is \u201cgoing to get to the bottom of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let the chips fall where they may,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI think they all know John Durham\u2019s reputation and we\u2019ll just see how it turns out.\u201d", "description": "The DOJ's criminal investigation into the Trump-Russia probe reportedly has John Brennan and James Clapper in its crosshairs.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-631413276-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
