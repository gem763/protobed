A person who consumes drugs or alcohol and then repeatedly gets behind the wheel of a vehicle while impaired demonstrates a character inconsistent with the Nation\u2019s moral standards, because he places not only his life but the lives of innocents on the road in grave danger.\n\n\u201cFabricated\u2019 jurisprudence,'\u201d responded lawyer Ira Kurzban. \u201cAG Barr who may be in jail by the end of the impeachment process got one more shot in against immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh-ha! I see AG Barr dropped 2 decisions just before he called it a day to screw up further ability of immigrants to legalize status,!,\u201d said immigration lawyer Nicolette Glazer. \u201c2 DUIs are now \u201cpresumptively\u201d = to lack of good moral character.\u201d\n\nPractical bottom line: long time residents who are placed in removal proceedings will not even have a chance to apply for relief if they have 2 or more DUIs in the 10 years preceding the master calendar on which the IJ asks \u201cwhat relief is Resp. applying for? \u2026 Meaning of course that ppl will not be able to receive C10 work permits. Which of course is what Stephen Miller & cie is after. They want to prevent ppl from obtaining work permits to force self-deportation. Evil bast*rds.\n\nMany illegals are convicted of drunk driving. For example, Breitbart News reported October 27 the death of two legal immigrants by an illegal who was let stay in the United States:\n\nAn illegal alien in the sanctuary state of Illinois is accused of killing two legal immigrants in a deadly drunk driving crash last week, law enforcement officials say. Juan Rodea-Cruz, a 25-year-old illegal alien, is accused of killing 26-year-old Marko Boskovic, a legal immigrant from Serbia, and 25-year-old Laura Uribe, a legal immigrant from Colombia, in a drunk driving crash on October 20 while driving the wrong way down a highway in Clarendon Hills, Illinois. Rodea-Cruz \u2014 whom the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has requested custody of \u2014 was found with multiple open, unopened, and broken liquor bottles in his vehicle, according to the DuPage County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nLong-term illegals who face deportation can ask a judge for \u201ccancellation of removal.\u201d If approved, the cancellation allows them to stay in the United States, to get a \u201cc10\u201d work permit, and also get green cards. But Barr\u2019s rule will deny that benefit to migrants who have gotten two or more DUIs.\n\nRoughly 4,000 people get \u201cCancellation of Removal\u201d per year, according to Barr\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe green card path AG Barr is limiting is available to unauthorized immigrants who have been in the country for 10+ years\u2014 i.e. over 60% of the unauthorized population,\u201d said immigration lawyer Sarah Pierce.\n\n\u201cNot just one benefit: determination of good moral character, which is required for many applications and it also references discretion \u2013 which is pretty much all applications.\u201d said immigration lawyer Bridget Cambria.\n\nCancellation of removal is just one of many hidden pathways through the nation\u2019s complex immigraiton rules. The paths have been cut by legislators, judges, business groups, progressives \u2014 and also by the immigration lawyers who guide people through the pathways, for a fee.\n\nImmigration Numbers:\n\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.\n\nBut the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants. It also adds replacement workers to a resident population of more than 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and about 500,000 blue-collar H-2B, H-2A, and J-1 visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners, and it rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.\n\nThis policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.\n\nThe federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college educations.\n\nThe cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.\n\nThe labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy.\n\nThe Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.", "description": "illegal immigants who have two or more drunk-driving convictions should be allowed to stay in the United States, say pro-migration lawyers.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/drunk-driving-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
