Having trail mails or lots of messaging back and forth is not going to ensure everyone who needs to be in the know has all the relevant details. Having a wedding website is the solution. A one-stop-space with all relevant information is ideal. Here are the deets you need to know about having a wedding website.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the details\n\nThe \u2018who, what, when, where\u2019 of the wedding need to be put up on the website. The details like time, venue of the main ceremony along with the pre-wedding ceremonies should be mentioned. If there is a wedding theme, talk about that. You could also give some suggestions and ideas of how to stick to the theme with what they wear. Also, give details about accommodation and travel \u2013 suggestions, potential discounts available, etc.\n\nDon\u2019t overcomplicate\n\nThe website itself should be easy to go through. Not something that has too many links between pages. Lots of to-and-fro between pages to get the details will put people viewing the website off. Use a simple chic design.\n\nRSVP and security\n\nIsn\u2019t it easier to have a consolidated list of all your guests who have confirmed? And isn\u2019t it easier for the guests to click on a button and RSVP instead of having to write back to you. Just ensure that the RSVP section is only for those who have been invited. In fact, why not keep a password locked website? Share the link of the website along with a password to your guests? This way all the details are not disclosed to the one and all \u2013 beyond your intended guest list.\n\nGuidelines and galleries\n\nIf you have any specifications for your wedding \u2013 hashtags, mobile usage, etc \u2013 its best to clarify it and inform the guests. Have the information available on the website. You can also have a space for photo gallery where your pre-wedding photos, engagement photos can be uploaded before the wedding, and after the wedding, you can have the photos of the wedding put up so that the guests get to see them too.", "description": "If you\u2019re looking to make a wedding website for your upcoming nuptials, then here\u2019s what you need to know.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/sthbridalaslisona1570184268.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
