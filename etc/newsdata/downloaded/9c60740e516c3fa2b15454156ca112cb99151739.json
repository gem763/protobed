Its cardiovascular drug Brilinta also reduced the risk of death and heart attack by 10%.\n\nGold miner Centamin climbed 1.1% as the company continued its reshuffle, adding two new executive directors to the board. The FTSE 250 company expects a stronger second half of the year from its Sukari gold mine in Egypt.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 02, 2019 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
