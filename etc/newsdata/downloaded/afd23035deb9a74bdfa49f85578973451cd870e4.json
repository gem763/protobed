Similar to Apple\u2019s statement last night, Cook claims that the app \u2014 a crowdsourced mapping tool that\u2019s become useful amid the ongoing protests in Hong Kong \u2014 was being misused in ways that could threaten public safety.\n\n\u201cThe app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints, protest hotspots, and other information,\u201d Cook wrote. \u201cOn its own, this information is benign. However, over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.\u201d\n\nCook\u2019s full email is below. It was initially published by HKmap.live\u2019s developers, and Daring Fireball\u2019s John Gruber has vouched for its authenticity.\n\nTeam, You have likely seen the news that we made the decision to remove an app from the App Store entitled HKmap.live. These decisions are never easy, and it is harder still to discuss these topics during moments of furious public debate. It\u2019s out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision. It is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill. This case is no different. The app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints, protest hotspots, and other information. On its own, this information is benign. However, over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law. Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm. We built the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for every user. It\u2019s a responsibility that we take very seriously, and it\u2019s one that we aim to preserve. National and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts. In this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users. Tim\n\nCook\u2019s email doesn\u2019t offer any specifics on these incidents where HKmap.live was supposedly used to target individual police officers. It\u2019s an alarming scenario, as is the idea that people would use the mapping app nefariously to pounce on areas with low police presence. But it\u2019s mostly been state-run media in China pushing these frightening reports so far.\n\nHKmap.live\u2019s developers have pushed back against Apple\u2019s claims and reiterated that the app aggregates and consolidates information from users, news sources, and social networks like Facebook and Telegram. HKmap.live never displays a lack of police on its map, only areas where they\u2019ve congregated.\n\n5. Most of the contents are user-generated, and we allow users to down vote for moderator review.

It initially pulled HKmap.live from the App Store earlier this month only to say that the removal was a mistake. But after briefly restoring it, Apple pulled down the app again last night and offered the reasoning that Cook has now doubled down \u2014 without providing any examples of unlawful incidents that HKmap.live has helped facilitate.\n\nAs of now, the app continues to function for people who already have it installed on their iPhones, but it cannot be redownloaded from Apple.", "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has sent an email to employees with more details on why the company chose to remove HKmap.live, a crowdsourced mapping tool that\u2019s proven helpful during mass protests in Hong Kong, from the App Store.
