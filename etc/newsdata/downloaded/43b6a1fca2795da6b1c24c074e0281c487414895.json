U.S. GCcv1 were steady at $1,474.40.\n\n\"There seem to be some headlines people are reading positively on the trade front, which is also supporting the dollar, so that's naturally weighing on the gold market,\" said OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam.\n\n\"Price action seen over the past week made the $1,480 support level very vulnerable. Gold broke that level yesterday and it's capitalising on those moves to push further down. There is room for plenty more declines over the next few weeks.\"\n\nThe dollar held firm on Tuesday after posting its biggest quarterly gain in more than a year, with encouraging U.S. economic data leading markets to scale back expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months. FRX/\n\nThat has weighed on gold because lower interest rates cut the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.\n\n\"(A) less accommodative Fed implies a stronger U.S. dollar and higher U.S. yields, which are the absolute worst bedfellows for gold markets,\" AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes said in a note.\n\nBullion has lost nearly $100 since scaling a peak of $1,557 early September, largely owing to an uptick in the dollar.\n\nIt is still up 14% this year, with earlier gains driven by an escalation in the U.S.-China trade conflict, concerns over global economic growth and the prospects for monetary easing by central banks.\n\nMore positive signs on trade have weighed on the metal of late. The White House dismissed reports that the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges as \"fake news\", bolstering risk sentiment.
