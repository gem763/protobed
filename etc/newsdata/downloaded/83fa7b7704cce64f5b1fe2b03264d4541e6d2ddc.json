Elizabeth Warren in Texas, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Biden was the top choice of 28% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, followed by Ms. Warren of Massachusetts at 18% and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas at 12% apiece, according to the poll.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren\u2019s popularity continues to grow in Texas as well as nationally. But in either case, the changes are small, and Biden holds on to his double-digit lead,\u201d said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Peter A. Brown.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris of California was at 5%, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro were at 3% apiece, and Sen.

Warren is the candidate of Democrats\u2019 hearts \u2014 they say two-to-one she has the best ideas \u2014 while Biden is the candidate of Democrats\u2019 heads, with a five-to-one lead over Warren when it comes to who has the best chance to win against Trump,\u201d Mr. Brown said.\n\nAmong all registered voters, President Trump had a 45% job approval rating in the state, compared to 50% who said they disapprove. Nearly half \u2014 48% \u2014 said they definitely would not vote for Mr. Trump is he was the Republican nominee, compared to 35% who said they would definitely vote for him and 14% who said they would consider voting for him.\n\nThe overall survey of 1,410 self-identified registered voters in the state was taken from Sept. 4-9 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe subsample of 456 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
