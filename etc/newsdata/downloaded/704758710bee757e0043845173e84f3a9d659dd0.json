Telling it can have positive benefits. But the benefits are unpredictable and marginal, whereas the harm could be more substantial.\"\n\nTaken together, some of the details Trump revealed could help terrorist groups piece together new information about how U.S. counterterrorism forces gather intelligence and execute such dangerous missions, said veterans of previous operations.\n\n\"I\u2019m surprised that he went into that level of granularity,\u201d said a former senior military officer who has commanded troops in the region and like some others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject.\n\nNagata stressed that Trump is not alone in the practice. He cited the 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, which was recounted in significant detail at the time by Obama administration officials.\n\n\"This tradition two administrations have established of talking about the details of missions like these may actually make them more dangerous and more difficult in the future,\u201d said Nagata, who was also the senior U.S. military officer in Pakistan at the time of the Bin Laden mission.\n\nHere are a few examples of what Trump shared on Sunday that have been raising eyebrows.\n\nThe intelligence\n\nTrump didn\u2019t offer specifics about how the U.S. located Baghdadi. But he keyed in on the highly sensitive discipline of signals intelligence \u2014 or the remote monitoring of enemy communications \u2014 that struck several with deep experience as better left alone.\n\n\u201cThese people are very smart, they\u2019re not into cell phones anymore,\" Trump said. \"They're not \u2014 they're very technically brilliant. You know, they use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump. But they use the internet incredibly well.\"\n\n\"Why mention it?\u201d asked Nagata. \"It could contribute to a reverse engineering of our intelligence methods by the adversary, and if there\u2019s any possibility of that, why do it?\u201d\n\nTrump also described the layout of the compound. \"The tunnels were dead end for the most part,\" he recounted. \"There was one we think that wasn\u2019t but we had that covered too,\u201d he said, seemingly suggesting the U.S. mapped the tunnel network ahead of time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit sensitive,\u201d said a former special operations commander who also asked that he not be identified. \u201cThe enemy knows to some degree that we have technology that can detect that. But they don\u2019t know how it\u2019s done or how good we are at, and we don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something the president should not have said about the target development,\u201d added Eric Robinson, a former Army officer who held positions in intelligence and special operations forces until last year. \u201cIt\u2019s reckless. But it\u2019s not as bad as hanging the satellite image of the Iranian space launch site two months ago. That was bad.\u201d\n\nThe raid\n\nTrump also specified the number of helicopters the commandos used \u2014 eight \u2014 and reported that, upon landing, the commandos \u201cblew holes into the side of the building, not wanting to go through the main door because that was booby-trapped.\u201d\n\n\u201cAircraft counts and means of conducting a breach are [tactics, techniques and procedures] that special operations forces have developed and learned the hard way,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t helpful to talk about.\u201d\n\n\"The enemy sees the scene after, they\u2019re on the ground, they see the breaching holes in building \u2014 but come on, let them figure it out on their own, don\u2019t tell them,\" one of the former special operations commanders remarked.\n\nTrump also said the commandos were in the compound for two hours.\n\n\"There\u2019s no reason to reveal that,\u201d the former special operations commander added. \u201cYou\u2019re giving them another way to think about how long forces on the ground are vulnerable. Timing on an objective is something where you never want the bad guys to know what your procedure was or how long it took.\u201d\n\nWhat was seized\n\nBefore departing, the American commandos gathered intelligence, Trump said, noting some of the seized files included information on \u201cISIS\u2019 origins, future plans, things that we very much want.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s well known that U.S. troops are trained to gather whatever new information they can from such operations; a treasure trove of intelligence was pilfered from the bin Laden raid, much of it declassified in the decade since.\n\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t need to know what we took out of there,\" said the former special operations commander.\n\nThe helicopters' route\n\nFinally, when the helicopters carrying the commandos and their haul took off, they \u201ctook an identical route\u201d back to friendly territory, Trump revealed.\n\nThat detail bothered the former military officials more than any of the others. \u201cThat\u2019s the most worrisome,\" said Nagata. \"The force is vulnerable throughout the operation, but arrival and departure by helicopter are very dangerous. For me, the idea that anyone would talk publicly about how we did the most dangerous part of the operation \u2014 the risks far outweigh the storytelling value.\u201d\n\n\"I don\u2019t know why the f--- he would say that, honestly,\u201d fumed the other former special operations commander. \u201cIf we\u2019re doing the same approaches and egresses, that can get helicopters shot down. It\u2019s happened in Afghanistan.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/aa/1c/07bc98ca4040b83c202707ba4db4/20191027-village-raid-baghdadi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
