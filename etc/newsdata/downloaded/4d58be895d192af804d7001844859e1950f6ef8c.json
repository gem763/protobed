The Reds are six points above champions Manchester City and look well on course for their first league title for 30 years.\n\nDespite losing their 100 per cent record with a draw against Manchester United last Sunday, Jurgen Klopp\u2019s men got back to winning ways with a 4-1 Champions League victory over Genk during the week.\n\nWith Liverpool managing to score three or more in three of their last four home games, Tottenham should be worried.\n\nBetfair have Over 3.5 Goals at 11/8 while Liverpool to win 3-0 is 11/1.\n\nTottenham\u2019s turning point?\n\nTottenham\u2019s season hasn\u2019t really got started and it seems the magic of Mauricio Pochettino may be starting to fade.\n\nSpurs are 13 points behind Liverpool after just nine games and their form has suffered in all competitions.\n\nA controversial VAR decision and subsequent Dele Alli goal rescued a point at home against Watford, but most importantly saved them from their fourth loss of the season.\n\nTottenham have not won at Anfield in their last nine attempts but a 5-0 win against Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League will have boosted their confidence.\n\nLiverpool drawing at United showed that the right tactical set-up can stifle the Reds going forward and leave them vulnerable on the break.\n\nBetfair are offering Tottenham to win 1-0, 2-0 or 2-1 at 8/1.\n\nHowever, a heavy loss for Spurs would see the pressure mount on Pochettino with Betfair offering 5/2 on the Argentinian being the next manager to leave his post.\n\nSalah, Mane or Kane?\n\nLiverpool against Tottenham has been a great fixture over the last few years thanks to the attacking threats that both teams pose.\n\nMohamed Salah and Sadio Mane were both on target against Genk, taking their season tallies to seven and nine respectively.\n\nEgyptian international Salah has scored six times in nine appearances against Spurs and is 16/5 to score first and 10/11 anytime with Betfair.\n\nMane has kept up his incredible form from last season that saw him share the Golden Boot with Salah and Arsenal\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\n\nWith only five Premier League goals so far, Mane will be desperate to find the net against Tottenham, and is 9/2 to score first.\n\nHarry Kane has continued to find the net with regularity this season despite Tottenham\u2019s issues.\n\nThe Spurs captain has 15 goals for club and country and to open the scoring at Anfield he is 13/2.\n\nBetfair are also offering Salah, Mane and Kane to all score anytime at 10/1.", "description": "Betting preview as Liverpool and Tottenham face off for the first time since the Champions League final with the Reds on form but Spurs looking fragile.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/betting/Better-Collective/spurs-players-disappointed-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
