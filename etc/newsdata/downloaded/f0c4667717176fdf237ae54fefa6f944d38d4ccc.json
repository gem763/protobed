Their School Ignored, Lawsuit Alleges.", "language": "en", "text": "Some white students at Chaska High School in Minnesota ended last school year the same way they began it: In photos, wearing blackface.\n\nThe academic year in the 28,000-person suburb began in September 2018 with white students attending a football game in blackface, and, in one student\u2019s case, an afro. In December, a middle school student in the same district\u2014located roughly 30 miles southwest of Minneapolis\u2014found that his gym shirt had been stolen, vandalized with the n-word, and returned to his locker. In February 2019, two white students in the district put on charcoal face masks and put the photos on social media with the hashtag: #blackface.\n\nThat same month, another student allegedly posted on Snapchat, holding a gun, and threatened to shoot a list of students if they attended a Chaska High School assembly on race relations. In April, white students posted an image on Snapchat with the faces of 25 African-American students, calling the location \u201cNegro Hill.\u201d\n\nThe lede on a local news story in April began: \u201cChaska, it happened again. Another racially charged incident in Eastern Carver County Public Schools.\u201d\n\nAnd by the time a photo of a student wearing blackface appeared in the yearbook in May, the response from parents on the newly created Equity Task Force was: \u201cNot again, are you serious? The same exact issue of blackface again?\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, they\u2019d had enough.\n\nSix current and former students from the district filed a 50-page civil-rights lawsuit in federal court against Independent School District 112, also known as Eastern Carver County Schools, claiming that teachers and administrators demonstrated \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d and failed to take \u201cany meaningful action\u201d in response to repeated complaints of racist bullying.\n\nThe school district \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to black students who were called the n-word, \u201cmonkey,\u201d told they \u201cdon\u2019t belong,\u201d and threatened with physical violence, the lawsuit claims.\n\n\u201cSchool staff have little, if any, proper training or experience with respect to properly responding to reports of racism,\u201d according to the complaint, which alleges that \u201coften times, complaints of discrimination are simply met by silence.\u201d\n\nStudents of color were even prohibited from posting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs and materials featuring African-American leaders during Black History Month, the lawsuit states.\n\nFour of the six students in the lawsuit relocated from the district as a direct result of the racism they experienced over the past few years, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Minneapolis Star-Tribune first reported the legal action, which followed months of pressure from parents in the school district, where only 3 percent of students are black, per data from the Office of Civil Rights.\n\nAmanda Flowers Peterson told the Star-Tribune last month that her 6-year-old son was punched in the face\u2014twice\u2014by a classmate and \u201ctold he doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d Administrators declined to call the incident racially motivated, she said.\n\nPeterson and her husband are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which says that they removed their son from the district after repeated concerns about neglect\u2014including an incident where he was allegedly left unsupervised for 45 minutes after he was sent home on the wrong bus and another where he was sent outside for recess for 20 minutes in 23-degree weather with no coat on.\n\nSchools officials called Amanda Peterson, who is black, \u201ctoo aggressive\u201d when she complained, the lawsuit states. In May 2019, a substitute teacher with the district \u201ccontacted Ms. Peterson\u2019s employer and demanded she be fired\u201d over her advocacy efforts to correct the racism that had systematically affected the district, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe six students are seeking a jury trial to determine damages in excess of $75,000 over the mental anguish and emotional distress caused by the racism at the school district.\n\n\u201cAt some point, enough is enough,\u201d attorney Anna Prakash, who represents some of the families, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOur public schools are supposed to respect and keep children safe while creating an educational environment in which they can thrive. That didn\u2019t happen for African-American students in Chaska,\u201d said Prakash.\n\n\u201cOur clients tried and continue to try to get help from the administration,\u201d said Prakash, \u201cBut, with all they have experienced and because meaningful change has not happened, they filed this lawsuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a pervasive problem and it goes back years,\u201d she added. \u201cThese students and their parents are incredibly brave.\u201d\n\nPrakash said none of the families involved in the lawsuit were available to comment to The Daily Beast by press time.\n\n\u2018LEAVE NOW\u2019\n\nThe allegations in the lawsuit involve students as young as six and up through seniors in high school who are now adults.\n\nA former student at Chaska Middle School East, identified in the lawsuit only by \u201cT.B.,\u201d recalled that white students at his school kicked him in the knees and called him \u201cmonkey,\u201d sometimes even writing the word on his school folders and placing a picture of a monkey on his desk.\n\nWhite students allegedly smashed T.B.\u2019s computer, told him that he stinks, and repeatedly told him that his dad \u201cis a drug dealer or rapper, saying that is what all black dads are,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn December, students took T.B.\u2019s gym shirt out of his locker and wrote the n-word on it, along with \u201cleave now.\u201d Since T.B. was \u201cworried about the cost of a new T-shirt, he put the T-shirt on and put a sweatshirt over it,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nWhen he reported the vandalism to the school\u2019s assistant principal, he was given a new shirt and an email was sent to his mother, which spelled out the slur. \u201cIt was very vague, very cold and no apology or how they were going to handle it going forward other than we got him a new T-shirt,\u201d T.B.\u2019s mother said in a local news interview.\n\n\u201cThe city... looks at kids of color differently than kids that walk around with white skin,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think their staff is equipped at the school to handle it or know how in the right way. And I think they\u2019d rather just keep pushing it under the rug.\u201d\n\nT.B.\u2019s parents pulled him and his siblings out of the district.\n\nJquan Fuller-Rueschman, a former Chaska High student who left the school midway through his senior year, said in the lawsuit that he was punched in the face by a white student, repeatedly called the n-word, accused of being stupid and dumb, had food thrown at him, and had his car egged. He was labeled \u201caggressive\u201d and suspended after confronting a student who repeatedly called him the n-word, the complaint states.\n\nWhen he was on the football team in October 2016, Jquan said he was threatened by a white teammate who said he would \u201cbring a gun to shoot you.\u201d The coach allegedly responded by noting that \u201call of the drama seems to involve you.\u201d\n\nEven after he left the school in September 2018, Jquan\u2019s was one of the 25 student faces superimposed on the Google map labeled \u201cNegro Hill\u201d by white Chaska students, the lawsuit contends.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like black people,\u201d then-sophomore Darius Stewart, whose face was also on the map, told a local news station . \u201cThey want us gone. I mean, I am hopeful but I don\u2019t think racism is going to stop.\u201d\n\nSeveral current and former high school students in the lawsuit expressed that they felt \u201cunwelcome\u201d and unsafe attending school. One former student was hospitalized last school year over severe anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts, which she linked to racism at school.\n\nAfter the yearbook printed the photo of a student in blackface, Assistant Principal Jim Swearingen said in a letter to the school community claiming that administrators had \u201ctalked\u201d about \u201cthe racist history behind wearing blackface.\u201d\n\nBut Tonya Coleman, one of the parents who filed suit on Tuesday, disagreed with Swearingen\u2019s interpretation of events. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had any dialogue about it all, according to many, many parents,\u201d she told the Star-Tribune in the spring.\n\nSwearingen\u2019s letter said that school officials discovered the image after the book was printed but before it was distributed and that the administration does not \u201ccondone the ridicule or demeaning of humans, particularly our own students\u201d and apologized for the \u201cdelay in our yearbook distribution.\u201d\n\nIn April, concerned parents in the district formed a group called Residents Organizing Against Racism (ROAR) and created a petition for the removal of Chaska High School\u2019s principal. The petition, which was signed by more than 700 people, also called for a zero-tolerance anti-racism policy and significant changes to the curriculum.\n\nJenna Cruz, a 34-year-old mother of three biracial kids in Chaska, who is part of ROAR, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that the district\u2019s responses have failed to even use the word \u201cracism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s labelled as bullying and inappropriate behavior,\u201d said Cruz, who has two elementary-school-aged children. ROAR currently has about 126 parents and community members who are helping organize, she added.\n\nCruz said that her children have not yet been directly affected by the incidents named in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to experience this,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t sit back and do nothing and watch kids just be harmed by going to school. Whether it\u2019s my kid or someone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t hold the school accountable for the students\u2019 actions, but the school is responsible for their reaction to it, and how they communicate that to parents,\u201d she added. \u201cThe significance of not relaying this information to parents so that they can protect their children is negligence. There\u2019s no grey area in this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a shift in the climate in the last two years, and there\u2019s been this emboldened voice for people acting like this is OK,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cI\u2019m not shocked, but what was shocking is the lack of appropriate response from the administrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a large [group] that stands in solidarity with the brave parents and students that are doing this lawsuit,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cThey made the decision to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nLast month, ROAR invited Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to speak to the community.\n\n\u201cI have read about some things I find deeply disturbing,\u201d Ellison, who is black, said at the 90-minute meeting on August 20, cautioning the 30 parents in attendance not to give up on \u201cany of these knuckleheads.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak up even if your voice quivers,\u201d he said to the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t let the ugly ideas soak into the soil.\u201d\n\nThe district declined to comment on specific litigation to The Daily Beast but forwarded an open letter that Superintendent Clint Christopher wrote to Ellison on Aug. 26, after his visit, which claimed that the school board and district staff \u201care committed to an educational environment where all students feel safe, welcome, and included, and have the tools and resources to succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not yet realized that for every student, and have been working in earnest to move the needle and improve outcomes for every child that walks through our doors,\u201d Christopher said.\n\nChristopher\u2019s letter noted that the district hired a new director of equity and inclusion this summer, that 40 district and building administrative leaders have in recent months participated in more than two days of training based on the University of Minnesota\u2019s Urban Leadership Academy, and that the district has formed an Equity Advisory Council of parents and community members.\n\nThe district also hired a \u201cnationally-recognized researcher\u201d to conduct an audit of \u201cour policies, practices, and performance data using an equity lens,\u201d which will conclude this month, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is important work, it\u2019s the right work, and we are all committed to doing better for each student,\u201d said Christopher. \u201cThey\u2019re the reason we\u2019re here.\u201d", "description": "Six students, ages 7 to 18, filed a civil-rights suit against their school, claiming administrators exhibited \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to repeated complaints of racist bullying.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567622121/190904-messer-chaksa-tease_kmvo34"}
