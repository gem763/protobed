History is full of such ironies and tragedies.\"", "description": "Nearly two-thirds of Leave voters say Boris Johnson would be at least partly responsible if he seeks a Brexit delay beyond October.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c486de6a38142f1569766?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
