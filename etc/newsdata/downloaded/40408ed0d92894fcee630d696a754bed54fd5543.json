They have remained at the top every day for 15 years.\n\nRonaldo scored both goals in the 2002 World Cup final but never lifted the Champions League\n\nMessi has four Champions League titles, although CR7 is the competition's all-time top scorer\n\n'However, if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo.'\n\nThe prodigy moved to Inter Milan, who Mourinho would later manage after Ronaldo had left, the following season, but the memories of watching Brazil's second-highest all-time goalscorer still leave his former coach starstruck.\n\nMourinho has watched at close quarters as the two great strikers of the current era, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, have terrorised defences with a longevity his former charge was denied.\n\nRonaldo had a prolific stay at Real Madrid between 2002 and 2007 but retired four years later\n\nThe Portugal captain won the inaugural Nations League but is still chasing a World Cup victory\n\nMessi and Ronaldo's careers have not been blighted by the injury problems the Brazilian faced\n\nMourinho has been in demand for his opinions since departing Man United in December 2018\n\nRonaldo's trophy haul Campeonato Paulista: 2009 (Corinthians) La Liga: 2003 (Barca) World Cup: 1994, 2002 (Brazil) Copa America: 1997, 1999 (Brazil) UEFA Cup: 1998 (Inter) UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 1997 (Barca) FIFA World Player of the Year: 1996 1997, 2002 Ballon d'Or: 1997, 2002 World Cup Golden Boot: 2002\n\nPlagued by knee injuries, including a rupture that forced him to miss almost three seasons after moving to Inter, Ronaldo played fewer than 450 games in his career, but still won the World Cup twice with Brazil, in 1994 and 2002.\n\nHis club career came nowhere near the incredible consistency of CR7 and Messi, who have won the Champions League 11 times between them and become by far the leading all-time scorers in the competition.\n\nThe closest Ronaldo came to winning the exalted trophy was a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup win in 1997 and UEFA Cup glory with Inter in 1998.\n\nNeither Messi nor Ronaldo have lifted the World Cup, although the Juventus forward won EURO 2016 and this year's inaugural Nations League with Portugal.\n\nMourinho, whose relationship with fellow Portuguese Ronaldo was questioned during their time together at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013, led Inter to a 3-2 Champions League semi-final win over Barcelona and Messi in 2010.", "description": "The 'Special One', who left Manchester United ten months ago, has named the Brazilian Ronaldo as the greatest player he has worked with, having coached him at Barcelona.", "authors": ["Ben Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/14/19625420-0-image-a-17_1570887660275.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
