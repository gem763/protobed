Individual school leaders or LA representatives were concerned that parents could make \u2018knee-jerk\u2019 decisions,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe findings prompted Ms Spielman to warn that \u201cschools, local authorities and parents need to work together before such a decision is made, to make sure that home education is genuinely in the interests of children and not just the best thing for schools or parents\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Participants were aware that schools can also apply pressure to parents or children indirectly.\u201d\n\nJulie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cHome education, when entered into for the right reasons, can be a positive choice for families. However, this report suggests that some children may be being educated at home for reasons that are not in their best interests.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously concerning, particularly given that this particularly, according to the report, affects children with complex needs.\u201d", "description": "Parents could be making \u201cknee-jerk\u201d decisions to educate their children at home, according to a new report from the schools watchdog,\u00a0as numbers choosing the alternative path surged\u00a0by more than one-quarter in a year.
