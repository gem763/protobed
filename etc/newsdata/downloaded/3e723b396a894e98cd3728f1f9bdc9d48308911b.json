(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nAs rescue crews continue to look for and evacuate people from the devastated islands of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama, relatives and friends are trying desperately to find loved ones in the Bahamas amid the chaos of recovery after Hurricane Dorian.\n\nAccess to the battered northern islands, where the storm caused catastrophic damage, has been limited. Search and rescue teams, including the U.S. Coast Guard and the British Royal Navy, were on the islands Wednesday trying to find survivors.\n\nBut amid communication lapses and widespread decimation, news about individuals is slow to arrive and difficult to find, so thousands of people have taken to social media to track down their kin.\n\n[Massive rescue and relief effort underway in ravaged Bahamas as Dorian aims at Carolinas]\n\nOne site \u2014 DorianPeopleSearch.com \u2014 started trying to help on Sunday night, in the middle of the storm, when a Realtor in Nassau said she saw a growing need even while the hurricane was still hitting the islands. Vanessa Pritchard-Ansell said Facebook groups of worried people had grown so numerous and unwieldy that it made finding names of those missing difficult. A Google Docs spreadsheet had grown to 40 pages and was difficult to navigate, she said.\n\n\u201cEach of those Facebook pages had a purpose, people asking for information about their loved ones,\u201d Pritchard-Ansell said. \u201cMy concern was that the purpose would get lost.\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday, friends and family members had posted the names of more than 5,500 people on Pritchard-Ansell\u2019s site. She said she is working with the U.S. and Canadian embassies to cross-check names with citizens of those countries.\n\n\n\nCatherine Russel, right, is greeted by a loved one in Nassau after arriving with other survivors of Hurricane Dorian on Wednesday.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nShe has an international team of volunteers helping.\n\n\u201cI know this kind of thing has been done before,\u201d she said. \u201cA guy from Spain reached out to me, and he had done something like this for a different hurricane, so it all came together.\u201d\n\nThe Bahamian government created a form for people to complete that asks detailed questions. DorianPeopleSearch is stripped down and basic: the name of the missing person, the town where they were believed to be before the storm, and their status \u2014 known or, in the vast majority of the 5,557 names, unknown. The names are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nIf there\u2019s a critical need for evacuation, that is noted as well by whoever is posting the name. And some names are linked to Facebook groups.\n\nOne woman was listed as \u201clast seen \u2014 Murphy Town by Change Ministries Church \u2014 needs insulin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been people on dialysis; there was a woman in labor,\u201d Pritchard-Ansell said. \u201cAnother woman who had a 5-week-old baby.\u201d\n\nJust a few missing people on the website are in the \u201cstatus: known\u201d category.\n\n\u201cWhen you see that somebody has been found and their family knows where they are, you feel a moment of elation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you also know that there are so many thousands of others who have not been accounted for.\u201d\n\nIt might be small comfort to frantic loved ones, but the number of people reported missing in the initial hours after a hurricane typically goes down dramatically in the ensuing days, when power and communications are restored and people can more easily find one another and use cellphones and the Internet to reconnect. The Bahamian government has thus far listed 20 recorded deaths as a result of Hurricane Dorian, but they caution that the number probably will rise as authorities reach decimated areas of the islands.\n\n\n\nThe aftermath on Great Abaco. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThere are approximately 70,000 people who live on the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama combined. It is unclear how many were able to evacuate particularly vulnerable areas, such as the Mudd, a low-lying shantytown in Marsh Harbour that authorities said was decimated.\n\nU.S. and U.K. rescuers are assisting the Bahamian government in searching for survivors, many of whom will be brought to safer spots on the southern islands. Pritchard-Ansell is also working with Trans Island Airways to get names of people they are evacuating.\n\nTIA operations manager James Ingraham said search and rescue operations have been difficult because of the devastation \u2014 Freeport\u2019s airport was destroyed. Getting information about where people are \u2014 and if they are stranded \u2014 is a challenge.\n\n\u201cOur priority is getting people to safety,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to let family members know that their loved one survived, to give them some reassurance. That\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nPritchard-Ansell said her family was safe in Nassau: \u201cWe barely got a surface scratch here.\u201d But she said she knew even before Dorian left the islands \u2014 and it took 48 hours for it to finally pass \u2014 there would be a great need for information about those in hard-hit areas.\n\n\n\nA marina on Great Abaco. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nShe said a simple, easy-to-use website seemed liked the best, just listing names and hometowns.\n\n\u201cOn the islands, the degree of separation is really quite small,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone knows everyone or is a friend of a friend.\u201d\n\nConcerned people in the United States are using the site as well. Jeff Williams, 26, lives in Broward County, Fla., and has been looking for news about his fiancee, Deneze Bootle, 20, for days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on Instagram, I tried to join Facebook groups, but it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve used it that I forgot my password,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m just looking up every little database and Google Doc and whatever I can find to get news about her. I\u2019m checking every hour, and trying to call the embassy. I haven\u2019t heard a thing yet.\u201d\n\nBootle is listed on DorianPeopleSearch as being in Murphy Town on Abaco, where her family lives. Abaco was among the areas hardest hit by Dorian.\n\n\u201cI talked to her on Saturday. We were talking about just regular stuff, making each other laugh,\u201d Williams said. \u201cShe told me she would charge her phone before the hurricane. The next thing you know, the hurricane hits and just sits on top of the island. Then the images started coming in, and I started to cry.\u201d\n\nHe said Bootle had recently graduated from Bahamas University in Nassau and was home visiting family. Williams said he bought an engagement ring but had not yet officially proposed.\n\n\u201cDeneze is my soul mate.\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd now I don\u2019t know what to do. I just keep checking and hoping that I\u2019ll find her. And I keep praying, and crying, and hoping those tears will lead her back.\u201d\n\nRozsa is a freelance journalist based in Florida.", "description": "A website trying to help locate survivors has more than 5,500 entries.
