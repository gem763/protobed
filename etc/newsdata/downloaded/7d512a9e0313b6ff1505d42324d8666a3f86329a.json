(AP) \u2014 In one of the videos, a small object streaks across the sky before the U.S. Navy fighter jet\u2019s tracking system locks on and follows it.\n\n\u201cWhoa. Got it,\u201d the pilot yells, laughing as the dot moves on his screen. \u201cWoohoo!\u201d\n\nAnother pilot asks: \u201cWow. What is that, man?\u201d\n\nThe Navy isn\u2019t offering an explanation \u2014 at least not publicly \u2014 for exactly what that object was. But the service is confirming the authenticity of that video and two others taken from its planes in 2004 and 2015.\n\nThe release of the videos, which have been circulating online and in news reports, was not authorized, Navy officials said. But the footage has prompted the Navy to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation into sightings by its pilots of what it describes as \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d or UAPs in U.S. airspace on both coasts.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to try to characterize anything that may have been seen out there,\u201d Navy Spokesman Joseph Gradisher said. \u201cBut the number of sightings has increased since about 2014 when the advent of new technologies such as drones and quadcopters have come into being.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers are calling for more information on the so-called UAPs, saying some of their movements seem to challenge the laws of physics.\n\n\u201cBased on pilot accounts, encounters with these UAPs often involved complex flight patterns and advanced maneuvering, which demand extreme advances in quantum mechanics, nuclear science, electromagnetics and thermodynamics,\u201d North Carolina Congressman Mark Walker wrote in a letter to Navy Secretary Richard Spencer in July.\n\n\u201cIf the accounts are true, the unidentified crafts could pose a serious security risk to our military personnel and defense apparatus,\u201d wrote Walker, a Republican on the U.S. House\u2019s Homeland Security Committee. \u201cThey could also represent a tremendous opportunity for advancements in science in technology that can contribute to the public good.\u201d\n\nThe Navy is updating its guidelines to encourage pilots to more thoroughly report what they see, Gradisher said. And Navy investigators have been traveling to bases such as Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where squadrons of F/A-18 Super Hornets are based, to talk to aviators.\n\n\u201cWe need reports and data and things we can analyze, and that\u2019s where our aviators come into play,\u201d Gradisher said. \u201cWe need them to participate. In years past they didn\u2019t necessarily do that because there was a stigma to reporting on something being unidentified.\u201d\n\nGradisher said the issue, ultimately, is the safety and security of the Navy\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cOur aviators train as they fight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t like the idea of someone or something observing how we train.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
