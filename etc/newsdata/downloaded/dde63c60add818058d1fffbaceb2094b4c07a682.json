We stayed for over an hour and it were brilliant.\n\nA LANKY REUNION\n\nTalking of great West Indians I attended a 75th birthday party for Clive Lloyd in the Long Room at Lord\u2019s on Saturday and it was great to see old Lancashire colleagues like Farokh Engineer, David Hughes and Jack Simmons. Lots of nostalgia and Brian Lara spoke brilliantly on the history of Caribbean cricket. A memorable night.\n\nBEEFY'S GONE FISHING\n\nEnd of an era with Sir Ian Botham and David Gower leaving Sky. Beefy turned up on Sunday in shorts and a shirt full of fishing flies! David wore a full suit to go out on a formal note after his spectacular sign-off on Saturday when he dropped an F-bomb on air. He apologised on Twitter but it\u2019s a live broadcast and these things can happen.\n\nBeefy's gone fishing for his spectacular Sky sign-off in beautiful shirt and shorts\n\nTHE COCK ISN'T FOR ME\n\nHad a stroll round Kennington and popped into an interesting looking pub called The Cock. There were lads outside in Hawaiian shirts and one of them offered me something called a Jager Bomb \u2014 a tumbler of spirits and Red Bull with a small glass inside it filled with brown liquid. I refused, of course, so this lad drank it and promptly fell over. Not my sort of place.\n\nSMITH FINALLY FALLS\n\nFinally, finally England had a plan for Steve Smith that was successful. They had a slip, fine gully, short catching mid-wicket, deep square leg, deep fine leg and a fine leg slip. And just before that delivery Jos Buttler swapped with Ben Stokes. It\u2019s lovely when a plan comes together \u2014 even if it\u2019s taken the whole series.\n\nIt was nice to see an England plan coming together when Steve Smith finally fell at The Oval\n\nLAST BLAST OF SUMMER\n\nIt\u2019s been a memorable summer but we\u2019re not finished. It\u2019s T20 Blast finals day at Edgbaston on Saturday and I\u2019m delighted all four finalists have English coaches \u2014 Anthony McGrath (Essex), Dominic Cork (Derbyshire), Alex Gidman (Worcs) and Peter Moores (Notts, right). Compare that with the Hundred where there will not be a single home-grown coach. That\u2019s disappointing.\n\nFITTING END TO TERRIFIC SERIES\n\nWhat a spell from Jofra Archer and what a response from Matthew Wade to battle through it. There have been times here and at Old Trafford when Archer was off the pace but he really got Test cricket yesterday and the need to dig deep. I reckon 2-2 was just about right. It\u2019s been a terrific series played to packed houses who love Test cricket.
