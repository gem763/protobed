(Picture: Starbucks/metro.co.uk)\n\nFor some self-proclaimed basics, a traditional Pumpkin Spice Latte just isn\u2019t enough to mark the arrival of autumn.\n\nFor these people, a drink customised to become a secret menu item is the only option.\n\nAfter all, your standard Starbucks cup just won\u2019t cut it on Instagram anymore. You need your beverage to have a catchy name and a label marked with all sorts of complex extras.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t fancy the sound of the Pennywise Frappuccino, the Jack and Sally, the violet drink, or the Cinderella Latte, never fear, for there\u2019s another special autumnal drink waiting for you to try.\n\nThis one is called the Pumpkin Birthday Cake Latte. Handily, it\u2019s actually pretty simple to order, and is meant to taste like a birthday cake mixed with pumpkin spice (as the name would suggest).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s only an option in autumn, though, as you can only order this drink when Starbucks is stocking their pumpkin spice syrup.\n\nSo, here\u2019s how you order.\n\nAsk for a Pumpkin Spice Latte as usual, but for two of the pumpkin sauce pumps to be swapped out for one pump of vanilla and a pump of hazelnut.\n\nIt\u2019s here, it\u2019s really here (Picture: Starbucks)\n\nA PSL usually has four pumps of pumpkin sauce, so this way you\u2019re getting two shots of pumpkin, one vanilla, and one hazelnut.\n\nBustle recommends adding some spice or sprinkles on top for the full birthday cake effect. We\u2019d suggest adding a candle, but that may be a touch too much effort.\n\nFYI, you can pretty much hack any drink to fit your tastebuds \u2013 Starbucks staff are pretty used to people coming in and asking for all sorts of strange stuff.\n\nIf you\u2019re after a way to change up autumn\u2019s pumpkin spice, the good people of the internet have already formulated some winning combinations, though.\n\nIf you don\u2019t fancy the birthday cake twist above, you can give the Pumpkin Spice Chai Latte a go \u2013 just ask for a chai latte with 2 pumps of pumpkin spice sauce and the pumpkin spice topping. Easy.\n\nYou can also try adding toffee nut syrup to a Pumpkin Spice Latte for some nutty goodness, or just add pumpkin spice sauce to a hot chocolate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, you\u2019re not going to run out of ways to enjoy hot seasonal drinks. Happy autumn.\n\nMORE: How to make your coffee habit more sustainable\n\nMORE: Nespresso is making pens out of recycled coffee capsules\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The latest addition to the list of fan-approved Starbucks PSL hacks is one with vanilla and hazelnut shots.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90098680_1571230326.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
