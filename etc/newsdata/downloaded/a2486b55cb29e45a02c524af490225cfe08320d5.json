O\u2019Neal became a spokesperson for Ring in 2016 (before Amazon\u2019s takeover), in exchange for an equity stake in the company.\n\n\u201cRather than join these [police] conventions, where Shaq hands out tens of thousands of dollars of Ring hardware to police officers from around the country, we\u2019d like to offer the basketball legend a chance to talk to privacy experts about the damage these partnerships can do,\u201d the EFF wrote.\n\nO\u2019Neal has previously appeared at Ring events with law enforcement.\n\nFor a long time, Amazon was quiet about details concerning Ring and its partnerships with police departments across the country: how many police departments received Rings; what happened to the data picked up by a Ring; how did the presence of Rings change community interactions internally with neighbors and externally with police? But public records obtained by Motherboard slowly revealed that Amazon was building a surveillance network across the company.\n\nRing is a huge privacy concern because these cameras can collect footage that can then be voluntarily turned over to police without a warrant. The surveillance carried out by these cameras doesn't just affect members of one community, but anyone who happens to pass by without knowing a Ring is watching their every move and without agreeing to that surveillance in the first place.\n\nRing is just one part of Amazon\u2019s growing network of cameras and microphones. So while everyday Amazon is morphing more and more into a nation-state, the EFF is hoping that a very public intervention with Shaq can help turn the tide and raise awareness of how this issue threatens us all.", "description": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation is calling on Shaq to cancel his appearance at a police conference and to stop working with Ring.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daf0c71354287000a09d4af/lede/1571753969911-GettyImages-1169577690.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.845440881763527xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
