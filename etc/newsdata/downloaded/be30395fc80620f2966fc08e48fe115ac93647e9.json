It lessens resentment a lot. If you sleep better you\u2019re going to feel better about each other the next day.\u201d\n\nA lot of people wake up and they\u2019re going on their phones. All of that is actually waking you up a lot more and it can make things a lot worse. Dr Shelby Harris\n\nDoesn\u2019t that feel like a bit of a failure though \u2013 sleeping in separate beds or even separate rooms?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say if you have a husband who\u2019s snoring next to you and he\u2019s not doing anything about it, that\u2019s an issue. It\u2019s a couples issue if he\u2019s not going to go and get it evaluated. But if he\u2019s got it evaluated, is trying treatments but nothing is working and is still snoring and is really putting in a good effort, then maybe you do need to sleep in a separate room. But you\u2019ve got to make sure that things are being tried.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m waking up earlier than I used to \u2013 should I be worried?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a natural change in the circadian rhythms that happens \u2013 our body clocks are earlier when we\u2019re children, they shift later as teenagers and they start to shift earlier as we get older \u2013 don\u2019t fight it. Do something with the time, try not to lie in bed for a few hours trying to force yourself to sleep until nine. You will end up developing insomnia because you\u2019re lying in bed awake, tossing and turning and that worsens your sleep in the long run.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s the ideal sleeping environment?\n\n\u201cI always say make it like a pretty cave - quiet, dark and cool. And that\u2019s really it. If it\u2019s really hard to make your room quiet get a white noise machine \u2013 pink noise is all the rage now. It\u2019s just another level of sound and it tends to have a little bit of a lower spectrum. I use a white noise machine when I travel \u2013 I have an app on my phone that plays in my hotel room.\u201d\n\nEarplugs and a light blocking eye mask might also help you get to sleep. \u201cFoam earplugs aren\u2019t great, they tend to fall out. Silicon ones work better,\u201d says Dr Shelby Harris.\n\nIf the room itself can\u2019t be made dark then you can try light blocking eye shades. And finally, in terms of temperature, Dr Shelby recommends a low temperature: \u201cKeep it as cool as you can. You don\u2019t want to be freezing but if you\u2019re feet get cold you can put on some socks.\u201d\n\nIs it OK to take my phone to bed with me?\n\nWithin an hour of heading off to bed turn off all screens including televisions. \u201cYour brain reads the screen as the sun essentially and makes the hormones in your brain that make you sleepy go away. So go old school \u2013 read a book, listen to the radio, try and do something quiet, calm and relaxing in dim light.\u201d And if you wake up in the night resist the temptation to take a peek at your phone. \u201cA lot of people wake up in the night, their brains are active and they\u2019re going on their phones. All of that is actually waking you up a lot more and it can make things a lot worse.\u201d\n\nListen to Dr Shelby Harris, author of The Women\u2019s Guide to Overcoming Insomnia, talking to presenter Jane Garvey.\n\nWoman's Hour is on BBC Radio 4 on weekdays at 10am and at 4pm on Saturdays.
