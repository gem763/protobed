Then, after catching seven balls and scoring a touchdown, Tom Brady\u2019s security blanket and most trusted receiver, Julian Edelman, was taken out of the game with a chest injury. Now, it remains to be seen how severe that injury is, but the fact remains: The Patriots are running out of reliable receivers. Josh Gordon gets all the headlines, but other than running back checkdowns, who else can Brady throw to if Edelman has to miss time?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEnter: Phillip Dorsett.\n\nPhillip Dorsett is one of my favorite medium and deeper stashes. First-round pedigree. Brady trusts him. Gridlock exists for now, but consider the three guys ahead of him. An opening should come eventually. \u2014 scott pianowski (@scott_pianowski) September 20, 2019\n\nDorsett, outside of Edelman, is the Pats receiver with the most experience in Josh McDaniels\u2019 offense, and he showed off his rapport with Brady against the Jets in Week 3. Seven targets (third on the team behind Gordon and Edelman), six catches, 53 yards, one touchdown, two rushes, 12 yards. He clearly has Brady\u2019s trust and could look at an increased workload going forward, and the fantasy community has taken notice \u2014 his rostership percentage has risen 20% since the AB news dropped.\n\nDarrel Williams, Kansas City Chiefs (5% rostered)\n\nStory continues\n\nYou know the Golden Rule, right? You want to have pieces of the Patrick Mahomes-led offense on your fantasy teams. But with all the pieces on that offense, how do we know who to add and start, especially in the Chiefs\u2019 backfield?\n\nWell, once a rusher on this offense does what Darrell Williams did in Week 3, we pay attention.\n\nChiefs running back snap share:\n\nDarrel Williams - 55%\n\nLesean McCoy - 37%\n\nDarwin Thompson - 8%\n\n\n\nFair to say Darwin was not a natural selection for Andy Reid \u2014 James Koh (@JamesDKoh) September 22, 2019\n\nAfter getting pretty much no work the first two weeks, Williams went off against the Ravens, totaling 109 yards via the air and the ground. Sure, LeSean McCoy got both the TDs, but Williams out-touched him, 14-to-11. Darwin Thompson is looking more and more like the odd man out in this backfield, and with both McCoy and Damien Williams banged up, Darrel could see more days like these going forward.\n\nGardner Minshew, Jacksonville Jaguars (8% rostered)\n\nAll hail. After taking over for an injured Nick Foles in Week 1 and putting together impressive performances, Gardner Minshew continued his rise in Week 3. The mustached living legend now has a 4:1 TD:INT ratio and has gone over 200 yards passing in every game he\u2019s played in. Oh, and that touchdown mark could be even higher, if his receivers would actually catch the ball. With all the quarterback injuries this season, you could do a lot worse than Minshew for a stream, especially in Superflex leagues.", "description": "We look ahead to Week 4 with some fantasy football pickups, led by the next man up in New England at wide receiver, Phillip Dorsett.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SVJxm7njVd5.pU7TwAzizQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j9sHQFTvYE2rQQ5Z_KQ9cg--~B/aD0yNjYwO3c9Mzk5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/40f801c0-dd78-11e9-ba7e-80efc2dcfc7f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
