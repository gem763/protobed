Exposed data included names, dates of birth, social security numbers, genders, phone numbers, email addresses, passports, and drivers' licenses.\n\nAfter a class-action lawsuit, Equifax agreed to pay victims of the data breach $125 each if they filed a claim. Victims could be eligible for compensation up to $20,000 for time spent remedying fraud, out-of-pocket losses due to the data breach, or 25% of the cost of Equifax products paid for one year in advance of the data breach announcement.\n\nRead more: Equifax is giving up to $125 to 147 million Americans \u2014 here's how to claim your money\n\nOver the weekend, Equifax sent an email to folks who filed a claim asking them to do two things:\n\n1.

Confirm that they wish to receive \"alternate compensation\" ($125) instead of free credit monitoring from Equifax.\n\nFrom the email, claimants are directed to Equifax's official settlement website, where they can input their claim number, give the name of their alternate credit monitoring service, and finally, indicate whether they would like to receive cash, at least four years of free credit monitoring, or nothing:\n\nEquifax/Business Insider\n\nThe same process can be completed through the mail. Claimants have until October 15, 2019 to verify or amend their claims. However, the email notes that the actual payout might be below $125 per claimant, due to the number of claims.\n\nEquifax did not respond to Business Insider's request for more information on the compensation.", "description": "Customers who filed a claim to redeem $125 from Equifax must verify or amend their claim before October 15 to be compensated.", "authors": ["Rebecca Aydin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d76707a2e22af7a413a9873-640-320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
