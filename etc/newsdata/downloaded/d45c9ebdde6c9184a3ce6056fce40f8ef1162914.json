David Gauke, a former Cabinet minister and outspoken critic of the Downing Street operation, said the rebellion had prompted \u201cmore engagement\u201d with Brussels. Alistair Burt, another ex-minister who spent the Conservative conference last week hammering the Johnson administration, said it \u201cwould be great\u201d to think the insurgency was one of the most successful in recent Conservative history.\n\nTheir joy comes despite the EU appearing to reject the Johnson proposals on arrival \u2014 with some suggesting the prime minister has put forward an unrealistic plan as a ploy that will allow him to blame the EU if negotiations break down \u2014 and despite Johnson sticking to his line that the U.K. is leaving on October 31.\n\n\"If a reasonable deal is reached, I will support it.\" \u2014 David Gauke, former Cabinet minister\n\nThe rebel MPs were instrumental in successfully pushing for parliament to back the Benn Act, which forces the prime minister to request a Brexit delay if he can't strike a deal with the EU by October 19 rather than take the U.K. out of the EU with no deal.\n\nThey were collectively crowned the most influential Londoners of 2019 by the Evening Standard newspaper at an awards ceremony on Thursday night (Tory chairman James Cleverly, who was at the event, made rude gestures when they picked up the gong).\n\nJohnson has repeatedly argued that the Benn Act \u2014 the \"Surrender Act,\" as he likes to call it \u2014 has made negotiations harder.\n\n\u201cIt has had the effect with our European friends of making them think maybe parliament can block this thing \u2014 maybe they will be forced to extend,\u201d he told Sky News in late September. \u201cIf you are in a negotiation that obviously makes it more difficult.\u201d\n\nPeace (for a time)\n\nDespite all the bad blood in the Tory ranks, things changed when Johnson sent his Brexit proposals to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon \u2014 resulting in an outbreak of unity between Downing Street and many of the Tory MPs who have been condemning his premiership.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Burt and Gauke welcomed the plan to impose a customs border in Ireland and a regulatory border down the Irish Sea, all underpinned by a vote of consent from the Northern Irish Assembly, while other Tory rebels \u2014 Steve Brine, Stephen Hammond and Greg Clark \u2014 all offered warm words for the plan.\n\nBurt told POLITICO he could vote for a deal along the lines of the proposals from Downing Street and insisted he believed Johnson was negotiating in good faith.\n\n\u201cAll I ever wanted to do was make sure we left with a deal and that nobody in the Conservative Party was under any illusion that leaving without a deal was a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf what we have done has helped propel that then I\u2019m very pleased because that is what we are determined to do.\u201d\n\nLetwin, who helped draw up the Benn Act, also said he could vote for a deal like the one put forward by Johnson if Brussels approves it.\n\nAsked whether the efforts of the rebels had paid off by forcing the prime minister back to the negotiating table, Letwin simply said: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nGauke said: \u201cIf a reasonable deal is reached, I will support it. Without the rebellion of 3rd September I think we would have left without a deal on 31st October so I am pleased there\u2019s now more engagement. But we\u2019ve a lot to get through in very little time.\u201d\n\nHe said the fight against no-deal could be far from over.\n\n\u201cI would want to support a deal if at all possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is helpful that the government has now set out its proposals but that is what they are \u2014 proposals. There\u2019s much work to be done to get a deal.\u201d\n\nDowning Street pushed back against the idea that the rebels had forced the prime minister to the negotiating table.\n\n\u201cThe PM has been clear since day one he would seek a new deal,\u201d an official said. \u201cThe PM is pleased the majority of his party trusted he would do just that. We want all MPs to support the proposals.\u201d\n\nRoute back in\n\nIf the rebels do support the proposals, it could be a way for them to re-take the Tory whip.\n\nParty chairman Cleverly told a fringe event at the Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference on Tuesday that \u201cthere should always be a path to a redemption.\u201d He added: \u201cI would love to see a route back but I think there does have to be a demonstration of loyalty.\u201d\n\nSome, including Burt, have already said they won't stand again at the next election, and on Friday Rory Stewart said he would instead stand as an independent to become mayor of London. Another rebel, Sam Gyimah, has joined the Liberal Democrats.\n\nBut the likes of Gauke, Brine and Clark have left open whether they intend to run at the next election. They will not be allowed to stand as a Tory MP without going through an appeals process.\n\nAnother one of the 21 rebels said they wouldn't back a deal just to get back into the party's good graces: \u201cMy support for a good deal won\u2019t be conditional on getting the whip back. If it\u2019s right for the country it\u2019s right for the country regardless of my personal status.\u201d\n\nOther members of the 21 are still refusing to play ball. Grieve said he would vote against any deal that came without a call for a second referendum.\n\n\u201cI would vote for a confirmatory referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy to see such a deal put to the public but only with a confirmatory referendum with the alternative option of remaining.\u201d\n\nOne former Cabinet minister, who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity, was hopeful that a deal would be the glue to bring all sides together, even the rebels.\n\n\u201cEveryone agrees that if [Johnson] does actually get a deal and get that deal through parliament then he becomes an all-purpose national hero \u2014 he has done something nobody else could manage,\u201d the minister said. \u201cAnd a part of that would be the reuniting of the Conservative Party.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson says they\u2019ve made things harder but rebels argue they forced PM\u2019s hand.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Thibault Larger"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1175866994-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
