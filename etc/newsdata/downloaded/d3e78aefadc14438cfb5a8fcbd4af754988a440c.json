Here come the Peronistas, again.", "language": "en", "text": "The ticket heavily favored to win this month has the corruption-tainted former president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, returning to the political stage as the vice-presidential candidate. A larger-than-life Peronista who ruled Argentina from 2007 to 2015, she towers over presidential candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, a former palace adviser and now her lesser-known running mate.\n\n\u201cYou could say that Cristina is the continuation of Evita,\u201d said Gonzalo Alderete Pag\u00e9s, the proprietor of Santa Evita. \u201cCristina is in our hearts, and we are sure of her return. Where non-Peronistas fail, she succeeds in opening her arms to the working class.\u201d\n\nIn Argentina, this is the season of the Peronista renaissance, built on a coalition of a disillusioned middle class, the left-leaning young and an increasingly angry poor. And as Sunday\u2019s election approaches, the battle lines being drawn here are over populism and corruption \u2014 the same toxic mix now touching off unrest across South America.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Argentina the Peronistas, opponents say, ran the nation into the ground during their last outing, when Kirchner is alleged to have falsified financial data, raided pension funds, doled out social handouts and solicited bribes even as she forged allegiances with allies such as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the father of Venezuela\u2019s socialist state. Though she enjoys immunity from incarceration as a sitting senator, the 66-year-old leftist has hit the campaign trail with nearly a dozen criminal cases against her.\n\nArgentines replaced her in 2015 with President Mauricio Macri, the scion of a real estate tycoon and a onetime darling of Wall Street who promised to drag the economy into the future. Like Moreno in Ecuador, Macri ripped cherished subsidies away from the people and sought the assistance of the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBut the fruits of Macri\u2019s labor are a failed economy that is now more moribund than the one he inherited. The cost may be his job. Should Macri lose Sunday, it would also prove a theory: that only the rough-and-tumble, union-backed Peronista machine can truly rule unruly Argentina.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n'We always go back'\n\nIn its early-20th-century heyday, Argentina, blessed with fertile plains that made it a global breadbasket, was richer than Japan and had more cars than France. But from the ashes of the Great Depression came not a rebirth but a long, slow decline marked by destructive military governments and the populism of Per\u00f3n.\n\nSince the 1940s, the center of gravity of the Peronista movement \u2014 officially, the Justicialist Party \u2014 has swung between the political right and left. Today, it encompasses schools of thought across the ideological spectrum, uniting politicians who share only a religious devotion to the nation and to Juan and Eva Per\u00f3n. So firm is the Peronista grip on the country that even Macri\u2019s surprise pick of a running mate \u2014 Miguel \u00c1ngel Pichetto, a 68-year-old, anti-immigrant senator \u2014 hails from the Justicialist center-right.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen we have a [government] that excludes Peronism, we always go back to Peronism,\u201d said Felipe Sol\u00e1, a veteran Peronista widely tipped to be foreign minister in a Fern\u00e1ndez-Kirchner administration. \u201cBecause that is [our] model of national survival.\u201d\n\nTo understand the Peronista surge, drive 1 \u00bd hours beyond the belle epoque buildings and Parisian-style balconies of elegant Buenos Aires to the low-income suburb of Jose C. Paz.\n\nHere, Sebastian Mart\u00ednez bit the hand that fed him.\n\nIn 2009, the 38-year-old heavy-machinery operator and his wife, Yanina S\u00e1nchez, personally received the keys to their new state-built house from then-President Kirchner. They also enjoyed subsidies on electricity and cooking gas granted to them under Kirchner\u2019s husband, former president N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who traded Argentina\u2019s top job with his wife before dying of a heart attack in 2010.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet Mart\u00ednez voted for Macri in 2015. For one, Kirchner wasn\u2019t on the ballot, having reached the limit of two consecutive terms.\n\n\u201cBut we also believed Macri, that he would change Argentina and create a better life,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cThat was a lie. All he did was help the rich and forget the poor.\u201d\n\nMacri\u2019s move to curb subsidies coupled with inflation, Mart\u00ednez said, has more than quadrupled the price he pays for electricity. At the same time, measures taken by Macri to restore faith in the economy \u2014 such as the IMF bailout \u2014 simply have not worked, while attempts to prop up the peso and improve government balance sheets have burned through reserves and brought a prolonged recession.\n\nAD\n\nIn the midst of the downturn, Mart\u00ednez lost his full-time job at a construction company, and is now putting food on the table for a family of five by bartering cleaning services at slaughterhouses for meat \u2014 that is, when he isn\u2019t collecting junk and cardboard on the streets to resell for subsistence cash.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat kind of life is this?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is what Macri has done to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know Cristina robs. But at least we were better off with her,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the restoration of Argentine democracy in 1983, three of the major economic crises the country has suffered \u2014 a brutal bout of hyperinflation in the late 1980s, a catastrophic debt default in the early 2000s and the current economic morass \u2014 have all occurred under non-Peronista governments.\n\nAD\n\nCritics say that\u2019s because the Peronistas set economic time bombs before they leave office \u2014 spending far more than the nation earns to boost their popularity and influence, while distorting the economy by printing cash.\n\nBut that, many here say, is a chronic problem hardly exclusive to Peronistas.\n\n\u201cIf I have to find a root for all the crises, it\u2019s that permanently, for the past 100 years, there has been a fiscal deficit,\u201d said Hern\u00e1n Lacunza, Argentina\u2019s treasury minister. \u201cThe state spent more than it collected. You can do that temporarily, but not permanently. And we did it for 10 decades.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNostalgia vote\n\nYet for nostalgia-prone Argentines, the feel-good days of Peronism are a strong draw \u2014 so strong that the Fern\u00e1ndez-Kirchner ticket scored a 16-percentage-point lead over Macri in the nation\u2019s all-parties primary in August, a result widely seen as predicting the election Sunday. If no candidate wins more than 45 percent of the vote, or at least 40 percent with a 10-point lead, the top two go to a runoff next month in which analysts say Macri might have a chance.\n\nAD\n\nKirchner, insiders here say, opted to take the vice-presidential slot for pragmatic reasons. She has a strong base estimated at between 25 percent and 35 percent. But her ceiling is low, in part because of her personal scandals. They include a daughter who is purportedly being treated in Cuba for medical problems but who critics say is actually avoiding prosecution at home in a corruption case linked to a safe-deposit box with $4.6 million in cash.\n\nAD\n\nThe calculation Kirchner made, analysts said, is that as vice president, she could bring her core voters to the table while allowing Fern\u00e1ndez to win the votes of those who intensely dislike her.\n\nViviana de Matteis, 55, owns a gym in Buenos Aires.
