Photo: Samir Hussein/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, delightful photos emerged of two of England\u2019s most powerful women sharing a jolly good laugh together: royal person Kate Middleton and the inimitable Mary Berry of Great British Baking Show fame.\n\nUpon seeing the endearing images, I immediately had two simple questions: Why were they together, and do they go way back? It didn\u2019t take long to retrieve answers. According to Vanity Fair, Mary joined the duchess on a delightful tractor ride earlier today in Surrey, where Kate was unveiling her new \u201cBack to Nature\u201d garden. Also, while the two aren\u2019t close friends, this isn\u2019t their first introduction \u2014 that came in 2013, when Kate admitted to the TV personality that she\u2019s a \u201cbig fan\u201d during a visit to a charity they both support.\n\nOnce resolving those two questions, I was then able to focus on one much more fascinating: What in bloody hell were these two fancy ladies talking about that caused them to erupt in laughter?\n\nHere are a few potential subjects I considered:\n\n\u2022 #BinGate\n\n\u2022 The sexy-lady hedge in Sheffield that drunk lads keep trying to bone\n\n\u2022 Mary\u2019s first music festival at the sprightly age of 84\n\n\u2022 Spotted dick, jam roly-poly, or truly any other British dessert with a deranged name\n\n\u2022 Photos of Kate\u2019s supremely cool baby\n\n\u2022 Prince Charles\u2019s tampon-related phone sex\n\n\u2022 The time the Daily Mail tried to peddle an absurd theory about Kate Middleton\u2019s fingers\n\nAfter much speculation, though, I\u2019ve come to believe there\u2019s only one possible answer: Paul Hollywood\u2019s unrivaled Instagram.\n\nStay in touch.
