I could go on, but I\u2019d rather say something about what happened a few days later.\n\n\n\n9/11/2001 was a Tuesday, and by the week\u2019s end I was in Montreal, having traveled there by train. The hotel was close by McGill University, and my room overlooked its football stadium. An Alouettes\u2019 game was about to kickoff, and I was startled when the announcer asked the crowd to join in singing \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d It was a big crowd, and not only did they sing, they stood to do so. Every verse.\n\n\n\nTears well up as I write this now; in the hotel that day, I wept.\n\nPeople tend to underestimate what even small gestures can mean to the grieving. But this wasn\u2019t small, nor merely a gesture. Nearly two decades hence, I still can\u2019t express how precious it was, and is, to me.\n\nIt went like that for the week I was there. Virtually every time someone asked where I was from, no sooner were the words \u201cNew York City\u201d out of my mouth than the convention of such occasions instantly fell away. Invariably, the person would look into my eyes and, with palpable sincerity, offer a version of \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d Often a hand would reach out in an instinctive contact of compassion.\n\n\n\nIn those moments, with words unable to pass the knot in my throat, I could do little more than nod with gratitude.\n\n\n\nAll too quickly, we \u201crecovered\u201d from the grief that, like a balm, softened and soothed our common coarseness, and today we\u2019re more fractious and inflamed than on 9/11 Eve.\n\n\n\n\u201cProud to be an American\u201d has long-seemed a poor way to put what is true for me \u2013 and hopefully most: I am grateful to be an American, and one born and raised in New York City to boot.These days I live in Canada \u2013 another fact I report not with pride, but thanksgiving.\n\nMore than a few Canadians of my acquaintance like talking smack about their Southern Cousin. I prefer to view it as a kind of sport. And yet, I fear that, over time, it could become a habit. And a habit, once ingrained, can be hard to break. Can, in fact, become a hardness in itself.\n\n\n\nOn this anniversary, I mourn an obscenity that\u2019s proved an ominous turning point. I remember also a candle \u2013 burning bright on the altar of my heart \u2013 and the Canadians whose kindness lit it.\n\nTim Kelleher, former New Media Editor for First Things, wrote and directed that journal's first film, \"The Creed: What Christians Profess, and Why It Ought to Matter\"", "description": "I was in New York that day, watching the Towers from my Brooklyn apartment.
