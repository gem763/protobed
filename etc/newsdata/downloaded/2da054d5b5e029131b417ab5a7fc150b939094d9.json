There was no midwife involved. They all did that themselves.\n\n\u2018A daughter had a birthday on the same day as my daughter. They often played together. But only in their back garden. The children never went out on the street or came to our house. You\u2019d often see them climbing in the trees.\n\n\u2018The children didn\u2019t go to a school in the neighborhood. But I saw them leave every morning with a bag with their father, so I assumed they were going to school somewhere else.\u2019\n\nBrunner only lived in the street for a very short time and Sandra said she assumed he knew the van Dorsten family \u2013 who she described as reclusive \u2013 because shortly after moving in they removed a fence that separated their back gardens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe children\u2019s mother died in mysterious circumstances in 2004 \u2013 but by this time Brunner had already moved out, Sandra said.\n\nShe added: \u2018One day Geert came and told me that his wife had just died of colon cancer. Nobody knew she was that sick. No one knew when she was buried.\n\n\u2018Not long after, the family had left but they continued to pay the rent for the house. One of the daughters lived in the house for a while. I think she was sixteen. But a short time later when someone from the housing association came round, the house was vacated.\u2019\n\nThe father was said to have a shared passion for woodwork with his alleged captor, and used to make toys, while Brunner built wooden canoes.\n\nOne of Jan\u2019s posts on Facebook \u2013 which he began using again in June after nine years of silence online (Picture: Facebook)\n\nJan told a local Ruinerwold barman he wanted to end the way he and his siblings were living (Picture: Facebook)\n\nSandra said: \u2018I was surprised that they had remained in contact and even more shocked when I heard what had happened to Geert and his family.\n\n\u2018Josef was never friendly. He never said hello. He wasn\u2019t friends with anybody.\n\n\u2018He never had a wife. He never had a girlfriend. He would never go to a bar. He was just mysterious.\n\n\u2018When they left, I didn\u2019t know where they\u2019d gone.\n\n\u2018It was a total surprise to me that they were still in touch with Josef. This is a very sad situation for the family.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has now emerged that Geert and the family owned a toy shop in the village in Zwartsluis to the west of Hasselt whey the family lived for a short period before moving to the farmhouse in Ruinerwold.\n\nThe house has now been sealed off by police as investigations continue.\n\nPolice said that the father and five children are all receiving medical treatment.\n\nChris Westerbeek, owner of the caf\u00e9 De Kastelein, said eldest son Jan drank five pints before telling him how he had not been outside in nine years and wanted to end the way he and his siblings were living.\n\nIn the months before raising the alarm, Jan had posted sporadically on social media accounts, beginning in June this year.\n\nOn his public profile on Facebook it shows he used the platform for several years until 2010, when he posted saying that he had moved to Ruinerwold.\n\nHe no longer posted on the site until June when he announced he was working as an online store manager at Creconat, located in Meppel, around four miles away.\n\nJan posted pictures of himself \u2018in nature\u2019 to his social media accounts (Picture: Jan Zon van Dorsten/Instagram)\n\nPolice have now sealed off the house and surrounding area (Picture: Alamy)\n\nAccording to De Telegraaf, Creconat is associated with a timber company called Native Creative Economy, also based in Meppel, which is owned by Brunner.\n\nCaf\u00e9 owner Chris \u2013 who called police \u2013 told Dutch broadcaster RTV Drenthe Jan had been in three times before but on his last visit told him he could not go home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018You could see he had no idea where he was or what he was doing. He said he had run away and that he urgently needed help.\u2019\n\nNeighbours of the remote farm, which was set back 200 yards from the nearest road, told RTV Drenthe that Brunner was a private man who never allowed visitors inside the house.\n\nPictures show it was surrounded by trees and a perimeter fence.\n\nThe neighbours said they had been suspicious as he would go back and forth from the house to his workshop 15 miles away in a Volvo every day without speaking to anyone.\n\nHe would make weekly visits to a local Lidl supermarket where it is believed he would stock up on supplies for the family.\n\nA man who owns a building business next door said: \u2018I have known him for about seven years, but I really know very little about him.\n\n\u2018I would see him every day, but he will just say hello. I could never have imagined that he had another home and six people were in there. He never ever talked about friends or anybody.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018I was curious because he would buy something like 50 toilet rolls and huge boxes of food once a week and then drive off with them.\u2019\n\nInvestigators admit they are deeply puzzled by the case and are still working to answer key questions.\n\nOfficers have had difficulty understanding the victims as some of their speech was \u2018incomprehensible\u2019.\n\nInitially it was thought the family lived off the land and animals but reports now suggest their alleged captor brought them food from Lidl (Picture: Alamy)\n\nThe father and his five adult children are now receiving medical treatment (Picture: Alamy)\n\nPolice said a number of questions remain unanswered (Picture: ANP)\n\nIt is understood they slept and ate on the floor in a \u2018small, enclosed space\u2019 with no natural light.\n\nPolice said the family were not malnourished and looked \u2018normal\u2019.\n\nLocal mayor Roger de Groot told reporters on Tuesday: \u2018I understand there are a lot of questions. We have many too.\n\n\u2018The police are investigating all possible scenarios.\u2019\n\nBrunner, who has gained the nickname \u2018Josef the Austrian\u2019 locally, will appear in court today.\n\nHe has been charged with deprivation of liberty and prejudicing the health of others.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
