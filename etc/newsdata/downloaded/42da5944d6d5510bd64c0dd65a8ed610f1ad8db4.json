But experts question if the new strategy is realistic, or even legal.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said Friday that US troops were reinforcing their positions, including with mechanized forces, in Deir Ezzor in northern Syria.\n\nTheir mission will be to prevent the Islamic State group from gaining access to oil fields and securing \u201cresources that may allow them to strike within the region, to strike Europe, to strike the United States,\u201d Esper told reporters on a visit to Brussels.\n\nTrump on October 6 said that some 1,000 US troops were leaving northeast Syria where they had kept an uneasy peace between neighboring Turkey and Kurdish fighters, who had lost thousands as they led the Western-backed operation that crushed the Islamic State group.\n\nTrump vowed to get the United States out of \u201cendless\u201d wars \u2014 with Russia filling the void \u2014 and said that US troops were not there to protect the Kurdish fighters, whom Turkey links to separatists at home.\n\nBut Trump said Wednesday that a \u201csmall number\u201d of US troops would stay to secure the oil.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep the oil, and we\u2019ll work something out with the Kurds,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 who withdrew from a border area after a Turkish offensive made possible by Trump\u2019s pullout \u2014 still control the Deir Ezzor oil fields east of the Euphrates River near the Iraqi border.\n\nBut in guarding the oil, the United States has sharply changed its rationale for why it remains in Syria against the will of President Bashar al-Assad, who has largely won a brutal eight-year civil war.\n\n\u201cThis move would be a radical shift from the United States\u2019 longstanding focus on defeating ISIS\u2019s territorial caliphate and preventing ISIS from re-emerging in Syria and it would instead signal that the Trump team has a larger, geopolitical objective in Syria,\u201d said Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nThe United States would effectively be holding Syria\u2019s oil resources hostage as it pushes Assad and his Russian backers to accept US ideas for a post-war settlement, he said.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s mission in Syria is morphing from a noble battle against the most reviled terrorist organization in the world into a quixotic gambit to force changes in Assad\u2019s behavior by taking Syria\u2019s oil,\u201d Heras said.\n\n\u2013 Dubious legality \u2013\n\nTrump, who has mused in the past that the United States should have seized Iraq\u2019s oil after the 2003 invasion, said Monday that Washington wanted to keep Syria\u2019s fields.\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBrett McGurk, the US envoy who built the coalition to fight the Islamic State group until he resigned in protest in December, said that seizing Syrian oil would be illegal.\n\n\u201cLike it or not but it\u2019s owned by the Syrian SYP,\u201d McGurk said, referring to the state-owned Syrian Petroleum Company.\n\nThe former diplomat said that the United States had discussed with Russia the idea of exploiting the oil and putting proceeds into a trust to be used for post-war reconstruction.\n\n\u201cThe Russians were not really hopping into that, I think they would be even less so now,\u201d he told a conference.\n\nAn estimated 200 US troops are deployed with the Syrian Democratic Forces in Deir Ezzor.\n\nBut the number could prove insufficient if Russia tries to seize the zone, as it attempted in early 2018.\n\nSome 200 pro-Russian mercenaries were believed to have been killed in a coalition strike as the fighters tried to seize a post of the Syrian Democratic Forces where US troops were present.\n\nThis time around, the operation could end quite differently. Abandoned by the United States, the Kurdish fighters have allied with Moscow.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 After abruptly pulling US troops who protected Kurdish fighters, President Donald Trump has identified protecting oil as the new", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/4e14d4_kurdish-fighters-custody-an-alleged-islamic-state-group-fighter-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
