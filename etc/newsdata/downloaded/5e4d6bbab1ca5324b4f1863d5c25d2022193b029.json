Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney\n\nNatalie Portman has explained her notable absence from Thor: Ragnarok, in the lead-up to her return to the Marvel franchise as a female Thor.\n\nThe actor plays scientist Jane Foster, in the 2011 Thor and the 2013 Thor: The Dark World, the two first instalments in the franchise dedicated to the God of thunder.\n\nShe is, however, absent from Thor: Ragnarok, the third chapter, which stars Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston among others.\n\nWhile fans have wondered why Portman (and her character Foster) were left out of Ragnarok, Portman says it simply wouldn\u2019t have made sense for her to be included.\n\n\u201cObviously, I wasn\u2019t written into [Thor: Ragnarok] because of where it took place,\u201d she told ET. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really on Earth, and my character is on Earth.\u201d\n\nUnlike Thor and Loki, Hemsworth and Hiddleston\u2019s characters, Foster is a human who comes from Planet Earth.\n\nThor and Loki, on the other hand, are gods who come from Asgard, another realm altogether. They do spend some time on Earth in Ragnarok, but Foster isn\u2019t involved.\n\nHer absence is acknowledged when a fan tells Thor in the film she\u2019s \u201csorry Jane dumped [him]\u201d, to which Thor replies by unconvincingly assuring her it was a \u201cmutual dumping\u201d.\n\nPortman is now preparing to return to the Marvel franchise as Thor, following an announcement in July at San Diego Comic Con.\n\nShe will appear as the superhero in Thor: Love and Thunder, a movie that\u2019s being directed by Taika Waititi and is slated to be released in November 2021.", "description": "Natalie Portman has explained her notable absence from Thor: Ragnarok, in the lead-up to her return to the Marvel franchise as a female Thor.The actor plays scientist Jane Foster, in the 2011 Thor and the 2013 Thor: The Dark World, the two first instalments in the franchise dedicated to the God of thunder", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mence Michallon"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s.iBnhnQdHEkFsGf0kcezA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/ab8421663795ae20dcb2088de614b5bb", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
