Cimino II, who confirmed the death, said Mr. Tosches (pronounced TOSH-ez) had been ailing but did not cite a precise cause.\n\nIn \u201cDino,\u201d his best-selling 1992 biography of Martin, Mr. Tosches described the famed actor, singer and comedian as a menefreghista, Italian for someone with a couldn\u2019t-care-less attitude. The term just as easily applied to Mr. Tosches, a swaggering tavern-owner\u2019s son who donned silk homburgs, sprinkled his prose with profanity and Homeric metaphors, and espoused the earthy pleasures of French wine, fine opium and fried pork chops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Tosches likened writing to prostitution; was banished from Rolling Stone magazine after he and colleague Richard Meltzer prankishly filed stories under each other\u2019s bylines; railed against his publisher in a 2002 novel, \u201cIn the Hand of Dante\u201d; and once fabricated the date of his own death in biographical materials, selecting 2021, the 700th anniversary of Dante\u2019s passing.\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ginger Baker, Cokie Roberts, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Ginger Baker, the prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental rock drummer who helped form Cream, rock-and-roll\u2019s first supergroup, and inspired awe and imitation in a generation of drummers, died Oct. 6 at 80. Read the obituary (Mj Kim/AP)\n\nHe often cited the Italian poet as an influence, alongside Hesiod, William Faulkner and Thomas Mann \u2014 even as he began his career in what was then considered a literary backwater, penning rock criticism in the late 1960s and \u201970s for Creem, Rolling Stone and Fusion magazines.\n\nMr. Tosches was credited with helping to elevate rock journalism and was dubbed one of the \u201cNoise Boys,\u201d a group of bold and idiosyncratic writers that included Meltzer and Lester Bangs. \u201cThey were all partisans of rock at its noisiest \u2014 culture as ecstatic disruption,\u201d fellow critic Robert Christgau wrote in the Village Voice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Tosches often seemed less interested in analytical criticism than in broader commentary. He said he sometimes reviewed records without tearing off the shrink wrap and fabricated the release of albums as a hook to riff off his latest idea.\n\n\u201cI never took the whole thing that seriously,\u201d he told the New York Times in 1992. \u201cWhat I was doing, I don\u2019t know if it would be considered criticism or even journalism. I was just using it as a rubric to get away with things in print, things that probably would be impossible to get away with now.\u201d\n\nPerhaps his most infamous early piece was a Rolling Stone review of Black Sabbath\u2019s 1970 album \u201cParanoid,\u201d which began with an imaginative description of satanic sex rituals involving \u201cShadaic numinae,\u201d \u201cthe mirrored sign of Ariael\u201d and a hookah bowl filled \u201cwith black opium tars and a dash of Asthmador powders.\u201d The review concluded with Mr. Tosches seeming to confuse Black Sabbath with a rival band, Black Widow.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to reviewing new releases and bluntly interviewing artists such as Patti Smith and Muddy Waters (\u201cDo you like getting drunk?\u201d), Mr. Tosches bestowed late recognition on forgotten and underappreciated performers. His first book, \u201cCountry\u201d (1977), profiled musicians including yodeler Cliff Carlisle and emerged out of Mr. Tosches\u2019s conviction that country music had been \u201cdamned, ignored and dismissed\u201d by most critics.\n\nHe later wrote a companion volume, \u201cUnsung Heroes of Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u201d (1984), spotlighting Big Joe Turner and Wynonie Harris, among many others. In Mr. Tosches\u2019s telling, the story of rock was \u201cone of greed and innocence, tastelessness and brilliance, the ridiculous and the sublime,\u201d all coming together to create \u201ca funhouse-mirror reflection of the American dream gone gaga.\u201d\n\nHis interest in questions of wealth, fame and desire went on to inform his work as a novelist and biographer, beginning with \u201cHellfire,\u201d his 1982 book on Lewis. The singer-songwriter and pianist was known as much for his hell-raising style as for tracks such as \u201cWhole Lotta Shakin\u2019 Goin\u2019 On\u201d; Mr. Tosches opened his biography with a scene in which Lewis tried to ram his Lincoln Continental through the gates of Elvis\u2019s Graceland mansion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice soon arrived to arrest Lewis, who \u201cgrinned and shook his head,\u201d Mr. Tosches wrote, \u201cfor he knew that the cold, brilliant handcuffs would not long contain him.\u201d In a later sequence, Mr. Tosches quoted Lewis as saying he was \u201cglad\u201d when Elvis died: \u201cJust another one out of the way. I mean, Elvis this, Elvis that. What . . . did Elvis do except take dope that I couldn\u2019t git a hold of?\u201d\n\nIn 2006, Britain\u2019s Observer newspaper named \u201cHellfire\u201d the greatest music book ever written. \u201cJerry Lee was, to me, like a figure out of the Old Testament, out of William Faulkner,\u201d Mr. Tosches told the newspaper. The book ended with Lee still alive and essentially contemplating eternity, he said, but \u201cit\u2019s the way we all live. Shallow life, shallow ditch. Big life, big abyss.\u201d\n\nMr. Tosches was born in Newark on Oct. 23, 1949. A grandfather came to the United States from the Italian region of Abruzzo , where Mr. Tosches later traced Martin\u2019s ancestry, and his father worked as a bouncer at a burlesque house before running a bar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe things I wanted to be when I was a kid were an archaeologist, because of dinosaur bones; a garbage man, because they got to ride on the side of the trucks; and a writer,\u201d he told the Times in 1992. \u201cIf I had become a garbage man, I could have retired by now.\u201d\n\nInstead, he began writing what he described as \u201creams of garbage,\u201d publishing his first story when he was 19 and also crafting poetry, collecting many of his later pieces in the book \u201cChaldea and I Dig Girls.\u201d To support himself, he worked in the early 1970s as a snake hunter for the Miami Serpentarium, pouring gasoline down rattlesnake holes. Around that same time, he also took a job as a paste-up artist at the Lovable Underwear Co.\n\n\u201cI had a glue pot, some strips of type, and heart-shaped stickers for pantyhose that said, \u2018No bag, no sag,\u2019 \u201d he told the Times. \u201cOne day, I think it was January 1972, I got drunk at lunch and I figured, Well, I\u2019ve been calling myself a writer, let me see if I can do it. I never went back to work after lunch.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Tosches went on to combine investigative reporting with flamboyant, first-person writing for magazines including Esquire, Playboy, GQ and Vanity Fair, where he was a contributing editor and once chronicled his quest to visit an opium den.\n\n\u201cNick has the ability to get completely loose and seem to be saying whatever pops into his mind \u2014 to say things that are scabrous, outrageous, confusing \u2014 and at the same time do this in a stylistic framework of absolute eloquence and really pristine form,\u201d music journalist Greil Marcus told the Boston Globe in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a wild heart beating in this late-19th-century dandy.\u201d\n\nMr. Tosches\u2019s first novel, \u201cCut Numbers\u201d (1988), was about crime, a recurring subject of his biographies. In addition to \u201cDino,\u201d which was slated for several years to become a film directed by Martin Scorsese, he wrote \u201cPower on Earth\u201d (1986), about Italian financier and felon Michele Sindona; \u201cWhere Dead Voices Gather\u201d (2001), about minstrel singer Emmett Miller; and \u201cKing of the Jews\u201d (2005), on New York mobster Arnold Rothstein.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also wrote \u201cThe Devil and Sonny Liston\u201d (2000), in which he suggested that the former heavyweight boxing champion had thrown his two title bouts against Muhammad Ali because he was controlled by the mob. \u201cMr. Tosches is an exhaustive reporter,\u201d wrote New York Times reviewer Christopher Lehmann-Haupt. \u201cHe seems to have dug up everyone ever connected to Liston and got them to talk, particularly about the network of mob connections.\u201d\n\nComplete information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nWhile Mr. Tosches pored over documents and conducted dozens of interviews for his nonfiction books, he said he never wanted to write as a \u201cjust the facts\u201d journalist and sought to impart a kind of beauty and wisdom that he found more often in fiction. \u201cThere are times when I try to write beautifully, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m trying to exorcise my own demons,\u201d he told Esquire in 2012. \u201cIf I am, there are other ones lurking beneath, because they keep coming out. Maybe little by little I\u2019m fumigating.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He wrote stylish, unrestrained biographies of Jerry Lee Lewis, Dean Martin and Sonny Liston.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-yxMwl7tqFEEJvLtK4mV0G2-8s0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HIEW4SHULUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
