Plantains change color as they ripen: They are firm when green and unripe, then soften as they turn yellow, and eventually, black. Like bananas, plantains develop more sugar as time passes. The more sugar a plantain has, the more caramelization you will get when you cook it. For the sweetest maduros, use blackened plantains. If you can only find yellow plantains at the store, buy them in advance and be prepared to wait over a week for them to fully ripen. They\u2019re worth the wait.", "description": "Tender in the middle and crisp at the edges, maduros are fried plantains that are served as a side dish throughout the Caribbean and Latin America Plantains change color as they ripen: They are firm when green and unripe, then soften as they turn yellow, and eventually, black Like bananas, plantains develop more sugar as time passes", "authors": ["Kiera Wright-Ruiz", "Lidey Heuck", "Colu Henry", "Sam Sifton", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Claire Saffitz", "Julia Moskin", "Robert Simonson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/dining/kwr-maduros/kwr-maduros-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
