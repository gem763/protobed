Reuters\n\nGlobal Times, a tabloid affiliated to Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, quoted naval observer Li Jie as saying that the Type 001A was likely to be undertaking its eighth sea trial after solving problems discovered in the previous trials.\n\nIn August the Type 001A identified technical problems that required immediate attention during its seventh trial, a fairly common occurrence in the processes.\n\nZhou Chenming, a Beijing based military expert, said that the Type 001A's commissioning had already been postponed and the major problem now was a lack of shipborne aircraft and problems with the flight control system.\n\nZhou said the control system worked with J-15 fighters, which will be the primary jets used on the ship, but \"is not yet compatible with other aircraft, which hinders the aircraft carrier's final commissioning\".\n\nOnce commissioned, the ship will join the country's first carrier, the Liaoning, at sea, boosting the country's naval capacity.\n\nChina's first domestically developed aircraft carrier, the Type 001A, in port at Dalian. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nCollin Koh, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies from Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said: \"With two aircraft carriers, the PLA Navy will have greater chances to hone its carrier capabilities \u2013 conducting more missions, training, and all of these contributing to the accumulation of expertise and know-how.\n\n\"This means qualitatively improving [its] carrier capability, including human capital.\"\n\n\"For long-term strategic significance, it means an expanding power projection capability of the PLAN that allows it to promote presence in regions where Beijing asserts national interests.\"\n\nThe Type 001A's trial phase has taken longer than some military observers had expected. The aircraft carrier set out for its first sea trial in May 2018, some 17 months ago. By comparison, the Liaoning, a former Soviet Kuznetsov-class vessel, underwent 10 sea trials over a 13-month period before it was commissioned.\n\nThe Type 001A is a modified version of the design that features upgraded radar and bridge systems and will carry 36 J-15s compared with the Liaoning's capacity of 24.\n\nThe ship also features a ski-jump deck for take-offs, has a displacement of 70,000 tonnes and will be able to carry a total of 40 aircraft.", "description": "The Type 001A aircraft carrier features upgraded radar and bridge systems and will carry 36 J-15 fighters compared to the 24 of China's other carrier.", "authors": ["Kristin Huang", "South China Morning Post"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9ff904af90972d23ab329?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
