They added that high levels of temporary workers in August were perhaps to be expected, given that it's the summer holiday, and students (many of whom don't work during their studies) are squeezing in some work experience.\n\nComing in the middle of a huge media campaign to promote buying locally, rather than relying on US products, others said they would rather buy a Huawei phone anyway.", "description": "Apple denies claims that staff experience poor working conditions in the Foxconn factory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15370/production/_108669868_gettyimages-1172890780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
