At just $700 for the phone plus screen case bundle(for a limited time), that\u2019s over a thousand bucks cheaper than the $1,980 Galaxy Fold, let alone the circa $2,400 Huawei Mate X.\n\nOkay, sure, this isn\u2019t the same seamless experience you\u2019d get on the phones with bendy displays, but it\u2019s not like that is necessarily a huge loss either. While being able to view images and photos in one big panel is nice, for many, the folding form factor is all about getting more work done on a mobile device.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely why the Surface Neo and Duo feature two separate screens rather than one (well, that and durability). Having a second display makes multitasking much easier, and as a bonus, you can turn off the panel if you\u2019re not using it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like LG is skimping much on specs to achieve the low price either. The device packs a Snapdragon 855, a 128GB SSD, 6GB of RAM, and a 4,000 mAh battery. That\u2019s better specs than the Pixel 4 \u2013 and that one doesn\u2019t include an entire second display.\n\nBetter yet, you can get it for cheaper via a carrier. In the US, you can buy the phone for about $300 upfront and monthly installments; it\u2019ll be available from AT&T November 1 and from Sprint November 8 The G8X may not be as futuristic as the alternatives, but it can provide many of the same benefits while being a lot easier on the wallet.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSnag_18dc141.png&signature=eb5b92a4e0637f64a41f9954acd173c3", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
