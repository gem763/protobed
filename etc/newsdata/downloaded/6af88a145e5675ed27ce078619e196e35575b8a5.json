Consequently, the excess of protein will probably end up in urine or faeces, which is not harmful for pets, as long as they are healthy.\n\n\"However, feeding pets an excessive quantity of proteins may become an environmental issue, given the amount of excreted nitrogen that comes from the protein metabolism.\"\n\nPURINA uses animal based raw materials or animal by-products (such as chicken, beef, lamb) in its balanced pet foods.\n\nJenifer continued: \"Animal by-products are sometimes thought to be low quality ingredients that shouldn\u2019t be included in pet foods - but this simply isn't the case.\n\n\"To be permitted in pet food they must come from animals deemed for human consumption and slaughtered under veterinary supervision. Once not intended for human consumption it becomes an animal by-product.\n\n\"The pet food industry uses surplus products from the human food chain and Purina purchases all by-products from approved suppliers.\"\n\n\u201cAnimal by-products are a good source of protein, essential fatty acids, iron and some B group vitamins; so not only are they great for your pet, they are also enjoyed by them.\u201d", "description": "PURINA expert explains why feeding an excess amount of protein to a pet provides them no health benefit", "authors": ["Dave Masters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20385272.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_11Outside_Large.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
