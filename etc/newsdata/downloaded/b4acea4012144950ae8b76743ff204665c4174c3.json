The footage from the scene showed people carrying Spanish national flags and giving Nazi salutes.\n\nWARNING: DISTURBING IMAGES\n\nSpanish ultranationalists clash with Antifa activists in #Barcelona amid protests for Catalan Independence pic.twitter.com/piXlxdse8J \u2014 RT (@RT_com) October 18, 2019\n\nAs night fell, some of the sites of the clashes resembled a war zone, with burning barricades, rubble everywhere and clouds of thick white smoke in the air.\n\nViolent episodes may attract media attention, but they\u2019re just a small part of the picture, Toni Casserras from the Catalan \u2018Free People\u2019 party told RT. The majority of the pro-independence activists believe in peaceful civil disobedience and they will keep going out into the streets.\n\n\u201cThe protests [in Catalonia] are being sustained for several years and \u2013 despite the violence, which is applied to the protesters; despite imprisoning our leaders \u2013 people don\u2019t give up. Protests are efficient, especially, massive protests.\u201d\n\nThe general strike kicked off in Catalonia\u2019s capital early on Friday, with small businesses not opening and employees of bigger firms and factories skipping work. The walkout caused the cancellation of almost 60 flights at Barcelona-El Prat Airport as well as the disruption of train operations in some parts of the region. Many more flights were canceled in Barcelona in previous days as the demonstrators made the airport completely inaccessible.\n\nRoad traffic was also affected as the protesters blocked roads and highways by setting tires on fire and leaving nails on the asphalt.\n\nThe AP-7 highway was cut off near the French border, paralyzing the crossing between Spain and France. In Girona, farmers drove their tractors across the central streets to the cheers of crowds to show Madrid that they mean business.\n\nThe large groups of people who marched from various parts of Catalonia started arriving in Barcelona at around noon Friday and brought the city to a standstill. They had set out on their journey to the regional capital from Girona, Tarragona, Vic, Martorell and others cities by foot on Wednesday.\n\nStudents staged minor protests throughout Barcelona in anticipation of the major rally, which started at around 5pm local time. A group of pro-independence activists also camped outside the entrance to the iconic Sagrada Familia basilica in the heart of Barcelona, preventing tourists from coming in.\n\nREAD MORE: Barcelona\u2019s Sagrada Familia cathedral shut down by Catalan \u2018Picnic for the Republic\u2019 protesters (PHOTOS, VIDEO)\n\nBarcelona has been in turmoil since Monday when Spain\u2019s Supreme Court sentenced nine politicians and activists to up to 13 years behind bars for organizing the referendum on Catalonia\u2019s independence in 2017. The plebiscite, which saw the majority of the population voting for secession from Spain, was labeled illegal by Madrid and met with a harsh police crackdown that left hundreds of people injured.\n\nAs for the latest protests, Thursday was the most violent day of the rallies in Barcelona as the demonstrators built barricades, burnt bonfires and clashed with police. Dozens were hurt on both sides.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
