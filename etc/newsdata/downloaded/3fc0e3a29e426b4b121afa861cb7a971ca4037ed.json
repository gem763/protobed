But we need to continue like that and keep our nerve'.\n\n\"We knew we would have another chance and we did it. It's a massive, massive win.\"\n\nLovren added that he was happy with how his side performed overall, saying: \"I'm happy for Hendo, he deserved that. And, especially for the three points, Sadio - it was a great run from him [to win the penalty].\n\n\"Overall, we're quite happy. Let's just now recover well, sleep well and eat well because we have a game every three days. So, just be calm with our heads and everything will be okay.\"\n\nLiverpool welcome Arsenal to Anfield on Wednesday for a League Cup Round of 16 clash.\n\nKick-off is at 21:30 (SA time).\n\n- TeamTalk Media", "description": "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp delivered a strange half-time team talk on Sunday, telling his players he was \"satisfied\" to be trailing 1-0 against Tottenham.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7990/5d48e2d810a144a2865e3a2dbba6e56e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
