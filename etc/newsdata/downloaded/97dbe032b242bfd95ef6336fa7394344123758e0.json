Prosecutors say he pursued her on the taxpayer dime.", "language": "en", "text": "On the week of her 23rd birthday, the sheriff took Nabors with him on a business trip to Charlotte. On the first night, Lewis poured her a drink in her hotel room, only for Nabors to wake up hours later to Lewis on top of her, raping her, she would later testify in court. On the second night, Lewis came to Nabors\u2019s room to apologize, and begged to stay the night, she alleged. She woke up to him sexually assaulting her again, she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t call 9-1-1. He was \u20189-1-1,'\u201d she wrote, in the since-deleted post. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell anyone higher up, because he was the top.\u201d\n\nBut Nabors would not need to call 911 anymore. As her blog post spread, it caught the attention of state investigators \u2014 and now, more than two years since the alleged assaults, Lewis is off to prison.\n\nOn Monday, Lewis was booked into the Kirkland Correctional Institution to serve one year in prison after being convicted last week of misconduct of a public officer. Lewis, 43, was accused of using taxpayer money to pursue an extramarital affair with Nabors, his personal assistant, before allegedly sexually assaulting her at the hotel in Charlotte. Lewis, who claimed the sex was consensual, is not charged with sexual assault.\n\nAD\n\nBut Nabors testified for hours in court last week about how Lewis violated her, how he spent months manipulating her into remaining his closest \u201cfriend\u201d so she would keep quiet about the incident, and ultimately how he began stalking her as she tried to push him away.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the courtroom Friday after Lewis was sentenced, Nabors said testifying \u201cwas one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want victims to think that it\u2019s easy, or that you\u2019re going to be rectified after all this. It will never be right,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he did will never be right. I can\u2019t get back what he stole from me, but we can move forward.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLewis\u2019s attorney, Rauch Wise, is appealing his conviction, saying the indictment was \u201coverly broad,\u201d WSPA reported. Speaking to reporters after the trial, Wise said, \u201cHe had an affair. I still am having trouble seeing how that affair cost the sheriff\u2019s department any money. The jury saw it another way, but ... it\u2019s a very vague statute, and exactly what he had to do to violate is almost in the eye of the beholder.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLewis hired Nabors as his assistant after he was elected sheriff in 2016. Nabors testified that the position seemed alluring at first. Lewis paid her $62,000 \u2014 more than some officers with two decades of experience, prosecutors said \u2014 and gave her a government-issued vehicle, a new phone and laptop. He required her to accompany him everywhere: meetings, lunches, crime scenes in the middle of the night. She took notes, answering his emails and taking his phone calls.\n\n\u201cI thought it was going to be the best job ever,\u201d she testified.\n\nAD\n\nBut the sexual harassment started almost immediately after Lewis was sworn in January 2017, she said. It started with the unwanted compliments. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a really cute figure,\u201d he allegedly told her in one example, according to a lawsuit Nabors filed. It allegedly escalated after Nabors confided in Lewis that she and her husband were going through a separation.\n\nAD\n\nWithin a matter of days, he had arranged a taxpayer-funded weekend getaway to Charlotte to hold a budget meeting. It\u2019s unclear why this meeting couldn\u2019t take place at the sheriff\u2019s office in Greenville County.\n\nProsecutors insist it\u2019s because Lewis planned to have sex with his young assistant at the hotel.\n\nAD\n\nLewis and Nabors drove to the hotel together March 7 to meet their colleagues, she testified, and when they arrived, he slipped a bottle of whiskey into her bag, saying he would get it from her later.\n\nThat night, alone in the elevator after a night of drinking \u201cpaid for by the people of Greenville,\u201d prosecutors said, Lewis asked if he could come retrieve the bottle. Once in her room, he poured the two of them a drink.\n\nConversation quickly became inappropriate, Nabors testified, as Lewis began lamenting the lack of intimacy in his marriage. He sat down next to her on the couch and put his arm around her, then tried to kiss her, she said. \u201cI got up and said, \u2018This is not a good idea,\u2019\" Nabors recalled \u2014 but before long \u201cthings started to get fuzzy for me,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe remembers him lying on the bed and taking off his shirt.\n\nThe next thing she remembers, she testified, it was 5 a.m. \u201cI remember waking up with him on top of me,\u201d she said.\n\nNabors said she was confused. That morning, she blamed herself, believing perhaps she just drank too much. \u201cI just tried to put myself back together and figure out what I did wrong, and what had happened in the room,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the next night, she was sexually assaulted again, she said.\n\nWalking back from her 23rd birthday celebration with colleagues, Nabors said she and Lewis ended up alone, and he pulled a bottle of sexual lubricant out of his pocket, which he denies. He allegedly asked, \u201cWhose room, mine or yours?\u201d She said neither. But Lewis persisted, asking if they could please just talk things out. She ultimately retreated to her room alone, but awoke at 3:55 a.m. to a knock on the door and a text message from Lewis. It said only, \u201cMe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said he wanted to apologize. At the time, Nabors thought he meant it.\n\n\u201cI felt bad for him. I felt like he had really thought he messed up and he was sorry. And he didn\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d and so she allowed him to stay with her \u2014 as long as he promised not to touch her.\n\nShe woke up later to Lewis digitally penetrating her, she said.\n\nDuring his testimony, Lewis claimed that nothing was ever done without Nabors\u2019s consent and that she was never unconscious. He admitted to having sex with her the first night, but did not acknowledge any additional incident the second night, claiming to not even remember sending the \u201cMe\u201d text message.\n\nKevin Brackett, the prosecutor, told jurors that the differing versions were beside the point, given that Lewis still pursued sex with Nabors on the county dime, the basis of the charges. He told jurors that since prosecutors did not charge Lewis with sexual assault, they did not need to decide whether the sex was consensual.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t use public money to try to have sex with employees. You just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Brackett said. \u201cSurely, this is common sense. Everybody seems to understand it but Will.\u201d\n\nNabors said she returned to work and tried to push forward despite feeling uncomfortable. But in the ensuing months, Lewis appeared to be tracking her movements and following her, while demanding that she not date other men, Nabors said. She started recording phone calls and private conversations. On multiple occasions, he is captured telling her he would trade his entire command staff for her, that he would like to just \u201croll around\u201d with her and drink \u201con company time,\u201d and appears to threaten to limit her job responsibilities if she doesn\u2019t join him on a taxpayer-funded trip to Reno \u2014 which Brackett suggested meant sex.\n\nIn a manipulative attempt to get her to stay with him on the trip, Lewis said, \u201cI can get two plane tickets but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll pay for two rooms.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSavanah punched record on her phone and you get to hear for yourself what he intended,\u201d Brackett said. \u201cYou get to hear the naked, brazen corruption and selfishness and manipulation, every nasty stinking wretched thing that this pathetic man did. You don\u2019t have to guess, because it\u2019s all here.\u201d\n\nThe trip never happened. Ultimately, Nabors quit her job at the end of April 2017, less than two months after the alleged assaults, after attempting to report her sexual assault to a female superior and getting nowhere, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to her lawsuit, which Nabors dismissed last year after a nearly $200,000 settlement, Nabors hit a breaking point in May 2017 and walked into a mental health clinic to seek help.", "description": "I couldn\u2019t call 9-1-1.
