One NFL owner thinks the ratings can go even higher due to sports gambling, and that could be big money for the league and its sponsors.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nDespite seeing a slight drop in the ratings two years ago, the NFL remains a juggernaut that dominates the ratings. Last year, NFL games bounced back from their dip and were up five percent with an average of 15.8 million viewers. Three of the four most-watched series last year were NFL content, only bested by HBO\u2019s finale for \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones thinks these ratings can go even higher. Calling the television numbers \u201cthe best I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d the outspoken Jones sees the rise of legalized sports betting as a sure bet for the NFL to see ratings climb more.\n\n\u201cThe viewership is where our numbers will increase. People will stay longer. That value is how our sport will benefit from gaming,\u201d Jones told Yahoo! Finance on Thursday. \u201cI dare say that gaming will increase the value of television, of presenting our games, I dare say it will go up 50 percent because of the gaming concentration.\u201d\n\nThe logic certainly makes sense, but Jones\u2019 estimates might be a bit too optimistic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowth of viewership by 50 percent would be astronomical, far eclipsing any other live programming on television. Former president of CBS Sports and current media consultant Neil Pilson thinks there is room for the NFL\u2019s ratings to grow but disagrees with where Jones thinks those numbers will end up.\n\n\u201cI think we all agree that gambling will help interest in NFL football and quite probably the television ratings,\u201d Pilson told FOX Business. \u201cBut Jerry\u2019s estimate of a 50 percent increase in ratings is all Jerry Jones. I think there will be an increase but I don\u2019t think it will be anywhere near the proportions that Jerry is suggesting. But again, that\u2019s Jerry.\u201d\n\nRatings for the NFL's 100th season opener --- Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears --- were up 14% from last year, when the Atlanta Falcons and Philadelphia Eagles played.\n\nThe hope, though, is that legalized sports gambling and gaming will be a hook for more fans to consume live NFL content.\n\nThe hook of a wager on a game will get fans to tune in more often and through the end of the game. With so many prop bets that go beyond the winner and the loser and delve into the minutiae of individual performances, the theory is that more fans will flock to their television sets to watch the outcome.\n\nIndividual player performances are a driving force now, replacing point spreads and winners/losers for many viewers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAs Jones alludes to, the growing hook for the consumption of NFL games is increasingly becoming less about fandom and outcome. Wagering has always been a draw for watching professional sports and the growing fantasy football market has drawn in a larger and more diverse viewership in recent years.\n\nThere is certainly something to the argument that viewership is being driven by factors outside of rooting interests. Attendance for NFL games was down last year to its lowest average since 2011. This might be from the interest of fans to consume multiple games at the same time rather than be stuck in the stadium.\n\nIt has often been argued that football is a sport best consumed on television and not live within the context of a stadium. With legalized sports gaming and fantasy football both seeing meteoric growth, it appears that these trends will only continue.", "description": "With the spread of legalized sports gambling, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones thinks NFL ratings are set to soar.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/jerry-jones-reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
