REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nWhile a new drainage system has headed off immediate danger, the experience of places like Lenk has brought the consequences of climate change home to voters ahead of a parliamentary election on Sunday.\n\nPolls show gains for the environmentalist Greens, vaulting them into the mix for a seat in the grand coalition that has governed the conservative nation for decades. Changing just one member of the seven-seat council would be a political sensation.\n\n\u201cThere is a deep and durable change in people\u2019s concerns and a new general awareness of the urgency,\u201d said Pascal Sciarini, a political scientist at the University of Geneva.\n\n\u201cThe expected progress of the Greens and Green Liberals (GLP) can clearly be explained by the environmental concerns linked to climate change.\u201d\n\nA Sotomo poll this month for broadcaster SRF showed the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party (SVP), which won record seats in 2015 amid Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, will dip 2.1 points to 27.3% while the Green Party\u2019s share will rise more than 3 points to 10.7% of the vote.\n\nThe smaller, more centrist Green Liberal Party (GLP) is also expected to advance, bringing their combined strength to a theoretical 18%.\n\nThat would place them collectively third behind the SVP and the centre-left Socialists (SP), ahead of the centre-right Liberals (FDP), who have two of the seats on the Federal Council that is Switzerland\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cIf the elections turn out as the current state of affairs suggests, we\u2019ll have to discuss the \u2018magic formula\u2019,\u201d GLP President Juerg Grossen told the SonntagsZeitung paper this month.\n\nHe was suggesting a shake-up of the cabinet whose seats have been divvied up among the SVP, SP, FDP and Christian People\u2019s Party (CVP) in nearly the same way since 1959.\n\nIn December, the two parliamentary chambers will elect the government, but in the past it has taken more than one national election cycle for that parliamentary selection procedure to change the cabinet lineup to more closely reflect the results.\n\nEven if the Greens do not get a seat, they could help push through legislation such as a carbon law rejected by parliament last year that is again under consideration.\n\nPROTEST MARCHES\n\nIn part due to the country\u2019s distance from the sea, Swiss temperatures are rising at twice the global average. Damage to infrastructure, for example by rockfalls, and lost energy revenues linked to climate change could cost up to 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.01 billion) a year, a government study this year found.\n\nA Sotomo survey showed 27% of voters viewed climate change as their top concern, followed by health insurance premiums and ties to the European Union.\n\nTens of thousands, mostly students, have marched to demand climate action even though big protests are rare. Switzerland\u2019s direct democracy system makes referendums the normal channel for venting opposition to the status quo.\n\nYet, it is unclear whether action in the street can convert into votes. Swiss Election Study data show that fewer than a third of 18 to 24-year-olds took part in 2015. National turnout was only 49 percent.\n\nClimate strike organizer Marie-Claire Graf, 23, was urging peers to vote.\n\n\u201cYoung people are starting to consider voting itself, like being a vegan or biking, as a climate-friendly action,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Greens\u2019 success could hit all major parties, including the SVP, whose President Albert Rosti has called climate change a \u201ceco-socialist scam against the middle class\u201d.\n\nBut analysts caution against expecting too radical a shift. Green parties do not have a monopoly on ecological issues and many voters in the rural SVP heartland are loyal.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard in polls that the \u2018green wave\u2019 is coming,\u201d Lenk mayor Rene Mueller said. \u201cI think the people of Lenk, in general those in the mountains, won\u2019t be so influenced by this.\u201d\n\nPolls close at midday (1000 GMT), with initial projections, including from the many postal votes, due soon thereafter.\n\n($1 = 0.9872 Swiss francs)", "description": "Perched nearly 2,000 meters above the Swiss ski village of Lenk, a lake has emerged as the Plaine Morte glacier melts.
