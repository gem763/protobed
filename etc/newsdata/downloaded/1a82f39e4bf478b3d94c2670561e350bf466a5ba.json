If you\u2019re not an Amazon Prime member already, Amazon\u2019s terms and conditions say that you\u2019ll have to pay the non-Prime price of $9.99 for Amazon Music Unlimited, making the total price $10.98.\n\nYou\u2019ll save a lot on a Dot\n\nWhichever deal you go with, a third-gen Echo Dot costs $49.99 on its own, so you\u2019ll be saving a lot on a pretty good smart speaker either way. However, if you\u2019re looking at the new Echo Dot with clock, that still costs $59.99.\n\nAmazon says that the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription will auto-renew after one month. If you want the speaker but don\u2019t want the service, it seems like you could buy the Echo Dot with this deal, cancel Amazon Music Unlimited before your month is up, and still keep the device. We haven\u2019t tested this ourselves, though.\n\nAlso note that this deal doesn\u2019t give you access to Amazon\u2019s lossless streaming tier, Amazon Music HD. That costs $12.99 if you\u2019re a Prime customer and $14.99 if you\u2019re not. Theoretically, you could buy an Echo Dot on this deal and upgrade to Amazon Music HD the month after.\n\nEarlier this week, Spotify began offering a free Google Home Mini with a Spotify Premium subscription for a limited time. So if you\u2019ve been looking for deals on smart speakers, you\u2019ve got a couple of great ones to pick from right now.", "description": "If you want an Echo Dot, Amazon\u2019s got a new deal you can use to get one for cheap: the company will sell you a third-gen Echo Dot for just 99 cents if you buy a month of Amazon Music Unlimited along with it.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-CN5TN5X_iE6XFDSgLw0ZAtKroE=/105x216:1812x1110/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13255999/dseifert_181011_3006_1133_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
