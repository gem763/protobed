On the thousandth day of his presidency, Donald Trump met with Democrats and had what the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called a \u201cmeltdown\u201d. \u201cWhich, is it even really a meltdown any more?\u201d Kimmel asked. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t have a meltdown \u2013 he had a Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe White House claims Trump was measured, factual and decisive, not hysterical,\u201d Kimmel continued, pointing to one of the president\u2019s bizarre tweets from the day: a picture of Pelosi standing at a table full of men, captioned: \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe really should be writing headlines for the Enquirer instead of running the country,\u201d said Kimmel.\n\nThe meeting with Pelosi was ostensibly to discuss the Turkish invasion of northern Syria, a military strike against America\u2019s Kurdish allies facilitated by the president when, over his military advisers\u2019 objections, he removed US troops from the region.\n\nJimmy Kimmel on Democratic debate: candidates 'angrily agree with each other for hours' Read more\n\n\u201cTrump now is stuck because basically he gave the president of Turkey a green light to kill these people we promised to protect,\u201d Kimmel summarized. Republicans are even upset, with some demanding he reverse the decision, \u201cwhich he can\u2019t, because that would mean admitting he was wrong, which he doesn\u2019t do\u201d.\n\nIn an attempt at damage control, the White House on Wednesday released a letter written by Trump to Trukey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what this was supposed to prove other than he\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Kimmel, quoting the first line: \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s work out a good deal!\u2019 As if he\u2019s running a Honda dealership or something.\u201d\n\nTrump sent the letter on 9 October, right before Erdo\u011fan proceeded to cross the Syrian border, \u201cso it was insane and ineffective, which is the art of the deal\u201d, said Kimmel.\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah poked at the hypocrisy of the Trump family\u2019s criticism of nepotism, especially in the case of Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look that a Ukrainian company hired Hunter Biden just months after Joe Biden became the Obama administration\u2019s pointman on Ukraine, because it looks very much like he got this business because of his father\u2019s position,\u201d Noah began. \u201cAnd I understand why a lot of people would complain about that. What I don\u2019t understand is why these people are complaining about that.\u201d\n\nThese people would be Trump\u2019s sons Donald Jr and Eric, who have put Hunter Biden on blast at rallies and on Fox News, saying they had to give up overseas business for their father\u2019s candidacy. \u201cDo you see me on any boards?\u201d Eric Trump asked Fox News.\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Hold up, so the Trump boys wanted to attack the Bidens and the issue they chose was nepotism??? pic.twitter.com/2fP8i68HyI\n\n\u201cOK, first of all, I\u2019m not surprised nobody has put Beavis and Forehead on any corporate boards,\u201d Noah responded. \u201cSecondly, if there was ever an example of people who got opportunities because of their names, it\u2019s these two.\u201d For example, Donald Trump Jr was recently paid $50,000 to give a speech at a college. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s son, why else would they be asking him to speak?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cTo share his expertise on bad beards?\u201d\n\nBesides, the Trump children have continued to build their businesses overseas in places such as India, Indonesia, Uruguay and the Philippines. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Amazing Race with no running and no chins,\u201d joked Noah.\n\nStill, at least Trump\u2019s sons are one step removed from the presidency, said Noah, \u201cbecause there are other Trump children who are in business and government\u201d. That would be his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who work in the White House while maintaining overseas business interests; a dozen Ivanka Trump products just received copyright approval by the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cOK, come on, China approved a dozen trademarks for Ivanka right as her dad was negotiating trade deals with China? You can\u2019t tell me that\u2019s not suspicious timing,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI mean that\u2019s like how right before Christmas, my mom said that a horrible accident happened at Santa\u2019s factory. How does this happen every year, Mom?\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Noah concluded, \u201cI\u2019m not defending Hunter Biden. I don\u2019t know him, I don\u2019t know about his business. All I\u2019m saying is that the last people who should be talking about the blurred lines of family names and political influence are the people who are currently running their home office from the White House.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Late-night hosts respond to Trump\u2019s letter to Turkey\u2019s president and his tweet on Nancy Pelosi", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b50470deeadb25d775d74ff312af87f2dcfc52f/137_0_1635_981/master/1635.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=875c5baf0b65390401a96b91924c6764", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
