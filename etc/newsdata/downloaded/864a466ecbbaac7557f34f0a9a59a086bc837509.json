Video footage does show him at one point lying on his back, appearing like he is trying to regain his senses, and then getting up.\n\nPolice also said they probably wouldn't charge the man because he didn't enter her home, Wolfe-Clarke told CBS13.\n\nThe mom, who claims she has a gun at home for protection, estimated the man prowled around her property for two hours.\n\nAfter leaving the camera's view, the man returns naked and dripping wet, the video footage (above) shows\n\n'He was soaking wet and naked, and it was so disturbing,' Wolfe-Clarke says, convinced the intruder had used her hot tub for as long as 30 minutes\n\nWolfe-Clarke and her daughter Makena (above) show the backyard hot tub where the skinny-dipping intruder enjoyed his late-night swim\n\n'Who knows what he would have done because if he's feeling comfortable enough to get naked in the backyard, to jump into somebody else's fence and climb over, there's something, in my opinion, that's seriously wrong. And I think that something else could have happened,' Wolfe-Clark told FOX40.\n\nShe said she believes the man, who wore glasses, a light blue shirt, dark shorts and sneakers, had jumped her fence to gain access to her backyard. He left his glasses behind upon leaving, Wolfe-Clarke wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe mom, who lives in the home with her daughter, said police admitted that even if they were able to locate the intruder, they likely couldn't charge him since he didn't steal anything or cause harm to anyone.\n\nThe mother wasn't taking any chances, she said, and was beefing up security at her home to protect her and her daughter.\n\nShe also made the video public on Facebook in the hopes that someone will know who the naked, skinny-dipper is.\n\n'I really, really am hoping that somebody will see this video and see who it is. And just to know that he's not going to do that again to anybody else, that's my biggest concern because the feeling is unsettling,' Wolfe-Clark told FOX40.\n\nEven if the intruder is not arrested, Wolfe-Clark says she hopes he is still identified and put on public display for his actions.\n\n'I think best case scenario, he's identified and shamed,' she told CBS13. 'So shameful for what he did.'", "description": "A prowler was caught on surveillance camera footage naked and dripping wet after he went skinny dipping in a backyard hot tub, as a mom and daughter were asleep inside the property.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
