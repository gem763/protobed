It took courage, \u201cand not just political courage \u2013 people in Texas have a lot of guns\u201d.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang talked about his father, an immigrant who \u201cgrew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor, and now his son is running for president\u201d \u2013 a comment that prompted Colbert to launch a faux auction called the \u201chumble background games\u201d. \u201cCan anyone here tonight beat no floor, peanut farm?\u201d Colbert said. \u201cThe bidding starts at slept in a bucket behind a cockfight.\u201d\n\nAfter three hours soundbites, carefully crafted background stories, Biden gaffes, Colbert had to ask: \u201cWhat did we get? Ten candidates, four moderators, three hours, two languages and hopefully one person who can beat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah reacted to many of the same moments from Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate. \u201cBernie with a diminished voice is just not the same, man,\u201d said Noah on Sanders\u2019s uncleared throat. \u201cIt\u2019s like Luke Skywalker but with a butter knife.\u201d\n\nMost of the candidates seemed to be on the same page with gun reform. O\u2019Rourke, whose home town faced a deadly mass shooting just a month ago, came out particularly strong with a promise to require assault weapon buy-backs. The promise was \u201ca ballsy statement\u201d, said Noah. \u201cAnd he said it with such confidence as well \u2013 which is not the way I\u2019d talk about taking away assault rifles from people who like to shoot.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) At the third round of 2020 Democratic debates in Houston, the moderators play hardball, Andrew Yang plays Oprah, and Castro comes after Biden. pic.twitter.com/hKgbclbJ1E\n\nOn immigration, the candidates discussed how they plan to undo Trump\u2019s policies \u2013 a platform Noah described as \u201cno more kids in cages, increased legal immigration, give everyone free ladders to climb over the wall\u201d.\n\nBiden was asked point-blank if he thought Obama\u2019s immigration policies, under which 3 million people were deported, were a mistake. \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,\u201d Biden replied. When the moderator countered \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Biden shifted responsibility with: \u201cI\u2019m the vice-president of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was not a good look for Biden,\u201d Noah commented, \u201cbecause this always happens, right? When Obama\u2019s being praised, Biden jumps into the picture with him, but then when Obama\u2019s being criticized Biden\u2019s like, look man, I was the vice-president \u2013 I didn\u2019t do shit.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nThe Democratic debate featured 10 candidates, \u201call of whom tried to stand out and avoid being eliminated under extreme time pressure in a televised event that was in no way at all like a gameshow,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, because, as he noted: \u201cThis is democracy \u2013 it\u2019s very serious. Now let\u2019s put 45 seconds on the clock and go.\u201d\n\nFor starters, \u201cBernie made a strong argument tonight for giving every American access to affordable throat lozenges,\u201d joked Kimmel, who likened Sanders\u2019s scratchy tirades against American healthcare spending to keeping \u201chis turn signal on for an hour and a half\u201d.\n\nKimmel then turned to Yang, who promised to give his \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d of $1,000 a month for a year to 10 random families who signed up on his website. \u201cThat might be the most ridiculous proposal I\u2019ve ever seen on this network, and I\u2019ve watched every episode of The Bachelorette,\u201d Kimmel said.\n\nAll in all, Kimmel concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t know who \u2018won\u2019 the debate, but watching candidates discuss the issues using real facts \u2013 I\u2019ve forgotten what it was like. It was like walking out of North Korea and into a Costco.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts sort through three hours of sound bites and campaign promises from the Democratic presidential debate", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f0f9f20fca82d393fa75793306f0e50f392749c/68_0_1565_939/master/1565.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7102940043091c1bc72dd390e69874f", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
