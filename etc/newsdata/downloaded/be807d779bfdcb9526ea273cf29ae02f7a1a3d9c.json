PhRMA argued on Thursday that reducing its companies\u2019 profits would reduce the incentive for investors to take a risk by investing in drug companies, whose new treatments often fail somewhere along the line in development.\n\n\u201cWe rely on capital investment to develop our R&D to produce new medicines,\u201d said Lori Reilly, chief operating officer for PhRMA. \u201cIf you do diminish the return element, or the profitability element of that, you take away the incentive for many investors to put money in here, because there's lots of places you can invest in, lots of places that carry a lot less risk.\u201d\n\nSens.
