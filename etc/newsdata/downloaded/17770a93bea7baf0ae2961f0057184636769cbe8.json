But earlier this year, Vice President Mike Pence announced the administration's plan to accelerate that timeline by four years.\n\nNasa unveils new spacesuit for next Moon landing\n\nNasa's giant 'Moon rocket' takes shape\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Blue Origin unveiled the Blue Moon lander concept in May this year\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not good enough,\" Mr Pence said about the original schedule when announcing the 2024 target in March.\n\nThe programme has been named Artemis, after the sister of Apollo.\n\nBlue Origin, a relatively new entrant in the human spaceflight sector, will lead the team, which is composed of companies with decades of experience building hardware for Nasa.\n\n\"We recognise that this project and the time frame that the nation is calling for is ambitious, very ambitious,\" Brent Sherwood, Blue Origin's vice president of advanced development programs was reported as saying by the Washington Post.\n\nUnder existing plans, the lander would undock from a small space station in lunar orbit called Gateway. Nasa has previously said it wants a lander that's split into three separate parts, or stages.\n\nOne stage is called the transfer vehicle or \"tug\". It carries the other two elements down from Gateway to a lower lunar orbit. Northrop Grumman would build this stage under the national team bid.\n\nTo the Moon and Beyond\n\nImage copyright ESA\n\nCan America get back to the lunar surface by 2024?

Blue Origin plans to build this part of the lander, which will incorporate the company's BE-7 engine that is currently being developed.\n\nFinally, an ascent element blasts the astronauts back into lunar orbit. Lockheed Martin would develop this vehicle.\n\nBoston-based Draper will provide descent guidance and flight avionics (electronics systems).\n\nThe national team bid will be in competition with other companies for the contracts to build the landing system. The winning bid could be announced in the coming months.\n\nMr Bezos was speaking at the International Astronautical Congress in Washington DC.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "description": "Four aerospace firms will team up in a bid to build a lunar landing system.", "authors": ["Paul Rincon", "Science Editor", "Bbc News Website"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ADCC/production/_109329444_mediaitem109329443.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
