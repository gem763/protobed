The Open is a five-week online workout competition in which users submit videos of workouts selected by CrossFit.\n\nThe closest male competition to Fraser, 29, was fellow American Noah Ohlsen (19 per cent), who shot up to second place, stealing the lead from Fraser in dramatic fashion during the 2019 CrossFit Games, which were held in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nNicholas Rizzo, a fitness research director with RunRepeat who conducted the survey, said Fraser has a couple of competitors to watch out for concerning the Open.\n\n\u201cThere seem to be only two real contenders to compete with Fraser,\u201d Rizzo said. The first is Ohlsen and the second is Iceland\u2019s Bjorgvin Karl Gudmundsson.\n\n\u201cGudmundsson finished right behind Noah Ohlsen at the most recent games in third place and managed to take second place at the last Open. Thirty-three per cent of the experts surveyed see him as a major competitor to fight for second place. But the real question is, are either of these two going to be dethroning Fraser?\u201d\n\nFraser has won the Games the past four years in a row, and the Open the past three seasons. If he wins the Games again in 2020 he will pass Rich Froning for most consecutive titles. Froning retired from individual competitions back in 2014 and has since gone on to win the team portion of the competition four times with Mayhem Freedom.\n\nOne of the surprise picks in the survey was Hong Kong\u2019s own Ant Haynes, who competed under the Chinese banner at the 2019 CrossFit Games as the nation\u2019s country representative (Hong Kong and Taiwan were designated as China under CrossFit\u2019s rules). He got 6 per cent of the vote to win the Open.\n\nHaynes came 27th at the Games and has been consistently improving his Open score every years. Having placed 561st, 266th, and 123rd respectively over the previous three Opens. \u201cSome experts are expecting this to be a big year for Haynes\u201d Rizzo added.\n\nWhen it comes to the women, Australia\u2019s Tia-Clair Toomey, 26, who has yet to win the Open but has won the last three editions of the Games, is pegged to add some hardware to her award stand. Toomey garnered 44 per cent of the votes, followed by Sara Sigmundsdottir, who many think is yet to reach her full potential.\n\n\u201cIceland\u2019s number one competitor, Sigmundsdottir, is the only one with real potential to make an upset,\u201d said Rizzo citing the results of the survey. \u201cSince Sigmundsdottir\u2019s explosion on to the scene and podium finishes from 2015 to 2017, she has struggled to regain her dominance. With setbacks and injuries plaguing her in 2018 and disappointment from her 20th place finish in the 2019 Games, she may be coming into the CrossFit Open with something to prove.\u201d\n\nThere will be two CrossFit Sanctionals held in China this season. The first will be the Pandaland CrossFit Challenge (December 7-8) in Chengdu, and the second will be the second iteration of the Asia CrossFit Championship from May 8-10 in Shanghai. There will be a total of 28 Sanctionals in 21 different countries.", "description": "Experts are polled in a survey and the reigning CrossFit champions from 2019 come out on top to little surprise", "authors": ["Patrick Blennerhassett"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/07/504033da-e815-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293e_image_hires_171902.JPG?itok=QdVqBV1-&v=1570439948", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
