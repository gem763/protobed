So how might the numbers stack up for Mr Johnson? The BBC's political research unit has got its calculator out.\n\nHow many votes does he need?\n\nThere are 650 seats in total in the House of Commons. The Speaker, who presides over the House of Commons and decides who gets to speak, and three deputy speakers, do not, by convention, vote.\n\nSeven Sinn Fein MPs do not vote either as they choose not to take their seats on political grounds.\n\nAssuming every other MP votes, then Boris Johnson needs 320 votes to give his deal a majority.\n\nIf any MP decides not to vote or \"abstains\" - then the number needed for a majority would come down.\n\nWho could vote for it?\n\nNot these parties: the Scottish National Party (SNP), Liberal Democrats, the Independent Group for Change, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party. They have all said they will vote against the deal.\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said its 10 MPs will all vote against the deal but the government is still trying to persuade them otherwise.\n\nThe other groups that Mr Johnson needs to sway are:\n\nLabour MPs who might rebel against the party line\n\nThe European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative Brexiteers\n\nConservative MPs expelled from the party in September, most of whom backed Theresa May's deal\n\nWhile Labour also plans to tell its MPs to vote against the deal, the BBC is aware of 12 Labour MPs who say they are planning to, or are very likely to, defy party orders and back Mr Johnson's deal.\n\nThere are another 12 who are currently undecided - mostly MPs in Leave-voting constituencies who want a deal but aren't impressed by the deal on the table. We'd probably expect most of these to vote against although we can't be certain.\n\nThen there are the Independents. It seems likely that most of the 21 former Conservatives who were kicked out of the party (or in parliamentary language had \"the whip withdrawn\") are likely to back the deal - but some are expected to vote against and a handful are undecided.\n\nA number of them are also expected to back the Letwin amendment which would withhold approval of the deal, until the legislation to enact it was safely passed (a move that would trigger the \"Benn Act\" and force the prime minister to request a further postponement of Brexit until 31 January).\n\nThere could also be some support from ex-Labour independents. For independent MPs we think there could be five undecided.\n\nAmong current Conservative MPs, Boris Johnson has won over 15 of the ERG who previously rejected Theresa May's deal three times.\n\nThere are another ten Conservative MPs (mostly ERG too) who are undecided. We'd probably expect most of these to back the deal although, again, we can't be certain.\n\nAll of that gives 310 MPs currently planning to vote for the deal and 302 currently planning to vote against.\n\nThat leaves 27 MPs who are undecided, or unwilling to say anything.", "description": "The deal agreed by Boris Johnson and the EU can't proceed until it has been voted for by MPs.", "authors": ["Peter Barnes", "Senior Elections", "Political Analyst", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13BB4/production/_108602808_mp_vote_index_976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
