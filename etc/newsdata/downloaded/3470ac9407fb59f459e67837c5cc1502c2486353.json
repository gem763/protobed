They were about the Political Declaration and our future relationship with the EU after Brexit.\n\n\"Having reviewed what has been agreed, it is clear that the Johnson deal is a far worse deal than Theresa May's deal. It paves the way for a decade of deregulation. It gives Johnson licence to slash workers' rights, environmental standards and consumer protections.\"\n\nHe added: \" Labour will not support a flawed Brexit deal that harms jobs, rights and living standards. This deal will unquestionably do that.\n\n\"Labour cannot support this deal. If Boris Johnson has confidence in his deal, he should put it back to the people in a public vote against remain - and that is an argument we will be making on Saturday.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nMr Johnson struck the last minute Brexit deal just three hours before 27 EU leaders met to decide if it should pass.\n\nThe PM jetted to Brussels early yesterday morning announcing a breakthrough following days of missed deadlines, chaos and counter-claim.\n\nThe Prime Minister finally agreed a deal after speaking to EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker by phone and chatting to a handful of Cabinet ministers.\n\nMr Johnson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable, fair outcome and reflects the large amount of work that\u2019s been undertaken by both sides.\n\n\u201cFor us in the UK it means that we can deliver a real Brexit that achieves our objectives and it means the UK leaves whole and entire on October 31.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nJean-Claude Juncker added he was happy about the deal - even if sad about Brexit. He said: \u201cWe have a deal and this deal means that there is no need for any kind of prolongation.\n\n\u201cThis is a fair a balanced agreement. It provides certainty where Brexit creates uncertainty.\u201d\n\nEU leaders unanimously signed off the deal at a political level rather than a full legally binding one as they need more time to trawl through the 500-page text.\n\nThe 64-page draft would keep a transition period continuing EU rules and payments to December 2020.\n\nIt scraps the hated Irish backstop with one UK official describing it as \u201cfinito\u201d.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe final draft deal today put forward a more complex system involving special rules on customs.\n\nLabour slammed the plans - with shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer issuing stark warnings about the political declaration for the future relationship with the EU.\n\n\u201cIt paves the way for a decade of deregulation.
