He was wearing the stolen jersey under his jacket and posed in the jersey for his jail mugshot.\n\nAccording to the Foxboro Police, Cineus pleaded not guilty to a larceny charge at his arraignment in Wrentham District Court.\n\nThe Brady jersey was valued around $10,000, per the Attleboro Sun Chronicle, which reported a blue glove as another stolen item.\n\nBrady's jersey has been stolen before. In 2017, his game-worn Super Bowl jersey was stolen from the team's locker room after the Patriots' overtime win against the Atlanta Falcons. The FBI investigated and later solved the crime.\n\nMessages left by USA TODAY Sports with the Patriots organization were not immediately returned Friday.\n\nCineus\u2019 lawyer, Bill Galvin, did not immediately return calls from USA TODAY Sports.", "description": "An arrest has been made after a man took a Tom Brady jersey from the Patriots' Hall of Fame on Thursday.
