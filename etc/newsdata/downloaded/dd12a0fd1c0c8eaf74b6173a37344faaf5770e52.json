He later became a series regular on Grown-ish.\n\nCole told UPI in a recent interview that despite his busy special with the TV shows and movie projects, he doesn\u2019t plan to stop doing stand-up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what got me to everything else,\u201d Cole said of his stand-up career. \u201cThat\u2019s my sanctuary, that\u2019s where I feel comfortable. It\u2019s therapeutic, as well. It\u2019s a way for me to get off the stuff that\u2019s on my chest.\u201d\n\nCole\u2019s comedy tackles a broad range of subjects, from the lack of \u201cB batteries\u201d to the unique struggles involved with being black in the current political climate. He said he doesn\u2019t see any subject as too controversial to be discussed on stage.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s going in. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Cole said, adding that even a \u201ctouchy topic\u201d can make it into his set if he finds a way \u201cto go around\u201d the controversy and keep it funny.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that I would never not talk about, but I would do it in a classy way,\u201d he said.\n\nCole said he often finds himself toning down the material that he writes to avoid raising controversy.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these days, you have to,\u201d he said.\n\nThe comedian said that, ideally, freedom of speech and the freedom to be true to \u201cwho you are\u201d would win the day, but performers have to walk a careful line to avoid being subjected to censorship and boycotts.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t understand the mentality that leads to backlash against comedians for the jokes they tell.\n\n\u201cWhy do you have to go start a campaign, get me fired from the people who do love me, and now they can\u2019t see me because of something you couldn\u2019t handle?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense. Just don\u2019t watch it. If you don\u2019t want to watch the Playboy channel, don\u2019t subscribe to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe things you like, I probably don\u2019t like, but I\u2019m not about to go write a letter about it. It\u2019s just not for me. So unfortunately, we have to watch out for this [politically correct] era we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nCole\u2019s role as Charlie Telphy on Black-ish began as a friend and coworker of Andre Johnson (Anthony Anderson), and segued into Grown-ish as the character became a part-time professor at the college attended by Zoey Johnson (Yara Shahidi). He\u2019s now a series regular on both shows.\n\nCole said fans can expect Charlie to remain \u201cas odd, weird and quirky as possible\u201d in the current sixth season of Black-ish, which premiered in September.\n\nThe comedian said he enjoys the \u201cover-the-top\u201d aspects of the role, but he doesn\u2019t see much of his own personality in the character.\n\n\u201cI like how you learn something about him every time you see him, which is great,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I have a little bit of that in me. But not overall. I\u2019m nothing like that guy.\u201d\n\nBlack-ish is known for taking on a wide variety of complicated social issues, and Cole said he trusts in the writers to handle those topics delicately.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always different social issues that we can tackle, I\u2019ll leave that up to the writers. But I would love to touch on just how PC everybody is nowadays. That would be a great episode,\u201d he said.\n\nCole said he doesn\u2019t feel worn out by pulling double-duty as a regular on two shows, in addition to his stand-up schedule and appearances in several upcoming movies.\n\n\u201cI remember the times when I had nothing to do. So anytime I feel tired, I feel like complaining, I think of that, and I go: \u2018Remember, you had nothing to do.\u2019 So I get up, do what I gotta do,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that when he has enough of a break in his schedule, there\u2019s one thing he would like to add to his resume: directing.\n\n\u201cI would love to direct,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, I could probably direct an episode of Grown-ish, but I have to show them that I\u2019m serious and put in the work and the time. Once I get to that moment where I can go, \u2018OK, let\u2019s focus, let\u2019s get this going,\u2019 then I will.\u201d\n\nDeon Cole: Cole Hearted streams Tuesday on Netflix.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Comedian Deon Cole\u2019s latest stand-up special, Cole Hearted, hits Netflix on Tuesday, and the long-time comedian and star of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
