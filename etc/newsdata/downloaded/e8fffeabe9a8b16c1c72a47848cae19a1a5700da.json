These are churchmen who care for migrants, promote dialogue with Muslims and minister to the faithful in poor, far-flung missionary posts.\n\nWith Saturday's consistory, Francis will have named 52% of the voting-age cardinals. Many hail from churches in the developing world, a sign of Francis' desire to mirror the universal face of the Catholic Church in its leadership ranks.\n\n\"If I don't feel it, how can I share it, bear witness to it, bestow it on others?\" he asked in his homily. \"So many disloyal actions on the part of ecclesiastics are born of the lack of a sense of having been shown compassion, and by the habit of averting one's gaze, the habit of indifference.\"\n\nThe consistory comes at a fraught time in Francis' six-year papacy. Opposition is mounting among conservative Catholics who disapprove of his emphasis on the environment, migrants and other issues rather than the doctrinaire focus of his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nFrancis has acknowledged criticism in the U.S. church but shown no sign that such conservative outrage is hampering his agenda.\n\nA Canadian priest elevated Saturday, Cardinal Michael Czerny, said he thinks the criticism is coming from a small fringe with vested interests in developing the Amazon and pursuing other priorities incompatible with the pope's vision.\n\n\"He's meeting with some loud opposition. I don't think it's so much,\" Czerny told The Associated Press ahead of the consistory. \"I think it's loud.\"", "description": "Pope France adds 13 likeminded cardinals to Catholic hierarchy", "authors": ["Heather Donald"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/90/26/1000x563_cmsv2_584a231b-edea-5730-bef2-78654d538e90-4209026.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
