After nearly five months at home with her daughters, Hoda went back to work in early September.\n\n'There was probably a minute there where I was thinking to myself, \"I\u2019ve worked for, like, 30-plus years of my life and now I get this. Do I really want to be working while I\u2019m doing this?\"' she told Us Weekly.\n\nRole model: Hoda Kotb, 55, revealed she returned to the Today show after nearly five months on maternity leave because she wants her daughters to know that work is 'awesome'\n\nFamily: Hoda and her partner, financier Joel Schiffman, adopted their second child, Hope Catherine, in April, making their two-year-old daughter, Haley Joy, a big sister\n\n'But I think at the end of the day I realized I actually love work, and I want my kids to know that work is an awesome thing.'\n\nAfter spending so much time with her mom and little sister, Hoda said her eldest daughter didn't want her to return to her old routine.\n\n'Haley said to me when I was leaving for work, \"Don\u2019t go, stay home.\" But I said, \"Mommy loves work,\"' she recalled. 'I want her to be a worker.'\n\nUnlike most kids, Haley just has to turn on the TV in the morning to see her mom, and according to Hoda, her little girl will often tune in to the Today show after the news airs.\n\nThe Sesame Street fan has started to request that her mom 'wears a solid color' each day to match one of the show's Muppets, such as red for Elmo or yellow for Big Bird.\n\nIt seems the mother-of-two has done her best to appease her daughter's request as she has stuck to wearing mostly brightly colored sheath dresses since her return.\n\nCelebration: Hoda returned to the Today show on September 3, and her co-anchor Savannah Guthrie (left) couldn't have been happier\n\nKeeping her promise: Hoda (pictured last week) shared that Haley has asked that she 'wears a solid color' each day to match a Sesame Street character, such as yellow for Big Bird\n\nThanks to social media, fans were able to keep up with Hoda and her family throughout her entire maternity leave.\n\nThe journalist shared numerous photos of Haley feeding her little sister, playing in the sand, and meeting new friends.\n\nHoda and her longtime partner, financier Joel Schiffman, spent most of their summer at their beach house with their two girls.\n\nWhen they weren't at the beach, they were at their New York City home, where they received a number of visitors who were looking to meet baby Hope.\n\nHoda returned to the Today show on September 3 after spending Labor Day weekend with her family.\n\nAlthough it was undoubtedly difficult to leave her daughters, she told her co-workers that she was excited to come back.\n\nThings to consider: Hoda admitted that she questioned whether she really wanted to be working while raising her two young daughters\n\nLife lesson: When Haley asked her to stay home, Hoda said she told her little girl that she 'loves work.' She said she wants her eldest daughter 'to be a worker'\n\n'It did feel like Christmas morning a little,' she said of returning to Studio 1A. 'I went to bed last night I popped up at 3:15 and I was like, \"I get to come home!\"'\n\nPerhaps no one was more excited than her co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, who celebrated Hoda's first day back on Instagram.\n\n'Could. Not. Be. Happier,' she captioned a photo of herself on set with her friend.\n\nWhile everyone was happy to see her back, Hoda didn't have any regrets about taking such a long maternity leave.\n\n'It's been probably the greatest summer of my life,' she said. 'I thought I was topped out. Haley is beyond a dream, a wish, a hope, a prayer.\n\n'And just when you thought everything was to the max, Hope pops in, and you see your heart's ability to expand. Now, I cannot imagine my life without both of those two little girls.\n\n'I don't know what has happened in the world. I missed it \u2014 and I've missed it happily,' she added. 'The news of my life has been watching these two little girls change. You blink and it's different.'", "description": "Hoda adopted her second child, Hope Catherine, in April and spent nearly five months on maternity leave before she returned to the Today show in September.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19462800-0-image-a-49_1570570223788.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
