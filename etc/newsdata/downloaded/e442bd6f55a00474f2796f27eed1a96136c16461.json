When Equilar began tracking the measure in late 2016, 15% of board seats were filled by women.\n\nThe increases come amid calls for change from big investors and a new California law mandating female representation on public company boards. In July, the last all-male board among S&P 500 companies\u2014Dallas-based online car-auction company Copart Inc. \u2014added a female finance executive to its ranks.\n\nOther recent high-profile appointments of female directors include Starbucks Corp. executive Rosalind Brewer to Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s board and former Apple Inc. retail chief Angela Ahrendts to Airbnb Inc.\u2019s board. WeWork, recently renamed the We Co., is adding Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei to its board in advance of a planned initial public offering of stock. Google parent Alphabet Inc. named biopharmaceutical executive Robin Washington as a director and Boeing Co. added former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.\n\nThe California law, signed last September by then-Gov. Jerry Brown, requires all publicly traded companies with headquarters in the state to have at least one woman on their boards by the end of 2019 or face fines. So far, 68% of the 94 public companies in the state with all-male boards when the law passed have added at least one woman, according to Athena Alliance, a nonprofit that helps women land board directorships. They include semiconductor-testing company Cohu Inc., which added executive coach and Hewlett Packard alum Lynne J. Camp earlier this month, and cloud software firm Veeva Systems Inc., which added Mary Lynne Hedley, a pharmaceutical executive, in August.\n\nRoger Villareal, a spokesman for Veeva, said the company had a woman on its board at its founding and for much of its history. \u201cVeeva has always maintained diversity within our leadership and across the company,\u201d Mr. Villareal wrote in an email.\n\nThe mandate is having ripple effects beyond those companies that fall within its parameters, recruiters say. Companies outside California are also coming to Jana Rich, the founder and chief executive of San Francisco-based Rich Talent Group, an executive-search firm focused on diverse hiring, in search of women to add to their boards. She said they expect other parts of the U.S. to consider similar legislation soon.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to get ahead of the curve,\u201d she said. Companies preparing for an IPO have also tapped her to diversify their director ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, some women joining male-dominated boards have expressed concerns about being the first female directors. They ask, \u201cAm I really going to have a voice at this table?\u201d Ms. Rich said. \u201cHow long will I remain the only woman on the board?\u201d\n\nNearly 42% of new directors appointed in the second quarter to Russell 3000 boards were women, according to Equilar. That is down from 47% during the first quarter of the year. Of the women filling open board seats in the second quarter, 53% were serving on their first corporate board, while the remainder were veterans.\n\nMike Magsig, who leads the global CEO and board practice at executive-search firm DHR International, says companies have become more open to bringing on first-time female corporate directors. Meanwhile, employers are increasingly encouraging their female executives to sit on outside boards for career development. That has helped plump up a talent pool of potential female board members that had been \u201cdwindling rapidly,\u201d he said, as female business experts became overburdened with board appointments.\n\nSome companies worry that California companies complying with the state\u2019s mandate\u2014which requires some corporations to have at least three female directors by 2021\u2014will snap up top women candidates.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing really savvy private companies aggressively wanting to add women to their boards as well, so that they don\u2019t find themselves in another year or two with a lack of the talent they need,\u201d Mr. Magsig said.\n\nOthers are pushing back against the call to diversify. Some companies subject to the California law have told Mr. Magsig they are weighing just paying the fines\u2014which start at $100,000\u2014this year rather than add a woman to their board, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to let any government authority tell us how to run our company,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nA conservative group, Judicial Watch, last month filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleging the law is unconstitutional.\n\nMost companies seem to be banking on more edicts around diversity. Illinois\u2019s governor in late August signed a bill requiring public companies based in the state to report on the composition of their boards, by gender and ethnicity, as well as on how they promote diversity at the board and executive level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally thought that even if the [California] legislation is struck down, it\u2019s going to come back in a different form\u2014and let\u2019s just go ahead and comply regardless of the outcome,\u201d Mr. Magsig said.\n\nWrite to Rachel Feintzeig at rachel.feintzeig@wsj.com", "description": "One-fifth of board seats at the Russell 3000 index of public companies were held by women in the second quarter, up from 19% in the previous quarter and a sign of change as U.S. corporations face pressure to diversify.", "authors": ["Rachel Feintzeig", "Rachel.Feintzeig Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EY109_womenl_SOC_20190910164554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
