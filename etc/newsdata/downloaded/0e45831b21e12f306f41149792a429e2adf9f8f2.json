The Astros initially attempted to discredit the Sports Illustrated article that revealed the incident, but later backtracked under a hail of criticism \u2014 and after multiple reporters corroborated the details of the Sports Illustrated report.\n\nTaubman apologized for his language on Tuesday, and Major League Baseball said it was investigating the incident. And while Luhnow apologized for the incident in the radio interview, he also seemed to cast doubt on whether the incident played out as reported.\n\n\u201cWhat we really don\u2019t know is the intent behind the inappropriate comments he made,\u201d Luhnow said of Taubman. \u201cWe may never know that because the person who said them and the people who heard them, at least up to this point, have different perspectives.\u201d\n\nStarting Lineups\n\nThe Nationals will use the same lineup that propelled them to victory in Game 1.\n\n1.
