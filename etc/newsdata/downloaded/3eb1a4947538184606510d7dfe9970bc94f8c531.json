The stock closed Tuesday at $172.53 per share, up nearly 30% this year.\n\nGoldman likes Nvidia the best compared to some of its semiconductor peers. While the firm has a buy rating on Nvidia, it has a neutral rating on Advanced Micro Devices and a sell rating on Intel.\n\n\"We expect the company to deliver strong sequential growth in FY3Q (Oct) in the Gaming segment supported by the normalization in channel inventory and the launch of its new products,\" said Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari in a note to clients.\n\nGaming is Nvidia's largest segment, producing $1.31 billion in revenue in its second-quarter, reported last month. While the competitive landscape in the second half of the fiscal year may be more challenging that in the past, Hari said Nvidia's gaming segment will continue to grow.\n\nHari said in the long-term, the move into cloud gaming will be top of mind for Nvidia investors.\n\nNvidia's second biggest segment is its data center segment, which missed estimates for its $655 million in revenue in the second quarter. However, Hari said improving trends will drive growth going forward.\n\n\"We see yoy segment revenue growth reverting to positive territory in FY4Q (Jan) and accelerating further into 1HFY21,\" said Hari.\n\nGoldman expects overall 27% year-over-year revenue growth for Nvidia.\n\n\u2014with reporting from CNBC's Michael Bloom.", "description": "Goldman Sachs raised its price target on gaming technology company Nvidia to $192 from $179.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104887925-GettyImages-630995522-nvidia.jpg?v=1569410497", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
