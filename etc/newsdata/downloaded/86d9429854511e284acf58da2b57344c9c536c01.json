(Photo: Anthony Devlin - WPA Pool, Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. and UK governments are expected to sign a treaty in October that will force social media platforms based in either of the countries to \u201cdisclose encrypted messages from suspected terrorists, paedophiles and other serious criminals\u201d to police in the other, according to the Times of London.\n\nThe Times reported that UK Home Secretary Priti Patel is slated to soon sign the \u201cdata access agreement,\u201d which follows four years of \u201cintense lobbying\u201d by the UK to gain more direct access to data held on platforms like Facebook and its subsidiary WhatsApp. According to the paper, Patel said UK authorities\u2019 hands are currently tied by arrangements that restrict data-sharing to emergencies and a slow-moving treaty process:\n\nAt present the security services are only able to obtain data if there is a need for an \u201cemergency disclosure\u201d due to an imminent threat to life. The police and prosecutors can also request data under the \u201cmutual legal assistance\u201d treaty but the process is highly bureaucratic and can take up to two years. Under the new treaty, the police, prosecutors and the security services can submit requests for information to a judge, magistrate or \u201cother independent authority\u201d. The process will be overseen by the investigatory powers commissioner.\n\nUnder the terms of the proposed arrangement, both governments will agree not to investigate each others\u2019 citizens. The U.S. won\u2019t be able to use data obtained from companies based in the UK in death penalty cases unless UK authorities have explicitly given permission to do so.\n\nBloomberg confirmed news of the data sharing agreement as well. It\u2019s not clear whether the proposed arrangement actually requires companies to build backdoors into their encrypted products \u2014 something that law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been demanding for years, but which has been resisted by tech firms as any backdoor could be discovered by malicious third parties and compromise data for all users.\n\nAs Engadget noted, the arrangement may instead create an awkward situation in which companies are forced to turn over data that is \u201ceffectively unusable\u201d because it cannot be decrypted.\n\nAccording to the Times, Patel has warned platforms in the past that they could be enabling crime and terrorism. In one high-profile example, the UK government criticised Facebook for refusing to hand over the account password of a murder suspect on a discretionary basis, instead telling police to pursue the matter through U.S. courts; the information only arrived on the day of the suspect\u2019s trial.\n\n\u201cWe oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of our users everywhere,\u201d Facebook told Bloomberg. \u201cGovernment policies like the Cloud Act allow for companies to provide available information when we receive valid legal requests and do not require companies to build back doors.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. and UK governments are expected to sign a treaty in October that will force social media platforms based in either of the countries to \u201cdisclose encrypted messages from suspected terrorists, paedophiles and other serious criminals\u201d to police in the other, according to the Times of London....", "authors": ["Tom Mckay", "Julie Muncy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/cx9qzrznivi0ncasisl6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
