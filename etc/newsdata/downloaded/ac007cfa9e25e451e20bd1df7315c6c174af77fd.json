Viral Press\n\n\u201dI\u2019d heard of mums giving out little care packages when they have babies on planes \u2013 acknowledging that their infants might be crying.\u201d\n\nInspired, Ms Smith and her mother Ros put together 10 or so care packages, including chocolates, ear plugs and a hand-written note, for the 62-year-old to pass out to those around him.\n\nThe notes read: \u201cHi. Enjoy your trip today. We thought you might be in need of a little assistance if Alan falls asleep \u2013 so hope this little care package helps.\n\n\u201cLove and blessings, Ros and Grace.\n\n\u201cP.S. the snoring usually only lasts a short time \u2013 while he falls asleep.\u201d\n\nMs Tattersall called the care packages, which Ms Smith gave him at the airport, \u201ccheeky\u201d, saying: \u201cI knew I snored but I didn\u2019t think for a moment it was that bad.\u201d\n\nHowever, he took the comments on board, attempting to give out the packets on the return journey \u2013 a 32-hour trip involving three stopovers.\n\nHe said the hardest part was getting other passengers\u2019 attention: \u201cWhen people get on planes nowadays, they\u2019re immediately watching a film and putting their own headphones on anyway,\u201d he said.\n\nOne passenger appreciated the gesture though; according to Mr Tattersall, she \u201copened it up straight away and read the note. The others just thought it was strange and didn\u2019t know what to say, but she chuckled to herself.\u201d", "description": "A young woman worried about her stepfather\u2019s loud snoring made up care packages for him to hand out to fellow passengers on a flight.
