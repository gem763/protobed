If we\u2019re so close to the wire with what I believe is a better deal, it would be right to take those extra few days or weeks in order to land it and to make sure that we\u2019re out.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cIf, finally, it comes to a decision between no deal and no Brexit, I will choose no deal. It\u2019s a democratic imperative that we must leave the EU before the next general election.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Who is standing to be the next prime minister?

This is just the reality of the situation. Some have said stick with the current deal, but that\u2019s been shown to fail. Others say let\u2019s just run at no deal, but the brutal truth is we know that won\u2019t get through the House of Commons.\u201d\n\nMark Harper\n\n\u201cThe bit where I will make myself perhaps not popular with colleagues is when I say it is not going to be possible to leave on 31 October. I would love to [but] I\u2019m afraid it is not credible to say you can renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and get it through both houses of parliament by 31 October \u2026 I think if we approach our European partners in a spirit of openness and we bust a gut to get a deal and they are simply not prepared to budge, I think in those circumstances and only those circumstances, there will be a majority in the House of Commons to leave without a deal.\u201d\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\n\u201cGet this wrong and the EU could block a better deal, and parliament could block no deal. We could be stuck in paralysis ... [but] I\u2019ve got the plan to deal with Brexit. I believe as foreign secretary there is a deal to be done. If we approach this the right way with the right negotiating skills, we can get a deal even before the end of October. Lots of people say it will be impossible but ... I like to prove people wrong.\u201d\n\nSajid Javid\n\n\u201cAs prime minister I would have a clear position. We should leave on 31 October. And if we cannot get a deal we should, with great regret, leave without one, having done everything we can to minimise disruption.\u201d\n\nBut he added separately: \u201cI will change the dynamic [of negotiations] by offering the money to pay for the [Irish] border [technology]. It is justified that we do that because, economically, if that unlocks a deal we will have a mini economic boom in this country that will pay for that.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson\n\n\u201cAfter three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on 31 October. We simply will not get a result if we give the slightest hint that we want to go on kicking the can down the road with yet more delay. Delay means defeat. Delay means Corbyn. Kick the can and we kick the bucket. With every week and month that goes by in which we fail to deliver on our promise I am afraid we will further alienate not just our natural supporters but anyone who believes that politicians should deliver on their promises.\u201d\n\nAndrea Leadsom\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

So instead of being a perfectionist about a withdrawal agreement, you then start to look at, well, OK, they\u2019re leaving by the end of October, what can we do that works well for us and for them that we\u2019ve already negotiated and agreed previously?\u201d\n\nEsther McVey\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be asking for any more extensions. That\u2019s part of the corrosive uncertainty that individuals and businesses in the country don\u2019t want ... so we need to make sure that we are ready to leave on that date [31 October]. Now if the EU wants to come back to us, the door is open. If they want to have a better deal, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ve always wanted a free trade agreement. But what we\u2019ve got to do is not waste time. We have to make sure that we are ready to leave.\u201d\n\nAsked if she would take the unprecedented step of suspending parliament to force through no deal, she said: \u201cWe would use all the tools at our disposal.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That\u2019s the only way we will focus the EU\u2019s minds. That\u2019s the only way you give yourself the best shot of getting a deal.

So we can get to a deal.\u201d\n\nSeparately, he emphasised his hostility to crashing out of the bloc, adding: \u201cMy opposition to no deal is unwavering \u2013 the best and securest way to take no deal off the table is to vote for me to be our next prime minister.\u201d", "description": "It is the defining issue of the age and is, unsurprisingly, dominating the Conservative leadership race.
