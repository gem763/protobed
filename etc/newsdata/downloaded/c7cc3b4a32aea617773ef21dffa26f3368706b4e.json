Almost all of the surgical patients \u2014 97 percent \u2014 also underwent hormone treatment. Less than one-third opted for neither treatment.\n\nThe investigators found that those who underwent surgery were 8 percent less likely to reach out for mental health care services in the first year after surgery. Those services included mood and anxiety disorder treatment, antidepressant and anti-anxiety prescriptions, and/or hospitalization following a suicide attempt.\n\nThe declining trend among post-op patients continued unabated for a decade, dipping an additional 8 percent each year, the findings showed. No similar benefit was linked to undergoing hormone treatment alone, however.\n\nThe findings are important given the greater overall need for mental health services in this group, compared to the general population, the researchers stressed in a news release from the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nFor example, these patients are roughly six times more likely to seek care for a mood or anxiety disorder. They are also more than three times as likely to seek prescriptions for antidepressants and/or anti-anxiety medication.\n\nHowever, gender reassignment surgery did not serve as a cure-all. In fact, the study authors warned that even after surgery, transgender patients remained more in need of mental health services than their general population peers.\n\nThe findings were published online Oct. 4 in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\u2019s more about gender confirmation surgery at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
