The meeting had been scheduled for the next day.\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s comments, made to reporters as he left for a campaign rally in North Carolina, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was said to be hopeful that there was still a flicker of life in the Taliban talks and that a way to restart them would emerge. In Sunday talk show interviews, Pompeo said the negotiations were off \u201cfor the time being\u201d but emphasized the progress that had been made.\n\nState Department negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad returned to Washington on Monday for meetings with senior officials to discuss what had happened and where to go from here.\n\nDissension within the administration over the issue \u2014 centered on Pompeo\u2019s support for the negotiations, national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s opposition, and their competition for policy dominance and presidential favor \u2014 is \u201creally heating up,\u201d according to a senior administration official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\n[Collapse of Afghanistan peace talks spotlights internal Trump administration divisions]\n\nA second senior official described similar Bolton-Pompeo tensions and predicted that, whatever Trump may say now, the issue of negotiations was far from dead. Just as Trump first threatened and then was eager to talk to the leaders of North Korea and Iran, this official said, the president will eventually be willing to make a deal with the Taliban.\n\nAmong those trying to stay out of the firing line, Vice President Pence joined Trump in disputing reports that he had opposed the Camp David meeting but was overruled by the president. \u201cThis Story is False!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday afternoon, saying that \u201cthe Dishonest Media likes to create the look of turmoil in the White House, of which there is none.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Absolutely Right Mr. President,\u201d Pence tweeted in response. \u201cMore Fake News!\u201d\n\nThe second senior official said Pence had helped talk Trump out of his initial idea to hold the meeting with the Taliban at the White House and was opposed to any meeting at all.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump arrives at in Fayetteville, N.C., for a campaign rally Monday. Before he left Washington, he told reporters that he was no longer interested in meeting with Taliban leaders. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nJust as the future of U.S.-Taliban negotiations remained in doubt, military officials were noncommittal about whether the U.S. troop cuts the deal envisioned would go ahead.\n\n\u201cThe number of troops that we will have will always be the appropriate level that we need to provide security there,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on the counterterrorism mission, and we\u2019re going to focus on the reason we got into Afghanistan in the first place, and that is to prevent terrorist operations or individuals from using Afghanistan as a base from which to operate against the homeland.\u201d\n\nIn Kabul, President Ashraf Ghani called on the Taliban to negotiate with him but warned that attempts to increase its attacks on the ground would be met with a ferocious military response. For its part, the Taliban refrained from public statements, and its negotiators were believed to be consulting militant leaders based in Quetta, Pakistan.\n\n[Afghans welcome Trump\u2019s cancellation of Taliban peace talks]\n\nNo further U.S.-Taliban talks are scheduled, and the nearly completed agreement, negotiated by Khalilzad over the past 10 months, appears dead for now. A meeting between Afghan officials and Taliban leaders \u2014 agreed to as part of the U.S.-Taliban deal and scheduled to be held in Oslo on Sept. 23 \u2014 has been canceled, according to European officials who were in charge of organizing it. A donors conference to fund post-deal political talks among the Afghans, scheduled for next week in London, is up in the air.\n\nTalk of a cease-fire in the almost 18-year-old war, on the agenda for the Oslo meeting, has now disappeared, as both the United States and the Taliban have pledged to step up their battlefield attacks.\n\nIn his remarks to reporters, Trump claimed full credit for both setting up the Camp David meeting and canceling it.\n\nThe subject was first broached, according to an official familiar with White House deliberations, in a \u201cprincipals only\u201d meeting at the end of August. Held in the Situation Room, it included Pompeo and Khalilzad, with Bolton joining via videoconference from overseas.\n\n\u201cIt was my idea,\u201d Trump said Monday of inviting the Taliban and Ghani to Washington. \u201cI took my own advice. I like the idea of meeting. . . . I think meeting is a great thing,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, wars would never end.\u201d\n\nOthers familiar with the meeting said they could not confirm who first brought it up. Trump said he had nixed a suggestion that it be held at the White House \u2014 which others recalled he had proposed himself \u2014 because \u201cthat would be a step too far.\u201d But, he said, there was precedent for hosting negotiations among warring foreigners at Camp David.\n\nAs Khalilzad explained the pact, it would allow the initial withdrawal of about 5,000 U.S. troops in exchange for a Taliban commitment to break relations with al-Qaeda and a pledge that it would allow no terrorist organizations with designs on the United States to exist in territory under Taliban control.\n\nBolton, who had opposed the negotiations since they started last October, argued that Trump could withdraw the same number of troops without any deal with the Taliban.\n\nWhile State Department officials came away from that August meeting believing that Trump \u2014 eager for a campaign-promised withdrawal \u2014 was on board with the terms of the deal, some inside the White House insisted that the president had never considered it a done deal and wanted to put his own stamp on the negotiations.\n\nBolton and others who opposed negotiating with the Taliban \u2014 let alone inviting its leaders to Washington \u2014 continued to raise questions about the agreement, noting that Taliban attacks had increased in recent months.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department drew attention to a rise in U.S.-backed Afghan government attacks against the Taliban and stepped-up U.S. airstrikes. Additional violence was to be expected in the lead-up to an agreement as both sides sought leverage.\n\nAlthough the Camp David aspect of the negotiations was a closely held secret, those who knew about it \u2014 supporters and opponents alike \u2014 worried that it was a bad idea. Trump\u2019s concept was that he would meet separately with Ghani and the Taliban leaders, satisfy them and himself that the deal was adequate, and then announce it.\n\nThe Taliban, queried by Khalilzad in Doha, Qatar, expressed trepidation but did not refuse. Ghani reluctantly agreed, if only to avoid being seen as a peace spoiler.\n\nTrump revealed the plan in the same Saturday night tweet that canceled it. Far from listening to his advisers, he said Monday, \u201cit was my idea to terminate it. I didn\u2019t even discuss it with anybody else.\u201d\n\nThe reason, he said, both in the Saturday tweet and Monday\u2019s comments, was the death Thursday morning of a U.S. service member killed in a Taliban attack. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do that with me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, they\u2019re dead as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said of the negotiations.\n\nBut others noted that 16 Americans have been killed by hostile fire this year in Afghanistan, including one just a week before the most recent death \u2014 after Trump was briefed on the peace agreement and sent Khalilzad back to the region to finalize it.\n\nEven as those differing on the wisdom of negotiations plotted different futures, few within the administration mourned the cancellation of the Camp David meeting. \u201cThis is a dodged bullet,\u201d said one senior official.", "description": "Some officials hope the talks can be revived to facilitate troop withdrawals.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Missy Ryan", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "Military Issues", "National Security", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tmcx0IgidOa6M8pJwPODH0lQPpw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YNMJL3WTLII6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
