Probably. This is something that they\u2019ve de facto campaigned on for nearly three years. The impeachment of Donald Trump because he won the 2016 election was not a question of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when.\u2019 But this is mostly an issue that appears to get the professional elite in the Democratic Party excited. There are other issues for the 2020 cycle. In Pennsylvania, a must-win state for both sides, Democrats in the western part of the state are not happy with the Democrats\u2019 2020 agenda. They\u2019re not thrilled their party is anti-fracking and pushing an agenda that will gut their health insurance. For Medicare for All to work, all private plans have to go, which includes those for union workers. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report noted this recently, adding there is a chasm where Democrats can fall if they come off as too insane. These folks are also not happy with the prospect of Lie-a-Watha Liz winning the nomination either:\n\nSpent yesterday w/ a group of mostly union, anti-Trump Ds in western PA. Massive concerns about how a Warren nomination (esp. pledge to ban fracking on day one) would play out in the region.\n\n\n\nDon't underestimate how many voters in SWPA, etc. there are still left for Ds to lose. \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 10, 2019\n\n2016 Clinton votes in the city of Philadelphia: 584,025\n\n\n\n2016 Clinton votes in western PA *outside* the city of Pittsburgh: 631,120\n\n\n\nYes, there's still a lot of room for Dems to fall. \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 10, 2019\n\nThe problem is that they already have jumped off the cliff into the left-wing abyss. They\u2019re for gutting private health insurance, they want a wealth tax, forgive student loan debt, enact the Green New Deal, hate cops, want to make abortion permissible up until the moment of birth, and give illegal aliens health care benefits\u2014while promoting an open borders agenda. This isn\u2019t just conservatives saying the Democrats have gone off the deep-end, former Obama officials have as well. David Axelrod, a former top adviser to Obama, lamented about the appalling approval numbers at the core of the 2020 Democratic agenda, noting that it\u2019s important to listen to voters and what they want. That\u2019s funny\u2014Democrats hate voters and think their small, elite brain trust is what should be entrusted to make and enforce all of their authoritarian and ruinously expensive policy positions. On the flip side, Trump has to ensure that he can be competitive in the collar counties around Philadelphia, specifically Buck County, where he split with Hillary 48-48, but that result was enough for him to clinch the state, as he ran up the score in the \u2018T\u2019 counties between Philly and Pittsburgh.\n\nHe needs to do that again, and defecting Trump Democrats who are not thrilled with their party and see him as the lesser of two evils doesn\u2019t hurt either. Katie also noted that in Michigan, impeachment isn\u2019t a popular sticking point with blue-collar workers.\n\nYet, Wasserman also noted that the independent voter who thought Trump was going to drain the swamp, but didn't and got cozy with Mitch McConnell might be a seam that the Democrats could exploit. The problem is that with impeachment theater engulfing the Hill, will the Left temper their tantrum for a second and find a way to speak to voters that isn't insane.\n\nMy working theory...there were two types of indies who voted for Trump in 2016:\n\n\n\n1) voters who liked idea of an unfiltered (entertaining?) prez who drove politicians/media crazy\n\n\n\n2) voters who saw DC as 100% broken and wanted to try something totally different to get stuff done \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 4, 2019\n\nThe first group of indies has pretty much got the president \u201cas seen on TV\u201d in 2016. No letdown there.\n\n\n\nBut the second group is where Dems\u2019 opportunity lies. He hasn\u2019t \u201cdrained the swamp\u201d or proven adept at \u201cart of the deal\u201d on infrastructure, immigration, etc. Dysfunction rules. \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 4, 2019\n\nMoral of the story: Dems aren\u2019t likely to win many more converts by attacking Trump\u2019s behavior/style.\n\n\n\nBut they can probably win converts by arguing he fell right in line with the \u201cswampy\u201d Rs (esp. McConnell) to take away healthcare/cut taxes for rich & has made DC even worse. \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 4, 2019\n\nEditor's Note: Sorry folks, misread one of the tweets as one of the reasons being impeachment for PA Democrats. Not the case ... post has been updated as a result.", "description": ".10/11/2019 20:10:47PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/283/126a4ddf-7e02-49b1-aca8-bd84db02a2f4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
