The two types were distinguished by their armour and weapons.\n\nIt is the latest discovery in Regio V, a 21.8-hectare (54-acre) site to the north of the archaeological park that is yet to open to the public.\n\nThe fresco was found on a wall beneath the stairwell of what was probably a tavern frequented by gladiators and which provided accommodation on a higher floor for them to sleep with sex workers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The fresco was discovered on a wall in what was probably a tavern frequented by gladiators. Photograph: Pompeii archaeological park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very probable that this place was frequented by gladiators,\u201d said Massimo Osanna, the director general of Pompei\u2019s archaeological park. \u201cWe are in Regio V, not far from where there was a barracks for gladiators, where among other things, there was graffiti referring to this world.\n\n\u201cOf particular interest in this fresco is the very realistic representation of wounds on the wrist and chest of the unsuccessful gladiator \u2026 we don\u2019t know the outcome of the fight, he could have died or was given grace.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A well-preserved \u2018fast food\u2019 counter was unearthed in March. Photograph: Massimo Ossana/Instagram\n\nExcavations at Regio V have yielded dozens of discoveries since work began last year as part of the EU-funded Great Pompeii Project. A frescoed \u201cfast food\u201d counter, or thermopolium, was found in March and another depicting the mythological hunter Narcissus enraptured by his own reflection in a pool of water was discovered in February. Human remains have also been found, including the skeletons of two women and three children huddled together in a villa, as well as the remains of a harnessed horse and saddle.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An archaeologist inspects the remains of a horse skeleton in Pompeii\u2019s archaeological site.

It is a welcoming site, but above all we have returned to doing research through new digs.\n\n\u201cThe discovery of the fresco shows that Pompeii is an inexhaustible mine of research and knowledge for today\u2019s archaeologists and for those of the future.\u201d", "description": "Well-preserved find on wall beneath stairwell is latest discovery at Regio V site", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf42fd3fc263df78531de39b1defb3273f23d417/0_29_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17b04b32f36a8a69b433e9f149f1ae5b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
