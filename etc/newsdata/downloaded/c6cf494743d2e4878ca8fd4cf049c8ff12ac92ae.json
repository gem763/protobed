Details were sparse at the time. On Sept. 22, Pompeo appeared on several Sunday shows as the face of the administration. Asked about Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky and about a whistleblower complaint from a member of the intelligence community, Pompeo claimed ignorance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNearly two weeks later, Pompeo confirmed news reports that he was on the July 25 call between the two presidents.\n\nPompeo gave careful answers in the Sept. 22 interviews. But they were disingenuous, laden with deflections and omissions that gave a false impression of what he knew. Let\u2019s dig into the timeline of events.\n\nJuly 25: Trump in a phone call asks the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, a potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, and Hunter Biden, according to a readout of the conversation released by the White House. Here\u2019s Trump making the request:\n\n\u201cThe other thing, There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d (In making this request, Trump falsely claimed that Biden as vice president stopped Ukrainian prosecutors from pursuing a case involving his son.)\n\nAug. 12: An intelligence community whistleblower files a complaint based on Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate Biden and related issues. It reads in part: \u201cAccording to the White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call, the President pressured Mr. Zelenskyy to, inter alia: initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSept. 20: The Wall Street Journal reports that \u201cPresident Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son.\u201d The Washington Post and other news outlets confirm that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.\n\nSept. 22: Pompeo appears on ABC News, CBS News and Fox News. The second half of his interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d covers Ukraine.\n\nJohn Roberts, Fox News: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know the exact substance of the complaint, but it does seem to revolve around a July 25th conversation the president had with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And we have heard from reporting in the Wall Street Journal that the president asked Zelensky about eight times to have the Ukraine work with his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement in Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. To your mind, is that an appropriate conversation for Rudy Giuliani to be having with Ukrainian officials?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cWell, John, you\u2019re asking me to comment on an IG report I haven\u2019t seen and some reporting \u2014 I have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s deceptive. Pompeo mentions reports of the July 25 phone call and adds, \u201cI have no idea if that has any foundation whatsoever.\u201d No idea?\n\nRoberts presses a few more times, but Pompeo avoids mentioning the July 25 phone call or his direct knowledge of what Trump and Zelensky discussed. Here\u2019s another exchange:\n\nAD\n\nRoberts: \u201cAgain, I assume that you\u2019ve seen the transcript. Is it as described in the Wall Street Journal?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t seen the Wall Street Journal piece, John. There\u2019s a lot going on in the world.\u201d\n\nUsually a secretary of state is up-to-date on major topics in the news and prepares for obvious questions before speaking on national television for the administration. But Pompeo didn\u2019t need to read news reports or a transcript of the July 25 phone call to remember what was discussed. He was on the phone call.\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s yet another attempt by Roberts:\n\nRoberts: \u201cIf there was a quid pro quo, would that be a problem?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cJohn, you\u2019re asking me to provide legal analysis on a hypothetical on a report I haven\u2019t seen. Come on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bit much to see Pompeo describe this question as a hypothetical. He didn\u2019t need any report to tell him what was discussed because he had direct knowledge of Trump\u2019s request to Zelensky.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Pompeo\u2019s interview with Martha Raddatz of ABC News on \u201cThis Week,\u201d also on Sept. 22:\n\nRaddatz: \u201cAnd I want to turn to this whistleblower complaint, Mr. Secretary, the complaint involving the president and a phone call with a foreign leader to the director of national intelligence inspector general \u2014 that\u2019s where the complaint was launched by the whistleblower. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. What do you know about those conversations?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cSo, you just gave me a report about a I.C. whistleblower complaint, none of which I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nNotice how Raddatz frames her question broadly, asking Pompeo what he knew about Trump\u2019s \u201cconversations\u201d with Zelensky. Pompeo frames his response in terms of the whistleblower complaint and again dances around the July 25 phone call.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s a conversation Pompeo had direct knowledge of, so his response to Raddatz was deeply disingenuous. Here\u2019s another exchange:\n\nRaddatz: \u201cYou say you know nothing about this, but let me \u2014 let me \u2014 let me ask you this question. The Ukrainian presidential readout of the conversation said they discussed, quote, \u2018investigation of corruption cases which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u2019 The president tweeted Saturday, \u2018It was a perfectly fine and respectful conversation.\u2019 Do you think it\u2019s, quote, \u2018perfectly fine\u2019 to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent?\u201d Pompeo: \u201cI think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday, said there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Pompeo is asked squarely about the July 25 conversation, and once again, he bobs and weaves. Pompeo referred selectively to comments from the Ukrainian foreign minister when he could have volunteered direct knowledge of the phone call and Trump\u2019s request to Zelensky. Combined with his other answers, the effect is misleading.\n\nAD\n\nSept. 24: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announces a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nSept. 25: The White House releases the readout of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky.\n\nAD\n\nSept. 26: The whistleblower complaint is made public.\n\nSept. 30: The Journal reports that Pompeo was on the July 25 phone call, a fact not previously known. The Associated Press and CNN add confirmation.\n\nOct. 2: During a visit to Italy, Pompeo confirms the reports that he was on the July 25 phone call. \u201cAs for, was I on the phone call? I was on the phone call,\u201d Pompeo says in Rome. \u201cThe phone call was in the context of \u2014 now, I guess I\u2019ve been the secretary of state for coming on a year and a half \u2014 I know precisely what the American policy is with respect to Ukraine. It\u2019s been remarkably consistent, and we will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe asked whether Pompeo had a role preparing or briefing Trump for the July 25 phone call with Zelensky, and if so, whether the request to investigate the Bidens came up in the preparations. The State Department did not respond to our questions.\n\nOct. 3: Pompeo gets Four Pinocchios for repeatedly hiding the truth from viewers on Sept. 22.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nAD", "description": "The secretary of state repeatedly misled television viewers as reports about Trump and Ukraine began to surface in September.", "authors": ["Salvador Rizzo", "Reporter For The Fact Checker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EM54zlYXEEznzNaT9n5wOKOfPSY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZIWVVBXEMEI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
