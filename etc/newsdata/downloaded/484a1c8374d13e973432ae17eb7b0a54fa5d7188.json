It was Mifsud who told Papadopoulos about the dirt the Russians had on Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails,\" a tip Papadopoulos blurted out to an Australian diplomat in an indiscretion that reached the FBI and started the ball rolling.\n\nBarr\u2019s interest is all part of a broader effort pushed obsessively by President Donald J. Trump in an effort to prove, at least in the public mind, that he was the victim of a conspiracy in 2016 rather than the beneficiary of one. Trump\u2019s pressure on the recently elected government in Ukraine to promote this line features in the impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nBarr Went to Rome to Hear a Secret Tape From Joseph Mifsud, the Professor Who Helped Ignite the Russia Probe\n\nBut that has only led his administration and supporters to push harder the notion of a sinister \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy to derail his presidential campaign. Where the pressure on Ukraine was partly the work of Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani operating outside official channels, Attorney General Barr\u2019s probe is now a criminal investigation into the origins of the counterintelligence probe into Trump\u2019s Moscow connections.\n\nAnd Professor Mifsud is right in the middle of it.\n\nThe teams led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI reported that Mifsud, who disappeared from public view in late 2017, received his information about the Clinton emails through highly placed members of the Russian government, and suggested that he may even have been a Russian agent.\n\nThe teams led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI reported that Mifsud, who disappeared from public view in late 2017, received his information about the Clinton emails through highly placed members of the Russian government, and ex-FBI Director James Comey, fired by Trump, even said that Mifsud was a Russian agent.\n\nBarr and his boys are operating on a different theory\u2014that Mifsud was part of a setup by the CIA and FBI to smear Trump. Pursuing this theory, Barr even went abroad recently to talk with Italian and British intelligence officials about Mifsud, who taught at universities in both Britain and Italy.\n\nBut Mifsud's deep, long-standing connections with Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy establishment and the highly favorable views he has expressed publicly about Russia's role in global affairs show just how far Barr has barked up the wrong tree.\n\nTHE PROFESSOR\n\n\n\n\n\nJosef Mifsud, born in Malta in 1960, earned a doctorate in early childhood education from Queen's University, Belfast, in 1995. He had a stint at the Maltese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and did some teaching in Slovenia and the University of Stirling in Scotland before becoming the director of the so-called London Academy of Diplomacy in 2012. As columnist Nick Cohen pointed out in The Guardian, it resembled \"just the type of front organization an espionage agency would establish.\" And when the academy shut down after the Russia scandal erupted in the United States it was as if \"it were an intelligence asset whose cover had been blown.\"\n\nMifsud, who briefly employed the Italian wife of Papadopoulos when he was affiliated with a socialist group in the European Union, was by all accounts terrific at networking. After beginning frequent trips to Russia in 2010, he was soon hobnobbing with Kremlin-linked Russians as an expert on international diplomacy, despite his lack of credentials in that field. In 2012 his academy formed a collaboration with Moscow State University, where Mifsud became a regular visitor. And in May 2014, he was received personally by the Russian ambassador to London, Alexander Yakovenko\u2014an unusual honor for someone of Mifsud's minor stature\u2014to discuss the lofty subject of \"Russian-British cooperation in the sphere of international relations, diplomacy, science and education.\"\n\nOne of Mifsud's key Russian contacts was Ivan Timofeyev, a young mover and shaker in the Russian foreign policy establishment, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes over 80 published articles on international affairs.", "description": "Alex Wong/GettyAttorney General William Barr has been looking into the Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud, whose discussion with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos helped set off the FBI investigation of possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016.\u00a0It was Mifsud who told", "authors": ["Amy Knight"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W7Q4rngqDzDDENIQs5aZzg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/746f42cc821dfc498be3c1e947993fe1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
