USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL has been pulling out all the stops to celebrate its centennial campaign (frankly, we've done the same).\n\nUnfortunately, what's largely been a forgettable season on the field (aside from the officiating issues) and an unfortunate one off of it \u2014 goodbye Andrew Luck, goodbye Antonio Brown, goodbye Ben Roethlisberger \u2014 might have suffered its cruelest blow Thursday night when reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes was knocked out in the first half of the Chiefs' game at Denver with a knee injury.\n\nIt's premature to speculate on the severity of Mahomes' problem, which was a dislocated patella, according to multiple reports. But tea leaves being what they are, it sure was troubling to see how quickly Kansas City's medical staff ruled him out following \u2014 according to a report from Fox's Erin Andrews \u2014 a quick trip to the X-ray room shortly after Mahomes took a shot to that knee on a quarterback sneak.\n\nPATRICK MAHOMES: Reigning NFL MVP suffers knee injury vs. Broncos\n\nFOOTBALL FIX: NFL news and exclusive analysis delivered to your inbox\n\nPatrick Mahomes is helped off the field after being injured against the Broncos.

Welp ...\n\nIn the short term, we could be deprived of watching one of the game's brightest stars, arguably the most electrifying passer in the league \u2014 who else can throw it left-handed out of the stadium while blind-folded and still looking off a defender? Exaggeration, sure, but Mahomes has quickly become Bunyan-esque given his estimable talent and ability to leverage the elite pass catchers the Chiefs have placed around him.\n\nBut long term, if Mahomes' knee lands him on injured reserve \u2014 again, premature speculation \u2014 we're almost certainly going to spend the next three-plus months waiting to see who the Patriots will face in Super Bowl LIV.\n\nThe Chiefs, who took New England to overtime in last season's AFC Championship Game \u2014 and you can mark the Patriots down for the upcoming conference title tilt on Jan. 19 given that they haven't missed one since the 2010 season \u2014 were already showing cracks in the armor in recent weeks, the \"blueprint\" to beat them entailing lots of man-to-man coverage, limiting the pass rush against Mahomes (gimpy of late on a bum ankle) and, most important, keeping him off the field by ramming the ball relentlessly into Kansas City's porous run defense.\n\nAnother blueprint for beating the Chiefs is forcing them to play journeyman backup quarterback Matt Moore.\n\nBut if the Kansas City bandwagon does come to a stop in the breakdown lane, another will take its place, right?\n\nPerhaps the ...\n\n\u25ba Baltimore Ravens, who occasionally play defense, rack up more yards than anybody else right now, feature a Michael Vick-level weapon at quarterback in Lamar Jackson and have a history of giving the Patriots fits in January. But what do the Patriots do in January? They take away your best player ... and if a New England defense off to a historically good start puts the clamps on Jackson, what's left in Baltimore's holster?\n\n\u25ba Cleveland Browns, whose hype train now seems pretty well derailed but will next pull into Foxborough following a Week 7 bye. But even if the Brownies catch fire, you gonna bet so many young, immature players \u2014 particularly those on offense operating behind a sieve O-line \u2014 are going to oust Belichick, who led Cleveland to its last playoff win in the 1994 season? Nope.\n\n\u25ba Buffalo Bills, a tough team off to a 4-1 start who gave the Patriots a dogfight in Week 4 ... and a group that doesn't have much firepower on offense and a young quarterback prone to boneheaded decisions who would have virtually no shot at decoding New England in the playoffs.\n\n\u25ba New York Jets, who were intriguing on paper in August and also last week when they knocked off the first-place Cowboys. But the smart money is on the Patriots dealing any postseason aspirations they still harbor a mortal blow this Monday night.\n\n\u25ba Houston Texans, who are 1-10 against Belichick in their history and 0-5 with ex-Pat (expat?) Bill O'Brien calling the shots. Nice team with some nice players ... and a franchise that's never advanced beyond the divisional round. Deshaun Watson could make an MVP push in 2019, especially if Mahomes is no longer a contender, but I shudder to think of his fate against this Patriots defense given the suspect state of his blocking.\n\n\u25ba Indianapolis Colts, who have a nice team and a coach you'd want to play for in Frank Reich. If Luck comes out of mothballs in the next few weeks, let's revisit.\n\n\u25ba Oakland Raiders, who are building something with a nice core of young players. Maybe they can also bury the ax with Brown and bring him back for some revenge against Belichick. Or maybe they're still a year or two or three away \u2014 hey, it's gonna take time to get settled into the Vegas Strip \u2014 and more likely to get Tuck Ruled again by Tom Brady and Co. than run them off the road to the Super Bowl. Knock on wood if ... ah, never mind.\n\n\u25ba Los Angeles Chargers, my preferred dark horses and perhaps the only other team that could stand toe-to-toe with the reigning champs ... if Derwin James, Melvin Ingram, Russell Okung and a suddenly inept run game all return in time to salvage what's fast becoming a flameout of a season.\n\nLet's hope Mahomes is OK. The NFL is a heckuva lot more fun when he's slinging it and surely needs his scintillating talent to sustain the #NFL100 celebration.\n\nBut even if he's able to recover close to 100%, I'm not picking the Chiefs to win the AFC. However, I'd sure like the chance to pick against them rather than see the Patriots enjoy a 16-week bye before heading to South Beach for what suddenly feels like an inevitable berth to defend their crown in South Florida.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
