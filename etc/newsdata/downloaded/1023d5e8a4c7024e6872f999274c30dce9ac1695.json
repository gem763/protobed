But under the layers of rubble, a one-year-old puppy was found.\n\n\n\nFlorida-based Big Dog Ranch Rescue spotted the mixed breed puppy last Friday via an infrared drone used to sense heat of survivors, The Washington Post reported. Trapped under an air-conditioner for three weeks, the dog survived off rainwater that fell in front of him in Marsh Harbour, a neighbourhood on the Great Abaco Island.\n\n\"Look at that tail wagging!\" volunteer Sean Irion said during a video of the rescue, where he is seen holding out a can of dog food for the puppy. \"We've got you.\"\n\nLauree Simmons, president and founder of Big Dog Ranch Rescue, told The Post that the puppy was flown to Florida for treatment. He'd lost over 9kgs in body weight from weeks of immobility. His emaciated state called for care that includes antibiotics, gradual feeding, and physical therapy, but Simmons told the Post that they expect him to make a full recovery.\n\nLUCKY DOG: \"Big Dog Ranch Rescue\" volunteers from Florida using a drone with infrared technology discovered a dog trapped for weeks in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian, naming him \"Miracle\" and nursing him back to health. @DavidMuir reports. https://t.co/OrBujSExZh pic.twitter.com/XYUqwyxEWE \u2014 World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) October 8, 2019\n\nSimmons told The Post the rescue plans to wait for 30 days for his owners to claim him, but will put him up for adoption if no one claims him. Big Dog Ranch Rescue CEO Christopher Kraus told Good Morning America they've already \"had about 10,000 inquiries for a forever home\" coming from all over the world.\n\n\"They keep pouring in,\" Kraus told GMA. Kraus added that the dog is \"doing well\" and has gained four pounds since being found.\n\nThe one-year-old puppy was one of over 100 dogs that the group has rescued from the wreckage of Hurricane Dorian, and about half of those animals have been reunited with their original owners, Good Morning America reported.\n\nOverall, Simmons told The Post that the dog's rescue in the face of the devastation of Hurricane Dorian represents that \"there's hope for rebuilding and a new beginning.\"\n\n\"It's a miracle this little dog had the will to live and to survive in the conditions he was in,\" Simmons told The Post.\n\nAnd like his rescue, the one-year-old fighter was named Miracle.", "description": "\"It's a miracle this little dog had the will to live and to survive in the conditions he was in,\" founder of Big Dog Ranch Rescue Lauree Simmons said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2861/34b438202ba44050bcfa54b0b8703bb6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
