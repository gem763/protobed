Bryan Fulwider was accused of raping the girl more than 100 times since 2005 when she was 14 years old, the Orlando Sentinel reported.\n\nEmergency crews responded to reports of a suicide at Fulwider\u2019s home around 11:50 p.m. Sunday when Fulwider was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe Seminole County Medical Examiner\u2019s office ruled Fulwider\u2019s death as a suicide.\n\nFulwider, 59, had been released from prison out on bail since October 17. The former co-host of \u201cFriends Talking Faith\u201d faced multiple charges, including one count of sexual battery on a minor by a person of authority, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\nHe faced up to life in prison if sentenced on the charges. Fulwider pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked at the death by suicide of Bryan Fulwider. Our sympathies are with his family in their time of anguish,\u201d the show stated on its Facebook page. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with the victim or victims in this case that will now not have their day in court and receive the justice due to them.\u201d\n\nFulwider\u2019s accuser told the Sentinel on condition of anonymity that her alleged attacker was a coward and hinted that there could be more victims of his out there.\n\n\u201cFulwider\u2019s day in court will never come because he knew all the truths I could tell,\u201d the woman told the paper.\n\nThe First Congregational Church, where Fulwider preached, is still \u201ctrying to absorb the impact of all the events,\u201d according to a statement from the church\u2019s current senior minister the Rev. Shawn Garvey.\n\n\u201cFor now, all we can do is pray for Bryan\u2019s family and the victim (to) at some point, find a path to healing,\u201d Garvey wrote in a statement.", "description": "A Florida pastor and Christian talk radio show host killed himself after he was accused of repeatedly raping a teenage girl.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Bryan-Fulwider-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
