The archived image, however, shows Ms. May holding a single-use paper cup with no logo.\n\nMs. May said she was \u201ccompletely shocked\u201d when she learned that staff had edited the image without her knowing.\n\n\u201cI was completely shocked to find that the party had photoshopped an image of me from last year\u2019s Sidney Street Market,\u201d she said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cMy personal daily practice is to avoid single-use plastic items 100% of the time. I never drink from plastic water bottles. I always carry my own reusable coffee cup. I carry my own bamboo utensils.\n\n\u201cI walk the talk every day,\u201d she added. \u201cI hope that despite this misstep by well-meaning party staff (who hoped to brand the image with our logo), people can believe that in the original photo there is nothing I would have hidden.\u201d\n\nMs. May defended her use of the single-use cup because paper cups are compostable. Her party is pushing for a ban on single-use plastics.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
