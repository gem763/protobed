Harbour went through it and that is where he encountered Davidson.\n\nHarbour asked if \u201cthis,\u201d meaning the Upside Down, was where he had been so far all season.\n\n\u201cYeah dude, it\u2019s lit, right?\u201d Davidson responded.\n\nDavidson then asked if Harbour died at the end of the third season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d to which Harbour stammered around the answer: \u201cI\u2019m not exactly authorized \u2014 just watch the show, you\u2019ll find out next season.\u201d\n\nIn the Studio 8H Upside Down, a Demogorgon attacked Beck Bennett, and Harbour found Aidy Bryant tied to a wall.\n\n\u201cBarb, are you OK?\u201d he asked. Although she corrected him, she did need help. \u201cI won\u2019t forget about you, Barb!\u201d he yelled as he wandered off.\n\nUber-producer Lorne Michaels also appeared in the sketch, sitting at a NBC page desk and saying \u201ceverybody\u2019s got to start somewhere.\u201d This meant Kenan Thompson was running the show.\n\n\u201cI was basically running the show out there, too,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nLater in the show, Davidson also returned to the Weekend Update desk to give his take on the CDC report that sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and chlamydia are at an all-time high, due to dating apps.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are all things you can cure with a shot. I don\u2019t know how this is even new, really.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that he understands people can be worried about STDs, but he gets \u201ctested all of the time because I look like I have all of them and I might have created my own.\u201d But, he continued, the ones Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost just mentioned can be cured quickly. \u201cThe flu can last a month, but syphilis is like four days. Bring it on,\u201d he said.\n\nDavidson also wanted to point out that these dating apps have helped people date outside of their race, religion and social class. \u201cYou\u2019re going to risk all that ethnic harmony just to keep a few busted pipes from dripping? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair,\u201d he said.\n\nDavidson said he heard that joke and looked it up and \u201cit was not me.\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, Colin, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen \u2018Joker,\u2019 but you should start being way nicer to me,\u201d he said.\n\nPreviously this season, Jost made a Weekend Update joke about Davidson\u2019s absence on the show when reading a news item about a man who could not remember where he parked a car a week after he drove it to a music festival. \u201cWell, we hope you make it back, Pete,\u201d Jost said with a smile.\n\nReportedly, Davidson missed the earlier episodes due to filming \u201cSuicide Squad.\u201d He was seen in a photo on writer and director James Gunn\u2019s Instagram on Sept. 28, the night of the Season 45 premiere.\n\nWatch David Harbour\u2019s \u201cSNL\u201d monologue below:\n\nWatch Pete Davidson on Weekend Update below:\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d airs live coast-to-coast Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET/8:30 p.m. PT on NBC.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
