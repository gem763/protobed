Bernie Sanders is spotlighting that his presidential campaign has received contributions from one million individual donors.\n\nThe independent senator from Vermont\u2019s campaign \u2013 in announcing the news on Thursday \u2013 touted that Sanders was the fastest presidential candidate in history to reach that fundraising milestone \u2013 as well as the first Democrat this election cycle to reach the threshold.\n\n\u201cWith 1 million contributors, this is the only Democratic campaign that has more supporters than Donald Trump,\u201d campaign manager Faiz Shakir highlighted. \u201cOur strength is in numbers, and that is why Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who is able to say his campaign will rely only on grassroots funding in both the primary and against Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS\n\nSanders has relied almost entirely on small, online donations from supporters, and rarely has held fundraisers. Despite abstaining from the high-dollar finance events that some of his top rivals for the presidential nomination have held, Sanders has stayed competitive in the dash for campaign cash.\n\nHe reported an $18 million haul in the April-June quarter of fundraising this year. That placed the populist senator third behind South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($24.9 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($22 million) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ($19.2 million), the other progressive standard-bearer in the record-setting field who\u2019s also eschewed big-bucks fundraisers this year.\n\nWHERE BERNIE SANDERS STANDS IN FOX NEWS' LATEST 2020 POLL\n\nThe Sanders campaign noted that 99.95 percent of its donors were able to contribute again.\n\nThe Sanders fundraising news came as the candidate \u2013 who once was clearly in second place behind Biden, the front-runner \u2013 was now neck and neck with Warren in most of the latest national and early voting state polls.", "description": "Sen.
