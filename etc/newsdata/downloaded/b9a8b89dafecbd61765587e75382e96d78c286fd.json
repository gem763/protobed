You\u2019re sitting there, minding your own business, when all of a sudden an armed individual shows up and steals your car out of nowhere. The sudden, terrifying nature of such an attack has got to rattle you.\n\nHowever, carjackers aren\u2019t necessarily a particularly bright bunch. After all, it doesn\u2019t take a master criminal to stick a gun in someone\u2019s face and take their car. This isn\u2019t Gone In 60 Seconds we\u2019re talking about here.\n\nNo, it\u2019s a violent assault on an individual with the potential for the shedding of innocent blood.\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s absolutely hilarious when the problem sort of takes care of itself.\n\nA carjacker died after he accidentally blasted himself in the chest while trying to smash a window with the butt of his shotgun, an inquest has heard. Officers investigating the death of Reece Ramsey-Johnson said they were satisfied there was \u2018no third party involvement\u2019 as they closed the probe into his killing. Witnesses who saw the 22-year-old dying from gunshot wounds in the street outside a Lloyds bank in Sydenham on Sunday, September 8, said his own gun may have gone off when he used to to hit a car window. Opening the inquest at Southwark Coroner\u2019s Court on Thursday September 26, Dr Andrew Harris confirmed the police investigation had now ended. He said: \u2018The investigating officer is satisfied there is no third party involvement.\n\nNow, this was a UK carjacker and not the American variety of the breed, but it\u2019s still the feel-good story of the day, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nIt also suggests that British gun control laws aren\u2019t nearly as effective as some want to claim them to be. After all, if someone like this snotnosed punk could get a shotgun, they can\u2019t be all that hard to obtain on the black market that I\u2019ve been assured doesn\u2019t really exist in the UK.\n\nTo be sure, Ramsey-Johnson got precisely what he deserved, regardless of where he was located. Such criminals should always meet such ends. At least here in the United States, we can arrange for them to meet those ends. In the UK, you have to hope and pray it\u2019s someone of Ramsey-Johnson\u2019s\u2026intellect. That\u2019s what it takes to make sure predatory jackwagons get precisely what they deserve.\n\nHonestly, though, I\u2019m actually a bit baffled at just how stupid you have to be to shoot yourself in the chest while trying to bust a car window. I get that they don\u2019t have the gun culture we do, but it shouldn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that you don\u2019t point your gun at yourself while you smash the firearm against a window. This is especially true if there\u2019s something like a finger on the trigger.\n\nAt this point, Ramsey-Johnson\u2019s death isn\u2019t just a feel-good story, but a prime example of nature adding a little chlorine into the gene pool. My only hope is that this jackwagon hadn\u2019t already reproduced and thus spread his idiocy to a whole new generation.", "description": "A British carjacker took himself out of the equation by blasting himself in the chest with his own shotgun.
