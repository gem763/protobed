CPS support staff are also striking, and are represented by SEIU Local 73. CTU teachers have worked under an expired contract for more than 100 days.\n\nProud to support teachers & school staff braving the weather outside my district office. I'm happy to open my office so they can warm up. As they organize for better working conditions & resources for students, I urge the parties to continue negotiations. #IStandWithTeachers pic.twitter.com/ZrsWE4i8P1 \u2014 Congressman Chuy Garc\u00eda (@RepChuyGarcia) October 21, 2019\n\nThe strike has led to citywide closure of school hours, though buildings have stayed open to provide meals and safe areas for students to stay. The school district developed a contingency plan for students to be supervised by non-unionized staff, but there has been no academic instruction or after-school programming with the exception of Chicago\u2019s more than 100 charter schools, which are operating as scheduled.\n\n\u201cWe could end this within a couple days, but there would need to be a commitment on the mayor\u2019s part to do that,\u201d Sharkey told local reporters Monday in response to the letter.\n\nCTU took to Twitter on Monday to express frustration with Lightfoot\u2019s letter, saying: \u201cWhen we said \u2018put it in writing,\u2019 this isn\u2019t what we meant.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom lies about our salary, to her intransigence on makeup days, to cancelling classes Oct. 17 before delegates could convene, to chiding us about \u2018urgency\u2019 when she has yet to come to the table, to painfully obvious photo ops, to today\u2019s letter,\u201d the union tweeted Monday. \u201cAll bad.\u201d\n\nIt took a strike to get the district to agree to FOLLOW STATE LAW regarding Pre-K staffing ratios. CPS is under state oversight for special ed violations. That's just two reasons why we're out here. We can\u2019t trust them to do right by students if we go back without a contract. \u2014 ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 21, 2019\n\nThe union has primarily asked for smaller class sizes and more special education teachers, nurses and social workers, among other demands like fair pay and housing policies. The union said Sunday that the two sides have since the walkout made a tentative agreement for specific staff positions to support homeless students, and CTU got contractual language included that the district will follow Illinois law in maintaining a ratio of one adult for every 10 students in a pre-K classroom. Lightfoot also proposed investing about $2 million to get a nurse and a social worker in every school.\n\n\u201cIt should be expected to have a social worker and nurse in a school community. [Lightfoot] mocked us when we talked about the 20,000 homeless students in the system,\u201d CTU Vice President Stacy Davis previously told HuffPost. \u201cThe CPS has a history of segregation, and it has a history of inequity.\u201d\n\nLightfoot said at a press conference Monday that CTU is asking for too much money, and that the union is being unreasonable by continuing to strike despite the mayor proposing solutions to two of the biggest demands.\n\nLIVE: Mayor Lightfoot addresses members of the press https://t.co/hfzVqjZuh4 \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cBeyond what we\u2019ve put on the table, there is simply no more money,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters. \u201cWe can only agree to what we can afford. There are not unlimited resources to fund everything in a single contract that CTU wishes. The money on the table is all there is.\u201d\n\nCTU stressed that its demands are not new, and the union has been bargaining all year. The union said it submitted proposals in January, but did not receive \u201cresponsive counterproposals in writing\u201d until teachers went on strike.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take two days of being on strike to get students\u2019 needs met \u2015 needs in a school district that serves 90 percent students of color, and students who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty, violence and Great-Depression era levels of unemployment,\u201d the union tweeted.\n\nIn their letter to Sharkey, Lightfoot and Jackson stressed that student-athletes are missing out on tournaments, high school seniors are concerned about college applications and many students are put at risk without the safety, food access and structure that school provides.\n\nSharkey acknowledged that the strike has been difficult for families and school staff, but that \u201cno one wants to get back into the classroom more than the teachers in the city of Chicago.\u201d\n\nUnion members have also voiced anger that Lightfoot had campaigned on the very promises that teachers wanted when she was elected mayor earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe mayor ran on an education platform \u2015 our education platform \u2015 to improve our schools and the quality of life for students, parents, educators and school communities,\u201d the union tweeted Monday. \u201cEverything she has done as of late has been anything but an improvement, and has only made the situation worse.\u201d\n\nLightfoot penned an op-ed Monday in the Sun-Times in efforts to assure residents that she is still committed to her campaign promise of promoting \u201ceducational equity,\u201d specifically in public schools. In the op-ed, the mayor said she respects workers\u2019 right to organize but is disappointed that CTU is striking when she believes her contract offers are \u201cfair and respectful\u201d of the union\u2019s demands.\n\nCPS tweeted Monday evening that the union had not scheduled the vote necessary to end its strike, resulting in class cancellations for Tuesday, the fourth school day since the walkout began. Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will be in Chicago on Tuesday to support CTU\u2019s strike, her campaign confirmed.\n\nAs of 4 p.m., CTU has not scheduled a House of Delegates vote, which would be necessary to end their strike. As a result, it will not be possible to hold classes tomorrow, 10/22. After school programming will not be available at CPS schools. pic.twitter.com/flX6cyCDzM \u2014 ChicagoPublicSchools (@ChiPubSchools) October 21, 2019", "description": "The Chicago Teachers Union rejected Lori Lightfoot's request to halt the strike during contract negotiations as the walkout reached its third school day.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae2fe9200000571c506589.jpeg?cache=nhazmio3xa&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
