If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nIn this case, Bj\u00f6rn Borg likely looks attractive to investors, given its 9.3% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Bj\u00f6rn Borg for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Bj\u00f6rn Borg!\n\nOM:BORG Historical Dividend Yield, October 2nd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Bj\u00f6rn Borg paid out 86% of its profit as dividends. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Bj\u00f6rn Borg paid out 429% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. Paying out such a high percentage of cash flow suggests that the dividend was funded from either cash at bank or by borrowing, neither of which is desirable over the long term. Bj\u00f6rn Borg paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Bj\u00f6rn Borg's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Bj\u00f6rn Borg's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Bj\u00f6rn Borg's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was kr1.50 in 2009, compared to kr2.00 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 2.9% per year over this time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 2.9% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.\n\nWe're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments, we don't think this is an attractive combination.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Bj\u00f6rn Borg has grown its earnings per share at 22% per annum over the past five years. A majority of profits are being paid out as dividends, which raises the question of what happens to the current dividend if earnings decline. However, the rapid growth in earnings may indicate that is less of a risk.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Bj\u00f6rn Borg AB (publ) (STO:BORG) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/irJPAqU7riiR.R2bdNv.Yg--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/535300c14f69f51814acdd11ccd6c69e", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
