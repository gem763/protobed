(But he\u2019s making movies anyway.)", "language": "en", "text": "It was around the same time that Soderbergh announced his retirement from directing. Although he did retreat from feature films, he produced and directed several episodes of the Cinemax series \u201cThe Knick,\u201d only to surprise and delight his fans in 2017 by re-emerging with the left-handed caper comedy \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d followed by the psychological thriller \u201cUnsane,\u201d which he filmed on an iPhone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Soderbergh\u2019s reports of his own retirement turned out to be premature, he believes that the trends he identified have only taken hold more strongly in the ensuing years. (Certainly the debates he ignited have only gotten hotter. Martin Scorsese just delivered his own version of Soderbergh\u2019s movies-vs.-cinema thesis when he suggested that Marvel films are more akin to theme parks than \u201cthe cinema of human beings,\u201d provoking \u201cAvengers\u201d avengers to assemble far and wide.)\n\nDuring a recent visit to Washington, Soderbergh was no more optimistic than he was in 2013. \u201cThe speech I gave in San Francisco six years ago still holds, in terms of what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not working,\u201d he said flatly.\n\nOne thing that has changed is that streaming sites have largely stepped into the breach created by the studios\u2019 blockbusters-only business model, lavishing Soderbergh, Scorsese and their fellow auteurs with profligate amounts of money to make their passion projects. Earlier this year, Soderbergh released another iPhone film, \u201cHigh Flying Bird,\u201d on Netflix, which is also releasing his new film \u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d a darkly comic anthology film based on the corrupt tax-avoidance schemes revealed in the 2016 release of the Panama Papers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201c \u2018The Laundromat\u2019 is the perfect example of something that I think doesn\u2019t get made [anymore] at a studio,\u201d Soderbergh said. \u201cThis is a midrange-budgeted film for grown-ups [that\u2019s] just not something the studios are seeing as a viable business.\u201d\n\nWhile bricks-and-mortar exhibitors go to war with streamers over how many days movies must play in theaters before being made available on television and while fanboys and cineastes fight over what counts as a movie, Soderbergh has been surfing the economic and technological disruptions like a Zen master. For the most part, he has stuck with the same nimble, format-and-platform-neutral course he\u2019s followed for a career that\u2019s been markedly protean, starting with his breakout film \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape,\u201d through such classical genre exercises as \u201cOut of Sight\u201d and the Ocean\u2019s Eleven franchise and Oscar winners such as \u201cTraffic\u201d and \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d up to and including such straight-to-video experiments as \u201cBubble\u201d and the old-school black-and-white World War II drama \u201cThe Good German.\u201d\n\nPart of what has made Soderbergh so distinctive is his lack of preciousness, both in terms of how he captures his images and how they\u2019re seen. He\u2019s not a celluloid purist and is an eager adopter of nascent technology. \u201cEarly on in my career, even if I was shooting on film in the \u201980s, I was transferring to video and cutting on video,\u201d he observes. \u201cI was constantly on the hunt for the new wave of iterating.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Laundromat\u201d \u2014 which stars Meryl Streep, Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas \u2014 is yet another example of the spontaneity that Soderbergh prizes. It\u2019s constructed of various chapters \u2014 which Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns constantly shuffled before production started \u2014 illustrating the arcane financial dealings that allow criminals and the superwealthy to protect their assets in offshore accounts while remaining unaccountable to the millions of people who are victimized by the shady practices of anonymous shell companies and unethical lawyers. Because the issues it examines are so complex, Soderbergh found himself showing the film to friends and family throughout the editing process, cutting out massive amounts of material if he caught them zoning out. \u201cIt was just information overload,\u201d he recalls. \u201cPeople just got tapped out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn November, Soderbergh will release \u201cThe Report,\u201d a film he produced for Burns to write and direct. Linear where \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d is kaleidoscopic, methodical where \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d is interpretive, sober-minded where \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d is irreverent and wry, \u201cThe Report\u201d stars Adam Driver as Senate staffer Daniel Jones, who wrote the 2012 intelligence committee report about the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program during the war on terror. Both \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d and \u201cThe Report\u201d continue a theme that has animated Soderbergh\u2019s work throughout his career, in which he deconstructs multilayered, largely invisible systems that condition contemporary life, whether in the form of the drug trade in \u201cTraffic\u201d; corporate malfeasance in \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d \u201cThe Informant!\u201d and \u201cSide Effects\u201d; or globalization in \u201cContagion\u201d (the last three of which Burns also wrote).\n\n\u201cEverybody is subject to these forces,\u201d Soderbergh explained. \u201cWe\u2019re all living in the middle of some system, some political system, some system at work. You can\u2019t escape it. So I guess I\u2019m interested in how you navigate that, especially when you\u2019re dealing with a system that\u2019s corrupt or dehumanizing. How does that sustain itself and what happens when you go up against it?\u201d\n\nNearly two decades after \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d and \u201cTraffic\u201d were released, movies seem to occupy a shrinking cultural space, not only in terms of artistic importance, but in their ability to forge social consensus around themes and issues. Back in 2013, Soderbergh maintained that audiences gravitated toward escapism in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, as a form of coping with trauma they had never fully processed. He stands by what he calls that \u201ccrackpot theory,\u201d and is less optimistic than ever that we\u2019re capable of engaging with substantive \u2014 and maybe unpleasant \u2014 ideas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn a world that feels like it\u2019s getting more complicated, a lot of people revert back to a sort of reptile-brain position, just because it\u2019s quick and easy,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe have this very Western secular idea that most people want certain freedoms and they want certain choices, when in fact a lot of people on this planet actually want freedom from choice. They actually want to be told what to do and what to think. . . . And that\u2019s an interesting thing to confront. Someone who doesn\u2019t really want to look at the situation holistically and say, \u2018What\u2019s the best version of this for the [greatest number] of people?\u2019 That\u2019s strange. As the son of a teacher, that\u2019s not how I was raised.\u201d\n\nHow Soderbergh was raised, to judge by \u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d was to dissect, analyze, diagnose but, finally \u2014 and maybe surprisingly \u2014 to care. Although the film hews to a sardonically jaundiced tone for most of its running time, its ambushes filmgoers in its final scene, when structures and identities we took as a given fall away to reveal a deeply personal message that, coming from a filmmaker known for his steady-eyed dispassion, feels jarringly sincere.\n\n\u201cI felt like it had to be,\u201d Soderbergh explained. \u201cTo play fair, a little bit. At a certain point you have to sort of blow away the ironic stance . . . and declare yourself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky enough to work in a business that\u2019s about telling stories \u2014 it sounds stupid, it\u2019s not legislating \u2014 but I do feel you have a responsibility. Whether it\u2019s something as hyper-stylized as \u2018The Laundromat\u2019 or something as hyper-real as \u2018The Report,\u2019 it should make sense. Even on its own terms, you should be able to defend it and go, \u2018Well, the math works.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD", "description": "With \u2018The Laundromat,\u2019 Soderbergh examines another invisible system that conditions modern life.", "authors": ["Ann Hornaday", "Movie Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2TJaSG2HgZZsQ3GWugh-F8BsdUg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DKDNO7CBAII6TERMMTLLPBALQI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
