It is that simple,\u201d Rep. Steve Russell (R-Okla.), a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said in an interview with The Hill.\n\nRussell\u2019s comments came after Pyongyang\u2019s latest intercontinental ballistic missile test on Tuesday, which analysts said demonstrated a capability that could extend to the U.S. East Coast.\n\nRussell said Kim needs to stop threatening the U.S. and its allies or face the consequences.\n\n\u201cDictators have one thing in common \u2014 they want to stay alive; if Kim Jong Un wants to stay alive, he needs to stop. If he doesn\u2019t, I can assure you based upon all of the activity that I have been involved with on Armed Services and also in foreign affairs \u2014 he is playing a dangerous game where he will not only be annihilated, but other people will suffer greatly,\u201d he said.", "description": "If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doesn\u2019t quit his country\u2019s nuclear and ballistic tests, he could wind up with a \u201cdate with death,\u201d according to a GOP member of the House Armed Services Committee.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/kim_john_un_.png", "published_at": "2017-11-29"}
