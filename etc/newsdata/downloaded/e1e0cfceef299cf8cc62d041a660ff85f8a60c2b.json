Sputnik/Dmitry Astakhov/Pool via REUTERS\n\nANKARA (Reuters) - The spike in global oil prices on Monday was expected as prices need to reflect risks after an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure, Russian energy minister Alexander Novak told reporters late on Monday.\n\nThe attack on Saudi Arabia that triggered the biggest jump in oil prices in almost 30 years was carried out with Iranian weapons, a Saudi-led coalition said on Monday, as President Donald Trump said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to hit back.\n\n\u201cEveryone expected the prices to rise somewhat on Monday, because the price takes into account uncertainty and risks. I think the market will be reacting on the situation based on the information that will be coming out from Saudi Arabia,\u201d Novak said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in an airplane on their way back to Moscow from Ankara on Monday evening, Novak said he did not have time to talk to Saudi energy minister as Novak was busy at talks between leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran held on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe can talk (later). Our specialists are in contact,\u201d Novak said. Russia is an ally of Riyadh in a global pact to curb supply.\n\nThe leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran met in Ankara on Monday and agreed to try to ease tensions in northwest Syria\u2019s Idlib region, but disagreements between the countries appeared to linger, especially over the threat from Islamic State.\n\nWhen asked whether there was the need to call for a meeting between Russian oil producers and the ministry to update their approach after the Saudi incident, Novak replied with a question: \u201cWhat kind of approaches can be developed if we do not have any information?\u201d\n\nEarlier on Monday, Novak said there was enough oil in global stockpiles to replace barrels Saudi Arabia had temporary lost due to the attacks.", "description": "The spike in global oil prices on Monday was expected as prices need to reflect risks after an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, Russian energy minister Alexander Novak told reporters late on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430725004&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0DQ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
