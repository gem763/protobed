Those suffering from the illness \u2014 which has resulted in 18 fatalities thus far \u2014 report experiencing an onset of pneumonia-like symptoms, including severe cough, shortness of breath, fever and fatigue. Seventy percent of those affected are male and more than 80 percent are under the age of 35.\n\nNew letter describes 17 patients, all of whom vaped, who had lung biopsies after presenting with symptoms and bilateral pulmonary opacities that led to a clinical diagnosis of #vaping-associated lung injury. https://t.co/n5rF2OOOwq \u2014 NEJM (@NEJM) October 2, 2019\n\nExperts from both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration have been scrambling to find what\u2019s fueling the illnesses \u2014 with some suggesting that it\u2019s a build-up of oil \u2014 either flavoring or vitamin E oil \u2014 in the lungs. Others have implicated THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, after reports that the majority of those with the illness used a vape containing it. But with others saying they only used nicotine, no single ingredient or product can be cited as the cause.\n\nHowever, in an October 2 study titled Pathology of Vaping-Associated Lung Injury, researchers from the Mayo Clinic may have gotten one step closer to an answer. In the report, the researchers analyzed the biopsies from 17 patients who developed a severe lung illness related to vaping \u2014 two of whom had died as a result. The biopsies showed no signs that a buildup of oil in the lungs was to blame. Instead, the images resembled those of individuals who had been exposed to toxic chemicals \u2014 suggesting that there may be other, as-of-now unidentified contaminants at play.\n\n\u201cWhile we can't discount the potential role of lipids [oils], we have not seen anything to suggest this is a problem caused by lipid accumulation in the lungs,\u201d Brandon Larsen, MD, PhD, a surgical pathologist at Mayo Clinic in Arizona and one of the lead researchers wrote in the study. \u201cInstead, it seems to be some kind of direct chemical injury, similar to what one might see with exposures to toxic chemical fumes, poisonous gases and toxic agents.\u201d\n\nVaping-related illnesses now top 1000 nationwide.

In a video put out by the Mayo Clinic explaining the study, Larsen expanded on the shocking findings. \u201cWhat we see with these vaping cases is a kind of severe chemical injury that I\u2019ve never seen before in a tobacco smoker or a traditional marijuana smoker,\u201d Larsen said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve only seen the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nLarsen says one of the difficulties of finding the culprit is how many different products are on the market, but that the goal of the analysis was to find \u201cwhat\u2019s really happening\u201d in the patients\u2019 lungs. \"Universally, all of these patients had what appeared to be ... a toxic chemical fume injury in the lungs,\u201d said Larsen. \u201cSo the injury in the lung looks like a caustic chemical injury that then will injure the lining of the airways \u2014 which is not surprising because that\u2019s how the vaping aerosol enters the lungs through the airways and then the lung tissue surrounding those airways will often have the same types of changes.\u201d\n\nOverall, he hopes that those reading about the vaping crisis understand how dangerous it is proving to be. \"Everyone should recognize that vaping is not without potential risks, including life-threatening risks, and I think our research supports that,\" Larsen said. \"It would seem prudent, based on our observations, to explore ways to better regulate the industry and better educate the public, especially our youth, about the risks associated with vaping.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A new study from the New England Journal of Medicine is showing evidence that lung injuries from vaping resemble \"chemical burns.\" An expert says it may be just the beginning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q.CFRPd27g3Jp0rc3mnnPQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/09bac1e0-e541-11e9-9cab-4d27048b97bd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
