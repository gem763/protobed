Its shares fell 1.9% in after-hours trading.\n\nSocial media companies, including Twitter rival Facebook Inc (FB.O) face growing pressure to stop carrying ads that spread false information that could steer elections.\n\nFacebook has pledged efforts to deal with misinformation after Russian propaganda on the platform was seen to affect the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which was won by Trump, a Republican.\n\nBut Facebook made a decision to not fact-check ads run by politicians, drawing ire from Democratic candidates running in the 2020 presidential election such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that Twitter recognizes that they should not permit disproven smears, like those from the Trump campaign, to appear in advertisements on their platform,\u201d said Bill Russo, deputy communications director for the Biden campaign, in an emailed statement.\n\nBiden has faced attacks from Trump, offered without evidence, about the foreign business dealings of his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cIt would be unfortunate to suggest that the only option available to social media companies to do so is the full withdrawal of political advertising, but when faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out,\u201d said Russo.\n\nBrad Parscale, who is running Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, described Twitter\u2019s move as an \u201cattempt to silence conservatives\u201d and \u201ca very dumb decision\u201d for the company\u2019s shareholders.\n\n\u201cWill Twitter also be stopping ads from biased liberal media outlets who will now run unchecked as they buy obvious political content meant to attack Republicans,\u201d Parscale said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known.\u201d\n\nA Twitter spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s policy, saying it did not want to stifle political speech.\n\nDorsey wrote on Twitter that paying for ads forces \u201ctargeted political messages on people\u201d with a power that \u201cbrings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was not credible for Twitter to say it was trying to stop the spread of misleading information \u201cbuuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad...well...they can say whatever they want!\u201d\n\nJasmine Enberg, a senior analyst for research company eMarketer, said Twitter\u2019s decision \u201cis in stark contrast to Facebook\u201d but added that political advertising is not likely a critical part of its business.\n\n\u201cAnd, given the nature of the platform, people, publishers and politicians will still use Twitter to discuss politics organically, meaning that it won\u2019t fully solve the problem of misinformation,\u201d she said.\n\nDavid Herrmann, president of Hermann Digital LLC, a Los Angeles-based independent media buyer who works with direct-to-consumer brands, said he disagreed with the notion of banning political ads on any network, including Twitter.\n\n\u201cBanning political ads doesn\u2019t hurt presidential campaigns, it hurts local politics that are dependent on reach from paid\u201d ads, he tweeted.", "description": "Twitter Inc will ban political advertising on its platform next month, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday, a move that won praise from Democrats and scorn from Donald Trump's presidential campaign.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446665318&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1VG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
