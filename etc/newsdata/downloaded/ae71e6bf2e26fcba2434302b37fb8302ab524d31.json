Then he fashioned a sort of tunic out of a plastic garbage bag.\n\nDos Anjos told the photographer that his mother scolded him when she saw the pictures, which were published by major news organizations around the world.\n\n\u201cI had asked her permission to help clean the beach and she said yes, so long as I did not get dirty,\u201d the boy said.\n\nFour days after the photo was taken, not much oil remained on the beach. The army had taken over the clean-up operation, and children were no longer allowed to help. Since the beginning of this spill more than 1,000 tons of oil have been recovered, according to the Brazilian navy.\n\nThe spill was first spotted on August 30 off the coast of northeast Paraiba state, and it has now spread along 2,250 kilometers (1,400 miles) of coast, soiling beautiful beaches in a poor region heavily dependent on tourism. Some 200 towns have been hurt.\n\nEnvironmental groups have complained that the government was slow to respond to the crisis and failed to provide proper resources for tackling what many specialists called the worst environmental disaster ever to hit northeast Brazil.", "description": "Cabo de Santo Agostinho (Brazil) (AFP) \u2013 A boy walks ashore in Brazil in filthy waist-high water with a look of exasperation and his body smeared in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/fd578a_boy-wades-ashore-covered-oil-on-itapuama-beach-in-northeast-brazil-on-21-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
