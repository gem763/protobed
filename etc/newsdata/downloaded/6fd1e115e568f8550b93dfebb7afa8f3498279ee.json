(AP) - The Braves are shutting down Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. for the remainder of the regular season after the All-Star outfielder left their series opener against the Royals with tightness in his left hip.\n\nBraves manager Brian Snitker said Wednesday that Acu\u00f1a was examined by the Royals\u2019 team physician, who recommended that he sit until the playoffs. Snitker said the decision is largely precautionary, and Acu\u00f1a can continue to throw and hit while sitting out games.\n\nAcu\u00f1a, who left Tuesday night\u2019s game after the second inning, is hitting .280 with 41 homers, 101 RBIs and 37 stolen bases. He\u2019s also scored a National League-leading 127 runs.\n\nThe Braves already have clinched the NL East and will start the divisional round of the playoffs against the NL Central winner on Oct. 3 at SunTrust Park in Atlanta.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Braves are shutting down Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. for the remainder of the regular season after the All-Star outfielder left their series opener against the Royals with tightness in his left hip.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/giants_braves_baseball_73706_c0-173-4132-2582_s1770x1032.jpg?d0727b45f0217c741d30a85ee51dabe63663a21d", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
