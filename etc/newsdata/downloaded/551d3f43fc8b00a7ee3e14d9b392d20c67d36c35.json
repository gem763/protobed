REUTERS/Naseer Chaudary\n\nMajor international teams have avoided touring Pakistan since a 2009 militant attack on Sri Lanka\u2019s team bus in Lahore left six security personnel and two civilians dead while six players were injured.\n\nPakistan have been forced to play most of their \u2018home\u2019 matches in the United Arab Emirates, but have hosted teams such as Zimbabwe and West Indies in recent years.\n\n\u201cI think be it Pakistan, or any other country that has faced similar situation, we need to make sure cricket keeps going,\u201d Misbah told reporters ahead of Friday\u2019s first one-day international against Sri Lanka in Karachi.\n\n\u201cWe need to do more, the world cricket needs to do more to make sure that we play series here on regular basis and cricket is not affected.\n\n\u201cWe understand that this wasn\u2019t an easy decision... but it is encouraging sign to see Sri Lanka coming here for series.\u201d\n\nTen Sri Lankan players opted out of the tour over security fears but their cricket board confirmed the series after being assured of head-of-state-like security by the Pakistan government.\n\nMisbah said a full-strength Sri Lanka team would have made it a more exciting contest but still expects a competitive white-ball series in front of packed stadiums.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing at home ground, you\u2019re also different at emotional level. It will be an important moment for all the players,\u201d the former Pakistan captain added.\n\n\u201cIt is also important for youngsters to play in front of home crowd and home ground. It is key for them to play in front of packed stadium. You can\u2019t attract crowd at neutral venue.\u201d\n\nThe remaining two one-dayers will also be held in Karachi on Sunday and Wednesday, while the three Twenty20 internationals will be played in Lahore on Oct. 5, 7 and 9.", "description": "Pakistan head coach Misbah-ul-Haq has requested the support of more cricket-playing nations as the country takes another step towards the revival of international matches on home soil with a limited-overs series against Sri Lanka in Karachi and Lahore.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434032511&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0C6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
