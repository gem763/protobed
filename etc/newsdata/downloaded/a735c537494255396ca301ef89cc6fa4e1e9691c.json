This is just preliminary information,\u201d Minnis told a news conference.\n\n\u201cMarsh Harbor has suffered, I would estimate, in excess of 60 percent damage to their homes,\u201d Minnis said, referring to the port on Great Abaco.\n\n\u201cThe Mud, as we know, has been completely destroyed or decimated,\u201d he said in reference to a shantytown known as the Mud and the Peas.\n\n\u201cVictims are being loaded on flatbed trucks across Abaco,\u201d\n\nsaid one Twitter poster with the handle @mvp242, describing a rain-blurred photograph of limp bodies strewn across a truck bed. Other Twitter messages said whole communities were swept away.\n\nMinnis said he saw people waving for help in a community near Coopers Town on Great Abaco, after it was cut off by floods.\n\n\u201cThere were around 30 people trapped and waving yellow flags, sheets and shirts to bring our attention to their survival.\u201d\n\nA video posted on Twitter showed a storm surge rising up inside a two-story home, the sofa and other furniture floating toward the second floor. Another showed residents trying to swim from one home to another through the surge.\n\nIn another, a woman repeatedly says, \u201cPlease pray for us,\u201d after the storm ripped the roof off her apartment building, exposing her, and other residents, to the elements as she struggled to shelter her 4-month-old baby.\n\n\u201cSome people the water just sucked them,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nReports from Grand Bahama island, and its main town of Freeport, have been more sketchy. The weather has made it impossible for relief agencies to get through, Minnis said.\n\nThe Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said storm surges in Grand Bahama were 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m) above normal tide levels.\n\nLONG LISTS OF MISSING\n\nWith telephones down on Abaco and Grand Bahama islands, residents posted lists of missing loved ones across social media.\n\nAn aerial view shows devastation after hurricane Dorian hit the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas, September 3, 2019, in this image obtained via social media. Michelle Cove/Trans Island Airways/via REUTERS\n\nA single Facebook post by media outlet Our News Bahamas seeking the names of missing people had 1,600 comments listing lost family members since it went live on Tuesday morning.\n\nDorian packed sustained winds of 110 miles per hour (175 kph) and was moving northwest at 6 mph (9 kph), as it churned about 95 miles (155 km) east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, the NHC said in an 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT) advisory.\n\nForecasters said that one or two tornadoes were possible overnight on the Florida coast, and that risk would later shift to Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nHurricane-force winds had expanded to 60 miles (96 km) from the storm\u2019s core. \u201cDorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane during the next couple of days,\u201d the NHC said.\n\nThe exact toll in the Bahamas will not be clear until the storm completely passes and rescue crews can get to devastated areas, said Theo Neilly, the Bahamian consul general in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe expect it to be very devastating and the damage to be extreme,\u201d Neilly said. Dorian has battered the Bahamas for the past three days.\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said, in the strongest storm ever to hit the Bahamas.\n\nFood may be required for 14,500 people in the northern Bahamas\u2019 Abaco Islands and for 45,700 people in Grand Bahama, the U.N. World Food Programme said in a statement. The preliminary estimates were based on an assessment by representatives of Caribbean nations, the WFP and other groups.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development said on Twitter it was airlifting critical relief items, such as plastic sheeting, hygiene kits, and water containers, from Miami to the Bahamas. The U.S. Coast Guard said four of its helicopters were assisting in humanitarian efforts.\n\nDorian, which killed one person in Puerto Rico before striking the Bahamas on Sunday, is tied for the second-strongest Atlantic storm to make landfall with Gilbert (1988), Wilma (2005) and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane.\n\nIt was expected to hit Florida with hurricane conditions overnight, before bringing its powerful winds and dangerous surf along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina by late on Thursday.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\nThe governors of those states have ordered evacuations of coastal counties.\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for South Carolina on Tuesday, freeing funds, other federal resources and manpower to assist during the storm and aftermath recovery.\n\nEmergencies have already been declared in Florida and Georgia.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian smashed parts of the tourism-dependent Bahamas to ruins, leaving relief officials scrambling on Tuesday to battle an unfolding humanitarian crisis as the scale of the catastrophe begins to emerge.", "authors": ["Dante Carrer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425957182&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF83062"}
