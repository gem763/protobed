His 2014 Model S, meanwhile, was quickly running out of battery.\n\n\"The Tesla wasn't fully charged at the beginning of the shift,\" a Fremont police spokesperson told CBS San Francisco. \"This unfortunately happens from time to time even in our vehicles that run on gas, if they aren't refueled at the end of a shift.\"\n\nFremont police took delivery of the electric cruiser in March as part of a pilot program that already included a Toyota Prius and Ford Fusion Hybrid. While the car \"appears to meet patrol performance requirements\" and came with financial and environmental benefits (it's expected to save $50,000 in fuel charges over five years), the department warned of the one-hour charging time between shifts.\n\nPolice departments around the country have a long history with electric vehicles. As Quartz points out, the very first police car was an electric, 4-horsepower \"paddy wagon\" in Akron, Ohio, in 1899. But innovations to the internal combustion engine, and a need for speed, fueled a switch to gas-powered cruisers.\n\nDespite the battery-level struggles, Fremont police eventually located the suspect vehicle after it crashed into some bushes, the East Bay times reported.\n\n\"We are easily able to make it through an 11-hour shift with battery power to spare,\" a Fremont police captain told the news site, adding that there's usually 40-50% battery life remaining in the Tesla at the end of a shift.\n\nNow read:", "description": "The Fremont, California, police department said the vehicle wasn't fully charged at the beginning of the shift, as is the policy.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cc7352e22af5a4d57e0e5-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
