Meehan School of Business at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts. With the Fed\u2019s policy rate currently targeted at between 2% and 2.25%, the central bank has limited space to reduce rates before it hits its lower limit of 0%, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to use up that valuable space at a time where we actually think prices are pretty stable and the labor markets are pretty tight,\u201d he said.", "description": "Despite growing trade tensions and geopolitical concerns that could threaten the U.S. economy, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren on Tuesday stuck to his view that the U.S. central bank does not need to cut interest rates further.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
