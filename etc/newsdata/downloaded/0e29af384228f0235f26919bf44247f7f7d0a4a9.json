But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn't belong at Yale in the first place,\" the tweet read.\n\nNYT cultural reporter Robin Pogrebin appeared alongside her colleague Kate Kelly on \"The View,\" where she confirmed earlier reports that she herself wrote that tweet.\n\nNYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY GRILLED ON 'THE VIEW,' BLAME 'OVERSIGHT' BY EDITORS\n\n\u201cIt was a misworded tweet, but what happens at The Times is the reporters are asked to draft tweets and we\u2019re also asked to draft suggested headlines,\" Pogrebin said.\n\n\"They don\u2019t always get used, they don't always get sent out, they often don\u2019t. I drafted this with this in mind to have the opposite effect, which is to anticipate those who would say, \u2018A guy pulling down his pants at a party when they\u2019re drunk is on the spectrum of sexual misconduct. It\u2019s not sexual assault. It\u2019s not rape.
