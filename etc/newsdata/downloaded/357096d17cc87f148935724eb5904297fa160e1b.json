He had a different psyche'", "language": "en", "text": "CANBERRA, Australia \u2014 Ivan Milat, whose grisly serial killings of seven German, British and Australian backpackers horrified Australia in the early \u201890s, died in a Sydney prison on Sunday, ending hopes of a deathbed confession to more unsolved slayings. He was 74.\n\nThe road worker and gun enthusiast had been in custody since 1994 and was diagnosed in May with terminal esophageal and stomach cancer. Milat died in the medical wing of Long Bay Prison, New South Wales state Corrective Services said.\n\nHe was convicted of murder in the deaths of three German, two British, and two Australian backpackers after giving them rides while they were hitchhiking. The serial killings came to light when the mutilated corpses were found in a forest near Sydney over 14 months in 1992 and 1993.\n\nSpeculation has continued at Milat had an accomplice and had been responsible for other homicides and suspicious tourist disappearances.\n\nClive Small, a former detective who led the murder investigation, said on Sunday that he was confident Milat acted alone. But Small also suspects Milat had more victims, including three people whose bodies were found in other forests from as early as 1971.\n\n\u201cI had absolutely no respect for him at all. I thought that if he had one ounce of decency in him, he could have shown it before he died by admitting and clarifying a number of issues that are outstanding,\u201d Small said.\n\nThe case set off a frenzy of attention that consumed Australians like few others.\n\nPolice put a team of investigators on the case, a reward was offered and media intensely covered the hunt for the killer and the possibility of more victims.\n\nThe crimes also inspired the \u201cWolf Creek\u201d horror movies and television series released since 2005.\n\nIn September 1992, two runners orienteering in the Belanglo State Forest southwest of Sydney discovered a concealed corpse. Police unearthed a second body nearby, and dental records confirmed the victims were Britons Caroline Clarke, 21, and Joanne Walters, 22, who\u2019d been last seen in Sydney five months earlier.\n\nTwo more bodies were found in October 1993 by a man searching for firewood. Police identified them as Australian couple Deborah Everist and James Gibson, both 19, who\u2019d gone missing in late 1989.\n\nPolice searches of the forest revealed the body of German Simone Schmidl, 21, and later in November the corpses of German couple Anja Habschied, 20, and Gabor Neugebauer, 21, who\u2019d been missing since 1991.\n\nPolice established a 20-person team of detectives and analysts, posting a reward of $500,000 Australian dollars for information that would lead to the perpetrator. More than 300 police spent three months searching the forest.\n\nMilat was arrested on May 22, 1994, following two months of surveillance. Police were aided by a British man, Paul Onions, who had accepted a ride from him while hitchhiking out of Sydney in 1990 and managed to escape from the car, running down the road while Milat shot at him.\n\nSmall said Onions\u2019 identification enabled police to execute search warrants targeting Milat.\n\nA search of Milat\u2019s Sydney house found several weapons including parts of a rifle that matched one used in the killings, and the cameras of some of his victims. Milat had also given victims\u2019 property he had taken as souvenirs to family members.\n\nWhen his trial ended in 1996, Milat was found guilty of seven murders and sentenced to serve seven consecutive life sentences.\n\nSmall said of Milat\u2019s death: \u201cA lot of people are going to be very satisfied with the current outcome and will be pleased that it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nIan Clarke, the Northumberland-based father of British victim Caroline Clarke, said: \u201cNo matter how Christian one might be, you can\u2019t help but be glad that this has happened.\u201d\n\nCriminologist and author Amanda Howard corresponded with Milat almost monthly since 1997. She said Milat would never have made a deathbed confession.\n\n\u201cHe died in a very painful way, but he was happy that he was able to take these secrets to his grave,\u201d said Howard, who suspects Milat has more than seven victims. She said Milat had recently written to her that \u201che felt for the parents of the German backpackers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe goes: \u2018I can\u2019t imagine what they must be feeling knowing that this and this and this had happened to their children,\u201d\u2019 Howard said.\n\n\u201cBut he then went into the graphic detail, so he enjoyed being able to relive that and retell that story,\u201d she added.\n\nHe was moved to maximum security after an escape attempt in 1997.\n\nMilat continued to make headlines over the years through hunger strikes and self-harm, including severing a finger with a plastic knife.\n\nHe had undergone specialist palliative care at a Sydney hospital for more than two weeks before he was returned to prison on Tuesday last week.\n\nNew South Wales Minister for Counter Terrorism and Corrections Anthony Roberts said Milat had been sentenced to die in prison and authorities had ensured he did not end his days in a public hospital bed.\n\n\u201cHe showed no remorse. We ensured the sentence was carried out,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHe can rot in hell.\u201d\n\nMilat was born on Dec. 27, 1944, one of 12 children of a Croatian immigrant father and an Australian-born mother.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, an older brother summed up Milat\u2019s infamy.\n\n\u201cHe was going to kill somebody from the age of 10,\u201d Boris Milat said. \u201cIt was built into him. He had a different psyche. He\u2019s a psychopath, and it just manifested itself with, \u2018I can do anything, I can do anything.\u201d\u2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ivan Milat, whose grisly serial killings of seven German, British and Australian backpackers horrified Australia in the early '90s, died in a Sydney prison on Sunday, ending hopes of a deathbed confession to more unsolved slayings.
