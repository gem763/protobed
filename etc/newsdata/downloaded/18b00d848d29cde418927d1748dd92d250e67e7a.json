Not right away \u2014 for a year, Iran continued to abide by the nuclear agreement, apparently hoping that Europeans would rescue the pact. But then Iran began to gradually discard the nuclear-production restrictions, and to strike out, hitting tankers in the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz, a Saudi pipeline, an American drone. Then, two weeks ago, came the cruise-missile attack on key oil facilities inside Saudi Arabia. Iran has said it was not behind that attack, but there is little question that it would have to at least have permitted it, if not instigated it. From the American response to these escalations, Iran has learned that Mr. Trump is anxious not to back up his bullying language with force.\n\nAnd so the Trump administration has been left isolated and with no good options. Iran is back in the nuclear weapons business and more desperate than before as its economy crumbles under the sanctions. If the United States does respond militarily, Iran will most likely escalate further; if the United States does nothing, hard-liners in Iran will be emboldened to try new and more outrageous provocations while other global provocateurs \u2014 North Korea, Russia, China \u2014 watch and learn. America\u2019s allies, holding Mr. Trump responsible for the quandary, are in no mood to bail him out. And Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf states have been left wondering whether they can count on the Americans for support.\n\nIn short, Mr. Trump has boxed himself in. He may not want war, but he has helped raise tensions to such a level that a misstep or deliberate provocation by any one of a number of players in the region could drag the United States into one. To avoid things getting worse, the administration needs first to restore a modicum of credibility with its allies and the international community. That will become far more difficult in the rising tumult of impeachment proceedings, but a call on the United Nations Security Council to investigate the attack on Saudi oil fields, along with a full disclosure of whatever evidence the government has of Iran\u2019s involvement, would broaden the pressure on Tehran. As The Times\u2019s David E. Sanger and Farnaz Fassihi wrote this week, Iran is not finding the support it hoped for in Europe and could be susceptible to broad censure.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump should keep the door open to negotiations and to make clear to Iran that while further aggression will not go unanswered, resuming compliance with the 2015 agreement would be met with concrete benefits, like the $15 billion bailout package France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has proposed.", "description": "\u201cThe worst of times often create the best opportunities to make good deals.\u201d", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/opinion/27iransaudi/27iransaudi-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
