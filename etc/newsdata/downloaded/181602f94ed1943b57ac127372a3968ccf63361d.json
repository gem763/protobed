Instead it becomes a powerful, painful study of regret but not remorse. - Ian Freer, Empire Magazine While it clocks in at a lengthy 209 minutes, there's rarely a moment where The Irishman is burdened by this run-time, thanks to its incredible lead stars, masterful direction and poignant storyline. - Roxy Simons, MailOnline It would be unchivalrous to put a date on when De Niro was last this good. But he\u2019s sensational \u2013 giving a grippingly subtle, internalised performance that melts through the de-ageing process. - Robbie Collin, The Telegraph Nothing will sell you fully on Scorsese\u2019s biggest gamble, digitally de-aging his cast so that they can play their own thirtysomething characters - Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out\n\n'But the answer, it turns out, is rather up-to-the-minute. That running time is a mere blip in the world of binge-watching; if The Irishman weren\u2019t a movie at all but, in fact, a show (a limited series, say), we\u2019d be talking all of three episodes.'\n\nMeanwhile, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw claimed that the film was Scorsese's 'finest film for 30 years' as he said: 'No-one but Scorsese and this glorious cast could have made this movie live as richly and compellingly as it does, and persuade us that its tropes and images are still vital.\n\n'We have had ample opportunity to tire of the mob, the politicians, Florida, Cuba and so on. 'But Scorsese brings it back into a scalpel-sharp focus, especially with a new emphasis on Frank\u2019s spiritual devastation and guilt: a man who had long ago amputated his ability to feel remorse and now is unable to come to terms with his feelings. It is another massive achievement for Scorsese.'\n\nEmpire Magazine's Ian Freer claimed that while the film 'slightly loses its focus' in the middle, its central performances, direction and story helps make the film as powerful as it is.\n\n'The film is better when it sticks to the dynamics between the characters and it picks up superbly as the various conflicts come together,' he wrote.\n\n'But what lifts The Irishman head and shoulders above every other recent crime film is that it doesn\u2019t end when the bodies are buried and the gangsters are locked up. Instead it becomes a powerful, painful study of regret but not remorse.'\n\nHe went on to add: 'Scorsese delivers a stunning, gangster flick but The Irishman is so much more, a melancholy eulogy for growing old and losing your humanity.'\n\nStrong: Empire Magazine's Ian Freer claimed that while the film 'slightly loses its focus' in the middle, its central performances, direction and story helps make the film as powerful as it is\n\nThe Telegraph's Robbie Collin looked towards Scorsese's most recent filmography, as he wrote: 'As Scorsese late-career masterpieces go, The Irishman splits the difference between Silence and The Wolf of Wall Street: this is a weighty, contemplative work, but one that moves like lightning for its entire three-and-a-quarter hours plus credits, and sporadically shakes with darkly comic amusement.\n\n'It would be unchivalrous to put a date on when De Niro was last this good. But he\u2019s sensational \u2013 giving a grippingly subtle, internalised performance that melts through the de-ageing process as if it were no more than make-up.'\n\nMeanwhile, Time Out's Joshua Rothkopf gave the film four stars, as he was less convinced by the film's use of de-aging technology.\n\nHigh praise: The Telegraph 's Robbie Collin wrote: 'It would be unchivalrous to put a date on when De Niro was last this good. But he\u2019s sensational'\n\n'Nothing will sell you fully on Scorsese\u2019s biggest gamble, digitally de-aging his cast so that they can play their own thirtysomething characters,' he wrote.\n\n'Everyone looks unnaturally pinkish and puffy-faced, like 50-year-olds who have recently discovered hair dye.'\n\n'After a while, you adjust, or rather, you get tired of probing the slightly-off evidence of your eyes (and the headache it produces). There\u2019s a lot of fun to distract you.'\n\nThe Irishman is set to be released in cinemas on November 1 ahead of its launch on Netflix.", "description": "The Irishman received rave reviews from critics upon its premiere at the closing gala of the BFI London Film Festival on Sunday night.", "authors": ["Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19682832-0-image-a-13_1571042862783.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
