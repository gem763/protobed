But not the way Trump intends, and not necessarily to the detriment of Trump challenger Joe Biden.\n\nThe investigations and possible prosecutions, if they happen, would take place in the context of a new law signed by Zelensky just before his departure for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he is expected to meet face to face with Trump for the first time.\n\nIn Kyiv, there are widespread hopes that the reforms will help Zelensky, a former comedian who played a corruption fighting president on television, deliver on his campaign president to clean up Ukraine for real. A new team of independent prosecutors is supposed to re-open investigations of past cases and answer questions about the corruption in post-revolutionary Ukraine over the last five years.", "description": "", "authors": ["Anna Nemtsova", "Thedailybeast.Com Ukraine-Likely-To-Reopen-Probe-Of-Hunter-Biden-Firm-Sources"], "top_image": ""}
