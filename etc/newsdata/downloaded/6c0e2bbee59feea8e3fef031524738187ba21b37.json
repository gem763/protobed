(Photo by Jim Rogash/Getty Images)\n\nNFL teams have so, so much to be worried about when they face the New England Patriots. A collection of lethal weapon headlined by Josh Gordon. The league\u2019s top defense. A perennially strong offensive line. Some guy named Tom Brady.\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHowever, the Buffalo Bills have even more to fear.\n\nBills: Please don\u2019t throw a dildo onto the field\n\nThe Bills are scheduled to face the Patriots this Sunday, and many observers know what that means. Another dildo potentially thrown on New Era Field.\n\nOver the last three years, all three Patriots-Bills games in Buffalo have seen a dildo thrown onto the field. Once. Twice. Three times. A tradition unlike any other.\n\nWant to see a ref kick a dildo out of the end zone? pic.twitter.com/IkwTxp1ZbM \u2014 Nora Princiotti (@NoraPrinciotti) October 30, 2018\n\nYou can understand why the Bills are steeling themselves for a fourth time.\n\nThose worries resulted in some simply incredible quotes given to The Athletic about the looming embarrassment:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Patriots week,\u201d said Bills chief administrative officer Dave Wheat, \u201cand that we have to contemplate if some fan is going throw a dildo on the field is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe obvious, and fair, concern about the flying dildos is that there will be children in attendance \u2014 Bills tight end Lee Smith lamented that he will have four kids in the stands watching \u2014 but the Bills are apparently worried about the wellbeing of the players on the field too:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhat if Josh Allen is running, steps on it and tears his ACL?\u201d Wheat asked. \u201cWhat are the ramifications? What if Tom Brady got injured? \u201cThis community would never live that down. People need to realize these are professional athletes, and you\u2019re literally putting their health and safety at risk.\u201d\n\nSuch a possibility probably isn\u2019t likely, but you never know with the Bills Mafia.\n\nIf such a thing happens, you can at least bet on consequences for whomever throws the dildo if caught. Last year\u2019s dildo thrower was charged with disorderly conduct for his behavior and the Bills have banned other offenders for life in the past. However, for some, that might just be the cost of doing what\u2019s necessary.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "For the last three years, a dildo has been thrown onto the field at New Era Field in every Patriots-Bills game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7YTjnTw0Yeg_pCnrdhnEUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WBlMkOIEwl2mHXfx352m9w--~B/aD0yNjU1O3c9Mzk4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/28c8ede0-e218-11e9-907f-dff384ad399e", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
