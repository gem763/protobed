Cory Booker tried dancing his way through this thicket when challenged by CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett and Dana Bash after last night\u2019s debate. While most of the rest of the Democratic contenders clucked their tongues at Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s dig at Biden\u2019s memory, Booker tried to salvage Castro\u2019s attack:\n\nBOOKER: Look, I think we are at a tough point right now, because there are a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line, and without fumbling. And I think that Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, \u2018can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line,\u2019 and he has every right to call that out. I do think that tone and tenor is really important, and we can respect President Biden [sic] and disagree with him. I tried to show that in the CNN debate where he and I have strong different \u2014 disagreements. But we shouldn\u2019t do things that at the end of this \u2014 when you demonize somebody, create bad blood, it\u2019s hard to unify afterwards. \u2026 BOOKER: I think there was a lot of moments where a number of us were looking at us on stage when he tends to go on sometimes. At one point, he\u2019s talking about people in communities like mine listening to record players. I don\u2019t remember the last time I saw a record player in my community \u2014 BASH: They\u2019re back in, you know. BOOKER: They\u2019re back in \u2014 the vinyl is hot! BASH: It is hot, I just want to let you know. [crosstalk] BOOKER: Maybe he\u2019s cooler than I am, but there are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder. But, I don\u2019t know, look \u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think Booker\u2019s \u201cjust wonder[ing]\u201d about Biden\u2019s policy choices here. When Burnett asks him the sixty-four dollar question about Biden\u2019s age being a disqualifier, however, Booker backpedals \u2026 by saying Biden\u2019s always been a little incoherent:\n\nBURNETT: Senator, are you saying that he\u2019s just too old to be president? BOOKER: No, I\u2019m definitely not saying that, because I\u2019ve listened to Joe Biden over the years and often felt like there were times that he, ah, is going on or meandering in his speech. Look, I want someone who can excite and energize and call us to campaign like we saw back in \u201908 and \u201912 where we had record turnouts, and somebody who can speak to the fullness of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe record turnouts had a lot more to do with organization than rhetoric, a point both parties seem determined to ignore in yet another election cycle. Besides, if that\u2019s the criterion on which Booker makes his decision, why is he still in the race at all? Where are his crowds, his turnout, his own organization?\n\nBack to being respectful about age: Booker\u2019s right about Biden\u2019s meanderings being less about age and more about Biden\u2019s consistent style of campaigning and speaking. So why bring up age at all? Because, in all fairness, Booker\u2019s not the only person to \u201clisten to Joe Biden and just wonder.\u201d Bernie Sanders is older, but Biden\u2019s frailty is starting to poke out from the edges, especially in that moment where his eye filled up with blood in the middle of a sit-down live interview on CNN. Hardly any major media outlet even bothered to note it, including CNN. Booker should have challenged Burnett and Bash on that point \u2014 why not?\n\nMaybe it shouldn\u2019t be used as a gotcha as Castro did last night, but Biden\u2019s age and health is not an unfair issue. The better question is why the media has avoided it.", "description": "\"There are definitely moments you listen Joe Biden and just wonder ...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/booker-bash-burnett.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
