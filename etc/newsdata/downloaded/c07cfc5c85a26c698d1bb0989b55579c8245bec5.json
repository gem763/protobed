Google says it has achieved quantum supremacy, which means the quantum computer did something a conventional computer could never do.\n\nBut competitor IBM is disputing that Google achieved the benchmark, saying Google underestimated the conventional supercomputer.\n\nQuantum computing is an advanced computing technology that is still at a relatively early stage of development.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Google says it has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing research.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
