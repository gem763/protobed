It\u2019s a necessary return to America\u2019s traditional foreign policy. It\u2019s a rejection of the neoconservative doctrine, which has contributed to the broken state of affairs in the Middle East.\n\nNeoconservative alarmists will stop at nothing to sustain their paradigm of more wars in more places. Others, who originally rejected the Iraq war and subsequent intervention in Syria, now scold the president for leaving. Together they are empowering the failed status quo. Rejecting this status quo is essential for America\u2019s future.\n\nAfter 9/11, America had a clear cause for war in Afghanistan. Three days later, Congress authorized war against al-Qaeda. But that doesn\u2019t explain why we needed to get militarily involved in Iraq or Syria. At that point, neither country was directly connected to the targeted terrorist organization.\n\nFollowing the Cold War, a bipartisan consensus emerged with a view that America\u2019s security depended on spreading democracy around the globe by persuasion or by war. However, America\u2019s post-Vietnam aversion to endless wars stood in the way of this transformative consensus.\n\nThus, the coup de grace for neocons was the post-9/11 war in Iraq. To get the bombing started, they used Colin Powell to present it within the post-Vietnam framework\u2014a limited war with a limited objective: seize Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. Once on the ground in Iraq, the mission changed to an ill-defined and undeclared effort to create a democratic republic of Iraq. Unfortunately, when given a vote, the various factions in Iraq simply elected authoritarians, who continued their long tradition of conflict, which has dominated the Middle East\u2019s troubled history.\n\nThe United States cannot indefinitely be the guarantor of stability in the Middle East. American actions have ultimately empowered Iran, rather than checking its relentless efforts to destabilize the region. At some point, we must restore America\u2019s foreign policy to more limited objectives. President Trump bringing our troops home is an essential and important step in this process. It is an overdue rejection of the flawed consensus that has caused much of this present situation. A directive to exit should not lead to a disorderly evacuation, but should empower better alternatives.\n\nTo be sure, America\u2019s military makes even foolish missions look achievable. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines possess incredible skill, valor, creativity, resourcefulness, and compassion. I share the confidence that American saber-rattlers have in the ability of our military to solve problems. However, more wars in more places do not make America more secure. The neoconservative consensus has left America less free, less safe, and burdened by unprecedented debt.\n\nSo what becomes of the Kurds? NATO leaders must make clear to Turkey that committing genocide would mean losing its membership. The treaty group should take diplomatic, economic, and\u2014if required\u2014military action to prevent any NATO ally from engaging in genocide. This will force Turkey to choose its future. Does Turkey want a future with its longtime allies or does it desire a darker path towards Russia and Iran?\n\nIn the past, foreign policy hawks have sustained their consensus by labeling their opponents \u201cisolationists.\u201d Often it works. But as a former Army Ranger and West Point graduate, I know that if you want peace, you must prepare for war. Returning to America\u2019s traditional foreign policy is not isolationist.\n\nWe should take President Trump\u2019s more restrained foreign policy as a new beginning for American diplomacy. Perhaps Congress will even muster the resolve to openly debate and declare America\u2019s wars, rather than relying on an 18-year-old authorization for use of military force. In the meantime, America\u2019s military will rest, retool, and prepare for the future.\n\nCongressman Warren Davidson is a Republican representing Ohio\u2019s 8th District.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-sad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
