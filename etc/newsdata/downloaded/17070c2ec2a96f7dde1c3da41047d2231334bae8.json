The tests found the sound to be \u2018exceptionally poor\u2019 and the headphones failed to deliver promised noise cancelling.\n\nShortly after the consumer group reported its findings to Amazon, the product was made \u2018currently unavailable\u2019. Amazon also deleted customer reviews en masse.\n\nThe Onson cordless vacuum cleaner also showed signs of suspicious reviews, scoring an average of 4.4 alongside a coveted \u2018Amazon\u2019s Choice\u2019 recommendation.\n\nWhich? said there was an issue with sellers offering an incentive for fake positive reviews, often asking for a product photo or video upload in order to collect their reward. On this product, 40 per cent of reviews were accompanied by a picture or video, and all of these were five star.\n\nTests by Which? found it was one of the lowest-scoring cordless vacuum cleaners ever at just 32 per cent, which warranted a Don\u2019t Buy warning.\n\nIt was hard to use, unhygienic to empty and scored just one star for cleaning on carpets, floorboards and laminate flooring.\n\nThe consumer group said a sudden surge of positive reviews over a short period should be seen as a tell-tale sign they are unreliable.\n\nFake reviews are used routinely by unscrupulous online sellers to undermine honest small businesses legitimately using online marketplaces such as Amazon to reach new audiences\n\nFake reviews are used routinely by unscrupulous online sellers to undermine honest small businesses legitimately using online marketplaces to reach new audiences.\n\nWhich? says this is an important issue as online reviews influence about \u00a323billion of UK transactions a year, according to the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nWhich? head of home products and services Natalie Hitchins said: \u2018There appears to be no sense of urgency from the industry to tackle this problem so it\u2019s down to the regulator.\u2019\n\nAmazon said: \u2018In the last year alone, we\u2019ve spent over $400million to protect customers from reviews abuse.\n\n\u2018Last year, we prevented more than 13 million attempts to leave an inauthentic review and we took action against more than five million bad actor accounts attempting to manipulate reviews.\u2019\n\nThe CMA said: \u2018We\u2019re already cracking down on fake reviews and have recently urged Facebook and eBay to act to stop the sale of fake reviews through their sites. As part of our ongoing work, we are planning to examine the role of websites where people post reviews.\u2019", "description": "Consumer champions Which! tested a number of items which received positive ratings and found despite the high score, many of the products were of poor quality.", "authors": ["Sean Poulter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20053672-0-image-a-24_1571786875948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
