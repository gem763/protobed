First, Johnson somehow lands a deal with the EU this week, somehow gets his parliament to support it on Saturday - both of which look like tall orders - and Britain leaves the EU on October 31 with a transition deal.\n\nBusinesses, particularly exporters and importers, would then go on pretty much as usual for the time being - although the country and its biggest trading partner would move into a new, and equally uncertain, phase of negotiations over an end-state free-trade agreement.\n\nBrush with death.. PM Boris Johnson's 'do or die' Oct. 31 Brexit looks unlikely to get done. Getty\n\nSecond, Johnson somehow lands a deal with the EU this week but parliament doesn't support it on Saturday. Brexit will have to be delayed, and either Johnson will get the election he craves, or else parliament will vote to put his deal to a referendum.\n\nIf it's an election, Johnson could get a majority. He'll then resubmit his Brexit deal to the EU and parliament, and Britain will probably leave on those terms on January 31. If it's another hung parliament, though, almost anything could happen - but a referendum might be the only way out of the impasse.\n\nIf it's a referendum, right now you'd back Johnson to win it. Labour will probably be split, and the Leave team that won the day in the 2016 referendum is basically still together, but with the full power of Downing Street and the government's resources behind it.\n\nThird, Johnson doesn't secure a deal with the EU this week. If they're nearly there, he'll ask for a delay and probably try to get Brexit done before an election.\n\nIf they're nowhere near a deal, he'll want to fight an election as soon as he can, blaming the Europeans and parliament for frustrating the will of the people.\n\nThe question is whether parliament will grant him an election. Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will, but the political calculus could change considerably between now and Saturday.\n\nSo by next Sunday, Britain will either be cruising towards a smooth Brexit; tweaking the details of an agreed Brexit deal; gearing up for a November election; or collapsed into infighting over an imminent referendum.\n\nBut, after nearly two years of going round and round in circles, at least there will be some kind of sense, however limited, of moving forward. Even if nothing else is resolved, that alone will be quite something.", "description": "Will it be snap (an election), crackle (a divisive referendum), or pop (a surprise Brexit deal)?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3036717dcb33f3dc0f720ed7c07ac0d131dc0bb4", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
