Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, announced on Tuesday that an intelligence community whistleblower who allegedly has information about President Donald Trump\u2019s misconduct in office would like to speak to the committee and has asked the acting director of national intelligence how to do so.\n\nIn a tweet posted Tuesday, Schiff said the Intelligence Committee is in contact with the whistleblower\u2019s counsel and looks forward to the individual\u2019s testimony.\n\nWe have been informed by the whistleblower\u2019s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so.\n\n\n\nWe\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week. \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2019\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint stems from initial allegations that Trump urged the president of Ukraine to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent, for political purposes.\n\nIntelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson assessed the whistleblower complaint as a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d and relayed it to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who is required by law to share the complaint with Congress within seven days of receipt. But Maguire has so far refused to share the complaint, claiming it contains privileged and confidential information.\n\nMaguire has been called to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 26.", "description": "The chair of the House Intelligence Committee says the whistleblower's counsel has been in contact with committee staff.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a646a23000059006da624.jpeg?cache=sen5vamyeb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
