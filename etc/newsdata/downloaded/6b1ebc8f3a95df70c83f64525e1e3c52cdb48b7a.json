Well, I have news for Mr. Joker. He may think life is tragicomic, but the movie he\u2019s in is very much a drama\u2014a pompous, grim, relentlessly one-note adaptation bent on proving just how far removed it is from its comic-book heritage.\n\nJoker, fresh off a victory at this year\u2019s Venice Film Festival, is arriving in cinemas on a sea of hype and controversy. Its depiction of a troubled antihero driven to mass murder is generating so much concern that its own studio had to issue a statement clarifying that the film is not \u201can endorsement of real-world violence of any kind.\u201d Plenty of external factors contributed to that clarification, and the film itself is clearly not intended to function as a depraved call to arms for the world\u2019s villainous clowns. It is, however, a project drowning in self-seriousness. In his effort to bring realism to the Joker story, Phillips has lost his grasp on the character\u2019s symbolic purpose, treating the audience to something undeniably visceral but also unacceptably shallow.", "description": "Howell Raines, \u201cMy Times\u201d; William Langewiesche, \u201cA Sea Story\u201d; Paul Maslin, \u201cThe Front-Runner's Fall\u201d; Scott Stossel, \u201cKnifed\u201d; Christopher Hitchens, \u201cPoor Old Willie\u201d; Joshua Green, \u201cFunny Business\u201d; Ryan Lizza, \u201cKerry's Consigliere\u201d; Corby Kummer, \u201cGoing With the Grain\u201d; fiction by Aryn Kyle; and much more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mag/2004/05/cover/original.jpg"}
