Hoard turned pro after averaging 13.1 points and 7.6 rebounds during his lone college season, went undrafted and signed a two-way contract with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nThe unquestioned leader of this year\u2019s team is guard Brandon Childress, the son of former star guard Randolph Childress who averaged a team-best 14.7 points as the only player to start every game of last season.\n\nThe only current player to appear in an NCAA Tournament game with Wake Forest, Childress was a freshman on the John Collins-led team that lost in the First Four in 2017.\n\n\u201cJust understanding that this is my last year \u2026 just knowing what\u2019s at stake, just understanding and taking my time and just embracing all the little things that\u2019s going on now because I won\u2019t get this next year,\u201d Childress said.\n\nMANNING\u2019S FUTURE\n\nManning was brought back for a sixth year after his first five included three 20-loss seasons and only one NCAA Tournament berth. The decision to retain Manning was made by athletic director Ron Wellman shortly before he retired last spring, with an expectation of improvement this year.\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK\n\nJunior guard Chaundee Brown (11.9 ppg) was the team\u2019s only other double-figure scorer a year ago. Big man Olivier Sarr (5.5 rpg) is its top returning rebounder, and Sharone Wright Jr. and Isaiah Mucius showed promise last season while Torry Johnson is back for a second season as a graduate transfer from Northern Arizona.\n\nWHO\u2019S NEW\n\nWake Forest hopes transfer Andrien White can provide some instant offense from the perimeter. White, who sat out last season after transferring from Charlotte, is unafraid to put it up from 3-point range - more than 55% of his shot attempts came from beyond the arc. His career 37.9% shooting percentage from long range is better than any scholarship player on the team last year. \u201cI\u2019m prepared. I feel as prepared as I\u2019ve ever been in my career, and I\u2019m ready to come out and make an impact for this school and this university,\u201d White said.\n\nTHE SCHEDULE\n\nThe ACC\u2019s switch to a 20-game schedule means the Demon Deacons - who open Nov. 6 at Boston College - don\u2019t have the luxury of easing into things. Wake Forest will play Duke and North Carolina - the top two teams in the league\u2019s preseason poll - twice, along with Notre Dame, Clemson and BC. The key nonconference games are a visit to Penn State as part of the Big Ten/ACC Challenge and a home game against Xavier in the Skip Prosser Classic.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/MarchMadness and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At least this Wake Forest team has something its predecessors have lacked - experience.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joedy Mccreary"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/acc_media_day_basketball_72161_c0-204-4905-3065_s1200x700.jpg?7d052ef12c65f85125dc1de8e8767c38c415061e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
