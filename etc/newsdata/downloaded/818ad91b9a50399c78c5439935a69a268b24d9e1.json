Asked why he wanted the meeting to take place in private, Singh said he wanted to ensure the conversation is sincere.\n\n\"I don't want the conversation that I have with Mr. Trudeau to be used as a tool in his exoneration, or to be used as a way for him to say, 'I've had a conversation with a racialized leader and now I've done my job,'\" he said.\n\nTrudeau has been in damage control mode since Wednesday evening, when pictures of him in blackface were published by an American magazine.\n\nTime Magazine first reported that Trudeau had darkened his skin with makeup and dressed in a turban with long flowing robes when he attended an Arabian Nights-themed gala in 2001 at West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver, B.C., where he used to work.\n\nTrudeau held an emergency press conference on his campaign plane Wednesday evening.

Singh was taking reporters' questions in Windsor, Ont. Friday. 0:24\n\n\"There are a lot of people right now who are seeing the prime minister of this country mocking their reality, mocking their lived experience, and it's going to bring up a lot of pain for a lot of folks that's going to remind them of the insults they've heard their whole life,\" Singh told host Chris Hall.\n\n\"It's going to remind them of the physical violence they may have suffered, the barriers, and it's really those Canadians that need to be at the heart of anything that happens.\"\n\nTrudeau said that he is onside with Singh in the NDP leader's efforts to combat Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, racism and intolerance and is looking forward to speaking with him personally.\n\n\"I will be apologizing to him personally as a racialized Canadian, as I have been apologizing to Canadians who have suffered discrimination and intolerance their entire lives in ways that some of us, like me, have never had to experience on a daily basis,\" Trudeau said.", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said today he'd be\u00a0happy to meet with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to discuss racism in the wake of the prime minister's blackface revelations \u2014 provided the meeting happens in private and is not used for political purposes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4817722.1536609254!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trudeau-singh.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
