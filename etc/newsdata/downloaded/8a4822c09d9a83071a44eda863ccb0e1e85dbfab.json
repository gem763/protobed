Amy Klobuchar slammed Juli\u00e1n Castro in a post-debate interview Thursday night, saying the former HUD secretary\u2019s attack on Joe Biden\u2019s memory was unnecessarily personal.\n\nMr. Castro had received a smattering of groans from the audience after he questioned whether the former vice president was struggling with his memory.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Mr. Castro asked Mr. Biden during the controversial exchange.\n\nMs. Klobuchar later told CNN what she thought in that moment.\n\n\u201cUgh, I just thought, \u2018This is not cool,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cJust because I think you can have policy differences, and I was one of the few ones up there that was willing to take on Bernie and some of these things even though we work together all the time, but I would never do it personally.\n\n\u201cI thought that was so personal and so unnecessary, when in fact we\u2019ve got to unite,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this in 2018, that\u2019s how we took back the House. We united behind candidates, and we didn\u2019t treat each other like Donald Trump. And one of the things that\u2019s really bothered me is how he has coarsened the rhetoric.\n\n\u201cI believe we don\u2019t just have to change policies, we have to change the tone in our politics,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when a statement like that is made, it doesn\u2019t feel like that. It feels like something Donald Trump might tweet out.\u201d\n\nMr. Castro, a former Housing and Urban Development secretary, said after the debate that he wasn\u2019t taking a shot at Mr. Biden\u2019s age, but his health care policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an attack on Vice President Biden,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s not something about personality. It\u2019s about the health care policy. That was my focus.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
