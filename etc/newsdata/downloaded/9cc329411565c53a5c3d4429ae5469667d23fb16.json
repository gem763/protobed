It was effective but, by the end of his spell in charge, Juve had become a somewhat unsatisfying team to watch.\n\nMaurizio Sarri, who replaced Allegri after the end of last season, has taken a different approach as he explained after Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win over Bologna which kept the Turin side top of the league standings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to administer the matches, I want to liquidate them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI told the lads that we mustn\u2019t try to control a game, sit on a lead or be comfortable because otherwise we leave ourselves in these risky situations to the very end. We have to keep attacking until the result is assured.\u201d\n\nLeipzig\u2019s early promise fades\n\nRB Leipzig looked primed to join Borussia Dortmund as Bayern\u2019s main challengers this season after winning five of their first six games but they have since gone off the boil, picking up two points in their last three league outings.\n\nAfter grabbing a late equaliser in their previous game at Bayer Leverkusen, this time Leipzig conceded in the latter stages of the game to draw 1-1 with Wolfsburg, missing out on the chance to go top.", "description": "There were a number of eye-catching results around Europe this weekend, ahead of the return of the Champions League.
