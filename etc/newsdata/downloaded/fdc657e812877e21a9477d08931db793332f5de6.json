It's just the natural cyclical rate of any industry. And it will be good because it will separate some of the wheat from the chaff. We have too many AR makers right now,\" he said.\n\nColt's Manufacturing Co. LLC acknowledged the \"significant excess in manufacturing\" in the \"sporting rifle\" market in a Sept. 19 statement explaining its suspension of civilian AR production. The company gave no indication that its decision might be tied to the current debate over the public's access to AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles, which have been used in several mass shootings, as some have inferred.\n\nOn the same day, the Defense Department announced that US Army Contracting Command had awarded a $41.9 million foreign military sales contract to Colt to produce M4 and M4A1 carbines for more than a dozen countries, including Afghanistan, Djibouti, Jordan, Kuwait and Lebanon.\n\n\"We are fortunate enough to have been awarded significant military and law enforcement contracts,\" Dennis Veilleux, president and CEO of Colt, said in the statement. \"Currently, these high-volume contracts are absorbing all of Colt's manufacturing capacity for rifles.\"\n\nMilitary.com reached out to Colt, but did not receive a response by press time.\n\nA US soldier during weapons qualification on the M16 at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, May 13, 2019. US Army/Michael Mascari\n\nColt became an icon of the AR-15/M16 family shortly after Eugene Stoner invented the AR-15 design for ArmaLite Company in the late 1950s. Colt purchased the design rights and produced mass quantities of the M16 during the Vietnam War.\n\nOver the years, it has supplied the US military with multiple versions of the M16, including the M4 and M4A1 up until 2013 when FN Manufacturing outbid Remington Arms Company and Colt Defense LLC to win a contract worth just under $77 million to make M4A1s for the Army.\n\nColt has also struggled on the civilian side of the AR market over the past 10 years, Cleckner said.\n\n\"It was rare in the past decade to go into a gun shop to see more than a couple of Colts,\" he said, adding that \"it was a great business decision\" for the Hartford, Connecticut-based company to focus on its military contracts, an option smaller gun shops have not had.\n\n\"We have had a bunch of smaller shops that have already shut down,\" Cleckner said. \"The only reason the big manufacturers have stayed around is they are so big, and they will be able to weather the storm.\"\n\nDespite the decrease in demand, the AR-15 is still an extremely popular rifle, Oliva said.\n\n\"It's still a very competitive market; we are looking at 16 million AR-15s that are in private ownership today in America,\" he said. \"I think this is a decision that [Colt officials] are making that is probably temporary, and I think that you [will] see them, when the time is right, re-emerge into the market.\"\n\n\u2014 Matthew Cox can be reached at matthew.cox@military.com.", "description": "Colt's decision shook the small-arms industry, but current market dynamics mean other gunmakers are likely to follow suit.", "authors": ["Matthew Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a8ede4f391d941a008b47c5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
