REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nTop-brand department stores in the Causeway Bay shopping district and the Central business area to the west closed their shutters in case of a return to the mob violence of past weekends.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still going to Central as that was the original plan,\u201d said one woman, who only gave her name as Kitkat, after a mass rally in Causeway Bay failed to get police permission.\n\n\u201cIf anyone asks, we are window shopping, not marching.\u201d\n\nSome protesters tore down and set fire to a red banner proclaiming the 70th anniversary on Oct. 1 of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, a date by which China will be eager for the protests to be over.\n\nSome others were digging up pathway bricks under the cover of umbrellas. In previous clashes bricks have been thrown at police.\n\nThe Chinese-ruled territory has been rocked by more than three months of sometimes violent unrest, with demonstrators angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984, lays out Hong Kong\u2019s future after its return to China in 1997, a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\n\u201cSino-British Joint Declaration is VOID,\u201d one placard read in the protest outside the British Consulate.\n\n\u201cSOS Hong Kong,\u201d read another.\n\n\u201cOne country, two systems is dead,\u201d protesters shouted in English under umbrellas shielding them from the sub-tropical sun, some carrying the colonial flag also bearing the Union Jack. \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSome broke into a refrain of \u201cRule Britannia\u201d.\n\nThe protesters handed in a petition and drifted away as thousands of others were in a separate protest, heading in their direction, along the artery of Hennessy Road where the \u201cding ding\u201d trams have run for more than 100 years.\n\nGas masks were being handed out, also under the cover of umbrellas, in case of tear gas, but many protesters showed their faces and most only wore surgical masks.\n\nDEMANDING RIGHTS\n\nViolence has broken out on previous weekends with protesters trashing metro stations and setting fires in the streets. The police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nMany protesters at the British Consulate held flyers calling for \u201cequal rights\u201d for their British National (Overseas) passports.\n\nWith many young people looking for routes out of Hong Kong, campaigners say Britain should change the status of the British National (Overseas) passport, a category created, on certain conditions, for after Britain returned Hong Kong to China.\n\nThe passports let a holder visit Britain for six months, but do not come with an automatic right to live or work there.\n\n\u201cI am here to demand the UK protect our citizens\u2019 rights in Hong Kong and speak up for Hong Kong under the Joint Declaration,\u201d Jacky Tsang, 25, told Reuters.\n\nThe spark for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.\n\nThe protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\n\u2018LEGALLY BINDING\u2019\n\nChina says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement, denies meddling and says the city is an internal Chinese issue. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by the 1984 declaration.\n\nHong Kong island was granted to Britain \u201cin perpetuity\u201d in 1842 at the end of the First Opium War. Kowloon, a peninsula on the mainland opposite Hong Kong island, joined later, after the Second Opium War.\n\nThe colony was expanded to include the New Territories, to the north of Kowloon, on a 99-year lease, in 1898.\n\nBritain returned all of the territory to China, which never recognized the \u201cunequal treaties\u201d, in 1997.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\n\u201cThe Joint Declaration is a legally binding treaty between the UK and China that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago,\u201d a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in June.\n\n\u201cAs a co-signatory, the UK government will continue to defend our position.\u201d\n\nBut it was not immediately clear what Britain could or would want to do to defend that position. It is pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with China, which since 1997 has risen to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after it leaves the European Union at the end of next month.", "description": "Thousands of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters marched under a sea of umbrellas on Sunday after hundreds had sung \"God Save the Queen\" outside the British Consulate demanding that the former colonial power ensures China honors the city's freedoms.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430050197&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E05R", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
