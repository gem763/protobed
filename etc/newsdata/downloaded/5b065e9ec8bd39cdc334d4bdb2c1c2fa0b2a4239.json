This eye-catching match-up feels all the more poignant because their last meeting of real significance, a lung-bursting five-setter in the last four of the 2017 French Open, was also the final match that Murray played before the ticking time bomb in his right hip exploded.\n\n\u201cI feel good,\u201d Murray said on Saturday in his on-court interview. \u201cIt has been a long road to get back to this point. I certainly didn\u2019t expect to get here so soon after I started playing again, so it\u2019s a big surprise for me.\u201d\n\nTo reach his first final since Dubai in March 2017, Murray had to sneak past a skinny French 21-year-old named Ugo Humbert. This did not seem all that challenging on paper, for Humbert is ranked No 70 in the world and was \u00adalready equalling his own record by reaching the semi-final of an ATP event. But he proved to be surprisingly dangerous, launching whiplash winners with a devil-may-care demeanour.", "description": "Looking down the draw sheet before the European Open in Antwerp, a floating sports fan might have shrugged at a bunch of unfamiliar names, but pointed out two former grand-slam champions:", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213322196-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
