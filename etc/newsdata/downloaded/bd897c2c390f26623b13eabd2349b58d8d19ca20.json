As the title of the hour-long ABC special The Douglas Dynasty suggests, the young Douglas attributes much of his decades-long battle with addiction to the pressures of carrying on one of Hollywood\u2019s most famous dynasties.\n\nHis grandfather, Kirk Douglas, is best known for playing Spartacus, but he starred in a staggering 87 films throughout his prolific career. Kirk, now 102, passed the baton to his son Michael, who has racked up his fair share of Emmys, Golden Globes, and Academy Awards as an actor and producer. In the Douglas family, show business was an inescapable birthright\u2014or so it felt to Cameron.\n\nCameron told Sawyer about the \u201chopeless admiration\u201d he felt for father and grandfather as a boy, seeing them blown up on billboards to epic, superhuman proportions. Attempting to carve out an identity for himself and feeling like he was coming up short, he turned to drugs at the young age of 13 while attending boarding school. At first it was marijuana, he said, to alleviate the feeling of pressure. Marijuana quickly escalated to cocaine, then crystal meth and heroin. He would enter 11 rehab facilities before reaching his mid-twenties. His father allegedly called him \u201cKing of the Shitheads\u201d when he was kicked out of boarding school and began hanging out with a group of drugged-out kids who called themselves the \u201cSewer Rats.\u201d\n\nAs Cameron details in his gritty upcoming memoir Long Way Home, he was shooting up liquid cocaine two to three times an hour at his lowest point. When the veins in his arms and legs collapsed, he would inject the drugs into his rib cage and even his neck. The cocaine would trigger bouts of extreme paranoia that drove him to hide in his closet for days at a time. It was then that his father called to say that he loved him, but he could not be emotionally invested any longer. He feared that his son was going to die.\n\nCameron Douglas did not die, but he did serve seven years behind bars, two of which were in solitary confinement. In a cruel ironic twist, when he was booked for possession of half a pound of methamphetamine, he was wearing a T-shirt in his mugshot bearing the phrase, \u201cYes, it\u2019s really me.\u201d\n\nMaking good on the promise of the title, Michael Douglas\u2019s explanation for why he failed to offer Cameron the support he needed traces back to the weight of the Douglas legacy. \u201cI should have focused more on my family,\u201d Michael Douglas told Sawyer, \u201cbut that\u2019s hard to say when you\u2019re in a career where you\u2019re stepping out of your father\u2019s shadow trying to have a life of your own.\u201d\n\nWhen we first see Cameron and his father onscreen together, they are silently listening to the song \u201cOld Man\u201d by Neil Young. And again, the Douglas men would be barely distinguishable from one another if you were to squint, with the same vast expanse of forehead, same narrow, crooked nose, even the same wrinkles around their mouths, adding an extra dose of poignancy to their joint interview time. It would all feel a bit too on-the-nose, if their identical sets of eyes\u2014watery and rimmed with pink\u2014were not strained by such sincere pain. Cameron recalls listening to Neil Young\u2019s raw, controlled wail of a voice when he was at his worst. \u201cI think, more than anything, I wanted to believe those lyrics,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a moving conclusion to the interview, Sawyer prompts Cameron to ask his father the one final question to which he has always wanted to know the answer. \u201cI guess I want to know if you truly thought I wasn\u2019t going to make it out,\u201d he began, \u201cor if you held onto some hope that I was going to be able to pull through?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, hope, yes, but if you are asking me\u2026\u201d the elder Douglas trailed off. \u201cWell, we always had hope, but no, I did not think you were going to make it.\u201d\n\nCameron was released from prison in 2016 and has been clean for five years.", "description": "The ABC special \u201cThe Douglas Dynasty\u201d featured many heartbreaking moments between the Oscar-winning actor and his demons-battling son.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571810300/GettyImages-983927246_rclzgn", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
