The case is currently set to open Thursday.\n\n\u201cMore than 200 years ago our founders sought to escape an oppressive, tyrannical governance in which absolute power vested with a monarch. A fear of the recurrence of tyranny birthed our three-branch government adorned with checks and balances,\u201d Gonzalez wrote in her ruling. \u201cNo government official, including the Executive, is above the law.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers could ask the judge to delay the trial or file an appeal to try to block the order for the president\u2019s testimony. There\u2019s also the chance of an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court or that Trump might simply ignore the judge\u2019s order and see what sanctions she imposes.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys could seek to appeal or stay the ruling, but their chances in New York state courts appear slim.\n\nPersuading judges to delay the trial further at this point could be difficult. The suit was filed more than four years ago and the trial has been put off repeatedly, including after one of the five plaintiffs died in February.\n\nTrump is named personally as a defendant in the suit, along with the Trump Campaign, the Trump Organization and Keith Schiller, who served Trump for years as a security guard and later as Director of Oval Office Operations at the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to avoid testifying in the case have collided with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1997 ruling requiring President Bill Clinton to submit to a deposition in a federal lawsuit brought by a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Jones, who accused Clinton of sexual harassment while he was governor of the state. The unanimous opinion said there is no immunity for a president sued over events taking place before he entered office.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have seized on one issue left open in the Clinton v. Jones case: whether a state court has the same power over a president that a federal court does. Trump\u2019s legal team has argued that a state judge might not be as deferential as a federal court judge would to the need to accommodate a president\u2019s schedule and important national security duties.\n\nGonzalez\u2019s order Friday and its suggestion that Trump submit to a deposition within days could reinforce that perception.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s legal team seems to have little prospect of victory in New York state courts in light of an appeals panel\u2019s ruling in March of this year rejecting Trump\u2019s bid to halt a defamation lawsuit brought by former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos.\n\nGonzales said that decision foreclosed Trump\u2019s arguments for immunity in the protesters\u2019 suit.\n\nTrump has also been ordered to give a pretrial deposition in the Zervos suit. However, the deadline has been extended to Oct. 31.\n\nTrump lawyers did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Gonzalez\u2019s ruling or what next steps they plan in the case. A White House spokesman declined to comment.\n\nA lawyer for the protesters, Roger Friedman, welcomed Gonzalez\u2019s decision. \u201cThe judge\u2019s ruling was clearly correct. President Trump\u2019s testimony will be highly relevant to the trial,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nCORRECTION: Doris Gonzalez\u2018s name appeared incorrectly in an earlier version of this article.", "description": "A judge in New York has required testimony from President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
