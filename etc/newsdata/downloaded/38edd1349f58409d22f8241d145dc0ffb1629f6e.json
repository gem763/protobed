I found a dolphin outfit, procured some fake blood and made a sign that read \u2018SeaWorld Sucks\u2019.\n\nI was a little concerned that a \u2018dead dolphin\u2019 might cause some controversy, especially in a busy nightclub, but my statement costume was a big hit.\n\nThrough documentaries like Blackfish and The Cove, I\u2019d learned about the appalling abuse of dolphins and whales for marine \u2018abusement\u2019 parks like SeaWorld \u2013 dolphins left traumatised when hunters wrench them out of their ocean homes and orcas dying decades short of their natural life expectancy.\n\nI was so sickened, I knew I had to do something to get the word out to others.\n\nAll through the night at the club, people approached me \u2013 some to tell me that they\u2019d seen Blackfish too. Others came up to ask what was wrong with SeaWorld: did animals actually die at those parks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many, activism is part of day-to-day life. The rise in activist activity over the past few years is undeniable: from climate strike action like Extinction Rebellion to the #MeToo movement and the 350 per cent rise in vegan eating, people are taking a stance to try to save our planet and improve the future of its inhabitants.\n\nFor others, Halloween is the one night when they\u2019re not afraid to make a bold statement.\n\nCovering yourself with fake blood, wrapping yourself in cling film and adding a fake meat label will remind others that meat isn\u2019t \u2018made\u2019 in supermarkets.\n\nSpeak up, whether it\u2019s a quiet conversation or shouting from a hilltop.\n\nA wool-free jumper, headband with \u2018lamb ears\u2019 and a smearing of fake blood will draw attention to incidents of cruel treatment of sheep by UK wool industry workers. Just like humans, sheep visibly express emotions and can recognise different facial expressions in people.\n\nThe billions of animals suffering in laboratories, on factory farms, in abattoirs and in other desperate situations need every single person who cares to take action. With one costume, you can speak up for them.\n\nOne of the best things about Halloween is that no one is afraid to ask who or what you\u2019re dressed as so it\u2019s a real opportunity to give a voice to campaigners and activists that at risk of being forgotten by history.\n\nMary Gawthorpe was pivotal to the Suffragette movement yet not everyone knows her name and few people know what she looks like. Use people\u2019s lack of knowledge to your advantage: this conversation-starter could be the ideal moment to inform someone about women\u2019s rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re a passionate environmentalist, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s not just what you dress up as but how. A lot of costumes are made from synthetic materials that are not biodegradable and added extras, like glitter, have been highlighted as being toxic for the environment. Looking for sustainable materials or recycling items is an act of environmentalism in itself.\n\nOf course, if costumes aren\u2019t your thing, there are more subtle ways of getting involved in activism.\n\nBe active on social media, set up an information table, hand out flyers or join a local protest. Hold a vegan dinner party and get that conversation going.\n\nTake every opportunity \u2013 not just on Halloween but every day of the year \u2013 to inform people and help them make kinder choices. Speak up, whether it\u2019s a quiet conversation or shouting from a hilltop.\n\nThis year, I\u2019ve chosen to dress as an \u2018evil\u2019 scientist \u2013 bloody lab coat, \u2018sad\u2019 rabbit toy, conical flask of \u2018poison\u2019 \u2013 to highlight the plight of animals subjected to cruel experiments at the hands of experimenters.\n\nAll around the world, hundreds of thousands of people care deeply about the very same issue you\u2019re fighting for \u2013 and we\u2019ve all seen the impact we can have when we act together. We shouldn\u2019t disregard how powerful our own individual actions can be, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever your social justice cause, I believe it\u2019s time to put the tired skeleton onesie away and kick your social conscience into gear this Halloween.\n\nMORE: PETA demands removal of Brooke Houts\u2019 YouTube channel after \u2018dog abuse\u2019 video as RSPCA responds\n\nMORE: PETA really wants you to go vegan for penis-related reasons\n\nMORE: You\u2019ll soon be able to ice-skate with real penguins in London, and PETA isn\u2019t happy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Jennifer White of PETA on how to make a political statement with your Halloween costume.", "authors": ["Jennifer White", "Senior Media Officer At People For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals", "Peta"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dolphin-Halloween-Costume-4f15_1572446944.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
