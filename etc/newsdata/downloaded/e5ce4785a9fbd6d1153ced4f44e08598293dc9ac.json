I don't think our farmers can produce that much \u2014 I said, that's okay,' Trump said.\n\nAt a rally in Louisiana on Friday night, Trump bragged that the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China could see U.S. agricultural imports soar\n\n'You know my people said 'Sir, could we make it 20 instead?' No, make it 50! Our farmers will buy more land and they'll buy bigger tractors by now,' Trump said.\n\n'I said I'm not stopping at 20. I want them to come back and say, sir, we can't do it because I love my farmers, but they're going to be out there busy,' he continued.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that China's agricultural purchases could scale up to $40 billion-$50 billion annually as part of a partial trade deal.\n\nFarmers cheered the announcement but warned they needed to see a follow-through of actual purchases.\n\n'I'm excited,' said Monte Peterson, a farmer in Valley City, North Dakota, of the first phase of a trade deal. 'That's a pretty good announcement for U.S. ag.'\n\nIt will be important for China to actually take delivery of U.S. farm products and not just announce purchases, however, Peterson said.\n\n'We have to see it through,' he said. 'We have to see it loaded and shipped out.'\n\nFarmers, who relied on China as the top buyer for U.S. soybeans and sorghum and a key market for pork and dairy, have seen their incomes plummet during the 15-month conflict of tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two largest economies.\n\nTrump on Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed.\n\nThe emerging deal, covering agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections, would represent the biggest step by the two countries in 15 months to end a tariff tit-for-tat that has whipsawed financial markets and slowed global growth.\n\nBut Friday's announcement did not include many details and Trump said it could take up to five weeks to get a pact written.\n\nHe acknowledged the agreement could fall apart during that period, though he expressed confidence that it would not.\n\n'I think we have a fundamental understanding on the key issues. We've gone through a significant amount of paper, but there is more work to do,' U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said as the two sides gathered with Trump at the White House. 'We will not sign an agreement unless we get and can tell the president that this is on paper.'\n\nWith Chinese Vice Premier Liu He sitting across a desk from him in the Oval Office after two days of talks between negotiators, the president told reporters that the two sides were very close to ending their trade dispute.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He presents U.S. President Donald Trump with a letter from Chinese President Xi Jinping after Trump announced a \"phase one\" trade agreement with China\n\n'There was a lot of friction between the United States and China, and now it\u00b4s a lovefest. That\u00b4s a good thing,' he said.\n\nLiu took a different tone in his remarks, however.\n\n'We have made substantial progress in many fields. We are happy about it. We'll continue to make efforts,' Liu said.\n\nChina's official state-owned news organization Xinhua said that both sides 'agreed to make the efforts towards a final agreement.'\n\nIn an editorial published online by the state-run People\u00b4s Daily newspaper on Saturday, China called the latest round of talks constructive, frank and efficient and noted that while the two sides were moving toward a resolution, 'it is impossible to resolve the problem by putting arbitrary pressure on the Chinese side.'\n\nTrump, who is eager to show farmers in political swing states that he has their backs, lauded China for agreeing to buy as much as $50 billion in agricultural products. But he left tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in place.\n\nHis announcement, while seen as progress, drew some scepticism.\n\n'I\u00b4m unsure that calling what was announced by President Trump an agreement is justified,' said Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n'If they couldn\u00b4t agree on a text, that must mean they\u00b4re not done. Wishing an agreement does not one make. This isn\u00b4t a skinny deal. It\u00b4s an invisible one.'\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is seen last week. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are both scheduled to attend a Nov. 16 summit in Chile\n\nMnuchin said the president had agreed not to proceed with a hike in tariffs to 30% from 25% on about $250 billion in Chinese goods that was supposed to have gone into effect on Tuesday.\n\nBut U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Trump had not made a decision about tariffs that were subject to go into effect in December.\n\n'I think that we\u00b4re going to have a deal that\u00b4s a great deal that\u00b4s beyond tariffs,' Trump said.\n\nTrump's new approach is to tackle China trade agreement in phases\n\nThe world's two largest economies have made progress in their trade dispute before without sealing a deal. In May U.S. officials accused China of walking away from a sweeping agreement that was nearly finished over a refusal to make changes to Chinese laws that would have ensured its enforceability.\n\nTrump had said previously he would not be satisfied with a partial deal to resolve his effort to change China's trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he argues cost millions of U.S. jobs. On Friday he said he had decided that a phased approach was appropriate.\n\nU.S. stocks ended more than 1% higher on Friday but well off the day's highs after the announcement, with the S&P 500 up 1.09% after rising as much as 1.7% earlier on hopes of an agreement.\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are both scheduled to attend a Nov. 16 summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation countries in Santiago, Chile, and Trump hinted that a written agreement could be signed there.\n\nThere have been positive signs from China in recent days.\n\nChina's securities regulator on Friday unveiled a firm timetable for scrapping foreign ownership limits in futures, securities and mutual fund companies for the first time. Increasing foreign access to the sector is among the U.S. demands at the trade talks.\n\nBeijing previously said it would further open up its financial sector on its own terms and at its own pace.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed net sales of 142,172 tonnes of U.S. pork to China in the week ended Oct. 3, the largest weekly sale to the world's top pork market on record.\n\nThe president said China had agreed to make purchases of $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. agricultural goods. Mnuchin said the purchases would be scaled up to that amount annually.\n\nA person briefed on the talks said that the proposed intellectual property provisions were largely centered on strengthening '20th century' IP protections such as those involving copyrights, trademarks and piracy. Not addressed were more difficult technology transfer issues involving data flows, cybersecurity, product standards reviews and a new social credit system that evaluates company behavior.\n\nThe status of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world\u00b4s biggest telecoms gear maker, which has been put on a U.S. trade blacklist since May, was not part of the deal, Lighthizer said.\n\nTrump said some IP issues would be left for later phases of the talks. He said talks over a second phase would begin as soon as the first phase agreement was signed and said a third phase might be necessary, too.\n\nLiang Haiming, Hong Kong-based chairman of think-tank China Silk Road iValley Research Institute, called the agreement 'anesthetic, pain relief, not an antidote.'", "description": "At a rally in Louisiana on Friday night, Trump bragged that\u00a0the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China could see U.S. agricultural imports soar to as much as $50 billion annually.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/06/19618212-0-image-a-5_1570859582734.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
