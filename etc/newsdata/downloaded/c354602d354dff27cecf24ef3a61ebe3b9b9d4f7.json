This is on top of our oil sanctions and our financial instiution sanctions.\"\n\nThe penalties come less than a week after drone attacks on a Saudi oilfield -- which the U.S. has blamed on Iran -- knocked 5 percent of the world\u2019s daily production offline. Saudi Arabia has restored some of the lost output, and said the rest would be back online by the end of the month.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo called the attacks \u201can act of war\u201d on Wednesday, setting off a verbal duel with Iranian leaders.\n\n\u201cWe won't blink to defend our territory,\" Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told CNN when asked about the consequence of a U.S. or Saudi military strike. He said such an attack would result in \"all-out war.\"\n\nThat outcome would produce \u201ca collapse in Iran\u2019s economy\u201d and cause a \u201csurge in oil prices,\u201d according to economists Jason Turvey and James Swanston at Capital Economics, a London-based research firm, although they admit the chances of a \"full-scale invasion\" are small.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur assumption is that, if war did break out, it would take the form of targeted strikes by the U.S. and its Gulf allies on Iranian military infrastructure,\u201d they wrote in a note sent to clients on Friday. \u201cIran would probably respond by stepping up disruption of maritime transit through the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d\n\nThe economists point to the Syrian civil war and the Persian Gulf War as examples of the military conflicts that damage economies. Syria\u2019s gross domestic product plunged by 60 percent, while Kuwait\u2019s fell 50 percent.\n\nIran\u2019s economy, which is much bigger than both Syria\u2019s and Kuwait\u2019s, accounts for 1.2 percent of global GDP and might therefore experience a more modest 25 percent drop in growth, Turvey and Swanston said. That would shave about 0.3 percentage point off of global growth, about the same impact as the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nSpillover effects would be particularly noticeable in the energy market.\n\n\u201cIf Iran attempted to shut the Strait of Hormuz, thereby blocking around 20 percent of global supplies, Brent crude would surge to around $150 per barrel,\u201d the economists wrote. That would be a more than 130 percent jump from the current price of $64.60 a barrel, erasing an additional 0.2 percentage point from global GDP.\n\nIran\u2019s economy will be pressured even without a military conflict: Pompeo said on Sept. 8 that the sanctions will cause the country's GDP to shrink by 12 or 14 percent this year.\n\n\u201cThis will reduce their capacity to purchase the things they need, the equipment they need, the materials they need to inflict terror around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cIran has no desire for war, but we will, and always have, defend our people and our nation,\u201d Zarif tweeted Friday.", "description": "Iran's economy could fall 25 percent during a conflict with the U.S.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/trump-rouhani-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
