I was buying healthy foods, bingeing on junk food then throwing the healthy food in the bin once it had gone bad.\n\n'We were easily spending over $300 a week between groceries and takeaway.'\n\nAfter giving birth to her second child, Cassie said she returned to her part-time job but she would end up spending $15 to $20 a day on food and snacks.\n\nDetermined to get on top of her weight and eating habits once and for all, she signed up to The Healthy Mummy's 28 Day Weight Loss Challenge in January 2017.\n\nWhat her day on a plate looks like: Cassie said she has been able to stick to her daily meals without feeling tempted to eat out or order meals at drive-through\n\nAt first, she thought meal prepping looked complicated so she was afraid to commit - but she decided to give it a go - and she hasn't looked back since.\n\n'It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.

Plus I hate to waste food I've spent time preparing.'\n\nSince mastering the art of meal prepping, Cassie said she has slashed her grocery bill by half - and she's saving up to $3,300 just by packing lunch and snacks for the two days a week she works away from home.\n\n'I'd say we are now saving around $7,000 a year on food,' she said.\n\nCassie has also been able to maintain her weight for the past two years.\n\n'I love the Healthy Mummy approach to living a healthy lifestyle as opposed to dieting. We get to enjoy everything in moderation, so I never feel as though I'm restricted,' she said.", "description": "Australian mother-of-two Cassie has proudly showed off her incredible washboard abs after shedding a stubborn 10 kilos in 28 days just by simply meal prepping.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19969698-0-image-a-56_1571613170343.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
