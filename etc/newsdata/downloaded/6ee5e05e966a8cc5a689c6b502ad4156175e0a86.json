Now, he\u2019s gone and done it\u2014and he can\u2019t get away with it unless the courts outright ignore the law.\n\nThe shots were fired in phone calls, overheard and transcribed, as the president pressed the new Ukranian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to address the madcap Rudy Giuliani\u2019s request that he investigate Joe Biden and son, Hunter. That sent a whistleblower at the Office of National Intelligence to Inspector General Michael T. Atkinson with a complaint that Trump had made nefarious \u201cpromises\u201d to a foreign leader. Atkinson, who served at the Department of Justice for over a decade during the years when Justice was blind, found the complaint of such \u201curgent concern\u201d that he sent it to the acting director of national intelligence who is obligated, by statute, to send it to Congress.\n\nBut the complaint is stymied, as Trump\u2019s minions are fighting furiously to withhold it, never mind that the law requires it be transmitted, because they, too, know that this metaphorical shooting might be different than the other metaphorical shootings. The charges are not another breach of norms, or \u201cordinary\u201d impeachable offenses Democrats swat at ineffectually.", "description": "What we have is a Nixonian modified, limited hangout, which telegraphs guilt.", "authors": ["Margaret Carlson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569298190/190923-carlson-trump-tease_u1c6ok", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
