REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo\n\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian shares closed lower on Monday, as soaring oil prices after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend dented sentiment.\n\nThe broader NSE Nifty closed down 0.65% at 11,003.5, while the benchmark BSE Sensex ended 0.70% lower at 37,123.31. The rupee was weaker by 0.88% at 71.52 against the dollar by 1014 GMT.\n\nOil prices surged nearly 20% at one point on Monday, but prices came off their peaks after U.S. President Donald Trump authorised the use of his country\u2019s emergency stockpile to ensure stable supply.\n\nHigher oil prices tend to sour investor sentiment in emerging markets like India, which is the world\u2019s third-biggest importer of oil.\n\nOil marketing firm Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd closed down 7% and saw its worst session in nearly one year. The stock was the biggest loser on the NSE Nifty.\n\nAuto and finance stocks also contributed to losses, with Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and State Bank of India sliding 2.6% and 2.4%, respectively.", "description": "Indian shares closed lower on Monday, as soaring oil prices after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend dented sentiment.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430415251&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0OO", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
