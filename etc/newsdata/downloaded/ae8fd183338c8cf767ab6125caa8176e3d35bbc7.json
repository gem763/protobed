They include Ali Alexander, a right-wing operative pushing a smear that Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (CA) isn\u2019t really \u201can American Black,\u201d a pro-Trump \u201cmemesmith\u201d who goes by the screenname \u201c@CarpeDonktum,\u201d and blogger Jim Hoft, whose Gateway Pundit blog frequently promotes hoaxes.\n\nThe invitee list also includes more traditional White House visitors, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and representatives from campus conservative group Turning Point USA and conservative YouTube channel PragerU. In an Instagram post, Turning Point executive Benny Johnson promised to use the conference to give Trump \u201cdank meme ideas.\u201d\n\nNeither Facebook or Twitter are reportedly attending the summit, suggesting that the event will mainly feature conservative allegations that the social media giants are biased against them.\n\nNotably, the group so far doesn\u2019t appear to include anyone who has actually been banned from major social platforms, even though those bans have played a significant role in driving accusations on the right that the social giants are biased. Pro-Trump figures like anti-Muslim activist Laura Loomer, InfoWars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and Proud Boys men\u2019s group founder Gavin McInnes, for example, don\u2019t appear to have been invited.\n\nThat fact hasn\u2019t been lost on fringe Trump supporters. In a livestream from Washington, D.C., InfoWars reporter and Jones lieutenant Owen Shroyer raged that no one from InfoWars was invited to the event, while people who hadn\u2019t been banned were.\n\nShroyer declared that the event was an \u201cabortion of truth\u201d and compared the invitees to dogs getting a bone and a pat on the head.\n\n\u201cThe people that are actually getting censored get ignored,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that funny?\u201d\n\nJones prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Paul Joseph Watson weighed in on the summit too, asking why no figures who have faced total social media bans were invited.\n\n\u201cHave any of the people who got invited to the social media summit actually been censored by social media?\u201d Watson tweeted.\n\nWhite House officials such as social media director Dan Scavino, a top Trump confidant and longtime aide, have taken the lead on forming the summit\u2019s agenda and assembling its eclectic guest list, according to two people familiar with the process. Scavino, who is adept at navigating the convoluted meme culture of the pro-Trump internet, keeps tabs on the work of many Trump-loving social media personalities, and will often flag their work directly to the president, who often reacts with an amused smirk or chuckle, the sources said.\n\nBut those working in the Trump White House say that, when it came time to decide whether to include hypercontroversial right-wing figures like Loomer or Jones, whose show Trump has appeared on, officials generally saw it as a painfully easy choice, even if that choice resulted in some hurt feelings.\n\n\u201cWhat benefit would it be to anyone if Laura Loomer were in the same room with the president?\u201d a senior Trump administration official familiar with the planning told The Daily Beast. \u201cWhy on earth would we do that? We aren\u2019t that stupid. Come on.\u201d\n\nLoomer and other pro-Trump personalities have raged about the summit on Telegram, a Russian messaging app she and other banned personalities have resorted to using after being kicked off Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely disgusting how poorly this summit was planned and how blatant the act was to keep banned individuals out,\u201d Loomer wrote in a Telegram post. \u201cI cannot believe that every single banned person was out of the summit.\u201d\n\nThe summit has inspired more resentments in the cutthroat world of right-wing media, with even more mainstream pro-Trump figures who think they should have been invited to the meeting left feeling snubbed. For many, an invite to the White House summit would be the equivalent to an official Trump endorsement, making them wonder why they were left out.\n\nBrandon Straka, a gay hair stylist whose \u201c#Walkaway\u201d campaign to convince traditionally Democratic voting groups to leave the party went viral on the right last year, fumed when The Daily Beast asked him why he hadn\u2019t been invited to the summit.\n\n\u201cI mean, I only had the most viral video of the conservative movement last year and started a massive movement all on social media,\u201d Straka wrote in a text message accompanied by a shrugging emoji man. \u201cBut- ummm, guess that\u2019s not a big deal??\u201d\n\nA number of fringe figures have made it onto the invite list, according to social media posts. Bill Mitchell, a prominent Trump superfan and online video personality, has claimed to be invited, despite promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory that posits that Trump is about to arrest high-ranking Democratic pedophiles and cannibals. Singer Joy Villa, who wore QAnon earrings to the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year, said Wednesday that she\u2019s also been invited.\n\nQAnon believers are obsessed with asking Trump to confirm their conspiracy in person. Given the chance to do just that on Thursday, though, Mitchell declined to take the opportunity and ask Trump about QAnon.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Mitchell told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is about social media bias, not Q.\u201d\n\nCritics in the fractious world of right-wing internet personalities said that most invitees were either establishment picks or too safe. Lucian Wintrich, a former Gateway Pundit writer who organized a raucous \u201cTwinks for Trump\u201d event during the 2016 campaign, declared invitees like Mitchell \u201cboring [as fuck].\u201d\n\n\u201cGimme a break,\u201d Wintrich told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut one would-be invitee has already proved too controversial even for Trump\u2019s White House. Organizers initially invited pro-Trump cartoonist Ben Garrison, a prolific illustrator whose cartoons, which invariably depict a muscular Trump defeating his foes, frequently go viral on the right-wing internet. But after Garrison posted his invite on Twitter, critics pointed out that Garrison once created an anti-Semitic cartoon that featured a billionaire Democratic financier and the Rothschild family controlling American political figures.\n\nFacing pressure over the Garrison invite, the White House disinvited Garrison, Politico reported. In a statement on Thursday, Garrison denied being anti-Semitic and said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the White House made his rescinded invitation public. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Garrison\u2019s invitation.\n\nIn a classic Trump move, Garrison blames the controversy on \u201cfake news.\u201d Even if he can\u2019t visit the White House on Thursday, though, Garrison might get one thing out of it. Garrison tells The Daily Beast he\u2019s considering making a cartoon about his thwarted White House visit.", "description": "No one who is invited to the summit has actually been banned from social platforms.", "authors": ["Will Sommer", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1562813356/190710-sommer-right-shadowban-summit-tease_dexutn", "published_at": "2019-07-11"}
