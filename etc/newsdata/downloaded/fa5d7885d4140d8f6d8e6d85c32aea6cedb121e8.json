(Petr David Josek/AP)\n\nVice President Pence spoke out against Russia on Monday during his European trip, criticizing President Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s government for election interference and pledging support for Poland as it seeks to bolster its military amid Russian aggression in the region.\n\n\u201cWith its efforts to meddle in elections across Europe and around the world, now is the time for us to remain vigilant about the intentions and actions being taken by Russia,\u201d Pence said during a news conference in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda.\n\nPence added that \u201cRussian forces still illegally occupy large parts of Georgia and Ukraine\u201d and chastised Moscow for seeking to divide the U.S. alliance with Poland.\n\nPence made his critical remarks just days after President Trump said it is \u201ccertainly possible\u201d he will invite Putin to the Group of Seven summit in 2020, an event Trump will host in an election year.\n\n[Trump advocates for Putin at G-7 summit in move to soften Russia\u2019s pariah status]\n\nWhile Pence remains an unwavering Trump loyalist and dutiful messenger on most issues, Monday\u2019s comments underscored the differences between the president and the vice president in how they talk about Russia, with Pence speaking as a conservative hawk this week even as Trump forcefully defends Putin.\n\nMarc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, said in a brief interview Monday that Pence and Trump are aligned on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cNo president has been as tough on Russia as Donald Trump, and while they may have different ways of expressing Russian concerns, they share the same priorities and goals,\u201d Short said. \u201cAs with China, Donald Trump can be both confrontational and engaging.\u201d\n\nAt the G-7 summit in France in late August, Trump blamed the Crimea crisis on former president Barack Obama, not Putin, and alleged Obama was determined to kick Russia out of the G-7 because it was \u201cvery embarrassing to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it would be better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nTrump\u2019s invitation would soften Russia\u2019s pariah status and potentially bring it back into an elite club of some of the most powerful industrialized nations that lent Putin prized international legitimacy during the years he attended. Russia was booted following its 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, slimming the Group of Eight by a member.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s latest hard line on Russia echoes previous comments by Pence that have rebuked Putin. But the timing this week was particularly notable, coming near the start of Pence\u2019s trip across Europe, which is being closely watched by longtime U.S. allies for the Trump administration\u2019s position on Russia.\n\nPence was also standing in for Trump in Poland. Trump had planned to visit with Duda, a leading foreign ally of the president. But he postponed his trip because of Hurricane Dorian and asked Pence to travel in his place.\n\n[Trump cancels trip to Poland, says he is staying in the U.S. to monitor Hurricane Dorian]\n\nPence, who is widely seen in GOP circles as a possible 2024 presidential contender, has often been careful and conservative with his statements on foreign policy \u2014 speaking generously about Trump\u2019s leadership and his agenda, but doing do calmly and without the brash nationalistic language used by the president.\n\nWhen Duda said at the news conference that he has reservations about any move by Trump or others to bring Russia back into the fold with an invitation to next year\u2019s G-7 summit, Pence did not contest him.\n\n\u201cThis is a very complex issue because the situation with Russia is very difficult,\u201d Duda said. \u201cIf we look at the behavior of Russia over the last couple of years, we have to be clear in saying that if somebody realizes their imperial ambitions through changing the borders, through military attack, and that is what happened.\u201d\n\nDuda said that \u201cnobody who respects the dignity of other nations and states can turn a blind eye to\u201d the actions taken by Putin\u2019s government in Crimea.\n\n\u201cI believe that we must not proceed according to the business-as-usual principle. This is my position, and I don\u2019t hesitate to express it,\u201d he said.\n\nPence praised Poland for being \u201cone of only seven NATO allies that currently meets the commitment to spend at least 2 percent of your gross domestic product on defense.\u201d That commitment has enabled the United States to fully support Poland\u2019s purchase of American-made weapons so it can defend its sovereignty, Pence said.\n\nPence\u2019s Monday comments on Russia followed his assurance Sunday that Ukraine has U.S. support, as national security adviser John Bolton, who has also been a Putin critic, looked on.\n\nSpeaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following an event in Warsaw, Pence said the United States has \u201cstood strongly for the territorial integrity of Ukraine\u201d since 2014 and \u201cwill continue to stand with the people of the Ukraine on your security, on territorial integrity, including Ukraine\u2019s rightful claim to Crimea.\u201d\n\nOther issues loomed for Pence\u2019s meeting with Duda. The Trump administration has been slow to call out Poland\u2019s governing party, Law and Justice, as its elected officials breach the country\u2019s constitution and support candidates and leaders who seek to erode LGBTQ rights.\n\nMost recently, Poland\u2019s deputy justice minister was forced to resign after it emerged that his ministry had waged a harassment campaign against judges resisting government efforts to control the judiciary.\n\nWhen asked if he confronted Duda on issues of gay rights, press freedom and judicial independence during their private meeting Monday, Pence said he did discuss judicial independence with Duda \u2014 but he did not say whether press freedom or LGBTQ rights were part of the conversation.\n\n\u201cWe talked about the importance of judicial independence and the rule of law,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAs I told President Duda, we are grateful for his commitment to strengthening the foundations of the rule of law in Poland. It is right and just, but it also, we believe, is the surest way to encourage better foreign direct investment.\u201d\n\nAmid the ongoing trade war with China, Pence also signed a security declaration Monday with Poland that puts new pressure on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, which the United States has asserted is involved with espionage activities.\n\nPence traveled later Monday to Shannon, Ireland, where he met with that nation\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, who warned Pence that Brexit in the United Kingdom could cause \u201cdisruption\u201d for Ireland and the peace at its northern border.\n\nPence said he was \u201cgrateful for your candor,\u201d following Coveney\u2019s remarks before a throng of reporters and television cameras.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work closely with our partners in Ireland and the United Kingdom to support a Brexit plan that encourages stability and also one that keeps the strong foundation forged by the Good Friday Agreement,\u201d Pence said, a reference to the landmark 1998 peace accord with Northern Ireland.\n\nPence is scheduled to meet later this week with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nPence, whose paternal and maternal roots can be traced to Ireland, is staying at Trump International Golf Links & Hotel in Doonbeg. He is traveling with the second lady, Karen Pence, and his mother, Nancy Pence Fritsch.\n\nMichael Birnbaum and Philip Rucker contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Polish President Andrzej Duda expressed reservations about any move by Trump or others to bring Russia back into the fold with an invite to next year\u2019s summit in the United States.", "authors": ["Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress", "September At Pm", "Robert Costa Is A National Political Reporter For The Washington Post.
