Elites they were in the same country club as.\n\nThis populism led to Brexit paralysis here and Trumpian lunacy in America, otherwise known as banging your head against a wall \u00adwhenever you turned on a news channel.\n\nIn the Tortured Teens every hit film had to be about a superhero, music was so bland Ed Sheeran became a megastar and you only heard decent tunes when a legend like Bowie died. A time when Netflix deservedly murdered traditional telly because all it was showing was washed-up ex-reality TV contestants dancing, baking, or eating a wallaby\u2019s scrotum.\n\nA decade when most adults had a parent with dementia who had to sell their house to get into a care home. When Uber killed black taxis, Spotify killed CDs, Amazon killed the high street, everyone was offended by \u00adeverything and irony died a slow death as successive Tory prime ministers vowed to save the NHS.\n\nIn the Tortured Teens tantrums were thrown in \u00adrestaurants when your only choice was sucking fusion cuisine off a piece of slate, and in pubs when the hipster in front of you demanded to sample every craft ale tap before buying.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nIt was the decade when trolls were given a free pass to spread poison from their mum\u2019s spare bedroom and conversation died as people lived life through their hand-held selfie machines.\n\nEven as ISIS were beheading victims in caves, people watching on their phones had pop-up adverts reminding them about their recent Botox enquiry.\n\nSo how apt that the Tortured Teens ends with a sulking man-child like Trump creating a vacuum in the Middle East which could end up as the Third World War while another one, Boris Johnson, sticks his fingers in his ears and whistles as grown-up \u00adpoliticians yell at him for leading us into a no-deal wasteland.\n\nAnd young people block roads and airports to warn that we\u2019re selfishly destroying planet Earth, but there\u2019s only one thing we\u2019re emotionally invested in as we gawp excitedly at our selfie-machines:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s...
