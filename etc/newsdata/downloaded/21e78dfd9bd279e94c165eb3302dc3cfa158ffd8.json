I collapsed basically. My mum was with me and she put her arms around me and I collapsed into her arms crying.\"\n\nImage copyright Lisa Parratt Image caption Lisa Parratt currently weighs 25 stone, after losing two and a half stone through going to the gym and changing her diet\n\nCan someone be 'too big' for bootcamp?\n\nImage copyright Diren Kartal\n\nPersonal trainer Diren Kartal, who has more than 96,000 followers on Instagram, saw the post and Facetimed Ms Parratt offering to help.\n\n\"I just want her to do well and shove it in his face after because I actually felt for her,\" he said.\n\nMr Kartal said it is not possible to be too big for bootcamp.\n\n\"Even if someone was huge it doesn't matter,\" he said.\n\n\"If someone like that came to my bootcamp I would modify the exercises to ensure she feels comfortable and confident to actually push through and get better results and to ensure she's in a healthy and good mental state.\n\n\"Because for someone like that to go to a personal trainer, even a bootcamp where there are loads of people, it takes so much courage.\n\n\"If they come to a bootcamp they should not be rejected like that.\"\n\nAfter reading all of the comments she said she was \"so grateful of everybody's support\".\n\nMs Parratt said she hopes to to raise awareness about the damage such comments can do.\n\n\"I've been bullied since I was 15 or 16 and started putting on weight and getting a bit chunky,\" said Ms Parratt.\n\n\"I still suffer it now. People seem to think they can make comments whenever they want to and I don't think it's right, and I'm going to start and stand up for bigger women.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nTo discuss an East Midlands story idea, contact caroline.lowbridge@bbc.co.uk.", "description": "Lisa Parratt says she was \"gutted\" when told she was \"too heavy\" for a personal trainer's classes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14F6A/production/_108766858_lisa4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
