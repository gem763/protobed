Yet while Modi has brought the issue into mainstream political discourse, evidence suggests there remains a massive gap between the rhetoric and reality of the achievement of universal sanitation under his watch. Open defecation still prevails, alongside problems concerning sustainability and equity, especially for sanitation workers, and rights-based access.\n\nBut what is most worrying is Modi\u2019s human rights record and divisive politics, which prevent the realisation of the global goals that BMGF promotes. During his time as Gujarat chief minister and India\u2019s prime minister, inflammatory hate speech, vigilante nationalism and violent acts against Christians, Muslims and women have been widespread. Freedom of speech and the right to dissent is under fire. Activists and critics have been jailed, killed and accused of being anti-national.\n\nAlthough imperfections exist in any democracy, the attitude of leaders is crucial when faced with such events. Mr Modi has generally reacted with either silence or a delayed and weak response. More recently, the Modi government\u2019s repressive communication blockade and militarised actions in Kashmir and the crisis of detention camps that is unfolding due to the national register of citizens in Assam have undermined democratic process, and the health, security and rights of Indian citizens in these states.\n\nThe BMGF award, along with the Seoul peace prize and UNEP\u2019s Champions of Earth prize, serves to legitimise and embolden Modi and his supporters to intensify their divisive politics in a way that is in complete contradiction with the spirit and soul of sustainable, equitable and fair development.\n\nProf Lyla Mehta Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nDr Kamal Kar Honorary associate, Institute of Development Studies, UK and Community-Led Total Sanitation Foundation\n\nDr Shilpi Srivastava Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nMr Deepak Sanan Sanitation activist, India\n\nShibaji Bose Independent media consultant, India\n\nDr Arnab Acharya Economics and statistical consultant, USA\n\nProf Vinita Damodaran University of Sussex, UK\n\nDr Anuradha Joshi Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nProf Sanjay Reddy New School for Social Research, USA\n\nDr Deepta Chopra Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nDr Pauline Oosterhoff Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nDr Subir Sinha School of Oriental and African Studies, UK\n\nDr Prarit Agarwal Department of physics and astronomy, Seoul National University, South Korea\n\nProf Ian Bryceson Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Norway\n\nDr Dolf te Lintelo Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nProf Ben Rogaly University of Sussex, UK\n\nDr Gavin Collins National University of Ireland Galway, Ireland\n\nDr Lars Otto Naess Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nDr Synne Movik Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Norway\n\nDr Suchi Pande Research scholar, USA\n\nProf Emeritus Bill Derman Norwegian University of the Life Sciences\n\nDr Nicholas Nisbett Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nProf Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt The Australian National University\n\nDr Rosemary Collard Simon Fraser University, Canada\n\nProf Ian Scoones IDS, University of Sussex, UK\n\nDr. Rohan D\u2019Souza Kyoto University, Japan\n\nDr Syed Abbas Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nSeema Kulkarni Feminist, water and sanitation advocate, India\n\nDr James Ebdon University of Brighton, UK\n\nDr Pragya Srivatsava University of Pennsylvania, USA\n\nProf Khalid Nadvi Global Development Institute, University of Manchester, UK\n\nProf Bridget Byrne University of Manchester, UK\n\nDr Vera Mehta Senior advisor, Intergovernmental consultations, New York, US\n\nProf Sanae Ito Nagoya University, Japan\n\nDr Amrita Saha Institute of Development Studies, UK\n\nShruti Ajit Researcher, India\n\nDr Andr\u00e9s Hueso Sanitation specialist, UK", "description": "Letters: 37 development academics and practitioners condemn the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation over its intention to give the Goalkeepers Global Goals award to the Indian prime minister", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/306a994e4e38078e0fb03a02951c348ff446ebd7/0_0_2638_1582/master/2638.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f28c9eda33628f0699fc8dcf6fd2db0c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
