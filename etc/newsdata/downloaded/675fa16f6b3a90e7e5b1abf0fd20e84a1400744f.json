We would argue you want to be defensively positioned [and] we would argue that the U.S. equity market has run way, way ahead of growth,\u201d says Chadha.\n\nThe S&P, he notes, tends to be \u201cvery strongly correlated\u201d with indicators of cyclical growth like the Institute for Supply Management survey (ISM), which fell into contraction territory last month. It suggests the index should be at 2,600, not at current levels just below 3,000, which appear to price in a \u201cgood solid rebound\u201d for the ISM.\n\nElsewhere, he says annual U.S. jobs growth slowed from 2.5% in the middle of last year to 1.3% last month, marking the weakest expansion in 10 years, and nearing \u201cstall-speed\u201d for the economy.\n\n\u201cEvery time payrolls growth has gone below 1%, the U.S. has ended up in recession. We would argue the U.S. economy is dangerously close to...tipping into recession,\u201d he said, adding that the fate of the economy hinges on one thing - the trade war.\n\nHe said a market sell off would make President Trump more likely to relent on trade policy.\n\n\u201cI would argue that\u2019s a necessary condition for growth to bottom and rebound and or the stock market to go up in a sustainable way,\u201d he says.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t happen, Chadha says he will kiss goodbye his own \u201cvery bullish\u201d year-end S&P forecast of 3,250.\n\nThe market\n\nOil CLV19, -0.89% is reversing some of Monday\u2019s historic gains, as another weak day builds for stocks, with Dow YM00, -0.08%, S&P ES00, -0.06% and Nasdaq NQ00, -0.06% futures all down. Gold GCZ19, -0.32% is lower, while the dollar DXY, -0.40% is flat.\n\nEuropean stocks SXXP, -0.05% are struggling, while Asia markets ADOW, -0.60% got hit by Saudi-related tensions.\n\nOpinion: Why stock investors are overreacting to the Saudi attack\n\nThe economy\n\nIndustrial production and capacity utilization data, followed by a home builders\u2019 index, are on tap, along with the start of the Fed\u2019s two-day meeting (see preview).\n\nThe chart\n\nHere\u2019s one question making the rounds: Could the Fed not cut interest rates this week? The CME FedWatch Tool, based on the Fed Funds futures, shows a 33% chance of no change, versus last week\u2019s 8% possibility.\n\nAnother way to gauge the possibility is via eurodollar futures ED00, +0.00% , which settle at a three-month rate that tends to be in step with Fed\u2019s target rate.\n\nHere\u2019s a one-month eurodollar chart US:EDU19 and our chart the day. The higher those futures rise, the lower the implied Fed rate and it\u2019s been going down -- suggesting there are at least a few bets the central bank could surprise Wednesday:\n\nMarketWatch\n\nThe tweet\n\nBuffett\u2019s first ever TV interview, back when 500m was still a lot of money :-D Still singing from the same songsheet.
