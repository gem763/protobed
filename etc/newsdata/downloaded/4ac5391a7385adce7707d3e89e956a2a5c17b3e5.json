The Bronze Age is the period of time characterised by the casting of bronze. It also exhibited forms of proto-writing and other features of early urban civilisation. In central Europe, the Bronze Age lasted from 2,200\u2013800 BC. Archaeologist believe that the materials needed for bronze working cultivated migration, as it called for the transport of materials across Europe. Social networks across Europe were forged though marriage, it is thought. The Nebra sky disk, a Bronze Age artefact from Saxony-Anhalt, in Germany\n\nArchaeologists Philipp Stockhammer of LMU Munich, along with Alissa Mittnik and Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute for Human History and colleagues studied Bronze Age communities in Germany's Lech Valley.\n\nThe eponymous bronze-working of this period had led to an early equivalent of globalisation, as it called for the transport of raw materials all around Europe.\n\nIn a previous study, the research team had found that, around 4,000 years ago, the majority of women living in the Lech Valley had come from abroad.\n\nThe researchers concluded that trans-European networks were likely by fostered through marriage and other institutionalised forms of mobility \u2014 spreading knowledge and cultural practices in their wake.\n\nTo explore the impacts of this mobility on households during the Bronze Age, the researchers examined remains taken from homesteads and associated graveyards.\n\nAncient DNA from more than 100 skeletons \u2014 alongside analyses of grave artefacts and the relative locations of different burials \u2014 allowed the team to create the first-ever reconstruction of ancient family trees, spanning around four\u2013five generations.\n\n'Archaeogenetics provides us with a completely new view of the past. Until recently, we would not have thought it possible to examine marriage rules, social structure and social inequality in prehistory,' says Professor Krause.\n\nThe team were only able to follow the lineages of the men in the families, finding that the women appeared to leave the farms when they reached adulthood.\n\nReplacing them, women moved in from long distances \u2014 up to several hundred kilometres away \u2014 to mother new sons, the researchers found.\n\nAncient DNA from more than 100 skeletons \u2014 alongside analyses of grave artefacts and the relative locations of different burials \u2014 allowed the team to create the first-ever reconstruction of ancient family trees, spanning around four\u2013five generations\n\nGrave goods gave insights as to the social status of the ancient individuals who lived in the Lech Valley \u2014 with elaborate jewellery and weapons only found in the graves of either closely-related family members or the women who came from afar.\n\nIn the same cemeteries, however, the researchers also noted genetically unrelated individuals of local origin who were buried without high-status goods.\n\n'Wealth was correlated with either biological kinship or foreign origin. The nuclear family passed on their property and status over generations,' said Professor Stockhammer.\n\n'But at every farm we also found poorly equipped people of local origin.'\n\nSimilar households with complex social structures are also known from Classical Greece and Rome. In the latter, for example, slaves were considered to be part of the family unit while still bearing a different social status.\n\nThe communities of the Lech Valley, however, predate those of the Romans by around 1,500 years.\n\n'This shows how long the history of social inequality in family structures goes back in time,' noted Stockhammer.\n\nArchaeologists Philipp Stockhammer of LMU Munich, along with Alissa Mittnik and Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute for Human History and colleagues studied Bronze Age communities in Germany's Lech Valley\n\n'Unfortunately, we cannot say whether these individuals were servants and maids or perhaps even enslaved,' said Dr Mittnik.\n\n'What is certain is that through the male lines, the farmsteads were passed from generation to generation and this system was stable over at least 700 years, across the transition from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age.\n\n'The Lech Valley shows how early social inequality within individual households can be found.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Science.", "description": "Archaeologists led from LMU Munich and the\u00a0Max Planck Institute for Human History\u00a0studied Bronze Age communities in Germany's Lech Valley.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19546406-0-image-a-69_1570721439257.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
