What a testament to failure you\u2019ve become.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of numbers \u2014 showing the breakdown of America\u2019s foundations: 70% of millennials say they are either extremely likely or somewhat likely to vote socialist. And the percentage who are now \u201cextremely likely\u201d has doubled in the past year, from 10% to 20%.\n\nAbout a fourth of respondents of all ages say President Donald Trump is the biggest threat to world peace, even more so than North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\n\nAnd get this: \u201cOnly 57% of Millennials believe the Declaration of Independence better \u2018guarantees freedom and quality\u2019 over [the] Communist Manifesto,\u201d Victims of Communism wrote.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nCapitalism, the bedrock of America\u2019s economy, is falling in favor at the same time socialist, the scourge of failing, falling nations, is rising in U.S. youthful minds. Between 2018 and 2019, only half of millennials, ages 23-to-38, and Generation Z-ers, ages 16-to-22, gave high marks to capitalism.\n\n\u201cThe historical amnesia about the dangers of communism and socialism is on full display in this year\u2019s report,\u201d said Marion Smtih, executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t educate our youngest generations about the historical truth of 100 million victims murdered at the hands of communist regimes over the past century, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised at their willingness to embrace Marxist ideas. We need to redouble our efforts to educate America\u2019s youth about the history of communist regimes and the dangers of socialism today.\u201d\n\nSort of.\n\nRedoubling efforts won\u2019t accomplish much if America\u2019s schools, from elementary through higher places of learning, are filled with far-leftist-slash-Marxists. Before redoubling, we should clear house.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed are more Christians, more constitutionalists, more tea party types, more conservatives, more traditionalists in teaching positions at America\u2019s schools.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is a balancing of the current leftist dominance.\n\nWithout, no effort, redoubled or otherwise, will prove fruitful in teaching the truth. Socialism is a rot, an evil rot, a historically failed evil rot, and any teaching that doesn\u2019t underscore this basic fact won\u2019t change the pro-socialist, anti-capitalist minds of America\u2019s youth.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
