(Chris Kleponis/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe House Oversight and Reform Committee on Monday sought documents from Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao as it investigates what it calls \u201ctroubling questions\u201d into whether the Trump appointee misused her position for personal and family benefit.\n\nNoting that federal employees are forbidden from using public office for friends\u2019 or relatives\u2019 \u201cprivate gain,\u201d the committee\u2019s letter to Chao cites media reports that allege the secretary leveraged her position to help Foremost Group \u2014 a New York-based shipping company that carries goods between the United States and China and that is owned by her father and sisters \u2014 gain \u201cinfluence and status\u201d with the Chinese government that has given the firm millions in loans.\n\nThe sweeping request for documents follows growing scrutiny of Chao and joins a host of inquiries into the Trump administration by a Democrat-led House. The committee cites reporting by the New York Times this summer that the Transportation Department canceled a fall 2017 trip to China after State Department staff members grew leery of Chao\u2019s efforts to include relatives in meetings with Chinese officials. House investigators are also examining Chao\u2019s appearances with her father, James Chao, in interviews that featured the DOT\u2019s seal, and Monday\u2019s letter alleges the secretary\u2019s father \u201ctouted [Chao\u2019s] influence within the United States government and boasted about his access to President Trump on Air Force One.\u201d\n\nThe Transportation Department pushed back on claims of ethics violations Monday, saying in a statement to The Washington Post that Chao has not been involved with the family\u2019s shipping business for more than four decades. The department confirmed it received the committee\u2019s letter and said it looks forward to responding.\n\n\u201cMedia attacks targeting the Secretary\u2019s family are stale and only attempt to undermine her long career of public service,\u201d the department wrote.\n\nWhile Chao does not have a formal stake in Foremost Group, James Chao has given millions to his daughter and her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the New York Times reported this summer. Other relatives, including a sister who serves as the company\u2019s chief executive, have donated more than $1 million to McConnell\u2019s reelection efforts, according to the Times. David Popp, a spokesman for McConnell, told The Post the money from James Chao was in memory of Chao\u2019s mother but did not provide comment on the House investigation letter.\n\nAn article in Politico last year highlighted dozens of media interviews in which Chao stood beside her father \u2014 sometimes in conjunction with flags for the Transportation Department or Kentucky. Experts told Politico the interviews could be interpreted as promoting Chao\u2019s father\u2019s book or signaling the Chaos\u2019 valuable U.S. connections in China.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing inappropriate with a Cabinet member appearing with her father or other family members,\u201d a DOT spokesperson responded at the time. \u201cThe secretary\u2019s appearances are intended to share an inspirational story about immigrants from a minority community who have become successful in our country.\u201d\n\nBut others in the government have questioned Chao\u2019s mixing of family and official business since she became head of the Transportation Department in 2017.\n\n\u201cThis was alarmingly inappropriate,\u201d David Rank, a former State Department staffer, said of the China visit canceled over Chao\u2019s attempts to involve relatives, according to the Times.\n\nThe Oversight and Reform Committee\u2019s letter also probes recent moves by the Transportation Department to cut millions from programs meant to help the U.S. shipping industry, saying the department\u2019s actions \u201cmay threaten national security\u201d by making the country potentially more dependent on foreign-flagged ships during war or emergencies. The Department\u2019s proposals included ultimately rejected cuts to the Maritime Security Program, which helps ensure the military can access American-flagged ships in times of need.\n\nRemoving domestic maritime funding could have helped Foremost Group because the company owns foreign-flagged ships, the letter says.\n\nThe committee raises further concerns about Chao\u2019s failure to divest from a construction company reliant on DOT infrastructure allocations until this summer \u2014 despite a promise to do so in 2017, before she was confirmed to the position. Chao sold her stock in Vulcan Materials Company, where she once served on the board of directors, days after a Wall Street Journal report drew attention to her continued holdings.\n\nAmid scrutiny of the Vulcan shares, a June 13 DOT letter to the Office of Government Ethics described \u201cinadvertent misstatements of fact\u201d in Chao\u2019s earlier financial disclosures and an ethics agreement. The Oversight Committee says it is examining these misstatements as well as Chao\u2019s compliance with ethics and disclosure requirements.\n\nThe committee\u2019s letter makes 18 requests for documents and information, ranging from any communications about Foremost involving DOT employees to unredacted copies of documents released to the Times under a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nIt asks that Chao fulfill the requests by Sept. 30.\n\nThe investigation could lead to higher penalties for inaccurate financial statements, new disclosure requirements or other changes in the law, the letter signed by Reps. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) states.\n\nThe Transportation Department disputed the allegations against Chao on many fronts in its statement to The Post on Monday. It suggested the Chao family\u2019s shipping company falls outside the department\u2019s purview, saying its Maritime Administration is \u201cnot a major regulator of the maritime industry\u201d and deals mostly with domestic shipping. Foremost Group does not operate U.S.-flagged vessels and is \u201cnot involved in the domestic U.S. merchant marine shipping business,\u201d the department said.\n\nThe department countered criticism of its past proposed cuts to domestic shipping programs by saying the Maritime Administration\u2019s operating budget is larger than ever. The department requested the full $300 million authorized for the Maritime Security Program this year and is working to replace training ships for marine academies, it said.\n\nThe department added that its ethics officials do not see Chao\u2019s stock in Vulcan Materials as a conflict of interest and said the secretary has been recused from issues involving the company. Chao sold her stocks anyway due to a \u201ccommitment to going above and beyond what is required,\u201d the department said.\n\nThe department attributed errors in Chao\u2019s ethics disclosures to a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d\n\nThe Oversight and Reform Committee did not immediately respond Monday to questions.\n\nRead more:\n\nTracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far\n\nMcConnell dismisses report that his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, steered funds to Kentucky", "description": "The Committee\u2019s letter to Chao cites media reports that the Secretary leveraged her position to help Foremost Group \u2014 a New York-based shipping company that carries goods between the U.S. and China and that is owned by her father and sisters \u2014 to gain \u201cinfluence and status\u201d with the Chinese government, which has given the firm millions in loans.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dEcSIa1EpKU867QYNj0mbBly04A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RBWZOPWYZII6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
