Accordingly, the company's bids were higher on potential jobs \u2014 and it lost out on contracts.\n\nRJ Steel also gave up on purchasing new equipment, such as a shear to cut large pieces of steel, and dropped plans to hire at least one new worker. Existing employees started to worry as well.\n\n\"They want certainty. I don't blame them. I would, too,\" said Jordan, in an interview with Paul Haavardsrud on CBC Radio's Cost of Living.\n\nDespite the Trump administration dropping the tariffs against Canada in May, it's still not business as usual at RJ Steel.\n\nThe company isn't adding the new equipment or the new employee. It's just one example of the continuing uncertainty that remains.\n\nMultiply that caution across companies around Canada and around the world, and the issue compounds.\n\nWhether it's businesses holding off on investments or worried employees passing on major purchases because they are concerned they won't have work, a lack of confidence itself leads to what amounts to a holding pattern for a large part of the economy.\n\nMore worried than during 2008 financial crisis\n\nIn Canada, people are more worried right now than during the financial crisis of 2008, according to at least one indicator.\n\nEconomists at Stanford University are actually tracking the level of worry in something they call the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index. It measures how often terms related to precariousness are used in the news.\n\n\"This is really a unique period of quick changes and large changes in trade policy and uncertainty about future trade policy,\" said Scott Baker, one of the index's creators.\n\n\"At every point in time when it seems like we've stabilized a little bit, there seems to be some new shock or new event or new tweet that comes out and makes everyone a bit less sure of what's going to go on,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, centre, gestures as he chats with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, right, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin looks on, in Shanghai on July 31. (Ng Han Guan/Reuters)\n\nWhile the ongoing disputes between the U.S. and China could be considered a big driver of global uncertainty, the question marks around Brexit are contributing as are potential economic slowdowns in Germany and Venezuela.\n\n\"It's hard to say exactly where things are going to land,\" said Baker.\n\nWith files from Paul Haavardsrud and Anis Heydari", "description": "The Cost of Living looks at how uncertainty elsewhere in the world is affecting Canada and businesses close to home.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5273463.1567788496!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trump-and-steel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
