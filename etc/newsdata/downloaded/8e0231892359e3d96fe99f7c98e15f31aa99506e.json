He was purple and perfectly formed, weighing all of 5 pounds and 12 ounces. He stretched his tiny arms and legs into the air as hospital staff hovered over him to count 10 toes and 10 fingers. His skin turned from purple to a light brown, and he cried, knowing nothing about his world.\n\nThere is a picture of homelessness etched in public perception: a solitary, disheveled man, begging on a crowded sidewalk, holding a cardboard sign. But the largest single population in New York City\u2019s shelter system is children under the age of 6.\n\nInfants carry a disruptive power. Their births can drive entire families to homelessness or lengthen their stays in a shelter.\n\n\u201cPop quiz. At what age are you most likely to be homeless?\u201d asked Allyson Crawford, chief executive of Room to Grow, a nonprofit that helps poor parents with newborns. \u201cThe answer is 1.\u201d\n\nNew York City has a list of official causes of homelessness, and high on the list are eviction, overcrowding, family discord and domestic violence. Look closely and pregnancy is often intertwined, advocates for the homeless say.\n\nA woman becomes pregnant, and suddenly, the two-bedroom apartment she is sharing with her family becomes too small. Faced with added responsibility once the baby is born, she falls behind on bills and rent. Family tensions rise. She argues with parents or with her partner. She may become a victim of domestic violence. Too often, she ends up moving into a shelter and so does her child.\n\nSteven Banks, the city\u2019s commissioner of social services, said infants are often \u201cthe tipping point\u201d for families on the verge of losing a permanent home. \u201cThe main driver of homelessness, irrespective of pregnancy, is the gap between rent and income,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the birth of a new child is a background factor.\u201d\n\nWhen Antonio was a week old, he was one of 11,234 children under 6 living in a shelter system that houses about 60,000 people daily. There were 1,164 children born into the shelter system last year, up from 877 in 2015, according to data obtained by the Coalition for the Homeless.\n\nLast year, 1,164 children were born into the shelter system.\n\nCramped quarters and little cash\n\nIn the Brooklyn shelter where Antonio lives, his family stays in what amounts to a studio apartment, with a small kitchen and bathroom and two sets of bunk beds in the main room. His 4-year-old sister and 14-year-old brother sleep on one of the bunk beds, the little girl below, the teenage boy above. His parents, Shimika Sanchez and Tony Sanchez, squeeze into the bottom bunk across the room, while he sleeps in a brown crib.\n\nMs. Sanchez said the couple put nearly all of their belongings in a storage unit that costs $213 a month.\n\nThree strategically placed fans cool the room, though sometimes, on scorching days, they only push the hot air. Her son does homework and studies at a small dining table flush against the same wall where his parents sleep.\n\nMs. Sanchez, 34, had a difficult pregnancy and had been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, a condition that can cause dangerously high blood pressure and can be fatal to the mother and fetus. Ms. Sanchez, a home health aide, said a doctor had encouraged her to stop working.\n\nMr. Sanchez, 36, is an ex-convict and has trouble finding well-paid positions. He works odd jobs, like demolition on construction sites.\n\nThey have been trying to save enough to move out of the shelter. They argue all the time about money.\n\nThe lack of money is exacerbated when a child is born, and can have an even greater impact on homeless mothers. Several studies have shown that homeless pregnant women experience high rates of depression.\n\nA 2011 study of homelessness in 31 cities, including New York, showed that infants born to homeless mothers are at greater risk of longer stays in the hospital. Children begin to show signs of emotional problems and developmental delays by 18 months. They also have poorer nutrition and go to fewer preventive medical appointments, including for vaccinations, according to the study published in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nCity agencies have started to grapple with the problem. Officials have taken steps to raise awareness about crib death in shelters. They also have created a questionnaire to assess birth weight and signs of developmental delay and have started several pilot programs, including one to promote reading to infants. Robin Hood, the antipoverty charity, is leading two pilot programs focused on combatting maternal depression and encouraging the bond between mother and child.\n\nLast year, 2,358 families in the city\u2019s main shelter system had children under 1 year old.\n\nLost everything in Hurricane Sandy\n\nMs. Sanchez began considering moving into a shelter four years ago after Bella was born, and Ms. Sanchez\u2019s parents, who were never married, reunited romantically. At the same time, Mr. Sanchez was months away from being released from prison, and Ms. Sanchez wondered how her family of five would fit in her mother\u2019s three-bedroom apartment, where her two younger sisters and a niece were also living.\n\nShe has been living doubled-up most of her adult life. In 2012, the apartment she shared with her mother and two sisters in Far Rockaway, Queens, was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy.\n\nFor several months, the family lived in a hotel room paid for through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Then they moved to a house in Brooklyn with a Section 8 voucher, a federal rental subsidy. They had lost everything.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018At least, we had our lives,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sanchez\u2019s mother, Mary Brown, said. \u201cWe had rough times. We all did. Me and my kids.\u201d\n\nMs. Sanchez entered a city shelter in March 2017, and her husband joined her after he was released from prison that fall.\n\nA high school dropout, Ms. Sanchez earned her equivalency diploma and then a certificate in medical assistance from Sanford-Brown Institute, a for-profit college that paid a $1 million fine for misleading its students as part of a court settlement with the state attorney general.\n\n\u201cI pay $300 a month in school loans,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said.\n\nHomeless pregnant women experience high rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAn alarming visit to the doctor\n\nOn a Tuesday morning in early August, Ms. Sanchez, who was 33 weeks pregnant, waddled into the Brookdale Hospital waiting room with her husband and daughter for a prenatal checkup. Mr. Sanchez lifted Bella, buried his face into her stomach and spun around.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be surprised I made it on time,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said as she settled into a seat.\n\nMr. Sanchez\u2019s phone rang. It was a call for another odd job. Mr. Sanchez\u2019s criminal history, including three burglary charges, limited his job choices, and he could not pass up a chance to work. He had to go, he told his wife.\n\nHe kissed her and kissed his daughter. \u201cYou have money?\u201d he asked, digging his hands into the pockets of his khaki shorts as he stood in the doorway of the waiting room.\n\n\u201cYes, you gave me money,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said.\n\nThe chilly waiting room had a dozen or so chairs in a semicircle. Everyone joined in each other\u2019s conversations. One woman was breast-feeding her baby. A man looked at his phone. When Ms. Sanchez stepped out of the room to have her blood pressure taken, her phone rang and Bella picked it up.\n\n\u201cHello, what\u2019s up?\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t get mama on the phone because she\u2019s out there. I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d someone in the room asked. \u201cMy daddy,\u201d she said. Everybody laughed.\n\nWhen Ms. Sanchez returned, she talked about how much she missed a job she had held as a home health aide. She was proud that she had found ways to befriend older white people who had misperceptions, or even racist views, about black people. \u201cYou become someone they have to rely on,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said.\n\nBella grew bored. She tried to dance and sang the lyrics of Drake\u2019s \u201cIn My Feelings\u201d over and over again though she only knew a few of the words. She took her shoes off and refused to put them back on. Her toenails were covered in chipped white and pink nail polish.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, a physician assistant called Ms. Sanchez in and told her that her blood pressure was unusually high. She was scared.\n\nCyrus McCalla, her doctor, decided she needed to remain in the hospital overnight. Usually, Ms. Sanchez could calm herself, slowly breathing in and out. But her blood pressure was not dropping, and her condition grew more serious as the day wore on.\n\nBy 4:05 p.m., she had been transferred to a hospital room in the labor and delivery wing. \u201cI need to call my husband and tell him I\u2019m here,\u201d she told a nurse.\n\nShe called her mother to pick up her daughter, who had climbed on the hospital bed and rested her head in her mother\u2019s lap.\n\nMs. Sanchez tried not to panic, but she thought about her room at the shelter. She fretted about Antonio\u2019s crib. Win, the nonprofit operator of the shelter, required Ms. Sanchez to use a crib it provided. She had taken a photo of the crib, which was metal and painted white. It looked like a shopping cart, she said, without the handle. It sat low to the floor, and she worried that mice could get in. \u201cHow does that pass a safety test?\u201d she asked.\n\nMs. Sanchez did not give birth that day.\n\nNaturally petite, she weighed just 97 pounds. Baby Antonio weighed an estimated 4 pounds. She had delivered her daughter 10 weeks early, and doctors were trying hard to avoid a similarly premature labor. It was her second overnight hospital stay in two weeks.\n\nWhen Antonio was born he was one of 11,234 children under the age of 6 living in the shelter system.\n\nA Rough three weeks\n\nOver the next three weeks, Ms. Sanchez had contractions that forced her to go to the hospital and derailed several outings, including a night out with friends at Red Lobster and shopping for baby clothes.\n\nBut on a Wednesday in late August, her doctor decided that Ms. Sanchez should be induced. Ultrasounds showed that Antonio weighed more than 5 pounds, close to 6.\n\nMs. Sanchez arrived at the hospital with Red Lobster takeout she had bought the night before. She wanted to make up for the Saturday night dinner she had missed.\n\nThe next hours were a mix of happiness, anger and sadness.\n\nAs the contractions came on, Ms. Sanchez joked with friends and family and yelled at her husband on the phone. Sometimes, she joked with him, too. \u201cIt\u2019s going down, but not in the DM though,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said, laughing as she referred to Yo Gotti\u2019s hit about online flirting, \u201cDown in the DM.\u201d\n\nHer sister, Chanell Brown, 29, was in awe. \u201cAre you in labor? The reason I\u2019m asking \u2014 you\u2019re on the phone and in labor. That\u2019s gangster,\u201d she said.\n\nThen Ms. Brown began crying uncontrollably, wiping tears from her face. A month earlier, she too had moved into a city shelter with her 2-year-old daughter. And she was pregnant again. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m struggling more now with a kid,\u201d she told her sister.\n\nThat night, Ms. Brown wanted to witness the birth of her nephew, but she was worried about missing the shelter\u2019s 10 p.m. curfew. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave, but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou have got to do what you have to do, Chanell,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said. \u201cYou have to get it together, mama. You have no control over this moment. You have to be, like, \u2018This is something I\u2019m doing for me and my baby.\u2019 You have to think of the outcome when you\u2019re able to walk into your own house.\u201d\n\nMs. Sanchez told her that some day they would both be out of shelters, and their children would spend the night at each other\u2019s houses.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after Ms. Brown left that Ms. Sanchez gave birth.\n\nShe nestled Antonio close to her breasts to feed him. Mr. Sanchez took off his tank top and laid Antonio to his bare, tattooed chest. \u201cHe\u2019s so small,\u201d he said, smiling and glossy-eyed.\n\nHomeless children are more at risk of returning to homelessness as adults.\n\nBringing the new baby \u2018home\u2019\n\nTwo days later, Ms. Sanchez took Antonio to the shelter. Right away she spotted what was missing and what had been added to the room. She had asked the staff for a portable air conditioner, which was not there. But there were two identical cribs that resembled shopping carts in the middle of the room, side by side. \u201cI didn\u2019t have twins,\u201d she said, shaking her head.\n\nHer husband was out looking for work. \u201cStop telling me you need to stay out to make a few more dollars,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said to him on the telephone.\n\n\u201cI need you here.\u201d\n\nSomeone had taped a flier about safe sleep for babies on a wall.\n\nA maintenance worker knocked on the door and took away the extra crib.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the baby\u2019s name?\u201d the worker asked Ms. Sanchez.\n\n\u201cAntonio,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my middle name,\u201d the worker said.\n\nAs Antonio lay on a bottom bunk, between two pillows, Ms. Sanchez cleaned up. She cleaned out the refrigerator. She sorted through clothes donated by friends and some she had bought at Cookie\u2019s Kids.\n\nShe folded baby blankets and onesies. (More supplies, including a different crib, would arrive later with the help of Win, the largest provider of family shelter in the city.)\n\n\u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d played on a small television atop a dresser. It was the episode in which Lionel Jefferson, the son of a wealthy businessman who owned laundromats, and his fianc\u00e9e called off their wedding after arguing over a prenuptial agreement. At the end of the episode, the couple made up.\n\nMs. Sanchez laughed. If only her real life were as easy. If only her family lived in \u201ca deluxe apartment in the sky.\u201d\n\nShe rocked Antonio and kissed him until he fell asleep, limp in her arms. In about a month, she announced, she planned to return to work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure before you turn 1 we\u2019re out of here. All of us,\u201d she told a sleeping Antonio. \u201cWe\u2019ll bust out together.\u201d", "description": "When he left the hospital, he joined 11,233 other children under 6 living in New York City\u2019s shelter system.", "authors": ["Nikita Stewart", "Gabriella Angotti-Jones"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/04/nyregion/04bornhomelessPROMO2/04bornhomelessPROMO2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-30"}
