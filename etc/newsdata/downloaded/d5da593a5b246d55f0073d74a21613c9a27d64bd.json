Then, as Connecticut Sun guard Courtney Williams commandeered the emcee\u2019s microphone, closed her eyes and roared, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d her fans obeyed and unleashed a torrent of noise. Still, Delle Donne kept talking, and the Mystics huddled around her were listening.\n\nIn the quiet of the locker room, the words weren\u2019t loud, but they were confident.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey tried to push it to Game 5. That\u2019s what they did. Now our season is on the line, too,\u201d guard Natasha Cloud said. \u201cBut if you ask me, I\u2019ll take our team 10 times out of 10.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Mystics can look back at Game 4 and see traces of their dominance \u2014 including coming back from 18 points down in the first quarter \u2014 before they make any guarantees, the players should also notice the problematic reasons that there will be a Game 5 on Thursday night in Southeast Washington.\n\nFor one, the Sun took advantage of the Mystics\u2019 hacking defenders. In the opening quarter, Sun shooters walked to the free throw line after three of the Mystics\u2019 first four fouls. And during a game played in a casino, the home team made 23 of 26 foul shots; Washington was 10 for 13. When the disparity is that big, the house always wins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlso, Connecticut forced a winner-take-all game because it again proved to be the better rebounding team. Center Jonquel Jones secured a game-high 13, besting the combined efforts of four Mystics starters.\n\nOf course, three of those players \u2014 Delle Donne, Kristi Toliver and Ariel Atkins \u2014 have played on despite injuries. Toliver took another beating by colliding with Jones in the second quarter. Already playing with a brace on her right knee, Toliver slowly got up and held her lower back. The injury didn\u2019t force her out and Toliver still logged 33 minutes, but she finished with only seven points and five assists \u2014 a significant drop from her 20-and-10 performance in Game 3.\n\nThe swing in Toliver\u2019s production wasn\u2019t the only anomaly.\n\nAD\n\nIn the first half, the Mystics stumbled into an 18-point deficit on plays such as Sun forward Alyssa Thomas scoring over Cloud in the paint, then staring her down for good measure. Still, that didn\u2019t seem too jarring, considering Thomas stands two inches taller than the Mystics guard, so she better be able to back down a smaller player into oblivion.\n\nAD\n\nThe game still hadn\u2019t gone off the rails when forward Shekinna Stricklen shouted and pumped her fists while celebrating her two three-pointers within the first five minutes. Although Stricklen has mostly been off the mark this series, missing 5 of 6 deep shots in Game 1, she possesses a career 37.5 percentage and knows how to shoot from the perimeter.\n\nNo, the moment when Tuesday entered \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d \u2014 and the first sign that the Mystics wouldn\u2019t be spraying champagne in the visitors\u2019 locker room \u2014 was when Delle Donne missed a free throw. The player who had set a league record by hitting 97.4 percent (114 of 117) and had made 18 of 19 in the playoffs threw up a dud with 1:15 left in the first quarter.\n\nAD\n\nAt that point, the Mystics were down 30-14, but they still didn\u2019t lose grip of the game. By the fourth, Washington had taken a slight lead and in the final 94 seconds it still had opportunities to steal the night. With the Sun leading 87-86, Washington had three scoring chances and couldn\u2019t convert.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe also had a few open shots that we didn\u2019t hit,\u201d guard Aerial Powers said. \u201cI mean, the ball movement was there, but we didn\u2019t hit a few shots. I honestly feel that way. We just have to be better come Thursday.\u201d\n\nThe Mystics must wait one more day to put those words into action.\n\nRead more on the Washington Mystics:\n\nAD", "description": "A bad start to Game 4 led to a raucous rally that fell just short.
