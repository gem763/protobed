Two Hollywood heavyweights are now representing diametrically opposed political views on a very large stage indeed. That would be Jon Voight and Robert De Niro, both vocal and passionate about their beliefs on a regular basis.\n\nMr. Voight, an Academy Award winning actor, has offered his eloquent support for conservatives and Republicans for years, appearing on cable news and in person at tea party rallies and other events. He has also recorded succinct and effective videos in support of President Trump, posted online and often highlighted in major news coverage. Mr. Voight remains a powerful influence on the news cycle, and has done so for a decade.\n\nThen there is another outspoken Oscar-winning actor. That would be Mr. De Niro, who also makes his political views known and well-covered in his own style, which involves lots of f-bombs plus appearances on such shows as \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nNow comes a study which has determined that liberal media bias even extends into the world of Hollywood.\n\n\u201cCNN media guys love Robert De Niro\u2019s profane \u2018passion,\u2019 and they pity Jon Voight\u2019s \u2018indoctrination,\u2019\u201d writes Tim Graham, executive editor of Newsbusters.org and director of analysis for the Media Research Center.\n\nFollowing Mr. De Niro\u2019s recent appearance on CNN, Mr. Graham recalls that \u201cReliable Sources\u201d host Brian Stelter only \u201cweakly protested\u201d the actor\u2019s signature profanity, which is \u201cratings bait for his Trump-hating base.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham also cited a passage from Mr. Stelter\u2019s latest newsletter, which noted that the overwhelming reaction from viewers suggested they \u201cappreciated De Niro\u2019s passion.\u201d The same newsletter would only pity Mr. Voight\u2019s commentary for a public \u201cGod bless Trump\u201d video.\n\n\u201cNobody at CNN is appreciating Voight\u2019s passion,\u201d Mr. Graham observes.\n\nThat includes Oliver Darcy, CNN\u2019s chief media reporter.\n\n\u201cI noticed a disturbing video of actor Jon Voight commenting on the Ukraine scandal go viral. In the video, Voight expresses his extreme loyalty to Trump and parrots claims made by people like Hannity and Limbaugh. While many were shocked, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sad for Voight. The clip showed exactly what it looks like to be indoctrinated and caught in the pro-Trump media universe,\u201d Mr. Darcy wrote in the aforementioned newsletter.\n\nYes, well. Mr. Graham is right in his observations. There are two standards for judging the two accomplished actors, and in the liberal media, the analysts are not kind to Mr. Voight.\n\nAMERICANS WARY OF SOCIAL MEDIA \u2018NEWS\u2019\n\nThe social media realm appears to be failing as a serious news provider for the public. Almost two-thirds of Americans now say that social media providers have \u201ctoo much control over the news\u201d and favor certain news organization according to a major Pew Research Center analysis.\n\n\u201cAbout 8-in-10 U.S. adults (82%) say social media sites treat some news organizations differently than others, about five times the share saying all news organizations are treated the same (16%),\u201d the analysis said.\n\nThe respondents say one ideology in particular is the social media pet: 48% of Americans said the social media sites post news with a liberal slant; 36% said the posts were moderate in content and 15% said they were conservative. Another 89% think social media companies \u201ccontrol the mix of stories people see\u201d while 90% think \u201ccensorship of the news\u201d is a problem.\n\nThe research also found that 83% of Americans said \u201cone-sided news\u201d was a problem, 81% cited inaccurate news, and 69% were critical of \u201ccensorship of the news.\u201d Another 53% were troubled when news organization or personalities were banned from social media sites.\n\nOver half of the public \u2014 54% \u2014 now get news from social media, up 7 percentage points in the last year. In addition, 62% of all Americans say the sites have too much control; that includes 75% of Republicans and even 53% of Democrats. Overall, 55% of Americans say that social media companies\u2019 efforts to direct what news people see makes matters worse; that includes 66% of Republicans and 49% of Democrats.\n\nFind more in the Poll du Jour at column\u2019s end.\n\nON THE MUST-HAVE LIST\n\nAttention: President Trump\u2019s campaign has just released a limited-edition, heroic and classy campaign poster of Mr. Trump as he would appear midflight, Superman style, but in his customary red tie and dark suit. It features a shining logo reading \u201cKeep America Great,\u201d the president\u2019s easily recognizable signature, plus a silver \u201c2020\u201d and a refined superhero style. It\u2019s pretty nice art, actually.\n\nThe poster is priced at $24, was produced in the U.S., is individually hand numbered and is available through DonaldJTrump.com under the \u201cShop\u201d tab.\n\nDOWN TO EIGHT\n\nThere are still eight Democrats who have not jumped on the Trump impeachment train. Curious? They are: Reps. Anthony Brindisi of New York, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Collin Peterson of Minnesota, Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico, and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.\n\nIt is a tricky business for the lawmakers in their home district.\n\nRep. Ben McAdams of Utah did not side with impeachment until Friday, when he flipped his opinion during a town hall meeting in his state.\n\n\u201cMcAdams, 44, represents a district that favors Republicans in voter registration by 13 points, though it\u2019s long been politically competitive. Since joining the House in January, after defeating Republican incumbent Mia Love in 2018, McAdams has steered a centrist course, particularly shunning impeachment talk,\u201d writes David Mark, deputy news editor of The Washington Examiner.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 89% of Americans say social media companies control the mix of news people see.\n\n\u2022 88% of Americans say the sites favor news organizations which offer \u201cattention grabbing articles.\u201d\n\n\u2022 84% say the sites favor news organizations with a lot of social media followers.\n\n\u2022 79% say the companies favor coverage with \u201ca certain political stance.\u201d\n\n\u2022 56% say the sites favor \u201cwell established\u201d news organizations.\n\n\u2022 34% say they favor organizations with \u201chigh reporting standards.\u201d\n\nSource: A Pew Research Center poll of 5,107 U.S. adults conducted JULY 8-21 and released Friday.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
