The Berlin prosecutor\u2019s office has described him as \u201cbehaving like a professional\u201d.\n\nThe journalists\u2019 investigation has found there is no one registered in the Russian passport records office as Vadim Sokolov. In addition, the address in his Schengen area visa application is false. His passport was found to have been issued by a department of the Russian interior ministry, which has in the past been responsible for issuing passports for agents of the Russian military secret service, the GRU, the journalists say.\n\nThey claim they have also found evidence in a Russian database of attempts to create a credible false identity under the name Sokolov, shortly before the murder. The procedure recorded there is similar to that found during the Bellingcat exposure of the identity of the alleged Skripal attacker. Sokolov was also registered in the Russian tax database in June 2016, when he would have been 49, despite the fact that Russian citizens are registered as taxpayers as soon as they start work, the journalists found.\n\nOnly days after receiving a tax number and a Russian passport, he applied for a Schengen area visa at the French embassy, according to the investigation. Sokolov was not to be found at the address with which he registered with the tax office.\n\nOn Thursday, the New York Times reported claims that Sokolov may in fact be Vadim Andreevich Stepanov, a convicted murderer.\n\nBut the team of investigative journalists, with the help of forensic experts at Bradford University, have found no match between photographs of the suspect and Stepanov. There are also reports that Stepanov is in prison.\n\nKhangoshvili fought in the second Chechen war against Russia. He later worked for several years as an informant and negotiator for the Georgian and Ukrainian counter-terrorist authorities. Following numerous threats and an assassination attempt on him, he moved to Ukraine and then fled to Germany where he sought asylum.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied any involvement in his killing.", "description": "Police have compared shooting of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili to attack on Sergei Skripal", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fb46e3dab4da174aa8a44b23a24efdf9becd786/0_162_612_367/master/612.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5f1549090eece1167a3d362fecba4eb", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
