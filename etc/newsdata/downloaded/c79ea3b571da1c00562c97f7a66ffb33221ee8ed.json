And if there are any geography or French teachers reading this, please don't write a furious letter. No, I don't mean La Loire.\n\nLa Loire is France's longest river. It runs from the coastal west to the mountainous south, and boasts a verdant landscape of fabulous chateaux and superb vineyards.\n\nThis is about Le Loir, a much quieter chap, happy to meander for a mere 200 miles in rural obscurity through gentle, mid-west countryside. But given a choice between La and Le, I would go with Le.\n\nThe village of La Fleche sits in a pleasant spot on the banks of Le Loir river\n\nLe Loir is actually a tributary of the Sarthe river. But the Loir Valley - just to keep things nice and confusing - runs 25 miles to the north, seemingly trickling along in its shadow.\n\nI found the Loir region by motoring north from Bordeaux on the A10 and A28 autoroutes just before Le Mans. And after that long, hot drive, it was a relief to pull into the main square of La Chartre-sur-le-Loir.\n\nIt's a classic of the provincial French variety: five caf\u00e9s, pretty but unpretentious, three-storey, cream-coloured houses, the usual boulangeries and charcuteries, all straight out of the illustrations in a Beginner's French textbook.\n\nThe Hotel de France in La Chartre-sur-le-Loir is popular with Le Mans racegoers\n\nAn elderly Englishman strode across the square. I didn't actually ask him his nationality, but he was wearing red trousers, a Panama hat and had just stepped out of a vintage Jaguar. He was heading to the Hotel de France, which was another giveaway. If Le Loir has a small claim to fame, it's this hotel.\n\nWe are an hour from Le Mans and its day-night racetrack. The Hotel de France, with its Art Deco facade, is a place of pilgrimage for the drivers and their fans: Le Mans competitors once used to prepare their cars in the hotel courtyard. And the room names are quite a starting grid: Jacky Ickx, Jochen Rindt, Bruce McLaren, Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart.\n\nAs for the rest of La Chartre, it's of more interest to people with a passion for old teapots than torque. There are half a dozen antiques shops straddling the main street and clustering close to the rose-festooned bridge.\n\nThe spectacular gardens of the Hotel Chateau du Grand-Luce in the Loir valley\n\nHow long Le Loir will remain a 'secret bien gard\u00e9' (as its website calls it), I wonder, because something glamorous is certainly happening here.\n\nWe drove to the hilltop village of Le Grand-Luc\u00e9 to find out. It's not a big village, so we got to know its narrow streets pretty well, before locating a plain-looking gate that leads to the Hotel Ch\u00e2teau du Grand-Luc\u00e9.\n\nCh\u00e2teau du Grand-Luc\u00e9 was built in 1764 for Jacques Pineau de Viennay, Baron de Luc\u00e9, in the 18th-century heyday of French classicism. His daughter, Louise, hosted Voltaire, Mozart and Rousseau - and many townspeople took shelter there after a fire devastated the village in 1781.\n\nNow, after service as a wartime hospital and government offices, and a highly respectful renovation by American interior designer, Timothy Corrigan, the Grand-Luc\u00e9 has just been reopened as a chic resort.\n\nThe 18th-century Hotel Chateau has a pool set among the sculpted gardens\n\nBeyond its walls, you can see the other source of what I'll call (for want of a better word) Le Loir's fame: 'trees'.\n\nThe vertiginously tall oaks of the Berc\u00e9 forest were planted to make the floors at the Palace of Versailles and to provide timber for naval ships.\n\nThe 5,400 hectares are fantastic for cycling or strolling on a hot day.\n\nLe Berce Forest is perfect for a quiet stroll or a picnic on the banks of the river\n\nTrees are celebrated, dissected and explained in a quirky little Carnuta forest museum in the village of Jupilles. But 'quirky' doesn't begin to describe the work of octogenarian artist Thierry Juge in his converted 14th-century priory on the outskirts of Beaumont-sur-Deme.\n\nHis garden and the steeply sloping hills beyond are full of box hedges. But these are not boxes that match. Juge's art consists of his shaping the buxus, not into the birds and balls of classic topiary art, but a bewildering variety of abstract shapes.\n\nWe spend a merry 30 minutes walking around the grounds, having cloudspotter-style disagreements: 'That one looks like a mushroom.' 'No, it's a poodle!' Dinner was a marked contrast to the Grand-Luc\u00e9. Les M\u00e8res Cocottes is a grocery shop that blends somewhat chaotically into a restaurant. On the hidden terrace, d d b fl d surrounded by sunflowers and vines, we feasted on d\u00e9lices de la mer and trout, and perche \u00e0 la Proven\u00e7ale for about \u00a318.\n\nIn case you are suffering from chateau withdrawal, the Loir does, in fact, have an outstanding one: Ch\u00e2teau du Lude. But we were just as happy to be surrounded by the natural architecture of the forests and the low-key delights of a France at its least showy.", "description": "Mark Jones discovered that Le Loir is France at its least showy - a world of pretty cafes, boulangeries and charcuteries straight out of the illustrations in a Beginner's French textbook.", "authors": ["Mark Jones For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/17/18926396-0-image-a-7_1569429385481.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
