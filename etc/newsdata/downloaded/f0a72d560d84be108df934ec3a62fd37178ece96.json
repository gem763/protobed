Add Interest\n\nThe show also surprised favorites like \"Veep\" and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" to claim the award for best comedy.\n\n\"It's the thing that dreams are made of,\" she said backstage of her show's success. \"To share a stage with them marks a huge moment for me in my life, and doing it with such great friends and collaborators is just wonderful.\"\n\nHowever, those who aren't familiar with her critically acclaimed series, which was distributed in the United States by Amazon, may have wondered who she was.\n\nHere's a primer.\n\n1. She's a playwright: \"Fleabag\" began as an award-winning one-woman show, and Waller-Bridge told Vulture that her character, a woman mourning the loss of a friend, was born out of a challenge from a friend to do a 10-minute performance for a storytelling night.\n\n\"It\u2019s terrifying, but having accepted the challenge I thought, you know, I\u2019ve never played, as an actress, I\u2019ve never played a part that\u2019s just shamelessly dangerous as a woman, and she\u2019s like, 'I know I\u2019m dangerous. I know I\u2019m naughty. I know I\u2019m massively broken.' But she\u2019s going to let it all hang out,\" Waller-Bridge said. \"I knew I wanted play something that was in that area, and somebody who was unapologetic about desperately needing sex and affirmation. Also the need to keep moving. She\u2019s moving the whole way through -- she\u2019s not going to stop because then the tragedy will land on her. I wanted that feeling.\"\n\nAnd yes, she added, she does identify with Fleabag (whose name is never revealed).\n\n2. 'Fleabag' is in her past: \"Fleabag\" had just two seasons, and despite pleas for more, Waller-Bridge has sworn up and down that it's over.\n\n\"This just feels like the most beautiful way to say goodbye to it,\" she said backstage at the Emmys. \"It does feel like the story is complete.\"\n\n3. She's a TV aficionado: At just 34 years old, Waller-Bridge has already created two television shows in addition to \"Fleabag\": \"Crashing\" and \"Killing Eve,\" which also picked up an Emmy on Sunday night. She has a fourth show, \"Run,\" in the works for HBO.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the series is about former lovers who made a pact more than a decade prior that if one texted \"RUN\" to the other, they would run away together.\n\n4. You've seen (and heard!) her in films: Waller-Bridge is best known for her work on the small screen, but she's also been in movies, including \"The Iron Lady\" and \"Goodbye Christopher Robin.\" She lent her voice to L3-37, Lando's droid pal, in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story,\" too.\n\n5. 007 is in her hands: Waller-Bridge wrote the next James Bond movie, \"No Time to Die,\" which will premiere next year.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
