Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Secretary of Commerce threatened to fire top employees at the federal scientific agency responsible for weather forecasts last Friday after the agency\u2019s Birmingham office contradicted President Trump\u2019s claim that Hurricane Dorian might hit Alabama, according to three peopl e familiar with the discussion.\n\nThat threat led to an unusual, unsigned statement later that Friday by the agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, disavowing the National Weather Service\u2019s position that Alabama was not at risk. The reversal caused widespread anger within the agency and drew accusations from the scientific community that the National Weather Service, which is part of NOAA, had been bent to political purposes.\n\nNOAA\u2019s statement on Friday is now being examined by the Commerce Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times , and employees have been asked to preserve their files . NOAA is a division of the Commerce Department.\n\nThe National Weather Service \u201cmust maintain standards of scientific integrity,\u201d the inspector general, Peggy E. Gustafson, wrote in a message to NOAA staff members in which she requested documents related to Friday\u2019s statement. The circumstances, she wrote, \u201ccall into question the NWS\u2019s processes, scientific independence, and ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency.\u201d", "description": "Wilbur L.
