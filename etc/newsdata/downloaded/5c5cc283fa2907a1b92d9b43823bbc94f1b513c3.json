But after the trade dispute erupted, farm exports to China dropped 53% in 2018 and were down another 8% for the first seven months of 2019.\n\nChina has compensated by increasing purchases of wheat and soybeans from neighboring Russia, which now hopes to double agricultural exports to China over 10 years. Australia and Brazil \u201csignificantly\u201d increased their share of China\u2019s cotton market, according to the report. Brazil raised pork exports to China and is moving to authorize dozens of new meat-processing facilities.\n\nLikewise, Brazil has been slowly displacing the U.S. in soybean sales to China and is now the nation\u2019s top supplier, the report found.\n\nThe analysis was done by six consultants at Boston Consulting Group, including Decker Walker, the firm\u2019s global head of agribusiness, and Michael McAdoo, associate director of global trade at the firm.", "description": "U.S. Farms Face Long-Term Losses From Trump Trade War, BCG Warns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice2cf6d6b2b94c122831037531f97b9d3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
