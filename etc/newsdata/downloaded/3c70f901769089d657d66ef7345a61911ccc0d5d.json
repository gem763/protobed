Celeste Joy Diaz, a recruiting manager at Amazon. Courtesy of Celeste Joy Diaz\n\nBut Celeste Joy Diaz, a recruiting manager at Amazon, said there's a right way to talk about yourself \u2014 and quite a few ways to mess it up.\n\nFor starters, you can't just name drop the company or your job title. That doesn't give any perspective on what you did every day.\n\nProviding a rundown of your entire job description also doesn't quite work.\n\n\"We know that our candidates have done a lot of things, but we really want to know, 'what does that mean,'\" Diaz told Business Insider.\n\n\n\nCareer experts like executive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writer and career strategist Adrienne Tom agree. You can't just state your job title, company, or your daily tasks and expect recruiters to be impressed by you \u2014 or even understand what it is that you do.\n\n\"A job title alone is not enough to clarify personal value, complexity of skill set, or breadth of expertise,\" Tom previously told Business Insider. \"What matters most in a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will be the results that each individual has generated within their roles, regardless of title or rank.\"\n\nDelete the laundry list of your daily tasks from your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 and use this phrase instead\n\n\"Titles are great, but we want to understand what was the project you owned, what was the scope of a project, and what did you accomplish,\" Diaz said. \"The best is when it's grounded in data.\"\n\nAnd to truly win over Amazon recruiters like Diaz, specify with numbers the value you brought to your company. Diaz told Business Insider that this is a winning phrase:\n\nI created a solution for X amount of customers and it saved X amount of money, using X skill.\n\nThis is a great phrase to include in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because it communicates the financial benefit you bring to a company. And bringing in more money is exactly why someone would want to hire you.\n\nNot every role has a clear financial output (unlike positions in, say, sales), but any professional can put their successes into numbers.\n\nI'm a journalist who doesn't know how much revenue I drive, but I would still be able to implement this. In a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I write something like: \"I wrote X number of articles a week, attracting X amount of unique views each month.\"\n\nYou could also write how you exceeded your goals, how many projects you started or led, the size of your team or client base, or how many new clients you garnered.\n\n\"No position is exempt from measuring results,\" Tina Nicolai, executive career coach and founder of R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Writers' Ink , previously told Business Insider. \"And metrics help employers determine if a person is capable of leading a team, managing clients, or growing the business.\"", "description": "Getting a job at\u00a0Amazon\u00a0means your\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u00a0needs to shine.
