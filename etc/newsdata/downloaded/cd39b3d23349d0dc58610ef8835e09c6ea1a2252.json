Lindsey Graham says a deal on red flag laws is imminent. And the White House has briefed senators on what options are on the table.\n\nBut everyone is still waiting on one person: President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate left Tuesday evening with no clear indication of what the next steps would be on gun legislation, in the aftermath of several mass shootings during the August recess.

Toomey (R-Pa.) and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) that would alert local authorities if people fail background checks and crackdowns on straw purchases.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
