Advanced Cyber Security Corp, Corsa, CyberArk, Cybereason, DFLabs, Crowdstrike, Electric Power Research Institute, EclecticIQ, Fortinet, Indegy, New Context, ReversingLabs, SafeBreach, Syncurity, Threat Quotient, and Tufin have all joined.\n\nSee also: Chameleon gambling apps wiped from App Store, Google Play\n\nKnown as the Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA), each company will lend cybersecurity resources -- whether threat insight, code, or expertise -- in a bid to \"develop open source security technologies which can freely exchange information, insights, analytics, and\n\norchestrated responses.\"\n\nOCA will focus on the development of open source content, code, tooling, practices, and patterns for improving the interoperability of cybersecurity solutions. In addition, the firms will work on ways to bolster information sharing across vendors and their product lines.\n\nCNET: Renewed calls for backdoor access to encryption have all the same flaws\n\nIt is hoped that by encouraging companies to adopt open source options able to integrate standalone products effectively, the enterprise will benefit through visibility improvements, the reduction of vendor lock-in, and increased data sharing.\n\nTwo projects are already in full swing. IBM Security's STIX-Shifter is a project dedicated to the development of a search function for cybersecurity products through an open source, standardized cybersecurity data model and library (STIX 2).\n\nThe second, contributed by McAfee, is an interoperable messaging format supported by the OpenDXL messaging bus, due to be launched under an Apache 2.0 license.\n\nTechRepublic: How to protect your organization against insider threats\n\n\"Today, organizations struggle without a standard language when sharing data between products and tools,\" said Carol Geyer, chief development officer of OASIS. \"We have seen efforts emerge to foster data exchange, but what has been missing is the ability for each tool to transmit and receive these messages in a standardized format, resulting in more expensive and time-consuming integration costs. The aim of the OCA is to accelerate the open sharing concept making it easier for enterprises to manage and operate.\"\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
