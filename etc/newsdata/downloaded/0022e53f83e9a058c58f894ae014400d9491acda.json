Castro and Biden were clashing over how Americans would become insured under various health-care proposals, and Castro argued Biden was contradicting what he said. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago?\u201d he asked Biden.\n\nSee: Is Trump making older people look bad?\n\nCastro, 44, later said he was not referring to 76-year-old Biden\u2019s age. \u201cThat was not a personal attack,\u201d Castro said on CNN Friday morning.\n\nSome viewers, however, believed it was ageist. David Axelrod, a former Obama adviser, said the former U.S. secretary \u201coverreached.\u201d \u201cIt was such an overt kind of sort,\u201d he said. Jack Kupferman, president of the Gray Panthers, a New York City-based anti-aging group, said the comment was ageist, and that this is a recurring theme \u2014 not just on the political stage, but in society. \u201cYou have to look at the individual, not at the age,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many people do you know who are 40 years old that are forgetful and yet competent?\u201d\n\nCastro WENT THERE on Biden\u2019s age and the Obama legacy. \u2014 Ed O'Keefe (@edokeefe) September 13, 2019\n\nYou have not seen Biden speak very often. Take him off of teleprompter, this is how he talks. Age has nothing to do with it. Except for the ageist.\n\n\n\nIt is amusing to me that the most ageist of all are those who are saying Castro was ageist. \u2014 Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) September 13, 2019\n\nCastro made a fool of himself with this silly personal attack. He needs to go. We should hear more from \u2066@ewarren\u2069 and others who focus on policy and on Trump. https://t.co/N1WCd9yLtm \u2014 Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) September 13, 2019\n\nCory Booker, a New Jersey Senator running for president, said to CNN after the debate that Biden did make references that could age him, such as people listening to record players. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time I saw a record player,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you don\u2019t wonder...\u201d He followed up that these instances don\u2019t make Biden unqualified to be president.\n\nPOST-DEBATE SHOT FROM @CORYBOOKER: \u201cThere are definitely moments where you listen to @JoeBiden, & you just wonder...\u201d pic.twitter.com/rHx4aioHNb \u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) September 13, 2019\n\nFellow candidate Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota senator, told CNN the dig was \u201cnot cool.\u201d \u201cI thought that was so personal and so unnecessary,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Thursday debate featured the top 10 Democratic presidential candidates: Biden, Booker, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Amy Klobucher, Andrew Yang and Julian Castro. Three of the frontrunners are 70 or older (Warren turned 70 this year, and Sanders\u2019 78th birthday was last week). President Donald Trump is 73.\n\nAlso see: This bipartisan proposal aims to end age discrimination for a graying workforce\n\nThese candidates\u2019 ages might be a critical factor in some voters\u2019 final decisions, as it was for past politicians. When Bob Dole, the former Republican Senate minority leader, ran for president in 1996 at the age of 73, he fell off the stage \u2014 causing many people to think it was because he was too old and weak. Current candidates aren\u2019t showing many signs of aging, but on social media, future voters have weighed their options and expressed their concerns of an older person taking office in 2020.\n\nAgeism against political candidates won\u2019t go away until it\u2019s dealt with in society, Kupferman said. And as it stands, ageism is ingrained in most Americans. People may believe this prejudice is hard-wired, and that generations are naturally segregated by their age, but that\u2019s simply not true, Ashton Applewhite, author of \u201cThis Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism,\u201d wrote in a blog post. \u201cThere is nothing acceptable about any group being isolated or silenced against their wishes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe wrong lies in giving any kind of discrimination a pass.\u201d", "description": "The problem with ageism is that it\u2019s ingrained in society", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR296_bidena_ZG_20190913145344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
