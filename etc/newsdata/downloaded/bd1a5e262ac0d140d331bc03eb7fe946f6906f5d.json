The rule is named after Dan Rooney, the late former Pittsburgh Steelers owner who also chaired the league\u2019s diversity committee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs a pension system, we want to invest in 21st century companies that represent the future \u2014 not companies with management teams that look like they\u2019re out of the 1950s,\u201d Stringer said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the business world to embrace these reforms that will lead to decades of progress.\u201d\n\nStringer\u2019s office said the companies have yet to adopt Rooney-type search policies for boards or CEO positions, based on his review.\n\nOther companies \u2014 such as Facebook, Amazon and Costco Warehouse \u2014 have adopted such policies at the board level, at times in response to investor pressure.\n\nStringer\u2019s office said about two dozen of the 56 companies appear to have no minorities on their board.\n\nAD\n\nThe new campaign is the third phase of an effort to improve the accountability and diversity of corporate boards, a statement from Stringer\u2019s office said. In 2014, his office launched a campaign to give investors more power to nominate directors, a process known as \u201cproxy access.\u201d More than 600 companies have since adopted proxy access.\n\nAD\n\nStringer has also pushed to get boards to disclose in a matrix format more details about directors\u2019 experience and demographic background.\n\nThe office is likely to issue shareholder proposals for next year\u2019s proxy season for companies that do not adopt the policy, according to Stringer\u2019s office. Investors vote on such proposals during annual meeting season and companies can decide whether to implement them \u2014 but the vote often generates additional, and sometimes unwanted, attention for the company.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible many companies will argue they already interview minority or female candidates for these jobs and that an official policy is not needed.\n\nIn an email, Walmart said four out of its 12 board members, or 33 percent, were diverse. \u201cWe believe that a board comprised of directors with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives and viewpoints improves the dialogue and decision-making in the board room and contributes to overall Board effectiveness,\u201d the email said.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear how investors would hold companies accountable for sticking to the rule. Given the incredibly private nature of board and CEO searches, it\u2019s unclear what consequences companies would face if they adopted such a policy but didn\u2019t follow through, or how shareholders would even know if they didn\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is about changing market practice and ensuring that diversity is front-and-center in leadership searches around the country,\u201d Stringer said in an emailed statement. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see real change in companies with persistent lack of diversity, then we\u2019ll vote against the board nominating committees.\u201d\n\nAmong Russell 3000 companies \u2014 an index that represents most publicly traded companies on major U.S. stock exchanges \u2014 just 20 percent of board seats are held by women, according to the research firm Equilar. The percentage is higher among the largest U.S. firms, with 27 percent of S&P 500 company board seats held by women as of July. A study by Deloitte and the Alliance for Board Diversity said total minority representation among Fortune 500 board seats was 16.1 percent in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, women make up just 5 percent of the chief executive jobs among the S&P 500. Only four current Fortune 500 CEOs \u2014 fewer than 1 percent \u2014 are black, and none of those four are women, according to a report released Thursday by the executive search firm Korn Ferry.\n\nRead also:\n\nAD", "description": "About two dozen of the 56 companies on Stringer's list appear to have no minorities on their board.", "authors": ["Jena Mcgregor", "Reporter Covering Leadership Issues In The Headlines"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x-QoHszVarIpz_r1lpAkZGp7zP8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S2UFWBHMEUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
