The Food Safety Information Council has given a brief list of when people should be washing and drying their hands: 1) Before handling, preparing and eating food 2) After touching raw meat, fish, shell eggs or poultry 3) After using the toilet, attending to children\u2019s (or others) toiletting and changing nappies 4) After blowing your nose 5) After touching a pet 6) After gardening\n\nYoung people were also less likely to wash their hands after visiting the bathroom compared to older people.\n\nOnly 69 per cent of people under the age of 34 followed good hygiene practice while 86 per cent of people over 50 washed their hands.\n\nThe same trend was seen food preparation, with only 59 per cent of young people washing their hands before handling food compared to 63 per cent of older people.\n\n'Poor handwashing knowledge among young people is also a concern as they often become professional food handlers,' Ms Buchtmann said.\n\nThe FSIC recommended people to wash and dry their hands in at least six different scenarios: before handling food, after touching raw meat and after touching a pet, to name a few.\n\nThe council even gave a breakdown of how people should be washing their hands.\n\nPeople should wet and rub their hands together to build up a good lather of soap, rinse them under water and dry them on a clean towel for at least 20 seconds.\n\nTouching a surface with wet hands could facilitate the spread of germs.\n\nOnly 76 per cent of men washed their hands after visiting the bathroom compared to 86 per cent of women (stock image)\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Food Safety Information Council (FSIC) released the information on Wednesday, which showed Australian men were worst offenders than women.", "authors": ["Aidan Wondracz For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20059982-0-image-a-2_1571786099123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
