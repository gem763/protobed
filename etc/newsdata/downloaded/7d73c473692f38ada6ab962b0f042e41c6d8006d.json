The report found that those investigations largely centered on individuals or groups motivated by anti-government ideologies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe report showed that incidents against employees ranged from telephoned threats to attempted murder. For example, one listed threat included an individual who attempted to murder a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) law enforcement officer with a firearm, while another incident involved an employee who was stabbed outside a federal building. Other threats include ones posted on YouTube and Facebook, the report found.\n\nThe GAO warned that the calculation of threats and assaults on federal land officials was likely much higher, due to the likelihood many instances were not reported or that they were reported to state or local law enforcement but not shared with agency law enforcement officers.\n\nThe watchdog recommended that the federal government must do more to protect its employees but found that agencies largely blamed lacking resources for an inability to further assess security needs.\n\nRead more about the report's warnings here.\n\nHappy Monday!
