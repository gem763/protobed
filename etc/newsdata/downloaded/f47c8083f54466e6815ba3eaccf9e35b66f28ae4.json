Adam Schiff (D-CA) in which they accuse him of \u201cwithholding the existence\u201d of documents as part of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe highly irregular manner in which you are conducting your so-called \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019 gravely concerns us, as does the fact that you have decreed this matter to bee under HPSCI\u2019s jurisdiction despite it lacking any clear intelligence component,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cFurther, given that you have recently acknowledged that the Committee no longer needs to receive testimony from the whistleblower, your \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019 lacks any relationship with the jurisdiction of this Committee.\u201d\n\nNEW: @HouseIntel Republicans penned a letter to @RepAdamSchiff for withholding existence of #impeachment related documents from the GOP members & their staff pic.twitter.com/uRl85F1bTF \u2014 Brooke Singman (@brookefoxnews) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, the Committee was established to conduct crucial oversight of the Intelligence Comunity, and we are increasingly concerns about normal work is being overlooked in favor of partisan activities best suited for another Committee, the lawmakers added.\n\nThe letter is signed by Reps. Devin Nunes (D-CA), Michael Conaway (R-TX), Michael Turner (R-OH), Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Chris Stewart (R-UT), Rick Crawford (R-AR), Elise Stefanik (R-NY), Will Hurd (R-TX), and John Ratcliffe (R-TX).\n\nThe letter comes as House Republicans are preparing to vote Monday on censuring Schiff over his handling of the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cWhat I have found with Adam Schiff is that three times to the American public he has lied,\u201d House Minority Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said during a Friday press conference.\n\n\u201cWhen you serve on the intelligence committee, it\u2019s different than any other committee in the House because you will read and gather information that members of the House can\u2019t have knowledge,\u201d added McCarthy. \u201cSo, when a member of the intelligence committee speaks about something, we hold them to a higher standard.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday, nearly two-thirds (123) of House Republicans back House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs\u2019 (R-AZ) resolution to condemn the California Democrat.\n\nSchiff set off a political firestorm for recounting a fictional call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a recent committee hearing regarding a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint about the call. He also made false statements about his panel having never spoken to the whistleblower, who recent reports state is a registered Democrat that worked with former Vice President Joe Biden in the Obama White House.", "description": "House Intel panel Republicans sent a letter to Adam Schiff in which they accuse him of \"withholding the existence\" of impeachment documents.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176382930-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
