It is also praised as a \u201cbeacon\u201d of democracy in the region for its democratic reforms and civil liberties since it emerged from one of the world\u2019s longest periods of martial law.\n\nBut International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) noted Taiwan still faces key challenges and passed a motion condemning its use of death penalty Friday as it wrapped up a week-long congress in Taipei, its first held in Asia.", "description": "Taipei (AFP) \u2013 Some two hundred thousand revellers marched through Taipei in a riot of rainbow colours and celebration on Saturday as Taiwan held", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/b3d97a_in-may-lawmakers-unprecedented-decision-legalise-sex-marriages-place-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
