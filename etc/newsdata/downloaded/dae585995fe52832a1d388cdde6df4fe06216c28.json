The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 45.41 points, or 0.17%, to finish at 27,182.45. The S&P 500 added 8.64 points, or 0.29%, to close at 3009.57, and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.79 points, or 0.30%, to close at 8194.47.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would delay increasing tariffs to 30% from 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. The rate hike was scheduled to kick in on Oct. 1, and is now pushed back by another 15 days. At the same time, China has reportedly made some big purchases of American soybeans and is considering to allow companies to resume purchases of U.S. agriculture products going forward.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nThese moves are viewed as gestures of goodwill from both the U.S. and China in an effort to de-escalate trade tensions ahead of the planned face-to-face meeting in Washington next month. Hopes that some progress could be made in October helped the yuan gain against the dollar, and Asian equities moved higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield also rose 5.6 percentage points to 1.789%, continuing the rally that started last week.\n\nThere has been some back and forth in today\u2019s headlines about whether the Trump administration will offer an interim trade deal to China. Still, the chances of a deal remain slim, according to Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group, since the looming controversies\u2014such as intellectual property, data privacy and national security\u2014are subjects that matter a lot to both countries.\n\nBesides trade progress, today\u2019s European Central Bank meeting was closely watched by global traders as well. To boost the depressed eurozone economy, the ECB launched a new round of monetary easing measures on Thursday.\n\nThe central bank cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to negative 0.50%\u2014further into the negative territory\u2014and announced that it would restart the monthly bond-buying program of \u20ac20 billion ($21.9 billion) a month, starting from November. It improved the terms of cheap loans to further encourage lending, and\u2014to mitigate the impact of negative rates\u2014introduced a two-tiered deposit system that would exempt some excess reserves parked by banks with the ECB from the negative rate.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s forward guidance on interest rates\u2014rather than being date-contingent\u2014will now stay at a lower level until inflation in the eurozone \u201crobustly\u201d converges with the bank\u2019s target inflation rate of just below 2%, says ECB President Mario Draghi.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "The Dow notched its seventh straight gain with Thursday\u2019s close, and now sits only 216 points below its 52-week high.
