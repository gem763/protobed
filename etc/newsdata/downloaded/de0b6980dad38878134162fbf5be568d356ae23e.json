Earth is the bright crescent seen in the background. Elon Musk/SpaceX via Instagram\n\nOn February 6, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful operational rocket, called Falcon Heavy, for the first time.\n\nThe launch sent company founder Elon Musk's own red Tesla Roadster on a path that crosses the orbit of Mars. This attracted the attention of researchers worried about an eventual crash into the red planet, which would contaminate the world \u2014 and any alien microbes living there.\n\nBut planetary science researchers can now breathe a little easier, if a new study about the Roadster's fate is correct.\n\nMusk put his Roadster on top of the 230-foot-tall rocket with a spacesuit-clad dummy named \" Starman\" in the driver's seat. Launching the car demonstrated Falcon Heavy's capabilities and was reportedly a backup plan for a scientific NASA or military payload.\n\nThe Roadster's short-lived yet unparalleled camera feeds, overall silliness (as Musk has described it), and far-flung path through space captured global attention.\n\nBut not all of it has proved welcome.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk in a press conference after the launch of Falcon Heavy. Dave Mosher/Business Insider The Planetary Society's Jason Davis bemoaned the planetary protection risk posed by Musk's un-sterilized car crashing into Mars and sprinkling debris coated with bacteria, viruses, and fungi all over the planet. The reason: alien microbes may be hiding out in Martian soil.\n\n\"NASA goes to great lengths sterilizing spacecraft designed to land on Mars, in order to make sure there's no chance of Earthly microbes contaminating the surface,\" Davis wrote in a post before launch. \"Such a contamination could harm existing life and muddle scientific efforts to search for said life.\"\n\nBut that risk now appears minimal, according to a new scientific study titled \"The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets.\"\n\nThree researchers at the University of Toronto posted their paper on Tuesday to the pre-print arXiv server and submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nWhere and when Musk's Tesla will most likely crash\n\nA chart showing the location of Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster in space on February 15, 2018. WhereIsTesla.com\n\nHanno Rein, an astrophysicist and lead author of the study, said the roughly week-long research came out of advanced orbital-mechanics computer simulations.\n\n\"Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun,\" Rein told Business Insider, and likely within 10 million years \u2014 not hundreds of millions or possibly billions, as Musk has suggested.\n\nTo arrive at that conclusion, Rein and his colleagues started with orbital tracking data for the Roadster posted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Then they plugged that data into simulation software called REBOUND, which allowed them to fast-forward the car's likeliest orbital paths through the solar system over the next few million years.\n\nThat data suggest Musk's car will fly out past Mars orbit, spending very little time there, and then swing back around, over and over again.\n\n\"Every 30 years or so, it will come relatively close to the Earth,\" Rein said, where it will get a gravitational tug. \"This causes a change of a few percent in some of the orbital parameters. The distance to the sun would change slightly, for example, and the orbit's eccentricity.\"\n\nThe calculations suggest the Roadster will come within one Earth-moon distance of our planet within 100 years, possibly enabling new Earth-based telescope views.\n\nElon Musk's red Tesla Roadster before launching on a Falcon Heavy rocket toward Mars orbit. Elon Musk/SpaceX; Instagram\n\nBut after its third flyby, Rein said the Roadster will take on an increasingly chaotic and somewhat unpredictable path through space. That's because those gravitational tugs near Earth's orbit \u2014 where the car will spend most of its time compared to other bodies in the system \u2014 can \"lead to a huge change afterward,\" Rein said.\n\nBy running hundreds of different simulations of those orbital possibilities out to 3.5 million years from today, Rein and his colleagues figured out there's a 6% chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5% chance of crashing into Venus during that time.\n\n\"We've not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens,\" Rein said. \"The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun.\"\n\nAstronomers are tracking the car in space\n\nTwo other astronomers \u2014 Gianluca Masi of The Virtual Telescope Project and Michael Schwartz of Tenagra Observatories, Ltd. \u2014 also used JPL data to track the Roadster.\n\nLast week, they managed to photograph the car flying beyond the moon moving at a speed of roughly 25,000 miles per hour.\n\nThe vehicle is reflective enough to see through a telescope, at least for now, leading to what they called a \"stunning\" animation of several images.\n\nMasi said he and Schwartz will continue to track the Roadster for as long as possible.\n\n\"The object is slowly fading: you can image it now with a 6\" or so scope,\" Masi told Business Insider in an email. \"In one month or so it will need a much larger scope to be imaged (16\" or larger).\"", "description": "Planetary science researchers can breathe a little easier now, thanks to new research that simulates the bacteria-coated car's final destination.", "authors": ["Dave Mosher"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a7dc370d03072a20e8b498b-960-480.jpg"}
