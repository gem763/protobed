REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nThe protesters, many in all-black clothing and face-masks now banned under a resurrected British colonial-era law, had gathered to denounce perceived police brutality during more than four months of often-violent unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.\n\nThere was a standoff as dusk fell, with protesters, bemused tourists and passers-by gathered on the pavements of the shopping and hotel artery of Nathan Road, which police had earlier cleared in slow-moving cordons.\n\nRiot police stood by outside the Chungking Mansions high-rise warren of South Asian restaurants and backpacker hostels, shields and batons at the ready. Protesters shouted obscenities in colorful Cantonese at \u201cblack police\u201d, referring to their perceived over-use of force.\n\n\u201cFight for Hong Kong!\u201d protesters shouted, \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d, a reference to demands for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police actions, among other things.\n\nPolice later moved away, leaving protesters, pedestrians and tourists alike to take over the street under the neon lights. Then one water cannon moved in, firing high into the air and down side-streets.\n\nPolice said protesters later hurled petrol bombs at a police station in Sham Shui Po, northwest of Tsim Sha Tsui, and set fire to shops in Jordan, north along Nathan Road from the harbor.\n\n\u201cSome attacked police officers with hard objects and umbrellas,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cSome hurled smoke bombs at MTR (metro) exits.\u201d\n\nReuters witnesses saw two MTR entrances on fire in Mongkok.\n\nThe number of protesters had grown by the minute earlier in the afternoon, streaming down Nathan Road to the water\u2019s edge, in front of the dramatic backdrop of Hong Kong island, but many fled after the tear gas and pepper spray were fired.\n\nAmbulances took one man away on a stretcher. The need for treatment was not immediately clear.\n\nPolice detained some protesters as they gathered in a rally that had not received official permission. The crowds at the waterfront had largely dispersed after a couple of hours and headed north up Nathan Road, where many luxury brand shops closed their shutters, toward Jordan and Mongkok.\n\nThe rallying cry of the protesters was also for the protection of \u201cMuslims, journalists and the people\u201d.\n\nRelated Coverage Hong Kong police fire tear gas to disperse protesters\n\nA police water cannon fired bursts of blue-dyed water at a small group of people outside a Nathan Road mosque during protests last weekend, drawing criticism from some in the Muslim community. There was a large crowd of police outside the mosque on Sunday.\n\n\u2018NO TO TOTALITARIANISM\u2019\n\nBilly, 26, a salesman who did not want to give his full name, said he turned out on Sunday because he was angry at the spraying of the mosque a week earlier.\n\n\u201cHong Kong people, regardless of our religion ... we come here to say no to our totalitarian government,\u201d he told Reuters, adding he wanted to protest peacefully. \u201cI have a little bit of fear ... because our police sometimes they are uncontrollable and they threaten the safety of our people.\u201d\n\nVick, 26, a social worker standing outside Chungking Mansions, said he was there in solidarity with South Asians.\n\n\u201cWe would like to express our sympathy, and our discontent with the Hong Kong police and the Hong Kong government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like the government to make the police more just and less violent.\u201d\n\nCindy Chu, 65, a retired nurse, said the police used to be a force for good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so simple. They are disturbing the Hong Kong people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what for? What authority do they have to do that? It\u2019s Hong Kong, not China.\u201d\n\nShe too was wearing a face mask.\n\nPro-democracy activists have in recent weeks attacked police with petrol bombs and rocks and slashed one officer in the neck with a knife. Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds, wounding several protesters and a few journalists.\n\nPolice deny accusations of brutality, saying they have shown restraint in life-threatening situations. There had been a week-long lull in clashes.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they view as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog that the quarter-on-quarter contraction recorded in the three months ending in June had extended into the third quarter.\n\nTwo successive quarters of contraction are the technical definition of a recession.\n\nHe said the economy had come under strain on all fronts. \u201cThe true remedy was for all quarters in society to stop violence, return to rational dialogue and seek a way out,\u201d he said.", "description": "Hong Kong anti-government protesters set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs on Sunday, police said, after riot police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands in the Tsim Sha Tsui harbor-front hotel district.", "authors": ["John Geddie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445478961&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0BY", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
