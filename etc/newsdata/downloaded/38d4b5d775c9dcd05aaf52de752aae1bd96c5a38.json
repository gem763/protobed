But even the Conservative conference speech by Britain\u2019s vandal prime minister couldn\u2019t entirely overshadow the one from Tesco.\n\nDavid Lewis, the man who cured the supermarket that ate Britain of a horrible case of indigestion and got it chowing down again (up to a point), is set to depart in a move almost no one saw coming.\n\nThere\u2019d been none of the usual speculation about successors and careful prepping of the ground one often sees in the run-up to the exit of a longstanding and successful CEO.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOn the other hand, it does say something about the way Tesco\u2019s boardroom has been revived alongside the business, that Lewis\u2019s external replacement was sought out and settled upon so that their identity could be revealed on the same day as the departure was announced. All that and a fairly punchy set of interim results.\n\nThat replacement is Ken Murphy, who will join Tesco next year from Walgreens Boots Alliance, which owns Boots the chemist among other things.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nWhen a CEO of Lewis\u2019s standing unexpectedly announces their departure without a job to go to, cites a \u201cpersonal choice\u201d, and talks about needing to recharge his batteries, people are naturally inclined to be curious.\n\nThe fortunes CEOs make afford them the opportunity of seeking out a nice beach at a time of their choosing. They just aren\u2019t wired to do that. They wouldn\u2019t be CEOs if they were.\n\nLewis said he \u201chonestly did not know\u201d whether he wanted another corporate role having spent three decades at Unilever prior to taking the top job at Tesco.\n\nWe have no choice but to take him at his word. However, if the 54-year-old does decide he wants one it will surely be there for him.\n\nTesco was reeling from an accounting scandal when he joined, with the public and the City having fallen out of love with the lumbering, charmless beast it had become under Philip Clarke.\n\nLewis set about shaking the place up, and how. He\u2019s got the dividend motoring, done a major deal (the merger with wholesaler Booker), revived sales and profits, and rekindled some of the City\u2019s and the shopper\u2019s enthusiasm for the business. Phew!\n\nIt hasn\u2019t gone all his own way. The nationalistic discounter Jack\u2019s has proven to be an underwhelming addition to Tesco\u2019s portfolio. And his surgery has not been without cost. Thousands of jobs have been axed along the way. There are parts of the workforce that won\u2019t be as sorry to see him go as his investors. They paid him the ultimate compliment by marking the shares down after his departure announcement hit the City\u2019s screens.\n\nA point made by Lewis is that a CEO\u2019s term should be finite, and last for maybe five to seven years. The average is a bit less than that, so it was well made. He\u2019ll have done six by the time of his departure.\n\nHis chair John Allan says he was told of the plans some months ago. They left the latter in a tough spot. The natural successor to Lewis was seen as Charles Wilson, who had run Booker prior to the merger. However, he\u2019d stepped back from running Tesco\u2019s UK arm due to illness.\n\nThe other senior candidates were seen as needing a little more seasoning in their posts, hence the external hire of Murphy.\n\nHis challenge might not look as tough as the one faced by Lewis when he joined \u2013 but in many ways it is. He has to live up to the standards set by his predecessor, who is quitting while he\u2019s ahead, just as his predecessor bar one, Sir Terry Leahy, did. That\u2019s an underrated skill.\n\nLewis will at least be around to see the business through Brexit, if it happens, which would be a tough ask for anyone.\n\nBut notwithstanding that fly in the ointment, the business is entering a new phase. It\u2019s been fixed. It\u2019s making good profits and the dividend is motoring but it is still operating in a brutally competitive market into which Aldi and Lidl are continuing to expand. Investors will be inclined to ask, what next? Where\u2019s our growth going to come from?\n\nThose are different questions to the ones Lewis was asked when he joined. Murphy\u2019s tenure will be defined by how he answers them.", "description": "Britain\u2019s ongoing political crisis has rather eclipsed a fairly frenetic series of City announcements in recent days.
