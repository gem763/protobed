The SDF had detained 9,000 militants in Syria by April, according to US military officials. The military also estimated 1,000 of them hailed from 50 different countries.\n\nA recent inspector general's report from the Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve noted that the reduction in US forces \"reduced the ability of [the task force] to maintain 'visibility'\" at a refugee camp, which \"created conditions that allow ISIS ideology to spread 'uncontested.'\"\n\nUS State Department counterterrorism coordinator Nathan Sales said the US was urging other nations to repatriate the ISIS fighters and prosecute them.\n\n\"Across the coalition, we need to prosecute ISIS leaders, fighters, financiers, and facilitators for the crimes they've committed,\" Sales said earlier in August. \"That includes building the law enforcement capacity of partner states that have the will to act but might lack the resources or expertise to do so. It also means repatriating and prosecuting foreign terrorist fighters.\"\n\nAround 1,050 Germans joined the Islamic State in the Middle East after 2013; and around 1,190 French citizens joined the group, according to Soufan Center, the global security non-profit group. Following the collapse of ISIS' bastions in Iraq and Syria, dozens of these foreign nationals were either killed or captured by coalition forces - leaving many of the prisoner's fates in limbo as their governments debate on their status.\n\nIn June, France passed legislation to repatriate French jihadists on a case-by-case basis - twelve French and two Dutch orphans whose parents were militants were transported to France. Germany also considered children as \"victims\" and has allowed them to be repatriated.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "\"I'll have no choice but to release them,\" Trump said Wednesday of the detained ISIS fighters.
