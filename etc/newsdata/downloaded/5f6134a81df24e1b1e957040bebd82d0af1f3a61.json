The armed officers join them, forming a perimeter around Guyger as she walks toward a side door of the yet-to-open Dallas courthouse.\n\nThe tension is high in Dallas as the white former police officer stands trial on murder charges in the fatal shooting last September of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean.\n\nDallas Police Association President Mike Mata said the intense media attention and controversy surrounding Jean\u2019s death have led to threats that prompted the association to pay for additional private security for Guyger and her attorneys. He declined to elaborate on the nature of the threats.\n\nThe concern about police safety follows an attack three years ago in which five Dallas officers were killed. A man angry over the killing of black men by police across the nation opened fire at the end of a protest, in the deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since 9/11.\n\nAs Guyger took the stand Friday, there was anxiety that her possible acquittal could spark unrest in Dallas like that in Ferguson, Missouri, after prosecutors announced that a white policeman wouldn\u2019t face charges in the fatal 2014 shooting of Michael Brown. The unarmed black teenager\u2019s death helped give rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely that kind of foreboding sense of a storm coming,\u201d said Changa Higgins, a community activist. \u201cIf this trial doesn\u2019t get the kind of outcome that people want, and that they really need to have hope, then we may see the same type of reaction that we\u2019ve seen historically around the country when people lose hope, and feel like they have nothing to lose and they can\u2019t look to the justice system to get justice.\u201d\n\nThe basic facts of the shooting aren\u2019t in dispute. Guyger walked up to Jean\u2019s apartment, which was on the fourth floor directly above her third-floor unit, and found the door unlocked. She was off duty but still dressed in her police uniform after a long shift when she shot Jean with her service weapon. Guyger was later arrested, fired and charged with murder.\n\nGuyger\u2019s lawyer\u2019s have called the killing a \u201ctragic, but innocent\u201d mistake and say she fired in self-defense after confusing Jean\u2019s apartment for her own and mistaking the 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean nation of St. Lucia for a burglar. Prosecutors have questioned how she could have missed numerous signs that she was at the wrong apartment.\n\nThe police department has limited the time off scheduled for officers during the trial, which overlaps with the Texas State Fair, but department officials declined to comment further on the security preparations for the trial. Mayor Eric Johnson said through a spokesman that it would be inappropriate for him to discuss the case while the trial is ongoing. In January, a judge issued a gag order, barring the lawyers involved from speaking about the case publicly.\n\nA jury will have to decide whether Guyger committed murder, a lesser offense such as manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, or no crime at all. Even before the jurors were sworn in Monday, the strain of the case was visible.\n\nInside the courthouse, a crush of people passed through two security screenings before gathering outside the room where the trial is being held. Members of Guyger\u2019s and Jean\u2019s families were allowed in first, but reporters and activists jostled for the few remaining seats, with many being turned away. At various points, a sheriff\u2019s deputy raised his voice to tell people not to push.\n\nThe Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Department, which handles security within the courtroom, has brought on additional officers for the trial. A department spokesman, Raul Reyna, declined to elaborate on the department\u2019s security procedures.\n\nThe county\u2019s Fire Marshal\u2019s Office oversees security in the rest of the court building, and it assigned four officers to come in early and four to stay late during the trial, said Fire Marshal Robert De Los Santos. He declined to go into further detail about how the courthouse is secured.\n\nDe Los Santos said there have been other cases in which his officers have taken similar precautions.\n\nMata, the police association president, said that although other police officers have stood trial for shootings, Guyger\u2019s is the first in which his association has had to hire extra security for lawyers or an officer.\n\n\u201cIt has never reached the level of this,\u201d he said.\n\nThreats in such prominent cases aren\u2019t unusual, said Herman Weisberg, a former New York City police detective who now works as a security consultant.\n\nWeisberg was tasked with getting Harvey Weinstein in and out of a New York City courtroom before the movie mogul changed lawyers in his sexual assault case. He said things are \u201cpretty comfortable\u201d once inside the courthouse, but that coming and going through crowds of protesters and reporters can be dicey for defendants and their lawyers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got several cases going where the attorneys might as well have done the alleged act themselves,\u201d Weisberg said.\n\n___\n\nDallas photographer L.M.
