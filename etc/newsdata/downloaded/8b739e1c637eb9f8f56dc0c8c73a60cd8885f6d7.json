Mortified when the naked man came out\" said another cringing viewer.\n\n\"Mark just kicked him in the balls\", remarked another.\n\nThe raucous show also saw James drink a \"dirty pint\" made of fish sauce, cottage cheese and pickled egg juice.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nTeam captain Holly Willoughby encouraged Mel to sniff the disgusting drink, and when she did so she instantly retched.\n\n\"Why would you do that to me Holly?!\" she asked the giggling presenter.\n\nJames then managed to down the entire drink, leaving his team mates covering their eyes with disbelief.\n\nMeanwhile Holly successfully made herself cry to James' heartbreak tune Goodbye My Lover.\n\nKeith embarrassed Mel on the show when he grilled her on her romance with Peter Andre.\n\n(Image: ITV / Talkback Thames)\n\nKeith started by asking the panel about childhood sweethearts, asking Mel whether she had one.\n\nShe looked shocked and simply replied: \"Yep\".\n\nMel played coy, giving one word answers and saying \"well uhhh\" before laying her head on the desk in exasperation.\n\nKeith refuses to give up, and asks Mel to look into the camera and give Peter a message.\n\nScary Spice said: \"Not doing it, that's going to be the f*****g trailer...\"\n\nHowever, she then gives in to Keith and records her message for Peter, saying: \"You're very lovely.\"\n\nMel then turns back to Keith and yells: \"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n*Celebrity Juice airs on Thursdays at 10pm on ITV2", "description": "The celebs completed an eye-popping assault course which involved diving through a stark naked man's legs", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Itv", "Talkback Thames"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20556251.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RLP_MDG_218792211622224JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
