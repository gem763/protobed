Both the US and Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran for the strikes.\n\n\u201cRemember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their \u201cairspace\u201d when, in fact, it was nowhere close,\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted. \u201cThey stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see?\u201d\n\nPrior to this the president said he was \u201clocked and loaded\u201c, saying the US knew who was to blame for the strikes. Yemeni Houthi rebels \u2013 embroiled in a years-long conflict with Saudi Arabia \u2013 have claimed responsibility for the strikes.\n\nEconomists at Capital Economics said in a note the conflict carries a major risk of sending oil prices skyrocketing and slowing the global economy even further.\n\nTheir worst case scenario is \u201ca full-blown US-Iran conflict, which could cause the oil price to rise to $150 per barrel this year.\u201d\n\nHowever, they would expect the oil price to retreat from that level to around $80 per barrel in 2020 and $60 in 2021 as other producers filled the supply gap.\n\nIn their medium-case scenario, \u201cThe associated supply constraints and higher risk premium could drive the oil price up to about $85 per barrel this year, where it might remain,\u201d they wrote.\n\nCapital\u2019s best-case scenario is a \u201cmainly precautionary\u201d cut-off and a swift restoration of Saudi oil supply. \u201cIn this event, we would see the price of Brent crude falling back in line with our previous forecasts of $60 per barrel by year-end, $65 by the end of 2020 and $68 at end-2021.\u201d\n\nThe economists also expect the conflict to have a major impact on the global economy. \u201cWe expect global growth to stabilize at a slow pace rather than weaken further,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut a continued escalation of tensions in the Middle East would make us more inclined to forecast a deeper downturn.\u201d\n\nSee More: The disruption to Saudi oil could last 3 months \u2013 a scenario Goldman Sachs says would send oil prices surging another 12%", "description": "Business Insider - Oil could rise to $85 a barrel without any escalation, Capital Economics says..
