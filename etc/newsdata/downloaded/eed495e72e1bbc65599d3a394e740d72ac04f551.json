Both he and Alexandru were killed instantly.\n\nJason was killed after pulling onto the hard shoulder. Just last week, Dev Naran, eight, from Leicester, was killed when his grandfather's stationary car, on a hard shoulder, was hit by a lorry\n\n'It was the only blessing. I was told they wouldn't have known anything about it.'\n\nRoads like the one Jason died on are being unveiled all over the country, with Smart motorways using traffic management systems to monitor and control roads.\n\nMore than 400 miles of Smart motorways are already in place across the UK and they control traffic through a variety of ways.\n\nThese include speed limit control and getting rid of the hard shoulder - though it can be reinstated if needed.\n\nWhen an accident occurs, the technology is supposed to flash a large red X, warning vehicles of the breakdown.\n\nMrs Mercer is taking on Highways England, threatening legal action and battling to find out the truth about smart motorways, which road safety campaigners argue have turned drivers into \u2018sitting ducks\u2019 (stock image)\n\nAlexandru Mergeanu, 22, was also killed in the northbound M1 accident. He was exchanging insurance information with Jason when they were hit\n\nHowever, this can fail, leading to drivers of broken down vehicles being placed in danger.\n\nJust last week, Dev Naran, eight, from Leicester, was killed when his grandfather's stationary car, on a hard shoulder, was struck by a lorry.\n\nFollowing his tragic death, a coroner warned that 'lives are at risk'.\n\nThe Smart motorways have been branded 'death traps' by campaigners, families of the dead and even MPs.\n\nNew figures show that motorway deaths have risen by eight per cent since 2017, while more than half of drivers want to scrap Smart motorways altogether because of safety worries.\n\nHowever, despite these concerns Smart motorways could be doubles by 2025.\n\nOn the same stretch of motorway where Jason died, Derek Jacobs, 83, was killed in March after stopping his vehicle between junctions 30 and 31 in Derbyshire.\n\nA 78-year-old man also involved in the collision died in hospital two months later.\n\nAnd months before that a 62-year-old woman was killed on the road after leaving a broken-down car.", "description": "Jason Mercer, 44, was killed just 15 minutes after saying goodbye to his wife Claire, 43, when an 18-tonne HGV smashed into him as he stood on the hard shoulder.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/18/19850734-0-image-a-14_1571334481705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
