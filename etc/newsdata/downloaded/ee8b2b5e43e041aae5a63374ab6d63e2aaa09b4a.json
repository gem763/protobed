Really now. Funny how after eight years of Barack Obama quid pro quo-ing here, there and everywhere, it\u2019s only now Democrats care.\n\nIt\u2019s only now Democrats seem to have gleaned a sense of conscientiously objecting to what they perceive as abusing one\u2019s high office to obtain political or personal favors.\n\nNot that Trump\u2019s call with the Ukraine president falls under that header. Hardly.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff may be out and about, trying to make some sort of federal case over the just-released five-page transcript of the telephone conversation by wildly saying, \u201cIt is shocking. \u2026 What those notes reflect is a classic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t you believe it. Read it yourself.\n\nAnd while reading, in between yawns, consider this, a headline from Green Biz, from March of 2011: \u201cBarack Obama, Clean Tech and the Political Quid Pro Quo.\u201d\n\nThe piece goes on to recount how the Center for Public Integrity published \u201ca long, in-depth look at how some of the Obama campaign\u2019s most prolific fundraisers have gotten loans, grants and special access to [his] administration,\u201d to include a \u201cdeep look at how [Steve] Westly, former California state controller and venture capitalist \u2026 landed intimate access to the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nThe Westly Group funded, among other companies, Tesla Motors. And all the while he was visiting the White House, serving as a member of the Obama administration\u2019s advisory board on energy policy, and so forth and so on, he was raking in half a billion dollars in loans, grants and stimulus bucks for his green companies. That was money from the Obama Energy Department to Westly, the guy who wined and dined with Obama et al with eyebrow-raising frequency. Corruption? Quid pro quo?\n\nAs Green Biz put it, such intertwining of politics and business is \u201cabout the most commonplace form of political quid pro quo that exists.\u201d\n\nNo biggie; nothing to see here; move on? Maybe. \u201cPolitical sausage-making,\u201d as Green Biz writes, is barely a blip these days.\n\nBut then there\u2019s this.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama\u2019s Ambassador Legacy: Plum Postings for Big Donors,\u201d Public Integrity wrote, in a January, 2017, headline.\n\nLegacy, indeed. Obama, according to Public Integrity, gave cushy ambassador posts to 31 campaign faithfuls who pulled in at least $50,000 for his reelection. He also doled out second-term ambassador slots to 39 who gave generously to his campaign, either in the form or money or political capital \u2014 or both.\n\nThe Washington Post made a whole map out of Obama\u2019s campaign-cash-cows-for-ambassador-posts coincidences. Why not? Have some fun with it.\n\n\u201cThis very telling map shows which U.S. ambassadors were campaign bundlers,\u201d The Post wrote back in February 2014.\n\nQuid pro quo?\n\nAnother headline above a September 2017 YouTube video asks the same question, different arena: \u201cPresident Obama and Wall Street Quid Pro Quo?\u201d\n\nAnd then there was this, from the Wall Street Journal in August of 2016: \u201cPresident Barack Obama on Thursday defended his decision to authorize a $400 million cash payment to Iran that coincided with the country\u2019s release of American prisoners in January.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s that whole quid pro quo label sneaking up again \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s better known as That Time Obama Paid Ransom to Terrorists.\n\n\u201c[The] Obama administration insists there was no quid pro quo,\u201d The Wall Street Journal wrote in a separate piece in August, 2016.\n\nGuess it was just coincidence those Americans were released at the same time the White House was directing secret loads of cash onto an airplane bound for Tehran. Onto an unmarked cargo plane.\n\nQuid pro quo?\n\nGood question. Good questions, all. Just don\u2019t ask the Democrats. They\u2019re too busy sifting through the five-page transcript of Trump\u2019s telephone call for something, anything \u2014 oh, God, please, please, anything! \u2014 they can sell as quid pro quo to take down Trump and go forward with their only election hope for 2020: impeach.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
