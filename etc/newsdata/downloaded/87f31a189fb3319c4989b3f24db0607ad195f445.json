It\u2019s about #China\u2019s growing ability to restrict freedom of expression here in the US,\u201d he added in a series of tweets.\n\nAnd Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, warned \u201cno one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom\u201d.\n\nSilver, who heads to China this week with other top NBA top brass, said the furore was evidence that \u201cwords truly do matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept that it is also (the) Chinese government\u2019s and Chinese businesses\u2019 right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has been battered by four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests sparked by opposition to a now-scrapped bill that would have allowed extraditions of criminal suspects to China.\n\nThe protests are fuelled by fears China is strangling the freedoms enshrined under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework for Hong Kong that has been in place since its handover from the British in 1997.\n\nThroughout the unrest China has sought to use its political and financial muscle to pressure major firms into publicly supporting its position.\n\nHong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific was heavily pressured in a campaign led by state-run media after Chinese authorities deemed the airline\u2019s staff too vocal in their support of the protesters.\n\nThe airline\u2019s then-chairman John Slosar initially insisted he would not dream of telling his staff what to think, but Chinese threats to blacklist the carrier forced a U-turn and Slosar stepped down last month.\n\nCathay Pacific now warns its staff against supporting the protests.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 The NBA has insisted it backs free speech, after US politicians accused it of caving to China in a row over a pro-democracy tweet that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/83d080_houston-rockets-asia-exhibition-games-but-plunged-political-firestorm-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
