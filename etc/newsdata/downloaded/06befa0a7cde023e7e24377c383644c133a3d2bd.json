But on China, Cuban has suddenly lost his voice.\n\nCuban has been mysteriously silent during this flap over the NBA\u2019s slavish support of the oppressive Chinese government. Indeed, even when quizzed directly on the topic by the Washington Times, Cuban would not offer one of his famous, long-winded opinions.\n\nThe paper sent Cuban an email asking his opinion on the China flap, but Cuban waived off saying only, \u201c\u2018ll refer you to Adam silvers [sic] comments.\u201d\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver released a statement this week scolding critics of the communist nation and added, \u201cwe have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China.\u201d\n\nIt may seem shocking that Mark Cuban would have no opinion on something in the news. He seems to think he knows something about everything else.\n\nCuban is sure he has the answer on how to gut the Second Amendment.\n\nCuban thinks he knows when President Donald Trump should be listened to and when he should not.\n\nCuban is sure he has the solutions for the U.S. economy.\n\nCuban thinks he knows how to re-write the U.S. Constitution to make health care a \u201cright.\u201d\n\nCuban even thinks he is the answer to the country itself and has said that he thinks he would make a great president of the United States. He has also said that he could beat Trump in 2020.\n\nBut on China\u2019s massive human rights abuses, suddenly Mark Cuban has nothing to say.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Dallas Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban has never held back from speaking publicly about politics and international relations, but even Cuban is", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/R-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
