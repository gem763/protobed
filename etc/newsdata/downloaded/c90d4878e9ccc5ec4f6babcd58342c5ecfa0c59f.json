All parties responded positively to the coalition's calls,\" coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said on Monday.\n\nTRENCHES AND TUNNELS\n\nSaudi Arabia's main coalition partner, the Gulf ally the UAE, openly intervened on behalf of the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) last week by bombing government forces trying to regain control of Aden, forcing them to retreat.\n\nSTC forces also brought reinforcements into Aden, witnesses said on Tuesday, calling back fighters who had been deployed on the outskirts of the main port of Hodeidah, held by the Houthis, in the west.\n\nThe fighters dug tunnels and built trenches at the edges of Aden and blocked main roads leading out of the city to prevent government forces from recapturing it, they said.\n\nThe STC, which accuses Hadi's government of mismanagement, made its move on Aden after the UAE scaled down its military presence in Yemen in June under increased Western pressure to the end the war. But Abu Dhabi retained influence through tens of thousands of southern fighters it has armed and trained.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council last week urged all sides to show restraint and preserve Yemen's territorial integrity.\n\nEscalating violence across Yemen and the evident rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE could complicate United Nations efforts to restart peace talks to end the conflict, which is largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nEarlier this week, coalition warplanes bombed a prison complex in southwest Yemen, killing more than 100 people. The U.N. called for an investigation but the coalition insisted it had struck a Houthi arms storage site.\n\nThe Houthis, who hold Sanaa and most big population centers, have seized on the Aden events as proof that Hadi cannot rule or be a serious partner in any negotiations. The group denies being a puppet of Tehran and says it is fighting a corrupt system.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters team in Yemen; Additional reporting by Stephen Kalin in Riyadh; Writing by Aziz El Yaakoubi, Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Alison Williams)", "description": "ADEN (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has deployed more troops in southern Yemen to try to contain clashes between nominal allies in the Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Houthis that risks further fragmenting the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png"}
