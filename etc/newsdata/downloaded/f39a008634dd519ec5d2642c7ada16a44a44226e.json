Chief Executive Michael Corbat named Jane Fraser as his No. 2, signaling that she is the most likely candidate to replace him.\n\nThe New York bank said Ms. Fraser has been named president of the firm, a decision that crystallized her rank above Stephen Bird, who had also been considered a potential CEO candidate.
