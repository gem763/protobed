It Was 3M Stock\u2019s Fault.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nMixed Picture. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped Thursday, pulled down by the 4% dip in 3M stock (ticker: MMM) after the maker of Post-its cut guidance. The S&P 500 eked out a small gain, while the Nasdaq Composite rose, helped by positive numbers from tech companies including Microsoft (ticker: MSFT). Global growth continued to soften, but U.S. factories saw a surprise bounceback. Vice President Mike Pence delivered another speech on China, while U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for a snap general election on Dec. 12 to ensure his Brexit deal goes through. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nThe Bad Cop on China\n\nThe three major indexes ended the day with mixed results, as various earnings reports pulled them into different directions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 28.42 points, or 0.11%, to close at 26805.53. The S&P 500 added 5.77 points, or 0.19%, to finish at 3010.29, while the Nasdaq Composite increased 66.00 points, or 0.81%, to close at 8185.80.\n\nVice President Pence delivered a speech about China on Thursday at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Pence had spoken tough on China last year as the U.S.-China trade war was heating up, accusing the country of interfering in American politics and suppressing freedom of speech.\n\nIn the face of an expected \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal next month, it seems that Pence will continue to play \u201cbad cop\u201d to President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgood cop.\u201d A finalized deal with China could halt new tariffs and boost purchases of American agricultural products.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nToday, Pence called China a strategic and economic rival in his speech, and accused Beijing of intellectual-property theft, outsized military ambitions, and poor treatment of China\u2019s Muslim minorities. He also backed the pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong and slammed the National Basketball Association.\n\nA tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong protesters has set off a crisis between the NBA and China. Pence accused the NBA of \u201csiding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech\u201d and \u201cacting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\u201d Pence\u2019s criticism of the NBA comes despite the fact that the association never actually apologized for Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nStill, Pence said the Trump administration is not trying to confront or decouple from the world\u2019s second-largest economy, nor is it trying to contain China\u2019s development. The U.S. is open to a \u201cconstructive relationship with China\u2019s leaders,\u201d he said, and willing to start anew if China can end its unfair trade practices.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much detail in Pence\u2019s policy-related remarks, and the stock market largely shrugged off the speech.\n\nElsewhere, global economic data continued to show softness in October. The purchasing managers index in the Eurozone came in lower than expected for both the manufacturing and services sectors, but didn\u2019t fall from the previous month. The German manufacturing sector remained the key drag for the region, with employment in the industry falling the most in nearly 10 years. Japan PMI also fell into the contraction zone below the 50 threshold for the first time in three years, while South Korea reported that its gross-economic-product growth came in much slower in the third quarter compared with the previous three months.\n\nAmid weak readings, the U.S. manufacturing October PMI posted 51.5, up from September\u2019s reading and well above the consensus of 50.5. This marks the highest level in six months and a gradual recovery from the index\u2019s August lows. The services PMI came at 51.0, in line with consensus and largely flat from last month\u2019s reading.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "The Dow slipped Thursday, pulled down by the 4% dip in 3M stock after the maker of Post-its cut guidance.
