Do we want shares of Peloton? See, here's what I think happens [with unicorns]. First we think Uber is a platform, then it turns out to be a cab company. Then we think that [WeWork CEO Adam] Neumann is about the new way to have real estate. Then we think it's just a realtor. Now Peloton, they're saying it is an eight ways platform. Can I tell you what Peloton is? It is a way to hang your towels up.\"\n\nPeloton is expected to go public later this month.\n\nUber in May debuted below its IPO price and ended up with a valuation below $80 billion, far from the once expected $120 billion. The shares are trading at $32.61 on Monday after going public at $45.", "description": "CNBC's Jim Cramer calls on investors to be wary of the slew of hyped-up unicorn companies going public this year and encourages the focus to be on deliverable earnings.", "authors": ["Jessica Bursztynsky"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105387793-1533838186831gettyimages-903921722.jpg?v=1533838648", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
