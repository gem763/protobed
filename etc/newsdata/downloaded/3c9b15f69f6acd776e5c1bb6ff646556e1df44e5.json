Speaker of the House John Bercow will make a statement on the Brexit procedure immediately after the Defense Questions.\n\nThe deal dictates that Britain exit in an \u201corderly and friendly way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis deal abolishes the backstop in the old deal,\u201d the British government said in a statement. \u201cThe government put forward a reasonable compromise, based on the key principles of consent for the people of Northern Ireland, and the U.K. leaving the EU Customs Union whole and entire, which was agreed at the European Council last week. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill puts those internationally agreed obligations into domestic law.\u201d\n\nJohnson has sent a request for an extension, as required by law, because the deal wasn\u2019t approved by Saturday, when the House of Commons failed to find a consensus for a vote.\n\nBercow said Saturday he may not allow another vote because Parliament technically can\u2019t vote on the same item twice in one session.\n\n\u201c[Lawmakers] will today have in front of them a bill that will get Brexit done by Oct. 31, protect jobs and the integrity of the U.K., and enable us to move into the people\u2019s priorities like health, education and crime,\u201d Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said.\n\nA failure by Johnson and other pro-Brexit lawmakers to get the bill passed could result in a no confidence vote in Johnson, the same fate met by former Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this year. It could also mean a second nationwide referendum on Brexit, something anti-Brexit groups have been pushing for for months.\n\nLabor Party member Hilary Benn said he expects a vote Monday \u201cseeking to put this whole deal back to the British people,\u201d and another saying \u201cwe should remain in the customs union.\u201d\n\nEU leaders are pushing for an answer either way on Brexit soon.\n\n\u201cWe need a yes or no before Oct. 31,\u201d French Secretary of State for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin said. \u201cThe worst of Brexit is not a no-deal, it is extended uncertainty. The fact that today we are unable to say to businesses, fishermen, farmers and family, \u2018Voila! This is what is going to happen.\u2019 This is what creates recession.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 After three and a half years of political wrangling, Britain is again expected to vote Monday on another deal to leave the European", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
