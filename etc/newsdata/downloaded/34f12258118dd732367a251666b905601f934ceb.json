Worse \u2013 for Spain, at least \u2013 it is a sign that Spanish control of the province is coming to an end.\n\nThe sentences were \u201cantidemocratic, oppressive and totally counterproductive\u201d for the Spanish government, because \u201cnow [the pro-independence politicians] will achieve martyrdom,\u201d Salmond explained.\n\nThis is the day that these Spanish judges actually sealed the fate of the Spanish state. I don\u2019t see the Catalan crisis ending now anywhere except in Catalan independence.\n\nThe Catalans were found guilty of sedition, but not rebellion, the most serious of the charges they faced over the 2017 declaration of independence. The secession attempt followed a referendum, banned by the Madrid government, that saw 90 percent of Catalans vote for independence despite a heavy-handed crackdown on those 42 percent who turned out to polls.\n\nThe Supreme Court declared all defendants were all involved in \u201cundeniable\u201d acts of violence during the uprising, while they countered they were on trial for their ideas and not their actions and had merely sought to give Catalan citizens a voice.\n\nSalmond slammed the government\u2019s \u201coppressive\u201d use of the judicial system to \u201csilence their political opponents,\u201d noting it \u201cwill have exactly the opposite effect\u201d \u2013 and sure enough, the streets of Barcelona were packed with protesters outraged over the verdict.\n\nAlso on rt.com 37 injured, 100+ flights cancelled as police clash with Catalan pro-independence protesters at Barcelona airport (VIDEOS)\n\nSlamming Madrid for its archaic definition of \u201csedition\u201d as a crime even in the absence of violence, Salmond called for the government to be put on trial over its \u201cundemocratic actions\u201d and predicted that Catalan politicians would obtain justice in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, where they will appeal the verdict. As First Minister, Salmond led the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.\n\nWhen elected politicians use unelected judges to sentence other elected politicians to 100 years between the nine of them, then things have reached a point which cannot be sustained, and the Spanish state I don\u2019t think will survive this outrage.\n\nSalmond\u2019s words echoed those of Catalan Republican Left party leader Oriol Junqueras, who received the longest prison term of the group, 13 years. Upon his sentencing, Junqueras said independence for Catalonia was \u201ccloser than ever.\u201d\n\nCarlos Puigdemont, the former Catalan premier who led the 2017 bid for independence, tweeted in solidarity from Belgium, where he fled to avoid arrest after the uprising, calling the verdict an \u201catrocity.\u201d\n\nSpain has thus far been unsuccessful in convincing other European countries to extradite Puigdemont and his fellow Catalan pro-independence politicians, but that did not stop the Supreme Court from reactivating a European arrest warrant for him following Monday\u2019s sentencing.\n\nAlso on rt.com Tyranny of the minority: The \u0421atalonia litmus test proves European elites ignore referendums\n\nLike this story?
