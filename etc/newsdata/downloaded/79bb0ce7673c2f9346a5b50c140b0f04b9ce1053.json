You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe store is renowned for selling costumes to theatrical companies and is also particularly popular with local university students.\n\nThe costume is based on outfits worn by Nazi secret police who gathered intelligence on people living in Germany throughout the 1930s and 1940s and ensured that those considered to be enemies, including members of the Jewish community, were charged with treason and interred in concentration camps.\n\nThe uniforms worn by members of the Gestapo included a red operational armband which featured a swastika inside a white circle. However, the costume sold by the fancy dress shop does not appear to carry the symbol which has become synonymous with fascism.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was a poor choice of costume and I apologise.\"", "description": "A fancy dress shop has been criticised for selling an \u201coffensive\u201d Nazi uniform\u00a0costume.\u00a0 The \"Gestapo Officer\"\u00a0outfit, which costs \u00a335, includes a hat, button up shirt, trousers, boots and red armband.\u00a0 Last week, the controversial\u00a0costume\u00a0was spotted for sale in a shop called \"Party On\" located in Sheffield city centre.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/14/no-joke-a-hallo-429466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
