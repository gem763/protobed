General Assembly, on Tuesday, warning against the \u201ccruelty of socialism\u201d and accusing the U.N. itself of engaging in slave labor.\n\nBolsonaro made the accusation in relation to Cuba\u2019s slave doctor system, in which the communist regime forces doctors to work without pay abroad, taking almost the entirety of their salaries and investing them in the luxury lifestyles of the regime\u2019s leaders. The doctors are expected to live off of a \u201cstipend\u201d that many say often fails to cover basic food needs. Cuba makes an estimated $11 billion off of the slave doctor trade in deals with African, Latin American, and Pacific Island states.\n\n\u00cdntegra do discurso, abrindo a Assembl\u00e9ia Geral da ONU 2019. https://t.co/QPMGSh4uYu \u2014 Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) September 24, 2019\n\nOne of Bolsonaro\u2019s first acts after taking office in January was to end the Brazilian Cuban slave doctor program, known as Mais M\u00e9dicos (\u201cMore Doctors\u201d). Bolsonaro demanded that Cuba give a reasonable salary to its doctors from the payments that Brasilia makes Havana, prompting the regime to end the program entirely.\n\nIn New York, Bolsonaro noted that U.N. bodies like the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) openly aid and benefit from the Cuban slave doctor trade.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, an agreement between the former[ly ruling] Workers\u2019 Party [PT] and the Cuban dictatorship brought to Brazil 10,000 doctors,\u201d Bolsonaro explained. The agreement \u201cprevented [the doctors] from bringing their spouses or children and 75 percent of their wages were confiscated by the Cuban regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were further prevented from enjoying fundamental rights like, for example, coming and going [from Brazil,\u201d Bolsonaro noted. \u201cIt is truly tantamount to slave labor.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro made clear that this slave labor was \u201csupported by human rights organizations in Brazil and United Nations organizations.\u201d\n\nThe PAHO was a signatory to the deal between Brazil and Cuba that created Mais M\u00e9dicos. Inviting PAHO to participate in the deal would allow the then-socialist government of Brazil not to have to put the plan to import thousands of Cuban slave doctors before Congress, where it would have failed. An agreement between only Brazil and Cuba would legally be a treaty and thus require legislative approval. An agreement with the aid of an international organization like PAHO made the terms of the agreement secret and out of reach of the voters or lawmakers.\n\nPAHO took a payment from the Brazilian government to be involved in the deal.\n\nThe Brazilian president also made the case that his country had direct experience with the evils of Cuba\u2019s communist regime, when mass murderer Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara attempted to foment revolution in South America.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, Cuban agents were sent out to several countries to collaborate towards implementing dictatorships in the region. A few decades ago, they tried to change the Brazilian regime \u2026 they were defeated,\u201d Bolsonaro said, making a vague reference to the right-wing Brazilian military regime that took over in response to communist agitation.\n\nBolsonaro ended his remarks warning the world that socialism and communism have \u201cleft a path of death, ignorance, and stark poverty wherever [they go].\u201d", "description": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro made his debut on the world's biggest stage for world leaders, the U.N.
