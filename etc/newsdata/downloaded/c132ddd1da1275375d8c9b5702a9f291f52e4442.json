A low for me was last Christmas, when I had no money to buy my son a Christmas present.\n\n\u201cThe \u00adsituation we have today is \u00adunacceptable.

I\u2019m blind and I\u2019ve been locked out of employment since I had a brain injury five years ago.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t have to be this way though. Social security benefits should be enough so that people can live a dignified life and \u00addisabled people should be given support to access employment.\n\nPeter Kelly, director of The Poverty Alliance, said: \u201cAll across \u00adScotland people are coming together to highlight the problem of poverty and show what we can do to overcome the barriers that lock so many people in it.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nA new report has warned that Scotland's fight against poverty is in danger of \u201cunravelling\u201d unless action is taken across government.\n\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation raised concern in a report on poverty over the 20 years of Scottish devolution.\n\nPoverty rates are almost four percentage points lower than when the Scottish Parliament opened.
