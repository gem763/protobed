A handful of Midwestern targets were critical to Trump\u2019s general election success in 2016.\n\nJim Zogby, who co-chairs the DNC\u2019s ethnic counsel, a group that represents people across different ethnic, racial, national origin, and religious identities, says he has been pushing Perez and other party leaders to expand its outreach to voters in the same areas that Trump successfully captured: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and\u2014a Democratic sore spot in post-2016 politics\u2014Wisconsin.\n\nBut that outreach to the committee has fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cIn Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, if we do events in those states that focuses on everyone else but them, that breeds resentment,\u201d Zogby said. \u201cThat\u2019s why [former Vice President Joe] Biden and [Sen.] Bernie [Sanders I-VT] do well, because they talk to those folks.\u201d\n\nZogby was specifically referencing voters from Irish, Italian, Polish, Eastern Central European, Arab, and Armenian-American communities highly concentrated in the Midwest.\n\n\u201cI am frustrated beyond belief at the sheer neglect of the constituencies I represent,\u201d he added.\n\nZogby\u2019s chief concern\u2014raised by several other current DNC members who spoke with The Daily Beast\u2014is that the Trump campaign is already reaching swing voters while the Democratic Party is overwhelmingly focused on expanding their existing base.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a general unease right now among operatives and others who believe the DNC is not doing enough to build out the infrastructure before the next election,\u201d one DNC member said, who requested to speak anonymously about internal party conversations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deep concern that while we\u2019re turned inwards, the Trump campaign is already out there talking to general election voters.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Trump swept much of the Midwest by razor-thin margins, winning Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania by less than 2 percent. Pennsylvania and Michigan had not voted for a Republican president since 1988, while Wisconsin had not gone for the GOP since 1984. In Ohio, he successfully flipped areas that previously went for Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012.\n\nNow, less than six months away from the Iowa caucuses, the DNC has managed to escape the kind of public criticism that split progressives and moderates into two groups after the 2016 primary. But that veil of optimism could be shifting as new battles pop up, now centering more around some concerns that they are not effectively reaching voters who preferred the president last time around.\n\n\"Donald Trump is in general election mode while we\u2019re still in primary mode. We see it in Ohio,\u201d David Pepper, who chairs the state\u2019s Democratic Party said. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely carpet-bombing Ohio online. We\u2019re doing our best to respond.\u201d\n\nPepper doesn\u2019t see that as a Perez problem, but more of a function of running a competitive, oversized primary against an incumbent who\u2019s playing the general election game. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the DNC for that problem. It\u2019s a bigger issue that that,\u201d he said.\n\nPepper pointed to states like Ohio that house hundreds of thousands of voters who went for Trump and also a Democrat down-ballot, like Sherrod Brown, the progressive senator who successfully won a third term in 2018. In his view, presidential candidates won\u2019t be targeting those same voters in the Democratic primary, so state parties have to do their part to pick up the slack.\n\n\u201cI think the roles of state parties, especially swing states, should be to talk to the same voters Trump is talking to for the general election,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait until next May to make the case if he\u2019s already talking to them now.\u201d\n\nIn Wisconsin, state party Chair Ben Wikler pushed back on the critique that the DNC is mostly paying lip service in the state that Hillary Clinton famously skipped in 2016, saying that efforts have ramped up since June.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not only building the bench of organizers of communities of color in the Milwaukee area but building a bench of voters who can persuade voters in places where bringing down Trump\u2019s margin can narrow his path to victory in 2020,\u201d Wikler said. \u201cAnyone who thinks that Democrats aren\u2019t fighting for voters in Wisconsin of every color and creed isn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d Wikler pointed to the state party\u2019s recent hiring of an organizer in rural Northern Wisconsin, a position he said is funded by the DNC. Wisconsin Democrats have a total of eight regional organizers who are working across the state.\n\nThe DNC has created a War Room, a joint effort with communications, research, and digital departments, who drive rapid response against Trump with daily email blasts, among other initiatives. They\u2019ve also built \u201cthe world\u2019s most comprehensive research file on Donald Trump,\u201d an official noted. The official pointed to a news story outlining the communications infrastructure they are building in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Ohio.\n\n\"At the DNC we take nothing for granted: we're making historic early investments, working every day to hold Trump accountable for his broken promises and laying the infrastructure now to ensure our eventual nominee defeats Trump in 2020,\u201d David Bergstein, the DNC\u2019s director of battleground state communications, said.\n\nStill, a DNC official directly familiar with battleground states\u2019 efforts suggested all the messaging hasn\u2019t trickled down to much action on the ground level yet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some deep concerns brewing under the surface. Nothing that\u2019s spilled into the public yet,\u201d the member said. \u201cWhere\u2019s all the support? They keep talking about the calories coming. People generally are feeling Trump is beating us on all fronts right now.\u201d\n\nThe national party\u2019s fundraising woes continue to present a problem when up against the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign\u2019s significant advantage, multiple members said.\n\n\u201cThe DNC is cash-strapped right now,\u201d one member said plainly.\n\nIn June, the Republican National Committee more than doubled the DNC\u2019s fundraising haul, totaling $20.7 million to $8.5 million, respectively. The DNC also spent nearly as much money as it brought in, burning through $7.5 million during the same month it hosted its first presidential debate in Miami.\n\n\u201cOur permanent, data-driven ground game never left in these battleground states and we already have triple the amount of staff in these states than we did at this point during the 2016 cycle,\u201d a senior RNC official said about the Repulican Party\u2019s investment specifically in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\n\nFor other DNC members, the issue stretches beyond battlegrounds into Perez\u2019s inability to adapt to the changing concerns of new Democratic Party voters.\n\nThe latest example of that tension spilled into public view in recent days, when the committee nixed the possibility of a separate climate debate during its summer meeting in San Francisco, a move Perez backed that frustrated Democratic presidential campaigns, according to sources familiar.\n\nOver the weekend, a committee vote rejected a plan that would allow 2020 Democrats to participate in third-party debates. Perez has consistently said that no single issue should take priority in a neutral Democratic primary.\n\nBut after the decision became public, one DNC member said they were contacted by staffers representing nearly every 2020 campaign over the weekend who expressed concerns about the move.\n\n\u201cThey feel that Tom really mishandled this,\u201d the DNC member who spoke to presidential campaigns said. \u201cIt puts them in a position where they have to say they don\u2019t agree with the leader of the party. There\u2019s no doubt people are starting to sour on his leadership.\u201d\n\nA separate official said it speaks directly to Perez\u2019s inability to deviate from rules when appropriate, which they said makes the goal of party unity increasingly difficult, as well as a tendency to push established topics instead of branching out to areas of increased interest like climate.\n\nSpeaking about climate activists from the Sunrise Movement, the DNC member said, \u201cWhat happened to the Sunrise kids on Saturday was wrong, wrong, wrong. This is a Tom thing. It\u2019s a power struggle, it\u2019s not about politics.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWhere\u2019s all the support?
