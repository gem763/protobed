The state will spend about $2,500 to replace the image of the Confederate battle flag with the Maryland flag.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just was really very disappointed,\u201d Jones, who serves on the board and cast the lone dissenting vote, said in a recent interview. \u201cI know that people interpret things different ways, but there was a reason why I felt so strongly about that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJones said the language on the plaque, which was written during the height of the civil rights movement, sympathizes with the Confederates.\n\nThe plaque reads in part: \u201cIn commemorating the centennial of that great struggle between the citizens of the temporarily divided nation in the 1860s the Maryland Civil War Centennial Commission did not attempt to decide who was right and who was wrong, or to make decisions on other controversial issues. . . . By doing so it seeks to pay tribute to those who fought and died. As well as to the citizens who, during the Civil War, tried to do their duty as they saw it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a May letter to the board, Jones said that message \u201cdoes not seek to correctly document history but instead sympathizes with Confederate motivations and \u00admemorializes Confederate soldiers. History clearly tells us that there was a right and a wrong side of the Civil War.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJones said the other members of the board \u2014 Lt. Gov. Boyd K. Rutherford (R), Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) and Laura Mears, the chairwoman of the Maryland Historical Trust \u2014 \u201cmissed the point.\u201d The vote was taken by email.\n\nThe vote was the latest action by elected officials across the country trying to confront the nation\u2019s racist history and deal with the monuments and symbols that represent that past. In the wake of the deadly August 2017 \u00adwhite-supremacist rally in Charlottesville opposing the removal of a Confederate statue, Maryland removed the statue of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney from the lawn of the State House. Taney was the author of the 1857 Dred Scott decision that upheld slavery and denied citizenship to black people.\n\nAD\n\nRutherford suggested removing the logo of the Civil War Centennial Commission, which features a Confederate flag, and replacing it with the Maryland flag, \u201cwhile still acknowledging the sacrifices Marylanders made during the Civil War.\u201d In a letter to the board, Rutherford called the Confederate flag \u201ca divisive symbol\u201d that \u201chas no place in this or any state house.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe cannot erase our history, nor should we,\u201d wrote Rutherford, who is African American. \u201cIt is important that we remember, and teach future generations, that ours was a divided state. . . . We have an obligation to represent our history appropriately.\u201d\n\nBut Rutherford did not recommend removing or altering the inscription on the plaque that Jones found offensive.\n\nAD\n\nMonica Martinez, an assistant professor of American studies at Brown University, said that while some may view the board\u2019s vote as a compromise, she wouldn\u2019t classify it that way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gesture that at least acknowledges that there has been conflict over what the flag symbolizes and its use in the resurgence of white terror groups,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not being willing to look at the language of how the Civil War and the role of Confederate soldiers is being interpreted for the public in this plaque sends a signal that we have a long way to go before we are actually able to confront not just the history itself but the ways and attempts to portray the history in a way that still causes harm.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJones said she has received numerous calls and emails from colleagues who supported her effort. She said she is unaware of a way to revisit the issue, especially before the plaque is altered.\n\nAD\n\nJones, who won election after a divisive battle in the House of Delegates, said she had often walked by the plaque on the first floor of the State House but had never read it until this year. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt the need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t want to question the motivations of the other board members but hoped that in the future, they will make a greater effort to \u201clook at both sides,\u201d particularly why she and others would view the language as \u201churtful.\u201d", "description": "Adrienne A.
