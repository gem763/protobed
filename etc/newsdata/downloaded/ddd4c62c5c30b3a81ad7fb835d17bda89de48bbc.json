John doesn\u2019t like apples and seeing them sold with other fruits upsets him,\u201d she explains, as John first shouts at the fruit and then physically attacks it.\n\n\u201cThis behaviour seems ridiculous, but would it be any stranger like this?\u201d she asks, cutting to John screaming at the shopkeeper \u201cbecause he is black\u201d.\n\nThe cartoon also shows a white man ripping off a Muslim woman\u2019s hijab and punching her to the ground, and an elderly white driver refusing to let the black shopkeeper from before board a bus.\n\n\u201cIf you observe or experience any threatening or hateful behaviour, even if it isn\u2019t a crime, you should contact the police,\u201d the narrator instructs.\n\nAnother cartoon shows a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girl at a kindergarten \u2014 which do not exist in Britain\u2019s mainstream education system \u2014 approaching a boy of Middle Eastern appearance and telling him, \u201cstop playing with those [toys], you\u2019re going to make the toys dirty like your skin\u201d in a strange accent, prompting him to burst into tears.\n\nThe girl then explains to her concerned teacher that her father \u201csays that we should not play with people like him because they are different.\u201d\n\nSupporting Hate Crime Awareness Week.
