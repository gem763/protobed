When asked to predict how versatile the Bulldog defense would be in 2019, he said \u201cI think this is a team that can wreak havoc this year, just do damage to different teams.\u201d\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Louis Cine runs back an interception.

The Georgia defense ranked 15th in the country in team defense last year, but they were 10th in the Southeastern Conference in interceptions and second-to-last in tackles-for-loss, with 65. Due to those subpar statistics, Georgia\u2019s havoc rate in 2018 was just 15.6%, 73rd best in the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, the two teams that contended for last season\u2019s national championship boasted far more disruptive defenses: Alabama created havoc on 21.2% of its plays while Clemson did so on 21% in 2018.\n\nThe glaring gap between Georgia and college football\u2019s current royalty made it clear that the Bulldog defense needed to inflict more chaos. So began the Kirby Smart listening tour of 2019.\n\nIn the weeks following the Sugar Bowl, Smart and his staff studied the 10 programs with the highest havoc rates last season, eventually expanding their analysis to include any program whose tackles-for-loss total ranked in the top-20. They made stops at several universities, including Clemson, Michigan and Miami, whose 24.2% havoc rate in 2018 was the best in college football, and peppered their peers with questions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do some of the things they do and we\u2019re trying to put guys in position to do that,\u201d said Smart at the beginning of spring training in mid-March. Specifically, he wants his defense to wreak havoc on at least 20% of its plays.\n\nTo get the defense to increase the frequency of its havoc plays by more than 30%, Smart knew he had to try new tactics\u2014hence the locker-room dialogues. Players, who previously heard Smart wax on about the importance of stuffing the run, took to the havoc mantra quickly. Within the first three games of the 2019 season, Georgia\u2019s havoc rate has soared by over 58%.\n\n\u201cI kid you not. Literally every day we stand up, we chart how many yards we give up, we talk about havoc, every day,\u201d said Reed, who returned a fumble for a touchdown against Murray State. \u201cWhen you preach that, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nAnd happen it has. Georgia\u2019s defense has tallied 47 negative plays, 20 of which came against Arkansas State last week. Its havoc rate, currently at 24.7%, has trended upwards every week.\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs players celebrate after recovering a fumble.

Almost every Bulldog on the roster has taken snaps this season\u201485 played in Georgia\u2019s 63-17 win over Murray State and 86 saw action in last Saturday\u2019s 55-0 shutout of Arkansas State. That suggests that any player on the defense is capable of causing a disruption.\n\nThat could be a problem for Notre Dame, because the Fighting Irish offense is particularly susceptible to giving up yards. Though Notre Dame went undefeated in the regular season in 2018, its opponents successfully executed havoc plays 18% of the time--two percentage points higher than the national average.\n\nThis year the Irish offense has been less prone to havoc\u201414% of its plays against Louisville and New Mexico yielded negative progress. That\u2019s not saying much, however, considering those opponents have the No. 29- and No. 130-ranked defenses, respectively. Georgia\u2019s havoc-heavy defense, meanwhile, is ranked ninth.\n\nAs Notre Dame quarterback Ian Book predicts about Saturday\u2019s game, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hostile environment.\u201d\n\nWrite to Laine Higgins at laine.higgins@wsj.com", "description": "As No. 3 Georgia prepares to host No. 7 Notre Dame on Saturday night, creating more havoc has become the central goal of the Bulldogs\u2019 defense in 2019.", "authors": ["Laine Higgins"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108947/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
