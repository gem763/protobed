Campaigners vowed it would go ahead despite police ruling the rally illegal.\n\nIn the past, thousands of people have defied police and staged mass rallies without permission, often peaceful at the start but becoming violent at night.\n\nThe trigger for unrest in Hong Kong had been a now-withdrawn proposal to allow extradition to mainland China, as well as Taiwan and Macau. The case of a Hong Kong man accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan before fleeing back to the city was held up as an example of why it was needed.\n\nLate on Friday the man, Chan Tong-kai, who is jailed in Hong Kong for money laundering, wrote to Lam saying he would \"surrender himself to Taiwan\" over his alleged involvement in the case upon his release, which could be as soon as next week.\n\nLam said in an interview on Saturday with broadcaster RTHK that it was a relief as it could bring an end to the case.\n\nShe also said that police had used appropriate force in handling the protests, and were responding to protesters' violence, amid criticism of heavy-handed tactics.\n\nMore than 2,600 people have been arrested since the protests escalated in June.\n\nProtesters' demands have, since then, swelled far beyond opposing the extradition bill, to take in broader concerns that Beijing is eroding freedoms granted when Britain handed the city back to China in 1997.\n\nChina denies the accusation and has blamed foreign nations such as the United States and Britain for inciting the unrest.", "description": "Following a week of relative calm, Sunday's march will test the strength of the pro-democracy movement.", "authors": ["Grace Shao"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106190842-1571453946831gettyimages-1176122539.jpeg?v=1571439644", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
