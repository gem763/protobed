So there's no relationship.\"\n\nLewis partnered with Tinder after publicising his dating woes.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nThe potty-mouthed Scotsman also opened up about his time with Elton John and his family on his yacht.\n\n\"It ended up just me and him showing each other songs we liked on his iPad\", said Lewis.\n\n\"Which is something I've done with my friends with the aux cable in the car, but every two minutes I'd look up and go 'Oh, you're f*****g Elton John...cool!\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"It's crazy. But he was lovely, and he said if anything you ever ever want to talk about, or need advice, just give me a call.\n\n\"The whole thing was just brilliant.\n\nHe called Elton's family \"lovely\" and said his children were \"the most polite children I've ever met in my life\".\n\nWhen asked if he took a souvenir from Elton's yacht such as loo roll, Lewis joked: \"I should have done! I would have made a killing from that!\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLewis also revealed that Elton recommended to him that next time he tours, he should perform a song with just him and the piano, because \"people would like to see it\".\n\nTaking on this advice, Lewis is now learning the piano (but not from Elton).\n\n\"The thing is, I'm lazy as f***. If I didn't start playing guitar when I was nine I'd have gone 'f*** that, too many strings'.\n\n(Image: Justin Ng/Retna/Avalon)\n\n\"But I'm going give it a go and to try my best and think 'remember, Elton John said you should do this. Sir Elton.'\"\n\nRegarding his feud with Noel Gallagher, Lewis said it wasn't really as serious as people took it.\n\n\"I didn't sense any actual animosity from his side\", he said.\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\n\"It's totally cool I like him. He doesn't have a vendetta against me. He's a lovely man.\n\n\"I met him Madrid when we played the same festival.\n\n\"He said to me 'keep up the good work!\" which I thought was a bit sarcastic. But other than that, love him.\"\n\nLewis took home 'Q Best Track' at the awards.", "description": "The Someone You Loved singer revealed all on his love life, the advice Elton John gave to him, and his feud with Noel Gallagher", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Redferns", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Justin Ng Retna Avalon", "Gc Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638032.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Q-Awards-2019-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
