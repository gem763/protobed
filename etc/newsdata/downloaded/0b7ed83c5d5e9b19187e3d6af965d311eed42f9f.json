The reason we got this far is because Jamie united us and made us one team.\"\n\nThat unity was displayed when the players were asked to name their favorite moment of the tournament.\n\nCenter Ryoto Nakamura praised the work of Yoshitaka Tokunaga and the four other players who did not get any playing time. He said their support of the team's cause in training and their efforts relaying messages and as water boys during the games were important.\n\nProp Keita Inagaki talked of a scrum in the first half against Ireland when the Japan pack forced a penalty, while flanker Pieter Labuschagne said Inagaki's try against Scotland, his first in a test match, was the highlight because the \"whole team did their job\" in the build-up.\n\nFour years ago, the Japan Rugby Football Union failed to ride the momentum of Japan's success in England and the players spoke of their hope that this time around things would be different.\n\n\"When we came back from New Zealand after the 2011 tournament there were only two or three reporters so it's unbelievable to see so many of you here today,\" hooker Shota Horie said of the press conference which was broadcast live on TV.\n\n\"It's our mission to work toward the next World Cup and keep up the popularity of rugby. What matters is how much stronger and better we can get from here on.\"\n\nFlyhalf Yu Tamura, who broke a rib during the defeat to South Africa, said he had \"realized through this tournament that we're capable of doing our very best and becoming the national team that everyone admires and wants to join.\"\n\n\"We've set goals and achieved them. Not every team can do that and I'm proud.\"\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Japan coach Jamie Joseph said Monday the team's impressive work ethic played a major role in the hosts making a run to the Rugby World Cup's last eight for the first time.
