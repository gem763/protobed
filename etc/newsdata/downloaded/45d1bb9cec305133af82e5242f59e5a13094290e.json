Brent crude oil jumped 13% yesterday to almost $68 a barrel after drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. The US is blaming Iran, who denies responsibility. Sasol's share price rallied 10% in reaction. The rand weakened to R14.65/$. 2. The overwhelming majority of Naspers shareholders chose to get shares in its new tech company Prosus, rather than more Naspers shares. Investors representing 96.3% of Naspers shares went for the default option: They received one Prosus share for every Naspers N share they held. Alternatively, they could have opted to get 0.36986 new Naspers shares for every Naspers share they owned. 3. President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised workers that government will do more to clamp down on the illegal importation of Chinese clothing and textiles which undercuts locally manufactured goods. He told the Southern African Clothing & Textile Workers\u2019 Union that the SA Revenue Service has been ramping up its investigative and enforcement capacity. 4. The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) received a loan of R7bn from the Brics bank. The SA government provided a guarantee for the loan. The money will be used to upgrade toll roads. 5. The introduction of 5kg gas cylinders, and strong demand from hospitals for its healthcare products, helped to counter the impact of a shrinking SA manufacturing sector on Afrox's revenue. South Africa's largest gas and welding company saw revenue rise by 3.3% to R3bn for the six months to end-June. Thanks in part to cost cutting, headline earnings per share rose by 7% to 111.3c.\n\n13 of the biggest box-office flops of 2019 so far\n\nReported by Travis Clark\n\nThe biggest box-office loser of the year so far has been actor Matthew McConaughey, who had two major bombs in 2019.\n\nMcConaughey's January release, \"Serenity,\" co-starring Anne Hathaway, grossed a rough $8.5 million and had a production budget of $25 million. Harmony Korine's \"The Beach Bum,\" starring McConaughey, opened with $1.8 million in March, which was the worst opening for a wide release on over 1,000 screens at the time, and one of the worst openings of the actor's career.\n\nWhile STX Entertainment is flying high with \"Hustlers\" in theaters, STX released two bombs in two weekends earlier this year: the animated \"UglyDolls\" and \"Poms,\" which had the worst opening for a movie in over 2,700 theaters.\n\nThe first major bomb of the year, director Joe Cornish's \"The Kid Who Would Be King,\" opened just $7 million in January and ultimately made $32 million worldwide. It was made for $60 million.\n\nEven some superhero movies have crashed and burned. \"Hellboy\" failed to spark excitement last month due to a poor release date, awful reviews, and other factors. It's made just $21 million and was made for $50 million. And the \"X-Men\" dud \"Dark Phoenix\" was a huge misfire.\n\nThe latest flop is Warner Bros.' \"The Goldfinch,\" which had the worst opening of the year so far over the weekend for a movie in over 2,500 theaters.\n\nBelow are 13 box-office flops this year, in order of release date:\n\n\"Replicas\"\n\nRelease date: January 11\n\nOpening weekend: $2,375,325\n\nTotal global gross: $4,046,429\n\nProduction budget: $30 million\n\nRotten Tomatoes critic score: 10%\n\nWhat critics said: \"The filmmakers manage to avoid every potentially interesting choice for far dumber, and far more inexplicable, conclusions.\" - Los Angeles Times\n\n\"The Kid Who Would Be King\"\n\nRelease date: January 25\n\nTotal global gross: $32,097,473\n\nProduction budget: $60 million\n\nRotten Tomatoes critic score: 90%\n\nWhat critics said: \"Cornish is offering a kind of movie they just don't make anymore - expansive live-action adventure tales unabashedly aimed at young people, not the adults charged with taking them to the cinema.\" - Vulture\n\n\"Serenity\"\n\nRelease date: January 25\n\nOpening weekend: $4,415,403\n\nTotal global gross: $8,547,045\n\nProduction budget: $25 million\n\nRotten Tomatoes critic score: 19%\n\nWhat critics said: \"What an infuriating mess the makers of Serenity have unloaded on an unsuspecting public.
