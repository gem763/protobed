Other recent policies have also made it harder for the children to seek asylum in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to the U.S., Mexico has experienced a similar uptick in the number of migrant children attempting to enter its country, The New York Times reported. Roughly 40,500 children were detained by the Mexican government this fiscal year.\n\nIn Mexico, by law, the children are immediately placed into the custody of the country's national child protection agency, which finds housing for the children in accommodating shelters.", "description": "The U.S. detained more unaccompanied minors trying to cross the nation's southwestern border in the past year than ever recorded, according to\u00a0newly released figures from the Trump administration.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/immigration_migrantchildren_061814getty2_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
