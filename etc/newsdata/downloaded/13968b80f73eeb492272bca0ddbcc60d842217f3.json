Cooley therefore respectfully requests permission to withdraw as Counsel for Ms. Holmes.\"\n\nLombard said in an email to CNBC: \"We don't' have any further comment.\"\n\nThe motion states Holmes has been informed of the status of the case.\n\nHolmes' criminal defense attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHolmes was in court this week for a hearing related to her criminal trial with co-defendant Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani. In that case, Holmes and Balwani are charged with nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They each face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHolmes is scheduled to appear in court on November 4.", "description": "Lawyers representing Elizabeth Holmes in a civil lawsuit against Theranos and Walgreens filed a motion to withdraw representation, saying Holmes has not paid them.", "authors": ["Yasmin Khorram"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103047382-20150928-2-1675-6.jpg?v=1570218911", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
