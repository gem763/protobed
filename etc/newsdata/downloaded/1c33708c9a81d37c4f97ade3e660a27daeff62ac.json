Katie Hill to fight revenge porn upon leaving Congress", "language": "en", "text": "Over the weekend, Rep. Katie Hill, a first-term Democrat from California, announced that she will leave Congress by the end of the week after nude images of herself were published online without her consent. Hill has admitted to having a consensual relationship with a campaign staffer. In a letter announcing her resignation on Sunday, she said she will focus on fighting \u201crevenge porn\u201d after she leaves Congress.\n\n\u201cThose of you who know me personally know that I\u2019m a fighter,\u201d Hill wrote. \u201cNow, my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light.\u201d\n\nEarlier last week, Politico reported that the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into Hill over the allegations of improper sexual relationships. That investigation will end as soon as Hill formally leaves office, but those nude images, originally published by the right-wing outlet RedState and the Daily Mail, will follow her around the internet for much longer.\n\nIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\n\n\n\nSee my official statement below. pic.twitter.com/nG97RQIwvO \u2014 Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) October 27, 2019\n\nAfter the accusations first arose, Hill released a statement blaming her \u201cabusive husband\u201d who she is in the middle of divorcing for the controversy. The allegations included a consensual three-person sexual relationship with a female campaign staffer and her estranged-husband and one with her male legislative director, Graham Kelly. There is no evidence that proves any impropriety with Kelly.\n\n\u201cDuring the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign,\u201d Hill said last week. \u201cI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologize. I wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.\u201d\n\nIn her resignation letter, Hill wrote that she would pursue all \u201cavailable legal options\u201d for the nonconsensual dissemination of her nude images. Hill has yet to announce what kind of action she plans to take to fight the use of revenge porn, and her staff did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge regarding any future plans.", "description": "Rep.
