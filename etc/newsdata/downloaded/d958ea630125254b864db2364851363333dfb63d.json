Doing so doesn\u2019t always have to cost a lot of money or take up a lot of time.\n\nThis week Tim Ferris shared a post from Alexandra Franzen detailing \u201c50 ways to be ridiculously generous \u2014and feel ridiculously good,\u201d most of the ideas won\u2019t break the bank to do, and many also only take a few minutes so they won\u2019t take a ton of your day to execute.\n\nWhile I definitely recommend checking out the full list for your own motivation, here are a few of my favourites that are entirely free:\n\nFind a local or street library near you and donate a book. Can\u2019t find one? Start one.\n\nBe like Diane von Furstenberg and start your day by sending out one email specifically designed to help somebody else \u2014 without directly benefiting you at all \u2014 before you do anything else. Make introductions, send some encouragement, offer a helpful resource or link.\n\nProwl through your closet and donate some treasures to charity. You\u2019ll de-clutter your wardrobe and help a struggling lady look like a star at her next job interview.\n\nGet outlandishly excited about a small piece of good news from a friend. (\u201cYou did WHAT? Just like THAT? You\u2019re AMAZING!\u201d) Model the kind of unbridled enthusiasm that you want to see in the world.\n\nMake an 8Tracks or Spotify playlist for your favourite human. Extra credit: give your playlist a special \u201creason\u201d or \u201ctheme,\u201d like, \u201cListen to this while you\u2019re getting ready for your first date with Zach!\u201d or, \u201cPump-yourself-up music to play before you deliver your TEDx Talk. You\u2019re going to do GREAT.\u201d\n\nAgain, the idea here isn\u2019t to spend a ton of money. While being \u201cgenerous\u201d can obviously mean cutting some large checks, it can also mean just being generous with your time or your praise.\n\nYou\u2019re also not restricted to just doing things on this list. Think of something simple you can do to improve the life of someone around you and do it. Mow your neighbour\u2019s lawn while you\u2019re mowing your own, or just pick their paper up off the driveway and walk it to their front door.", "description": "We all know that being generous and helping people makes us feel good.
