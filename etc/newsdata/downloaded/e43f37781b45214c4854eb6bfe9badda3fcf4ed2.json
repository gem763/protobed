USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Alliance of American Football suspended operations on Tuesday with two weeks still left to play in its inaugural season.\n\nThis is just the latest reminder that it's tough out there for start-up pro football leagues. So, good luck XFL. A re-imagined version of the 2001 failed XFL will begin play in 2020. It likely will be greeted with big TV ratings and significant fan interest at its launch, only to have those hopes and dreams crushed by April.\n\nDating back to World War II, only one start-up outdoor professional football league survived. Entering the NFL's 100th season, it exists as the American Football Conference. Back in 1960, the American Football League went head-to-head with the National Football League and succeeded, forcing a merger between the two leagues and spawning the unofficial national holiday that is the Super Bowl.\n\nWhether these leagues were direct competitors to the NFL, or just trying to fill a void in the football calendar in the time-frame after the Super Bowl, these leagues provide a cautionary tale for anybody thinking about getting another pro football league off the ground.\n\nAlliance of American Football\n\nExistence: Eight weeks (2019).\n\nWhat happened? The AAF jumped out to strong TV ratings, but financial problems emerged early and Tom Dundon \u2014 who also owns the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes \u2014 stepped in with a $250 million investment. Six weeks later, after trying to secure cooperation from the NFL Players' Association to use young players from NFL rosters in AAF games, Dundon pulled the plug on The Alliance.\n\nJohn Wolford and the Arizona Hot Shots won the last AAF game, beating the San Antonio Commanders 23-6.

It played with four teams in 2014 and just three in 2015. The league had hoped to be a developmental league for the NFL, playing its games in the fall and ending its season in November, which is normally a time when injuries can take a toll on an NFL roster. However, without official NFL support, the league never became profitable and closed operations before it could complete its second season.\n\nUnited Football League\n\nExistence: 4 seasons (2009-12)\n\nWhat happened? A rare start-up football league to try to play its games in the fall, the UFL nearly benefited from a prolonged lockout in 2011 as the NFL and NFLPA worked out a new collective bargaining agreement. Instead, the NFL lockout was resolved in time for the 2011 season and the UFL wouldn't be the only pro football option for TV networks that autumn. The UFL played the 2011 season, but its 2012 season was cut short after four weeks of play as the league succumbed to financing issues.\n\nXFL\n\nExistence: 1 season (2001)\n\nWhat happened? Triggered by the marketing power of Vince McMahon and what is now the WWE (plus a partnership with NBC), the XFL opened to huge TV ratings. Those ratings quickly deteriorated as the season went along. Billed as \"the toughest football ever played,\" the XFL failed to live up to expectations. It was just bad football, featuring trash-talking TV commentators such as Jesse Ventura (then the governor of Minnesota) and borderline-inappropriate cheerleaders. Less than a month after it played its championship game, the XFL folded after massive financial losses. Only the AAF failed faster than the XFL in 2001. Despite all of this, McMahon is reincarnating the XFL for a 2020 launch.\n\nThe San Francisco Demons' Terrance Joseph (29) breaks up a pass intended for Las Vegas Outlaws wide receiver Mike Furrey (82) in an XFL game in 2001.

This start-up lasted the longest of any, thanks to the backing of the NFL. The original \"World League\" featured three Europe-based teams, one in Canada and six teams in the U.S. This incarnation lasted two seasons and the league was put on hiatus until being brought back as NFL Europe in 1995 with each of its six teams based in Europe (it was rebranded as NFL Europa for its final season in 2007). The NFL assigned developmental players to NFL Europe teams, and the league's track record for producing NFL talent was tremendous. Pro Football Hall of Famer Kurt Warner is the most notable alum. Others included QBs Jake Delhomme, Brad Johnson and Jon Kitna, LB James Harrison, DT La'Roi Glover, return specialist/WR Dante Hall, and kickers David Akers and Adam Vinatieri. Actor Terry Crews also played in the league. In 2007, as part of a new strategy to \"make the NFL more accessible on a global scale,\" the NFL shut down NFL Europa and focused on the International Series of games in London.\n\nLawrence Phillips of the Barcelona Dragons runs against the Frankfurt Galaxy in an NFL Europe game in 1999.

Playing its games in the spring, the USFL wasn't a direct competitor to the NFL. However, it was competing for talent. The first salvo was the signing of 1982 Heisman winner Herschel Walker. While Walker never became a Pro Football Hall of Famer, four players enshrined in Canton did begin their pro football careers in the USFL: Jim Kelly, Steve Young, Reggie White and Gary Zimmerman. A relatively modest beginning for the USFL got a huge jolt when Donald Trump bought the New Jersey Generals. Trump worked to convince other USFL owners to move its league games to the fall. With the USFL planning a 1986 move to fall games, Trump convinced USFL owners to file an anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL. This did not go well. The USFL was awarded $1 in damages and the league was done.\n\nDoug Flutie speaks while sitting next to Donald Trump as a New Jersey Generals news conference.

Aligned as a direct competitor to the NFL, the WFL signed a number of notable NFL players, including a trio from the Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins: Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and Paul Warfield. The league's first season ended with the league champions \u2014 the Birmingham Americans \u2014 having their uniforms repossessed. Despite that obvious financial trouble, the WFL came back for more in 1975. It didn't survive long enough to hold another title game, folding midway through its season.\n\nContinental Football League\n\nExistence: 5 seasons (1965-69)\n\nWhat happened? This is where Bill Walsh got his first head coaching gig, coaching the San Jose Apaches in 1967. The Continental Football League survived until the AFL-NFL merger, when teams folded and the league was no more.\n\nAll-American Football Conference\n\nExistence: 4 seasons (1946-49)\n\nWhat happened? The AAFC \u2014 like the American Football League after it \u2014 was a legitimate competitor to the NFL. For the 1950 season, three AAFC teams \u2014 the Baltimore Colts (a separate franchise than the team currently located in Indianapolis), Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers \u2014 were merged into the NFL. The Browns \u2014 winners of all four of the AAFC championship games \u2014 were an instant powerhouse in the NFL. Defeating the defending NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles in a famous 1950 season-opener, then winning the league title that season and playing in the NFL championship game in seven of its first eight NFL seasons.\n\nPacific Coast Professional Football League\n\nExistence: 9 seasons (1940-49)\n\nWhat happened? The PCPFL operated mostly during a time when the furthest west NFL franchises were the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers. In 1941, Jackie Robinson played in the PCPFL as a running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Before becoming NFL pioneers with the LA Rams, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode \u2014 Robinson's teammates at UCLA \u2014 played for the Hollywood Bears. Popularity in the league decreased due to the Cleveland Rams' move to Los Angeles in 1946 as well as the presence of the AAFC's Los Angeles Dons.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jim Reineking on Twitter @jimreineking.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
