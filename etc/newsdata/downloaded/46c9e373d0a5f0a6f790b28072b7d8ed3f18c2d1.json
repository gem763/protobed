He also asked Zelensky to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump's request to Zelensky about the Bidens was so alarming to a US intelligence official that it prompted them to file an official whistleblower complaint accusing the president of using the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in a US election.\n\nBut his request to Morrison is a little murkier because it deals with an ongoing Justice Department inquiry in the matter and could therefore be viewed as falling more within the confines of Trump's power as the chief executive.\n\nAustralia played a unique role in the Russia probe. In late 2017, The Times reported that the FBI launched the Russia investigation after Alexander Downer, a top Australian diplomat, told US officials that the Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos boasted to him that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton's campaign in the form of \"thousands\" of emails.\n\nPapadopoulos told Downer he learned of the information from Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese academic who was last seen working as a professor in Rome before disappearing.\n\nThe FBI began investigating whether the Trump campaign was working with Russia soon after Downer reported his conversation with Papadopoulos.\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI last year. But in the months since, he's taken on an increasingly combative role and Trump's allies have joined him in suggesting, without proof, that Mifsud was planted by western intelligence operatives to entrap Papadopoulos and the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump's request to Morrison is emblematic of his long-held view that the Justice Department and the attorney general are political tools he can wield against his perceived enemies.\n\nIndeed, in his phone call with Zelensky in July, Trump repeatedly referred to both Barr and Giuliani as being his personal envoys and pressured the Ukrainian president to work with both to undermine the Russia investigation and the Bidens.\n\nLike it did with his call with Zelensky, The Times reported that the White House restricted access to the transcript of Trump's conversation with Morrison to a small group of the president's aides.\n\nTrump's call with Zelensky was the catalyst that prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump last week.\n\nAs part of that investigation, the House Intelligence Committee on Monday subpoenaed Giuliani for key documents connected to the call and his representation of Trump.\n\nGiuliani was mentioned 31 times in the whistleblower's complaint and was described as \"central figure\" in Trump's effort. The document said Barr \"appears to be involved as well.\"", "description": "Trump's request to Australia's PM is emblematic of his long-held view that the Justice Department is a political tool he can wield against his enemies.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a6ba903cf84106d018b4e89?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
