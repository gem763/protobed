This conversation has been edited.\n\nDavid Sims: What about the existing Harriet script did you keep, and what did you want to change?\n\nKasi Lemmons: I loved that it was an adventure story starring a young Harriet Tubman\u2013type character. But I wanted it to be about the actual Harriet Tubman, you know? I think Gregory Allen Howard had written the [original] script before the major scholarly biographies had been written about Harriet. In the \u201990s, there were three major biographies written. I did seven months of research on who she was, trying to bring as much specificity to the story as possible.\n\nSims: The film foregrounds Tubman\u2019s religious devoutness, and the role that dreams and visions played in her life. Those are things audiences may be less familiar with.\n\nLemmons: It certainly surprised and intrigued me. I didn\u2019t know how critical and essential [that intense spirituality] is to the Harriet Tubman story. When I started doing the research, I realized that you\u2019re really omitting something if you try and tell the story without that, because when she talks about herself, she talks about that.\n\nSims: It can be tough to sincerely engage with her beliefs\u2014she\u2019s telling people she\u2019s having visions of what\u2019s going to happen in the future\u2014and the film doesn\u2019t think about those ideas as fanciful.\n\nLemmons: I took a position, you know what I\u2019m saying? I took her word for it. She spoke about it very forcefully and with great certitude; there\u2019s no ambiguity in the way Harriet talked about [her visions].\n\nSims: Were there certain Hollywood clich\u00e9s about the depiction of slavery that you wanted to avoid?\n\nLemmons: There were a couple. Because it didn\u2019t feel authentic to this story, I didn\u2019t want a hundred slaves in a field picking cotton and a huge plantation. The Brodess family [who owned Tubman] had money problems\u2014they had a farm, they had 14 to 20 enslaved people, many of whom were from one family. So I really just wanted to talk about what it was like for the Ross family [Tubman\u2019s family] in that era and what it was like for the community of West Africans in the Chesapeake region.\n\nSims: The standard image of American slavery a lot of people have is more from the Deep South, whereas the film really communicates that Tubman was only a couple of hundred miles from the Northeast [in Dorchester County, Maryland].\n\nLemmons: Right. Being \u201csold South\u201d was the horror you tried to escape. Three of her sisters were sold South.", "description": "Kasi Lemmons on the mythos of Harriet Tubman and why the director\u2019s new film is like \u201c12 Years a Slave meets Django Unchained meets Wonder Woman\u201d", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/4130_D021_00044_RC/facebook.jpg?1572299659", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
