Peers are gearing up to attack the US operators for their dominance of the internet market and their attempts to shirk responsibility for offensive or dangerous content posted by users.\n\nWhich makes it interesting for Sir Nick Clegg, who, in his former guise as Lib Dem leader, would have been the first to demand that the US digital titans behave as responsible corporate citizens in the UK.\n\nClegg\u2019s main selling point to Facebook is not, however, his standing in this country. Even his most ardent admirer would have to admit his star has waned since the run-up to the 2010 election when Gordon Brown and David Cameron vied to tell the electorate how much they agreed with Nick.\n\nZuckerberg is actually paying for Clegg\u2019s specialist knowledge of the European Union at a time when one of Facebook\u2019s biggest fears is a clampdown from Brussels.\n\nLike Amazon and Twitter, it is a Janus corporation. It is hugely popular with millions of users, but has a dark side: the harmless pastime of posting pictures of puppies co-exists with far more sinister activities, unseen and unknown to innocent users.\n\nIn the spotlight: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\n\nThe company was this month fined a mere \u00a3500,000 over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which revolved around the harvesting of up to 87m users\u2019 data without their knowledge. That is the maximum fine the regulators could impose, even though to Zuckerberg, it is a laughably small amount that would take his company less than an hour to make in revenues.\n\nBut as Clegg and Zuckerberg both know, the penalties are only going to get bigger. Debacles like this one and last month\u2019s huge hack of user accounts have taken a toll on the share price, which is down around 15 per cent in the past year.\n\nNow at a turning point, at root Facebook\u2019s problems come down to a fight for its soul: an existential struggle between social and corporate values. On one side is \u2018friendship\u2019, the original motive for the site, versus profit, a powerful driver once the founders realised the billions to be made.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s solution is to try to return to its social networking roots and to dial down the prominence of advertising.\n\nIn the long-term, that must be right, because alienating users would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg, though in the short-term it risks a hit to revenues.\n\nIt may not be much consolation to Brits in the week of a sober Budget, but Sir Nick Clegg will have to work hard for those Silicon Valley millions.", "description": "Facebook is going to need all Clegg's skills if it is to have any chance of averting a fresh round of outrage when it reveals its latest multi-billion dollar sales.", "authors": ["Ruth Sunderland For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
