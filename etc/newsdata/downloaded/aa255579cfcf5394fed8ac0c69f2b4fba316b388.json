And I couldn\u2019t find him. I\u2019m finding giant wrestlers and football players and that. And then all of a sudden the door opened, the smoke came in, there\u2019s light. [He had a] proceeding hairline, shoulders this wide, everything was perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven his calves were coming through his clothing. Just muscular,\u201d he added. \u201cBlue eyes are staring into my soul. He was the real Terminator, and I was like, \u2018I hate this guy. He\u2019s too perfect. And if I loathe him, I\u2019m sure the world will.\u2019 He\u2019s not really, but he looks like something from a thousand years into the future.\u201d\n\nDOLPH LUNDGREN NEARLY KILLED SYLVESTER STALLONE WHILE FILMING 'ROCKY IV'\n\nStallone and Lundgren are good friends in real life, and have been for many years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an idea we\u2019ve come up with called 'The International,'\u201d he explained. \u201cIt deals with the UN but it\u2019s a different kind of UN, a little hardcore. There\u2019s a lot of action in it but it also really feeds into who Dolph is, because he is international. He\u2019s incredibly intelligent, so he\u2019s going to bring a different spin to the whole thing.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey recently starred together in the 2018 boxing drama \"Creed II\" in which they both reprised their \"Rocky\" characters from the 1985 movie.", "description": "Sometimes it's not all love between co-stars.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/stallone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
