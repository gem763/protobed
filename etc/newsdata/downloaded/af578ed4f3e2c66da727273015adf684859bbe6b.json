Turkish troops have been gathering on Turkey's side of the border since Monday night.\n\nThe US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Turkish forces were attacking near the border.\n\n\"The Turkish military is shelling one of our points on #SereKaniye Border with Turkey,\" the SDF said in a tweet late on Tuesday, referencing the key border town of Ras al-Ain. No injuries were reported.\n\n191008131745495\n\nIt was one of the places from which US troops withdrew on Monday, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials, who were not authorised to discuss details of military intelligence, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that there are between 5,000 and 10,000 Turkish troops along the border, apparently ready to go.\n\nThe officials said they expect the Turks to begin with air raids, followed by barrages from heavy artillery along the border and the movement of ground troops into Syria.\n\nAl Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Akcakale along Turkey's border with Syria, said: \"All evidence suggests that the operation could be imminent.\"\n\n\"Last night, we passed dozens of military vehicles heading in this direction - APCs [armoured personnel carriers], what we believe to be trucks carrying ammunition, and flatbed trucks transporting tanks,\" he said.\n\nStratford said buses of Free Syrian Army fighters were also transported from northern Aleppo in Syria across the border into Turkey on Tuesday.\n\n\"They are staying at a camp close by, and it's understood they will be joining the Turks in any sort of ground force operation,\" he added.\n\nCivilians already beleaguered by eight years of conflict are concerned.\n\n\"If war erupts, people will be vulnerable and displaced. Where should we go? You ask anyone they say we are not leaving. But eventually, we will be displaced,\" Summaiyah Mohammed, a Kurdish citizen in northern Syria, told Kurdish broadcaster Rudaw.\n\nMass prison break?\n\nJonathan Schanzer, a Syria scholar at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said even a limited Turkish incursion into northern Syria could quickly escalate.\n\n\"The president is doubling down on this - seems to be reversing course,\" Schanzer told AP. \"He's trying to convey to the American people that he's made the right decision. Of course, Erdogan is going to see this as a green light.\"\n\n191008163138301\n\nTamara Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy, also pointed out a frightening potential knock-on effect if Turkey is allowed to attack the Kurds: a mass prison break by ISIL detainees.\n\nCurrently, militia members are guarding a series of prisons in Syria holding thousands of ISIL fighters.\n\nThose guards would presumably rush to the front lines if their comrades faced the threat of the Turkish military machine.\n\n\"The only foreign policy issue that Americans really care about is terrorism and the fear of terrorism,\" Wittes told AP. \"The fear of ISIS 3.0 is very tangible and something that speaks to Americans.\"", "description": "Build-up of troops and tanks near border continues as president's aide warns allied forces will cross into Syria soon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/ed456ed3d9ba462c98c3d7798c1327f8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
