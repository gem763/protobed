European passenger car registrations rose 14.4% in September: ACEA\n\nMILAN (Reuters) - European car registrations rose 14.4% in September as the market recovered from the previous month's slump, led by robust gains at major brands Volkswagen (DE: ) and Renault (PA: ), industry data published on Wednesday showed.\n\nThe year-on-year increase was largely due to the low sales volumes recorded in September 2018, when registrations fell \"significantly\" following the introduction of WLTP emission standards, European car industry association ACEA said.\n\nWLTP standards measure the level of pollutants, CO2 emissions and fuel consumption for passenger cars.\n\nRegistrations rose to 1.29 million cars last month from 1.12 million a year earlier across the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, the Brussels-based association said in a statement.\n\nIn August, registration had dropped 8.6% year on year.\n\nFour of the five major European markets posted a double-digit registration growth last month, with Germany outpacing France, Spain and Italy, with a 22.2% gain, ACEA figure showed.\n\nRegistrations in Britain rose by a modest 1.3%, as \"Brexit-related uncertainties continued to affect consumer confidence,\" ACEA added.\n\nLast month, Volkswagen saw sales of its core brand rise 58.2% and Renault brand sales rose by 30.3%. FCA's Alfa Romeo (MI: ) registrations rose 25.9% year on year.\n\nJapan's Nissan (T: ) was one of the biggest losers among major brands, with a 7.0% decline in sales.\n\nAmong premium auto brands, Audi (DE: ) sales rose 38.8%, topping competitors such as Mercedes-Benz (DE: ) and Volvo, which saw their registrations rise 9.9% and 9.3%, respectively. BMW (DE: ) registrations dropped 6.6%, ACEA said.", "description": "European passenger car registrations rose 14.4% in September: ACEA", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6R0AQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
