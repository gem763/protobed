There are just 10 days until the U.K. is due to leave the European bloc on Oct. 31.(AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was headed for a showdown Tuesday with lawmakers who want to put the brakes on his drive to push his European Union divorce bill through the House of Commons in just three days and take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson said that if Parliament imposes a longer timetable and \"decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer,\" he will withdraw the bill and call a vote on holding a snap general election.\n\n\"I will in no way allow months more of this,\" said Johnson, who took power in July vowing that the U.K. will leave the EU on Oct. 31, come what may. His only hope of doing that is to pass the Brexit-implementing bill through Britain's fractious Parliament before then.\n\nJohnson's announcement piles pressure on lawmakers as they consider whether to approve the government's legislation, which would finally take Britain out of the EU \u2014 more than three years after voters opted to leave the bloc.\n\nThe bill faces two votes Tuesday, with lawmakers first being asked to approve it in principle, followed by a vote on the government's schedule for debate and possible amendments.\n\nJohnson said backing the bill would allow lawmakers to \"turn the page and allow this Parliament and this country to begin to heal and unite.\"\n\nWhile many analysts expect the bill to be approved, lawmakers may reject the three-day timetable because of concerns it doesn't provide enough time for scrutiny of the 115-page document, which sets out the terms of Britain's departure from the 28-nation bloc.\n\nMajor bills usually take weeks or months to pass through Parliament, giving time for line-by-line scrutiny by lawmakers.\n\nGreen lawmaker Caroline Lucas tweeted that lawmakers \"had more time to debate the Wild Animals in Circuses Act (affecting 19 animals) than they will to decide the future of 65 million people. It's hard to think of anything which better illustrates this Govt's contempt for people, Parliament & democracy.\"\n\nOminously for the government, some lawmakers who support the Brexit deal said they would vote against the short timetable.\n\n\"Unless you are prepared to contemplate more expansive debate, there is not the slightest possibility of considering the deal that has been obtained within the time available,\" Ken Clarke, a senior lawmaker recently ousted from Johnson's Conservative Party group in Parliament, told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nThe showdown comes just nine days before Britain's scheduled departure date. Johnson's government had sought a \"straight up-and-down vote\" Monday on the agreement he struck last week with the 27 other EU nations laying out the terms of Britain's exit.\n\nBut the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, refused to allow it because lawmakers voted to delay approving the Brexit deal on Saturday, and parliamentary rules bar the same measure from being considered a second time during a session of Parliament unless something has changed.\n\nBercow's ruling plunged the tortuous Brexit process back into grimly familiar territory: acrimonious uncertainty.\n\nJohnson's Conservatives hold just 288 of the 650 House of Commons seats, so he will need support from opposition and independent lawmakers to pass the bill \u2014 if, that is, Parliament approves the timetable on Tuesday.\n\nThe bill turns the deal Johnson struck with the EU into law. It sets out the terms of Britain's departure, including measures to maintain an open border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. It also enshrines the right of U.K. and EU citizens living in the other's territory to continue with their lives, and sets out the multi-billion pound (dollar) payments Britain must make to meet its financial obligations to the EU.\n\nIt also confirms a transition period lasting until at least the end of 2020 \u2014 and possibly 2022 \u2014 in which relations will remain frozen as they are now while a permanent new relationship is worked out.\n\nOpposition lawmakers plan to seek amendments that could substantially alter the bill, for example by adding a requirement that the Brexit deal be put to voters in a new referendum, or by requiring the government to extend the transition period until a new trade deal with the EU has been agreed.\n\nThe government says such major amendments would wreck its legislation and it will withdraw the bill if the opposition plan succeeds.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was headed for a showdown Tuesday with lawmakers who want to put the brakes on his drive to push his European Union divorce bill through the House of Commons in just three days and take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31.
