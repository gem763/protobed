You can tell from the main structure of his face that he must have been quite handsome as young man.\n\n\u2018What lowers his score somewhat is the softening of the jawline and around the neck and chin which is quite common in a man of his age, and also some slightly dropping of the eyelids above the eye, but all these things can be greatly improved with cosmetic surgery procedures.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Plastic surgeon wants more work shocker,\u2019 the presenter quipped.\n\nPiers was \u2018quite handsome as a young man\u2019, according to De Silva (Picture: ITV)\n\nSusanna was declared \u2018extremely beautiful\u2019 (Picture: ITV)\n\nHowever the doctor was full of praise for Susanna, calling her \u2018an extremely beautiful woman\u2019.\n\nDe Silva went on: \u2018Her nose is in wonderful proportion to her lips. In fact all of her mapping scores were in the 80s or above which shows a high degree of symmetry and it\u2019s clear she is an extremely beautiful woman.\u2019\n\nOf course Piers was grouchy about the feedback his co-presenter received, saying: \u2018Where are the negatives? No negatives. Absolutely ridiculous. I used to be alright once and now you\u2019re a fat lad. She gets, oh radiant, beautiful, wonderful.\u2019\n\nDe Silva was the man who declared model Bella Hadid the most beautiful woman in the world based on the \u2018golden ratio\u2019.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
