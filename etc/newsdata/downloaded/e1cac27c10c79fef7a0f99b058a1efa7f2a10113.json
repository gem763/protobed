He was then arrested in 2019 for a string of child sex offences.\n\nPowerful associations, including Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Prince Andrew, have had their conduct scrutinised in the wake of the ongoing scandal.\n\nMr Mandelson, who was friends with Epstein\u2019s former lover Ghislaine Maxwell, was staying on the island of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy when the pictures were taken.\n\n(AFP/Getty) More\n\nBut it is suggested the two may have met on other occasions.\n\nIn 2011, Virginia Roberts \u2013 who claims she was a sex slave to Epstein \u2013 said that she was introduced to Mr Mandelson at a dinner party at the financier\u2019s house in New York.\n\nShe said: \u201cI never heard of Jeffrey knowing Tony Blair, but he did know Peter Mandelson. I remember him being at the house in New York and I was introduced to him at a dinner party.\n\n\u201cHe and Jeffrey talked business together. I assumed they were in business together.
