Prosecutors dropped the charges.\n\nRobinson testified in 1999 that he had been coerced into saying Washington was the shooter when shown his mug shot, saying at the time that officers told him \u201cif I didn\u2019t cooperate, I would never see my mother again.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Robinson was walking to a corner store when he saw a group of men talking across the street before he heard the fatal shots.\n\nWhen police brought Robinson in for questioning, he told investigators he heard the gunshots and ran to his mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s home but did not know the group of men and did not see who fired the weapon, the lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cAfraid and removed from his mother, twelve-year-old Otis crumbled under the pressure,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cOtis agreed to the Defendants\u2019 lies, and when asked who the shooter was, Otis falsely identified [Washington] as the shooter, an identification the Officer Defendants knew to be false.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only evidence that linked [Washington] to the crime came from Otis Robinson,\u201d the lawsuit continued, pointing to the fact that prosecutors called only Robinson to the witness stand to testify.\n\nThe lawsuit says police also coerced a 13-year-old girl, named only as \u201cR.D.\u201d in the lawsuit, who was standing in the crowd near the shooting. The lawsuit said police threatened to take her away from and possibly arrest her mother if she did not cooperate.\n\nShe did not testify in the case but signed a witness statement identifying Washington as the shooter, the lawsuit said. He was convicted of first-degree murder and a weapons charge on July 20, 1987.\n\nWashington is suing the officers involved in the investigation, the Baltimore City Police Department, the mayor and city council for punitive and compensatory damages. None of the officers named appear to still be with the department as they are not named in a salary database for city employees for fiscal year 2018.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that although Washington obtained a GED while incarcerated and has found a job with a construction company since his release, he lost contact with close friends and family members over the years.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "A boy and girl were told they would not see mothers again if they did not identify Gary Washington as the shooter in a homicide, the suit said.", "authors": ["Baltimore Sun", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
