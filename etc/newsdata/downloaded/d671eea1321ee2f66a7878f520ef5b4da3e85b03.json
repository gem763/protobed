The Straits Times\n\nNot all credit cards were created equal, so it really matters if yours is the right one for your spending habits.\n\nA study of credit cards in Singapore has found that customer satisfaction levels vary widely across the major card issuers, with customers of American Express, DBS and POSB expressing the highest satisfaction.\n\nThe research, conducted by marketing insights firm J.D. Power, found that overall satisfaction with Singapore\u2019s eight major credit card issuers has fallen in 2019.\n\nBased on a 1,000-point scale, the 2019 Singapore Credit Card Satisfaction Study measured satisfaction in six factors: interaction, rewards, credit card terms, communications, benefits and services, and key moments.\n\nThis year, overall satisfaction level fell six points to 712.\n\nWith a score of 755, American Express was the only issuer to receive five \u201cpower circles\u201d, which indicates a rating of \u201camong the best\u201d on the ranking.\n\nBoth DBS and POSB were given four \u201cpower circles\u201d each, which translates to a rating that is \u201cbetter than most\u201d.\n\nAnd while Citibank, OCBC, UOB and Standard Chartered were all given three \u201cpower circles\u201d and a rating of \u201cabout average\u201d, the scores for UOB and Standard Chartered fell below the study\u2019s average of 712. Only one bank \u2013 HSBC \u2013 received two \u201cpower circles\u201d, which gives it a classification of \u201cthe rest\u201d.\n\nThe average score for the eight card issuers was 712. J.D. Power\n\nJ.D. Power said in a statement that the top-ranked brands in its study happened to also have the highest ratings for being customer-driven.\n\nPeople have many cards, but many spend only on one primary card\n\nOn average, Singapore cardholders have four credit cards, but 77 per cent of their total credit card spend is with their primary card, J.D. Power found.\n\nIn addition, 44 per cent of cardholders say they have used only their primary card in the past year, up from 27 per cent in 2018.\n\nRead also: 7 in 10 Singaporeans own at least 1 credit card \u2013 and most of them are card debt-free, study finds\n\nThis behaviour is even more pronounced among millennials, with close to half (48 per cent) saying that they have used only their primary card in the past year.\n\n\u201cIt is essential for cards to be the front of wallet, given this notable development,\u201d J.D. Power said.\n\nHigh forex rates discourage travellers from spending overseas\n\nThe study of 2,805 credit cardholders fielded in August and September also found that as many as 70 per cent of Singapore cardholders don\u2019t use their cards overseas because of high transaction fees and exchange rates charged by their card issuers.\n\nCoupled with the risk of fraud, Singapore cardholders still prefer to forgo higher overseas spend reward points to use cash when they travel. Around 50 per cent of total spend abroad is still done via cash, the study found.\n\nAnthony Chiam, a J.D. Power regional practice leader in Asia and Australia for global business intelligence, called this a \u201cmissed opportunity for credit card issuers to fully capture overseas spending\u201d, especially given Singaporeans\u2019 love for travel.\n\n\u201cIt should be a cause for concern, given the rapid availability of other payment choices in the market,\u201d Chiam said.\n\nMany benefits, but only a few are useful\n\nIn addition, the study found that despite the large variety of benefits credit cardholders have access to, most people utilise just a small portion of the benefits on offer.\n\nAccording to J.D. Power, 89 per cent of cardholders are aware of these benefits, but 72 per cent of cardholders use just three or fewer of the benefits offered.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say that credit card benefits are unappreciated \u2013 more than half (64 per cent) have used discounts or special privileges offered by their card issuers\u2019 strategic partners.\n\n\u201cGiven that benefits are critical to customer acquisition and engagement, issuers must make sure they remain relevant by keeping up with the changing preferences of cardholders,\u201d the firm said.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Most Singapore credit cardholders still prefer to spend in cash when they travel - despite the higher rewards points offered..
