His arraignment was scheduled for later Tuesday.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it began investigating the 28-year-old Vazquez in August after learning of an alleged sexual relationship between Vazquez and a teenage girl living in Lee County, Florida. Vazquez, who lives in Saint Cloud, Florida, and the victim began the relationship when the girl was 13, authorities said.\n\nThe girl, now 15, allegedly received a text message from Vazquez in July in which he was performing a sex act. Vazquez also texted the girl to ask if she wanted to meet for a sexual encounter following the end of the baseball season, according to police.\n\nAuthorities arrested Vazquez and took him to the Allegheny County jail after executing a search warrant Tuesday morning at his Pittsburgh apartment. Police said they seized electronic devices that will be used in the investigation. Vazquez will be extradited to Florida.\n\n'We take this matter extremely seriously'\n\nVazquez, a two-time All-Star pitcher from Venezuela, is 5-1 with a 1.65 ERA and 28 saves for the Pirates this season. Pittsburgh is scheduled to play at home against Seattle on Tuesday night.\n\n\"We take this matter, and these charges in particular, extremely seriously,\" Pirates president Frank Coonelly said in a statement.\n\nThe MLB commissioner's office placed Vazquez on administrative leave as part of its policy regarding domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse.\n\nAdministrative leave is not considered discipline. Vazquez goes on the restricted list and continues to receive his salary but is ineligible to play.\n\nThe arrest is the latest setback in a turbulent season for the franchise. Vazquez and reliever Kyle Crick were both suspended a game last week after getting into a physical altercation in San Francisco. Crick injured the index finger of his right (pitching) hand during the altercation and underwent season-ending surgery. Crick maintained Vazquez threw the first punch, with general manager Neal Huntington condemning both players for their actions.\n\nVazquez signed a four-year, $22-million US contract with Pittsburgh before the 2018 season, with the team holding club options for 2022 and 2023.", "description": "Pittsburgh Pirates all-star closer Felipe Vazquez has been arrested on charges of pornography and soliciting a child.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5286989.1568743096!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/vazquez-felipe-091719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
