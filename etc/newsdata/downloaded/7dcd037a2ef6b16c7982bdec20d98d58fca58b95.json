I know they won the Europa League final, should have beaten Man City in the Carabao Cup final, and they came third in the Premier League, but the football wasn\u2019t great.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Now, the football is fantastic and everybody is joining in. Last season, you gave the ball to Eden Hazard, hope he did something and if he had an off day, Chelsea had no chance. Now, everybody is chipping in and they\u2019re all kids, enthusiastic and putting in performances.\u2019\n\nChristian Pulisic was Chelsea\u2019s star at Turf Moor as he netted a hat-trick on his first Premier League start since August and his performance is symbolic of Chelsea\u2019s season so far with a number of young players catching the eye.\n\nAcademy graduates Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Callum Hudson-Odoi have all emerged as integral members of Lampard\u2019s first-team squad and Merson thinks another manager might not have utilised their talents.\n\nHe added: \u2018The future is bright for Chelsea, although they have fallen over it. It was put on them and I don\u2019t know that without the transfer embargo or Frank Lampard, how many of them would be in the team. I think half of this team that are ripping it up now would be out on loan in the Championship.\n\n\u2018And you\u2019ve got to give Frank credit. He could have easily played safe and looked after himself, a lot of managers do and he could have gone with the experience, but he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s thought of the club more than himself and it\u2019s paid dividends.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Paul Merson has praised Frank Lampard for transforming Chelsea into one of the best footballing sides in the Premier League this season while aiming a dig at his predecessor Maurizio...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-11836084461_1572356936.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
