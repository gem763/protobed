Voters elected a president last year, Jair Bolsonaro, who is best known for populist rhetoric, but he also expresses support for market-friendly reforms.\n\nAnd even though he\u2019s sometimes referred to as the \u201cBrazilian Trump,\u201d President Bolsonaro seems to have a much better understanding of trade than his American counterpart.\n\nAt least if this report from the Wall Street Journal is any indication.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro \u2019s administration is opening up one of the world\u2019s most closed big economies, slashing import tariffs on more than 2,300 products and exposing local industries long accustomed to protectionism to the challenges of free trade. With little fanfare, the conservative government has since taking office in January eased the entry of ultrasonic scalpels, cancer drugs, heavy machinery and more, in some cases with tariffs reduced to zero from as much as 20%. The tariff cuts\u2026reflect a significant shift in the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, where duties were twice as high as in Mexico, China and the European Union last year. The new opening is a central feature in Economy Minister Paulo Guedes \u2019s plans to make the country of 210 million more competitive, part of an effort to rekindle a moribund economy historically shielded from foreign competition and bogged down by bureaucracy. \u2026\u201cBrazil\u2019s model of protectionism has failed,\u201d Deputy Economy Minister for Trade Marcos Troyjo, one of Brazil\u2019s chief trade negotiators, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s been 40 years without sustainable economic growth.\u201d\n\nHere are some excerpts about how Brazil has been hurt by trade barriers.\n\nThe problems created by protectionism are evident throughout Brazil\u2019s economy. When Mau\u00e1 University outside S\u00e3o Paulo imported American equipment last year that it couldn\u2019t find in Brazil to upgrade its physics lab, for example, import tariffs doubled the price tag to $70,000, said Francisco Olivieri, a business professor and head of Mau\u00e1\u2019s technology department. \u2026Protectionism hurts businesses that need to import supplies or parts and face high tariffs and bureaucracy to do so, which pushes them away from global supply chains. Red tape related to tariffs at Brazilian ports mean imported supplies can take weeks to reach buyers, causing production delays. Fifty-five percent of foreign products require the importing companies to obtain permits from as many as six different government agencies, according to a recent study by the National Confederation of Industry, or CNI, a trade group that represents Brazilian factories. Importers are subject to steep fines if they fail to request a permit, but it is often difficult to determine from which agencies they must seek approval.\n\nIn other words, Brazilian companies are hit by a double-whammy of trade barriers and red tape.\n\nThis is why liberalization is so important.\n\nIncidentally, the EFW data only captures what happened up through 2017.\n\nAnd since Brazil (#87) isn\u2019t that far behind the United States (#55) in the trade rankings, I won\u2019t be overly surprised in a few years if Brazil jumps the United States given the combination of Bolsonaro\u2019s good policies and Trump\u2019s bad policies.\n\nP.S. Brazil is also in the process of curtailing pensions and already has adopted a constitutional spending cap.\n\nP.P.S. President Bolsonaro is quite good on gun rights.\n\nP.P.P.S. A few years ago, I fretted Brazil has passed a tipping point of dependency. I\u2019m somewhat hopeful that assessment was too pessimistic.", "description": "According to the\u00a0most-recent edition of\u00a0Economic Freedom of the World, Brazil .09/25/2019 19:26:16PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
