And although Mueller's team emphasized that its report \"does not exonerate\" the president, prosecutors did not bring criminal charges against Trump.\n\nIn his April phone call to Trump, Barr is said to have asked the president why Giuliani was attacking McGahn ohn TV and drawing attention to himself instead of declaring victory in the Mueller probe and calling for the country to move on, The Journal reported.\n\nBarr's interest in the matter is highly unusual, given that he is the nation's chief law enforcement officer and is tasked with guarding the institution of the presidency and not the reputation of the president himself.\n\nBut this isn't the first time Barr has been perceived as functioning more as the president's personal lawyer than as the attorney general.\n\nRead more: 'Pure insanity': Intelligence veterans are floored by Barr's 'off the books' overtures to foreign officials about the Russia probe\n\nLate Monday, the Washington Post reported that Barr traveled overseas and personally asked top foreign intelligence officials to help with a Justice Department inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation, led by US attorney John Durham.\n\n\"This is unheard of,\" one former senior Justice Department official who worked closely with the former special counsel Robert Mueller when he was FBI director, told Insider.\n\nRobert Deitz, a former top lawyer at the CIA and the National Security Agency, also said he hadn't heard \"of so much involvement by the attorney general in this sort of investigation.\"\n\n\"This is work for the gumshoes,\" he told Insider. Barr's involvement is all the more unusual, Deitz added, given Durham's reputation. \"I have worked with John Durham. He is absolutely a straight shooter. What he says one can rely on.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, The New York Times reported that Barr personally asked Trump to call Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and ask that he assist with the Justice Department's inquiry. The Associated Press reported that the call was one of a \"number of times\" Trump made similar calls at Barr's behest.\n\nTo date, there is no evidence that the DOJ or the FBI acted improperly while investigating the Trump campaign, and the call to \"investigate the investigators\" is widely perceived to be part of an effort to undermine the Russia probe and fuel Trump's baseless conspiracy theories of a \"deep state\" plot to oust him from office.\n\nAnd in a July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to work with Barr and Giuliani to help discredit the Russia investigation as well as to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe call is at the center of an explosive whistleblower complaint that a US intelligence official filed against Trump. It mentioned Giuliani 31 times and described him as a \"central figure\" in Trump's efforts. It added that Barr \"appears to be involved as well.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday accused Barr of being part of a \"cover-up of the cover-up\" and \"going rogue\" in relation to the Justice Department's role in urging the acting director of national intelligence against releasing the whistleblower complaint to Congress. The extent of Barr's involvement is an open question, but there's no evidence he played a direct role.", "description": "William Barr has been widely accused of behaving more like Trump's personal lawyer than the attorney general.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth", "John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93a4032e22af65560c0547?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
