REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nThe union has put forward a new proposal in a letter to British Airways Chief Executive Officer Alex Cruz in an effort to reach a deal with the company, BALPA said in a statement.\n\nBALPA said last month that the pilots would go on strike for three days in September in a dispute over pay that could disrupt the peak summer holiday season.\n\nThe strikes could still go ahead if the airline continues to refuse meaningful discussions, the union added.\n\nBritish Airways said it would meet BALPA.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be available for constructive talks, on the basis that there are no pre-conditions to those talks,\u201d the airline said in a statement.\n\nThe pilots overwhelmingly voted for industrial action in July and the airline, which is part of IAG, failed in a court bid to stop them.\n\nBALPA has said that British Airways should share more of its profits with its pilots. The union has also given notice to the airline that it will call on its members to strike on Sept. 27.\n\n\u201cOur members\u2019 resolve is very strong and they remain very angry with BA, but they also want to leave no stone unturned in trying to find a resolution to their dispute,\u201d BALPA General Secretary, Brian Strutton, said.\n\n\u201cAvoiding strike action and agreeing a deal with their pilots surely must be the desired outcome for British Airways,\u201d he added.\n\nBritish Airways has said the strike action was unjustifiable as its pay offer was fair and that the strikes would destroy the travel plans of tens of thousands of customers.\n\nThe airline said in August it was exploring options to supplement its fleet with aircraft and crew from other airlines, a practice known as wet-leasing, and working with partner airlines to schedule larger aircraft to take more customers.\n\nRyanair members of BALPA have also announced a further seven days of strikes as their latest walkout comes to an end.\n\nWhile widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, the first series of strikes since then in Britain, Spain and Portugal has caused minimal disruption.\n\nIAG\u2019s shares were 0.5% higher at 426.3 pence at 0836 GMT.", "description": "British Airways pilots could call off proposed strikes set for Sept. 9 and 10 if the airline agrees to come back to the negotiating table, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Noor Zainab Hussain", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426484083&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840TO", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
