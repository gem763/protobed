Still, nearly six in 10 respondents said they\u2019re worried about their parents aging and another 58% said the cost of care, in terms of a caregiver, is a major concern. \u201cSaving for parents old age is extremely challenging since most people have enough trouble handling their own retirement savings and health care concerns plus requirements from their children,\u201d said Rand Spero, president of Street Smart Financial in Lexington, Mass. \u201cOne might ask, how many generations can we support?\u201d\n\nSee: Here\u2019s a more realistic way to look at health care costs in retirement\n\nHealth care in retirement is a major expense, and it only gets more expensive as a person ages. A 65-year-old couple retiring in 2019 can expect to spend $285,000, out of pocket, for health care in retirement, according to Fidelity Investments, but that figure does not include long-term care, such as having an in-home aide or going to a skilled nursing facility.\n\nMany American adults today are in the middle of two generations that may rely on them. Someone in their 40s or 50s could still be assisting children through college or the first few years of adulthood, while simultaneously caring for elderly parents, financially, emotionally or physically, if they live nearby. Generation X is currently the generation caught in the middle \u2014 known as the \u201csandwich\u201d generation \u2014 but they also need to focus on their own retirements, or they risk having too little stashed away for their own futures.\n\nFamily members should be open about their expectations for care and financial assistance in old age, said Howard Pressman, partner at EBW Financial Planning in Vienna, Va. \u201cIncreasingly, the success of one\u2019s financial plan is dependent on family members being financially prepared as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a relative needs money, this could put tremendous pressure on my client\u2019s plan and in extreme cases, blow it up.\u201d\n\nRead: Fewer than 1 in 4 young adults are \u2018financially independent\u2019 from their parents\n\nThere is no universal solution for any one person\u2019s care in old age, nor how families may pay for or arrange that care, said Adam Blackman, chief executive officer and founder of Mavencare. \u201cIt is about starting the conversation early,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these things take time and you need to be informed about solutions and really understand what is important for the family and loved ones.\u201d Being proactive is better than reactive, he added, noting a medical event or emergency shouldn\u2019t be the time to start these conversations.\n\nHaving to pay for both one\u2019s current expenses as well as a loved one\u2019s medical expenses can be stressful, but many Americans in past surveys say they would do that, as well as provide physical care, no matter what. A strong majority \u2014 92% \u2014 of people in a Merrill Lynch and Age Wave report of 2,000 people said they financially assist their parents, such as paying the bills and handling insurance claims.\n\nAlso see: Not expecting to be a caregiver? You better check that with your parents\n\nFamily members may also want to meet with an elder care attorney, who can review current assets as well as strategies to maintain that money or use it appropriately for future health care costs, said Ian Weinberg, chief executive officer of Family Wealth & Pension Management in Woodbury, N.Y. If parents do have money to spend in retirement, Medicaid could disqualify them or the program could drain all they have. \u201cThis is the chicken and egg conundrum,\u201d he said. \u201cProtect the assets now (think shifting assets to an irrevocable trust), get parents Medicaid-eligible, let their health be covered \u2014 or consider going out of pocket for the biggest expense their parents (and they) will ever have.\u201d Some clients have purchased long-term care insurance policies for their parents or in-laws, said Mike Alves, managing director and founder of Vida Private Wealth in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nSome people may want to mix informal care, such as from a family, with a professional, or they may review housing opportunities and plan to downsize over time. Family members and other loved ones should discuss living arrangements \u2014 especially if nobody is in close by \u2014 as well as analyze the finances, listen to the patient\u2019s wishes for long-term care and strategize medical events, day-to-day care and insurance claims. \u201cFamilies will have a much greater success of coming up with the solution that best meets everyone\u2019s needs.\u201d", "description": "Most Americans don\u2019t, but they probably should.", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT854_parent_ZG_20191023105157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
