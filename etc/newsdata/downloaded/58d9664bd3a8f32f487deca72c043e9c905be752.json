It would only have been denied if all WTO members present voted against. The meeting lasted less than 20 minutes.\n\nU.S. trade ambassador Dennis Shea told the meeting that Washington still preferred a negotiated solution.\n\n\"But that can only happen if the EU genuinely terminates the benefits to Airbus from current subsidies and ensures that subsidies to Airbus cannot be revived under another name or another mechanism,\" he told the meeting.\n\nThe EU delegation told the meeting that it had \"serious concerns\" and that U.S. tariff measures were short-sighted.\n\nThe WTO has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (N: ) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. An adjudication in the Boeing case is expected early in 2020.\n\nThe United States has said it will impose 10% tariffs on Airbus planes and 25% duties on a range of products, including French wine, Scottish whiskies and cheese from across the continent.\n\nOn Friday, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer urging him to start negotiations to find a settlement of the Airbus and Boeing cases, adding that resorting to tariffs was not a solution.\n\n\"It would only inflict damage on businesses and put at risk jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time,\" she wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.", "description": "WTO clears U.S. to target EU goods with tariffs over Airbus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9D0OV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
