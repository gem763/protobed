Here's Why", "language": "en", "text": "In a world where Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is killing its competitors, it\u2019s tough to find another consumer company which has so consistently exceeded expectations. The sportswear giant, Nike (NYSE: ) is certainly one of them.\n\nThe company said on Tuesday it earned $0.86 a share in its that ended last month, crushing analysts\u2019 estimates. These quarterly earnings per share topped even the most bullish Wall Street estimate by $0.13 cents. Sales rose 7% from a year earlier and expanded 10% after adjusting for currency swings.\n\nNike has topped quarterly earnings estimates more than 90% of the time over the past 11 years during a period when online disruptors, such as Amazon, gained a major share of consumer spending.\n\nAt the forefront of this great upside is the company\u2019s \u201cTriple Double Strategy,\u201d which means doubling its resources on its digital properties, accelerating innovation and product creation, and deepening one-to-one connections.\n\nMany executives use similar language when they communicate with shareholders, but when it comes to Nike, there is visible solid progress on the ground to back it up. The Nike brand has become a powerful, statement name, whose sports shoes and clothing ranges are now worn everywhere, and not just in the gym, or on the soccer field.\n\nNike Is Winning Everywhere\n\nThe result of these efforts is that Nike is grabbing a greater market share from its main European rival, Adidas AG (DE: ), even in its home market, while outperforming in the major growth markets of Asia.\n\nIn the latest report, Nike\u2019s sales in China, for example, surged 27%, excluding currency effects, despite the escalating trade war that, technically, should hit American brands in the communist nation hard.\n\nOne major area where Nike has excelled is in its online strategy, which is helping to cut costs, boost sales and expand its margins. Nike\u2019s digital sales rose 42% from a year earlier in its first quarter, after they rose 35% growth in the last fiscal year. In Q1, they expanded across all regions with North America posting a 30% gain, Europe, the Middle East and Africa a double digit increase, Asia Pacific and Latin America rising 50% and China jumping over 70%.\n\nNike maintained its year revenue growth target of high-single digits, but boosted its gross margin expansion forecast to 50-75 basis points. It had been projecting a 50-basis point increase.\n\nNike price chart\n\nSuch a strong report was enough to send Nike shares soaring. Its stock rose 4.16% yesterday to close at $90.81, having touched a new record of $92.79 during the day. After yesterday\u2019s gains, the shares are up about 24% this year, continuing the spectacular ascent that has doubled their value during the past five years.\n\nFollowing this powerful rally, Nike valuations look quite rich with its stock trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 35. That means a company which makes shoes and t-shirts will have to grow faster than Facebook (NASDAQ: ), or Apple (NASDAQ: ) to justify these valuations. The majority of analysts, however, don\u2019t believe it will be a problem for Nike to pull that off.\n\n\n\nSusquehanna analyst, Sam Poser, said:\n\n\u201cCompelling initiatives and strategic investments, particularly in digital, reinforce Nike\u2019s evolution and should lead to sustainable high-single digit FX-neutral growth and margin expansion.\"\n\nBottom Line\n\nNike is a solid dividend-paying stock, offering a quarterly payout of $0.22 and a yield of 1.01%, that could be stashed in any long-term portfolio in order to benefit from the company\u2019s strong growth momentum and expanding income stream. The strength in the company\u2019s gross margin is especially encouraging. It shows the underlying soundness of Nike\u2019s strategic initiatives which are transforming the sportswear giant into a high margin business.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Adidas AG, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Nike Inc.
