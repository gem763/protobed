(Getty Images)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 It\u2019s still nearly three hours before tipoff of Tuesday night\u2019s season opener between the Lakers and Clippers, and the man in the black surgical mask and backward baseball cap is starting to get antsy.\n\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asks a fellow volunteer.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nUpon receiving a nod, he grabs a bagful of yellow and black \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts from the back of a rental truck and walks toward Staples Center in hopes of finding like-minded fans willing to display that message inside the arena.\n\nThe man known by the pseudonym \u201cMWG\u201d is one of three activists responsible for organizing the largest-scale protest yet of the NBA\u2019s handling of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s infamous tweet. It\u2019s been nearly three weeks since Morey\u2019s tweet supporting Hong Kong sent NBA luminaries scrambling to appease China, giving the appearance they care more about protecting their financial interests than defending Morey\u2019s right to free speech.\n\nIn the wake of China\u2019s outrage over Morey\u2019s tweet, a Reddit user who goes by the pseudonym of \u201cSun Lared\u201d posted, \u201cLet\u2019s pass out \u2018Free Hong Kong\u2019 T-shirts at Staples Center on Opening Night and make Chinese TV censor the whole audience.\u201d Much to the Northern California resident\u2019s surprise, the GoFundMe page he created to fund his cause raked in $43,000 within 48 hours.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe we could raise enough money to buy a few thousand shirts, but I was blown away by how much support we got,\u201d Lared said. \u201cI think it says a lot about how strongly people feel that American companies shouldn\u2019t self censor themselves on China\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOverwhelmed by the notion of organizing a demonstration this massive on his own, Lared gladly accepted help from a pair of fellow Reddit users sympathetic to the cause. Los Angeles-area residents \u201cMWG\u201d and \u201cKarpov\u201d helped Lared design and print 13,000 T-shirts, rent a truck to get them to Staples Center and find dozens of fellow volunteers willing to help distribute them.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the three men met for the first time in a parking lot across the street from Staples Center. None of the trio revealed their real names to anyone out of fear of harassment on social media or the Chinese government tormenting their friends or family in Hong Kong.\n\nLared and Karpov set a conservative goal of at least 1,000 fans wearing the \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d shirts inside the arena, enough to make their presence known and bring attention to their cause. MWG had bigger objectives in mind, which is why he spent time earlier in the week scouting the walkways outside Staples Center to identify where the most foot traffic would be.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, MCW zipped around the outskirts of the arena, offering encouragement to the volunteers passing out shirts and advising them where to go next. He brought water bottles when the volunteers got thirsty, pamphlets when they ran low or bags of shirts when they were out of a certain size.\n\n\u201cI lived in Hong Kong from 1999-2000 and I loved it,\u201d a man told him after accepting a shirt. \u201cI hope it stays the same.\u201d\n\nReplied MWG, \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nOrganizers brought 13,000 pro-Hong Kong T-shirts to Staples Center to pass out prior to the Lakers-Clippers game. (Jeff Eisenberg/Yahoo Sports)\n\nChina vs. the NBA\n\nThe confrontation between the NBA and China erupted on Oct. 4. China took offense to Morey\u2019s tweet and countered by attempting to use its economic clout to muzzle not only Morey but any other outspoken NBA luminaries tempted to speak up on Hong Kong\u2019s behalf. Broadcasts of Rockets games were scrapped and sponsorship deals were halted.\n\nScrambling to protect the hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, the NBA released a statement calling Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cregrettable.\u201d James Harden apologized, the owner of the Houston Rockets publicly rebuked Morey and LeBron James said Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation\u201d\n\nIn the wake of those comments, several hundred protesters wearing black \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts attended the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 final preseason game on Friday at the Barclays Center. One fan\u2019s homemade sign targeted LeBron. Another read, \u201cDon\u2019t let China buy our silence. People are dying to be free.\u201d\n\nAmong those in attendance that night was Nathan Law, a Yale grad student and former Hong Kong lawmaker who says he was imprisoned for several months in 2017 for his role in pro-democracy protests. According to Law\u2019s Twitter account, the protesters targeted the Nets to \u201csend a signal\u201d to the team\u2019s owner Joseph Tsai, co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, that \u201cthe way he followed the CCP\u2019s stigmatization and criticized Morey was disgraceful.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement organized larger-scale protests for the opening week of the NBA regular season, the first of which took place Tuesday night in Toronto before the reigning champion Raptors opened their title defense against the Pelicans. Mimi Lee, a financial adviser who founded the Torontonian HongKongers Action Group, raised enough money to purchase and distribute 7,000 yellow and black T-shirts that read, \u201cThe North stands with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to make enough noise to show the world what is happening and raise awareness,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI grew up in Hong Kong and I went back to Hong Kong to work for nearly a decade after I graduated, and it\u2019s heartbreaking to see how much things have changed. The majority of our rights have eroded and the Chinese are influencing more and more.\u201d\n\nA similar demonstration is scheduled to take place Thursday in San Francisco when the Golden State Warriors open their new arena. San Francisco resident Lee Bishop raised more than $13,000 via GoFundMe, purchased thousands of blue-and-yellow \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d shirts and found more than 80 volunteers to help him pass them out.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s extremely hypocritical that the NBA and its players are turning a blind eye to human rights violations,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cI just hope that everyone who is going to the game will embrace the message and stand up for what\u2019s right. It will be great to let this broadcast go across the globe and let the world see that America stands with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t put a price on freedom\u2019\n\nIn Los Angeles, the organizers of the Staples Center protest had a lot to smile about as they observed their teams of volunteers handing out shirts. Though some Lakers and Clippers fans were too excited about the upcoming season not to display team colors or too fashion-conscious to don a free T-shirt, many others embraced the cause and slipped the pro-Hong Kong shirts over whatever they were wearing.\n\nA hostess at a restaurant adjacent to Staples Center snuck away from her post long enough to grab T-shirts for herself and three colleagues. Moments later, a man in a faded Nick Van Exel jersey asked for an extra large. Up next was a dad who took a shirt for himself and his son and explained, \u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on freedom.\u201d\n\nFor the three organizers of the protest, the sight of people wearing the Hong Kong shirts was satisfying for different reasons. They wanted to show the people of Hong Kong that Americans have their back. They wanted to show China that Americans cannot be silenced. And they wanted to show NBA players and owners that there are consequences to putting Chinese dollars above American values.\n\n\u201cI think this particular protest has a lot more to do with freedom of speech in the U.S. than anything to do with Hong Kong,\u201d Karpov said. \u201cThis is our turf in the U.S. This is our people exercising their most fundamental right of freedom of speech. I don\u2019t know how it happened that a country that has a business relationship with us can now determine what we say.\u201d\n\nEach time Karpov, MWG and Lared returned to the rental truck throughout the evening, the pile of T-shirts outside kept getting smaller and smaller. At 6 p.m. Tuesday night, the protesters had distributed roughly half the 13,000 shirts they ordered. By tipoff, not many boxes of T-shirts remained.\n\nThere was far more Clippers red and blue or Lakers purple and gold in Staples Center than there were fans clad in \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d shirts, but enough people wore them for the organizers of the protest to be satisfied. One kid even tricked the Staples Center video board operators into showing his \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d shirt on the dance cam.\n\nthe best clip to start the NBA season is this kid baiting the broadcast into flashing a \"Fight for freedom stand with Hong Kong\" sign on TV and then the cameraman pans away pic.twitter.com/B30ubY63CX \u2014 Rod Breslau (@Slasher) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cEven if they don\u2019t all wear them at the game and they wear them at the mall or the park, that\u2019s spreading awareness,\u201d Karpov said. \u201cHopefully the impact will be felt days and weeks after.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The NBA season kicked off Tuesday night with Lakers vs. Clippers ... and activists passing out 'Stand with Hong Kong' T-shirts outside Staples Center.", "authors": ["Jeff Eisenberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dtYOZuyQY3qnUOItkEkTng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTMuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QPeNGbUacKofOyvC.btWzg--~B/aD0yOTc0O3c9NDgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8145e640-f563-11e9-bfeb-739bb79cfdf5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
