United, meanwhile, have won just two of their eight league fixtures this term.\n\nFrench World Cup-winner Pogba is out with a foot injury (Picture: Getty)\n\nAsked about United\u2019s injury crisis, Van Dijk told Sky Sports: \u2018For them, it is not the ideal situation to lose your first-choice goalkeeper, one of the best in the world, and one of their main midfielders.\n\n\u2018They will be disappointed but for us, we just want to focus on ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They want to bounce back for all they\u2019ve done this season and it\u2019s not what they\u2019ve wanted so far, but we want to go out there and extend our points tally and keep winning.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re not in the best way, they\u2019re not fully confident and they\u2019re not in the situation they want to be in. But the good thing about football is you can bounce back in any game.\n\n\u2018They might think this is the best occasion to bounce back from it but we know that. We want to go out and fight for every metre on the pitch and try and take the three points back to Liverpool.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s massive, but it\u2019s more massive for the fans. I think all of the Champions League games are as big as this.\n\nDe Gea injured himself during the international break (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018The whole atmosphere and leading to the actual game is bigger than some other games but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the biggest of the season.\n\n\u2018The big ones are the Champions League and the ones that are hopefully going to win us the Premier League title.\u2019\n\nVan Dijk has been one of the most impressive players in the Premier League since completing a \u00a375million move to Liverpool in January 2018.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe Netherlands international has started 60 of the 61 games he has played for Liverpool and said: \u2018I want to be involved in every game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They\u2019re the most fun part of being a football player anyway, to go out there and show your talents to the world, try to win a game with a team you train with day in, day out.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not easy, you need to look after yourself and with the life we live, it\u2019s very important to leave a lot of things.\n\nVan Dijk is one of Liverpool\u2019s most important players (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018For example, we play four games in the next 11 days, you\u2019re travelling and staying in hotels and you need to watch what you eat, drink and make sure you recover well.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not complaining, not at all, but you need to look after yourself because at the end of the day, the people are coming to the stadium to watch you play and it doesn\u2019t matter if you had a cold the day before, they want you to turn up on matchday.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why it\u2019s very important to look after yourself and a big part of that is staying fit. Luckily, so far, I\u2019ve been doing that pretty well and hopefully I can keep doing it.\u2019\n\nThe PFA Players\u2019 Player of the Year and UEFA Men\u2019s Player of the Year added: \u2018My role is the same with or without the armband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I try to take responsibility because in my position, I have to and I want to as well.\n\n\u2018I tried to lead the boys from behind and most of the time, I have an overview of the whole pitch so I can try to shout to the front three, whether they hear it or not.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Around me as well with the goalie, the full-backs, or the midfielders, I try to shout at them, whether it is nonsense or things that are necessary and need to be said.\n\n\u2018I think it is a very important thing in football to keep each other awake and alert. Sometimes they have to shout it to me as well and they will.\u2019\n\nAhead of the weekend, Liverpool have been boosted by the news Joel Matip will be fit to face Manchester United.\n\nMORE: Manchester City planning contract talks with Raheem Sterling", "description": "Virgil van Dijk admits it is 'not ideal' for Manchester United to lose Paul Pogba and David de Gea for their much-anticipated clash against Liverpool.
