Storyful\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 A tropical disturbance over Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula was being eyed Tuesday by New Orleans authorities, who fear it could become a tropical depression or storm that would topple a partially collapsed building and two huge construction cranes onto neighboring buildings at the edge of the city\u2019s historic French Quarter.\n\nIt was the latest grim news delivered near the site where two people died Saturday morning as the upper floors of a hotel under construction came tumbling down in a cloud of blinding dust. One body remained in the rubble Tuesday evening and hopes that a missing worker will be found alive in the wreckage were dimming after four days of risky searches.\n\nFire Chief Tim McConnell said searchers using dogs and high-tech equipment were able to get a partial view of the body known to be in the building but were unable to reach it or find the missing worker. Searchers found an unidentifiable fluid in the area that they collected. It will be tested to determine if it was from a human body and whether it could be used to identify either victim.\n\nWitnessdescribes 'mind boggling' Hard Rock hotel construction collapse\n\nHard Rock Hotel collapse: Engineer: 'Logically, it doesn't make sense'\n\nThis aerial photo shows the Hard Rock Hotel, which was under construction, after a fatal partial collapse in New Orleans, Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019.

An idea to try to attach one of the cranes back to the building to try to stabilize it also was rejected. \u201cThey were against moving it in any way, shape or form and didn\u2019t believe it was safe enough to even work around it,\u201d he said.\n\nMcConnell, accompanied by New Orleans Homeland Security Director Collin Arnold, Mayor LaToya Cantrell and other city officials, said authorities are satisfied that a blocks-long evacuation area around the damaged structures is sufficient, if obeyed, to keep anyone else from being harmed if the structures fall.\n\nBut, if no way is found to stabilize the building and cranes, neighboring buildings and infrastructure at the intersection of usually busy Canal and Rampart streets are in danger of disastrous damage.\n\nAny wind and rain is a concern, officials said, saying wind could sway the cranes and rain could loosen dangling debris.\n\n\u201cThis could become a tropical depression, maybe a tropical storm,\u201d Arnold said of the disturbance over the Yucatan, which forecasters gave a 40% chance of development somewhere over the Gulf.\n\n\u201cWith that you could expect south, southwest winds on this track, 20, 30, 35 miles an hour and the rain that would accompany that,\u201d Arnold said.\n\nExperts from around the world were called in to help, including crane manufacturers and engineers and the Thornton Tomasetti engineering and consulting firm that aided in the cleanup and recovery at Ground Zero after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe prolonged danger of further collapse means the indefinite closure of two major thoroughfares \u2014 Canal Street and the intersecting Rampart Street \u2014 along with streetcar lines and bus routes adjacent to the French Quarter and business district.\n\nThe 18-story Hard Rock Hotel was expected to be a major boost to the revitalization efforts for Canal Street in New Orleans.

A popular new restaurant had opened on the block in recent years. And fire-ravaged buildings across the street are being redeveloped into retail and residential projects.\n\nThe 18-story Hard Rock Hotel was expected to be a major boost to that revitalization.\n\nNow, because of the danger of further collapse, commerce around the site has come crashing to a halt of uncertain duration.\n\nAmong the businesses in the danger zone was the Saenger Theatre on Canal, a 1927 movie and live performance palace restored to its flapper-era glory in 2013, eight years after it was badly flooded because of levee failures during Hurricane Katrina. Touring versions of Broadway hits have been a success at the Saenger but performances of \u201cWicked\u201d that were supposed to run through this week were canceled and the future of other productions is unclear.\n\nAlso closed was the tony New Orleans Athletic Club, which was constructed on Rampart in the 1920s and boasted a celebrity guest list that over the years has included Tennessee Williams, Johnny Weismuller and Govs. Huey and Earl Long. The facility emailed members that it had arranged for other fitness centers to accommodate their workouts during the closure.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2019/10/16/new-orleans-hotel-collapse-tropical-weather-could-bring-new-dangers/3996615002/", "description": "Wind and rain at the site of a News Orleans hotel collapse is a concern as wind could sway cranes and rain could loosen dangling debris.", "authors": ["Kevin Mcgill", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
