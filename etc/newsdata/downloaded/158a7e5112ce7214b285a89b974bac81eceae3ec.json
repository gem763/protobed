Business Insider Intelligence\n\nSurescripts CEO Tom Skelton acknowledged in an email to customers that an internal investigation into ReMy's practices turned up a \"very small\" amount of questionable activity. Nevertheless, Skelton said Surescripts is severing ties with ReMy to maintain the \"integrity of its network.\"\n\nThis is a huge blow to PillPack and will significantly limit the online pharmacy's ability to verify users' prescription information. The company will no longer be able to automatically verify patient prescription information \u2014 it will instead need to contact each user to verify their medications and dosages. And collecting that information from users could be difficult for PillPack considering its customers are juggling multiple prescriptions: PillPack users take seven medications a day on average.\n\nThis is the latest twist in an ongoing legal saga heating up between Surescripts and PillPack \u2014 and other healthcare incumbents trying to stave off Amazon's healthcare play.\n\nApril to June 2019: Courts bar former CVS exec from taking a position at PillPack. CVS filed a lawsuit against a former exec at its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) arm CVS Caremark to prevent the individual from taking up a post at PillPack. The courts eventually ruled in favor of CVS, blocking the employee from working at PillPack for 18 months. It's worth noting that CVS is a partial owner of Surescripts, and CVS has execs on Surescripts' board. Additionally, court documents from the case revealed that PillPack is interested in selling prescription drugs directly to health plans and employers, which would put it in competition not just with retail pharmacies, but also with companies operating in the $423 billion PBM market, which CVS Caremark held an impressive 30% share of in 2018.\n\nJuly 2019: Surescripts threatens to deny PillPack access to prescription information. PillPack was informed in early July that it would be losing access to Surescripts' troves of prescription information, sources told CNBC. Surescripts manages 80% of all US prescriptions, data that is critical for PillPack to be able to inform customers of health and safety risks, avoid duplicate scripts, and stay on top of refills. It makes sense then why Amazon was reportedly considering suing Surescripts when news of the potential data shutout first surfaced, given there aren't really other options for where PillPack can get the prescription data it needs to serve its customers.\n\nJuly 2019: Surescripts announced it would be turning its investigation into ReMy Health's allegedly fraudulent behavior over to the FBI. Surescripts alleges that ReMy gained access to prescription data under false pretenses, claiming the information was going to hospital providers when it was, in fact, being sent to PillPack. For its part, PillPack said that all requests for patient medical information were made with complete user consent.\n\nHere's what's likely to happen next in the Surescripts-PillPack dispute and what it might mean for Amazon's healthcare play:\n\nAmazon will likely make good on its reported threats of legal action and sue Surescripts in an attempt to restore PillPack's access to the prescription data it needs. Some have argued that Amazon may want to avoid a legal battle with Surescripts over its data access policies, as such an action could draw unwanted attention to Amazon's own unscrupulous efforts to shut out competitors from user information.\n\nHowever, given the massive threat a Surescripts blackout would pose to Amazon's healthcare plans, I (Zach) think it's a risk the company is willing to take. And Amazon may have a firm leg to stand on if it pursues legal action against Surescripts' data withholding: In April, Surescripts was sued by the Federal Trade Commission over alleged \"illegal monopolization of e-prescription markets,\" for instance.\n\nBut whatever happens next, these legal roadblocks are certainly slowing Amazon and PillPack's expansion plans \u2014 meaning Amazon will want to put these legal challenges behind it sooner rather than later if it wants to maximize the potential return on its $750 million acquisition.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
