Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nIn parts of the United States, workers can be fired for filing a claim for workers\u2019 compensation. At some of our nation\u2019s assisted-living facilities, employees are not entitled to any compensation if they develop a bacterial infection on the job. Unlike in most European countries, workers\u2019 compensation in the U.S. does not typically cover injuries suffered while commuting to and from work. Meanwhile, the rates that employers now pay injured workers in the U.S. trail far behind both international standards and our nation\u2019s own historical ones. In 2015, a poultry worker lost an arm while toiling at a plant in Alabama. He received just $45,000 for his troubles.\n\nIn France, they do things a little differently. In 2013, a French engineer suffered a cardiac arrest while having an adulterous liaison with a stranger on a business trip. This week, a Paris court ruled that this tragedy qualified as an \u201cindustrial accident,\u201d and ordered the engineer\u2019s employer to pay the deceased man\u2019s family\u2019s up to 80 percent of his salary until what would have been the year of his retirement. According to reports from the Times of London and BBC, the French appeals court judges reasoned that a worker traveling on assignment \u201cis entitled to their employer\u2019s protection for the duration of their mission \u2026 whether or not the accident takes place as part of a professional activity or as an act of normal life.\u201d A 2016 lower court ruling in the same case had established that a \u201csexual encounter is an act of normal life like taking a shower or eating a meal.\u201d\n\nThis story has garnered tabloid attention in the Anglophone press because there is something amusing in the way its details seem to affirm some of our crudest stereotypes about the French (i.e., that their workers are pampered, that they view extramarital affairs as banal, everyday activities akin to showers or meals). But one shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the human tragedy at the heart of the matter. Someone lost her husband forever as a result of an embarrassing accident that might have never happened, were it not for the demands of his job. Let\u2019s hope that the court\u2019s decision brings the deceased\u2019s family a modicum of material and emotional relief \u2014 and inspires the American left to fight a bit harder for a United States where workers get what they deserve (and, perhaps in some cases, a little bit more).", "description": "A French man died after committing adultery on a business trip.
