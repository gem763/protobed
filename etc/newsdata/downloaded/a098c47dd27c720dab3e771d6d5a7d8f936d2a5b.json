Even among Republicans, support for the inquiry has jumped 21 points since July.\n\nTrump impeachment inquiry: EU ambassador blocked from testifying Read more\n\nThe Washington Post-Schar School poll released on Tuesday shows 58% support for the impeachment inquiry being conducted by Democrats in the House of Representatives, with 38% against.\n\nAlmost half of those polled, 49%, said the House should impeach Trump and recommend that he be removed from office.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, \u201cprevious Post-Schar School or Post-ABC News polls taken \u2026 this year found majorities of Americans opposing the start of an impeachment proceeding, with 37% to 41% saying they favoured such a step.\n\n\u201cThe recent revelations appear to have prompted many Americans to rethink their position.\u201d\n\nAn average of impeachment polls conducted by the website fivethirtyeight.com puts national support for impeachment at a little over 48% and opposition close to 44%.\n\nThe \u201crecent revelations\u201d driving public opinion are centered around Trump\u2019s conduct towards the leader of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelinskiy, particularly a 25 July phone call in which the US president sought to have his opposite number investigate Joe Biden, a likely rival for the White House, over unsubstantiated allegations of corruption.\n\nThe motivation for a temporary freezing of military aid to Ukraine, mandated by Trump, is also in question. In the Post-Schar School poll, 58% of respondents said the freezing of aid mattered when judging Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nThe furious partisan fight over impeachment intensified on Tuesday when the Trump administration blocked the US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland from testifying to House Democrats in private.\n\nWhatsApp messages released to Congress show Sondland and the Ukraine special envoy, Kurt Volker, who recently resigned that post, were involved in attempts to manage Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelinskiy.\n\nTrump said on Twitter Sondland had been prevented from appearing before \u201ca totally compromised kangaroo court where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public\u201d.\n\nBut the Post also pointed out indications that partisan attitudes to impeachment are shifting.\n\nNearly 80% of Democratic respondents now want Trump removed from office. Nearly 30% of Republicans support the impeachment inquiry, with nearly 20% favouring formal impeachment.\n\nIndependent support for the impeachment inquiry, a key factor, is at 57%, with 49% saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office.\n\nSome Senate Republicans have criticised Trump\u2019s behaviour over Ukraine but the upper chamber remains highly unlikely to convict the president should it be asked to do so.\n\nOffering its \u201cfive takes from early polls on impeachment\u201d, the Brookings Institution thinktank wrote: \u201cAlthough the past two weeks have shifted the political terrain \u2026 the Democrats continue to face high odds against succeeding, and there is no guarantee that a failed effort to remove the president from office will serve their electoral interests.\u201d", "description": "Washington Post-Schar School poll shows support for inquiry among Republicans has jumped since July", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/Trump_impeachment_copy.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eb9bafcf3efceba466e8749ba85a4d55", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
