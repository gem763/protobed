Drilling operations are expected to be problematic for Indigenous populations, many of which rely on subsistence hunting and fishing.\n\nTrump to claim US is environmental leader in spite of ripping up protections Read more\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House just hours earlier passed legislation to protect the area, but Republicans in the majority in the Senate are highly unlikely to approve the bill.\n\nThe Alaska Wilderness League\u2019s executive director Adam Kolton said that \u201cto no one\u2019s surprise, the administration chose the most aggressive leasing alternative, not even pretending that this is about restraint or meaningful protection\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith an eye on developing the entirety of the fragile coastal plain, the administration has been riding roughshod over science, silencing dissent and shutting out entire Indigenous communities,\u201d Kolton said.\n\nThe environmentally-sensitive area of Alaska\u2019s Arctic was forbidden for drilling until a change by Congress in an unrelated 2017 tax bill, which Kolton called a \u201csham of a vote\u201d.\n\nBLM on Thursday issued its final environmental impact statement for the project and said it aims to start granting leases by the end of the year.\n\nThe bureau estimates oil extracted and burned from the area could put the equivalent of between 0.7 million and 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere each year. At the maximum, that would be the same as roughly a million more cars on the road annually.\n\nIn reviews of a draft impact statement, the US Fish and Wildlife Service said the BLM underestimated the climate impacts of the oil leases.\n\nParts of BLM\u2019s final statement suggest \u2013 contrary to evidence \u2013 that the current rapid heating of the earth is cyclical rather than human-made.\n\n\u201cMuch attention in recent decades has focused on the potential climate change effects of GHGs [greenhouse gasses], especially carbon dioxide (CO2), which has been increasing in concentration in the global atmosphere since the end of the last ice age,\u201d the document said.\n\nGlobal scientists, however, have concluded that human actions, including burning fossil fuels, are the primary driver of the 1C temperature increase observed since industrialization.\n\nIn other sections, the document notes that fossil fuels contribute to greenhouse gases that heat the planet.", "description": "The Bureau of Land Management will offer leases to the 1.6m-acre coastal plain which is home to threatened polar bears", "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/311103c8afae477250db2e2ccb7c7c1c86464007/0_112_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=346e50362bcf2a713dfeccd0d4c37bd1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
