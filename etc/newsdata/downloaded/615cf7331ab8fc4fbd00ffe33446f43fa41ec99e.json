Trump also called into the show in mid-August, partly to talk up a potential Lewandowski Senate bid.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, the radio host said it seemed apparent Lewandowksi is not going to run. He had expected Lewandowski to announce on his show in the past week or two, though Lewandwoski has also said he would announce on \"Fox & Friends\" and potentially during his testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"It shows you the ripple effect of the impeachment inquiry back in New Hampshire,\" Heath said.\n\nLewandowski, who has been floating a bid for Senate since September, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His trial balloon triggered a backlash among some top New Hampshire Republicans.\n\nThe state's Democratic Party has been closely monitoring Lewandowski's public statements since began floating a run.\n\n\u201cWith or without Corey Lewandowski, New Hampshire Republicans are in a nasty primary among candidates all committed to protecting a corrupt President determined to take away health care from thousands of people in the Granite State,\" party spokesman Joshua Marcus-Blank said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cc/f2/e6f63ce048798ee92fc6d8492d0a/191001-corey-lewandowski-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
