He wants to have an element of mystery and will never disclose anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there will be loads of evidence and I am adamant that Halliwell is a serial killer, one of the worst in history.\n\n\u201cIt just makes me sick. They should be doing more to help the loved ones of his victims so they can give them the burial they should have.\u201d And Joan said: \u201cHow could they possibly put in such a small amount?\n\n\u201cIf there are so many other victims how far can this go?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an insignificant figure. Victims\u2019 families want peace and they\u2019ll never get it with this level of investment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s law in this country but \u00adunfortunately not a lot of justice.\u201d\n\nEx-Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher, who put Halliwell behind bars, said Claudia\u2019s disappearance \u201cfits Halliwell\u2019s pattern of behaviour\u201d of abducting women walking alone late at night or early in the morning.\n\nOnly two of Halliwell\u2019s \u00ad\u201ctrophy\u201d items have ever been \u00adidentified.\n\nOne was a cardigan worn by Becky, who disappeared in Swindon in 2003 and a high-heeled boot that Sian was wearing before she was abducted in 2011.\n\nHalliwell is feared to have killed up to 12 more women including Claudia, mum-of-four Linda Razzell who the killer was said to be obsessed with after doing building work at her home, and \u00aduniversity \u00adgraduate Melanie Hall, who disappeared in 1996 after leaving a nightclub in Bath.\n\nHalliwell could be linked to further unsolved murders including those of Julie Finley, Carol Clark, Jackie Waines and Yvonne Fitt.\n\nBecky\u2019s mum Karen has carried out her own investigations, and in 2017 discovered a possible link between Halliwell and Claudia Lawrence.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHer enquiries uncovered a witness who claimed Halliwell had been seen talking to Claudia through a taxi \u00adwindow before she vanished in York in March 2009.\n\nHalliwell\u2019s dad lived in Huddersfield, an hour from Claudia\u2019s home, giving him a link to the Yorkshire area.\n\nKaren said at the time: \u201cThe description of Claudia\u2019s [alleged] murderer is identical to [Christopher Halliwell] \u2013 a left-handed smoker, 5ft 8-10ins, with slightly receding hair and a skinny build.\n\n\"Claudia was asking if he had change so she could ring her dad from a call box.\u201d Officers at Wiltshire Police initially refused to say how much they were spending on the cold case review.\n\nThey claimed the information would \u201cfurther perpetuate the distress of the family, friends and those who knew Becky and Sian\u201d.\n\nBut after the Sunday People \u00adappealed against the decision, cops admitted the dedicated fund was no more than \u00a340,000.\n\nRetired police chief Kevin Moore, who led a review into the hunt for 13-year-old Milly Dowler\u2019s killer Levi Bellfield, 50, said: \u201cIn policing terms this figure is \u00adpeanuts.\u201d\n\nMr Moore revealed he once spent \u00a3700,000 on a forensic dig linked to Scottish serial killer Peter Tobin.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe ex-Chief Superintendent of Sussex Police said: \u201c\u00a340,000 will not go very far at all.\n\n\"What it says to me is that this is simply an \u00adappeasement exercise \u00adbecause the force are under pressure and Halliwell\u2019s crimes won\u2019t go away.\n\n\u201cThey need to be seen to be doing something.\n\n\u201cBut if you consider the costs of forensics, especially on the 60 items of clothing they discovered, this is a drop in the ocean.\u201d\n\nHalliwell murdered Sian O\u2019Callaghan just two minutes after she got into his cab in Swindon on March 19, 2011. She had been brutally beaten and stabbed.\n\nHaving guided cops to the remote spot where he had dumped her body, Halliwell suddenly \u00adconfessed: \u201cI\u2019m a sick f***er. I need help. Do you want \u00adanother one?\u201d\n\nThe fiend then revealed where cops could find Becky\u2019s body \u2013 who police did not even know was missing.\n\nCatching a double killer led to Det Supt Fulcher being hailed a hero by the families and twice \u00adnominated for the Queen\u2019s Police Medal.\n\nBut his decision to break police guidelines and drive Halliwell to where he thought Sian might be found alive, instead of taking him to the police \u00adstation for a formal interview, cost him his job.\n\nHalliwell was convicted in 2016 of murdering Becky and given a whole life sentence.\n\nDet Supt Jeremy Carter, of Wiltshire Police, said: \u201cThe figure of \u00a340,000 does not cover any of the salaries of those working on this case but relates purely to specialist work such as forensic digs and searches, and specific expert advice.\n\n\u201cOfficers working on this case carry out a vast amount of work as part of their daily duties which would not be \u00adcaptured in this figure.\n\n\u201cThe force continue to maintain dedicated staff who work on this job.\u201d\n\nPOTENTIAL VICTIMS OF CHRISTOPHER HALLIWELL\n\nCLAUDIA LAWRENCE\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nChef Claudia Lawrence, 35, disappeared between the night of March 18 and morning of March 19 2009 in York.\n\nA witness later said he saw Christopher Halliwell talking to Claudia through a taxi window. Halliwell\u2019s absent father once lived \u201ca few streets\u201d from where she was last seen and it is possible he knew the historic city.\n\nSALLY ANN JOHN\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSex worker Sally Ann John, 24, vanished in September 1995 near Christopher Halliwell\u2019s Swindon home.\n\nDespite continuous appeals, she has never been found.\n\nShe allegedly sent a postcard shortly after she disappeared - but police later ruled this as a fake.\n\nSANDRA BREWIN\n\nSandra Brewin disappeared from her parents\u2019 home in 1994 aged 21 just months after she became pen-friends with a man in prison in Oxfordshire.\n\nLINDA RAZZELL\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nMUM-of-four Linda Razzell, 41, disappeared from Swindon in 2002.
