They have been in a legal war ever since.\n\nBy 1030 GMT shares in Mediaset Espana fell 1.4% having extended losses following the court ruling. Shares in Mediaset were broadly flat.\n\nNeither Vivendi or Mediaset was immediately available for comment.", "description": "Spanish court puts Mediaset's pan-European plan on hold", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9A14A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
