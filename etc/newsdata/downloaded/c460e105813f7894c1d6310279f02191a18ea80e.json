It\u2019s wonderful, thrilling, exhausting, terrifying, amazing and hard. Becoming a new parent of multiple children at once? That\u2019s a whole different ballgame.\n\nParents of multiples have a different experience than new parents of single children, or even of parents with children who are very close in age. So I asked the members of our Offspring Facebook Parenting Group \u2014 many of whom are parents of twins or triplets \u2014 what advice they have for those who are starting on the multi-baby journey.\n\nLower your expectations\n\nFor most parents, the lowering of one\u2019s expectations usually happens around the time the second child arrives; in the case of parents of multiples, that means lowering them immediately. Parenting two (or more!) newborns and then two toddlers and then two preschoolers simultaneously will not be same as it would have been if there were just one, Brittany says:\n\nRealise that your experience is going to be VERY different than those with singletons. A lot of times, I\u2019ve pined for the experiences that a lot of my friends have (easily taking their kids to restaurants, stores, etc.), but it just ain\u2019t gonna happen.\n\nIt ain\u2019t gonna happen, so let yourself off the hook a little. The house will be messier, the laundry will pile higher and you\u2019ll be later to everything than your friends who are wrangling just one.\n\nEmbrace the crying\n\nOr, if you can\u2019t exactly embrace it, at least buckle in and get comfortable with it, says group member Robin, who has one-year-old twins:\n\nWith multiples, you can\u2019t be afraid of crying, because someone is going to be crying. You deal with them one at a time and everything will be fine. In that vein, I sleep-trained, which I know can be controversial, but it doesn\u2019t help anyone if no one is getting more than three hours of sleep at a time after 6 months ... Otherwise, I don\u2019t know if there are really hacks to twin-parenting, but more of a mindset \u2014 stay calm, try to do something, and everything will be fine.\n\nI love the simplicity of \u201ctry to do something.\u201d Solid advice for so much of the parenting experience.\n\nCultivate their individuality\n\nOf course you know they\u2019re not the same kid just because they look so much alike \u2014 but if it\u2019s easy to compare your baby to a similar-age baby of a friend, it\u2019s all the more so when you\u2019ve got two right in front of you who are doing different things on different schedules.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll develop at their own pace and be into different things at different times,\u201d group member Oscar says. \u201cKeep comparisons to a minimum.\u201d\n\nOscar also emphasises the need for each child to have their own things they don\u2019t have to share all the time \u2014 and ideally, they wouldn\u2019t share you all the time either. Try to build one-on-one time in with each of them as your schedule allows (even if that\u2019s as simple as running errands with one child while your partner stays home with the others).\n\nHave some containment options\n\nYou simply cannot be in two places at once and there will be (many) times when you need to tend to one child and keep the other one safe and contained. One option recommended by Lauren in the Facebook group is this KidCo GoPod, which contains a child like a pack \u2018n play or a jumper, but \u201cfolds up super easily, and thus can be quickly moved and dropped anywhere in the house.\u201d\n\nBaby-wearing is another good containment option, says Clovis: \u201cA friend with multiples swears by using a carrier and transitioning to back-carry as soon as is healthy. She says that when both kids need her, she can put one on the back and deal with the other with both hands.\u201d\n\nAnd for dinnertime prep, once the kids are standing, a platform for the kitchen could be key. \u201cPut them up there with some Play-Doh on the counter and they can pretend to help, while you get work done and they stay in sight,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cA little expensive if you buy them online, but we got ours via Facebook Marketplace, and they would be easy to build, as well.\u201d\n\nConnect with other parents of multiples\n\nAll new parents can benefit from connecting with other new parents to share in the journey and lean on for support or advice. Parents of multiples especially need this, Julie says.\n\nFinding other twin/multiples families is a really important thing, I think. When I met (virtually or in person) other people with twins, I immediately felt relief, because they get it and they\u2019ve been through it, too.\n\nOne place for this is the \u201cParents of Multiples\u201d board on Reddit, where you\u2019ll find everything from nervous multiple-parents-to-be, to questions about feeding and sleep schedules to endless adorable pictures of babies and toddlers. And, Alissa says, it\u2019s a treasure trove of information about parenting multiples.\n\n\u201cIf you go there and search specific keywords,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s pretty much been asked and answered before.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll say it again: Lower your standards\n\nA lot of the advice from our parenting group boils down to one key tactic: acceptance. There are routines you can put in place to make things more manageable, there are things you can do to make the day-to-day a little less daunting, but ultimately, accepting that it\u2019s going to be hard is important.\n\n\u201cDitto a lot of the above, ESPECIALLY the lowering of the standards,\u201d Julie says. \u201cAnd then lower them some more. Ignore all your singleton friends who are trying to be Perfect Pinterest Mothers. Because that is bullshit and you don\u2019t have time for that nonsense. Do what you can, do what works for you, and ignore anyone else.\u201d\n\nWhat else should we add to this list? If you\u2019re a parent of multiples, tell us: How do you do it? What little tricks saved you during diaper-changes or nighttime feedings? How do you get out the door in the morning, and how do you find time for yourself?", "description": "Becoming a new parent is, well, hard.
