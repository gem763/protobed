The breakthrough comes from Russia, where Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian host Vladimir Putin signed a short agreement on how security should be provided along the Syrian-Turkish border. So apparently Washington\u2019s threat to use military force against its NATO ally Turkey won\u2019t have to be backed by actual Tomahawk missile barrages.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ankara says \u2018no need to start new Syria offensive\u2019 after Erdogan-Putin talks\n\nThe agreement provides for the withdrawal of Kurdish militias, whom Ankara considers terrorists, back from a border zone, with Syrian government forces stepping in as border guards. Turkey gets to keep, for now, the part of territory that it seized over the previous days, but is no longer trying to seize the entire length of the border with its many Kurdish settlements. Russian military police will be deployed as well, including for joint patrols with Turkish soldiers to ensure that everybody keeps calm and stays away from their enemies.\n\nA win for Russian brand of diplomacy\n\nThe arrangement has proven that Russia can act as a mediator in a very complex situation and avert the worst outcomes, like massive loss of civilian life that many predicted could happen if the situation in northeastern Syria escalated, Grigory Lukyanov, senior lecturer at the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics, told RT.\n\n\u201cRussia is taking upon itself certain responsibilities that the United States failed to deliver, both to the Syrian Kurds and to Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was taken in all seriousness in the region and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump \u2018fully prepared\u2019 for military action against Turkey \u2013 Pompeo\n\nThe Syrian Kurds enjoyed American protection from Turkey after playing the role of ground forces for the US-backed military campaign targeting jihadists in Syria. But Ankara was irritated by the US arming and training Kurdish militias, seeing them as a threat to its national security. Washing hands of them subjected Trump to fierce criticism at home, with commenters accusing him of greenlighting a massacre. The Russian-Turkish deal seems to have averted that scenario.\n\n\u201cThe main goal of the agreement was to suspend the military aspect of the Turkish Operation Spring of Peace,\u201d Lukyanov said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the deal is implemented in practice. As far as we know, both Turkish and Russian leadership have vested interest in the deal to work.\u201d\n\nNot much of a defeat for Washington\n\nThe expert warned against treating the development as a humiliating defeat for Washington, contrary to what some observers in the United States and in Russia say. \u201cSeeing everything in the context of Russian-American relations is counterproductive. The situation in Syria proves it,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe surprise American pullout puts it into a stronger negotiation position with Turkey and is actually half-hearted. Washington seems to have no intention to evacuate its military base from the Syrian-Jordanian border. And it will even keep military presence in the Kurdish lands, just not at the border with Turkey.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ditch the Kurds, grab the oil? Trump says US \u2018never committed\u2019 to Syrian allies, but SecDef says Washington still committed to oil\n\nOf course \u201csecuring the oil\u201d is morally a far worse justification for having boots on the ground than \u201cdefeating terrorists\u201d or \u201cprotecting our allies,\u201d Ruslan Mamedov, a Middle East analyst from the Russian International Affairs Council, a Moscow-based think-tank, told RT. The US president may try to score a few political points from taking those troops out closer to the 2020 election in the US.\n\n\u201cTrump may declare another withdrawal of troops from Syria as part of his reelection strategy just to say \u2018I promised it and I have delivered.\u2019 Even if in practice some of the troops stay,\u201d he said.\n\nThe continued American military presence in Syria no longer serves the goals of US foreign policy, Lukyanov said. After all, Washington seems uninterested in how the post-war transition in the country will unfold.\n\n\u201cThe Russian-Turkish deal, on the contrary, was signed by the sides directly involved in determining Syria\u2019s future and interested in an expedited resolution of the conflict,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "A Russian-Turkish deal on security arrangements in northeastern Syria is a major win for Moscow\u2019s diplomatic approach, but Washington was hardly crushed by it, Middle East experts tell RT.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db0517685f54023822b9985.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
