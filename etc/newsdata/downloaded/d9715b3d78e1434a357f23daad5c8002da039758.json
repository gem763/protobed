REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli/File Photo\n\nIn selling international reserves for the first time in 10 years to meet demand for dollars, while slashing interest rates to new lows to revive growth, the blue water between monetary and exchange rate policy is becoming ever clearer, analysts say.\n\nIn some ways, the central bank\u2019s bold action on rates is unsurprising: the economy flirted with recession and is struggling to grow, inflation is well below target, the government has made clear fiscal support is off limits, and central banks around the world are easing aggressively too.\n\nThe big difference now, according to observers, is that the bank\u2019s policy-making committee known as \u2018Copom\u2019 under Campos Neto\u2019s guidance is far less concerned with the spillover effect on the exchange rate.\n\nAs long as the so-called \u2018pass through\u2019 to inflation from a weakening currency is limited, it can reduce the benchmark Selic to spur growth and inflation, while any unwanted currency depreciation or volatility can be met with direct intervention via the sale of dollars.\n\n\u201cThey are under pressure to deliver growth. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a policy to weaken the currency explicitly, but if the exchange rate keeps weakening without causing inflation, they will tolerate it,\u201d said one former colleague.\n\n\u201cThey are seeing interest rates and FX separately. It\u2019s a new approach. I don\u2019t like it much,\u201d he said.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s actions and statements since it cut the Selic rate by half a percentage point to a then low of 6.00% on July 31, and markets\u2019 reaction to them, are instructive.\n\nThe real lost 8% of its value in August, its biggest monthly fall in four years, and market-based interest rates steadily fell to fresh lows as Campos Neto repeatedly said \u201cbenign\u201d inflation allowed for \u201cfurther adjustments\u201d in policy.\n\nThe statement accompanying last week\u2019s rate cut to 5.00% was even more dovish than analysts had expected, prompting another sell-off in the currency and steep decline in implied interest rates. Several economists slashed their forecasts, with French bank BNP Paribas going as low as 4.25% by February next year.\n\nYet inflation expectations are well-anchored. Even Copom\u2019s \u201chybrid\u201d model based on the market\u2019s consensus Selic forecast and the current exchange rate - that is, the lowest available levels for both - showed inflation next year at 3.80%, below the bank\u2019s official target of 4.00%.\n\nThis is encouraging policymakers to keep their foot on the easing pedal.\n\n(Graphic: Brazil interest rate vs inflation, here)\n\nTRADER, TREASURER, BANKER\n\nNot everyone agrees that there is a major policy shift under way. But a consensus is forming that a mix of low growth and inflation calls for more rate cuts, while dollar outflows from Brazilian companies paying down foreign debt and large FX reserves open up the potential for FX intervention.\n\nEspecially with a market-savvy former trader at the helm.\n\n\u201cHe was a trader, a treasurer, and a banker, so maybe that makes him more at ease pursuing these kind of interventions. In a way though, it\u2019s not a major shift, but perhaps a new way of intervening that reflects a new reality,\u201d said Carlos Kawall, chief economist at Banco Safra in Sao Paulo.\n\nCampos Neto earlier this month defended the landmark decision in August to sell dollars on the spot currency market for the first time since 2009, and indicated it may not be the last time.\n\n\u201cForeign exchange interventions act as a mechanism of stability in the foreign exchange market,\u201d he said.\n\nA central bank spokesman declined to comment for this article.\n\n(Graphic: Brazil FX reserves vs dollar/real, tmsnrt.rs/2mzilZV)\n\nOne former central bank director said this separation between monetary and exchange rate policies already existed, but the move to sell international dollar reserves outright marked a \u201csignificant\u201d change from the previous administration.\n\nPreviously, pockets of illiquidity or dollar demand mismatches would tend to appear in the derivatives markets, so the central bank would intervene with currency swap or credit lines operations.\n\nNow, the shortage of dollars is manifesting itself in the spot market, which is where the central bank has acted for the first time since February 2009. Crucially, as Campos Neto has indicated, last month\u2019s sale of just under $4 billion may not be the last.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People walk outside the central bank headquarters building in Brasilia, Brazil, September 6, 2017. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/File Photo\n\nAlexandre Schwartsman, director of international affairs at the central bank from 2003 to 2006, doesn\u2019t buy into the idea that there\u2019s much of a shift under way at all. But he recognizes that market and economic conditions are such that different policy actions can now be considered.\n\nCentral to this are inflation and inflation expectations, both of which are firmly anchored despite the weakening exchange rate. As long as this remains the case, the central bank can continue lowering rates and chipping away at its mountain of FX reserves.\n\n\u201cThe central bank will intervene when it thinks there is a lack of liquidity in the market,\u201d Schwartsman said. \u201cBrazil has $380 billion of reserves, I\u2019m pretty sure we can afford to use some of that to ease the liquidity problem, even if only in a small way it helps reduce public debt.\u201d", "description": "Seven months into the presidency of Roberto Campos Neto, Brazil's central bank has implemented a quiet revolution in its monetary policy, with the former trader showing a willingness to tolerate a weaker currency.", "authors": ["Jamie Mcgeever", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433753182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O13U", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
