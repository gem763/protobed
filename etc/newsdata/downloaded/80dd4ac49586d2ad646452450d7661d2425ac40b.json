That was a very special day for me and it is a very special day for Brigid today.\"\n\nFarah endured a day to forget as he found himself cast adrift by the halfway stage of his title defence and eventually finished in a disappointing two hours, nine minutes and 58 seconds.\n\nFarah had sparked controversy in the pre-event build-up when he implied there were racial elements in questioning over his relationship with the disgraced coach Alberto Salazar.\n\nCherono won a dramatic sprint finish to take his second major marathon title of the year in front of Ethiopian pair Dejene Debela and Asefa Mengstu.\n\nPA", "description": "Paula Radcliffe has seen her 16-year-old women's marathon world record shattered by Brigid Kosgei as the Kenyan set a new mark of two hours, 14 minutes and four seconds in Chicago.
