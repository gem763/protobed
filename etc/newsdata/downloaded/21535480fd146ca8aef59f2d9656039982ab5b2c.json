REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Illustration/File Photo\n\nThe warning from the watchdog comes after it found growing examples of social media posts, especially on TikTok, featuring flight attendants grooving to popular tunes or lip-syncing movie dialogues while inside an aircraft.\n\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all airlines to rein in such behavior and will soon seek a compliance report, said a senior official at the department.\n\n\u201cWe have issued instructions and told them these are unbecoming,\u201d a DGCA official said, adding a letter had also been sent to airlines about \u201ctheatrical performances\u201d by crew members that could put passenger safety at risk.\n\nA TikTok video showing a SpiceJet cabin crew member smiling and walking down the aisle of an airplane full of passengers was reported by local Indian media this week, drawing criticism from people on social media.\n\nSpiceJet Ltd said in a statement on Friday that its crew members were strictly prohibited from shooting pictures or videos onboard and it took strict action against violators.\n\nAirAsia India said it ensured its staff adhered to strict internal guidelines for social media usage.\n\nIndiGo said it had received the communication from the regulator and would take appropriate action where required.\n\nVistara said expectations on employees\u2019 use of social media were clearly laid out in its social media guidelines and in the training provided.\n\nOwned by China\u2019s ByteDance, TikTok is one of the world\u2019s most popular apps.

Hashtags such as #crewlife, #flightattendant are often used for videos involving airline crew and have around 170 million views on the platform.\n\nThis week, Reuters found dozens of videos that showed crew from airlines such as IndiGo, AirAsia India and Vistara, part-owned by Singapore Airlines, singing, dancing or ramp walking along an aircraft\u2019s aisle.\n\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne TikTok video from a user, who identified herself as \u201c#Dancer #cabincrew #indigo\u201d, showed her and another flight attendant wearing uniform and dancing to a Bollywood song inside a plane and blowing a kiss to the camera.\n\nIn another video, a TikTok user wearing a shirt with a Vistara logo and a fluorescent safety jacket on top is seen dancing to a popular DJ Snake song on an airport apron, with a plane seen in the background.\n\nEarlier this week, Vistara\u2019s chief commercial officer Sanjiv Kapoor told staff in an internal email that posting photos inside or outside aircraft that don\u2019t meet the company\u2019s guidelines was not permitted, and only smart and classy photos that showed the airline in a positive light were allowed.\n\n\u201cBut goofy/immature/tacky/cheap \u201ctik-tok type\u201d photos and videos are strictly prohibited,\u201d Kapoor wrote in his e-mail, seen by Reuters, while also referring to the regulator\u2019s recent notice.", "description": "India's aviation regulator has told airlines to crack down on the behavior of flight crew after several videos on popular Chinese video app TikTok showed crew members singing and dancing while on duty, a senior official told Reuters.", "authors": ["Aditi Shah", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431988912&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J17T", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
