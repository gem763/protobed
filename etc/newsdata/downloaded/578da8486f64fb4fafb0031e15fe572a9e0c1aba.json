Voters have only failed to re-elect an incumbent candidate to a second term on four occasions in the country\u2019s history, but recent polls show Trudeau\u2019s approval hovering around record lows, making him vulnerable against the former youngest-ever Speaker of the House of Commons:\n\nWith both candidates polling just above 30%, the winner will likely have to form a coalition with smaller parties in addition to working with a fragmented Parliament, but it\u2019s still worth exploring what their economic policies may mean for the loonie and the Canadian economy more broadly. Starting with the obvious: the Canadian economy has performed relatively well under Trudeau\u2019s tenure, with unemployment levels near record lows, inflation subdued, and the stock market hitting a record high last month, though GDP growth has moderated to below 2% this year.\n\nBeyond voters\u2019 evaluation of the candidates\u2019 personalities, the biggest policy-related issue will be around the environment. Trudeau has a stated goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and exceed the country\u2019s 2030 carbon emission goals. By contrast Scheer plans to eliminate the country\u2019s carbon tax if elected. Therefore, a victory for Scheer may provide a short-term boost to the country\u2019s economy, and by extension, the Canadian dollar, though the longer-term outlook is more questionable.\n\nOutside of the election, the loonie has also benefited from strong economic data this week, with the ADP jobs reportt coming in better than anticipated (with strong revisions) and a better-than-expected manufacturing sales report. Technically speaking, the loonie has been the strongest major currency year-to-date and peeked out to an 11-week high against the US dollar just yesterday:", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: .
