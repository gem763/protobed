It is not yet clear how they died, whether they froze or suffocated.\n\nWhat happened in Belgium?\n\nThe lorry was standing in a car park beside the E34 motorway at Oud-Turnhout.\n\nThe motorway runs from Zeebrugge to Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia region.\n\nThe destination of the lorry was not given.\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants attempt to enter the UK illegally via European ferry ports, typically hiding in vehicles.\n\nRefrigerated lorries are often targeted because it is easier to bypass heat scanners that way, a spokeswoman for Belgian transport federation Febetra said.\n\nFebetra has been calling for safer motorway parking to tackle the problem, Isabelle De Maegt told Belgian broadcaster VRT.", "description": "Police find 12 stowaways from Syria and Sudan inside a truck parked by a motorway in Antwerp province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A9B6/production/_109464434_gettyimages-882666834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
