More than 20 people were airlifted to safety in New Providence island, some with serious injuries.\n\nLarge areas of Grand Bahama, including the popular tourist resort of Freeport, remained under water.\n\n\u201cThe reality of it all is, unfortunately, we will see more deaths. I can\u2019t see any way out of it,\u201d Marvin Dames, the Bahamas minister of national security, told reporters. He added that several of the confirmed dead were children.\n\nMillions in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina evacuated inland as Dorian, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of modern times, began to menace the American mainland.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami said in its 11am advisory winds had dropped to almost half the speed of the 200mph gusts that pounded Abaco island at landfall on Sunday.\n\nBut the size of the storm was increasing, senior hurricane specialist Dan Brown reported, with hurricane-force winds stretching 60 miles from its core and tropical storm-force winds up to 175mph.\n\nWhile Dorian\u2019s center is no longer predicted to make a Florida landfall, according to the NHC, the storm is still expected to deliver a powerful blow.\n\n\u201cThe increasing size of Dorian\u2019s windfield along with any deviation to the left of the forecast track will bring hurricane-force winds onshore along portions of the Florida east coast,\u201d Brown said.\n\nDorian\u2019s projected path saw it hugging the Florida coastline for the next 24 to 36 hours, close to the Florida-Georgia border by Wednesday evening and grazing the Carolinas through Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe storm has been difficult to predict because of constant atmospheric changes in the Atlantic and Caribbean which left Dorian parked over Grand Bahama for so long.\n\n\u201cSomebody once told me a hurricane is like an elephant on roller-skates,\u201d severe weather expert Jim Lushine, a retired NHC forecaster, told the Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a very sharp turn. It has to slow down tremendously before it can turn.\u201d\n\nIn Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday the scene was eerily quiet, 36 hours ahead of the expected arrival of tropical storm force winds. The city, with a group of other Georgian coastal counties, was placed under an evacuation order on Monday by Governor Brian Kemp.\n\nMatthew Aylen wades through waist deep water as he is rescued during Hurricane Dorian in Freeport, Bahamas, on Tuesday.
