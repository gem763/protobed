Returning to her roots \u2013 and carrying the weight of representation \u2013 terrified her\n\nSampa the Great was terrified before she stepped on stage to play her first ever show in Africa earlier this year. The show was in the Zambian capital of Lusaka \u2013 and the artist, MC and poet\u2019s cousins were in the front row.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m based in Australia and all the monumental moments in my career have happened there,\u201d says Sampa (born Sampa Tembo). \u201cBut I\u2019m from Zambia. My fear was that they wouldn\u2019t get it \u2013 and their opinion matters most.\u201d She sums up her concerns: \u201cA person coming out of Africa and playing globally while still being themselves and pushing for their own culture \u2013 to go home and not be understood.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the shows went well. \u201cThey sang back to me \u2013 it was amazing.\u201d But Sampa\u2019s anxieties weren\u2019t unfounded. Raised between Zambia and Botswana, she left for California at 19. A few years later, in 2013, she moved to Sydney in 2013 study music production and met like minds at weekly hip-hop and jazz sessions. Her second release, Birds and the BEE9 (2017), won the Australian music prize \u2013 a $30,000 cash award modelled on the Mercury prize \u2013 and she\u2019s since supported Lauryn Hill and Kendrick Lamar, and played Glastonbury and the lauded Tasmanian experimental festival, Dark Mofo.\n\nSampa the Great: Birds and the BEE9 review \u2013 an intriguing appetiser Read more\n\nAll the while, she was craving home \u2013 Zambia. \u201cIt was affecting my joy,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I went home and they were like, \u2018You\u2019re different.\u2019 People can hear the change, the displacement, in the way I speak [Bantu language] Bemba. It shook my core. I became the diaspora, which was a perspective I had sympathised with but didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have myself. I didn\u2019t expect to be the displaced one.\u201d\n\nThe Return, her new album out this month, delves deep into themes of home, heritage, displacement and freedom. Amid its viscous swirl of Afrobeat, R&B and neo-soul is Sampa\u2019s taut and assured rapping, the hard centre of songs that billow out to six, seven, even nine minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s been a complex ascent for Sampa. \u201cPeople were labelling me Australian hip-hop without finishing the sentence \u2013 \u2018from Zambia, based in Australia\u2019. I felt a sense of being lost in that narrative because it wasn\u2019t fully describing who I am.\u201d Her career was growing so fast \u201con a different continent\u201d that people from home were believing this narrative.\n\nShe was thrust into a role she says she wasn\u2019t ready for. \u201cYou walk into an industry that doesn\u2019t look like you and you become an ambassador because there\u2019s not a lot of representation. I was afraid I\u2019d do something that would reflect wrongly on a whole group of people.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Everything had to be westernised to be cool. It\u2019s only recently where that\u2019s changed\u2019 ... Sampa the Great. Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian\n\nTo cope, she \u201cstood back\u201d for a while. The Return features an interlude called Wake Up \u2013 a voicemail from an exasperated friend. \u201cYour phone\u2019s still off,\u201d she says. \u201cSampa! For real. Everyone\u2019s calling me because they can\u2019t get through to you \u2026 I don\u2019t think you have time for all this finding yourself spiritual shit.\u201d\n\nIt was a wake-up call \u2013 one of several. \u201cMy friend understood I had this huge weight. But she said, \u2018It can\u2019t stop you. You are a black artist, yes \u2013 but you\u2019re an artist and you create.\u2019 It was a speech she probably gave me 100 times.\u201d\n\nThe pieces began to fall into place. She returned to Africa in April to film the record\u2019s videos, playing shows in Lusaka, Johannesburg and Swaziland. If people were erasing her African heritage, and if her African home didn\u2019t know her as an artist, then she would rewind the tape to where she was raised \u201cby a Bemba mother and Tumbuka father\u201d and show them.\n\nFinal Form is The Return\u2019s defining video and one of the most thrilling clips of the year. It features traditional Nyau dancers in feathered masks and headdresses, documentary-style street footage and contemporary dancers chanting, \u201cBlack power.\u201d\n\nThe Return also features her sister Mwanje\u2019s vocals and samples of her mother, Theresa, while both her Botswana-based parents are in the video for OMG. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen my parents now. You\u2019ve seen the school I went to in Botswana,\u201d says Sampa. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re going to describe me, that\u2019s your business, but add it on to my actual narrative.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sampa the Great: Final Form \u2013 video\n\nShe incorporates Bemba, too, as well as South African slang. \u201cHip-hop is African-American culture and most of my projects were in English because I thought that was how it was done. Bemba is my mum\u2019s language and something I didn\u2019t associate with hip-hop. Subconsciously, growing up, speaking for my generation of African youth, it was uncool to rock where we were from. Everything had to be westernised to be cool. It\u2019s only recently that\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nSampa The Great, Spod, and Boy & Bear: best Australian music for July Read more\n\nThe Return has a broader purpose, part of which involved Sampa processing some of the \u201cfriction\u201d she experienced while living in the US. \u201cAn African-American told me to go back to Africa,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t reply. I was shocked. But you step back and come to the realisation: here\u2019s a person who\u2019s had to recreate their whole identity because of history. And it\u2019s an identity we all love and profit from.\u201d\n\nShe talks of the need for Africans to treat everyone who is displaced or in the diaspora as family. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to physically come back,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, if they do want to, that sense of brotherly-sisterly family love needs to be open for them.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Return is released on Ninja Tune on 13 September.", "description": "Raised in Zambia, the rapper moved to the US and made her name in Australia.
