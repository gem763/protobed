Beijing did not specify the value of the goods that face higher tariffs from Sunday.\n\nThe extra tariffs of 5% and 10% were levied on 1,717 items of a total of 5,078 products originating from the United States. Beijing will start collecting additional tariffs on the rest from Dec. 15.\n\nTrump on Sunday cited comments from U.S. economist Peter Morici, who claims the tariffs will not impact U.S. consumers that much given a drop in the Chinese currency, and called on U.S. companies to find suppliers outside of China.\n\n\"We don\u2019t want to be servants to the Chinese!\" he said. \"This is about American Freedom. Redirect the supply chain. There is no reason to buy everything from China!\"\n\nLater, he told reporters that talks with China were continuing and the two sides would meet in person in September.\n\n\"We are talking to China, the meeting is still on, as you know, in September,\" he said. \"We'll see what happens, but we can't allow China to rip us off anymore as a country.\"\n\nChinese state media struck a defiant note.\n\n\"The United States should learn how to behave like a responsible global power and stop acting as a 'school bully,'\" the official Xinhua news agency said.\n\n\"As the world's only superpower, it needs to shoulder its due responsibility, and join other countries in making this world a better and more prosperous place. Only then can America become great again.\"\n\nTariffs could not impede China's development, said the official People's Daily of the ruling Communist Party.\n\n\"China's booming economy has made China a fertile ground for investment that foreign companies cannot ignore,\" it said, in a commentary under the name 'Zhong Sheng', or 'Voice of China', which is often used to state its view on foreign policy issues.\n\nLast month, Trump said he was increasing existing and planned tariffs by 5% on about $550-billion worth of Chinese imports after Beijing announced its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nTariffs of 15% on cellphones, laptop computers, toys and clothing are to take effect on Dec. 15.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's Office said on Thursday it would collect public comments through Sept. 20 on a planned tariff increase to 30% on a $250-billion list of goods already hit with a 25% tariff.\n\nTrade teams from China and the United States continue to talk and will meet in September, but tariff hikes on Chinese goods set to go in place on Sunday will not be delayed, Trump has said.\n\nFor two years, the Trump administration has sought to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms, industrial subsidies and market access.\n\nChina has consistently denied Washington's accusations that it engages in unfair trade practices, vowing to fight back in kind and criticizing U.S. measures as protectionist.\n\nChina has pressed the United States to cancel the tariff increase, but said last week that a September round of talks was being discussed between the two.\n\nThe trade war further strains Beijing-Washington ties, already overshadowed by U.S. freedom of navigation exercises near Chinese-occupied islands in the disputed South China Sea, and U.S. support for self-ruled and democratic Taiwan, which China claims as its own.\n\nTrump has also linked the trade talks and the protests in Hong Kong, saying he believes the negotiations with the United States had led Beijing to be more restrained in its response to the demonstrations in Hong Kong.", "description": "China, U.S. kick off new round of tariffs in trade war", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8013G_L.jpg"}
