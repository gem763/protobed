Hong Kong police had no immediate comment.\n\nThe app was removed from Apple's app store globally but continued to work for users who had previously downloaded it in Hong Kong, Reuters found. A web version was also still viewable on iPhones.\n\nOn Tuesday, the People's Daily said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth. Making the app available on Apple's Hong Kong App Store at this time was\"opening the door\" to violent protesters in the former British colony, the newspaper wrote.\n\nAsked for comment after the People's Daily piece was published, HKmap.live's developer, who has not revealed his or her identity, said the app merely consolidated information that was available in the public domain, such as groups on Telegram, another service protestors were using to communicate.\n\n\"Protest is part of our freedom of speach (sic) and I don't think the application is illegal in HK,\" the developer told Reuters in a direct message on Tuesday.\n\nUnder Apple's rules and policies, apps that meet its standards to appear in the App Store have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.\n\nIn 2011, Apple modified its app store to remove apps that listed locations for drunken driving checkpoints not previously published by law enforcement officials.\n\nWord of the HKmap.live app's removal spread quickly in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Does the entire world have to suck up to the garbage Communist Party?\" one commentator called Yip Lou Jie said in an online forum, LIHKG, which is used by protestors in Hong Kong.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Apple Inc on Wednesday removed an app that protestors in Hong Kong have used to track police movements from its app store, saying it violated rules because it was used to ambush police.
