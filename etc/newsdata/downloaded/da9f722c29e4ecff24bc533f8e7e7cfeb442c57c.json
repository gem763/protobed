Constellation Brands , the brewer that makes Corona and Modelo beers, announced the sale of a portfolio of wines to E&J Gallo for $1.7 billion back in April. Three months earlier, Jameson Irish Whiskey\u2019s owner Pernod Ricard sold its Argentine brands to Chilean wine business VSPT.\n\nParis-listed Pernod Ricard may get rid of more of its global wine collection, which includes Australia\u2019s Jacob\u2019s Creek and top-selling Rioja Campo Viejo, according to Bloomberg. If that happens, Pernod will be the last of the global liquor businesses to cash out of wine almost entirely, following similar divestments at Diageo and Davide Campari-Milano in 2015 and 2017.\n\nThe latest wave of exits is the result of a sharper focus on profitability in the alcohol industry. Listed liquor companies have some of the highest stock market valuations in the consumer sector: Their shares trade for 28 times projected earnings on average, compared with roughly 24 times for those of everyday staples manufacturers like Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble .\n\nInvestors like the drinks giants for their better revenue growth: Unlike many food peers, they are on the right side of consumer trends\u2014notably demand for cocktails.\n\nIf these companies are to defend their premium valuations, though, their profitability needs more work. Pernod Ricard is under particular pressure, given that Paul Singer \u2019s activist fund Elliott Management wants it to match rival Diageo\u2019s higher operating margins. Selling its capital-intensive wine business has several potential benefits.\n\nIt would remove a drag on growth: Revenue generated from the company\u2019s key wine brands fell 5% in the 12 months through June. Although Pernod doesn\u2019t disclose profit margins for its wine business, a sale could close approximately one-third of the profitability gap compared with Diageo, according to Bernstein estimates.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What makes for a successful wine business venture? Join the conversation below.\n\nNow is a good time to sell, given that private equity is eager to soak up the dregs. Last year, buyout firm Carlyle Group bought Australia\u2019s largest wine company, Accolade Wines, and has since picked up a majority stake in a Spanish cava producer.\n\nEuropean merchant Majestic Wine was sold to U.S. private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group just a few weeks ago.\n\nWine brands are low down the list of priorities for major drinks companies and must compete for resources with more prized liquor brands. It is reasonable to think that wine will fare better under new ownership. Although some boutique wineries have gained a reputation for being more focused on agricultural production than profit, well-run wine businesses can make decent investments.\n\nBacchus Capital Management, a specialist U.S. wine investor, made an internal rate of return of 20-25%\u2014a measure of returns used in the private equity world\u2014on three wine businesses it bought and subsequently sold over the past decade.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe new owners of these wine assets will probably try to shift more inventory on the internet. Online distribution hasn\u2019t been a major focus for global drinks companies as e-commerce sales of their core liquor brands are tightly regulated in many big alcohol markets. Online wine clubs and subscription services though offer a way to cut out wholesalers and improve the category\u2019s profitability.\n\nAnd if wine is to attract younger drinkers, then the way it is marketed needs to be overhauled. Today, wine consumption is broadly flat: Global volumes could fall by 0.2% annually between now and 2023, according to alcohol-industry research body IWSR.\n\nThe wine world relies on aging baby boomers, unlike liquor and craft beer brands that have done a better job of using social media to appeal to a new generation of consumers. Some brands have shown that a similar approach can work for wine. France\u2019s Whispering Angel has used Instagram to become the one of the top-selling ros\u00e9 wines in the U.S.\n\nFine wines and champagnes are an exception to the trend. Drinks like Mo\u00ebt and Veuve Clicquot, which are controlled by French luxury company LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton , can be as profitable and recognizable as top liquor brands. Diageo, which owns a 34% stake in LVMH\u2019s spirits and wine subsidiary, would probably jump at any chance to buy its partner\u2019s share.\n\nBut more pedestrian wine brands have soured for big liquor companies. At Pernod Ricard and its peers, the clear-out of the drinks cabinet isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nWrite to Carol Ryan at carol.ryan@wsj.com", "description": "Drinks companies like Jameson Whiskey-owner Pernod Ricard and Diageo have been getting out of wine brands after struggles in the business.", "authors": ["Carol Ryan", "Carol.Ryan Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EY696_WINEHE_SOC_20190912101232.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
