Lee and Stonewall Jackson removed because they said it sends a racist message. But they were sued by residents, including the Virginia Division of Sons of Confederate Veterans, who cited a state law that protects war memorials.\n\nThe case has been in the courts for years, and last month, Virginia Circuit Court Judge Richard E. Moore disagreed that the statues were racially discriminatory and ruled against the city. Moore stated any effort to remove the Lee statue would violate a state historic preservation statute. The decision extended to the Jackson monument.\n\nHe also issued a permanent injunction preventing the city from removing the statues.\n\nAn initial decision by the city in 2017 to remove the Lee statue prompted the 'Unite the Right' rally where Heather Heyer was killed when James Alex Fields Jr drove into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nAfter her death, the statues were covered in black tarp for six months 'as a sign of respect', before residents took the city to court, and Moore ordered officials to remove them.\n\nThe death of Heather Heyer (left) during the 2017 'Unite the Right' protest prompted the removal of the Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson statues in Charlottesville and across the US. She died after James Alex Fields Jr (left, during the rally) rammed his car into protesters\n\nThe planned removal of the Lee statue prompted the Unite the Right rally in 2017. Pictured is Fields' vehicle ramming through a crowd of counter-protesters\n\nResidents had sued Charlottesville, saying the monuments of Robert E. Lee (left) and Stonewall Jackson (right) send a racist message. But last month, a judge ruled that monuments are historic and don't send a racially discriminatory message.\n\nHeyer was killed while counter-protesting the hundreds of white supremacists who showed up for the rally, which prompted the removal of both statues and other Confederate statues around the US.\n\nShe died after she was hit by avowed white supremacist, Fields, who rammed his car through a crowd.\n\nHer mother, Susan Bro, has since sued Fields, who is currently serving life sentences plus 419 years on numerous convictions.\n\nBro said she doesn\u2019t want Fields' 'blood money,' she just wants to make sure he can\u2019t profit from selling the rights to his story or publishing a memoir.\n\nThe statue of Robert E. Lee was covered in black tarp for six months as a sign of respect after Heather Heyer's death in the Unite the Right rally, but Judge Moore ordered that it be removed\n\nCity workers were also left to patrol the parks to ensure no one ripped the tarps off the statues\n\nThe states that have Confederate stats at the Capitol include, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, among others\n\nThe white nationalist rally also brought renewed attention to dozens of Confederate monuments around the country.\n\nJust days after Heyer's death House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the removal of Confederate statues from the US Capitol.\n\nAt the time, Pelosi said the statues in the Capitol should 'embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation'.\n\nEach state is allowed to place two statues in the Capitol\u2019s National Statuary Hall.\n\nThe states that have Confederate statues at the Capitol include, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia and Florida.\n\nOne a local level, several monuments have been removed from cities in Ohio, Kentucky, Florida, Montana, Wisconsin and Missouri.\n\nTwo plaques honoring a tree planted by Robert E. Lee on the grounds of St John\u2019s Episcopal Church in Brooklyn were also removed by the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island.\n\nThe attorney for the city of Charlottesville will appeal Judge Moore's decision on October 15.", "description": "Charlottesville will appeal judge's decision against removing two Confederate statues, two years after the proposed removal of Robert E.
