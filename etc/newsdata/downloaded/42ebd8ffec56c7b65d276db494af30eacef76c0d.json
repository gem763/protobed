REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe Democrats were unequivocal on impeachment in their first matchup since the launch of a congressional impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate leading rival Joe Biden.\n\nBiden, who has led the 2020 Democratic race, joined Senator Bernie Sanders in calling Trump \u201cthe most corrupt president in modern history.\u201d The former vice president defended his son Hunter\u2019s role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, which has been criticized by Trump and his supporters.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, who has surged into a virtual tie with Biden in many Democratic opinion polls, said she called for Trump\u2019s impeachment after Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings on Russia election interference.\n\nCongress did not move to impeach, she said, \u201cand look what happened: Donald Trump broke the law again.\u201d\n\nBillionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who has poured millions into an impeach-Trump fund since 2017, tipped his hat to his rivals in his first debate.\n\n\u201cEvery candidate here is more decent and coherent and patriotic than that criminal in the White House,\u201d said Steyer, the last candidate to jump into the race.\n\nWhile all candidates supported the impeachment inquiry, a number warned that could not be Democrats\u2019 only message.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about him we are losing. We need to present a new vision,\u201d said entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\n\u201cIf impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country,\u201d added Representative Tulsi Gabbard, one of the last to get on board with impeachment.\n\nA WARREN PILE-ON\n\nWarren was rewarded for pulling into first place tonight by being attacked by her fellow Democratic candidates.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor, was the first to turn on Warren after she answered a question about whether taxes would go up under the Medicare for All government healthcare plan by saying \u201ccosts\u201d would go up.\n\nThat was \u201ca yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg said, then went on to criticize Medicare for All in general.\n\nBernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, chimed in with, \u201cAs somebody who wrote the damn bill ... At the end of the day the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills.\u201d But, he added \u201cI do think it\u2019s appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.\u201d\n\nThen Amy Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, piled on, telling Warren, \u201cYou are making Republican talking points.\u201d She added: \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipedream is something that you can get done.\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the Trump campaign had put out a press release criticizing Warren\u2019s answer.
