Ambassador Zhang Jun criticized Western countries for continuing to raise the Uighur issue, and indicated the Uighur issue could also impact U.S.-China trade talks where there has been progress.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine that on the one hand, you are trying to seek to have a trade deal and on the other hand you are making use of any issues, especially human rights issues, to blame the other,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not think it\u2019s helpful for having a good solution to the issue of the trade talks.\u201d\n\nU.S. ambassador Craft, asked about the possible impact on trade talks, replied: \u201cWell I would be standing here regardless if it was China, wherever it is. Wherever there are human rights abuses, we would be here in defense of those that are suffering.\u201d\n\nBelarus, meanwhile, read a statement on behalf of 54 countries commending \u201cChina\u2019s remarkable achievements in the field of human rights\u201d and taking note \u201cthat terrorism, separatism and religious extremism has caused enormous damage to people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which has seriously infringed upon human rights, including right to life, health and development.\u201d\n\nThe clash in the General Assembly\u2019s human rights committee continued afterward at separate press briefings by the opposing sides.\n\nMore than 1 million Uighurs have been detained in camps since 2017 and criticism has grown over their interment, as well as that of other Muslims.\n\nChina\u2019s government insists the detention sites are \u201cvocational\u201d centers aimed at training and skills development. In a report earlier this year to counter criticism of internment camps and other oppressive security in the traditionally Islamic region, China said it had arrested nearly 13,000 people it described as \u201cterrorists\u201d and had broken up hundreds of \u201cterrorist gangs\u201d in Xinjiang since 2014.\n\nThe Belarus statement \u2014 whose supporters include Pakistan, Russia and Egypt \u2014 backed China\u2019s \u201ccounter-terrorism and deradicalization measures in Xinjiang, including setting up vocational education and training centers.\u201d It noted that there has not been a single \u201cterrorist attack\u201d in Xinjiang in the past three years \u201cand people there enjoy a stronger sense of happiness, fulfillment and security.\u201d\n\nThe Western statement \u2014 whose supporters include the United States., France and Germany \u2014 called on the Chinese government to respect human rights including freedom of religion in Xinjiang and throughout China, and to urgently implement the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\u2019s recommendations \u201cincluding by refraining from the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and members of other Muslim communities.\u201d It also called on China to allow U.N. rights experts \u201cunfettered, meaningful access to Xinjiang.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce, U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft and German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen then spoke to reporters.\n\nThey said no resolution on the Uighurs has been proposed for adoption by the General Assembly\u2019s human rights committee, but Pierce said: \u201cThis will not be the last we\u2019ve heard of this important issue.\u201d\n\nCraft said: \u201cThe United States condemns the detainment of over one million Uighurs and will continue to work closely with our partners to condemn the violations of human rights no matter where they occur.\u201d\n\nHeusgen said what\u2019s needed now is for U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet to be allowed \u201cunimpeded access to all the detention camps,\u201d adding that he didn\u2019t know why China won\u2019t allow unimpeded access.\n\nZhang, speaking to a group of reporters shortly after, said the government has invited Bachelet to visit China, including Xinjiang, many times, and is in contact with her office. He accused Western nations of exerting \u201cpressure over U.N. officials\u201d not to visit.\n\nZhang was also critical of Western countries continuing to raise the Uighur issue.\n\n\u201cNo country is perfect on human rights. It\u2019s natural that we have different understanding, we have differences,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Zhang said differences should be discussed and hopefully narrowed through dialogue.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s certain is that a confrontational approach leads to nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody will win through such confrontational practices.\u201d", "description": "China and the West clashed at the U.N. human rights committee Tuesday over claims that Beijing systematically oppresses ethnic minority Muslims in far...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU275_uighur_ZG_20191029223035.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
