My shaky old millennial hands, ridden with carpal tunnel from years spent at the keyboard, gnarled from pointing the finger at people I\u2019ve canceled, cannot reach for one themselves. And the teens are making me cry again.\n\nThis time, the seniors at North Farmington High School in Michigan have dressed up in costume, a long-standing \u201cprank\u201d that is allowed by school officials, while posing for their ID photos. Their ingenuity, humor, creativity, and sheer commitment is moving and precious, especially for me, a person who grew up in a time where these works of art, shared on Twitter today, would have been sent around via something called \u201celectronic mail.\u201d And for every time I think my heart has gone black, the teens make it beat again.\n\nFirst and foremost, of course, their costumes were meme-literate. Some of them were actually live re-creations of memes. In my day, we would have been dressing up as \u2026 Salad Fingers?\n\nDidn\u2019t they tell you I was a savage ? #NFID20 pic.twitter.com/MOXjNsxiJJ \u2014 Arris Jay (@daonlydoll) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cSo I crashed in my backseat for a couple hours- and I oop\u201d @JasminesMaster #NFID20 pic.twitter.com/z42XAqHA3P \u2014 Maya Kelly (@Kelly52Maya) September 12, 2019\n\nMe looking for the motivation to graduate #NFID20 pic.twitter.com/nwsMvUH0dL \u2014 Morgan Broughton (@MorganBroughto4) September 12, 2019\n\nThey referenced major pop-culture institutions and people, from long before their time.\n\n\u201cIdentity theft is not a joke Jim!
