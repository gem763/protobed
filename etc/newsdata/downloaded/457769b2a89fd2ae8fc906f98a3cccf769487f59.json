Mexicans are exempt.\n\nThe rollout has not been publicly announced, leading to complaints by attorneys that they have no access to clients and are left in the dark.\n\n\u201cThe most concerning part here is we have not received any official word from Border Patrol and it seems to be purposeful that they have not told the (non-governmental organizations) what\u2019s going on,\u201d Linda Rivas, executive director of Las Americas Advocacy Center, said in a conference call Monday with reporters.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

She learned about the pilot from an attorney who was unable to reach her two clients, both women from El Salvador with infants who crossed the border Oct. 8.\n\nAn immigration judge denied their appeals by phone meaning the judge couldn\u2019t see documents including proof of death threats they faced in El Salvador. One woman has been deported and another is waiting to be sent home.\n\nThe pilot is designed to give asylum seekers 24-hours of access to a phone in a private room before an initial asylum screening, but attorneys said the rules are unclear and that they received no notice or instructions. If asylum seekers fail the screening, they can appeal to judges in Otero, New Mexico, by phone.\n\nThe effort, if expanded, may prove to be a critical tool in the administration\u2019s efforts to enforce a ban on asylum for anyone who passes through another country before reaching the U.S. border with Mexico. The partial asylum ban, which took effect last month, appears largely aimed at Central Americans, Cubans and Africans, who have contributed to making the U.S. the world\u2019s most popular destination for asylum seekers. Mexicans and unaccompanied children are exempt from the ban.\n\nThe administration has struck agreements to send asylum seekers subject to the ban to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to have their cases heard there, but officials acknowledge those countries lack adequate infrastructure.\n\nThe asylum seekers confirmed by lawyers to be in the trial are being held at a Border Patrol station that grew from small office building to a sprawling maze of tent camps and new construction this year amid of surge of asylum seekers, many of them Central American families.\n\nThe station can hold up to 500 migrants, said Border Patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero. Brown army-style tents hastily put up in the spring have since been taken down, as apprehensions in the agency\u2019s El Paso sector have plummeted from nearly 1,000 a day in the spring to around 200.\n\nA CBP spokesman said Monday that because the detainees appear by phone, they could be in any Border Patrol facility in the El Paso sector, which includes New Mexico and West Texas.\n\nHomeland Security confirmed the existence of the pilot program on Thursday, hours after it was reported by The Washington Post , but provided few details. It called the program a joint effort with the Justice Department, which runs immigration courts, to expedite proceedings at a single location while providing protections and due process for all. The statement said it would be enforced on single men and people traveling in families who are subject to the asylum ban.\n\nCritics have relied on scarce details in news reports to pan the pilot program. U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, tweeted Sunday that it \u201ccompletely abandons due process.\u201d\n\nEl Paso was also testing grounds for the administration\u2019s widespread practice of separating families at the border as part of a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy to criminally prosecute every adult who crossed the border illegally, including those who came with their children.\n\nThe government made no public announcements about the El Paso experiment on family separations either. Levy, then-legal coordinator for Annunciation House in El Paso, said in a court filing last year that she noticed a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in clients who were separated from their children during that time, but the government didn\u2019t tell immigration attorneys until Oct. 24, 2017 that its new policy was to separate parents whose children were over 10 years old. The government didn\u2019t formally announce its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy until April 2018.\n\nMore than 5,400 children have been separated since July 2017, according to figures that the American Civil Liberties Union that it said were supplied by government attorneys.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Officials are testing a way to speed reviews of asylum claims, offering a glimpse of how the Trump administration may enforce its partial ban", "authors": ["Cedar Attanasio", "Elliot Spagat"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/texas_prompt_asylum_case_review_pilot.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
