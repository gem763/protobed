Arsenal reached five FA Cup finals between 1971 and 1980.\n\nThere were, however, raised eyebrows over their opponents \u2014 Orient.\n\nLiam Brady gets his shot away in the FA Cup semi final between Orient and Arsenal in 1978\n\nOrient, either as Clapton Orient or Leyton Orient \u2014 the Leyton prefix was dropped in 1966 \u2014 had never gone as far in the Cup and had finished the previous season 19th in the Second Division.\n\nLaurie Cunningham had been their top scorer but he left for West Bromwich Albion in 1977 and few saw that as a signal Orient would go on a major Cup run. But under the management of Jimmy Bloomfield, with experience in midfield in Tony Grealish, a developing youngster, Glenn Roeder, at the back, and a striker in the form in Peter Kitchen, Orient were off.\n\nIn knocking out First Division opposition three times, they became 'Bloomfield's Upstarts'. With Roeder playing as a sweeper, they were also known for their five-man defence.\n\nKitchen was a 26-year-old from Mexborough in Yorkshire who, by the semi-final, was 'the northerner who has become the Cockney pride and joy'.\n\nHe was academically gifted and was questioning the wisdom of swapping Doncaster Rovers for Orient when the run began. It was hardly easy along the way, Orient needing three replays.\n\nUnder manager Jimmy Bloomfield, Peter Kitchen (left) became a crucial player for Orient\n\nBloomfield had Kitchen to throw at defences and Norwich City's was the first to feel the force, although when Kitchen scored in a 1-1 draw at Brisbane Road in front of 15,000 in the third round in January '78, the assumption was that top-flight Norwich would win the replay at Carrow Road. Instead, Kitchen scored again and that was the only goal.\n\nNext came divisional rivals Blackburn at home. It was 3-1, two more for Kitchen and one for Joe Mayo. The fifth round brought a home draw again \u2014 against Chelsea. With Peter Bonetti, Micky Droy and Ray Wilkins in the team and 25,000 at Brisbane Road, it finished 0-0. The game was held up due to trouble on the terraces and the two boards rowed over who was responsible.\n\nIn the replay, Orient's first trip to Stamford Bridge that season, an own goal by Bill Roffey gave Chelsea the lead.\n\nKitchen then scored two \u2014 his 23rd and 24th goals of the season \u2014 and as Orient celebrated with Kitchen photographed smoking a giant cigar in the bath, Chelsea held an inquest as to why Kenny Swain was dropped for turning up late.\n\nDeveloping young star Glenn Roeder was one of Bloomfield's 'upstarts' as they became known\n\nThe sixth-round draw brought more First Division opposition: Middlesbrough away. Boro were eighth in the league at Christmas, then sold Graeme Souness to Liverpool and were 15th when Orient arrived at Ayresome Park. The 34,000 locals still expected a home win. Orient's defensive organisation brought a goalless draw.\n\nThree days later, Kitchen scored twice in the first half of the replay and although David Armstrong pulled one back for Boro, little Orient had reached an FA Cup semi-final.\n\nAt Highbury, eventual winners Ipswich took on West Brom \u2014 where Cunningham replaced a bloodied John Wile. At Stamford Bridge, Orient were back to face an Arsenal side orchestrated by the brilliant Liam Brady.\n\nThe focus was on the upstarts, of course. Orient's finances could be gauged by their request that Arsenal's squad co-sign 40 footballs to be auctioned for the Orient players' pool. Arsenal declined, Orient were not happy. Kit manufacturers Admiral stepped in with a donation. It was on the basis that Orient wore Admiral gear, part of a 'Buy British' campaign in a time of Adidas dominance.\n\nArsenal manager Terry Neill had been one of 7,000 at Brisbane Road to see Orient's goalless draw with Blackburn in the league four days before.\n\nThe Gunners did not want to go the same way as Norwich, Chelsea and Boro. In front of a 50,000 crowd \u2014 Stamford Bridge's capacity then was 60,000 \u2014 two early goals from Malcolm Macdonald ensured they did not. Graham Rix added an individual third in the second half. Not even Kitchen could reply.\n\nOne report referred to 'Arsenal's stylish, aggressive total superiority which, in the end, made the match the most one-sided semi-final for years'. On this occasion, Orient's tactics could not cope with Brady and, perhaps harshly, Kitchen said afterwards: 'Playing five men in defence... it didn't work. We didn't play at all.'\n\nThe following week Orient lost at Crystal Palace and relegation to the Third Division loomed. But Bloomfield's men found form and on the season's final day won 1-0 at Cardiff to reach 38 points. They were one of seven clubs to finish on that total, one point above relegation. An escape to follow an escapade.\n\nOrient's goal at Ninian Park was scored by... Peter Kitchen.", "description": "MICHAEL WALKER: Few thought Orient would go on a major Cup run in 1978.
