Perlmutter", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) said that he believes impeachment proceedings should \u201cmove forward\u201d now \u2014 a move he was previously reluctant to support\n\n\u201cI've been one that's been reluctant to do more than investigate,\u201d the congressman told Yahoo Finance. \u201cI wanted to see the facts. You know, we've heard about hush money to girlfriends. We've been worried about money from foreign governments being used to pay for hotel rooms at Trump hotels.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this one's different,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis one involves people's lives. Lives are directly at stake. National security is at stake. And I think it's so important for us to move forward now, because this just really flies in the face of pretty much everything I think America stands for.\u201d\n\nThe Congressman spoke to Yahoo Finance as Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee. Committee members grilled the DNI, pressing him for information on why he withheld the whistleblower complaint that the Inspector General deemed \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe memo that was released yesterday was incriminating enough that the president was trying to force Ukraine to do his bidding politically,\u201d Perlmutter said. \u201cAnd then to get the information in the complaint that it looks like they were trying to hide it away, cover it up, it's just more damning, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that they want to lock it away in a national security file so that nobody sees it or can't have access to it\u2014 that is very troubling,\u201d the congressman continued.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., addresses reporters at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019.

Scott Applewhite) More\n\nIn her announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) alleged that Maguire had violated the law when he withheld the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cThe law is unequivocal,\u201d Pelosi said in her statement. \u201cThe D.N.I. staff \u2014 the D.N.I., director of national intelligence \u2014 shall provide Congress the full whistle-blower complaint.\u201d\n\nRep. Perlmutter agreed with Pelosi.\n\n\u201cWell, I think the statute is very clear,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe whistleblower complaint from the Inspector General was given within 14 days to the DNI. He had, it said-- and in seven days, he shall turn it over to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. And because the White House told him not to, he didn't. I mean, the law couldn't be clearer.\u201d\n\nThe complaint was eventually released on Thursday morning.\n\nIn her announcement of an inquiry, Pelosi instructed all six House committees to submit information that could be used as part of an impeachment case. The House Financial Services committee established an Oversight and Investigation subcommittee solely dedicated to investigating President Trump\u2019s ties to Deutsche Bank, according to a committee aide.\n\nBut Perlmutter says subpoenaed documents haven\u2019t yet been provided to the committee.\n\n\u201cSo we've been asking for the bank records from Deutsche Bank since the March of 2017,\u201d the congressman explained. \u201cWhen Democrats took the majority in January, we asked again. Deutsche Bank was prepared to turn over the bank records. Trump Organization objected, went to court. The district court said, turn over the records. Trump Organization appealed it. And now we're up on appeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe documents really haven't been turned over yet. And the question is, will they show money coming from Russia to one or more Trump organizations? We just don't know, because we don't have the documents yet.\u201d\n\nKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
