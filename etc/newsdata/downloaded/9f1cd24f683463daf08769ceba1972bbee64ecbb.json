Reuters was not immediately able to contact the directors of Lakshmi Vilas Bank or RFL for comment. It was unclear how many directors were under investigation.\n\nThe police investigation is occurring as the domestic banking sector has been roiled by defaults from housing finance companies and the central bank has taken charge of a leading co-operative lender this week.\n\nIndia\u2019s banks are also grappling with roughly $150 billion in stressed assets and the country\u2019s non-banking finance companies are struggling with liquidity pressures.\n\nLakshmi Vilas said earlier this year it would merge operations with housing finance firm Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IBHF) in a share-swap deal.\n\nIndiabulls did not immediately respond to a request for comment on potential implications for the merger.\n\nOne source at Lakshmi Vilas, who asked to remain anonymous, said the merger would not be affected by the investigation.\n\n\u201cRFL had first raised the issue in May 2018 and the merger talks started well after that. As a result they are aware about it and it shouldn\u2019t derail the talks,\u201d the source said.\n\nIBHF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares were trading 3% lower on Friday.", "description": "Indian police have opened a probe into the directors of Lakshmi Vilas Bank after a customer accused them of misappropriating funds, the bank said late on Thursday.", "authors": ["Nupur Anand", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
