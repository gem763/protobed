The doctor placed a small structure in each patient's blood vessel to open it up, which allowed blood to flow through, according to the report.\n\nThe authors noted that this operation was \"successful in all aspects\" for the five patients and that none of them experienced procedural complications.\n\nWhile surgeons have used robots in operations since 2001, the success of these surgeries could be a step forward for the treatment of heart disease. Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally, according to the World Health Organization.", "description": "The authors noted that this operation was \"successful in all aspects\" for the five patients and that none of them experienced procedural complications.", "authors": ["Stella Soon"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106154990-1569818588251gettyimages-53352429.jpeg?v=1569818685"}
