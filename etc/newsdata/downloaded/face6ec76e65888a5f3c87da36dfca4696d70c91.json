The researchers examined 34,000 English citizens randomly sampled from across England's local-authority districts\n\nBut the new research, by professors Nattavudh Powdthavee and Andrew Oswald, is some of the first to confirm the same in humans.\n\nThe researchers examined 34,000 English citizens randomly sampled from across England's local-authority districts.\n\nEveryone in the study was asked to remember 10 words in a standardised word-recall test.\n\nThe analysis adjusted for a large number of other influences on the quality of people's memory -- including people's age, health, level of education, ethnicity, and family and employment status.\n\nThe report, revealed a strong link between air pollution and impaired memory, and is to be published in the journal Ecological Economics.\n\nAlthough memory slowly worsens as most people grow older the authors estimate that those in those living in England's most-polluted have the equivalent of 10 extra years of ageing on their clean air inhabiting counterparts.\n\nProfessor Andrew Oswald said: 'When it comes to remembering a string of words, a 50 year old in polluted Chelsea performs like a 60 year old in Plymouth.\n\n'We are still not exactly sure how nitrogen dioxide and air particulates act to do this'.\n\nThe traditional British seaside resort of Weston super mare in Somerset (stock)\n\nThe most polluted air in England is in places like Kensington and Islington.\n\nThe cleanest is on the west coastline in districts like Devon and West Somerset.\n\nProfessor Powdthavee said: 'There is a little prior evidence of a negative association between levels of traffic pollution and memory using data on elderly individuals and in children.\n\n'But almost all research in human studies on this topic has been based on elementary correlations and not on nationally representative samples of individuals in a country. We have tried to solve these two problems in our study.'\n\nUsing a nationally representative sample the researchers have been able to study the link between data on a standardised word-recall test that was done in the year 2011 by 34,000 randomly sampled English citizens.\n\nThey then collated this with data on NO2 and PM10 across 318 geographical areas.\n\nThe paper does not focus on the extreme loss of memory that is a characteristic of dementia-like conditions.", "description": "Researchers from the University of Warwick found that human memory is significantly worse in areas with high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and air particulates (PM10).", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/16/19748722-0-image-a-20_1571154603119.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
