'They blocked this money and nobody asked us [for] anything.'\n\n'The President of the Ukraine just stated again, in the strongest of language, that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong,' Trump posted in a second tweet Thursday morning. 'He used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat Scam, but it won't, because the Dems & Media are FIXED!'\n\nDemocrats claim the president issued a quid pro quo when he ordered the U.S. to withhold millions in military aid just a week ahead of his July 25 phone call with Zelesnky where he urged the Ukrainian president to investigate political rival Joe Biden.\n\nDonald Trump claimed in two tweets Thursday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's insistence that there was no quid pro quo should end the impeachment inquiry\n\nWhile speaking at an all-day press marathon at a foot market in Kiev, Ukraine on Thursday, Zelensky said, 'There was no blackmail. They blocked this money and nobody asked us [for] anything'\n\nA whistle-blower's complaint, revealing in September the questionable nature of the phone call, launched a flurry of new allegations against the president and led to the House launching a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nShortly after the conversation was made public last month, Zelesnky claimed at the time that he did not feel pressured by Trump.\n\nZelensky said Thursday that he only learned after their discussion in July that the U.S. had blocked hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to the country.\n\nTrump, who has called his conversation with Zelensky 'perfect,' has been accused of withholding funds to Ukraine unless authorities in the country helped dig up dirt on his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nHunter accepted a position with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings in 2014, while his father was still vice president.\n\nIn an all-day 'media marathon' held in a food court, Zelensky played down suggestions that Trump pressured him to investigate his Democratic rival in exchange for military aid to help Ukraine battle Russian-backed separatists.\n\nWhen responding to questions, the Ukrainian president said, 'We didn't speak about this,' in reference to the military aid freeze.\n\nTrump asked Zelensky during the call to 'look into' Biden and his son, according to a rough White House transcript.\n\nCongressional Democrats believe Trump was holding up the military aid to use as leverage to pressure Ukraine and advance his domestic political interests before next year's U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe July call is central to the impeachment inquiry, and embarrassed Zelensky because it showed him as eager to please Trump and critical of European partners whose support he needs to strengthen Ukraine's economy and to end the conflict with Russia.\n\nHe said he 'didn't even check' whether the Ukrainian transcript of the July call is the same as that of the White House, but says 'I think they match.'\n\nCongress launched an impeachment inquiry, claiming Trump set a quid pro quo of military aid to Ukraine in exchange for Zelensky digging up dirt on Joe Biden. Zelensky told reporters (pictured) that the call 'wasn't linked to weapons'\n\nTrump later said the military aid was frozen because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine, but the move prompted congressional outcry and the money was released in September.\n\nBut Zelensky said the call 'wasn't linked to weapons or the story with Burisma.'\n\nAsked what Ukraine did to persuade the U.S. to release the aid, Zelenskiy said: 'We have many diplomatic contacts. And in case we need to find a solution to questions of this level, questions about our country's security, we use all our powerful possibilities.'\n\nHe didn't elaborate.\n\n'I don't want to interfere in any way in the elections' in the U.S., he said. Zelensky appears to be playing to both US political camps to ensure Ukraine has continued support no matter who wins the presidential election next year.\n\nZelensky said he thought the call would lead to an in-person meeting with Trump, and wanted the American leader to come to Ukraine.\n\nZelensky said the 'key question' for him was to try to persuade the White House to 'change its rhetoric' about Ukraine as a corrupt and untrustworthy country.\n\nHe said he wanted to meet with Trump in person but that there were 'no conditions' set for such a meeting.\n\nHe said he had 'several calls' with Trump, but bristled at repeated questions about their relationship. 'We are an independent country, we have relations with many countries,' not just the US, he said.\n\nA TV and film comedian, Zelensky overwhelmingly won the presidency in April on promises to fight corruption and end the five-year conflict with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy claimed there was 'no blackmail' during his phone call with President Trump in July\n\nJoe Biden's son, Hunter (right), took a board position with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings in 2014 \u2013 while his father was still serving as vice preident\n\nHe's treading carefully to ensure continued support from the U.S. while trying to make peace with powerful neighbor Russia.\n\nMost of the questions at Thursday's unusual media event related to the Russia conflict or Ukraine's economic troubles.\n\nIn the July call, Trump sought help on two fronts. The first involves Trump's claims that Ukraine allied with the Democrats in a plot to derail his 2016 presidential campaign. No evidence of such a plot has emerged.\n\nAt the same time, Trump is also pushing Ukraine to investigate any potential wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nTrump has said the United States has an 'absolute right' to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases, though no one has produced evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the former US vice president or his son.\n\nZelensky also joked about Trump's Twitter missives, saying he doesn't expect a change in US..-Ukrainian relations in the future, 'but if there is, we'll learn about it on Twitter.'", "description": "Donald Trump asserted Thursday that his Ukrainian counterpart's comments should immediately put an end to House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19542506-0-image-a-5_1570716621518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
