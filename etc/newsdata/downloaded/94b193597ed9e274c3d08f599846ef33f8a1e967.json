Arizonans for Official English, the en banc Ninth Circuit rules, by a 6 to 5 vote, that Article XXVIII violated the First Amendment rights of a former state employee\u2014and awards her one dollar in nominal damages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudge Reinhardt writes not only the majority opinion but also a concurring opinion that attacks dissenting Judge Kozinski, who reads settled law as establishing that \u201cgovernment employees have no personal stake in what they say in the course of employment because that speech is the government\u2019s, not theirs.\u201d Showing his contempt for the citizenry, Reinhardt puffs about the \u201ctrue horror [that] could happen if Judge Kozinki\u2019s view prevailed\u201d: \u201cGovernment employees could be compelled to parrot racist and sexist slogans, to hurl hateful invective at non-English speaking people asking for assistance, to publicly declare their loyalty to political parties, and to bow toward the national or state capitol three times a day.\u201d Only in Reinhardt\u2019s fevered mind are there budding majorities clamoring for such measures.\n\nUnfortunately for Reinhardt, he gets carried away in more ways than one, as the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of his ruling in 1997 (in Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona) shows. In her unanimous opinion for the Court, Justice Ginsburg severely scolds Reinhardt and the Ninth Circuit: \u201cThe Ninth Circuit had no warrant to proceed as it did. The case had lost the essential elements of a justiciable controversy [when the plaintiff left state employment in April 1990] and should not have been retained for adjudication on the merits by the Court of Appeals.\u201d Reinhardt\u2019s theory that the plaintiff had a live claim for nominal damages against Arizona was defective in two respects, Ginsburg explains. First, the cause of action under which the plaintiff sued creates no remedy against a state. Second, in an earlier order in the case, Reinhardt had barred Arizona from further participation in the case as a party and permitted it only the status of an intervenor. Ginsburg notes this \u201clapse\u201d in Reinhardt\u2019s reasoning: \u201cThe Ninth Circuit did not explain how it arrived at the conclusion that an intervenor the court had designated a nonparty could be subject, nonetheless, to an obligation to pay damages.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn light of disputes over the meaning of Article XXVIII, Ginsburg also faults the Ninth Circuit for failing to use the certification process to obtain the Arizona supreme court\u2019s authoritative reading of the provision. Noting that the Ninth Circuit \u201chad superintended the case since 1990,\u201d Ginsburg observes: \u201cIn litigation generally, and in constitutional litigation most prominently, courts in the United States characteristically pause to ask: Is this conflict really necessary?\u201d Any such attention to limitations on the exercise of judicial power is clearly not characteristic of Reinhardt.", "description": "1989\u2014By a vote of 4 to 3, the Florida supreme court rules (in In re TW) that a state statute that requires parental consent for a minor\u2019s abortion (subject to a judicial-bypass exception) violates the state constitutional right to ...", "authors": ["Ed Whelan", "Andrew C.
