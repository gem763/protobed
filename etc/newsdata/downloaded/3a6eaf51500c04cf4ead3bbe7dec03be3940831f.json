Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine for information he could use against political rivals are at the center of the House impeachment inquiry. Officials said Putin and Orban did not encourage Trump to seek such information on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Twitter, the Hungarian government\u2019s international spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, called the reported details of Orban\u2019s interactions with Trump \u201ctypical of the fake news factory.\u201d\n\nBut apart from Putin\u2019s widely known animosity toward Ukraine, Orban would also have had a clear motive in helping to sour Trump on the country.\n\nZelensky has tried to position himself as a pro-Western reformer, whereas Orban likes to portray himself as a counterweight to Western liberalism. His critics view him as a right-wing populist who has pushed Hungarian democracy to its limits.\n\nStill, experts cautioned that Orban\u2019s remarks to Trump on Ukraine were unlikely to be predominantly rooted in ideological differences with Zelensky.\n\nAD\n\nOrban\u2019s efforts came shortly after Zelensky\u2019s election victory and before he took office \u2014 at a time when Orban and his allies in fact appeared to approve of Zelensky. They considered the new president a more pragmatic leader than his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, said Andras Racz, a researcher with the German Council on Foreign Relations who focuses on the region.\n\nAD\n\nKovacs appeared to confirm that view Tuesday. \u201cThe previous, Porosenko administration pursued expressly anti-Hungarian policies,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Kovacs added: \u201cThe new administration of President Zelensky offers new hope for better policies and more positive relations.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Orban\u2019s criticism of Ukraine at the time was more likely rooted in a long-running historical dispute, said researcher Racz.\n\nAD\n\nSince the end of communism in Hungary in 1989, the foreign policy of successive Hungarian governments has consistently emphasized providing support to ethnic Hungarian minorities living abroad.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, when the Austro-Hungarian Empire found itself on the losing side, Hungary lost two-thirds of its territory. To this day, some Hungarians consider the territorial changes to have been unjust. The postwar changes meant that Hungary\u2019s ethnic diaspora was spread out across what today constitutes Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine, among other countries.\n\nAD\n\nWhereas previous Hungarian governments provided support to those communities, the intensity of such efforts massively gained momentum when Orban became prime minister in 2010 for a second time. Under his government, Hungary has handed out passports to hundreds of thousands of Hungarian minority members abroad.\n\nAD\n\nThe motivation to do so, said Racz, was predominantly domestic, as Hungarian passport holders can vote in national Hungarian elections. \u201cEthnic minorities are generally more nationalistic, more conservative,\u201d he said, and have in effect strengthened Orban\u2019s right-wing ruling party, Fidesz.\n\nBut in Ukraine, those efforts were met with a backlash from the government in Kyiv. Unlike in Romania and Serbia, where dual citizenship is legal, Ukraine does not allow its citizens to hold a second passport from another country.\n\nAD\n\nFrom Kyiv\u2019s perspective, Hungarian minority members\u2019 efforts to circumvent that rule and vote in Hungarian elections have been perceived as a provocation.\n\nAD\n\nFrom the perspective of the Hungarian government, however, the blame lies with Kyiv, which has allegedly failed to integrate its Hungarian-speaking minority for decades.\n\nFew members of the community \u2014 concentrated at the edge of Ukraine\u2019s west and accounting for less than 0.5 percent of Ukraine\u2019s total population \u2014 speak Ukrainian. Many of them work in Hungary and reside in Ukraine only over the weekends. In an indication for how far removed many of those residents feel from the Ukrainian capital, some have set their clocks to Budapest time, which is one hour behind Kyiv\u2019s.\n\nOrban\u2019s allies regularly accuse the Ukrainian government of neglecting the Hungarian-speaking minority, which has become a serious source of frustration and contention between the two countries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKovacs tweeted Tuesday: \u201cA strong, stable and democratic Ukraine is in Hungary\u2019s interest because it would not only have a positive impact on relations between the two countries but also on the ethnic Hungarian community in Transcarpathia.\u201d Kovacs was referring to the part of western Ukraine where the Hungarian minority predominantly lives.\n\nIn a parallel development, Orban\u2019s government has also intensified its relations with Putin, whose forces illegally annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in 2014. Putin has also backed a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Putin\u2019s and Orban\u2019s efforts to get Trump to adopt a hostile view of Ukraine were coordinated and how far they went. But both leaders\u2019 shared animosity toward Ukraine has hardly come as a surprise to experts in the region.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A small diaspora community in Ukraine's southwest could offer clues to the Hungarian leader's thinking.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mC7DspSZFkzET82uJIEACQ4hjd0=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/05-14-2019/t_72519ab2cb0e4c4daedf651feec9cf8b_name_DL6KAITVWEI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
