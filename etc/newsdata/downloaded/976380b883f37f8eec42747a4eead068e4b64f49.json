Listen to what he has to say about betting on Week 5. USA TODAY\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will be without their leading sack artist for at least a month. Clay Matthews suffered a broken jaw on Thursday night against the Seattle Seahawks and will be out for an extended period of time.\n\nSean McVay said Friday it'll sideline Matthews for at least a month. It's a significant blow for the Rams, who aren't exactly deep at outside linebacker.\n\nThe Rams think Matthews was hurt when Seahawks running back Chris Carson inadvertently kicked the linebacker in the face. Matthews was also hit with another crucial and controversial \"roughing the passer\" penalty on Russell Wilson in Thursday night's loss.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy, but it was a physical game,\u201d McVay said. \u201cIt was something that you just hate for him because of how productive he\u2019s been for us and what he\u2019s meant to our team and all the things that he\u2019s done. It\u2019s going to be a big loss. Guys are going to be asked to step up in his absence.\u201d\n\nMatthews leads the team in sacks with six, which is 2.5 more than he had all of last season.\n\nSean McVay on Clay Matthews' injury: \"That\u2019s not good for us. That\u2019s a big injury.\" Matthews got kicked in the jaw as he tried to tackle Seahawks' Chris Carson near the end of the game. \u2014 Kevin Modesti (@KevinModesti) October 4, 2019\n\nMatthews wasn\u2019t playing every snap, but he was a key contributor when called upon. He was sharing time with Samson Ebukam outside.\n\nThe Rams signed Matthews to a two-year deal this offseason.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "description": "Clay Matthews suffered a broken jaw in the Rams' Thursday night loss to the Seahawks and will be out at least a month.", "authors": ["Cameron Dasilva", "Rams Wire", "Published P.M.
