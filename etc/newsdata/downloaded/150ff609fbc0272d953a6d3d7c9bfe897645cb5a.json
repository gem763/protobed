And Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate, did just that with her plans for Social Security.\n\nJust to remind you about Social Security\u2019s finances, the program\u2019s actuaries project a deficit over the next 75 years of 2.78% of taxable payrolls. As shown in the figure below, this deficit reflects the combination of rising costs and constant levels of income. The increasing costs are the result of a slow-growing labor force and the retirement of baby boomers, which raises the ratio of retirees to workers. Social Security\u2019s deficit can be eliminated either by bringing up the income rate or lowering the cost rate in the figure below.\n\nRead: Social Security is pretty great, but here\u2019s something that could improve it\n\nUntil now, the debate appeared to have been bookended by competing visions of the former and current chairmen of the House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee \u2014 Sam Johnson (R-Texas) and John Larson (D-Conn.). The Social Security 2100 Act, proposed in 2019 by Larson and others retains benefits and substantially increases the income rate. That is, it brings the income rate to the cost rate. The other vision espoused by Johnson in 2016 would sharply cut benefits and thereby lower the cost rate to match the income rate. Both proposals have been evaluated by the Social Security actuaries and would restore balance over the next 75 years.\n\nWarren places most of her emphasis on expanding benefits, including a $200-per-month increase for all recipients, a more generous index for cost-of-living adjustments, and a new caregiver credit.\n\nHer plan also includes several other benefit-enhancing provisions. In addition, the proposal provides more administrative funding to do things like hire staff and keep offices open. These costs are more than offset with new revenue from a 14.8-percentage-point payroll tax on earnings above $250,000 and a 14.8% tax on investment income on the top 2% of earners \u2014 the latter change is accompanied by a broadening of the investment tax base.\n\nRead: 7 Social Security myths that aren\u2019t true, no matter how often you hear them\n\nWarren\u2019s plan has not been \u201cscored\u201d by the Social Security actuaries, but one estimate is that it would extend the life of the Social Security trust fund by about 20 years \u2014 far short of restoring 75-year solvency.\n\nWith the Warren proposal on the table, the goal of restoring solvency while maintaining current benefits seems very modest indeed.", "description": "The presidential hopeful\u2019s plan makes protecting current benefit levels seem like a modest goal.", "authors": ["Alicia H.
