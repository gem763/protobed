REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\n(Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) said on Wednesday it had received marketing authorisation from China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration for its top-selling drug, Tagrisso, to treat adults with a form of lung cancer.\n\nChina approved Tagrisso as a first-line treatment for adults with non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumours have certain genetic mutations, AstraZeneca said.\n\nLast month, the British drugmaker said a late-stage study showed Tagrisso had significantly helped patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer live longer.\n\nThe company has moved deeper into cancer therapy through wide-ranging deals, including those for immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Earlier this year, it agreed to a multi-billion dollar oncology deal with Japan\u2019s Daiichi Sankyo Co (4568.T).\n\nSales from AstraZeneca\u2019s oncology unit soared 57% to $2.17 billion in the second quarter, accounting for 38% of total product sales, with revenue from Tagrisso nearly doubling to $784 million.\n\nAstraZeneca had also raised its product sales forecast for 2019, thanks in part to strong sales of cancer drugs.\n\n(This story corrects to show study in August points to overall survival and not progression free survival in paragraph three)", "description": "AstraZeneca Plc said on Wednesday it had received marketing authorisation from China's National Medical Products Administration for its top-selling drug, Tagrisso, to treat adults with a form of lung cancer.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426045857&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830ID"}
