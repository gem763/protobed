Biden\u2019s son Hunter now includes his joint venture with a Chinese government entity to buy a U.S. automotive technology company with potential military applications.\n\nThe ease with which the 2015 transaction was approved by the Obama administration alarmed Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who is looking into whether the Obama-Biden White House intervened in the process.\n\nOne of the companies in the 2015 deal was Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), a billion-dollar investment fund backed by China that was formed by Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz, the stepson of then-Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s Aviation Industry Corporation of China teamed with BHR to buy Henniges Automotive, a producer of high-tech, anti-vibration components for automobiles.\n\n\u201cThe direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,\u201d Mr. Grassley wrote in an Aug. 15 letter to Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.\n\nMr. Grassley, Iowa Republican, requested Mr. Mnuchin provide committee investigators with documents from the approval process, including a copy of the National Threat Assessment required for the deal.\n\nThe purchase of Henniges by the Chinese needed approval from the Obama administration\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that included a go-ahead from Mr. Kerry\u2019s State Department.\n\nThe $600 million acquisition of Henniges gave the Chinese aviation firm a 51% stake in the business and direct control of the anti-vibration technology. BHR got a 49% share of the business.\n\n\u201cThe appearance of potential conflicts in this case is particularly troubling given Mr. Biden\u2019s and Mr. Heinz\u2019s history of investing in and collaborating with Chinese companies, including at least one posing significant national security concerns,\u201d Mr. Grassley wrote.\n\nHe balked that CFIUS approved the transaction despite reports that in 2007, the same Chinese aviation company was reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data about the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s Joint Strike Fighter program.\n\nChina reportedly incorporated the stolen data into its J-20 and J-31 stealth fighter aircraft.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s free-wheeling business ventures at home and abroad are becoming a headache for his father\u2019s campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe Biden campaign refused to participate in this report.\n\n\n\nThe younger Mr. Biden, a Yale-educated lawyer who has been in the tabloids more for his drug use and romantic escapades than for his business savvy, has made a fortune in a series of deals that often appear greased by his father\u2019s political clout.\n\nIn 2013, the elder Mr. Biden and his son flew aboard Air Force Two to Beijing. Within weeks, Hunter Biden\u2019s firm inked a $1 billion private equity deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government\u2019s Bank of China and BHR was born, according to Peter Schweizer\u2019s book \u201cSecret Empires.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden and Mr. Heinz\u2019s investment firm Rosemont Seneca, formed in 2009 when the elder Mr. Biden was sworn in as vice president, was at the center of a series of multibillion-dollar deals with companies owned by the Chinese government. They also enlisted the Massachusetts-based consulting firm Thornton Group run by James Bulger, nephew of notorious mob hitman James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger, Mr. Schweizer revealed.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s business lucky streak spanned the globe.\n\nHis high-paying post on the board of a Ukraine natural gas company \u2014 a job he fell into in 2014 when his vice president dad was spearheading the Obama White House\u2019s efforts in the country \u2014 also is at the center of House Democrats\u2019 reinvigorated effort to impeach President Trump.\n\nA U.S. intelligence community whistleblower accused Mr. Trump of abusing his Oval Office power by asking the Ukrainian president to investigate corruption by Mr. Biden and his son there.\n\nMr. Trump has insisted that the corruption is from Mr. Biden, who is a top contender for the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Biden as the vice president visited Kyiv and threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country\u2019s leaders fired Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor.\n\nHe said the prosecutor failed to fight corruption. But the prosecutor also was investigating Ukraine gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a $50,000-a-month job on the board.\n\nThe elder Mr. Biden said his actions had nothing to do with his son and the two of them never discussed business deals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing anybody in my family did wrong \u2014 at all,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
