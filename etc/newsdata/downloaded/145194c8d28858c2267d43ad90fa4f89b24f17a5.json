That is a familiar New York feeling. What is not a familiar New York feeling is being smiled at by the people you bump into. Instead of being huffed at or passive-aggressively rammed with a shopping cart, I kept hearing, \u201cafter you,\u201d or \u201cpardon me,\u201d or even \u201cGood morning!\u201d It was disconcerting \u2014 like being in a Home Depot, but jam-packed with fresh food and friendly people.\n\nI had heard about the emotional connection people have to Wegmans, but I had never seen it up close. I can report that it is a real thing. \u201cOh my God, grew up in Syracuse, a Wegmans addict,\u201d were the first words out of Lynn Schmidt\u2019s mouth, as though she was too excited to speak in complete sentences. Today Ms. Schmidt lives in New York City. \u201cBut every time we go back to Syracuse, it\u2019s all about Wegmans,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one compares. We\u2019ve been waiting for decades in New York to have a Wegmans.\u201d\n\nIn the face of enthusiasm like this, the skeptical reporter in me is on high alert. But I will admit that the sheer size and positive energy inside the store was impressive, as were its alarmingly wide aisles. And it\u2019s one of the company\u2019s smaller operations.\n\nSo what explains this level of passion for a grocery store? Some of it is the natural loyalty that attaches to a family-owned business, which Wegmans has been for more than a century. Some of it is the fact that Wegmans predated the current trend of massive, well-stocked, high-quality supermarkets. But what struck me most in the end was not the range or quality of the food options \u2014 after all, I can find the same at Whole Foods or other similar modern emporiums, albeit for more money. It was the sense of community, of shopping for food as reaffirmation of a shared civic life in which everyone looks out for one another. This sense seems to exist between the owners and the staff (Wegmans consistently ranks as one of the best workplaces in the country), and between the staff and customers. One woman told me that shopping at Wegmans reminded her of the way a line of cars pulls to the side of the road to let the ambulance go by.\n\nIn this communal aspect as well as in its size, Wegmans felt a bit like the Grand Central Terminal of grocery stores, a huge yet welcoming space that people have an almost daily need to visit, and where everyone is on equal footing, at least for that moment.", "description": "Now that the supermarket has moved to Brooklyn, I know why people have been awed by my last name.", "authors": ["Jesse Wegman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/opinion/29wegman-1-print/29wegman-1-print-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
