Players have noticed that one of Mirage\u2019s loading screens, which you can earn with the free battle pass, has some flavour text on it that contains a recipe.\n\nScreenshot: Apex Legends, Respawn\n\nThe pork chop recipe involves making a glaze of dijon mustard, honey, maple syrup, cinnamon, and cloves, along with salt, pepper, and cayenne for the chops. Honestly, it sounds pretty nasty to me. I don\u2019t eat meat anymore, but based on 28 years of prior experience, I\u2019m concerned about how sweet the sauce seems. To wit, a player who claims to have made this recipe described it as tasting like \u201cmeat candy.\u201d\n\nThe mods of the Apex Legends subreddit have posted an updated version of the recipe which they say comes straight from Manny Hagopian, a writer for Apex Legends at developer Respawn. Although it adds optional pineapple juice (?) and makes the recipe even sweeter by suggesting you sprinkle the chops with brown sugar, Apex players seem generally more satisfied with this version, and have been making it and posting their results.\n\nI love Mirage with all of my heart, but I suspect that despite how lovely some of these pork chops look, they taste like arse. One player said that they were the best pork chops they\u2019ve ever tasted, though they also say they put in way less cinnamon and cloves than the recipe called for, as did another player. Probably a good call, as cloves can be extremely overpowering.\n\nI actually have most of the ingredients for the glaze, so I might make it and try it on some hearty roast vegetables and tempeh. Sometimes I still think about my own family\u2019s heirloom recipe for pork chops, from my dad\u2019s side.\n\nHere\u2019s how he does it: create a mixture of salt, pepper and a little flour, lightly coat your pork chop in that, sear \u2018em, then stick them in the oven at 190 degrees Celsius for around ten minutes. It\u2019s all you need.", "description": "Apex Legends players have uncovered a new secret in the game\u2019s lore: a family recipe for Mirage\u2019s pork chops....", "authors": ["Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wdkuzbnmnwqtx6jjrupz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
