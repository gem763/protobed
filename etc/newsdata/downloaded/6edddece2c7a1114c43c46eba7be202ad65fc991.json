It's his thing, and I've learned to ignore it over the years. About 90 percent of the time, his complaints eventually resolve themselves, i.e. the person quits, the weather changes, a flight gets rebooked, etc. Maybe not when he wants, but eventually.\n\nRight now, he's in a tizzy about our kid's summer camp. I'm not pleased either, but I see no harm in letting things go until summer is over. But he wants us to \"explore other options.\" Okay fine.\n\nBut he also lobbed a well-worn criticism: that I don't listen to him or take his concerns seriously.\n\nWell, no, I don't, because most of the time what he's upset over is so minor, can't be changed or resolves itself. Give me something I can do about it, and I'll be a happy participant! He complains so often that I can't register complaints of my own because if I did, that's all our marriage would be.\n\nDo I need to start being faux-concerned over his complaints? What I really want is to tell him to grow up!\n\n\u2014 Faux-Concerned\n\nFaux-Concerned: Well, now I\u2019m complaining, because in your last line you took my advice away.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean that I planned to say your husband needs to grow up. Though it\u2019s possible he does.\n\nWhat I mean is that I had advice for you, but it depended on your being generally okay with your husband\u2019s complainey coping technique \u2014 and your parting shot says you\u2019re not.\n\nSo now we need to address a bigger problem, that your husband is under chronic stress \u2014 possibly anxious? \u2014 and his way of dealing with it is not working for you. I also doubt it\u2019s working for him.\n\nThat\u2019s beyond a faux-geddaboudit approach. Talk to him, at a time you choose carefully, with no current stress flare-ups and when you don\u2019t have anywhere you need to be. Explain to him you\u2019ve just gone along assuming he was the pessimist and you were the optimist and you balanced each other out, but maybe you were wrong not to see if he was okay with this, too? Is he okay with having this role delegated to him, or does he want help with feeling less anxious?\n\nAnd say you were wrong to let him think you just weren\u2019t listening or taking him seriously, when the truth is you\u2019ve been insulating yourself, because you\u2019re not comfortable contesting everything that goes wrong.\n\nThen you listen, listen, listen. With a mind open to his perspective on this and on you.\n\nIf you come to a warm acceptance of each other\u2019s roles, and your own, then you can skip to the advice I was planning to give, that you just be overt about your arrangement. Warmly, not facetiously: \u201cHave you got this, or do you need me to worry, too?\u201d Or: \u201cI am listening. Is there something you need from me?\u201d Then you weigh what he suggests, case by case.\n\nIf you remain at odds about each other\u2019s roles or perceptions of them, or if the weight of his negativity is more than you can carry, then professional counseling would make sense.\n\nEither way, I hope you can persuade your husband to ask his doctor about anxiety. Maybe stress doesn\u2019t have to be \u201chis thing.\u201d", "description": "How do you react to his constant complaining?
