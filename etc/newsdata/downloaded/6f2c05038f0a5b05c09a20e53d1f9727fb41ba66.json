More than 300,000 students will have missed eight days of school on Monday due to the strike, which is now entering its third week.\n\nIn a press conference Sunday, Lightfoot and CPS CEO Janice Jackson said the city had reached a tentative agreement with SEIU Local 73, the union representing 7,500 school support staff that have been striking alongside CTU for the city to meet their demands. School support staff include bus aides, special education aides, custodial workers and security officers.\n\nLIVE FROM PRESS BRIEFING ROOM: Mayor Lightfoot and Dr. Janice Jackson join with members of the press to provide updates on contract negotiations with Chicago Teachers Union.https://t.co/NJhNd81ho9 \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 28, 2019\n\nThe tentative agreement with SEIU reportedly includes a 16% pay increase; more dollars an hour extra for bus aides, security and custodians after a certain number of years; more input from bus aides on routes; and better working conditions for special education aides, according to Chalkbeat Chicago.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for working people in Chicago and shows what is possible when we unite and take action,\u201d SEIU Local 73 President Dian Palmer said in a statement. \u201cThe lowest paid support workers who are the backbone of our schools are going to see raises that mean their families won\u2019t have to struggle living in an expensive city where costs keep going up.\u201d\n\nThe support staff union\u2019s bargaining team still needs to review and finalize the deal before the contract would end the strike. Palmer said that SEIU will be \u201con picket lines in solidarity\u201d with CTU on Monday.\n\nAt her press conference, Lightfoot expressed visible frustration that CTU won\u2019t agree to her proposals. The mayor said she offered average teacher pay rising to $100,000 over the contract\u2019s duration; no health insurance increases for three years; a full-time nurse and social worker in every school; and compromises on the large class sizes that teachers have been dealing with.\n\n\u201cThis is by any estimation an incredible offer. Despite all of this, the CTU has not accepted it,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cWe are enormously disappointed that CTU simply cannot take yes for an answer.\u201d\n\nCTU responded to Lightfoot\u2019s complaints on Twitter, stressing that it took Jackson 10 months and a strike to come to the bargaining table, and alleging that the mayor is pretending there isn\u2019t enough money to fund the union\u2019s demands. The union has asked for smaller classes sizes, better pay and benefits, fully staffed support systems and restorative justice programs for students.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just cut through the spin from City Hall and get to it: The money our schools need is there. The mayor isn\u2019t bailing out CPS. She\u2019s raiding her CPS piggy bank to avoid taxing the wealthy donors who put her in office,\u201d the union tweeted.\n\nLet\u2019s just cut through the spin from City Hall and get to it: The money our schools need is there.

The union said that there\u2019s a $38 million total in cost difference between its proposals and the district\u2019s proposals, which it said amounts to about half of 1% of the annual CPS budget.\n\nThe city has pushed back against the notion that the cost difference is $38 million, alleging the union is asking for closer to $100 million in changes.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s shifting nearly $100 million out of the Chicago Public Schools budget \u2015 money that should go to students and classrooms \u2015 and using it to plug the budget hole for the city,\u201d CTU tweeted, citing the $60 million in a pension cost shift and the $33 million increase for the police department cited in Lightfoot\u2019s new city budget proposal.\n\n\u201cA fraction of 1 percent of the annual CPS budget stands between us and an agreement. A number of demands would cost the district virtually nothing,\u201d the union continued. \u201cAt this point, everyone is suffering but the person who could actually make a difference: the mayor.\u201d\n\nCTU got a positive boost of national spotlight over the weekend when Chicago native Chance the Rapper sported a CTU sweatshirt while hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The rapper said he fully supports the teachers union in their negotiations and mentioned that he donated $1 million last year to Chicago\u2019s public schools.\n\nHere's @chancetherapper on the @CTULocal1 strike: \"Honestly to the teachers in Chicago, I know you are on strike right now. I fully support you. I just wish when I was in school my teachers had gone on strike.\" pic.twitter.com/os9M8gTqtW \u2014 Nader Issa (@NaderDIssa) October 27, 2019", "description": "The standoff between Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the Chicago Teachers Union has resulted in an eighth day of striking, the city's longest in over 30 years.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db652762100002838ad40f7.jpeg?cache=2yjqbxtsdb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
