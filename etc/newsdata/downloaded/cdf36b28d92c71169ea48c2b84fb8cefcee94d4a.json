It\u2019s one that means a lot to us. I can see her now looking out the window of the car tapping along to it. There are a lot of songs that mean a lot to us.\n\n\"I\u2019m not treating it like a singing competition, I\u2019m doing it as a tribute for Tanya.\"\n\nIt is understood he has been rehearsing Everybody Needs Somebody To Love for the opening show, but may perform more tearjerking tracks later in the series.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve got a song that I could get emotional to, but Tanya wouldn\u2019t want me to crack up. It\u2019s a ballad, an Irish song, it\u2019s basically about me and her. So it\u2019s a sad song.\n\n\"If I can get through that, I think that could bring the house down.\n\n\"The biggest part of doing X Factor was Tanya. She loved the show, she thought it would be brilliant. I\u2019m like, \u2018No no, really?\u2019 She was like \u2018yeah you\u2019ll be brilliant, I love it,\u2019 then my daughter jumped in, Kaley, and she\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to do it.\n\n\"It gave Tanya something to look forward to, to come over to London and get well for.\n\n\"Sadly it was a bridge too far for her.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nFormer footballer Vinnie, who won the FA Cup with Wimbledon, insisted he was not nervous about singing live.\n\nHe said: \"I\u2019ve played in front of 100,000 fans in my football days, I got through that. I won that one. I\u2019ll be excited to get stuck in and see where it takes me.\u201d\n\nHe has vowed to give any X Factor winnings to the hospitals that cared for his late wife, Harefield hospital and Cedars Sinai.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nAsked to describe his vocals he added: \"My sound\u2019s a bit gravelly. I\u2019m best if I\u2019m a bit gravelly. I sing some nice Irish ballads. And cowboy songs I love.\n\n\"But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to go in a competition like this. I think you\u2019ve got to come out loud, maybe a bit of Madness, Baggy Trousers, all that kind of stuff. I mean, that\u2019s what everyone expects from me.\u201d\n\n*The X Factor: Celebrity airs Saturda on ITV at 8.20pm", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Vinnie Jones admits he could get emotional when he makes his debut on The X Factor: Celebrity debut this weekend", "authors": ["Mark Jefferies", "Image", "Getty", "Itv", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715873.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Vinnie-and-Tanya-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
