But instead, the 18-year-old star has been forced off Twitter by vile trolls who are attacking her over comments made by her male co-star. Fair? Definitely not. A sign of the times? Absolutely.\n\nRachel\u2019s real-life fairytale \u2013 plucked from relative obscurity to play the role of Maria in Steven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story remake \u2013 is in danger of turning into a nightmare, when all she should be worrying about right now is what she\u2019s going to do when the myriad of job offers start rolling in.\n\nLast weekend, Rachel\u2019s co-star Ansel Elgort, 25, announced in an interview that he wants to be \u2018open\u2019 to falling in love with people other than his longterm girlfriend, Violetta Komyshan, and so-called stans of Anseletta decided this was entirely Rachel\u2019s fault because she has posted some complimentary tweets about her co-star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter filming wrapped on September 27, Rachel shared a sweet message about playing one-half of the star-crossed couple opposite Ansel, writing: \u2018There really aren\u2019t enough words to describe the pride I have in Ansel\u2018s growth and beauty and literal magic he possesses on screen and off. Falling in love with him was easy. Happy wrap mi amor; catch ya on a fire escape sometime soon.\u2019\n\nThe cast of West Side Story (Picture: @amblin/ METROGRAB)\n\nHowever, when Ansel gave his interview, some idiotic fans wrongly decided the relationship has moved from professional to personal and took to social media to harass the teenager. Rachel has been called a \u2018homewrecker\u2019, received hateful DMs and been slated on Twitter and Instagram, even though Ansel\u2019s comments had nothing to do with her. Although Ansel has not spoken out, it\u2019s doubtful he received the same level of abuse.\n\nAnnouncing her (hopefully temporary) social media break, Rachel said: \u2018The fact that i have to say something is absolutely absurd. but the DMs and the name-calling and throwing around the word homewrecker over me expressing genuine love i have for my coworker is heartbreaking and i don\u2019t want any part of it. So peace for now, i guess. be nice.\n\n\u2018The internet has made me upset so goodbye for a bit be nice to each other.\u2019\n\nEven if Rachel does return to Twitter, this magical once-in-a-lifetime experience has undoubtedly been soured because she has been held accountable for her male co-star\u2019s comments. And, sadly, it\u2019s likely that this experience will leave her much more guarded in future, with an end to the charming, candid tweets of the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel\u2019s experience is just one example of women being held to account for the actions of men and it needs to stop. Admittedly, the situations are vastly different but recently Taylor Swift was asked about Harvey Weinstein during promotions for her latest album Lover.\n\nThe now-disgraced movie producer asked Taylor to write a song for the 2013 romcom One Chance, she had a supporting role in his 2014 movie The Giver, and Weinstein attended the launch party for her 2014 album 1989. This appears to be the extent of their relationship but five years after they last worked together, Taylor is still being asked about him. And the ensuing headlines, such as \u2018Taylor Swift breaks her silence on Harvey Weinstein allegations\u2019, \u2018Taylor Swift Opens Up About Working With Harvey Weinstein\u2019 and \u2018Taylor Swift Downplays Association With Harvey Weinstein\u2019, threatened to overshadow her own promotion cycle.\n\nRachel Zegler seen on location for West Side Story in Washington Heights (Picture: James Devaney/GC Images)\n\nCompare this to Quentin Tarantino, who admitted in 2017 that he knew about instances of sexual assault allegedly committed by Harvey for decades but didn\u2019t act on the information. He worked with Harvey for years, knew about some of his alleged crimes, yet managed to get through a whole recent promotional tour for Once Upon A Time in Hollywood with nary a mention of Weinstein? Something doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolding people to account for their wrongdoings is the right thing to do. Taking women to task for the words and actions of their male colleagues is unfair, dangerous and downright ridiculous. If Ansel Elgort wants to get involved in an open relationship, that\u2019s his business and nothing to do with his teenage co-star. Attacking Rachel will do nothing except force her off social media indefinitely, depriving the world of her sweet and silly musings and leaving us all infinitely worse off.\n\nMORE: Who is Quentin Tarantino\u2019s wife Daniella Pick as they announce pregnancy?\n\nMORE: Who is Quentin Tarantino\u2019s wife Daniella Pick as they announce pregnancy?", "description": "Rachel Zegler shouldn't be bullied off social media for the comments of Ansel Elgort.", "authors": ["Colette Fahy"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88544778_1570299373.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
