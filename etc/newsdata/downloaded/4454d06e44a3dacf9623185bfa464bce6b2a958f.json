PioRoda/CNN) More\n\nButtigieg and Warren shine at LGBTQ forum\n\nOver a span of five hours on Thursday night, nine Democratic candidates \u2014 Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 appeared at a CNN town hall focused on LGBTQ issues.\n\nAhead of the event, Buttigieg and Warren released comprehensive plans for LGBTQ equality. But it was their performances onstage that drew raves.\n\nLast month, Buttigieg, the first openly gay candidate to mount a credible run for a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, spoke about coming out for the first time on a national debate stage. On Thursday night, the South Bend, Ind., mayor described growing up knowing he was gay but refusing to accept it.\n\n\u201cIt was like a civil war, because I knew I was different long before I was ready to say that I was gay and long before I was able to acknowledge that that was something that I didn\u2019t have power over,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI think you spend so much time as you grow up learning the things that you can control or trying to control things, and there are some things that you don\u2019t. Learning to accept that, and let alone learning that it didn\u2019t have to be a bad thing, that took me a long time.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, a U.S. military veteran, decided to come out after returning home from Afghanistan, in 2015, during his reelection campaign for mayor. He was reelected with 80 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cI so admire people who are coming out at young ages, but also recognize that there\u2019s no right age or right way or right time to come out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are ready when they\u2019re ready. And for me, I was well into my 20s before I was really ready to say even to myself that I was gay.\u201d\n\nWarren delivered the night\u2019s most viral moment when asked how she would respond to an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d supporter who believes that marriage is \u201cbetween one man and one woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that. And I will say, \u2018Well, then, just marry one woman,\u2019\u201d Warren said, adding: \u201cAssuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nThe room erupted into applause.\n\nElizabeth Warren was asked how she would respond to a person who says that marriage is \"between one man and one woman\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that, and I will say, then just marry one woman. \u2026 Assuming you can find one,\" Warren said. #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/RAuVqch7Ls \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 11, 2019\n\nBiden, who was the first Obama administration official to publicly support same-sex marriage, recalled President Barack Obama's reaction after he unexpectedly made the announcement in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d", "description": "The Commission on Presidential Debates on Friday announced the sites and dates for three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate during the 2020 general election.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Christopher Wilson", "Senior Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JOZYdBBSDTbzTyHekO1nmw--~B/aD0yMTYwO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/706d6d40-ec4c-11e9-afff-8f91ecb03bb0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
