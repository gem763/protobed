It\u2019s voted the city\u2019s Best breakfast and brunch cafe by the AOK guide, so bring a healthy appetite: portions are reassuringly hearty.\n\nFrom here, walk to Christiansborg Palace (visitcopenhagen.com), seat of the Danish government. Its 350ft tower is Copenhagen\u2019s highest, free to ascend and offers great views over the city. Back at ground level, a combined ticket (\u00a319) gives access to The Royal Reception Rooms, with their impressive tapestries, as well as The Royal Kitchen, The Ruins, The Royal Stables and The Palace Chapel.\n\nThere\u2019s a smattering of museums in the vicinity, including the National Museum of Denmark, St Nikolaj Contemporary Art Centre, The Royal Danish Arsenal Museum and the Thorvaldsens Museum \u2013 but not to be missed is The Black Diamond, home to The Royal Library \u2013 a bibliophile\u2019s heaven within and a design lover\u2019s dream without, with black glass that mirrors water and sky.\n\nKnown for its bike culture, Copenhagen\u2019s flatness is also ideal for sightseeing on foot, so hug the edge of the island to cross the canal at Stormbroen and head for two of the city\u2019s oldest streets. Magstr\u00e6de and Snaregade, divided by Knabrostr\u00e6de, are a delight of cobbles and coloured facades \u2013 some date from the 18th Century. Grab a pizza at Gorm\u2019s (gormspizza.dk) to keep you going without breaking for lunch.\n\nAfternoon\n\nThe statue of writer Hans Christian Andersen\n\nContinue on to City Hall, fronted by a square over which a statue of Hans Christian Andersen presides. Guided tours in English are held daily from Monday to Saturday, but even from the outside, the building is a testament to Denmark\u2019s grand past.\n\nIt\u2019s a short wander from here to Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (glyptoteket.com), a vast building, complete with glass-domed conservatory and a series of summer concerts, which houses an impressive collection of Danish and French art.\n\nMake a quick detour to chug a beer at the evocative dive bar, Spunk, then head to the Tivoli Gardens, a wonderland of twinkling lights and plinking carousel music as dusk falls. Dating from 1843, this is Europe\u2019s oldest amusement park.\n\nEnd the day at one of the hipster-magnet Meatpacking District\u2019s eateries \u2013 like Pat\u00e9 Pat\u00e9, where continental flavours and wines are served up alongside shabby wooden furniture, vintage posters and bare lightbulbs, and then move on to one of the neighbourhood\u2019s vibrant bars for a nightcap.\n\nDay two\n\nMorning\n\nLocal colour: Set out early to miss the crowds at Nyhavn, a canal lined with colourful houses\n\nSet out early to miss the crowds at Nyhavn: by 10am, those sherbet-coloured facades, so beautifully reflected in the canal waters, are a mass of selfie sticks and #influencers. Hans Christian Andersen lived, variously, in three of these charming houses and Restaurant Fyrt\u00f8jet (The Tinderbox) is named after one of his most famous tales (fyrtojet.dk): head here for an epic brunch plate of meats and cheeses before heading around to the Little Mermaid Statue \u2013 again, before the crowds descend \u2013 sculpted by Edvard Eriksen. Many are disappointed with her size, but there\u2019s something touchingly pensive about her posture.\n\nSlow your pace on the way back to admire the Opera House, across the water, and the sparkling cleanliness of the canals which, in warm weather, attract swimmers.\n\nCrossing the water at Inderhavnsbroen will bring you to Christiania: known as the most bohemian neighbourhood, thanks to its connection with cannabis. It\u2019s now a car-free relaxing place to wander, while sampling bakery treats and vegan and vegetarian foods.\n\nAfternoon\n\nRide north-west to the N\u00f8rrebro neighbourhood, one of the city\u2019s hippest. In the Assistens Cemetery, final resting place of Hans Christian Andersen, you\u2019ll find locals jogging and lazing; and the graves of Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and painter Christen K\u00f8bke.\n\nFrom here, head to cobbled J\u00e6gersborggade: almost every store has an eco-angle, from jumbled antiques and vintage clothing, to L\u00f8es Market, the city\u2019s first zero-waste supermarket, and Istid, where organic ingredients combine with liquid nitrogen to create dreamy ice-cream confections.\n\nA city so dissected by canals deserves waterside time, even if you haven\u2019t taken a hop-on, hop-off boat tour. Reffen (reffen.dk) is a food market in the old docks where bites are served with a side order of sustainability. Grab some blue corn tacos, Danish pork stew or South Indian dosas, pull up a deckchair by a fire pit and end the day by washing down the sunset with a craft beer or cocktail.", "description": "Sarah Rodrigues provides tips on the things to do on a city break in Copenhagen.
