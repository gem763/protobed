The privilege of being on the living end of racism. The privilege of a political response when death from drug overdoses comes in bunches.\n\nWhite privileges are the relative advantages racism affords to people identified as white, whether white people recognize them or deny them. To be white is to be afforded one\u2019s individuality. Afforded the presumption of innocence. Afforded the assumption of intelligence. Afforded empathy when crying or raging. Afforded disproportionate amounts of policymaking power. Afforded opportunity from a white network. Afforded wealth-building homes and resource-rich schools. Afforded the ability to vote quickly and easily.\n\nThose who are impoverished and white do not, on average, have to live in areas as densely poor as the impoverished black people down the way. To be armed and white is to be unthreatening.\n\nAs I mourned my way to the train station, I was not thinking about white privileges, though. Black death subsumed me from the Cummings family, to Atatiana Jefferson\u2019s family, to my own. Perhaps we should think less about what racism affords people and more about what it deprives them of?\n\nThe inverse of white privilege is black deprivation. Scholars from the sociologist Robert Staples to the historian Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor have used the term to highlight the relative effects of racist policies and ideas on black people. Racism degrades, dispossesses, deprives. Black individuals are deprived of their individuality. Deprived of the presumption of innocence. Deprived of the assumption of intelligence. Deprived of empathy when crying or raging. Deprived of proportionate amounts of policymaking power. Deprived of the white networks where opportunities are exchanged. Deprived of wealth-building homes and resource-rich public schools. Deprived of shorter voting lines during major elections.\n\nThose who are impoverished and black do not live, on average in areas as income-diverse as the impoverished white people down the way. To be unarmed and black is to be threatening.\n\nBut there may be no more consequential black deprivation than life itself.\n\nIbram X. Kendi: The hopefulness and hopelessness of 1619\n\nThe night before I learned of Cummings\u2019 death, I hung out with Dad, just the two of us, for the first time in a long time. Dad and a family friend had come to my speaking event at Princeton University. In talking to Ma about his visit days prior, she happily expressed how consistently he had been walking, how he was planning to return to his personal trainer at the month\u2019s end. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said for probably the fifth time, \u201cthat personal trainer saved his life.\u201d Like many black families, we were not expecting our Dad to live.\n\nIn Cummings\u2019s home of Baltimore, a white baby born in Cheswolde can expect to live until age 87. Nine miles away, in Clifton-Berea, near where The Wire was filmed, a black baby can expect to live until age 67. In Philadelphia, black men live 69 years, five years less than the average of other men, and 10 years less than the average of other women. In Kansas City, a black man can expect his life to end 20 years earlier than a white woman living 10 minutes away. In Chicago, a white resident in Streeterville can expect to live until 90, while a black resident nine miles south in Englewood can expect to live until 60. The 30-year gap in Chicago is the largest in the nation followed by 27.5 years in Washington, D.C.; 27.4 in New York City; and 25.8 years in New Orleans and Buffalo, New York. In all, 56 of America\u2019s 500 largest cities have sizeable life-expectancy gaps between segregated neighborhoods, a recent study found.", "description": "Like so many black men in America, Elijah Cummings died too young.", "authors": ["Ibram X.
