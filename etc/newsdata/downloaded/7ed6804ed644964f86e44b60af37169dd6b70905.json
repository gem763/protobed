It\u2019s a sign of things to come tomorrow as a southerly wind transports warmer and slightly more humid air into the region.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: With winds turning to come from the south, humidity is headed slowly upward. This won\u2019t amount to much other than warmer overnight lows. They range from the upper 50s to mid-60s under mostly clear skies. Winds are out of the south about 5 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday): It\u2019s another day with plenty of sun. You may notice more of that rising humidity as dew points enter the 60s, which is on the low side of moderate. Temperatures generally head for the mid-80s, but some upper 80s to near 90 may mix in, especially around the city. Clouds bubble a bit in the afternoon, and a few showers or a rumble are possible, although the main activity should be south of here. Winds are from the south and southwest about 10 mph.\n\nSee Dan Stillman\u2019s forecast through the weekend.
