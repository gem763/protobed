This \u201cKissinger model\u201d may better suit Trump\u2019s management style than the formula known as a \u201cteam of rivals.\u201d\n\nFriends and acquaintances of the president\u2019s often tell me he\u2019s a good listener who likes to hear many points of view before making important decisions. But public comments after Bolton\u2019s ouster show otherwise: While Trump appreciates some expert advice, he\u2019s quite impatient with too many bickering adults in one room.\n\nWhich brings us to Bolton and Pompeo, who, before serving Trump, took very similar foreign policy positions. Both were averse to rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea. Both advocated principled, muscular American foreign policy while recognizing global realities and their limitations. And, yes, both advocated replacing tyrannies that threaten America and our allies with more benign regimes.\n\nThen, as Pompeo emerged from the CIA shadows to become secretary of state, he quickly grasped Trump\u2019s aversion to the words \u201cregime change.\u201d As top diplomat he adopted, instead, the president\u2019s favorite model \u2014 economic \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to force regimes to change behavior.\n\nIn internal cabinet consultations, Bolton \u2014 a nuclear-disarmament official in the George W. Bush era \u2014 apparently wasn\u2019t as pliant.\n\nPublicly trashing his ousted adviser Wednesday, the president zeroed in on Bolton\u2019s \u201cLibya model\u201d \u2014 words that raised Pyongyang\u2019s ire in 2018. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Kim Jong-un,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe wanted nothing to do with John Bolton.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s offending words had nothing to do with the Obama-era ouster killing of Moammar Khadafy in 2011 \u2014 a nightmarish example of regime change gone awry. In fact, they concerned Libya\u2019s 2003 decision to decommission its nascent nuclear program and let international and American inspectors oversee and inspect it.\n\nBut when Bolton made this \u201cmodel\u201d clear in television interviews on the eve of the Trump-Kim Singapore summit, all Kim heard was regime change \u2014 a concept Bolton never disavowed.\n\nPompeo, by contrast, pointedly said he\u2019s \u201cnot for regime change\u201d during his April 2018 Senate confirmation as secretary of state. It may have sharply deviated from his past as one of the most foreign policy hawkish members of Congress, but it was enough for senators \u2014 and apparently for Trump, too.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Pompeo confirmed that a no-preconditions meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations later this month is in the offing.\n\nBolton reportedly fiercely pushed against such a powwow. Old Pompeo would have agreed with him, but now he recognizes Trump\u2019s eagerness to put his deal-making prowess on display, so why not meet an odious adversary.\n\nBut wait, no preconditions?\n\nWhile Trump limits his demands of Iran to no nukes, Pompeo is yet to rescind his often-bandied list of 12-point demands. Those include an end to Iran\u2019s presence in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon, its support for terrorists and hostility toward Israel \u2014 and, gasp, dismantling the Quds Force, the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 ideology and terror-exporting arm.\n\nSuch demands amount to, well, if not regime change, at least a call on the Khomeinist regime to shed core ideology and its reason for being.\n\nWithout a voice advocating toughness, Trump may give away too much as he makes deals with tyrants. But he may have trouble handling a cacophony of too many voices, so he can do worse than concentrating all advice in the hands of one foreign policy hawk. For now, and until his signature \u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d Trump seems to like and get along well with Pompeo.\n\nThe Kissinger model could work.\n\nTwitter: @BennyAvni", "description": "Soon after President Trump said he\u2019d announce his pick to replace John Bolton as national security adviser this week, Washington was abuzz: How about Mike...", "authors": ["Benny Avni", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/pompeo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
