It was wrenchingly familiar for many who only a few years ago had fled the militants of the Islamic State group.\n\nThe Turkish invasion was launched three days after U.S. President Donald Trump opened the way by pulling American troops from their positions near the border alongside their Kurdish allies. At a time when Trump faces an impeachment inquiry, the move drew swift criticism from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, along with many national defense experts, who say it has endangered not only the Kurds and regional stability but U.S. credibility as well. The Syrian Kurdish militia was the only U.S. ally in the campaign that brought down the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nTrump warned Turkey for moderation during its assault and safeguard civilians. But the opening barrage showed little sign of holding back: The Turkish Defense Military said its jets and artillery had struck 181 targets so far. More than a dozen columns of heavy black smoke rose above one border town.\n\nA Kurdish-led group and Syrian activists said that despite the bombardment, Turkish troops had not made much progress on several fronts they had opened. But their claims could not be independently verified, and the situation was difficult to assess.\n\nA photo taken from Turkey's Sanliurfa province, on Oct. 9, 2019 shows smoke rises at the site of Ras al-Ayn city of Syria as Turkish troops along with the Syrian National Army begin Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria against PKK/YPG, Daesh terrorists.

He did not elaborate, and reports from the area did not indicate anything remotely close to such a large number of casualties.\n\nErdogan also warned the European Union not to call Ankara's incursion into Syria an \"invasion.\" He threatened, as he has in the past, to \"open the gates\" and let Syrian refugees flood into Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kurdish forces halted all operations against IS in order to focus on fighting Turkish troops, Kurdish and U.S. officials said.\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish fighters, along with U.S. troops, have been involved in mopping-up operations against IS fighters still holed up in the desert after their territorial hold was toppled earlier this year.\n\nAnkara considers members of the Kurdish militia to be \"terrorists\" because of their links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has led an insurgency against Turkey for 35 years. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people. The U.S. and other Western countries also consider the PKK a terrorist group.\n\nTurkey considers its operations against the Kurdish militia in Syria a matter of its own survival, and it also insists it won't tolerate the virtual self-rule that the Kurds succeeded in carving out in northern Syria along the border.\n\nThe Turkish assault aims to carve out a corridor of control along the length of the border \u2014 a so-called \"safe zone\" \u2014 clearing out the Kurdish militia. Such a zone would end the Kurds' autonomy in the area and put much of their population under Turkish control. Ankara has said it aims to settle 2 million Syrian refugees, who are mainly Arabs, in the zone.\n\nTurkish military aircraft is seen at the Incirlik 10th Tanker Base Command in Saricam district, in Adana as Turkish troops along with the Syrian National Army begin Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria against PKK/YPG, Daesh terrorists, across Akcapinar district of Sanliurfa, Turkey on Oct. 9, 2019.
