Trump compromised our security for his gain.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why it matters that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine while he was requesting political favors from its new president, think about the Ukrainian soldiers who are fighting a nasty proxy war against Russian-backed separatists.\n\nThe United States is Ukraine\u2019s ally in this fight. Ukrainian commanders, battling to hold their country together against a five-year onslaught by Russia, have been depending on U.S. promises of military assistance. In life-or-death situations like this, America\u2019s word is its bond. But suddenly, in mid-July, American commitments seemed to Ukrainians to have become Trump\u2019s political tool.\n\nWhy is this more than just another Trump vs. Democrats mud fight? Because the Ukraine issue is about compromising U.S. national security \u2014 and direct pledges to allies \u2014 for the president\u2019s personal political gain. That\u2019s what\u2019s so outrageous about Trump\u2019s alleged push to get dirt on his potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden, in a July 25 phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Not for the first time, Trump was putting himself above his country.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t even bothering to deny the basics. He confirmed Tuesday that he had held up delivery of a promised $391 million in military aid for the Ukrainians in mid-July, before his call to Zelensky. Trump claimed he wanted to pressure \u201cEurope and other nations to contribute to Ukraine.\u201d Trump had suggested Sunday that in the July call he had urged Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son\u2019s work for a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nForget the political jousting between Trump and Biden, and consider the Ukrainian soldier in the field fighting to save his country. He has a nightmare communications problem because he can\u2019t talk reliably with his commanders. Russia has been hacking or jamming Ukrainian military communications since it seized Crimea and began supporting the separatists in 2014.\n\nThe United States wanted to help fix this battlefield communications disaster. One item in the $391 million package Congress appropriated is a secure system made by L3 Technologies, a unit of Harris Corp., that could allow the Ukrainians to maintain contact despite Russian interference. The L3 equipment was ready for delivery in July when the company was told no, there was a hold, the equipment couldn\u2019t be shipped, according to a congressional source.\n\nL3 and other companies supplying Ukraine contacted leading Republican members of Congress, such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) to find out why there was a delay. The members of Congress made inquiries and learned that the Office of Management and Budget had stopped the shipments, on orders of the White House, to conduct \u201cdue diligence\u201d about corruption and the newly elected Zelensky, according to one knowledgeable source.\n\nBut Graham warned the White House: \u201cYou can\u2019t send a signal that we\u2019re going to back out of the deal,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do \u2018due diligence\u2019 and another that we\u2019re changing our posture.\u201d These national security arguments eventually prevailed, and the Ukraine assistance was finally released on Sept. 11.\n\nTrump\u2019s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are. One legislator who worried about the holdup of L3\u2019s communications package was Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.), a former Air Force officer who represents a state where L3 has some of its plants.\n\nHoulahan told me Monday: \u201cI\u2019m alarmed about reports that the provision of military equipment \u2014 which Ukraine needs, which Congress supported \u2014 was stopped, inexplicably, and then started up again, inexplicably. . . . Ukraine, an ally of ours, is under stress fighting Russian proxies. The idea that this happened with very little reasonable explanation is worrisome.\u201d An L3 spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nPeople who regard this latest Trump affair as just more political noise should examine an op-ed published online Monday by seven freshman Democrats who served in Iraq, Afghanistan or other military deployments. These aren\u2019t reflexive Trump bashers. They\u2019re mostly from swing districts where impeachment isn\u2019t very popular, but the Ukraine case pushed them to recommend that radical step.\n\nHere\u2019s what Houlahan and the six other national-security veterans wrote in The Post: Trump \u201callegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain.\u201d\n\nThe former military and intelligence officers saw Trump\u2019s actions as a potential violation of his oath of office, requiring urgent investigation, and they\u2019re right. This isn\u2019t just another partisan fight. It goes to the essential obligations of a commander in chief.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "Trump witholding Ukraine\u2019s military aid is especially troubling.", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs", "September At Pm", "David Ignatius Writes A Twice-A-Week Foreign Affairs Column."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/s8zdiHrVgrAabmpdghfZDsfsJtc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3NWELXW7B4I6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
