Rescue may take another 12 hours,\" Tamil Nadu Relief Commissioner, Dr Radhakrishnan told local media reporters on Monday.\n\n\"Forty feet more to be drilled and then a passage needs to be cut. The child is in a stable condition and is being monitored via camera,\" he added.\n\nThe depth of the well is disputed, with some claiming it to be 600 feet, while others suggesting it may be as deep as 1,000 feet.\n\nOn the occasion of Hindu celebration of Diwali, former Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted that he was praying for Wilson to be reunited with his \"distraught parents at the earliest\".\n\nWhile the nation celebrates Deepavali, in Tamil Nadu a race against time is underway to save baby Surjeeth, who has been trapped in a borewell since Friday. I pray that he will be rescued & reunited with his distraught parents at the earliest \ud83d\ude4f#savesurjeeth \u2014 Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) October 27, 2019\n\nIn the past few years, cases of children falling in open wells have been recorded across India.\n\nIllegal drilling to extract water in areas where groundwater is depleting has often been cited for the presence of these wells.\n\nIn June, a two-year-old child died after he fell in a borewell for nearly 110 hours in Sangrur, Punjab.", "description": "Two-year-old Sujith Wilson fell into the well while playing with friends on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/7e8ecebaf1044bd681751d5d866ff45e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
