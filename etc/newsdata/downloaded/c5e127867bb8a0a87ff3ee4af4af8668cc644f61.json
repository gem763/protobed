Relative to a country\u2019s population however, the US still beat China. Individuals and households featuring in the top 10% have to be worth at least $100,000.\n\nGiven China\u2019s population size, the figures do not paint an accurate picture though. In the U.S. about 30% of the population were featured among the world\u2019s top 10% while for China it was just 7% of its population. Based on the World Bank\u2019s population figures, China has a population of 1.39 billion while the US has a population of 327 million.\n\nUS still beating China in churning out millionaires\n\nMore Chinese entered the top 10% bracket but the US still beat China with regards to minting millionaires. The number of new US millionaires created in the last one year per mid-2019 estimates was 675,000. This brought the total to 18.6 million, or about one millionaire for every 17 Americans. The rest of the world, including China, added 425,000 millionaires. Currently, China boasts of 4.4 million millionaires, or about one millionaire for every 315 Chinese.\n\nThe trade tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies have also not prevented them from leading the rest of the world in wealth creation. The US contributed $3.8 trillion in wealth creation while China contributed $1.9 trillion. Wealth per adult in the US went up by $11,980.\n\nWhat about the rest of the world?\n\nGlobal wealth rose by 2.6% to $360 trillion. In the next half a decade, global wealth is expected to rise by 27% to $459 trillion. During the same period, the number of global millionaires is expected to grow to nearly 63 million. Currently the number of millionaires stands at 46.8 million.\n\nWhile the US and China added millionaires, some parts of the world recorded a decline. Australia for instance recorded a decline of 124,000 and this was primarily attributed to currency fluctuations. Other countries that saw the number of millionaires decline included UK and Turkey which lost 27,000 and 24,000 millionaires respectively.\n\nGlobal household wealth increased at the highest rate in India (5.2%) and South America (4.9%).\n\nEurope and the Asia-Pacific region recorded the lowest levels of global household wealth growth \u2013 1.2% and 1.3% respectively.", "description": "China now outnumbers the US in the race for the largest number of citizens featuring in the world's richest top 10% for the first time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chinese-tourist-NTB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
