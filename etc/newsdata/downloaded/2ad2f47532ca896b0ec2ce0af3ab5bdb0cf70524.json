Nine senior parliamentarians took pot shots at the controversial parliamentary gatekeeper as they too part in a special hustings ahead of an election for the role. Mr Bercow, who has infuriated Brexiteers over his interventionist policy over Brexit, and been at the heart of a bullying controversy, is to step down at the end of the month after a decade in the chair. Tory MP Shailesh Vara said he believed Mr Bercow had 'tarnished the role of Speaker with his biasness' over Brexit and described him as a 'verbal playground bully'. Mr Vara said Mr Bercow 'loses all authority to lecture to MPs as to how they should behave when his own behaviour is in question'. He added: 'So I think that the speaker should always be courteous and polite, authoritative yes, but not demeaning to his colleagues.' The election of the next Commons Speaker will take place on November 4, after Mr Bercow - who has held the office since 2009 - takes the chair for the final time on October 31. The candidates were asked if they thought Mr Bercow 'behaved well' back at the time of the initial prorogation period, and whether they would have handled it any differently. The now-overturned prorogation saw farcical scenes in the Commons chamber in the early hours of the morning Labour former minister Chris Bryant said he hated the 'chaos in the chamber', adding: 'I didn't think that did us any favours. I thought it was crazy that we were doing it at 2 o'clock in the morning or whatever it was.' Tory Sir Henry Bellingham added: 'I think the Speaker rose to the occasion in his own way but I think he shouldn't have shown disbelief.' Labour's Harriet Harman, the longest serving female MP said: 'I think the public were appalled by what they saw on television and I completely agree with them.' Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the favourite to replace Mr Bercow, said: 'We have to get the public to put their trust back in Parliament.' He added: 'We don't need to be a bear pit.'\n\nThe Speaker is meant to be an impartial referee of debates, but Mr Bercow has repeatedly been 'creative' with the rules to frustrate the government - saying his duty was to champion MPs against the executive.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit plans were thwarted partly as a result of his intervention, and last month a rebel law was passed ordering the PM to beg the EU for a Brexit extension if he has not secured a deal by October 19.\n\nMr Bercow was also at the centre of protests against the PM's decision to prorogue Parliament in the run-up to Brexit, saying it was 'not normal'.\n\nAt Tory conference last week, the current Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said he admired many of the things the Speaker had done in his 10-year tenure.\n\nBut he said Mr Bercow's 'recent mistakes' had brought the public standing of the House to 'the lowest point in modern history'.\n\nAllies of the PM have made clear he will not follow the convention that Commons Speakers are automatically elevated to the upper chamber when they resign.\n\nMr Bercow dramatically announced last month that he will stand down from the chair and as an MP on October 31 - symbolically choosing Boris Johnson's 'do or die' Brexit date.\n\nMr Bercow was branded a 'verbal playground bully' today as MPs lined up to take his place as Commons Speaker.\n\nNine senior parliamentarians took pot shots at the controversial parliamentary gatekeeper as they too part in a special hustings ahead of an election for the role.\n\nMr Bercow, who has infuriated Brexiteers over his interventionist policy over Brexit, and been at the heart of a bullying controversy, is to step down at the end of the month after a decade in the chair.\n\nTory MP Shailesh Vara said he believed Mr Bercow had 'tarnished the role of Speaker with his biasness' over Brexit and described him as a 'verbal playground bully'.\n\nMr Vara said Mr Bercow 'loses all authority to lecture to MPs as to how they should behave when his own behaviour is in question'.\n\nHe added: 'So I think that the speaker should always be courteous and polite, authoritative yes, but not demeaning to his colleagues.'\n\nThe election of the next Commons Speaker will take place on November 4, after Mr Bercow - who has held the office since 2009 - takes the chair for the final time on October 31.\n\nOne Cabinet minister told MailOnline at the weekend that the powers of the Speaker must be curbed if the Tories win the next election.\n\n'I think we need a shake-up of the rules and the Speaker's powers and I think it's something we need to look at after the election if we get a majority,' they said\n\n'When you have a rogue speaker, he is all-powerful.\n\n'Parliament has a rulebook and it has conventions about its procedures that have developed over a long period for a very good reason.\n\n'You can't have someone in that position getting up in the morning and deciding that he is going to do things differently and bend the rules as he wishes.'", "description": "David Sassoli revealed he held talks with Mr Bercow in London last night, telling MEPs they were on the 'same wavelength'.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19497924-0-image-a-27_1570634190685.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
