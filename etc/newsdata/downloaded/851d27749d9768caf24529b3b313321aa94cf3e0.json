Here\u2019s How It Really Earns Billions a Year", "language": "en", "text": "Have you ever wondered how Costco makes money?\n\nMost people know that the membership-only mega-retailer sells items in large quantities at what are basically wholesale prices, so where\u2019s the profit in that? Turns out, it\u2019s all in the membership fees, according to a Twitter thread that went viral over the weekend.\n\nThe thread by an investor explained to the general public what most experts in retail circles have known for some time \u2014 Costco\u2019s high volume of sales and rapid turnover of inventory are not the real reason the company is so profitable: the memberships are. The cheapest membership option is the Gold Star card, which costs $60 annually. The more expensive membership card, the Gold Star Executive card, costs $120 a year and has added perks like 2% cash back on eligible purchases.\n\nCostco is a fascinating business.\n\n\n\nYou know all those groceries you buy?\n\n\n\nYeah, they basically sell those at breakeven and then make all of their profit from the $60 annual membership fees.\n\n\n\nQuick [THREAD]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ryan Reeves (@investing_city) October 4, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\nSince Costco operates at very low gross margins \u2014 if you buy 5 pounds of peanut butter for $10, the company makes only $1 off your purchase, according to the thread \u2014 it can\u2019t make big bucks just by selling you things cheaply. But, since the retailer has developed a reputation for having consistently lower prices than its competitors, it has something called \u201cprice authority,\u201d meaning Costco can lean on suppliers for competitive prices and also rely on consumers to steadily continue signing up for and renewing their memberships. The company had a 90% member renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada last year (and 88% worldwide), according to the company\u2019s annual report.\n\nThere are more than 53 million paid members as of this year, according to the Twitter thread. That means Costco is on track to make $4.3 billion from memberships in 2019, which accounts for essentially all of the company\u2019s profit so far, the thread says.", "description": "A recent Twitter thread explained the business model.", "authors": ["Alix Langone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fE1fsQeUKTUiDxRHu1dcsw--~B/aD0zMzM0O3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/3d26d24bfb1e13b6b4dd7c4a465073c2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
