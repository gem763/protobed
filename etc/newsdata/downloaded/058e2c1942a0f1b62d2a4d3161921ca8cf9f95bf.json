Steve King Endorses Neo-Nazi Sympathizer Faith Goldy. GOP Says Nothing.", "language": "en", "text": "Once again, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) publicly declared his support for white nationalist and neo-Nazi figures and, once again, Republican leadership remains silent.\n\nKing, who is currently running for re-election, tweeted an endorsement late Tuesday evening for Faith Goldy, a white supremacist, right-wing YouTube star running for the mayor of Toronto.\n\n\u201cFaith Goldy, an excellent candidate for Toronto mayor, pro Rule of Law, pro Make Canada Safe Again, pro balanced budget, &...BEST of all, Pro Western Civilization and a fighter for our values. @FaithGoldy will not be silenced,\u201d the eight-term congressman tweeted last night, despite polls having the neo-Nazi-sympathizing Toronto native at just 1.5 percent.\n\n\u201cWho wants to tell @SteveKingIA that Toronto isn't in the U.S.?,\u201d King\u2019s opponent, Democrat and ex-pro baseball player J.D Scholten hit back on Twitter. \u201cOnce again, Steve King spends more time supporting far-right leaders in other countries than he does focusing on the needs of the people of our district.\u201d\n\nGoldy is a self-described \u201ctough on crime and easy on taxpayers\u201d far-right figure who rose to prominence by promoting white nationalism and anti-Semitism, cultivating ties with neo-Nazi groups, and regularly spreading their rhetoric through her massive social-media following.\n\nLast August, Goldy covered the deadly Unite the Right protest in Charlottesville as a correspondent for Rebel Media, a conservative Canadian outlet (also the former home of Proud Boys leader Gavin McInnes), but was later fired after appearing on a show hosted by neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer.\n\nIn the interview, Goldy told host and fellow far-right YouTuber Stefan Molyneux that neo-Nazis offer \u201crobust\u201d and \u201cwell thought-out ideas\u201d about the \u201cJQ,\u201d a.k.a., the \u201cJewish question,\u201d a common anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about Jewish people controlling many aspects of society.\n\n\u201cI was upset that she went to the Charlottesville protests, despite my direction to her not to go in any capacity,\u201d said Rebel Media founder Ezra Levant in a post explaining Goldy\u2019s termination. \u201cBut then I saw the news that she went on a podcast from the Daily Stormer, and it was just too far. So we said goodbye.\u201d\n\nOnce leaving the right-wing outlet, however, Goldy\u2019s neo-Nazi rhetoric only intensified. In December, she posted a live-streamed interview in which she recited the \u201cFourteen Words,\u201d a set of racist and anti-Semitic white-nationalist slogans. After internet outcry, Goldy doubled down, calling the \u201cFourteen Words\u201d a \u201csimple statement of survival.\u201d\n\nThis year, during a video chat with white supremacist Ayla Stewart, Goldy recommended to her fans a 1930\u2019s book For My Legionaries, written by Romanian fascist and anti-Semitic leader Corneliu Codreanu. The book advocates for the elimination of \u201cthe Jewish menace.\u201d Goldy later stated that she does \u201cnot endorse\u201d that passage, but doubled down on her endorsement of the book overall.\n\nRep. King isn\u2019t the the only American conservative to openly stand with the Canadian neo-Nazi sympathizer, solidifying her role among the ascendant pro-Trump right.\n\nIn September, former New York City mayor and current Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, posed for a series of pictures with Goldy at an event. \u201cJust like Giuliani cleaned up the streets of NYC, our tough on crime playbook is going to run illegal guns & gangs right out of Toronto!\u201d Goldy wrote on Twitter.\n\nKing\u2019s endorsement of Goldy is just the latest in a long series of public declarations from the congressman indicating a shift from simply being an \u201cimmigration hardliner\u201d to being openly sympathetic to far-right, racist ideologies.\n\nAnd Republican leaders have continually turned a blind eye. House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on King\u2019s endorsement of the neo-Nazi-sympathizing mayoral candidate. The National Republican Congressional Committee also declined The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.\n\nGOP leaders haven\u2019t offered much of a rebuke to other recent King outbursts.\n\nLast year, the congressman retweeted an endorsement of Geert Wilders, a far-right Dutch anti-Islamic politician, adding his own suggestion that Muslim children are preventing \u201cour civilization\u201d from being restored.\n\n\u201cWilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny,\u201d King wrote in support of the chairman of the Freedom Party. \u201cWe can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.\u201d\n\nThat message was met with widespread outcry among political observers, but unsurprisingly earned praise from white nationalists like former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.\n\n\u201cJust in case you were thinking about moving -> sanity reigns supreme in Iowa's 4th congressional district,\u201d Duke glowingly wrote, referring to the district King represents.\n\nHouse Speaker Ryan\u2019s only comment on his colleague\u2019s shocking comments: \u201cI disagree.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party of Iowa, however, did openly reproach King. \u201cFirst of all, I do not agree with Congressman King's statement. We are a nation of immigrants, and diversity is the strength of any nation and any community,\u201d state party chairman Jeff Kaufmann said in a statement at the time. \u201cRegarding David Duke, his words and sentiments are absolute garbage. He is not welcome in our wonderful state.\u201d\n\nKaufmann did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment on King's support for Goldy.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, King diminished the contributions of minorities to modern civilization.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you\u2019re talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?,\u201d King declared, shocking his co-panelists during a discussion on MSNBC\u2019s All In with Chris Hayes.\n\n\u201cThan white people?,\" a befuddled Hayes asked.\n\n\u201cThan, than Western civilization itself,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s rooted in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the United States of America and every place where the footprint of Christianity settled the world. That\u2019s all of Western civilization.\u201d\n\nAnd last September, King bashed San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for his decision to protest police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem , calling it activism that\u2019s sympathetic to ISIS.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s open embrace of racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric first came under the nation spotlight in 2013 when he claimed that young, undocumented immigrants have \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will retweet the devil if the devil tweets, \u201cI Love Jesus,\u201d he wrote on Monday defending his many retweets of white-nationalist figures. \u201cIt\u2019s the message, not the messenger.\u201d\n\nAt this point, King is best-known for promoting white nationalism without any real political consequence. Or without doing much actual legislating.\n\n\u201cIn his almost 16 years in Congress, King has passed exactly one bill as primary sponsor, redesignating a post office,\u201d the Des Moines Register wrote this week while endorsing his opponent. \u201cHe won\u2019t debate his opponent and rarely holds public town halls. Instead, he spends his time meeting with fascist leaders in Europe and retweeting neo-Nazis.\u201d\n\nAnd while Republican congressional leaders fail to condemn or censure their colleague, he has earned the praise of the most powerful Republican in politics: President Trump.\n\n\"I wish you could get a little more conservative. He may be the world's most conservative human being,\u201d the president remarked last week during an Iowa rally.", "description": "The far-right congressman once again publicly embraced a white-nationalist public figure and his party\u2019s leaders remain silent.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1539804049/181017-Melendez-steve-king-tease_zsygbm", "published_at": "2018-10-17"}
