The case is expected to be heard in June of 2020.\n\nThe law says doctors must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where the abortion is performed. It was enacted in Louisiana, an overwhelmingly conservative state, but struck down in 2017 in the Federal District Court in the state\u2019s capital, when a judge said that the law created an unnecessary burden on women\u2019s constitutional right to abortion.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Now, abortion rights activists are preparing to revisit that battle in the new court. But Mr Trump\u2019s vow to the evangelical right to uphold anti-abortion laws means that his justice picks are likely to see this case as a chance to swing at Roe v Wade.\n\n\u201cAccess to abortion is hanging by a thread in this country, and this case is what could snap that thread,\u201d said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cThere\u2019s only one reason the court would not strike down the Louisiana law and that is because Justice Kennedy, who voted to protect abortion access just three years ago, has been replaced with Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

As many activists said during the inititial commotion around the series of anti-abortion laws, many mimicking the outright ban Alabama championed in April, the goal of these laws was to bring them to the Supreme Court, in an effort to eventually overturn Roe v Wade, which this administration has sworn it would do.\n\nIlyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement that it\u2019s \u201cno accident\u201d that the case was taken u on the anniversary of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, who is thought to have been placed on the Court for, among other reasons, his anti-choice stance.\n\n\u201cThis is their playbook: stack the federal bench with anti-choice judges to gut reproductive rights,\u201d Ms Hogue said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision to review a case that is virtually identical to a case that was settled just three years ago is further proof that Donald Trump has paid back his debts and then some to an anti-choice minority that put him in office. The only thing that has changed since the Supreme Court decided Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt in 2016 is the composition of the Court.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the Supreme Court will uphold precedent and protect Louisiana women and families' basic rights, but no matter what, NARAL will continue to fight back against the anti-choice movement\u2019s attacks on reproductive freedom and hold those responsible for putting anti-choice justices on the bench accountable,\u201d she added.", "description": "The Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case since\u00a0Donald Trump installed two justices who are both expected to vote in an anti-abortion way.
