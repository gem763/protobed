It was the latest in a string of relentless attacks during the U.S.-led talks with Taliban leaders and marked the fourth American death at the hands of the radical Islamist group over the past two weeks.\n\nThe government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has long complained that it has been shut out of the talks, led by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and held in Qatar. A report said even Secretary of State Mike Pompeo harbors doubts about the proposed agreement. Mr. Khalilzad was reportedly rushing back to Qatar in the wake of the Kabul attack for more talks with Taliban leaders.\n\nIn Afghanistan and Washington, frustration is mounting over the U.S. strategy of negotiating with a partner that regularly kills American military personnel, indiscriminately targets civilians and publicly boasts about returning Afghanistan to the pre-9/11 era.\n\nWaheed Omer, Mr. Ghani\u2019s director of public and strategic affairs, told reporters in Kabul that concerns are \u201cvery high\u201d in the government and among the people of Afghanistan about what the U.S. accord contains.\n\n\u201cAfghans have been bitten by this snake before,\u201d he said, according to an account by The Associated Press. \u201cThey have seen the results of hasty deals, of deals they and their voices weren\u2019t part of.\u201d\n\nMilitary observers and regional analysts say there is an increasing realization that the deal as constructed, especially with the Taliban showing little good faith, may die.\n\n\u201cThis deal amounts to a humiliating capitulation,\u201d said Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who has tracked the 18-year-old Afghanistan war extensively.\n\n\u201cI believe, at least among U.S. policymakers, military and intelligence circles, there is a rising tide of disapproval,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if anyone wants to put their name on this deal because history will record them signing a humiliating American defeat in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Time reported late Wednesday that Mr. Pompeo is refusing to sign off on the agreement that Mr. Khalilzad negotiated.\n\nUnder the deal, roughly 5,400 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan would be withdrawn and five military bases in the country would be shuttered in short order. In exchange, the Taliban would guarantee that Afghanistan will never again be used as a base from which terrorist groups can attack the West.\n\nThe deal reportedly does not require an end to the Taliban\u2019s brutal attacks or explicitly call for a U.S.-backed government in Kabul to remain in full control of Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Pompeo and other officials also reportedly object to the Taliban\u2019s insistence that the U.S. recognize the \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan\u201d \u2014 the nation\u2019s formal name during the Taliban\u2019s five-year reign leading up to the al Qaeda terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nMr. Trump has made a major policy goal of winding down the deployment and chafes at U.S. military officials\u2019 arguments for a long-term role in Afghanistan. Mr. Pompeo, who publicly backs the president, argues that the U.S. has largely accomplished its mission.\n\n\u201cIf you go back and look at the days following 9/11, the objectives set out were pretty clear: to go defeat al Qaeda, the group that had launched the attack on the United States of America from Afghanistan,\u201d he told The Daily Signal in an interview published late Wednesday. \u201cAnd today, al Qaeda \u2026 doesn\u2019t even amount to a shadow of its former self in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWe have delivered,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Khalilzad said earlier this week that the two sides had reached a deal \u201cin principle.\u201d\n\nA lack of clarity\n\nOn Capitol Hill, key lawmakers say Mr. Trump and Mr. Khalilzad have been less than forthcoming about details of the peace plan. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel, New York Democrat, sent a letter Thursday to Mr. Khalilzad demanding testimony before Congress.\n\nHis blunt letter, which suggests that Democrats will subpoena Mr. Khalilzad if he doesn\u2019t agree to appear on Capitol Hill soon, underscores how lawmakers have been largely kept in the dark.\n\n\u201cI understand your team has established a framework agreement with the Taliban, and that a copy of this agreement has been disseminated among officials in the Trump administration and shared with [the government in Afghanistan],\u201d Mr. Engel wrote. \u201cSimilarly, the American and Afghan people deserve to know what the administration\u2019s diplomatic strategy is for Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cAfter nearly two decades of war, we all want to see the fighting in Afghanistan come to an end. But we want to make sure we are negotiating a peace and not simply a withdrawal,\u201d Mr. Engel added.\n\nOpposition among the beleaguered U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan also is building. After the attack Thursday in Kabul, Mr. Ghani said the U.S. cannot continue talks as long as the Taliban are targeting civilians.\n\n\u201cPeace with a group that is still killing innocent people is meaningless,\u201d he said.\n\nThe suicide car bombing was the latest in a series of attacks by the Taliban, who have made clear that they believe violence is a way to extract more concessions from the U.S.\n\nThe most recent incident resulted in the fourth death of an American service member in the past two weeks. NATO\u2019s Resolute Support Mission confirmed the deaths but did not identify the service member.\n\nSurveillance cameras captured the bomber\u2019s vehicle approaching a checkpoint in a crowded diplomatic area of Kabul near the U.S. Embassy, The Associated Press reported. The vehicle then exploded.\n\nIn addition to the 12 deaths, at least 42 people were wounded.\n\nPressed at an Oval Office event Wednesday about the Afghanistan talks and the trustworthiness of the Taliban, Mr. Trump provided little clarity beyond his desire to wind up a fight in which he said the U.S. military was functioning as \u201cpolicemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking to the Taliban, we\u2019re talking to the government,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can do something. It\u2019s been a long time. We have great warriors there, we have great soldiers. But they\u2019re not acting as soldiers.\u201d\n\nSome analysts say the lack of security guarantees in the draft deal, coupled with the Taliban\u2019s refusal to tamp down attacks, could sway even the most ardent supporters of a negotiated peace agreement, including the Afghan-born Mr. Khalilzad, who has spent countless hours negotiating with the Taliban and has seemed personally invested in brokering peace.\n\n\u201cIf there is a severe backlash like I believe we\u2019re starting to see, he might not want to sign it either,\u201d Mr. Roggio said.\n\nIf the administration moves forward, he said, the results will be disastrous and could ultimately end with the Taliban trying to fully overthrow the U.S.-backed government in Kabul.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re granting approval to the Taliban to go on a rampage after the U.S. leaves,\u201d Mr. Roggio said of the administration\u2019s approach.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
