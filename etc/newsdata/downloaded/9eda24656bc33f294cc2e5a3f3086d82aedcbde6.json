He needs to stay in 10 Downing Street until 20 November to avoid being the shortest serving prime minister ever (George Canning, who died in office in 1827, served for 119 days). But on his 87th day, 19 October, just three weeks away, he faces a make-or-break moment.\n\nHe has three options on that day. He can get a Brexit deal approved by the House of Commons, in which case we will leave the EU on or soon after 31 October (we may need a few extra days to get the necessary legislation through parliament).\n\nIf a withdrawal agreement is not approved, Johnson is required by law to ask the EU to extend the Brexit deadline. I have yet to see a plausible way round the law and I suspect Johnson and Dominic Cummings, his chief of staff, are bluffing when they suggest there is one.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

That means one of three apparently impossible things has to happen: a deal goes through the Commons; Johnson asks for an extension; or he resigns.\n\nThis week EU officials described the likelihood of a new deal as \u201cpretty much nil\u201d, which must be too negative, given Johnson\u2019s desperation to secure a deal \u2013 any deal.

It seems unthinkable that he should give up the office of prime minister voluntarily. In the opinion of one former cabinet minister, he would ask for the extension and announce a referendum.\n\nAs ever, though, what would the question be? Labour has finally decided what the question would be in its referendum, but at the price of ridicule about Jeremy Corbyn negotiating a \u201csensible Leave option\u201d against which he would then campaign. If Johnson put a deal that the Commons had rejected to a referendum, he couldn\u2019t guarantee that parliament would vote for it even if the people did.\n\nMeanwhile, he would be limping on as a discredited leader, whose absolute assertions about leaving on 31 October had turned to dust. He would be weaker than Theresa May.\n\nSo I think he is more likely to resign as prime minister and declare that he wants to fight an election as leader of the Conservative Party. A temporary prime minister would have to ask for the extension, at which point the opposition parties would have no excuse for standing in the way of an election.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they would vote for one, though, especially if Johnson looked as if he might win. And there is some evidence that the failure to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d at the end of October wouldn\u2019t damage Johnson that much, as long as the voters think he tried.\n\nSome members of a focus group of undecided former Labour voters in Stoke, convened for The Times this week, said that, if Johnson was forced to ask for an extension, it would make them more likely to vote Conservative. One of them, Tony, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not Boris Johnson\u2019s fault. I think we\u2019ll get behind him even more to make a statement that MPs have got to do what the people of this country voted for.\u201d\n\nIf it looks likely that Johnson would win an election, then, Labour MPs may continue to obstruct it, meaning he might be giving up the post of prime minister for a state of limbo \u2013 and Kenneth Clarke, if it is he, could be temporary prime minister for a while.\n\nThe only good outcome for Johnson is to get a deal through the Commons before \u2013 which probably means on \u2013 Saturday 19 October.\n\nYet even if, like a comic book superhero, he escapes the closing walls at the last moment, he will only find himself in more trouble. If he \u201cgets Brexit done\u201d and we can finally talk about something else, it may turn out that what we talk about is the prospect of a criminal investigation into his time as mayor of London.\n\nSo far No 10 has dismissed the referral of allegations to the police as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. I don\u2019t think it is, but even if it were, so what? Tony Blair was referred to the police \u2013 over the claim he had promised peerages in return for loans to Labour funds \u2013 by a Scottish National Party press release.\n\nIf there is a difference it is that there was never any evidence of wrongdoing in Blair\u2019s case, whereas Johnson does at least appear to have a case to answer. The BBC has reported that his office, as mayor, intervened to secure Jennifer Arcuri, the US business woman, a place on a trade mission to Tel Aviv.\n\nNothing has gone right for Boris Johnson as prime minister. Even if the first stage of Brexit goes right for him \u2013 and that\u2019s a remote possibility \u2013 there is plenty else that is ready to go wrong.", "description": "Boris Johnson has been prime minister for 66 days.
