And for that the relationship with the teacher is of paramount importance.\n\n\u201cBehavior management and teachers\u2019 health help create a quality program for children\u201d Dr. Dana Charles McCoy, study author and professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education told ABC News. \u201cSeveral decades of research has shown that high quality programs can have a good impact.\u201d\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nTeachers in low-income areas of Chicago received training through the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP). The idea is that if teachers know the best ways to interact with preschoolers, the children will learn better and taking the time to train teachers makes them feel more valued and appreciated as well.\n\n\u201cTeachers received professional development courses that focused primarily on behavior management strategies in the classroom and how to avoid harsh discipline, but to instead promote behaviors. This reduced their own stress.\u201d Says Dr. McCoy. \u201cTeachers received Masters level mental health education.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teachers received the training and passed it on to the children, improving structural quality and warmth and organization of the teachers into the classroom\u201d McCoy says.\n\nMcCoy suggests that these types of interventions may contribute to a good learning environment for kids, and Marie Spinney, an experienced NYC Department of Education Pre-K teacher, agrees.\n\n\u201cAnytime that you\u2019re able to bring something back to the classroom, any sort of coaching and it works, it does increase learning,\u201d Marie Spinney told ABC News in an interview.\n\n\u201cIn the Pre-K level it\u2019s about the process, not as much as the achievement.\u201d Spinney says, \"Being able to focus on the process, on what they need help with, sets them up for kindergarten. Sets them up for success.\u201d\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nAnd the professional development gives teachers confidence too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very empowering. You [the teacher] feel more supported. You feel like you\u2019re being valued as a teacher and that feeling helps with the kids because you are excited,\u201d Spinney says.\n\n\u201cKids need more than academic content. Emotional, social, and cognitive skills help them engage and learn in the classroom and get along with peers and engage in academic content,\u201d McCoy told ABC News. McCoy hopes this study will \u201cshift from talking whether preschool is important to moving conversation to what aspect of preschool creates the biggest impact for kids. What defines a high-quality preschool program and ensures that all kids have the ability to receive those qualities.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say that, \u201clow-income background kids don\u2019t have the same opportunities as people from more advantaged backgrounds. So these types of programs are trying to promote equity and give kids from all different backgrounds the opportunity to succeed.\u201d\n\nHowever, it may not be that simple.\n\nWhile \u201cprofessional development is worthwhile,\u201d says Spinney, \u201cimplementing it may not be as straightforward.\u201d\n\nEach child is different.\n\nAnother study on \u201cChildren\u2019s first-person experiences,\u201d points out \u201cthat the linguistic environment of a preschool classroom is highly dynamic from the perspective of the learner.\u201d The study suggests that many children often interact with teachers in the classroom frequently, but that the length of these interactions varies from child to child.\n\nMcCoy reminds us, that \u201cearly preschool programming can impact trajectories into adulthood,\u201d and that, \u201cthis study gives us an idea of what types of practices in the classroom are able to promote education and well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe take home lesson, hopefully, can benefit all kids,\u201d she says.\n\nKimberly Dike, M.D., is a senior internal medicine resident physician at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
