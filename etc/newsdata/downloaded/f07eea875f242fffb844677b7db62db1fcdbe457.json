(Jacob Kupferman/Getty Images)\n\nWe already knew that Panthers quarterback Cam Newton would not be playing in Carolina\u2019s Week 4 game against the Texans in Houston. Without going too much into the specifics of Newton\u2019s injury \u2014 it reportedly was thought to be a mid-foot sprain \u2014 Panthers\u2019 Coach Ron Rivera made that announcement on Monday, saying there was no timetable for his quarterback\u2019s return.\n\nThere might be a timetable now, and it\u2019s not good for the Panthers or Newton.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Athletic\u2019s Joe Person reported and the NFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero confirmed that Newton is believed to be dealing with a Lisfranc injury in his foot, a much more significant injury that involves broken mid-foot bones or torn ligaments \u2014 or both \u2014 and is often confused for a simple sprain. Such injuries often take months to heal and may require surgery, meaning the Panthers will move forward with Kyle Allen as their quarterback for the foreseeable future.\n\nPelissero reports that the Panthers hope to avoid surgery and will stick with a plan that involves rehabilitation. Such an option is only possible if there are no broken bones or torn ligaments. According to Cedars-Sinai, \u201cit is very important not to put weight on your foot during the initial healing period\u201d and patients must wear a non-weight-bearing cast or boot for six weeks after the initial diagnosis.\n\nIn 2013, Redskins safety Phillip Thomas missed his entire rookie season after suffering a Lisfranc injury during the team\u2019s preseason opener (he would return to play eight games for Washington in 2014 before being waived; he has not played in the NFL since). In 2017, Redskins defensive tackle Jonathan Allen suffered a Lisfranc injury during a game in October and missed the rest of the season (however, he returned in 2018 and has started 19 straight games for the Redskins).\n\nAccording to Lower Extremity Review magazine, 28 NFL players suffered Lisfranc injuries between 2000 and 2010. Only two never returned to competition. But the median time to return was 11.1 months from the time of injury, and only three players returned in less than three months.\n\nMaking his second career start Sunday against the Cardinals, Allen completed 19 of 26 passes for 261 yards and four touchdowns as Carolina won for the first time this season. According to ESPN Stats and Info, Allen\u2019s 90.6 QBR is the highest by any quarterback in his first two career starts.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nNFL power rankings Week 4: Cowboys, Packers are on the heels of the Rams in the NFL\n\n\u2018Unlike Agholor,\u2019 Philadelphia residents catch babies thrown from burning building\n\nJalen Ramsey Jaguars trade speculation, explained: The cornerback is sick (and tired) of Jacksonville\n\nGiants\u2019 Saquon Barkley has high-ankle sprain, could miss four to eight weeks\n\nThe 0-3 Denver Broncos are in a \u2018world of suck.\u2019 Here\u2019s why.", "description": "He reportedly has suffered a Lisfranc injury.
