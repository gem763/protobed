REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nWith a cast also including Gary Oldman, Antonio Banderas and Sharon Stone, the Netflix film, which premieres at the Venice Film Festival on Sunday, seeks to explain the debacle via lessons from characters\u2019 personal stories.\n\nThe so-called Panama Papers, consisting of millions of leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca in April 2016, provoked a global scandal after revealing how the rich and powerful used offshore corporations to evade taxes.\n\nSpeaking directly to viewers, Oldman and Banderas portray lawyers Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca who try to give their side of the story.\n\nIn a similar manner to \u201cThe Big Short\u201d about the 2007 financial crisis, the two quirkily explain the world of shell companies and offshore accounts to the audience, who are also taken on a journey of illicit dealings as well as corruption via China, the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a moment where the news cycle is racing and we are racing to keep up with current events and this is an entertaining, flash, funny way of telling a very, very dark black hearted joke, a joke that\u2019s being played on all of us,\u201d Streep told a news conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crime not without victims and the victims many of them are journalists,\u201d she added, citing Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered while investigating corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Laundromat\u201d is one of two Netflix films vying for the festival\u2019s top Golden Lion prize, which the streaming giant won last year for \u201cRoma\u201d.\n\nOscar winner Soderbergh, known for \u201cTraffic\u201d, \u201cErin Brokovich\u201d and \u201cMagic Mike\u201d, said he took inspiration from \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d as he and writer Scott Z. Burns looked how to present \u201ca complex subject in a way that would be memorable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe decided that a dark comedy had the best possible chance of remaining in the minds of the viewers and also gave us the opportunity to use the complexity of these kind of financial activities almost as a joke, almost as the setup for a punchline,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very troubling time but speaking about it is the beginning, people have been speaking about it for quite a while but on occasion a piece of entertainment can be a conversation starter and get people wondering day to day \u2018in my everyday life how am I participating in this\u2019.\u201d", "description": "A holiday tragedy sends Oscar winner Meryl Streep on a puzzling probe of ambiguous financial dealings in Steven Soderbergh's \"The Laundromat\", a drama based on the massive leak of offshore financial data known as the Panama Papers.", "authors": ["Sarah Mills", "Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425130905&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801XG-OCAEN"}
