In August, he campaigned and DJed\u2014shirtless, cross around his neck, mojito in hand\u2014at a beach club where female dancers in low-cut leopard-print bathing suits gyrated to the Italian national anthem. Throughout, his social-media accounts posted a steady stream of videos of cats, dogs, food, and immigrants behaving badly. Salvini\u2019s formula has been to combine tough \u201cus versus them\u201d talk on immigration and emotional, yet vague, defenses of national identity with an Italian-everyman relatability. \u201cBuongiorno, amici!\u201d is his standard form of address. \u201cHello, friends!\u201d After each rally, Salvini poses for selfies, sometimes for hours. Every selfie a vote, is his strategy. His clever use of social media\u2014his Facebook page has more overall engagement than President Donald Trump\u2019s\u2014has helped him build a cult of personality that\u2019s painstakingly curated so as to make him seem unscripted. His popularity has allowed him to transcend his party, the right-wing League, and become the face of Italy, eclipsing the prime minister in the public imagination.\n\nIn 15 months as the junior member of the government, Salvini\u2019s relentless campaigning\u2014while interior minister\u2014helped his party double its standing in opinion polls, clearly outpacing any other party, including his former coalition partner, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. The League placed first in Italy in elections for the European Parliament in May, with 34 percent of the vote. All the while, Salvini has shrugged off unanswered questions about the League\u2019s ties to Russia and whether he really wants Italy to stay in the euro. The seemingly unstoppable momentum emboldened Salvini to put his popularity to the test. He withdrew his party\u2019s support for the government, forcing a crisis in a bid for new elections that he hoped would make him prime minister of the first far-right government of a major European power. He didn\u2019t get his wish this time. Instead, the Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party\u2014one representing the populist anti-establishment, the other the establishment\u2014put aside their long-standing mutual animosity to form the strangest new government in recent Italian history, one with a sole purpose: to block Salvini. Salvini may have miscalculated\u2014out of hubris, perhaps\u2014yet he is still at the forefront of Italian and European politics; he is the center of gravity, the man whom rivals fear most. The rise of this charismatic former talk-radio host, political chameleon, and turbocharged techno-populist is instructive, and marks a new and notable chapter of democracy in the age of social media. Salvini has swiftly and dramatically changed the culture in Italy, humanizing far-right rhetoric and making public discourse and the mood on the street rougher and more aggressive. He is not simply a Donald Trump facsimile in Europe, nor merely the archetype of an angry anti-immigrant nationalist in the Viktor Orb\u00e1n mold. Salvini has been writing an entirely new playbook for 21st-century populism.\n\nMore than a Mediterranean hothouse, Italy has always been a political laboratory, a harbinger of things to come. Its revolutions have all been right-wing\u2014from fascism to futurism to Silvio Berlusconi. Yet what has been unfolding with Salvini has implications beyond Italy, across Europe and for other democracies. More than any politician in the world today, he has been testing the relationship between clicks and consensus\u2014whether slow-moving institutions in Italy and Europe, to say nothing of rival political parties, can withstand the use of lightning-fast, reactive social media. Whereas Trump has used Twitter, both while campaigning and in office, to set the news agenda, Salvini goes a step further. He uses it to bring his supporters closer to him, making them feel as though he is one of them. While Trump\u2019s rallies are where he seems to feel most at home, for Salvini it is also the moments after, when he spends hours, arm extended, taking selfies with his supporters. And though Trump\u2019s social-media missives give off an air of haphazard responsiveness, Salvini\u2019s are part of a well-honed machine that has given significant thought to experimenting with whether Facebook likes translate into votes. In many ways, Salvini, whose supporters call him \u201cIl Capitano,\u201d or \u201cthe captain,\u201d is a product of circumstance. Berlusconi, who stepped down as prime minister in 2011, paved the way. His Forza Italia was also a charismatic movement and stunted the growth of a non-personality-driven Italian right. It was Berlusconi\u2019s private television networks that created a viewership that then became an electorate years before Trump did the same with The Apprentice. On his watch, Italy\u2019s economy lost years\u2014it has barely grown in two decades\u2014and its electorate, already cynical, became even more disillusioned. Then came Trump, who emboldened nativist copycats worldwide. Salvini shares a siege mentality with Trump. He has championed a bill that legalizes shooting intruders in self-defense, and another that would allow chemical castration of rapists. What the southern border is to Trump, ports are to Salvini, and he has pledged to close them to what he calls an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants entering the country illegally.\n\nIn the process, he has started a battle over the soul of Italy: whether it\u2019s a country of the big-hearted \u201cdo-gooders\u201d Salvini disparages, or of tough border defenders. Salvini\u2019s focus on migrants isn\u2019t just about immigration. It\u2019s a fluid frame that easily and quickly expands into vaguer and more emotional questions of national identity, race, and belonging. A savvy politician can fish for years in these deep waters. There\u2019s something of the \u201creturn of the repressed\u201d about Salvini. He is a product of Europe\u2019s (and Italy\u2019s) mishandling of the immigration crisis and the debt crisis. He has easy access to Italian sentiments of anger, powerlessness, economic instability\u2014feelings that helped populists come to power in 2018, when the Five Star Movement, with its promises of a minimum basic income for low-earning Italians, placed first, the center-left Democratic Party second, and the League third. Trump\u2019s tweets cause international incidents; Salvini\u2019s are a running ticker of the Italian subconscious. This allows him to be at once ubiquitous and totally opaque\u2014and to keep everyone guessing about his motives and beliefs, ever present online but rarely clarifying his stance on major issues. The near-total control Salvini exercises over his party and its message makes it extremely difficult to pin him down. How far to the right is he, exactly? Would he moderate if he became prime minister? Would he push Italy closer to the Visegr\u00e1d group of central and eastern European countries, or work with Brussels? Italy has seven NATO bases; where does he stand on NATO? What are his views on race? What about the euro? What does he believe in, exactly, beyond his own will to power?\n\nI asked these questions in Italy for months, as Salvini rose and rose in the polls, and interviewed dozens of people. And for months, I was gaslit by Salvini advisers who dismissed my questions as typical of the \u201cmainstream\u201d media, or who told me Salvini didn\u2019t intend to alter any existing treaties, but then wouldn\u2019t go on the record because they didn\u2019t have permission to talk. I was met with blank stares, and looked at as if I were crazy. What do you mean, \u201cpolitical evolution\u201d? What do you mean, \u201cbelieve in\u201d? Some of the best minds in Italy told me they thought not even Salvini knew what he wanted or believed in, besides polls. Many Italians see Salvini\u2019s rise and his transformation of the League in terms of pure Machiavellian power politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no ideology,\u201d Maurizio Molinari, the editor in chief of La Stampa, an Italian daily, told me. Salvini would \u201ceven sell his mother\u201d if it helped him get votes, Molinari said. Flavio Tosi, a former mayor of Verona from the League who had a falling-out with Salvini, told me Salvini believes in \u201cwhatever helps him electorally\u201d at any given moment. \u201cIf tomorrow Italians wanted immigration, he\u2019d want it, too,\u201d Tosi said. Alessandro Trocino, who\u2019s followed Salvini for two decades as a reporter for the Italian daily Corriere della Sera and written a history of the League, describes a Jekyll-and-Hyde quality to Salvini. At dinner, \u201che\u2019s totally reasonable, he says sensible things, he\u2019s never extreme. He\u2019s very nice and is a great communicator,\u201d Trocino told me. Then, at his rallies, he says \u201cmonstrous\u201d things, like that Italian cities need a \u201cmass cleansing\u201d to rid them of immigrants.\n\nTrocino, like most veteran Italian political journalists, shrugs this off as a naked power play. Salvini saw an opening on the right after the decline of Berlusconi and he claimed it, which meant tacking right on immigration and values issues. Trocino told me he still has a T-shirt Salvini gave him when he was leader of the Young Padanians, the League\u2019s youth group, back when the party was called the Northern League and railed against Rome\u2019s stealing its hard-earned tax revenue and sending it to what the party saw as the lazy bums of the violent, organized-crime-ridden south. It reads: Milan works, Rome steals, Naples shoots. The League was founded in 1989 as the Northern League, a separatist party that mostly wanted more tax autonomy for Italy\u2019s wealthy north. Its rhetoric tended toward the xenophobic even then, and had folkloristic elements\u2014a veneration of the Po river and a belief in a fictional, vaguely Celtic-inspired homeland called Padania, which the party claimed it wanted to secede from Italy. The party\u2019s color was green and its logo a wagon wheel whose spokes were leaves. When Salvini was elected party leader in December 2013, it was polling at 4 percent and in the throes of a scandal in which its co-founder and other officials were charged with absconding with \u20ac49 million, or $54 million, in public funds. (A court dropped the fraud charges, saying the statute of limitations had expired, but ruled that the party must still repay the funds.)\n\nSalvini has transformed the League into a national party, replacing Rome with Brussels, the de facto seat of the European Union, as the enemy and subjugator. He now rails against the tyranny of the EU\u2014in particular its failings on immigration and its irritating rules, including one requiring Italy to keep its budget deficits low. The party\u2019s color has changed to blue and its logo is a knight on horseback wielding a sword, a kind of male Joan of Arc defending the nation. Under Salvini, the League has been courting, and winning over, voters in the Italian south, land of economic stagnation and high unemployment\u2014the same southern regions from which his party once wanted to secede. A model for the party\u2019s transformation is France\u2019s far-right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen. Both parties have over the years absorbed working-class voters who used to vote Communist. But under Salvini, the League\u2019s rise has been astronomic, whereas Le Pen has yet to hold national power, due in part to differences in the two countries\u2019 electoral systems. A year ago Le Pen was Salvini\u2019s mentor. Today he has become an exemplar for far-right politicians. The League\u2019s expansion has created some internal tensions. It governs the prosperous northern Lombardy and Veneto regions, which still want more tax autonomy, even as Salvini courts southern voters. But Salvini has done to the League what Trump has done to the Republican Party\u2014the old guard may have different priorities, but they\u2019ve been afraid to break with a leader who\u2019s so powerful and so popular among the growing rank and file. (Or at least who was until his gamble pushed his party into opposition.)\n\nSalvini\u2019s takeover of the League marked a rare generational change within an Italian political party, but one he had been preparing for his whole life. Salvini was born in Milan in 1973 to a middle-class family. His father had an office job at a chemical factory and his mother was a German-language translator. He joined the then\u2013Northern League\u2019s youth wing as a teenager, while a student at one of Milan\u2019s most prestigious public high schools. (His family wasn\u2019t very politically active and supported a small center-right government party.) Salvini left the University of Milan several exams shy of a history degree to become a Northern League activist. Despite his long political career, though, his intellectual and ideological evolution is hard to pin down. Before leaving college, Salvini had contemplated writing a thesis on the Italian industrialist Adriano Olivetti, a Catholic socialist with innovative ideas on improving society. \u201cHe said, \u2018I can\u2019t graduate, I\u2019m obsessed with politics,\u2019\u201d Giulio Sapelli, a professor of economic history at the University of Milan whom Salvini had asked to advise on the thesis he never wrote, told me. Back then, Sapelli said, he\u2019d recommend books to Salvini\u2014Paul Kennedy\u2019s The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, books by Henry Kissinger and the French philosopher Simone Weil, as well as Emmanuel Mounier\u2019s The Personalist Manifesto, a book he said Salvini \u201cappreciated a lot.\u201d Mounier founded Personalism, an anti-Marxist school of thought that valued the individual. Sapelli told me he didn\u2019t really recognize the youthful Salvini in the Salvini of today. \u201cHe\u2019s a very different person,\u201d he said. Salvini\u2019s performative talents were evident at a young age. As a teenager, he excelled as a contestant on Italian television game shows. In 1993, when he was 20, Salvini was elected to the Milan City Council with the blessing of the Northern League\u2019s cigar-chomping leader and co-founder, Umberto Bossi. (Bossi was among those charged in the party-funding scandal.) A few years later, Salvini became a journalist for La Padania, the Northern League newspaper, where he edited letters to the editor. But his real breakthrough came in 1999, when Bossi plucked him to work for Radio Padania Libera, the Northern League\u2019s rough-and-ready talk-radio station, known for its call-in programs. Here, Salvini excelled at fielding questions from (often angry) listeners.\n\n\u201cIt was a great school,\u201d Alessandro Morelli, a Salvini loyalist who ran Radio Padania after Salvini and is now a League lawmaker who was head of the Italian Parliament\u2019s transport committee in the previous government, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the only radio that lets people call up without a filter.\u201d The hosts picked the hot topics of the day and took the pulse. Salvini was a natural. To this day, he comes alive in the rapid-fire give-and-take of a press conference or a television debate. (He has also benefited enormously from the relative docility of the Italian press, which tends to focus obsessively on minor political tensions rather than the bigger picture\u2014and which tends to cozy up to power. Some of Italy\u2019s most popular television hosts and newspaper columnists aided in Salvini\u2019s ascent by writing favorably of him, flattering him or letting him talk about how he gained weight on the campaign trail rather than asking him probing questions.) As we sat in Morelli\u2019s office in Parliament\u2014he\u2019d arrived late, fresh from a meeting with Salvini at the interior ministry, he said\u2014I pressed him for anecdotes about Salvini\u2019s Radio Padania days. Surely he must have a few good stories? No, Morelli said, nothing came to mind. Really? No, really, he told me. Just that Salvini was a great leader and a great communicator. Morelli\u2019s remarks\u2014friendly and polite, yet vague\u2014fit a pattern: The League is an extremely disciplined party, especially under Salvini. When they don\u2019t talk, they don\u2019t talk. And the few who do tend to say the same thing. League members told me so often that Salvini was his own media strategist\u2014\u201cWho\u2019s Matteo Salvini\u2019s spin doctor? The answer is Matteo Salvini,\u201d Morelli told me, unprompted\u2014that it began to sound like a kind of self-incrimination. Sure, Salvini understands that cat videos and attacks on immigrants get traction online, but the more his loyalists preemptively dismissed the idea of algorithms guiding his message, the more I began to suspect that his secretive social-media machine may be even more significant than what little of it the public knows.\n\nSalvini wouldn\u2019t grant me an interview, and neither would many of the League\u2019s top officials. It and the Five Star Movement have mostly shut out the foreign press. Their brand of populism means controlling their own message. Salvini did deign to speak to Time, which put him on its cover as \u201cthe most feared man in Europe.\u201d Things weren\u2019t so different under Berlusconi, and it\u2019s not uncommon for European leaders\u2014Angela Merkel, Vladimir Putin, and Orb\u00e1n, for example\u2014to decline interviews with foreign media, but there\u2019s one difference in Italy today, with Salvini (and the Five Stars) setting the tone: No western European G7 country has ever been run by such an inward-looking government in the postwar era. Over the years, Salvini has shown consistency in a handful of areas: skepticism about the EU and the euro; anger at the perceived threat immigration poses to Italy; a belief in the traditional heteronormative family; and an admiration for autocrats. In his 2016 autobiography, Secondo Matteo (\u201cAccording to Matteo\u201d), Salvini compares the EU to a \u201c\u2018Super State\u2019 that\u2019s not that different from the old Soviet Union.\u201d Never mind that the EU never sent anyone to the gulag; Salvini captures genuine frustration in Italy with the euro. The country didn\u2019t manage the transition from the lira particularly well, with prices rising sharply compared with salaries, and to this day, many Italians blame their economic woes on the single currency.\n\nThose feelings multiplied in Italy after the European debt crisis began, sending borrowing rates soaring and toppling governments in Greece, Spain, and Italy. By the fall of 2011, Berlusconi was out of power, stepping down when Italian bond yields were so high that it looked for a minute like the country might need a bailout. He was replaced by a government of national emergency led by Mario Monti, a technocrat, which had support from both right and left. (The League was in the opposition.) Monti\u2019s government put in place austerity measures, including raising the retirement age, which the populist government had been working to reverse\u2014although where Italy would find the money is anyone\u2019s guess. Where Salvini stands on the euro remains ambiguous. The League has governed for years at the local and regional level in Italy\u2019s richest northern regions, home to businesses that have thrived under the euro, but when Salvini first took over the League, he, Morelli, and a few others drove a camper around Italy campaigning for 2014 elections for the European Parliament on a platform of \u201cBasta euro,\u201d or \u201cenough already\u201d with the euro. The effort was masterminded by Claudio Borghi, who was head of the Italian Parliament\u2019s Budget Committee until the government fell. When I met him in his palatial office in Parliament this spring, he told me leaving the euro was no longer on the table\u2014because the League governed in a coalition \u201cwhose program doesn\u2019t include leaving the euro.\u201d Salvini and other senior League officials have said they want the EU to change its rules, including the one requiring countries using the euro to keep their budget deficits under 3 percent of GDP.\n\nThis would require changing European treaties, which is a long shot. It\u2019s also too technical for most voters to comprehend. Instead, Salvini rails against what he calls a Europe run by \u201cbankers, do-gooders, and bureaucrats.\u201d And he often singles out the billionaire financier George Soros in conspiratorial tones. In Salvini\u2019s speech in Milan before European Parliament elections in May, he accused some \u201celites\u201d\u2014Merkel, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Soros\u2014of betraying Europe, and said Soros was paying NGOs to bring immigrants to Europe. Is his targeting of Soros not a classic anti-Semitic trope? I pressed Borghi on this. \u201cSalvini talks about Soros because he\u2019s a speculator, not because he\u2019s Jewish,\u201d he said. The Hungarian-born financier was indeed a currency speculator in the \u201990s, but Salvini mentions him only in the context of immigration. Here Italy seems to be following Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary: a country with few Jews but dog-whistle anti-Semitism. Salvini has long been obsessed with immigration as a negative force in Italy. When he was growing up, his family moved to a new apartment, only to find that the previous tenants refused to leave. \u201cStrange to say it, but history repeats itself: The tenant wasn\u2019t an Italian!,\u201d Salvini wrote in Secondo Matteo. (The book\u2019s title, with its clever reference to the Gospel according to Matthew, is trademark Salvini: at once grandiose and ironic about his own grandiosity. This strategy is key to his image\u2014he plays the strongman but winks at the audience. He acts tough but disarming at the same time.) In 2009, when Salvini was a member of the Milan City Council, he suggested the city consider reserving special seats on public transport for \u201cthe Milanese\u201d and for \u201cpeople with good manners\u201d\u2014the implication being that foreigners didn\u2019t meet that criteria. His critics at the time, including in the party then led by Berlusconi, said Salvini\u2019s suggestion was reminiscent of asking Jews to wear yellow stars.\n\nIn speeches and in his autobiography, Salvini more than flirts with the rhetoric of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory, most recently elaborated by the French philosopher Renaud Camus, who posits that Europe\u2019s white-majority population is being replaced by people of color. This conspiracy theory has been adopted by far-right extremists, including the perpetrators of recent mass shootings in the United States and New Zealand. Salvini has not endorsed such violence, but nor has he backed away from a theory that has motivated it. (The Italian investigative journalist Claudio Gatti has reported in a recent book that one of Salvini\u2019s closest friends in high school went on to become a leader in Forza Nuova, a neofascist group that has celebrated Salvini, and that the two men have remained friends for decades.) In 2016, Salvini went so far as to call the arrival of immigrants to Italy \u201can ethnic substitution.\u201d Salvini offers a watered-down version of this claim in Secondo Matteo. \u201cItaly today isn\u2019t undergoing a phenomenon of immigration but a real and true substitution: Our young people are leaving and being replaced by foreigners,\u201d he writes. To counter this, Salvini proposes French-style bonuses to boost the birth rate\u2014but only for families of Italian citizens. \u201cWe want to return to the joy of being able to have children without resorting to the horror of population change by means of out-of-control immigration,\u201d he argues in his book. He never misses a chance to depict the left as people who will destroy families and harm children. In just about every rally and public speech, Salvini defends the traditional family against what he sees as the threat of same-sex couples, saying, \u201ca family is a mamma and a pap\u00e0.\u201d\n\nThe League now has the governorship of Lombardy and the Veneto, and governs in a right-wing coalition in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Sardinia, the central Abruzzo region and Basilicata in the south, and has been gaining strength at the municipal level across once-left-leaning Tuscany, Umbria, and Emilia Romagna. (The latter two hold regional elections this fall.) Even if the new government has pushed the League into the opposition nationally, the party remains strong across Italy.\n\nSalvini may be a traditionalist, but he\u2019s not a moralist. He has two children from two different relationships: an elementary-school-age daughter, Mirta, and a teenage son, Federico. He constantly posts pictures of them on social media. He talks a lot about being a dad and about the challenges to staying married. (He never depicts himself as a son; his parents are all but invisible, although he does mention pearls of wisdom from his grandmother.) Salvini is now dating Francesca Verdini, a 26-year-old restauranteur whose father is a former Berlusconi ally convicted of misuse of public funds and of organizing an illegal Masonic lodge. The couple made their first public appearance this spring at the Italian premiere of Dumbo. Italian tabloid magazines\u2014popular with older women who were crucial members of Berlusconi\u2019s electorate\u2014showed Verdini doing a walk of shame the next day, wearing Salvini\u2019s clothes, an image that winds up making him seem virile.\n\nBy his own admission, Salvini has never been particularly religious, but in his efforts to court voters, especially in the south, he has taken to brandishing rosaries and crucifixes in his public appearances, an image that nationalizes his message of \u201cItalians first.\u201d It goes beyond left and right; it\u2019s about defending Christian values. This has also opened a debate in Italy about the political instrumentalization of religious symbols. (By contrast, in France, Le Pen has cast herself as a great defender of French la\u00efcit\u00e9, an insistence on the absence of religion from the public sphere.) In my quest to try to understand where to place Salvini, I paid a visit to Gennaro Sangiuliano, the head of the Italian state broadcaster RAI\u2019s Tg2 news program, which has become a crucial part of Salvini\u2019s media machine\u2014one newspaper nicknamed it \u201cTelesalvini\u201d\u2014and asked him what Salvini believed in. Sangiuliano is Neapolitan, and his discourse tends toward the baroque. Whenever I\u2019d ask about Salvini\u2019s strategy, Sangiuliano responded with long discourses on philosophers and scholars. He is the author of several books, including The Fourth Reich: How Germany Subjugated Europe, as well as biographies of Winston Churchill, Hillary Clinton, and Putin, whom he admires. At one point, Sangiuliano began a detour into American history and an (inaccurate) discourse on the origin of the word conservative, which he said came from a word for a person who in ancient tribes kept the flame alive. Then, finally, Sangiuliano answered my question. \u201cI think\u2014I think, I don\u2019t know\u2014that Salvini believes in conservative values, in the sense of returning to the old values of God, fatherland, family,\u201d he told me.\n\nThese three words have more than echoes of the pillars of fascism. And Salvini is well aware of that. In May, he gave a campaign speech from the same balcony in the city of Forl\u00ec from which Mussolini once spoke. Salvini\u2019s supporters include CasaPound, a far-right group that relishes demolishing Roma encampments on the impoverished outskirts of Rome. (It takes its name from Ezra Pound, who late in life defended Mussolini\u2019s fascist regime.) Salvini has not disowned the group\u2019s support, and has in fact made a point of ordering the bulldozing of Roma encampments. But he tends to downplay his own rhetoric by mocking it. This month, just after Parliament passed a security bill that gives the interior ministry more powers, Salvini campaigned in Sabaudia, a beach town outside Rome, in front of a fascist-era memorial to Mussolini\u2014surely a careful choice\u2014and joked that he\u2019d \u201cget in trouble\u201d for being there, saying he was surprised politicians on the left hadn\u2019t had it torn down yet. This ambiguity is at the heart of Salvini\u2019s style: He taps into admiration for Mussolini while also winking at how such admiration is transgressive. In announcing he was withdrawing from the government, he said he wanted early elections and \u201cfull powers\u201d\u2014the exact words Mussolini used in the speech that brought him to power in 1922. Salvini\u2019s defenders often dismiss concerns about his flirtation with fascist tropes as a kind of totalitarianism of the left. But Salvini\u2019s behavior is always raising this question: Is he a fascist or a \u201cso-called fascist\u201d? Italy is a democracy, but with Salvini, something new has been unfolding. Ezio Mauro, a columnist for La Repubblica, has described it as \u201cfascism 2.0.\u201d \u201cThe growing and spreading banalization of fascism that has been under way in recent decades has had as a result the erasure of history, the removal of its meaning, the weakening of its judgment,\u201d Mauro wrote. No, the tanks aren\u2019t rolling in, he wrote, but the Italian right\u2014and Salvini\u2014need to clarify where they stand in their respect for the Italian constitution, the foundation of the Italian republic created after the Second World War, which Italy began on the side of the Axis powers and ended on the side of the Allies.\n\nEven before his bare-chested beach tour, Salvini showed a soft spot for strongmen. He has professed great admiration for Trump, Orb\u00e1n, and Putin. In Secondo Matteo, Salvini dwells on Putin\u2019s visit to Milan in 2015. \u201cI have to admit there has never been anyone in my life \u2026 who mesmerizes me the way Putin does,\u201d he writes of the meeting. \u201cHis way of being, his decisive voice, his firm handshake: Everything confirmed that I was facing a real leader.\u201d The League opposes European sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Crimea, on the grounds that they hurt Italian businesses. In this, the League is not alone in Italy, but it\u2019s the only party in the country to have signed a cooperation agreement with Putin\u2019s United Russia party, which it did on Salvini\u2019s watch, in 2017. Sebastian Kurz\u2019s People\u2019s Party in Austria and Le Pen\u2019s National Rally signed similar accords with United Russia. After Le Pen\u2019s party signed the agreement, it secured a loan from a Russian bank. The League has said that no money changed hands in its agreement. Yet the relationship with Russia could damage the League\u2019s credibility. In recent months, the Italian magazine L\u2019Espresso and BuzzFeed News have published damning scoops about a meeting in Moscow last fall in which close associates of Salvini discussed an energy deal that allegedly would have diverted funds to the League ahead of European Parliament elections in May, in violation of Italian campaign-finance law. In July, BuzzFeed published audio recordings of the meeting\u2014one of the clearest signs to emerge yet of how Russia is trying to influence and destabilize European politics. There\u2019s no evidence that the energy deal happened, and Salvini and his associates have denied wrongdoing, but magistrates in Milan have opened an investigation.\n\nSalvini has refused to answer specific questions from journalists or members of Parliament. So far, the scandals haven\u2019t stuck. Berlusconi\u2019s scandals didn\u2019t stick either. The Italian electorate tends to take a pretty dim view of the ethics of politicians. Until the government changed, Salvini had always been on the offensive. Although he excels at playing the victim, mostly he forces others to debate and challenge him on his terms. He has done this by weaponizing migration as a threat. Under European law, countries must process would-be asylum seekers in the first country of arrival. Since 2014, more than half a million people\u2014asylum seekers and economic migrants\u2014have landed in Italy, a country that is home to 60 million people and is 80 percent coastline. Many of these migrants been dispersed in ill-named \u201cwelcome centers,\u201d where they are stranded for years, unable to work legally, subject to exploitation by organized-crime groups, until Italy processes their applications. This has created a powder-keg situation, especially in smaller towns unaccustomed to immigration. For Salvini, as for Trump, the rhetoric of \u201cinvasion\u201d is fundamental. Under this government, the nightly news on RAI became filled with images of dark-skinned foreigners arriving on boats on Italy\u2019s shores, as well as more coverage of crime, often committed by people of color. There has been a new focus on Nigerian organized-crime groups operating in Sicily and the Italian south, even though the territory is still controlled by Italian groups. (Italy\u2019s crime rate has dropped, though racist incidents are on the rise.)\n\nThe images of the boats arriving have persisted even though the flow of migrants to Italy dropped sharply after 2016, when the EU struck a deal with Turkey, paying it billions of euros in exchange for Ankara not permitting would-be asylum seekers to leave. The flow decreased further after Rome struck a questionable accord with Libya in 2017, in which the North African nation agreed to detain would-be migrants in camps that critics say violate the Geneva accords. \u201cThere is no invasion,\u201d Flavio di Giacomo, the spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, which tracks migration and human trafficking, told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is public opinion.\u201d In the fall of 2013, just before Salvini took over the League, there was a wave of public national solidarity after nearly 500 migrants died when their boat caught fire off the island of Lampedusa. \u201cPeople said, \u2018These poor people,\u2019 and \u2018Anyone who\u2019s lost at sea should be saved,\u2019\u201d di Giacomo said. Not so today. The day I met di Giacomo this summer, there were reports from the U.S. border with Mexico of children being separated from their families. Things were bad all over, I pointed out. \u201cYour country has antibodies,\u201d di Giacomo said. How strong were Italy\u2019s? In Italy, Salvini has mastered turning complex problems like immigration into simple images\u2014boats arriving, boats being turned away. Here he has made use of Laura Boldrini, a former spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees who was later elected to Parliament as part of a small left-wing party, eventually becoming speaker of the lower house. She has never lived down saying that she believed immigrants were a resource for Italy, and Salvini now depicts Boldrini in regular Twitter attacks as the embodiment\u2014feminized\u2014of everything wrong with how the Italian left handled immigration. At a campaign rally in 2016, Salvini held up a blow-up sex doll and said it was Boldrini, to cheers from the crowd. Ahead of the European Parliament elections in May, he hate-tweeted about her, saying that if she was voting for the center-left Democratic Party, that was just another reason to vote for the League.", "description": "Matteo Salvini is not merely a Donald Trump facsimile\u2014the Italian politician has been testing whether Facebook likes translate into votes, and is remaking his country along the way.", "authors": ["Rachel Donadio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/ItalyOpener/facebook.jpg?1567531879"}
