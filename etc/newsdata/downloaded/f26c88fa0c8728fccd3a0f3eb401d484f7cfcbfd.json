Scratch the surface, though, and it\u2019s easy to find deep disagreements about the life and legacy of this modern saint, who is often invoked to praise and condemn the pope\u2019s vision.\n\nNewman often appears in controversies concerning the role of conscience and authority in the church. Conscience has become a contested term during Francis\u2019 papacy, especially following his 2016 exhortation \u201cAmoris Laetitia.\u201d Writing about love and marriage, the pope stated: \u201cWe need a healthy dose of self-criticism.\u201d He admonished readers that \u201cwe are called to form consciences, not to replace them,\u201d a view the pope\u2019s critics say gives individuals a license to decide right and wrong for themselves without the counsel of the church and its teaching.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProgressives cite Newman in support of the pope\u2019s view of conscience. As Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of Francis, wrote on Twitter: \u201cOne cannot help but imagine that Cardinal Newman, a famous opponent of papal infallibility, would delight to be canonised on Oct 13 by a pope who admits mistakes, calls himself a sinner, dislikes being put on a pedestal, & has restored the role of conscience.\u201d\n\nBut Francis\u2019 opponents have been equally quick to invoke Newman\u2019s statements about conscience. Explaining his widely-publicized decision to call for Francis\u2019 resignation, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 told The Washington Post, \u201cI was inspired by Blessed Cardinal Newman, who said, \u201cIf I am obliged to bring religion into after-dinner toasts, I shall drink \u2014 to the pope, if you please \u2014 still, to Conscience first, and to the pope afterwards.\u201d\n\nIn addition, conservatives have looked for inspiration in Newman\u2019s comments on \u201cliberalism.\u201d Newman called liberalism \u201cfalse liberty of thought,\u201d or the attempt to find truth through reason alone independent of faith and devotion. He characterized his life as one long campaign against this view in his spiritual autobiography. Some have already invoked Newman\u2019s criticism of liberalism against the Amazon synod, which is meeting at the Vatican to advance the ecological effort Francis called for in his encyclical letter \u201cLaudato Si\u2019.\u201d Newman insisted on maintaining the unique authority of the church and its doctrine. So he is being invoked to criticize the Amazon synod for \u201cblurring the lines\u201d between Catholicism and nature worship by celebrating \u201cMother Earth,\u201d biodiversity and indigenous spirituality.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNewman\u2019s own sexuality also figures into contemporary debates. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable to think [Newman] might have been homosexual,\u201d wrote the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author who recently met with Francis to encourage greater support for LGBTQ Catholics. And in 2010, when Pope Benedict XVI beatified Newman, the decision to move Newman\u2019s remains ignited criticism from the LGBTQ community.\n\nNewman had been buried by his request in the same grave as his friend Ambrose St. John, whom Newman called \u201cmy earthly light.\u201d Although the Vatican said it planned to move Newman\u2019s remains from Rednal, England, to the Birmingham Oratory church for \u201cpublic veneration,\u201d some called the decision an attempt to cover up a same-sex relationship.\n\nIn the end, gravediggers disinterred some brass, wood, and cloth and moved them to the Birmingham Oratory. But Newman\u2019s body could not be moved; it had completely decomposed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNewman wasn\u2019t just any controversialist. He also believed that \u201cto live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often.\u201d He was sensitive to the idea that arguments and facts rarely change anyone\u2019s mind, something both scientific research and experience have confirmed in our increasingly tribal era.\n\nNewman wrote: \u201cThe heart is commonly reached, not through the reason, but through the imagination.\u201d He explained: \u201cPersons influence us, voices melt us, looks subdue us, deeds inflame us. Many a man will live and die upon a dogma: no man will be a martyr for a conclusion.\u201d His hundreds of sermons, hymns, poems and dozens of books (including two novels) attempt to reach the deeper, more imaginative sources of our most important convictions.\n\nIn Newman\u2019s most popular work, his 1865 spiritual autobiography entitled \u201cApologia Pro Vita Sua,\u201d he didn\u2019t attempt to prove his Catholic beliefs to his (mostly non-Catholic) audience. Instead, he tried to show he was sincere every step of the way as he slowly became convinced of the truth of Catholicism. Newman gained a wide variety of admirers, many of who didn\u2019t share his convictions. After reading the Apologia, famous agnostic writer George Eliot, for example, found herself surprised at \u201chow close a fellowship\u201d she felt with Newman\u2019s \u201cspiritual needs and bur[d]ens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome say Newman\u2019s richer, more literary side has the most to offer to us. For example, Stanley Hauerwas, a professor emeritus at Duke Seminary and renowned theologian, has said: \u201cThe role of a theologian is to help us recover what extraordinary and odd things we believe as Christians.\u201d He has mentioned that Newman was uniquely able to achieve this task because he was one of the best writers of his era. \u201cNewman was extraordinary\u201d Hauerwas told me, \u201cbecause he recovered a way to do theology that was as fresh as the theology of the early fathers. He never failed to write from the gut.\u201d\n\nIt seems inevitable that as Francis\u2019 papacy continues to spark controversy, the contest for Saint Newman will continue and this great controversialist will continue to be invoked by the pope\u2019s critics, as well as his advocates. We can hope that the subtler Newman will prevail and that, as with the gravediggers at Rednal, he will keep slipping through their fingers.\n\nBrett Beasley received his PhD from Loyola University Chicago and writes about the intersection of language, ethics and religion.
