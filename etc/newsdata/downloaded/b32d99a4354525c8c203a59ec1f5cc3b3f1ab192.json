In that ruling, a federal judge stated that states like Nevada without specific immigration statutes do not have the authority to hold illegal aliens in police custody for civil immigration violations.\n\n\u201cI am optimistic that this change will not hinder LVMPD\u2019s ability to fight violent crime\u201d Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said in a statement. \u201cWhile the ruling can be seen as a setback, I am determined that through cooperation with our federal partners the goal of removing the worst of the worst can still be accomplished.\u201d\n\nLombardo said the Las Vegas Metro Police Department would \u201ccontinue to work with ICE\u201d at a nearby detention center to remove violent criminal illegal aliens.\n\nThe decision to end Las Vegas\u2019s cooperation with ICE comes after the ACLU \u2014 funded by billionaire George Soros \u2014 put pressure on the police department to end their cooperation with federal immigration officials, claiming holding criminal illegal aliens on ICE detainers was a violation of the law.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, about 1-in-14 Nevada inmates are illegal aliens, with about 1,000 illegal aliens in prison for crimes in the state. Nearly half of these 1,000 illegal aliens in Nevada prisons have been convicted of violent crimes.\n\nFor example, 150 of the 1,000 illegal aliens in Nevada prisons have been convicted of murder, manslaughter, or attempted murder, as well as 320 illegal aliens who have been convicted of sexual assault, including 240 child sex offenders.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
