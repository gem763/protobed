You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSince bursting on to our screens in 2016, Zeke has the most rushing yards (4,048), most carries (868), most 100-yard rushing games (19), most 20+ carry games (28), most touches (1,003) and most runs of 20+ yards (30).\n\nQuite simply he is the most dominant, no-nonsense back and entirely worth the investment \u2013 for now at least, with rejigging in his absence almost unthinkable. Pencil in Zeke to be the NFL rushing leader for the third season in four, enabling Dallas to make a run at winning it all.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Arizona State Harry was a surprise pick by the Patriots but will boost Tom Brady Getty Images\n\nJones begins to prove doubters wrong\n\nDespite public intent suggesting otherwise, there is a very real scenario that Daniel Jones starts his first game for the New York Giants this season and even by the end of October.\n\nLoudly mocked by those around the league after New York pulled the trigger at a lofty No 6 for the former Duke QB, Jones has shown flashes of promise in pre-season.\n\nThe position he was drafted in brings pressure, yet Jones does not need to be Aaron Rodgers to make the pick worthwhile, especially alongside the astonishing Saquon Barkley. He\u2019ll simply need to better than the fallible Eli Manning. The two-time Super Bowl champion, who was aptly changing in the shadow of a reporters\u2019 huddle with Jones this pre-season, is nearing the end.\n\nA trip to the Patriots on short rest, with the Cardinals at home to follow in Week 7 could be the ideal time to make the change and commence a new era for Big Blue.\n\nMontgomery provides Bears with greater potency\n\nThe Bears profited last summer to add Khalil Mack to an already daunting defence, which shows no sign of being tamed.\n\nBut rookie David Montgomery appears destined to give Chicago a three-down presence Jordan Howard simply could not. The former Iowa State stud has elusiveness and size with a workmanlike philosophy, having incredibly asked head coach Matt Nagy how he could make the team despite the Bears being besotted with their third-round pick.\n\nHaving seemingly struck the right balance with their backs to aid Mitch Trubisky, the Bears look formidable and strong contenders to represent the NFC in Miami.\n\nSeahawks push Rams close for division\n\nWith Los Angeles suffering a hangover from firing a blank at the Super Bowl, the Seahawks look primed to sneak up on Sean McVay\u2019s electrifying Rams.\n\nAfter picking up a bargain by trading for Jadaveon Clowney, Seattle now have a frightening defense surrounding lynchpin Bobby Wagner.\n\nRussell Wilson\u2019s weapons are slim, but with Chris Carson and Rashad Penny\u2019s one-two punch on the ground, this is a team that could be primed to topple the champions of the West.\n\nBig Ben makes a run at MVP\n\nInitial panic over Antonio Brown\u2019s departure has subsided with the goodwill in Pittsburgh blossoming in the cantankerous wide receiver\u2019s absence.\n\nBen Roethlisberger snuck up on the league in 2018 to lead in passing yards (5,129) and attempts (675), with 11 per cent more than the next QB playing in the league this season (Matt Ryan threw 608 times).\n\nNarrative is often crucial when considering the MVP and with the losses of AB, Le\u2019Veon Bell (who James Conner adequately replaced already) and the league\u2019s infatuation with the Browns, seizing back the North behind another passing frenzy could build a considerable case, despite his current price at 40/1.\n\nMahomes maintains wizard status\n\nAfter becoming just the third quarterback in history to throw for 50 touchdowns, most feel Patrick Mahomes is certain to regress somewhat, but why?\n\nAt 23 years old Mahomes isn\u2019t close to his prime, has retained his weapons (largely thanks to Tyreek Hill\u2019s fortuitously escaping a ban) and will be all the better after experiencing his first full season as a starter.\n\nThat is not to say Mahomes\u2019 total number of touchdowns could not dip slightly, as the only two before him to bring up a half-century, Peyton Manning (55, 2013) and Tom Brady (50, 2007), both regressed in their next full season. Manning fell to 39 in 2014 (also falling to 28 in 2005 after putting up 49 the year before), while Brady dropped to 28 in 2009 after missing almost all of 2008 through injury.\n\nBut just watch him put up comparable numbers acros the board again after the Chiefs got even faster with the acquisitions of rookies Mecole Hardman and Darwin Thompson, while LeSean McCoy adds depth and understanding to the Andy Reid offense. Last year they posted the third most points per game (35.3) and Mahomes is fully capable of guiding them back to that number once more.\n\nBaker and OBJ combine as league\u2019s most deadly duo\n\nOdell Beckham Jr is free and in Cleveland he could not have landed in a more opportune spot. Baker Mayfield thrilled in his rookie season and revelled under Freddie Kitchens. Not only did the Browns hand Kitchens the keys, they acquired the most electrifying wide receiver in the league.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, providing OBJ can finally stay healthy.\n\nDrew Brees and Michael Thomas, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman, Matt Ryan and Julio Jones and predominantly Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill enter this conversation, but the verticality of OBJ could justify the absurd hype surrounding a team coming off a 7-8-1 season.\n\nBrady swallows ego as Pats shift focus\n\nTom Brady miraculously returns at 42, feverishly pursuing a seventh ring and a fourth successive trip to the Super Bowl with the Patriots.\n\nBut to ensure a smooth road there, Bill Belichick could flip the team\u2019s identity, knowing the weapons simply aren\u2019t there anymore for a shoot-out, with the notable absence of recently-retired Rob Gronkowski.\n\nAfter restricted the previously explosive Los Angeles Rams to three points in last year\u2019s Super Bowl, the Pats lost Trey Flowers. Admittedly that was a big blow, but Michael Bennett arrives to perhaps immediately plug that gap and inject some heat into their pass rush. While the secondary will likely continue to be a nuisance, with the tireless duo of Stephon Gilmore and Jason McCourty. Watch out, Tom and Bill aren\u2019t done yet.\n\nTunsil worth his weight in gold\n\nThe Texans, without a GM, appear to have haemorrhaged their future by trading away two more first round picks and a second to acquire left tackle Laremy Tunsil from the Dolphins. Perhaps the criticism of Houston was a little hasty though, even if they did effectively toss away the destructive Jadaveon Clowney to Seattle in a regrettable trade.\n\nBut back to Tunsil, who could chop into last season\u2019s league-high of 62 sacks allowed to ensure their generational talent Deshaun Watson remains healthy. That appears to be the key to their entire season with the Colts forcibly taking a step away from title contention due to Andrew Luck\u2019s stunning retirement. Therefore the Tunsil trade could clinch the division and a chance to capitalise on this apparant title window.\n\nSaints snap out of bitterness\n\nThe Saints were understandably bitter after a no-call on pass interference from the Rams\u2019 Nickell Robey-Coleman\u2019s hit on Tommylee Lewis denied them a Super Bowl berth. They may never forgive or forget, but attention must turn to 2019 in perhaps Drew Brees\u2019 last chance at another ring.\n\nThe veteran QB\u2019s crafty decision-making, utilising the dynamic duo of Alvin Kamara and Michael Thomas, as well as an underrated D-line who could realistically step up, should enable them to navigate their way back to the title game.\n\nHad the last two seasons been simulated over and over, the Saints most certainly would have prevailed on numerous occasions after their misfortune against both the Rams and two years ago in Minnesota, but it could be third time lucky before the inevitable big rebuild in New Orleans.", "description": "Elliott a worthy investment after all the drama Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s contract hold-out dominated much of the pre-season: A Dallas Cowboys team with so many uncertain issues moving forward potentially sacrificing a chance at the Super Bowl, while fantasy football players preceded to lose their minds over one of the most prolific players in the league feasibly depriving an owner of", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/16/Patrick-Mahomes-will-make-a-run-at-the-Super-Bowl-once-again.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
