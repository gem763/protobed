The market recovered after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed is prepared to cut rates further if necessary, says Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.\n\nPresident Trump reacted to the announcement with more criticism of the central bank, saying it had no \"guts\" and had failed again.\n\nJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nAt a news conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he views the recent rate cuts as a measured adjustment, adding, \"The U.S. economy itself -- the consumer part of it -- is in strong shape.\"\n\nBut he added, \"If the economy does turn down, a more extensive series of rate cuts could be warranted.\"\n\nWednesday\u2019s move is likely to set off a domino effect across the economy, pushing down rates for credit cards, home equity lines, adjustable-rate mortgages and auto loans. Yet it will also squeeze savers, particularly seniors and others on fixed incomes, who were just starting to benefit from higher savings account yields.\n\nMore on Fed's rate cut: Why another cut is good news for your wallet ... mostly\n\nTips for savers: How do you make more money when the Fed cuts rates?\n\nJust last year, the Fed was tapping on the economy\u2019s brakes. The two rate reductions since July mark the first in more than a decade and reverse just a tiny portion of the nine hikes the Fed approved from late 2015 through 2018.\n\nThose rate increases were designed to head off a potential spike in inflation and begin to bring rates back to normal as the halting recovery from the recession of 2007-09 finally picked up steam.\n\nPowell told reporters Wednesday that global growth has slowed further and the trade war intensified in August with new tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\n\"We do see those risks as more heightened,\" Powell said.\n\nAt the same time, some recent developments have bolstered the argument of Fed officials who believe rates should hold steady. One measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy items hit a 13-month high in August. And trade tensions have eased recently, with U.S. and Chinese officials scheduled to talk next month and each side taking symbolic steps to lessen the acrimony.\n\nKansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren dissented, preferring to keep rates unchanged. But James Bullard, head of the St. Louis Fed, dissented because he wanted to slash the Fed\u2019s key rate more sharply, by half a percentage point.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell repeatedly has said the economy is still performing well, with the 3.7% unemployment rate \u2013 near a 50-year low \u2013 fostering faster wage growth that has fueled healthy consumer spending. Consumption makes up about 70% of economic activity.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China has hurt exports and factory output and begun to raise prices for American shoppers. The conflict also has generated business uncertainty that has dampened investment. An index of manufacturing activity for August reflected contraction for the first time since 2016. And another inflation measure that the Fed monitors more closely remains stubbornly below its 2% target.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point for the second time this summer to head off a potential recession.
