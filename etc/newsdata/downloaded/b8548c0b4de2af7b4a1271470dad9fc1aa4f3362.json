While marijuana remains an illegal at the federal level as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance, cannabidiol extracts, or CBD, is completely legal in the U.S. with certain FDA restrictions. CBD is popular in health and wellness and pain management products due to the absent of THC is the products while still maintaining the benefits of cananbis.\n\nBDS Analytics has forecast the potential for the CBD market to reach $20 billion annually by 2024. The Brightfield Group sees the near-term market size based on FDA approvals and consumer adoption providing in wide outcomes. The research firm sees the potential for the U.S. CBD market to reach $21.9 billion by 2022, but the lack of FDA approval for dietary supplements and food products could reduce the market size to only $4.4 billion in four years. Either way, CBD sales are forecasted to surge from a very small $0.6 billion market size last year.\n\nA big growth area for CBD is within the sports market where athletes deal with constant pain management. In addition, some believe cannabis aides in the recovery process or improves concentration of athletes providing multiple benefits to athletes. The American Journal on Addictions says cannabis is now the second most widely used drug among athletes after alcohol while pain medication abuse is a major problem in the sports community.\n\nAny company that can build brand awareness via either athlete use or actual medical data while using major athletes as brand ambassadors could open up a large market opportunity for actual sports performance and not just recreational use.\n\nWe\u2019ve delved into three companies poised to profit from the demand for CBD products for athletes:\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC)\n\nThe major Canadian players haven\u2019t been able to invest in the U.S. marijuana markets due to the products being illegal on a federal level and companies like Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis are listed on major U.S. stock exchanges. These stock exchanges prohibit companies from listing with businesses illegal on a federal level. For this reason, the legal CBD market offers the best entry point into the U.S. market to develop name recognition for eventual approval of marijuana.\n\nFor its part, Canopy Growth made a recent acquisition of BioSteel Sports Nutrition. The company already provides sports nutrition products to 70% of the major professional teams in North America and has over 10,000 points of distribution in Canada and the U.S.\n\nVia working with the expertise of Canopy Growth, BioSteel now plans to offer future products with CBD. BioSteel already has Ezekiel Elliott, of the Dallas Cowboys, lined up as a brand ambassador of CBD products once the NFL approves the use of the substance. The company works with several other high profile athletes that would likely easily transition to supporting their CBD products.\n\nCanopy Growth will own 72% of BioSteel with a stated path to 100% ownership. The company didn\u2019t provide financials, but the deal isn\u2019t likely very material considering Canopy Growth is worth $8 billion. Regardless, the deal could provide a strong entry path into the U.S. CBD market and eventually turn into a very powerful brand in the CBD sports sector.\n\nOverall, Wall Street sizes up CGC as a \u2018Moderate Buy\u2019 stock, as the bulls edge out the cautious on the cannabis giant. In the last 3 months, CGC has received 10 bullish ratings versus 6 analysts hedging their bets. With shares down about 60% from late April highs, the consensus price target of $36.40 hints there could be upside for investors, with the stock fetching $22.67.
