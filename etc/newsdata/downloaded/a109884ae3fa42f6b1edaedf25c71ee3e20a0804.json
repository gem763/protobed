Pictured: Mr Corbyn yesterday at a wind turbine facility in Southampton\n\nJeremy Corbyn will accuse Boris Johnson of 'using the Queen' to deliver a pre-election Tory party political broadcast at next week's State Opening of Parliament.\n\nIt is believed that the Labour leader will brand Monday's Queen's Speech a 'cynical stunt'.\n\nHe is also set to insist that he is 'champing at the bit' for a general election but would only support the move if a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.\n\nSpeaking in Northampton on Thursday, Mr Corbyn is expected to say: 'On Monday, we will be treated to the farce of Boris Johnson's Conservative government, amid full pomp and ceremony, setting out an agenda to Parliament that it has no intention or means of delivering.\n\n'This Government isn't going to put any legislation before Parliament.\n\n'It has a majority of minus 45, a 100 per cent record of defeat in the Commons and is seeking a general election which will end the parliamentary session the Queen is about to open.\n\n'Holding a Queen's Speech before an election is a cynical stunt.\n\n'Johnson is using the Queen to deliver a pre-election party political broadcast for the Conservative Party.'\n\nThe Labour leader will also insist that the issue of a no-deal Brexit had to be sorted out before a general election because Mr Johnson could not be trusted.\n\nMr Corbyn will say: 'Prime Minister, we can't trust you not to break the law because you've got form.\n\n'We can't trust you not to use the period of an election campaign to drive our country off a no-deal cliff edge that will crash our economy, destroy jobs and industries, cause shortages of medicine and food and endanger peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Labour leader is set to say that the country could not trust Prime Minister Boris Johnson 'not to break the law'. Pictured: Boris Johnson welcoming European Parliament president David Sassoli to 10 Downing Street\n\n'So it's simple: obey the law, take no-deal off the table and then let's have the election.\n\n'We're ready and champing at the bit.\n\n'There's only one reason it hasn't happened yet - we can't trust you.'\n\nMr Corbyn will lay out his alternative Queen's Speech, calling it 'the most radical of modern times'.\n\nIt would include a 'final say Brexit referendum', a \u00a310-an-hour minimum wage, banning fracking, scrapping tuition fees, ending rough sleeping and free personal care and prescriptions.\n\nMr Corbyn's speech is also set to say: 'We might be just weeks away from the first Queen's Speech of a Labour government.\n\n'And in that Queen's Speech, Labour will put forward the most radical, hopeful, people-focused programme in modern times: a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country.'\n\nMr Johnson was accused of dragging the Queen into politics over his bid to suspend Parliament.\n\nThe Prime Minister was heavily criticised after a Supreme Court ruling last month found there was no 'reasonable justification' for his advice to the monarch to prorogue Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the State Opening.", "description": "The Labour leader is set to say Boris Johnson cannot be trusted 'not to break the law' but will add that he would only want a general election after a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.", "authors": ["Raven Saunt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/01/19519088-0-image-a-83_1570668757378.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
