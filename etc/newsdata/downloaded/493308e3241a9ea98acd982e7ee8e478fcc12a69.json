The British parliament didn\u2019t reject the deal, so no need to change course.\u201d\n\nAnd one diplomat took to Twitter to complain that his Sunday morning had been disrupted by British political manoeuvres.\n\nGregor Schusterschitz, Austria\u2019s deputy permanent representative to the EU, sent a picture of the meeting agenda.\n\n\u201cWhat better way at to start a Sunday morning than with a meeting on Brexit\u2026 and this in all the uncertainty yet again created by the House of Commons,\u201d he added.\n\nEuropean sources were not sure how any decision on an extension will be made. Tusk could call a special summit next week, but diplomats said he is more likely to use a written procedure.\n\nOne European diplomat suggested a summit would only be necessary if British MPs reject the deal next week and overturn the whole process. Any decision either way must be unanimous.\n\nLast week, EU and UK negotiators announced an agreement to govern Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc at the end of the month and European leaders endorsed it at a summit on Thursday.\n\nThe EU parliament will begin its own ratification procedures on Monday but Britain\u2019s House of Commons, which torpedoed an earlier agreement signed a year earlier, still has its doubts.", "description": "Brussels (AFP) \u2013 Brussels officials on Sunday pressed on with plans to ratify the divorce deal as European leaders considered Prime Minister Boris", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/58d6b3_hundreds-thousands-demonstrators-joined-an-anti-brexit-in-central-london-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
