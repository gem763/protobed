Mr. Schiff, appearing on the ABC program \u201cThis Week,\u201d said Sunday that the whistle-blower who triggered the inquiry would testify \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Schiff hinted the committee might not call Mr. Giuliani, the bombastic former New York mayor who was essentially running a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine on behalf of Mr. Trump. Interviewed on ABC shortly before Mr. Schiff, Mr. Giuliani at first said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t cooperate with Adam Schiff,\u201d then said he \u201cwill consider it.\u201d\n\nSunday night was only the latest effort by Ms. Pelosi to try to strike a dignified tone for the process with her appearance on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d In a series of interviews, she has been making the case that Mr. Trump engaged in \u201ca cover-up,\u201d calling this moment a \u201csad day for our country.\u201d\n\nBut the carefully coordinated messaging campaign may be upended before it starts. Liberals, are reveling in news of an inquiry that they believe should have been opened long ago. The campaign of Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, whose profane cry for impeachment made news on her first day in office, is already selling T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan using a two-letter abbreviation for the expletive she used back in January.\n\nAnd on the presidential campaign trail, Democrats are talking up impeachment, which poses a danger that the public will think the party is prejudging the outcome of the inquiry and politicizing a solemn task that has grave implications for the future of the nation.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure this is fact-driven and evidence-based, \u201c said Representative Josh Gottheimer, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey who had resisted calls for the inquiry until now. \u201cYou can\u2019t prejudge something that is so solemn and obviously could have a big historical impact on our country, and you need to keep the country together.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, three congressional committees issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, demanding that he produce documents and a slate of witnesses that could shed light on Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to pursue investigations into his political opponents, including Mr. Biden.", "description": "\u201cOur tone must be prayerful, respectful, solemn, worthy of the Constitution,\u201d the House speaker privately told her colleagues as Democrats planned more subpoenas, including to Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/28/us/politics/28DC-DEMOCRATS/28DC-DEMOCRATS-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
