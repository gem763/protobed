I eventually moved it down to $7,797 before moving it again to $7,878. I will also provide a deeper discussion of why I moved the stop numerous times.\n\nRisk / reward: Target 1 = 4.38, Target 2 = 9.7 Target 3 = 17.16 based on first entry at $7,940\n\nEntry idea\n\nThe chart for my original set up is included below. For reference, I wrote up the entire trade in the journal entry. The basic reasoning for the trade was the clear hidden bullish divergence with the relative strength index (RSI) and the bounce off of the bottom of the ascending channel. The risk to reward for a long position also satisfied all my conditions to enter a trade at the time.\n\nBTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThis trade went my way initially but reversed rather quickly. I posted the idea on twitter and one of my followers pointed out that, in his opinion, my stop loss was set a bit too tight. I considered his opinion, recalculated, and based on my position size, was still well within my calculated risk to move my stop loss down slightly.\n\nI moved the stop to $7,797 and as shown below, I was quite lucky with this decision. Price wicked down below my initial stop loss before reversing to re-enter the ascending channel. Instead of being stopped out, I doubled my long position at $7,900.\n\nBTC USD 4-hour chart.

This further convinced me that Bitcoin was likely to bounce from the bottom of the ascending channel.\n\nBTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin bounced nicely and made a move towards the first target, the equilibrium (EQ) of the ascending channel. However, the price stalled below the EQ, and on a final push up to $8,350 created a long wick and an ugly candle. This is shown as the last candle on the chart below. At this point, I exited half of the position at $8,200.\n\nBTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe remainder of the position I held but moved my stop up to reflect the rising price and ascending support of the channel. Pictured below are the stop losses that I moved. I finally settled at $7,878 for the stop, which is where the remaining 50% of my position closed at a loss. In retrospect, I should have been far more aggressive with my stop, moving it into profit.\n\nBTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHow it worked out\n\n3.2% gain on the first half of the position ($7,940 - $8200). 0.27% loss on the back half of the position ($7,900 - $7,878).\n\nPart 2: Setting up my new Bitcoin trade\n\nEntry: $7,390\n\nAfter a significant break down from the bear flag on Oct. 23, Bitcoin price approached a buy order that I had set in June 2019. There was no rational reason for me to remove this order as doing so would be an emotional decision based on the recent drop. I filled my bids at $7,390 in the highlighted zone below.\n\nThis also amounted to an almost perfect 61.8% retrace of the entire move from the $3,100 bottom to the $13,800 top, considered by many to be an ideal entry. I consider this a long term position that I am building and used money from my sideline USD (I keep 15% of my crypto portfolio in dollars for investing on the dips), not from my trading account. That said, I presently have orders lower in case of further depreciation and have not set targets or a stop loss.\n\nXBT USD daily chart.

These divergences have now been confirmed from all time frames below the 12-hour chart. I am still awaiting confirmation of a bullish divergence on the daily time frame.\n\nBTC USD daily chart.

This would be a 1% trading portfolio loss.\n\nEntry idea\n\nI set alarms on Ankr Network (ANKR) for a potential break of the major descending resistance shown on the chart below. My idea was to enter on a retest of this line. I was not watching when the retest occurred but I saw a potential bullish divergence forming on the RSI.\n\nThis divergence was confirmed on Sept. 26, so I entered the trade at .00000025 sats. I immediately set a stop loss at .00000022 sats to provide a bit of breathing room below the recent low where the divergence was confirmed. I set take profit targets at the purple lines shown below.\n\nANKR BTC daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHow it worked out\n\nI\u2019m very happy that I set my take profit orders in advance. This coin was pumped and subsequently dumped within a day but my sell orders were filled for 70% of the position. I sold 35% at .00000035 sats and 35% at .00000040 sats. These were 40% and 60% gains. My stop is still set at .00000022 sats for the remaining 30% of the position.\n\nANKR BTC daily chart.
