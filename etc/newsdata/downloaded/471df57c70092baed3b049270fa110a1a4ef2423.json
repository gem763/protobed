I think it's like the Holy Grail of the entertainment industry,\u201d Shakira told Zane Lowe in an interview on Apple Music\u2019s \u201cBeats 1\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cIt's a sports event, but it has a huge relevance for us artists, and I think it's going to be fantastic. And, I'm going to be celebrating my birthday with 100 million people. A small party. It's surreal.\u201d\n\nThe mother-of-two revealed that Jay-Z personally called her to extend the offer of performing with Lopez on the NFL\u2019s biggest night \u2013 which his entertainment and management company Roc Nation is producing.\n\n\u201cHe called me and he asked me if I wanted to be a part of that. And, of course, I didn't hesitate,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018Of course, count on me.\u2019 And, he mentioned that Jennifer was also involved, and I feel that it's going to be great because she also represents a really important part of the Latino community who lives in the U.S., and who has been born and raised in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cWaka Waka\u201d songstress said she feels as though she\u2019s responsible for opening the world\u2019s eyes to other parts of the Latin world \u2013 many of whose people have migrated to the United States in search of better lives.\n\nJAY-Z TALKS NFL PARTNERSHIP, COLIN KAEPERNICK AND SUPER BOWL 2020 HALFTIME PERFORMERS\n\n\u201cAnd, I think, in a way, I feel that I'm representing another part of the Latin world, which is all those people around the globe who almost barely speak English,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd, a huge portion of the demographic that also arrived in the U.S. and live the American dream. I think this is going to be an event to celebrate Latin culture and the importance of women also in the industry.\u201d\n\nThe three-time Grammy-winner said she isn\u2019t sure what to expect from the performance but noted that she has already begun to obsess over the production, even though it has been less than a month since she and the Bronx-born Lopez were announced as co-headliners.\n\n\u201cVery short, therefore very nerve-wracking,\u201d said Shakira of what she anticipates the show will be like. \u201cI can't stop thinking of ideas. Every day I have a new idea. And so now, it's a matter of making them all work together and having the time to consolidate all of that and present the best show of my career.\u201d\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ GIVES POLE-DANCING LESSON IN 'HUSTLERS' SCENE\n\nAs the \u201cHips Don\u2019t Lie\u201d singer prepares for the performance, Shakira will also release a concert-film documentary in November that sheds light on how she pressed on during her 2018 \u201cEl Dorado Tour,\u201d which saw the Latina bombshell postpone her tour after sustaining a hemorrhage to her vocal cord.\n\n\u201cFor a second I thought that I was never going to be able to sing again,\u201d she said of the harrowing ordeal. \u201cActually, for a few months, it was one of the most difficult things I've ever experienced in my life. I visited so many doctors and they all said that I had to have surgery. That there was no other way to recover my voice other than surgery. Surgery was obviously very risky. So you can only imagine the nightmare that it was.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe pop superstar continued: \u201cI couldn't speak to my children. I had to remain doing vocal rest for long periods of time. A miracle happened. I didn't require any surgery. It's a happy ending to my story and the story of this tour.\n\n\u201cSo, to be able to have all of this in a document that is going to tell people the story of how it all happened and how it all came together as well and the process, the creative process and the bittersweet battle of bringing this to the audiences, I think it's going to be fantastic.\u201d", "description": "Shakira was given\u00a0the ultimate birthday gift when she was asked to perform alongside Jennifer Lopez at Super Bowl LIV on Feb. 2 of next year, her 43rd birthday.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/shakira-jlo-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
