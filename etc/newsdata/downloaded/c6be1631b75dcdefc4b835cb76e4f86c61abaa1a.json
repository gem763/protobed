His frustrated mother, Diandra Luker, was furious when she found a bag of marijuana among the film star's possessions.\n\n'Do you know what this is Cameron?' she asked him. 'Your father is using drugs.'\n\nLuker also told him his father was having an affair in the same year and he began to cry himself to sleep and binge eat.\n\nBy 13 when he was shipped off to boarding school, Cameron says he tried marijuana and felt for the first time the 'pressure lift' and found it as a 'path out of his loneliness'.\n\n'One thing after another, one thing after another. Just caught up in himself. It was an 18 year nightmare,' his father Michael Douglas recalled.\n\nCameron Douglas, 40, says his life spiraled when he learned his father Michael Douglas, 75, was cheating on his mother Diandra Luker\n\nThe 40-year-old opened up on his dark chapter of life with ABC News' Diane Sawyer on Tuesday night along with his actor father Michael Douglas, 75, who admitted 'I did not think that you were going to make it' on Cameron's decades of drug abuse.\n\nCameron was seven when his mother told him Michael was cheating on her which caused him to binge eat and cry himself to sleep. Michael, Diandra and Cameron pictured above\n\nBy 13 when he was shipped off to boarding school, Cameron says he tried marijuana and felt for the first time the 'pressure lift' and found it as a 'path out of his loneliness'\n\nCameron's drug use got him kicked out of school and quickly escalated to cocaine and heroin. At one point he was so desperate to get high he\u2019d shoot cocaine into his neck and rib cage.\n\n'At one point you do your rib cage?' Sawyer asked, to which Cameron nodded in reply: 'My rib cage, my neck\u2026'\n\nCameron told Sawyer: 'I thought that I was not put together properly and since that was the case, I was just going to take it as far as I could take it.'\n\nMichael Douglas was 34 when his son was born and said didn't realize the pressure the long shadow of the Douglas paternal lineage would feel.\n\nAt first Michael and his acting legend father Kirk, now 102, tried to rescue him by agreeing he could star in movie It Runs in the Family alongside the pair if he got clean.\n\nLater on, problems got so bad between the father and son that Michael hired two people to kidnap Cameron and take him to rehab but the addict got so aggressive that the mission was called off.\n\nCameron revealed that he and his father didn't speak for 'quite a while' after that.\n\n'I think I was so angry because I was so angry at myself,' Cameron opened up.\n\nIn the emotional chat with Sawyer, Michael told his son: 'You were either going to kill somebody or you were going to kill yourself.'\n\n'We reached a point where I was going to lose him, based on everything I'd seen, and I was not willing to emotionally commit anymore,' Michael opened up.\n\nCameron told Sawyer it was 'heartbreaking' to have to ask his father 'don't you love me anymore' after he was cut off. However Michael explained his thinking.\n\nCameron recalls one interaction with Michael (pictured together in 2009) where he explicitly told him it was impossible to develop a relationship with him. \u2018I think you\u2019re going to overdose, or someone\u2019s going to kill you, or you\u2019re going to kill someone. I\u2019m trying to prepare myself emotionally,\u2019 Michael reportedly said to him\n\n'At what point do you protect yourself or other loved ones around you before you get dragged in and it falls apart?' Michael asked Sawyer.\n\nIn his book, Cameron wrote how his father made him hand out joints to celebrity party guests when he was a child before he became hooked on heroin.\n\n'Even as a really young kid, I remember running joints back and forth,' Cameron said of his dad's parties, which regularly featured a bevy of stars including the likes of Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito.\n\n'Dad would say, 'Hey, bring this over to your uncle,' and I would, not realizing until years later what it had been. As I got older, I would creep from house to house on the compound, climbing balconies and seeing more than I was supposed to: beautiful grown-ups doing the things that beautiful grown-ups living lives of excess do.'\n\nCameron would then wait for dawn to descend and for his dad's famous friends to retire to their rooms before rifling through their bags, minesweeping any substances they'd left behind.\n\nIt was after such parties that Cameron remember his dad would always take him for early morning breakfasts at a hotel in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nBut it was only years later the true reason behind the father-son moments \u2013 which were otherwise fleeting \u2013 became clear: Cameron realized his father was coming down from drugs after a long night of partying.\n\nThe memoir reveals how Hollywood legend Michael had been so preoccupied with partying during his time atop the upper echelons of tinsel town that he hired a busboy to act as a 'more constant male influence' for his young son so he could avoid the responsibility.\n\n'My career was first. My career came before my family. My marriage was not great. I should've focused more on my family but that's hard to say when you're in the midst of a career when in your own mind you're stepping out of your father's shadow, trying to create a life of your own,' Michael confessed.\n\nIn his new book, Long Way Home, Cameron Douglas (left) admits he may have been born into Hollywood royalty, but his life has been anything but a fairy-tale. The son of Michael Douglas (right), 75, and the grandson of silver-screen legend, Kirk Douglas, 102, Cameron reveals the difficulties he grappled with growing up in the long shadow cast by his paternal lineage\n\nDuring a lunch with Cameron's mother, Diandra, at the Ivy in Beverly Hills, Michael identified a busboy hovering near their table as the ideal candidate.\n\n'Dad said, 'What about this guy? He seems very capable. He could be a houseman or something like that.' Mom spoke to him in Spanish . . . he was from El Salvador,' Cameron writes. 'Soon [he] was living with us. He took care of me from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep.'\n\nBut Cameron says he was left heartbroken at aged 10 when the busboy-come-makeshift father figure was fired after Diandra found vodka bottles under his bed and asked him to stop drinking, but he refused.\n\nA few years later, Cameron had to contend with the difficult news his father had checked into rehab for sex addiction after Diandra caught him in bed with another woman.\n\nCameron says his mother gave Michael an ultimatum that he had to 'deal with his drug and alcohol intake' or she would leave him. Two weeks later he checked into the Sierra Tuscon clinic in Arizona.\n\nBut his infidelity continued, and Diandra reached breaking point in 1995, when a private investigator caught him entering the Beverly Wilshire hotel with another woman.\n\nBut his parent's broken marriage did little to solidify more of a union with his father. In fact, Cameron recalls one interaction with Michael where he explicitly told him it was impossible to develop a relationship with him.\n\nCameron's drug use got him kicked out of school and quickly escalated to cocaine and heroin. At one point he was so desperate to get high he\u2019d shoot cocaine into his neck and rib cage.\n\nCameron pictured at a table with a joint in his hand. In his new book Long Way Home he says he started to abuse drugs at the age of 13 with marijuana, which escalated into snorting cocaine at 15, sampling crystal meth at 17, doing liquid cocaine by 19 and heroin at 26\n\nHe confessed he struggled to live in the shadow of his Hollywood scion father Michael and grandfather Kirk Douglas, 102, and grew up watching their ritzy, partying lifestyle\n\nThough he makes clear in the book he blames only himself for the squandering of his privileged beginnings, Cameron was exposed to the partying scene from an early age\n\nMichael eventually divorced Cameron's mother in 2000 after 23 years of marriage and married actress Catherine Zeta Jones.\n\nHe said after years of watching his son fruitlessly go in and out of rehab centers, he was forced to give him an ultimatum.\n\n'You're my son and I love you but I think you're going to die,\u2019 Douglas said one day after reaching his wit\u2019s end.\n\n'I was not willing to emotionally commit anymore,' Douglas recalled saying. Cameron replied: 'Do you not love me anymore, dad?'\n\nDouglas then limited his son's money, leading him to turn to robbing local stores with a Glock in hand. He called robbing an elderly woman for chump change of $20 the 'lowest point' of his life.\n\nCameron eventually turned to dealing crystal meth disguised as bath salts in gift baskets and ended up raking in thousands.\n\nHe sold crystal meth for a year in a half until he was busted in 2009 in a sting operation in the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan, where he later pleaded guilty to heroin possession and conspiracy to distribute drugs.\n\nHe was originally sentenced to five years in prison, but in 2011, Cameron was issued an additional four-and-a-half years for possession of contraband that tested positive for cocaine and heroin.\n\nHe ended up spending in total seven years behind bars in federal prison - two in solitary confinement. But he says it was prison where he joined addict support groups and started meditating, that turned his life around.\n\n'It was getting away from addiction and allowing me to see things more clearly and then the constant love and support of my family \u2013 never giving up on me,' Cameron said.\n\nHis frustrated mother, Diandra Luker, was furious when she found a bag of marijuana among the film star's possessions.

The son of Michael Douglas (right), 75, and the grandson of silver-screen legend, Kirk Douglas, 102, Cameron reveals the difficulties he grappled with growing up in the long shadow cast by his paternal lineage\n\nHe received a rude awakening in jail when he learned his father was diagnosed with stage four throat cancer.\n\n'And I've never seen somebody's body change so drastically. I mean, it's a real -- it's a real fight for your life,' Cameron said when his father visited him following his chemotherapy.\n\nBut despite the uncountable ups-and-downs, Cameron can remember the elation he felt when he was visited by his father and Kirk, who he calls \u2018Pappy\u2019, at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan before his sentencing in 2009.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so impressed by Pappy, and touched. He\u2019s ninety-three, and he\u2019s come all the way from California to see me,\u2019 Cameron writes, adding Kirk told him \u2018That\u2019s my boy\u2019, when he informed him he\u2019d been emerging victorious in a number of prison fights.\n\nDuring his seven years behind bars, Cameron got a large tattoo of his father and grandfather on his torso, in an ode to overcoming the conflictions he felt growing up in their shadows.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never been able to overcome my conflicting feelings about my last name, my pride in it and at the same time, my discomfort with having it define how other people see me,\u2019 he writes.\n\n\u2018When I get their faces tattooed on my body, I feel ready, finally, to show an uncomplicated pride in them. When I show the tattoo to Dad, he seems embarrassed.\u2019\n\nOn June 13, 2016 he finally left prison vowing to never turn back to his old ways. He moved into a halfway house in the Bronx before later moving into an apartment in TriBeca with his yoga instructor girlfriend, Viviane Thibes.\n\nHe pays testament to his father\u2019s second wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, for \u2018pushing [Michael] to extend his paternal love to me.\n\n\u2018One day, we\u2019re hanging out and [my dad] says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you did it. How you went through the things you did.\u201d It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever acknowledged it quite like that,\u2019 Cameron says.\n\nIn December 2017, Cameron became a father himself when Viviane gave birth to their first daughter together, Lua Izzy Douglas.\n\nThey live in Hollywood Hills where Cameron is now pursuing a career as an actor and working to rebuild a relationship with his family.\n\nHe's taking acting classes and has some movie parts but is still on probation. He proudly notes that he takes regular drug tests that have shown no trace of cocaine or meth for the past five years.\n\nClosing out the interview Cameron asked a final question to his father saying: 'I wonder if you truly didn't think I was going to make it out or if you held on to a bit of hope that I was going to pull through.'\n\n'Yes. Hope, yes. But no, I did not think you were - I did not think you were going to make it,' Michael admitted, his eyes shining with emotion.", "description": "Cameron Douglas revealed his life spiraled when he was just seven after he discovered his Hollywood giant father was cheating on his mother, leading him to get hooked on drugs.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/04/20067400-0-image-a-71_1571802569408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
