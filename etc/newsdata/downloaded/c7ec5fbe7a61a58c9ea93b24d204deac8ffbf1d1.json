In the days before the call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400m in military aid for Ukraine - prompting speculation that he was holding out the money as leverage for information on Biden. Trump has denied that charge but acknowledged he blocked the funds, later released.\n\nThe Trump-Ukraine phone call is part of the whistle-blower's complaint that was released this week.\n\nTrump has blasted the inquiry as \"Witch Hunt garbage\" and said he has done nothing wrong.\n\nAs a formal impeachment inquiry in the House gets under way, here are all the latest updates:\n\nTuesday, October 1\n\nPompeo in Europe as impeachment simmers at home\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo opened a four-nation tour of Europe on Tuesday in Italy, as the push to impeach President Donald Trump gains steam at home.\n\nPompeo arrived in Rome just hours after US officials confirmed his participation in Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president that is fueling the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. Pompeo is the first Cabinet official known to have heard Trump press the Ukrainian leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son for corruption.\n\nPompeo didn't speak to the issue during an exchange of pleasantries with reporters aboard his plane but has said previously that he does not believe any State Department official acted inappropriately in contacts with Ukraine's government.\n\nBarr travelled to Italy last week with US Attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Barr and Durham met with government officials as part of the investigation, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\n\nPompeo is set to meet Italy's president and prime minister on Tuesday but is not due to speak publicly until Wednesday when he addresses a conference on faith-based organisations at the Vatican and later is scheduled to hold a news conference with Italy's foreign minister.\n\nFrom Italy, Pompeo will travel to Montenegro and North Macedonia before wrapping up his European trip in Greece.\n\nPompeo was on Trump-Ukraine call, officials say\n\nTwo US officials said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the July 25 call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine's president that is at the center of a whistle-blower complaint.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal matter.\n\nIt was the first confirmation that a Cabinet official was on the call in which Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden's membership on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nIt also increases the number of people known to have first-hand knowledge of a call that has sparked an impeachment inquiry by Congress.\n\nThe State Department had no comment.\n\nMonday, September 30\n\nTrump pressed Australian PM to help in probe of Mueller inquiry origins: NYT\n\nTrump urged Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison during a recent phone call to help the US attorney general in an investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing two US officials with knowledge of the call.\n\nThe White House restricted access to the call's transcript to a small group of presidential aides, one of the officials said, according to the newspaper.\n\nIt was an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the heart of a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into Trump, the paper said.\n\nThe original FBI probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election was launched after the bureau received a tip-off from Australian officials.\n\nTrump lawyer Giuliani subpoenaed for documents in impeachment probe\n\nHouse committees subpoena Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani for documents related to Ukraine.\n\nMcConnell: 'No choice' but to take up impeachment after House\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would have \"no choice\" but to take up any House-approved impeachment articles against Trump.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican told CNBC on Monday that the Senate rules required him to do so.\n\n\"I would have no choice but to take it up,\" under Senate rules, said McConnell.\n\nHouse Democrats are pushing for quick action on their probe into a transcript and whistle-blower complaint that Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate Joe Biden's family. If the House approves articles of impeachment, they would go to the Senate for trial.\n\nRepublican outraged after Trump tweets civil war comments\n\nTrump tweeted a conservative pastor's comment that removing him would provoke a \"civil war-like fracture\" in America.\n\nRepresentative Adam Kinzinger, a former Air Force pilot who represents an Illinois district Trump won in 2016, tweeted on Sunday, \"I have visited nations ravaged by civil war .... I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\"\n\nThat came after Trump tweeted a comment from the Robert Jeffress, pastor of the Southern Baptist megachurch First Baptist Dallas.\n\n\"If the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, it will cause a civil war-like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal,\" Jeffress said on Sunday on Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends Weekend. Trump posted his tweet a few hours later.\n\nWhat Trump appears to not know about treason\n\nTrump on Monday was thundering through a new round of counter-punches against his opponents by hammering home the suggestion that they should be arrested and charged with treason and could launch a civil war - or a combination of those.\n\nHis top foes were the whistle-blower whose complaint launched the House's impeachment investigation and the congressman leading it, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\n\"Arrest for Treason?\" Trump tweeted of Schiff on Monday, in one of many suggestions that his opponents should be investigated for operating under their constitutional duties and within the law.\n\nBut treason is extremely narrowly defined, both in the nation's founding document and in federal law.\n\nThe Constitution states: \"Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\"\n\nNote the word \"only\u201d. Treason occurs when a US citizen, or a non-citizen on US territory, wages war against the country or provides material support, not just sympathy, to a declared enemy of the United States.\n\nKremlin says Trump-Putin calls can only be disclosed with Russian consent\n\nThe Kremlin said that Washington would need Russian consent to publish transcripts of phone calls between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.\n\nCongress is determined to get access to Trump's calls with Putin and other world leaders, the US House Intelligence Committee's chairman said on Sunday, citing concerns that the Republican president may have jeopardised national security.\n\nAsked about those comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Russia would be prepared to discuss the issue with Washington if it sent Moscow a signal, but that such disclosures were not normal diplomatic practice.\n\nTrump suggests intel chairman's arrest for 'treason'\n\nTrump on Monday escalated his attacks against the politician leading the impeachment inquiry against him, suggesting that Representative Adam Schiff be arrested for \"treason\".\n\n\"Rep Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?\" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.\n\nSchiff has previously responded to the allegations he made up the conversation, saying his account was \"meant to be at least part, in parody\".\n\nUkraine's president says Kiev unlikely to publish Trump call transcript\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky said on Monday that Kiev was unlikely to publish its version of a transcript of a July 25 phone call with Trump, at the heart of an impeachment inquiry in Washington, DC.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at an event at a military site near Kiev on Monday, Zelenskiy said he felt it would be wrong to share the Ukrainian summary or transcript of the call.\n\n\"Prior to the presidency I was never a diplomat, but I think I have had many such conversations in my life and will have many more,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"There are certain nuances and things which I think it would be incorrect, even, to publish,\" he said.\n\nZelensky: We can\u2019t be commanded to do anything\n\nAsked whether Kiev would open an investigation into the claims against Joe Biden and his son Hunter, per Trump's request, Zelensky said Kiev would not act solely on the orders of other countries.\n\n\"We can't be commanded to do anything. We are an independent country,\" Zelensky said.\n\n\"We are open, we are ready to investigate (but) it has nothing to do with me. Our independent law enforcement agencies are ready to investigate any case in which the law was broken.\"\n\nSunday, September 29\n\n'Serious concerns' for whistle-blower's safety\n\nOn Saturday, the whistle-blower's legal team sent a letter to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, expressing their \"serious concerns\" for the safety of their client after Trump's attacks on their client.\n\nTrump has likened the whistle-blower and White House officials who gave information to the whistle-blower to spies and suggested they committed treason.\n\nThe letter, which was made public on Sunday, also said that \"certain individuals\" had put out a $50,000 award for information relating to the whistle-blower's identity.\n\nSaturday, September 28\n\nTrump to supporters: 'Our country is at stake like never before'\n\nLambasting the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, Trump has warned his supporters that the US \"is at stake like never before\".\n\nIn a video message on Twitter, Trump said Democrats \"want to take away your guns, they want to take away your health care, they want to take away your vote, they want to take away your freedom.\"\n\n\"We can never let this happen,\" he said. \"Because our country is at stake like never before. It's all very simple. They're trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you - and I'll never let that happen.\"\n\nThey are trying to stop ME, because I am fighting for YOU! pic.twitter.com/xiw4jtjkNl \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 28, 2019\n\nWhite House restricted access to Putin, Saudi transcripts: Report\n\nThe White House restricted access to the transcripts of Trump's calls containing sensitive conversations with both his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, according to a media report.\n\nFollowing the practice put in place after previous leaks, the documents were concealed in the ultra-secure computer system accessible with only the highest security access, The New York Times reported late on Friday, citing current and former officials.\n\n\"The Saudi calls placed in the restricted system were with King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Prince Khalid bin Salman, who at the time was the Saudi ambassador to the United States,\" the report said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nFriday, September 27\n\nTrump's envoy for Ukraine resigns amid controversy: Reports\n\nTrump's special representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, resigned on Friday, US media reported.\n\nKurt Volker speaks during an interview with Reuters in Kiev, Ukraine [File: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters]\n\nA whistle-blower complaint from within the intelligence community, released publicly on Thursday, described Volker as trying to \"contain the damage\" from efforts by Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats.\n\nVolker, who had served in the position on a part-time, unpaid basis since 2017, had sought to help Ukraine's government resolve its confrontation with Russia-sponsored separatists.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nVolker's resignation was first reported by The State Press, a student-run publication at Arizona State University, which backs a think-tank where Volker serves as executive director.\n\nRead more here.\n\nUS House panel to hear from inspector general on whistle-blower complaint\n\nA House committee will hear closed-door testimony from the intelligence community's inspector general on October 4, a congressional official said on Friday.\n\nThe hearing before the House Intelligence Committee relates to the whistle-blower report alleging Trump abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 US election for his political benefit.\n\nThe inspector general, Michael Atkinson, a Trump appointee, determined that the whistle-blower's report was credible.\n\nAtkinson was also concerned that Trump potentially exposed himself to \"serious national security and counter-intelligence risks\" when he pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son during a July 25 phone call, according to a Justice Department legal opinion.\n\nHouse panel subpoenas Pompeo for Ukraine documents\n\nThree Democratic-led US House of Representatives Committees announced a subpoena on Friday for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, seeking to compel him to hand over documents concerning contact with the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees also scheduled depositions for five State Department officials over the next two weeks, including former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, Ambassador Kurt Volker, the US special representative for Ukraine, and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union.\n\nTrump advertisement claims Dems trying to 'steal' election\n\nTrump accused Democrats of trying to \"steal\" the 2020 election in a new television advertisement, as he fends off an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.\n\nThe advertisement also attacked Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, highlighting his efforts to make US aid to Ukraine contingent on that country firing its chief prosecutor. The advertisement claims that the fired prosecutor was investigating the former vice president's son.\n\nIn fact, the prosecutor had failed to pursue any major anti-corruption investigations, leaving Ukraine's international donors deeply frustrated. In pressing for the prosecutor's removal, Biden was representing the official position of the US government, which was shared by other Western allies and many in Ukraine.\n\nTrump's re-election campaign said the new advertisement is the subject of a $10m buy, with $2m coming from the Republican National Committee.\n\nBrad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, says, \"This is a Joe Biden scandal and the Democrats are trying to use it to steal the election.\"\n\nConway: Trump is the most 'battle-tested person I know'\n\nWhite House Counsellor Kellyanne Conway dismissed a question of whether the White House was organising an impeachment war room, saying the president is \"the most battle-tested person I've ever met\".\n\nUS House could kick off impeachment hearings next week: CNN\n\nThe US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee could open hearings as early as next week in its impeachment inquiry into President Trump, CNN reported on Friday, citing an interview with the panel's chairman.\n\n\"We will move as expeditiously as possible,\" Adam Schiff said, according to the broadcaster. \"But we have to see what witnesses are going to make themselves available and what witnesses are going to require compulsion.\"\n\nSchiff said subpoenas could be issued and depositions taken as early as next week, CNN reported.\n\nWhite House lawyers directed sealing of phone transcript\n\nThe White House on Friday confirmed a key detail in the intelligence whistle-blower's complaint alleging that Trump abused the power of his office.\n\nA senior administration official acknowledged to the Associated Press that the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy was moved to a highly-classified system maintained by the National Security Council at the direction of lawyers. The motivation and timing of the move remained unclear.\n\nWhite House attorneys were made aware of concerns about Trump's comments on the call before the intelligence community whistle-blower sent his allegations to the inspector general.\n\nBiden: Let's be clear Trump is trying to hijack this election\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden tweeted on Friday, \"Let's be clear, President Trump is trying to hijack this election.\"\n\nHe added, \"This isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue.\"\n\nLet's be clear, President Trump is trying to hijack this election.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. pic.twitter.com/me7g8R0h72 \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 27, 2019\n\nHouse defeats Republican measure disapproving of impeachment inquiry\n\nThe Democratic-led US House of Representatives killed a Republican resolution on Friday disapproving of the formal impeachment inquiry into Trump Pelosi announced this week.\n\nThe vote was 222-184, largely along party lines, in favour of a motion to table the resolution introduced by Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader.\n\nThe introduction of the resolution, and the vote, underscore the deep partisan divide in the House over the effort to investigate the Republican president.\n\nBernie Sanders: Trump is 'spoiled brat'\n\nBernie Sanders, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, says Trump is a \"spoiled brat\".\n\n\"He grew up as a very rich kid,\" Sanders tweet. \"And now he thinks he can do anything he wants. Most people work hard, they tell the truth, they pay their taxes. Trump does the opposite.\"\n\nDonald Trump is a spoiled brat.\n\n\n\nHe grew up as a very rich kid.

We condemn the president's attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistle-blower, and all whistle-blowers. Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistle-blower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.\"\n\nUS spy officials were forthcoming in testimony: Senate panel chair\n\nThe top US spy official and the inspector general for intelligence agencies \"were extremely forthcoming\" in closed-door testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday on a whistle-blower complaint against Trump, the panel's chairman said.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and Inspector General Michael Atkinson \"were extremely forthcoming with us today, extremely helpful at trying to fill in some of the things that we haven't been able to pick up just from the published documents\".\n\nSchiff: President's comments invite 'violence against witnesses'\n\nResponding to reports that US President Trump likened the whistle-blower's sources \"to a spy\" and said, \"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart?\", the House intelligence chair said Americans should denounce such witness intimidation.\n\n\"The President's suggestion that those involved in the whistleblower complaint should be dealt with as 'we used to do' for 'spies and treason' is a reprehensible invitation to violence against witnesses in our investigation. All Americans must denounce such witness intimidation,\" Adam Schiff tweeted.\n\nThe President's suggestion that those involved in the whisteblower complaint should be dealt with as \"we used to do\" for \"spies and treason\" is a reprehensible invitation to violence against witnesses in our investigation.\n\n\n\nAll Americans must denounce such witness intimidation. https://t.co/cTQQXdbGsa \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 26, 2019\n\nWhistle-blower is a CIA officer detailed to White House: NYT\n\nThe whistle-blower who filed a complaint against President Trump was a CIA officer who was detailed to work at the White House at some point, according to the New York Times, who site three people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe newspaper said that the man has since returned to the CIA.\n\nLawyers for the whistle-blower declined to confirm the New York Times reporting, the newspaper said.\n\n\"Any decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistle-blower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm's way,\" said Andrew Bakaj, his lead counsel. \"The whistle-blower has a right to anonymity.\"\n\nDean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, defended the newspaper's decision to publish the information, saying, \"The role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country - whether the president of the United States abused power and whether the White House covered it up.\"\n\nTrump seeks whistle-blower sources, mentions treason: reports\n\nPresident Trump told staff from the US mission to the United Nations on Thursday he wanted to know who provided information to a whistle-blower on his phone call with Ukraine's president, likening them to a spy, two newspapers reported.\n\n\"I want to know who's the person who gave the whistle-blower the information because that's close to a spy,\" Trump was quoted as saying by the New York Times and Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart?
