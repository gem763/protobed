The Conservative Party has detailed some of its major promises, and a full platform is expected to be released by midweek.\n\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) has produced reports on many of the campaign commitments from at least four of the major parties, documenting just how much each of the promises will cost federal coffers if they are enacted.\n\nHere's a reminder of some of the major promises from each of the four main parties vying for votes in English Canada.\n\nLiberal Party and the middle class\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau is looking to build on his oft-cited slogan that his party is focused on improving the lives of the \"middle class and those working hard to join it.\"\n\nTo accomplish that, the Liberal platform includes a tax cut by raising the basic personal exemption limit over the next four years until the first $15,000 of income is tax-free for most Canadians, which will save the average taxpayer roughly $292 a year.\n\nFor new parents, the Liberal party is promising to make all maternity and parental employment insurance (EI) benefits tax-free at source. They will also make the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) more generous in the first year of a child's life.\n\nFor students, the Liberal plan includes a boost to post-secondary grants so that they're worth up to $1,200 more a year.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau waves to supporters as he boards his campaign bus in Richmond Hill, Ont., on Oct. 1. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press)\n\nFor seniors, the Liberals are promising to increase Old Age Security payments for those 75 years and older and enhance Canada Pension Plan (CPP) survivor benefits for single seniors.\n\nThey've also pledged $6 billion in new spending for health care with the goal of giving every person in this country access to a family doctor.\n\nFor workers, the Liberal plan includes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 an hour and a new Career Insurance Benefit that will supplement existing EI payments when someone loses their job.\n\nThey've also promised to make the First-Time Home Buyers Incentive more easily accessible for people living in Toronto, Vancouver and Victoria.\n\nOn the environment, the Liberal party has promised to plant 2 billion trees and to invest all the tax revenues resulting from the Trans Mountain Expansion Project in green and clean technology initiatives. They are also promising up to $40,000 in interest-free loans so people can renovate their homes to make them more energy efficient.\n\nIf the Liberals are re-elected, they are promising motorists will see 5,000 new electric vehicle charging stations along the Trans Canada highway.\n\nConservative Party promises tax breaks\n\nThe Conservative Party is promising to make life more affordable through a series of tax cuts and tax credits at a time when employment levels are high and yet many people feel like they aren't benefiting.\n\n\"It's time for you to get ahead,\" is the party's slogan.To accomplish that, the party is promising a universal tax cut that will cost federal coffers about $6 billion a year in foregone revenue. The cut will be broad-based and save virtually every taxpayer hundreds of dollars each year by lowering the tax rate on taxable income under $47,630 to 13.75 per cent from 15 per cent.\n\nBased on the party's calculations, the average single taxpayer would save about $444 a year. A two-income couple earning an average salary would save about $850 a year.\n\nFederal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer makes a campaign announcement in Saint John, N.B. (Frank Gunn/Canadian Press)\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer is also promising to renew tax credits that were put in place by the Conservative government of Stephen Harper and then killed by the Liberal government in the last Parliament.\n\nScheer would reinstate the federal tax credit for transit passes, which, according to party estimates, would save a family of four transit users in the Greater Toronto Area nearly $1,000 a year.\n\nHe would also bring back the children's fitness tax credit and the children's arts tax credit to help offset the costs associated with programs for kids.\n\nThe Conservatives have promised a non-refundable tax credit on maternity and parental leave Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. They've also vowed to remove the federal GST from sales of home heating fuels.\n\nTo make the dream of home ownership more affordable, Scheer has promised 30-year amortization on mortgages for first-time home buyers \u2014 a longer loan period that could lead to smaller payments up front \u2014 and he's promised to review the \"stress test\" that has made it more difficult for some would-be borrowers to get financing.\n\nOn the environmental front, Scheer has said he'd scrap the carbon tax and encourage industries to innovate so that they can lower emissions. \"Technology, not taxes,\" is the Conservative Party's message on the environment.\n\nScheer has also said he'll give tax credits worth up to $3,800 a year over the next two years to Canadians who spend their own money to complete green-friendly home renovations, such as replacing windows and doors, installing solar panels or upgrading ventilation.\n\nNDP promises pharmacare, dental coverage\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has promised \"a new deal for the people,\" a plan he says will close gaps in the country's social safety net to help those families who are struggling the most.\n\nAmong his proposals is a plan to institute national pharmacare, a multibillion-dollar plan that the party says will save families more than $500 a year.\n\nWhile the Liberals have committed funds for some sort of pharmacare solution down the line, Singh has said an NDP government would bring about such a drug plan right away, in 2020.\n\nSingh is also promising to expand medicare to include dental services.\n\nA New Democrat government led by Singh would also create 500,000 units of affordable housing in the next 10 years.\n\nAnd, to ensure even more affordable housing units are built, Singh has promised to waive the federal portion of the GST/HST on the construction of new rental units.\n\nSingh has also said an NDP government would spend $10 billion over the next four years to create 500,000 new child-care spaces in Canada.\n\nOn climate change, Singh is promising to kill the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and effectively give provinces a veto on major natural resources projects that move through their jurisdictions.\n\nHe's also promised large-scale building retrofits in all sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the country's housing stock. Singh has set a target of retrofitting all homes in Canada by 2050 through low-interest loans.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh takes part in The National Presents: Face to Face With the Federal Party Leaders \u2014 a broadcast event giving undecided voters a chance to speak one-on-one with the federal party leaders. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nTo pay for this ambitious agenda, the party has promised to raise taxes on the wealthy. The party would slap a \"wealth tax\" on people who earn $20 million annually. It also would raise corporate taxes, end fossil fuel subsidies, close tax loopholes and, like the Liberals, levy a foreign home buyers tax.\n\nGreens focus on major changes\n\nThe environment is, naturally, front and centre in the Green Party platform. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is proposing a fundamental reordering of Canadian society.\n\nCentral to the Green plan are measures to address the \"climate emergency\" \u2014 a 20-step action plan called Mission: Possible.\n\nThe platform offers a vision of a Canada in 2030 where homes and businesses are all powered by renewable energy, all new vehicles and public transit and passenger ferries are electric and most food is locally sourced.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May joins climate change activists and students as they gather in Calgary for a protest and \"die-in\", on the steps of the Calgary Municipal Building in Calgary on Friday, Sept. 20, 2019. (Dave Chidley/Canadian Press)\n\nThe platform says a Green government would pass into law a Climate Change Act that would require a 60-per-cent cut in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030, doubling the current 30 per cent target.\n\nNo new pipelines, or coal, oil or gas drilling or mining, including offshore wells, would be approved under a Green government. The party is also promising to ban all gas-powered \u2014 internal combustion engine \u2014 cars by 2030.\n\nThe Green Party is also promising to institute national pharmacare, a promise it says will cost some $27 billion a year.\n\nThe Green plan also proposes eliminating tuition fees by offering $10 billion in post-secondary and trade school support so that all Canadian college and university students can go to school without paying any fees.\n\nTo pay for the promises, the Green Party has said it would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies worth several billion dollars annually, including those for liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil and gas projects and coal mining exploration and development.\n\nThe Greens are also promising to impose a financial transactions tax of 0.5 per cent to collect nearly $18 billion in 2024-2025.", "description": "With\u00a0two weeks left in this federal election campaign \u2014 and with only a few days until the advance\u00a0polls open\u00a0\u2014 undecided voters\u00a0will soon have to make up their minds as to whom they'll vote for on Oct. 21.", "authors": ["Parliamentary Bureau", "John Paul", "J.P.", "Tasker Is A Reporter In The Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau In Ottawa.
