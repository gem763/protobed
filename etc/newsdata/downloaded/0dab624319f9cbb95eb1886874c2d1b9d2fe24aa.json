Prepare the trunk: before installation, saw off the bottom 3cm of the trunk to create a fresh cut that opens up the pores in the bark. If these pores are blocked, water cannot be absorbed, and the tree is likely to dry out faster than expected. Of course, Pines and Needles do this to all of their trees. 2. Trees need routine: do not expose the tree to sudden changes in temperature as they prefer steady conditions. 3. Keep it away from any heat sources: Christmas trees should be positioned away from heat sources, including radiators and fireplaces. Trees dry out faster in heat and so displaying it in a cooler place will maintain the freshness of the tree. 4. Water the tree: place your tree in plain water within a Christmas Tree stand. The water will keep the pores open and the stand will hold your tree up straight. 5. Then keep watering: top up your tree every day, as it is likely to drink up to 2-3 pints (1-2 litres) of water per day, depending on its size and your central heating settings. If the water runs out, the pores will close and prevent any future water from being absorbed, even after a refill.\n\nHowever such a high quality service doesn't come cheap.
