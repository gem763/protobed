Pompeo at one point asked an aide if reaching out to Giuliani and asking him to tone it down was an option. It\u2019s unclear if Pompeo or other senior officials from the department have communicated with Giuliani since the publication earlier this week of a bombshell whistleblower complaint about Team Trump\u2019s Ukraine squeeze.\n\nPompeo is hardly the first member of Team Trump to be vexed by Giuliani. Even before this latest saga unfolded, there certainly hasn\u2019t been a shortage in this White House of senior staffers who privately bash Giuliani as a liability for Trump and his administration. However, some senior White House officials have actively avoided criticizing or declined to even try to rein in Giuliani for fear of upsetting the president. One senior Trump aide described the president\u2019s confidant and personal attorney as both a \u201cwild man\u201d and a \u201cprotected\u201d person in Trumpworld, due to his close relationship with the president, who he more-or-less successfully defended during the two-year, high-stakes Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cPompeo realizes Giuliani is a dangerous wild card and what he did is not good for our foreign policy. But he has the president\u2019s ear. You\u2019re not going to see [Pompeo] publicly slam Giuliani because he has a tight relationship with Trump,\u201d one former State Department official told The Daily Beast.", "description": "", "authors": ["Banco", "Thedailybeast.Com Mike-Pompeo-Grapples-For-Ways-To-Outlast-Hurricane-Rudy"], "top_image": ""}
