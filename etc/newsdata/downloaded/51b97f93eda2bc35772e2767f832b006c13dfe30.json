Legendary filmmaker Scorsese launched the whole thing when he criticized the genre as something closer to an theme park ride than cinema.\n\n\u201cTheaters have become amusement parks. That is all fine and good but don\u2019t invade everything else in that sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is fine and good for those who enjoy that type of film and, by the way, knowing what goes into them now, I admire what they do. It\u2019s not my kind of thing, it simply is not. It\u2019s creating another kind of audience that thinks cinema is that.\u201d\n\nOscar-winner Francis Ford Coppola quickly piled on by wondering how \u201canyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again.\u201d\n\n\u201cMartin was kind when he said it\u2019s not cinema. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is,\u201d Coppola added.\n\nIndie director Ken Loach did not hold back: \u201cIt\u2019s about making a commodity which will make a profit for a big corporation \u2013 they\u2019re a cynical exercise. They\u2019re a market exercise, and it has nothing to do with the art of cinema.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking to the Wall Street Journal in California on Tuesday, Iger (Disney owns Marvel) responded by name-checking Scorsese and Coppola and thumping them over the head with the ole\u2019 race card:\n\nI\u2019m puzzled by it. If they want to bitch about movies, it\u2019s certainly their right\u2026 It seems so disrespectful to all the people that work on those [Marvel] films who are working just as hard as the people who work on their films. \u2026 Are you telling me Ryan Coogler making \u2018Black Panther\u2019 is somehow doing something that is less than what Marty Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola has ever done on any one of their movies?\n\n\u201cThere I said it,\u201d he added.\n\nHow sad is that?\n\nBob Iger had to know the question was coming, which means he had all kinds of time to prepare a legitimate answer, but all he could come up with was to basically accuse Scorsese and Coppola of racism for not being all that impressed with Black Panther\u2026?\n\nWhat\u2019s especially outrageous and unfair is that Coppola and Scorsese were criticizing a franchise and genre that is predominantly white \u2014 a genre filled with almost all white stars, all white producers, and all white directors.\n\nThis is not just a disgusting movie on Iger\u2019s part, it reveals his own inability to make a case honestly, to use the language of film and cinema to defend Marvel as film and cinema, as something other than a formulaic amusement park ride you forget about as soon as you hit the parking lot.\n\nDisney has made exactly one \u2014 one! \u2014 Marvel movie with a black lead, I am talking about one some two dozen titles\u2026. But it\u2019s Scorsese and Coppola who are the bigots.\n\nIf I worked for Marvel, if I were producer Kevin Feige or Robert Downey Jr., or James Gunn, or Joss Whedon, Iger\u2019s pathetic and inane defense would humiliate me: Seriously, Bob, you\u2019re playing the race card instead of supporting the actual work?\n\n\n\nHow about making an actual case, Mr. Iger\u2026???\n\nHow about explaining to us why we will still be watching Marvel movies in a hundred years. We know we will still be watching Coppola and Scorsese movies in a hundred years, movies that feel just as necessary and vital today as they did a half-century ago, so make your own case for Iron Man and Thor and Endgame and Captain Marvel.\n\nOr, is RACIST! all you got \u2014 which is an abhorrent way to respond to a couple of guys guilty of nothing more than sharing a personal opinion.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
