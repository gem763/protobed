The rapper arrived at Paris Fashion Week in an outfit consisting of literal head-to-toe floral print: a belted coat, pleated skirt, gloves, and tights, complete with a matching mask and a hood that disguised her hair and face. No one could guess that it was Cardi hiding underneath the surreal ensemble, which is by British fashion designer Richard Quinn. That was, until she spoke, and a familiar cackle was heard from all.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 baby?\u201d Cardi says in an Instagram video announcing her presence at PFW. \u201cI heard you bitches were missing me at Fashion Week New York. I\u2019m here to serve it to you motherfuckers, and serve it to you cold,\u201d Cardi warns, as she walks down a street in front of the Eiffel Towel. \u201cYou bitches could really never,\u201d she says, adding, \u201cmake sure a car don\u2019t hit me, \u2019cause a bitch can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nShe looks like a high-fashion superhero. This, to, me is the perfect disguise to wear when you want to go incognito on a Taco Bell run.\n\nPhoto: Beretta/Sims/Shutterstock/Beretta/Sims/Shutterstock\n\nThe look was debuted during Quinn\u2019s fall 2019 collection show at London Fashion Week this past February, and was also worn by Karlie Kloss and photographed by Steven Meisel for British Vogue.\n\nLater, Cardi wore a seemingly more subdued look for Thom Browne\u2019s show: glasses, a gray blazer, and a pencil skirt. However, upon a second glance, both the blazer and skirt have an exaggerated, bubblelike silhouette.\n\nPhoto: Christian Vierig/GC Images\n\nCan\u2019t wait to see what else Cardi wears this week.\n\nStay in touch.
