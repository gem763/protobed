That\u2019s his first Champions League goal and hopefully we will see many more and performances like this.\u201d\n\nAbraham\u2019s recent performances will be hard to ignore for England boss Gareth Southgate, who is set to name his squad on Thursday for this month\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Bulgaria.\n\nDespite making two senior appearances for the national team in friendly matches two years ago, Abraham is eligible to play for Nigeria and the forward said he was still undecided about his international future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a privilege to be wanted by both nations,\u201d Abraham told the BBC. \u201cI love both nations and... I\u2019m clearly doing something right for Chelsea. My time will come.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t made a decision yet. I\u2019m focussing on the club. I\u2019m from an area where I have grown up with different culture backgrounds. I\u2019m fully aware Nigeria is a massive country.\u201d", "description": "Chelsea manager Frank Lampard backed Tammy Abraham to continue his superb form and remain above the senior forwards in the pecking order after the striker opened his Champions League account in Wednesday's 2-1 victory at Lille.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436507160&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF92089"}
