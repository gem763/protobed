Kamala Harris (D-CA) described President Donald Trump as being \u201clike a two-year-old with a machine gun\u201d when using Twitter.\n\nDefending her repeated calls for Trump to be banned from Twitter, Harris said, \u201cAsk the whistle-blower. Ask members of the United States Congress. Ask the people who are prepared to testify about this president\u2019s lawlessness and obstruction of justice. Ask the people and the families in El Paso when that shooter admitted in his manifesto that he was influenced by Donald Trump\u2019s tweets. Donald Trump has 65 million followers on Twitter, and we are to take seriously that the weaponization of this platform by the president and the need therefore of a private corporation to be held accountable to say he has abused the terms. And it could result literally in the threat to safety of human beings who are participating in the process of justice.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cAre speech does not condone or protect threats to the safety of other human beings. and so that is what we are talking about.\n\nShe added, \u201cThe fact is that he is irresponsible. He is erratic. He does not \u2014he is like a two-year-old with a machine gun. Right? He doesn\u2019t understand the power of his words or his actions in way that they will actually impact and could end other human beings\u2019 lives. So whether he understands it or not, look, he is the president of the United States. I don\u2019t actually care where he understands it or not. Because he is he has shown that he is not responsible enough to self-regulate. He has shown he is not responsible enough to edit what he says.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "During Tuesday's post-Democratic debate coverage on MSNBC, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
