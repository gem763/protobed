This time, he was quizzed on Trump's teams theory of immunity from prosecution or being forced to comply with requests for documents as part of a probe.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's lawyers appealed a federal judge's ruling on Trump's tax return information to the full 2nd Circuit Court of appeals. Lawyer William Consovoy said Trump could shoot someone on the street and not face prosecution while in office\n\n'What\u2019s your view on the 5th avenue example?' Judge Denny Chin asked him. 'Local authorities couldn\u2019t investigate, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it?'\n\nConsovoy responded: 'Once a president is removed from office, any local authority \u2013 this is not a permanent immunity,' Consovoy responded, making the point that the 73-year-old president could face prosecution at the end of his term.\n\n'Well I\u2019m talking about while in office,' the judge pressed. 'That's the [hypothetical question].\n\n'No,' Consovoy responded.\n\n'Nothing could be done. That\u2019s your position?' Judge Chin followed up.\n\n'That is correct,' Consovoy replied, in an exchange that can be heard on audio.\n\nTrump lawyer William Consovoy said the president couldn't be prosecuted while in office even if he shot someone\n\nCyrus Vance Jr., Manhattan New York district attorney, has subpoenaed eight years of Trump tax returns. Vance has reached an agreement with lawyers for President Trump not to enforce a subpoena to force the release of President Trump's tax returns following an appeals court ruling\n\n'Even gathering documents that could be used later? Once the president leaves office, that can\u2019t be done either?' the judge wanted to know.\n\nThen Consovoy hedged: 'That can be done, I apologize. I meant to say with respect to the president, directly or through his custodians. This grand jury is proceeding. We have not sought to enjoin the entirety for the grand jury,' he said, in reference to the DA's probe of potential campaign finance or other violations.\n\nJudge Denny Chin\n\n'We are just saying criminal process issued to a sitting president in which they have not ruled out that he is a target of an investigation falls comfortably with the immunity that I think has to be accepted.' But Consovoy, an attorney at Consovoy McCarthy, did not back down from his argument that the president could not be prosecuted for carrying out a shooting while in office.\n\nTrump said in 2016: 'I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cy Vance has reached an agreement not to enforce a subpoena to force the release of President Trump's tax returns until days after an Appeals Court rules to allow time for a speedy appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe arrangement with President Trump's lawyers could quickly send the matter to the Supreme Court in the heat of the election.\n\nA federal judge in New York ruled this month that an accounting firm must turn over eight years of tax returns and comply with a subpoena as part of an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office.", "description": "A lawyer for President Trump said the president would be immune from prosecution if he shot someone on the street in New York during legal arguments Wednesday.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/17/20091712-0-image-a-15_1571849655065.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
