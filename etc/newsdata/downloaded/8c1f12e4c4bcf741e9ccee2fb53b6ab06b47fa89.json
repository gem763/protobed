When Ben discovers that she\u2019s back, he\u2019s overjoyed.\n\nHowever, in spite of his joy at seeing Paul\u2019s (Jonny Labey) nan, he feels incredibly awkward about Callum and thus \u2014 when in Pam\u2019s company \u2014 he plays down just who he is. Naturally, Callum\u2019s upset.\n\nLater in the week, Jay decides that it\u2019s time for him to step down from his position at Coker and Mitchell\u2019s and \u2014 when Ben finds out about Jay\u2019s plans \u2014 he seizes the opportunity to help Callum earn some extra cash \u2014 by taking Jay\u2019s job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen later reveals his plan to Callum, but he doesn\u2019t quite get the reaction he was hoping for.\n\nBen and Pam bond later in the week, and Pam ends up encouraging Ben to seize life and informs him that he should be happy with Callum.\n\nAfterwards, Ben can\u2019t stop thinking about Pam\u2019s words, and thus he takes it upon himself to make a big gesture to Callum.\n\nThe question is: what is this gesture?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, how will Callum react? He\u2019s upset about the brush-off in front of Pam, but will Ben\u2019s actions be enough to make up for it?\n\nOne to watch: Friday 8th November at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "After a heart-to-heart with Pam, Ben comes up with a way to show Callum what he means to him.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18841294-high-914d_1572307071.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
