It launched a cross-border offensive against them on Oct. 9 after Trump ordered U.S. forces out of northeast Syria.\n\nThe deal agreed with Putin, which builds on and widens a previous U.S.-brokered ceasefire, helped end the fighting.\n\nBut the SDF said in its statement on Thursday that Turkish forces had attacked three villages \"outside the area of the ceasefire process,\" forcing thousands of civilians to flee.\n\n\"Despite our forces' commitment to the ceasefire decision and the withdrawal of our forces from the entire ceasefire area, the Turkish state and the terrorist factions allied to it are still violating the ceasefire process,\" it said.\n\n\"Our forces are still clashing,\" it said, urging the United States to intervene to halt the renewed fighting.\n\nTurkey's Defense Ministry did not comment directly on the SDF report but said five of its military personnel had been wounded in an attack by the YPG militia around the border town of Ras al Ain, near where the three villages are located.\n\nTurkey previously said it reserved the right to self-defense against any militants who remain in the area despite the truce, a pledge repeated by Erdogan on Thursday.\n\n\"If these terrorists don't pull back and continue their provocations, we will implement our plans for a (new) offensive there,\" he said in a speech to local administrators.\n\nSeparately, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, told Reuters the ceasefire seemed to be holding \"by and large\" as major powers gather in Geneva ahead of the first meeting of Syria's Constitutional Committee next week.\n\nRussia, which as a close ally of President Bashar al-Assad has emerged as the key geopolitical player in Syria, has begun deploying military police near the Turkish border as part of the deal agreed on Tuesday in the Russian city of Sochi.\n\n\"We note with satisfaction that the agreements reached in Sochi are being implemented,\" Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin as saying.\n\n\"Everything is being implemented,\" he said.\n\nRIA, citing an SDF official, said the Kurdish fighters had already withdrawn to 32 km (20 miles) away from the border. It also said the Kurds were ready to discuss joining the Syrian army once the crisis in Syria had been settled politically.\n\nRussia will send a further 276 military police officers and 33 units of military hardware to Syria in a week, RIA news agency cited a Defense Ministry source as saying. It also quoted Russia's Defense Ministry as saying Russian military police had patrolled along a new 60-km (37-mile) route on the border.\n\nNext Tuesday, under the terms of the Sochi deal, Russian and Turkish forces will start to patrol a 10-km (6-mile) strip of land in northeast Syria where U.S. troops had been deployed for years along with their former Kurdish allies.\n\nThe arrival of the Russian police marks a shift in the regional balance of power just two weeks after Trump began pulling out U.S. forces, a move criticized in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of the Americans' former Kurdish allies.\n\nTurkey's military operation was also widely condemned by its NATO allies, which said it was causing a fresh humanitarian crisis in Syria's eight-year conflict and could let Islamic State prisoners held by the YPG escape and regroup.\n\nThe Russian deployments have also further highlighted increasingly close ties between Russia and NATO member Turkey.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking in Brussels on Thursday ahead of a NATO meeting, said Turkey - which annoyed Washington this year by buying Russian-made S400 missile defense systems - was moving in the wrong direction.\n\n\"We see them spinning closer to Russia's orbit than in the Western orbit and I think that is unfortunate,\" Esper said.\n\nDespite Trump's lifting of sanctions on Turkey, distrust persists between Ankara and Washington, and a top Erdogan aide on Thursday criticized U.S. politicians for treating SDF commander Mazloum Kobani as a \"legitimate political figure.\"\n\nThe aide, Fahrettin Altun, told Reuters that Mazloum was a senior leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency in southeast Turkey and which Ankara's Western allies also deem a terrorist group.\n\nRepublican and Democratic U.S. senators urged the State Department on Wednesday to quickly provide a visa to Mazloum so he can visit the United States to discuss the situation in Syria.\n\nThe Turkish public has shown strong support for the military operation, encouraged by an overwhelmingly pro-government media.\n\n\"The super-power of peace, Turkey,\" said the main headline in Thursday's edition of the pro-government Sabah newspaper.\n\nThe incursion has deepened a sense of alienation, however, among Turkey's Kurds, which is also being fueled by a crackdown on the country's main pro-Kurdish party.\n\nKurds make up some 18% of Turkey's 82 million people.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accused Turkey on Thursday of launching a large land offensive targeting three villages in northeast Syria despite a truce, but Russia said a peace plan hammered out this week was going ahead smoothly.
