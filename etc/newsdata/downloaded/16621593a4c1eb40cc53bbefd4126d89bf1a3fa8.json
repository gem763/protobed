Tough break for #Nats. \u2014 Brian McNally (@bmcnally14) October 28, 2019\n\nVictor Robles threw his helmet and gloves towards HP umpire Lance Barksdale after he rung him up on a high strike. Barksdale signaled at him (Robles will probably be fined.) Davey Martinez going crazy in the dugout. pic.twitter.com/c7H4KiFWpG \u2014 Marly Rivera (@MarlyRiveraESPN) October 28, 2019\n\nThe call, which came on a 3-2 count, ended the inning for the Nationals - the first where their bats had started to show signs of life with a Juan Soto solo home run.\n\nOn the broadcast, fans could be heard audibly heckling Barksdale. And on Twitter, there was a large cry for some help from robo-officiating.\n\nStory continues\n\nHP ump Lance Barksdale does his bit to improve MLB by moving the sport just a little closer to electronic ball-strike calls by ringing up Robles on 3-2 pitch which is two ball-widths outside. Would've been 2 on, 2 out, tying run at bat for Nats in 7th. (Fans chant \"Lock HIM up.\") \u2014 Thomas Boswell (@ThomasBoswellWP) October 28, 2019\n\nHere's your \"Strike 3\" call on Robles - you can see why he, Davey and every #Nats fan was upset @Nationals #WorldSeries #outsidethebox pic.twitter.com/2Ta5EgWIFS \u2014 Steve Chenevey FOX5 (@stevechenevey) October 28, 2019\n\nGerrit Cole got a high and outside strike 3 call. Victor Robles was justifiably mad. Nationals fans are justifiably booing. \u2014 Stephen Whyno (@SWhyno) October 28, 2019\n\nUmpires should never be the story, part of the story or even mentioned in the story. Yet on the biggest stage at the most important time Lance Barksdale inserted himself into the narrative \u2014 F.P. Santangelo SR (@FightinHydrant) October 28, 2019\n\nIt wasn't the first time in Game 5 that Martinez was visibly frustrated with Barksdale.\n\nUmp doesn't call strike three. Tells Gomes he was taking off on him. Gomes replies 'Oh it's my fault?\"\n\n\n\nThen Martinez kindly asks the up to wake up because its the World Series. pic.twitter.com/iRUr349bQh\n\n\n\n\u2014 Jomboy (@Jomboy_) October 28, 2019\n\nMORE NATIONALS NEWS:\n\nFans, Nationals livid after blown call ends 7th inning originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington", "description": "The boos were audible on the broadcast after Robles was called out.", "authors": ["Nbc Sports Washington"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/USBT3VTxXvhrfyWb4FU9RA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MTguOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/me6aX4NNyQg4fCBLpV_GFg--~B/aD05OTY7dz0xNzcyO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnwashington.com/ee5fe40d99b2e9c7324a697d2f6bcf77", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
