Here's the presentation Google is using to steal Facebook's advertisers.", "language": "en", "text": "Since May, Google has been pitching advertisers on an ad format that looks like social media posts.\n\nGoogle used a webinar to show agencies the format that's aimed at social platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.\n\nGoogle is encouraging advertisers to repurpose creative from Facebook campaigns to use in Google ads.\n\nGoogle also showed how it uses its audience data to target ads to groups of people such as those who are in the market to buy things.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nGoogle unveiled Discovery Ads at its annual Google Marketing Live event in May.\n\nThe ad format is akin to a social media ad that uses images to grab people's attention while scrolling on three Google properties: the Discover news feed in Google's app, YouTube's homepage, and Gmail.\n\nTwo ad agencies who have run Discovery Ads campaigns for clients since May said the ads use Google's audience data to target people who are in market to buy something or have recently visited a website. The focus on feeds also shows how Google is trying to make more money from areas outside of search advertising.\n\nRead more: Google is pitching an ad format that copies Facebook, and some search-obsessed agencies are starting to see the first results from it\n\nSara Ulrich, paid search strategist at Tinuiti, said the ad agency has run six or seven Discovery campaigns over the past six months.\n\nGoogle has only made the format available to certain advertisers. A spokesperson wouldn't say how many advertisers have used it or if it would become more widely available.\n\nOn Oct. 16, ad agency Tinuiti hosted a webinar about Discovery Ads with two Google execs: Amy Hemmati, a product manager; and Max Hagler, a global product lead.\n\nHere are Google's slides that show how it is pitching the ad format to advertisers. A slide at the end from Tinuiti shows the agency's results using Discovery Ads.\n\nDiscovery Ads target people when they aren't searching for products or topics\n\nGoogle's core business is keyword-based search ads that target people based on what they're looking for. Discovery Ads are aimed at people who aren't in search mode. With Discovery Ads, Google recommends advertisers think about ads that promote broader goals like brand awareness.\n\n\"We all know that people come to Google to find information and to get things done,\" Hemmati said. \"But consumers have also told us that they turn to Google sites and apps when they don't have a specific goal in mind, sometimes they're simply looking to be inspired, learn or just be entertained.\"\n\nGoogle is pitching its massive reach\n\nWith Google's reach across YouTube, search, and Google Maps, it can give advertisers a deep understanding of people's intent. Discovery Ads target \"hundreds of millions\" of people.\n\nGoogle says that advertisers can repurpose social campaigns on Google\n\nCreative is a big part of Google's Discovery Ads pitch. The ads can be a single-image post or a carousel post with up to 10 photos. Google is also encouraging advertisers to repurpose their existing social ads on Google.\n\n\"The rule of thumb is to talk to the social teams or use the Facebook scan features in AdWords to bring in creative from social,\" Hemmati said. \"We've seen customers be very successful simply lifting and shifting social creative.\"\n\nShe also recommended advertisers avoid click bait and misleading copy and use copy that prompts consumers to go to a website or buy a product.\n\nGoogle\n\nA few weeks into a campaign, Hemmati recommended that advertisers start looking at results to see which creative is performing best.\n\nAd targeting is based on Google's lucrative audiences \u2014 like people who are looking to buy a car\n\nDiscovery Ads are targeted based on data like life events, interests, and demographic information including income, employment, and relationship status.\n\nHemmati said that advertisers have seen good results using the ads to retarget people based on their search results using its custom intent targeting option.\n\nGoogle claims that it is more effective than social platforms\n\nA case study for mattress brand Nectar was used as an example of how Google Discovery ads have lower acquisition costs than other social ads.\n\nThe ads featured images from an existing social campaign and promoted free trials, deliveries and warranties.\n\nCarousel ads convert better than static images, according to Tinuiti's research\n\nTinuiti also presented the results it's had using Discovery Ads for clients. A chart showed carousel ads performed better than those with one photo.", "description": "During a webinar with ad agency Tinuiti on Wednesday, Google presented an in-depth look at its pitch to grab ad dollars from social platforms.", "authors": ["Lauren Johnson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da79e374af9094b910cbdb5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
