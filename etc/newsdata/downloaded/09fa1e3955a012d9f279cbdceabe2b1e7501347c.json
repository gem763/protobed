Tulsi Gabbard at the Presidential Gun Sense Forum in Des Moines, Iowa, August 10, 2019. (Gage Skidmore)\n\nHer military service and independent streak give her the edge over increasingly paranoid Russophobes such as Hillary Clinton.\n\nSome years ago, a liberal-minded friend of mine complained during lunch that Fox News was \u201cstealing\u201d his elderly parents. \u201cThey should be enjoying retirement,\u201d he said, noting that they live in a modest but comfortable style with attentive children and grandchildren to enjoy. \u201cBut instead,\u201d he sighed, \u201cthey keep this channel on all day, and it makes them anxious and agitated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI thought of this exchange last week when Hillary Clinton gave an interview in which she accused socialist Jill Stein, President Donald Trump, and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of being in various ways compromised or controlled by the Kremlin. That is, I started to wonder whether Hillary Clinton is the victim of a kind of media elder abuse. Is the broader media ecosphere of \u201cthe resistance\u201d her daily source of paranoia? The ladies of The View have tried to validate her conspiratorial gibbering \u2014 the hosts this week spoke of Gabbard as a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d candidate. Is Clinton talking to John Brennan too much?\n\nJust a few years ago, Clinton\u2019s own memoir of her time at the State Department gave the impression that she was a mostly uneducated na\u00eff, a historically illiterate New York Times reader trying to understand global politics. There was ignorance to spare, but no hint of conspiratorial madness. Why did the intervention in Libya go so wrong? Back then, she just shrugged. \u201cWould the country\u2019s future be shaped by the arms of its militias or the aspirations of its people?\u201d Clinton wrote, with all the insight of a failed opinion columnist for a college newspaper.\n\nBut something darker has come upon her imagination lately. \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions,\u201d Clinton said in that recent interview.\n\nBut I think [the Russians] have got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she\u2019s also a Russian asset. . . . Yeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset. I mean, totally. They know [Trump] can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate.\n\nThe idea that the Kremlin is getting ready to support a third-party Tulsi Gabbard run is a form of madness, one that is becoming distressingly common among the septuagenarian outpatient group that America knows as its political-leadership class. That Clinton folded together Trump, Gabbard, and Stein this way nearly illustrated the way in which, for a certain kind of establishmentarian, all foreign-policy disagreement is evidence of treason.\n\nBecause the performance of our policy elite over the past two decades is so poor, they now must suspect everyone of being a Russian agent these days. Progressive journalist Glenn Greenwald is a \u201cRussian agent\u201d for these people. Mitch McConnell is \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d Nancy Pelosi says of the American president, \u201cAll roads lead to Putin.\u201d I suppose the supermajority of Americans who opposed America\u2019s changing the Syrian regime in 2013 are Kremlin agents, too. Even your humble scribe has been accused of being on Putin\u2019s payroll by full-time online maniacs who occasionally take side gigs pretending to defend the free world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy appreciation for Tulsi Gabbard has mostly been played off as a joke. But it\u2019s real enough. Gabbard has occasionally relied on some dodgy materials while making her case against the American intelligence community, but I like that she has an independent streak and a genuinely different, undeniably American background. She served in the military after 9/11 and still serves as a reserve officer. She is consistently skeptical of what she calls regime-change wars. I\u2019m happy that she pointed out the gap between Donald Trump\u2019s America First rhetoric about bringing the troops home and the fact that he simply moved them from Syria to Saudi Arabia. Gabbard has tried, unsuccessfully, to moderate her party\u2019s more paranoiac secularism, the type that sees a judge\u2019s membership in the Knights of Columbus as a threat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, that last point is one of the most salient. Gabbard has been to a theater of war, and perhaps she has a more intuitive sense of the difference between real danger and cynical paranoia. Where others imagine Vatican plots when evaluating recent judicial nominee Brian Buescher, she sees an American Catholic with whom she has political differences. (Political differences are not quite yet criminalized in this country.) Where others concoct collusion with Russia, she sees genuine American dissent from Washington orthodoxy.\n\nPerhaps war-skeptical conservatives are to Gabbard what Warren Harding was to Eugene V. Debs. President Harding pardoned Debs; his crime was giving a dovish speech in Chicago opposing President Wilson\u2019s \u201cwar to end all wars.\u201d It\u2019s salutary to remember that war often makes not just the soldiers, but its leaders mean and insane. Clinton pretends to uncover a fifth columnist, thereby revealing that her own judgement, like that of the foreign policy she represents, is paranoid and subject to dementia. But Gabbard is innocent, and only the young can be as idealistic as she is.", "description": "The idea that the Kremlin is getting ready to support a third-party Tulsi Gabbard run is a form of madness, one that is becoming distressingly common among the septuagenarian outpatient group that America knows as its political-leadership class.", "authors": ["Michael Brendan Dougherty", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
