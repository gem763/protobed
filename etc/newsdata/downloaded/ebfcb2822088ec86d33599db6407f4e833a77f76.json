His father Jeffrey has been waging a court battle to save James from his pediatrician mother, Jeffrey\u2019s ex-wife, who claims James is really a girl named Luna. The mother has been dosing James with puberty-blocking medications, and will eventually start injecting estrogen.\n\nA jury in Dallas just ruled that the mother, Dr. Anne Georgulas, will have full and sole custody of James. The gender transition will proceed as planned.\n\nThe Catholic who tweets as Irenist remarked:\n\nWe already live in an Integralist regime. But the religion is secular progressivist wokeness.https://t.co/R8Ekn3JbGP \u2014 Irenist\ud83c\uddfb\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea (@1renist) October 22, 2019\n\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nA note for those who don\u2019t know this language. \u201cIntegralism\u201d is a Catholic concept advocating, in general, subordinating the state to Catholic teaching. Edgardo Mortara was a Jewish child living in the Papal States under Pope Pius IX. He was baptized secretly by the family\u2019s Catholic housekeeper. Pius IX sent agents of the state to seize the boy from his Jewish parents so that he could be brought up as a Catholic, in accordance with his baptism. This caused a huge scandal in 19th-century Europe, for obvious reasons, and was cited by liberals of the era as why the Catholic Church must not be allowed to have political power.\n\nNow, according to Irenist, the liberal state has turned little James Younger into an Edgardo Mortara of the Woke.\n\nNote well that this happened in Texas, and was not a decision by a lone judge, but by a jury. We don\u2019t know the details of their deliberations, but it can be assumed that the jury accepted the testimony of medical authorities brought in by Dr. Georgulas. Here is a video from Jeffrey Younger\u2019s website SaveJames.com:\n\nDivorces are often quite ugly. Jeffrey Younger\u2019s description of the breakdown of his marriage to Anne Georgulas is, of course, his own side of the story \u2014 but if he is telling the truth here, it\u2019s sick, sick stuff. It looks like a vengeful ex-wife using her son to wreak revenge on her ex-husband. Whatever the truth of their failed marriage, there is no good reason at all to compel a seven-year-old child to take hormones that will destroy his normal sexual development. But this is what\u2019s happening [UPDATE: A reader points out that the injections have not yet begun] \u2014 and the father is isolated. As Jeffrey Younger says on his website, all the institutions in which his son is embedded now accept the boy\u2019s female identity, and are\n\nJames dresses as a girl at school. Goes by a girl\u2019s name. Uses the girl\u2019s restroom. All his authority figures at school affirm he is a girl \u2014 teachers, principals, police officers, peer students, librarian. This child is being lied to by the very institutions that should be protecting him. It\u2019s all being instigated by Ms. Georgulas to get the Father out of the child\u2019s life, because she knows Father will not and cannot affirm his son is a girl. Ms. Georgulas has found the perfect and timely strategy to chisel off the little remaining influence the Father has.\n\nThis is a Greek Orthodox family. They attend the Greek parish in Euless, Texas, a Dallas suburb. Jeffrey Younger claims that his ex-wife has turned the parish against him. Could this be true? Have the family\u2019s priest and bishop spoken out to defend this Orthodox father and this Orthodox child James from this grotesque medical intervention? I don\u2019t know. I cannot imagine any case in which Orthodox Christians should affirm this kind of abuse of a child. An Orthodox child too!\n\nI have no idea what happened in this particular parish, and in this particular case. Unless you\u2019re part of the parish, neither do you. Generally, though, in the Orthodox Church and other churches: The silence of the churches about gender ideology and the gender transition of children speaks volumes.\n\nWhat is the broader lesson for the rest of us? We read on this site\u2019s comments regularly the claim by some readers that we need to have secession in this country, to let the blue states go their way, and the red states go theirs. This is a fallacy \u2014 and the James Younger case shows why. This shocking, scandalous, anti-family ruling did not happen in Massachusetts or California; it happened in Texas. There are no safe places. This ideology that is taking over our country is destroying the family and even destroying the very concepts of male and female. Though I do not know the specifics of the James Younger case, it is certainly true that, as Jeffrey Younger says, the institutions of our society are either embracing it (the schools) or remaining silent as this malign ideology advances.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s impossible, but if I were this father, I would try to kidnap my son and flee to Russia and seek asylum. I can imagine his grief and pain over what his ex-wife is doing to that little boy, with the full power of the state and society\u2019s institutions behind her. What a horror show. What a terrible foretaste of the future of this decadent country.\n\nI might be wrong here, but it seems to me that there is a parallel between what\u2019s going on with little James Younger, and the embrace of pagan fertility idols by the Pope, and its placement in a Roman church by clerical authorities. You saw yesterday that a couple of unidentified people, no doubt faithful Catholics, seized the wooden statues and dumped them in the Tiber. Pachamama sleeps with the fishes. Their act was no doubt illegal, but what they were protesting was so outrageous \u2014 the defilement of a sacred Christian space \u2014 that one can understand why they did what they did. Had Orthodox clergy placed these fertility idols in an Orthodox church, I would have done the same thing as these Catholic men.\n\nHow much worse is the irreversible defilement of a child\u2019s body and psyche by his mother, deranged by gender ideology! Again: where is the voice of the Orthodox Church in all this? Are Orthodox leaders behaving like the Pope and liberal Catholic bishops and priests, accepting meekly, or even affirming, what ought not to be accepted? To be clear, I allow for the possibility that there is something going on here, in this particular case, that justifies the public silence of the clergy and bishops in the James Younger matter. And it is possible that the clergy and hierarchy has been involved behind the scenes. But the case of James Younger \u2014 \u201cLuna\u201d \u2014 is a public matter, in the courts, and has now received national media attention. Silence is no longer possible.\n\nI say to every Orthodox bishop and priest, and to all Christian leaders, in all the churches: you are going to have to take a stand, sooner or later. This issue is coming for you. If you are not talking about gender ideology with your congregations, and teaching them, why not? Your silence will be received by some in your congregations as collaboration with Babylon, and by others as capitulation to bigotry. As David Gushee, the pro-LGBT Evangelical theologian, wrote in 2016:\n\nMiddle ground is disappearing on the question of whether LGBT persons should be treated as full equals, without any discrimination in society \u2014 and on the related question of whether religious institutions should be allowed to continue discriminating due to their doctrinal beliefs. It turns out that you are either for full and unequivocal social and legal equality for LGBT people, or you are against it, and your answer will at some point be revealed. This is true both for individuals and for institutions. Neutrality is not an option. Neither is polite half-acceptance. Nor is avoiding the subject. Hide as you might, the issue will come and find you.\n\nIf an Orthodox father fighting to save his little boy from being turned into a female can\u2019t count on the full and vocal backing of the church, what does that say about the condition of the church? Christian readers, this is why we have to do the Benedict Option. It\u2019s not about building a \u201csafe space\u201d; it\u2019s about building Christian resilience and Christian resistance, and building the networks needed to support father and sons like the Youngers from persecution by the state and civil society institutions. It\u2019s happening right here in front of our eyes. There\u2019s no escaping to live in Red States. If this can happen to a child and his father in Texas, it could happen anywhere. This is what it means to live in a post-Christian culture; this is how the law is changing. What happened to Jeffrey Younger and his little boy James could happen to you and your family. Who will have your back when it does?\n\nUPDATE: A decade ago, maybe a little more, it would have been clear to most people \u2014 that is, most people who sit on juries \u2014 that a mother attempting to jack a little boy up with hormone blockers and, in time, estrogen, was unfit to care for him. This decision is the fruit of a long and successful propaganda campaign. This is post-Christian society. If you had said back in the early 2000s that it was going to come to this point, you would have been denounced as a fear-mongering bigot. Now it\u2019s just reality. Never, ever, ever trust the progressives on these issues. They say whatever they have to say to disarm the opposition.\n\nUPDATE.2: Here is a more detailed report about testimony in the case. I should have mentioned that this boy\u2019s mother is not biologically related to him. She and Jeffrey Younger conceived James and his twin Jude through IVF, using an egg donor.\n\nUPDATE.3: I am VERY pleased to be told by a reader that the local Orthodox parish has publicly come out against transgenderism, and placed on its website a public statement by the Greek metropolitan explaining why transgenderism cannot be accepted by Orthodox Christians.\n\nSo the parish took a clear stand, it appears. Again, this is good to hear. But you know, the leadership every church \u2014 Orthodox, Catholic, and otherwise \u2014 had better take a stand, and educate the congregations. This is coming at us all hard and fast!\n\nUPDATE.4: Reader Xenie points out that a deacon in the parish testified on behalf of the father.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1152963605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
