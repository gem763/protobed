The fluffy adorable thing that would later turn out to be a spawn birthed straight from the seventh circle of hell, gifted to Earth to do naught but annoy the ever-living shit out of everyone it came into contact with. I regret to inform you that as we hurtle towards the prime present-giving time of the year, the next generation of Furby-adjacent creatures has arrived, and its name is Rizmo.\n\nRizmo is being hailed as the \u201chottest toy\u201d for this year\u2019s Christmas season, so cue probably thousands of frantic parents trying to buy the demonic transforming fluffball between now and December 24.\n\nIt starts off looking like a fluffy egg with little light-up eyes, and as you sing to it (???), cradle and rock it like a baby, and generally make noise around it, it evolves into its second phase: Egg With Tail.\n\nFrom Egg With Tail, you continue to care for it and give it all your undivided attention, probable blood pact, and promise of your first-born child and Egg With Tail evolves again into the fully-fledged Rizmo.\n\nWhich kinda looks like an off-brand, bootleg Furby. Or if a Furby and a Gremlin had a baby.\n\nLook at this thing.\n\nConsidering the Furby that I was eventually given as a present for whatever gift-giving event it was ended up being thrown at the wall in the middle of the night because it would not shut the fuck up, I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d do well with a responsive toy that not only talks to me, but I have to sing at it.\n\nApparently though if you leave it to its own devices, it farts and then laughs at its own farts, so maybe we have more in common than I first thought.\n\nSo if you\u2019re wanting to annoy the shit out of your friends/siblings with kids, Rizmo is your go-to Chrissy present for your nieces, nephews, godchildren, and/or anyone between the ages 4 and 10. Give \u2019em a bunch of extra batteries too, just to really make that thing last forever.\n\nPlease do not give me one of these, if only because I can assure you it\u2019ll end up tossed out my lounge room window within a week.", "description": "We're very sorry to report that the next generation's Furby is a thing called 'Rizmo' and it's perfect to gift to the kids of everyone you wanna annoy.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/rizmo-hell-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
