According to Sequoia Capital, he soon attracted the attention of an early mutual fund group, Capital Group, which staked Valentine, allowing him to form a $3 million venture fund in 1974. Among his first bets from that pool of capital: Atari and Apple. He later led the firm into numerous other high-flyers, including Cisco Systems.\n\nValentine continue to lead Sequoia until handing over the reins well before retirement age to Doug Leone and Michael Moritz, though he continued attending partner meetings for another 10 years. The partners have said they were happy for his continued advice and guidance \u2014 not that they always agreed with him.\n\nIn 2017, in keeping with the firm\u2019s focus on succession and ensuring smooth transitions, partner Roelof Botha was made U.S. head of the firm working under Leone, who oversees the firm\u2019s global operations with Neil Shen, the founder and managing partner of Sequoia Capital China. (Moritz stepped away for health reasons in 2012, though he has continued to remain actively involved in the firm.)\n\nLeone issued a statement this afternoon about Valentine\u2019s passing, writing: \u201cWe are deeply saddened to share that Don Valentine passed away on October 25, 2019. Don\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of Silicon Valley. He shaped Sequoia and left his imprint not just on those of us who had the privilege to work with him or the many philanthropic institutions that invested with Sequoia, but also on the founders and leaders of some of the most significant technology companies of the later part of the twentieth century. Our thoughts are with Don\u2019s wife, Rachel, with his family, and with all those inspired by his pioneering vision and indelible impact.\u201d\n\nValentine chose the name Sequoia because it \u201cconveyed the longevity and strength of the tallest of redwoods,\u201d according to the firm\u2019s tribute today to Valentine. The partners note, too, the \u201chumility of someone who refrained from putting his own name on our business.\u201d\n\nValentine is survived by his wife; three children; and seven grandchildren, according to Sequoia.\n\nValentine joined TechCrunch at a Disrupt event back in 2013. He appeared along with another pioneer of the venture industry, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers cofounder Tom Perkins .
