I have sat at tables with him where he would say nothing, head lolling forward. He had issues with performing \u2013 the first time he headlined at London\u2019s Barbican in 2006, with a supporting cast that included Spiritualized, Vic Chesnutt and Teenage Fanclub, he stayed for three brief songs and fled: \u201cThank you. Sorry.\u201d In Sydney in 2010, he performed just two songs outside the venue and was already leaving, collecting his lyric notebooks, sloping around the corner to smoke a crafty fag, as the audience \u2013 many reduced to tears \u2013 started to clap.\n\n\u201cHe can do that, you know,\u201d remarked his brother Dick afterwards. \u201cMake the magic happen.\u201d\n\nDan was an awkward conversationalist when he could be bothered to hold a conversation: when he arrived in a new town, he liked nothing better than to go comic-book hunting and eat junk food. He had a great, albeit selective, memory. \u201cThis is fun, isn\u2019t it Dick?\u201d he would remark to his ever-patient brother as they searched out another store. \u201cI\u2019m having so much fun today.\u201d On one trip, his travelling troupe (Dan, Dick and his touring guitarist Brett Hartenbach) were fined nearly $1,400 by Jetstar in Japan for the extra weight incurred by Daniel\u2019s comics. Daniel loved the Beatles. He was so excited when he arrived in England to help promote Jeff Feuerzeig\u2019s wonderful 2005 documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston: \u201cThank you England!\u201d he announced on stage. \u201cThank you so much for giving the world the Beatles.\u201d\n\nDaniel Johnston: a potent, profoundly moving songwriter Read more\n\nAfter the screening, Dan, his brother and I got egged by a passing car. Daniel thought it was hilarious, the sight of his brother covered in egg.\n\nDan also loved the ideal of true love, if not the actuality. His former manager Jeff Tartakov told me that he was so excited when Melody Maker ran a review of one of his albums in the early 1990s \u2013 not because of the exposure, but because it had the heading Tell Laurie I Love Her. (Jeff incidentally is the unsung hero of this tragic tale: easily the man most responsible for Daniel\u2019s music not lying forgotten in some bargain basement \u2013 in Dan\u2019s own words as a \u201crejected unknown\u201d.) All of Dan\u2019s music up to that point had been designed with one goal: to win the heart of his one true love Laurie, the gravedigger\u2019s wife. It never happened, but then again it was never real.\n\nDan could be dismissive and rude one moment, the next greet you with a massive bear hug as if nothing had happened. He was self-aware to the extent that his music took place despite his mental illness, not because of it: he referenced it for sure in his songs, but only inasmuch as he referenced everything going on around him in his myopic worldview.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kurt Cobain performing at the MTV Video Music awards in 1992, wearing his Daniel Johnston T-shirt. Photograph: Frank Micelotta/Getty Images\n\n\u201cPeople always talk about the myth of Daniel\u2019s genius,\u201d Jeff memorably remarked to me one time. \u201cWhat about the genius of Daniel\u2019s myth?\u201d\n\nJeff had been staying with me in Brighton: on the same visit in 1993 he gave me Dan\u2019s Jebediah the Frog T-shirt, the only such item in Britain at the time. He told me to take great care of it. I did, but later I passed the shirt to another of his fans. We\u2019d been arguing at the time about his choice of clothes, and I told him he could only have it if he promised to wear it in public. Kurt Cobain was true to his promise and wore it on the front of Spin magazine and at corporate award ceremonies, leading to a surreal bidding war between Atlantic and Elektra Records as Dan answered calls from a mental hospital.\n\nDan was childish. He cared deeply about his art, his music \u2013 but would travel from town to town, playing with pick-up bands arranged almost randomly. He didn\u2019t seem to care about sound quality or the like \u2013 he was famously heralded as \u201cthe father of lo-fi\u201d with his cassette recorder-recorded albums \u2013 knowing that the magic lies deeper than that, deeper within. He had a strange sense of proportion that kept him in check. \u201cWhen I was going to college my friends made me feel famous,\u201d Dan told me. \u201cI was so famous I was writin\u2019 all the time. We were having parties. I would show up and I was Number One celebrity. I\u2019ve never been as famous as when I first started out.\n\n\u201cI hope I could feel that famous again,\u201d he added wistfully, \u201cbecause when you think you\u2019re famous and you think you\u2019re great, you might just have a chance of being great.\u201d Sometimes all you need is a massive heart, wonderful songs and a naked vulnerability.", "description": "Over many years of knowing Johnston, I discovered a man who was unpredictable and charming \u2013 and who valued true love and art more than almost anyone", "authors": ["Everett True"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d53331cb6d19dd1eec3d087bcb4bb309fe409b0/0_195_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fe69f2e1d81bcea79e2c15d97c51530e", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
