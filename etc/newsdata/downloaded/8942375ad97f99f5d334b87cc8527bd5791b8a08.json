With whom? That will be the big problem for us,\" he added, predicting that the Kurds would turn to Russia for protection.\n\nTrump tweeted that it would be up to \"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds\" to figure out what to do with the captured IS fighters.\n\nFrench officials had previously voiced concern that the jihadists could end up in the hands of Russian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, which could in turn use them as leverage in negotiations with the West on Syria's future.\n\nAnkara has assured that it will not allow IS to return \"in any shape or form.\"", "description": "European powers on Monday warned against a threatened Turkish offensive in northern Syria, saying the move, which has been facilitated by a US pullout, would boost the Islamic State group and spark a new refugee crisis.
