But it fell through after Rafi managed to come downstairs while on fire because the scarf burnt and freed her hands and feet,\" he said.\n\nRafi suffered burns to 80% of her body and died in hospital on April 10.\n\nBut she recorded a video before her death, repeating her allegations against the principal.\n\n\"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath,\" she said. She also identified some of her attackers.\n\nThe case has caused outrage in Bangladesh, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina vowing that \"none of the culprits will be spared legal action\".\n\nRights groups say the number of rape and sexual assault cases has increased in Bangladesh because authorities have failed to prosecute attackers.\n\n\"The horrifying murder of a brave woman who sought justice shows how badly the Bangladesh government has failed victims of sexual assault,\" Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.\n\n\"Nusrat Jahan Rafi's death highlights the need for the Bangladesh government to take survivors of sexual assault seriously and ensure that they can safely seek a legal remedy and be protected from retaliation,\" she added.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A schoolgirl has been burned to death in Bangladesh on the orders of her head teacher after she reported him for sexually harassing her, police have said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4979/d1c160cea1c04656ad279ccddbc0f8fd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-19"}
