It is an urgent matter. And there was simply no basis to keep this from the committee.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. told Fox News that the complaint \"doesn't change anything about the urgency and the credibility of the issue, and we will press the DNI [director of national intelligence] tomorrow to, you know, produce the full report.\"\n\nNeither Schiff nor Swalwell would confirm the specifics of the complaint and related documents that they reviewed.\n\nOn a related note, the House is also voting on a resolution Wednesday to have the complaint by an unnamed member of the intelligence community be released to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees before hearings on Thursday with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire are scheduled to take place.\n\nSenate Intel Vice Chair Mark Warner said he's \"still processing\" the complaint he read but added, \"it's going to make the testimony received tomorrow all that more important to get some questions cleared up.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he's \"even more worried about what happened than I was when I read the memorandum of the conversation. There are so many fact to be examined.\"\n\nElise Stefanik, R-N.Y., after reviewing the complaint tweeted: \"I do not support impeachment of President Trump. I have just read the whistleblower complaint made available to House Intelligence Committee Members. I believe strongly in transparency and it should be immediately declassified and made public for the American people to read.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday that there will be a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump. Dems have accused him of \"unprecedented and highly inappropriate efforts\" to discredit the whistleblower and violate the law by not sending the August complaint to Congress.\n\nThe White House released a summary of notes from the July 25 conversation between Trump and Zelensky in hopes of tamping down calls for impeachment.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Jason Donner and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Republican Rep.
