Over the past five years, its price has grown almost by half, rising by 41.9 per cent.\n\nThe government\u2019s commitment to improving the Barton Highway connecting Canberra to the Hume Highway at Yass, part of the route from Melbourne to Canberra and once dubbed the worst highway in NSW by the NRMA, has a lot to do with it, says Domain senior research analyst Dr Nicola Powell.\n\n\u201cThat government-funded project means it\u2019s easier for people in the area to commute to Canberra and the housing market in the Yass Valley is also being driven by rising prices in Canberra,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIts median price is still significantly below Canberra\u2019s, so it\u2019s still a very affordable area.\u201d\n\nSusi Serfontein, 45, has just bought in Yass and is planning to move there from Canberra where her husband works in defence.\n\nWeekenders are a popular option for people buying in Yass.\n\n\u201cYass is a great town with good schools, a hospital, nice eateries, wine bars, supermarkets and we hear we\u2019re going to get a Bunnings soon,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very sophisticated town, and people are so nice and down to earth compared to in the city.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second-biggest property price growth spurt in regional NSW was at Bellingen, inland from the mid-north coast, 520km north of Sydney and a 30-minute drive to Coffs Harbour.\n\nMost famously the home of TV broadcaster George Negus and Shine pianist David Helfgott, it\u2019s considered a rural idyll with an eclectic population.\n\nIts median price rose a much more modest 13 per cent to $542,500.\n\n21 Madmans Gully Road, Beechworth, in Victoria\u2019s Indigo Shire, is listed for sale for $669,000. House prices here have grown by more than 15 per cent over the year. Indigo Real Estate\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very vibrant place, a bit like Bangalow or Mullumbimby in the Byron hinterland,\u201d says local agent Nathan Cardow or Cardow & Partners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been rediscovered by Sydneysiders for its lifestyle.\u201d\n\nIn Victoria, the big winner was Indigo Shire, in the north-east of the state, which includes the towns of Beechworth, Chiltern, Rutherglen and Yackandandah.\n\nIts median price rose 15.2 per cent over the past year, and 47.2 per cent over the past five, to $397,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a large number of people relocating from Melbourne and Sydney, selling up at high prices and buying here and having money left over,\u201d said Indigo Real Estate agent Jamie Horn.\n\nThe Yass Valley in NSW, between Sydney and Melbourne, is being bombarded by newcomers relishing a rural lifestyle just a 50-minute drive from the capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also had a lot of people coming down from farms in northern parts of NSW because they see a greater security of water supply here. They\u2019re finding farms here, or getting off farms and buying small acreage for the lifestyle.\u201d\n\nTourism is now big in the area too, moving from Ned Kelly country to food, wine and cycling tours.\n\nResearcher Raelene Kwong, 51, moved to Yackandandah two years ago from Melbourne.\n\n\u201cWe wanted land where we could have a more self-sufficient lifestyle, living off-grid,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cFor that, you also need support from the community, and there\u2019s a great community here and it\u2019s not far to Albury-Wodonga where you have all the facilities of a city.\u201d\n\nGreater Shepparton, also in the Hume region, had Victoria\u2019s next highest growth of 14.4 per cent over the year, and 24.5 per cent over the past five, to a new median of $317,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s high demand from people in Melbourne looking for a place in the country and more affordable housing,\u201d said Justin Barnett of Walker Real Estate.\n\n\u201cThey can sell up and buy a better quality house and still have change in their pocket.\u201d\n\nThe amount a first-home buyer can spend on a property in order to qualify for the grant will be capped in line with local median prices, so regional towns and capital cities will be capped accordingly.\n\nIn Queensland, property prices in the tourism hotspot of the Douglas Shire in the far north of the state from the Bloomfield River down to Ellis Beach, rose the most at 19.8 per cent over the year to September 2019, and 38.6 per cent over five years. Its median now sits at $500,000.\n\n\u201cPeople are coming here for the lifestyle from Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane,\u201d said David Cotton, director of Raine & Horne Mossman and Port Douglas.\n\n\u201cThey come up here and work from home or they travel to Cairns from where they can fly anywhere in the world. And prices are still relatively cheap.\u201d\n\nThe Douglas region is Queensland has performed well the past year.\n\nIn South Australia, it was the Barossa where prices rose the most, 4.6 per cent over the past year and 12.3 per cent over the past five, to a median of $365,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOverall, South Australia has seen very modest price growth,\u201d said Dr Powell. \u201cSo, that\u2019s a good outcome for Barossa. It\u2019s probably benefiting as in other areas from the low interest rate and banks being more prepared to lend, as well as the lifestyle effect with wine and food and Maggie Beer.\u201d\n\nThe biggest price losers in regional Australia were units in Logan whose median price tumbled by 19.4 per cent to a new median of $241,750, Victoria\u2019s Southern Grampians where the median house price fell over the year by 18.5 per cent to $220,000, and, in NSW, Kiama, with a drop of 12.9 per cent to $827,000.\n\nThis story first appeared at Domain.\n\ndomain.com.au", "description": "The Yass Valley in NSW has recorded regional Australia\u2019s biggest house price growth of nearly 25 per cent in a single year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0342%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f946ff375378430032a5d25d5c1be20b63acf5a", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
