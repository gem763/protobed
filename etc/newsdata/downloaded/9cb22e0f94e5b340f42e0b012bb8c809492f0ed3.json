The joke was that Trump was looking for Donovan, a bare-knuckle \u201cfixer\u201d who takes care of stuff, wink wink, but thanks to Trump\u2019s inability to distinguish between fiction and reality, he had called Schreiber. No offense to Mr. Schreiber, who has gotten multiple Emmy nominations and gave arguably the best performance in the Oscar-winning film Spotlight, but when that\u2019s the big superstar cameo SNL producer Lorne Michaels is arranging for the season premiere, it might be time to refresh the Rolodex. Ray Donovan isn\u2019t even on the air right now!\n\nAt the end of SNL\u2019s 44th season, I wrote about what the show needed to revamp as it prepared to cover a pivotal election year. SNL has thrived on its political material since the election of Trump, but Baldwin\u2019s performance as the president has turned stale and uninspired, and the writing of his character rarely extends beyond broad buffoonery. But critical grousing aside, there\u2019s arguably no reason for Michaels and his team (including head writers Michael Che and Colin Jost) to shake things up; SNL just won its third Emmy in a row for Outstanding Variety Sketch Series, and in an era of declining network TV ratings, its viewership remains strong.\n\nNonetheless, this premiere episode felt like wheel-spinning from a creatively stagnant show. Woody Harrelson, an SNL veteran making his fourth hosting appearance, was a typically enthusiastic presence who still faded into the background of most sketches. Weekend Update, the centerpiece news segment hosted by Che and Jost, was oddly short, with some material clearly cut for time. Though SNL has been known to mock itself in the past anytime it ends up in the news, there was not even a self-deprecating reference to the Shane Gillis hiring fiasco.\n\nThe other major political segment of the night was a more thorough 2020 elections preview, a Democratic debate parody that further leaned into Michaels\u2019s penchant for surprise drop-ins from famous freelancers. While most of the candidates were played by cast members (Yang as Andrew Yang, Redd as Cory Booker, Alex Moffat as Beto O\u2019Rourke ), only one of the four major contenders was part of the regular ensemble\u2014McKinnon as Elizabeth Warren, a fairly hackneyed impression that feels too reminiscent of her work as Hillary Clinton.\n\nHarrelson stepped in as Joe Biden, wearing a set of particularly shiny dentures; Larry David returned as Bernie Sanders, a role he played during the 2016 election with ornery aplomb; and Maya Rudolph showed up as Kamala Harris, dominating proceedings with a recurring bit about her fondness for empty catchphrases. All three performers were solid, but none can be relied on to stop by every week as the show gears up to cover the Democratic primaries. Michaels\u2019s tendency to rely on veterans who will grab headlines is understandable, but it means newer cast members like Ego Nwodim and Melissa Villase\u00f1or remain on the sidelines unable to make a name for themselves. As the 45th season of the show moves forward, developing the rest of the cast should be SNL\u2019s priority, not putting in calls to Ray Donovan.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
