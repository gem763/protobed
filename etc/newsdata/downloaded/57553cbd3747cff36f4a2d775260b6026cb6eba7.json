Trust too.\n\nBut Aboriginal communities across Victoria are finding hope and putting their trust in themselves to get the treaty process right.\n\nDespite hundreds of years of broken promises, exploitation and the threat of annihilation, Aboriginal Victorians are getting behind the First Peoples\u2019 Assembly election under way around the state. It\u2019s another step in a journey that should see treaties signed between the Victorian government and Aboriginal clans and groups within years.\n\nIt\u2019s not been a quick process though. Even if you exclude the more than 200 years before it, the advancing the treaty process with Aboriginal Victorians bill was passed in June 2018, but the work has been ongoing since 2016.\n\nVoting opens for representatives to Victoria\u2019s First Peoples\u2019 Assembly Read more\n\nThe Aboriginal treaty working group and the Victorian treaty advancement commission, which I lead, have met regularly with communities across the state, including holding an elders forum to discuss creating an elders voice to the representative body.\n\nThere are Aboriginal election officers in the five regions across the state to help manage the mammoth task of registering Aboriginal voters and smoothing the path for them to participate in the First Peoples\u2019 Assembly election.\n\nThis has been a grassroots campaign aimed at giving every Aboriginal in the state \u2013 and traditional owners inside and outside the state \u2013 the opportunity to either stand as a candidate and/or vote. We\u2019ve even gone into every prison in Victoria to ensure prisoners get their chance to vote too.\n\nDespite all this there are significant challenges that we continually work to overcome.\n\nSome of those challenges are exactly why this process is so important: over-representation in the justice system, the mental health system, entrenched poverty, disconnection from country and poor health outcomes.\n\nAnd unlike state and federal elections this one is voluntary.\n\nThese are all reasons why this process should be pursued as rigorously as possible and they are all factors that make our job more difficult.\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, trust in state and federal government systems is in short supply among Aboriginal communities so we\u2019ve had to create our own electoral roll with its own unique provisions \u2013 including allowing 16-year-olds to vote \u2013 to better reflect our communities.\n\nWe also have a gender quota to ensure a strong representation of women on the assembly.\n\nSo as an Aboriginal woman and after those three and a half years of engaging with the Aboriginal community in Victoria, I\u2019m disappointed to hear a woman of Lidia Thorpe\u2019s experience and skills is withdrawing as a candidate for the assembly.\n\nI\u2019m sad she thinks enrolments are embarrassingly low. Given our people\u2019s devastating story over the past two centuries, the challenges I\u2019ve outlined that we face daily, and the litany of broken promises from authorities, I\u2019m inspired by our peoples\u2019 enthusiasm for the path we\u2019re walking.\n\nVictoria a step closer to Indigenous treaty with creation of First Peoples' Assembly Read more\n\nIt\u2019s inspiring for me to hear from prisoners who say the assembly can be a means to reconnecting them with their culture. It\u2019s inspiring for me to hear the youth say they see it as a way for their voices to be heard. I\u2019m inspired when I hear the stolen generations describe the assembly as a pathway back into the community circle. And who could be anything but inspired when the elders, whose languages were outlawed and who were pushed off their lands, say the assembly can help reinforce their vital cultural roles.\n\nI emphasise, however, that this is a start. The assembly will not be the finish. It is a start. It needs to grow.\n\nThe assembly will negotiate with the state government a framework or set of rules under which Aboriginal groups and clans can agree on treaties. It will also establish an independent umpire under which treaty negotiations will be conducted, and a fund which will enable Aboriginal clans and groups to negotiate with the government on a more even playing field.\n\nThere is much to be done and the assembly and its role will evolve over time. But it\u2019s the Aboriginal people of Victoria who will give the assembly its strength and legitimacy. And in them I trust and it\u2019s them who give me hope.\n\n\u2022 Jill Gallagher AO is the Victorian treaty advancement commissioner", "description": "Despite hundreds of years of broken promises, Aboriginal Victorians are getting behind the First Peoples\u2019 Assembly election", "authors": ["Jill Gallagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4295801a6253458f4f0ee5f9ca455c1fcf898ed8/0_91_5229_3137/master/5229.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c0361f4c2fee9670fadb0cbc4a6589fa", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
