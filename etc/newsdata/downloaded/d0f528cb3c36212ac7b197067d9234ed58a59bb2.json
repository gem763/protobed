But when they learned of Shamsie\u2019s support for the BDS movement, they announced that they would cancel their original vote and withdraw the award.\n\n\u201cWith its vote for the British writer Kamila Shamsie \u2026 the jury honoured the author\u2019s outstanding literary work,\u201d they said. \u201cAt that time, despite prior research, the members of the jury were not aware that the author has been participating in the boycott measures against the Israeli government for its Palestinian policies since 2014.\u201d\n\nThe prize, named for the German-Jewish Nobel laureate Nelly Sachs, is awarded by the German city of Dortmund to a writer promoting \u201ctolerance and reconciliation\u201d who has worked to improve cultural relations between people. Previous winners including Milan Kundera and Margaret Atwood. Its statutes stipulate that the life and work of an author should be included in the jury\u2019s reasoning.\n\n\u201cShamsie\u2019s political positioning to actively participate in the cultural boycott as part of the BDS campaign a \u2026 is clearly in contradiction to the statutory objectives of the award,\u201d said the jury. \u201cThe cultural boycott does not transcend borders, but affects the whole of Israeli society regardless of its actual political and cultural heterogeneity. Kamila Shamsie\u2019s work is also withheld from the Israeli population in this way. This contrasts with the claim of the Nelly Sachs prize to proclaim and exemplify reconciliation among peoples and cultures. The jury regrets the situation in every respect.\u201d\n\nIn May, the German parliament passed a motion labelling the BDS movement as antisemitic, calling it \u201creminiscent of the most terrible chapter in German history\u201d. The motion was criticised by 60 Jewish and Israeli academics, who said in an open letter that it was part of a trend \u201clabelling supporters of Palestinian human rights as antisemitic\u201d.\n\nShamsie, who has put her name to the cultural boycott of Israel, said it was a matter of great sadness to her \u201cthat a jury should bow to pressure and withdraw a prize from a writer who is exercising her freedom of conscience and freedom of expression\u201d.\n\nShe described it as a \u201cmatter of outrage that the BDS movement (modelled on the South African boycott) that campaigns against the government of Israel for its acts of discrimination and brutality against Palestinians should be held up as something shameful and unjust\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the just-concluded Israeli elections, Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to annex up to one third of the West Bank, in contravention of international law,\u201d Shamsie said, \u201cand his political opponent Benny Gantz\u2019s objection to this was that Netanyahu had stolen his idea; this closely followed the killing of two Palestinian teenagers by Israeli forces \u2013 which was condemned as \u2018appalling\u2019 by the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. In this political context, the jury has chosen to withdraw the award from me on the basis of my support for a non-violent campaign to bring pressure on the Israeli government.\u201d\n\nShamsie, who won the Women\u2019s prize for fiction last year, said the city of Dortmund had refused to publish her statement with their press release. She clarified that she will not allow her work to be published in Israel \u201con the basis that there is no Israeli publisher who is completely unentangled from the state \u2026 If a BDS-compliant Israeli publisher existed (as was formerly the case before the publishing house Andalus closed down) I would be happy to have them publish my work,\u201d she said.\n\nThe novelist Ahdaf Soueif said the withdrawal of the award was \u201ca manifestation of a new McCarthyism \u2013 on an international scale\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to note, however, is that even in Germany there\u2019s still a struggle going on,\u201d Soueif said. \u201cSo it really is up to each individual and each organisation to choose whether they\u2019re on the side of freedom of conscience and expression or on the side of a reactionary political censorship. Attempting to shut down a conversation on the issue of Palestinian political and human rights \u2013 an issue which so many have taken to their hearts \u2013 is simply not going to work.\u201d\n\nJodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship, said that it was deeply disturbing that Shamsie had been stripped of the honour \u201cfor her personal opinions.\n\n\u201cAn award meant to recognise a writer for \u2018outstanding literary contributions to the promotion of understanding between peoples\u2019 has been withdrawn because the writer personally supports a non-violent movement that is intended to focus attention on respect for universal human rights,\u201d said Ginsberg.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly we are seeing fiction writers being policed for their political opinions and books cancelled as a result. The result will be the very opposite of what the prize organisers seek to achieve: a narrowing of voices and therefore fewer opportunities to promote understanding between people.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Nelly Sachs prize was given to Shamsie this month, but its German jury has reversed decision because of the novelist\u2019s pro-Palestinian activism", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e878a2f63f1706c61ae292ebfb0e388804d9bef8/76_275_5878_3527/master/5878.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2ef146ad29791c7843d0f7f7f056b5f5", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
