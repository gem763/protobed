Strategic collaboration is crucial, particularly when the government party is gaming the system by, for example, controlling the media.\u201d\n\nPiS claimed victory in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary election, winning nearly 44% of the vote according to nearly complete results. The biggest opposition grouping, Civic Coalition (KO), scored 27.2% and the leftist alliance, the Left, 12.5%.\n\nBut the ruling party lost control of the senate after opposition parties in most districts united around joint candidates, limiting its control of the legislature for the first time in four years and making it harder for it to push new laws through fast.\n\nIt will not enjoy the free rein it has had since 2015 in the lower house either, and could well be forced to seek the backing of MPs from a new far-right group, Confederation, on more controversial policies.\n\nIn Hungary, meanwhile, the hardline prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, suffered his greatest political setback in a decade when a pro-European, centre-left challenger ousted the Fidesz-backed incumbent as mayor of Budapest by 51% to 44%.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Viktor Orb\u00e1n, left, with the outgoing mayor of Budapest, Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s.

It was also rewarded by poorer, mainly rural voters for the 70bn-zloty (\u00a314bn) social and welfare programmes it has rolled out.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, it was expecting to do better \u2013 it said it had not been given \u2018what it deserved\u2019,\u201d Stanley said. The party had not been altogether successful in walking the tightrope between keeping its base happy and not alienating floating voters, he said.\n\n\u201cBoth the blatant TV propaganda and the anti-LGBT campaign will actually have ended up putting some people off. PiS will not be able to govern in the same way that it has until now,\u201d Stanley said.\n\nBut the performance of Poland\u2019s Left alliance in returning to parliament also suggested that \u201cwith good organisation and positive messaging, opposition parties can do well\u201d even in environments where they are under pressure, he added.\n\n\u201cThis idea that has held sway for so long in Poland and Hungary, that the other side has complete control of the discourse and all we can do is wait for them to make a mistake, looks like it may no longer apply.\u201d\n\nA coordinated opposition with a strong counter-narrative can cut through, agreed Gosty\u0144ska-Jakubowska. \u201cCertainly, we can say that some elements of the opposition\u2019s strategy \u2013 non-aggression pacts \u2013 do seem to have worked. It\u2019s obviously not a uniform picture. But it could be a beginning.\u201d", "description": "Analysts say tactic of cooperation against nationalist parties appears to be working", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4763827a3ce9ba4a53b6c0668758ce63330fa56a/0_295_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ef5c2ac84dbdba8800825d8b72903ed6", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
