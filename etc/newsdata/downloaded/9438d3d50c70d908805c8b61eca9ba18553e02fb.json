Got a fine in the post. Made several phone calls got no joy. Ended up giving up. The outcome is we no longer use the business at Peel Centre. Maybe Peel and those shops should listen to the shopping public.'\n\nYvonne Holmes said people should 'boycott this carpark' where people will eventually stop going.\n\nMatie Kann said: 'The company are awful. The charges are totally disproportionate. I\u2019ve had two and I refuse to park there anymore even though I\u2019m a regular visitor.'\n\nLorraine Moores said she has 'learnt (her lesson)' and 'it's no wonder people don't use Stockport for shopping'.\n\nJanet Kershaw said: 'They sent me a fine for \u00a3100 saying I was 40 minutes late. I was lucky I still had the ticket. I had another hour on the ticket.\n\n'I rang them up and told them I have the ticket and I had an hour left from the time they said I left. They looked on their system and said \u2018oh it\u2019s an error you paid 3 pounds we will cancel it\u2019. I keep all my parking tickets now.'\n\nCady Phillips added: 'We got two, the day after each other a few weeks ago and we ALWAYS get a ticket. We have sent a letter of dispute. It\u2019s a joke.'\n\nOthers called for the ticket machines to be changed as some accidentally entering the wrong registration number.\n\nStan Duncan added an extra digit into the machine but his appeal was successful as he left in time.\n\nHe told the Manchester Evening News: 'I do however think the machines for entering ones registration could be more user friendly, and with better lighting and highlight when an extra digit has been entered.\u201d\n\nAlex Hiles, corporate services director of Anchor Group Services, said drivers who have not had their issue resolved should following the appeals advice printed on the back of their ticket.\n\nAnd a full review of each case is 'not always possible on the phone', according to Mr Hiles.\n\nIf the individual is unsuccessful, they can submit their appeal to POPLA (The Parking on Private Land Appeals Service) for independent review and adjudication.", "description": "Drivers at The Peel Centre carpark in Stockport, Greater Manchester, have been charged up to \u00a3100 despite paying this month.
