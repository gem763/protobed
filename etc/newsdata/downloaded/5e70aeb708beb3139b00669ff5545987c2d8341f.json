I think he (Dirk) understood why I didn't take Alonso out.\"\n\nSpeaking after the incident, Kuyt previously said: \"I didn\u2019t join in, as I wanted to rest a small injury, but I went along to watch and picked a safe-looking spot to stand beside the track with Rafa.\n\n\"Out of nowhere, Peter Crouch drove straight at me at roughly 35mph. He couldn\u2019t brake!\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"The only think I could do was jump in the air, and in the end I just managed to jump over Peter, and he crashed into cardboard boxes behind me.\n\n\"I was within a whisker of having my ankles torn to pieces, and would surely have missed the Champions League final.\"\n\nCrouch mentions the incident in his new book 'I, Robot: How To Be A Footballer 2'.\n\n\u201cI was not built for a go-kart,\" he writes.\n\n\"As I was coming into the pits, the brakes had gone and Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Xabi Alonso and Dirk Kuyt were standing in the way. I thought, \u2018Kuyt\u2019s getting it\u2019.\n\n\u201cI went flying into him. He jumped up, I went under him and I went straight into the fence. The go-kart burst into flames.\u201d\n\nFortunately Kuyt was unharmed and Liverpool went on to reach the Champions League final that season before suffering a heartbreaking defeat by AC Milan.", "description": "The Liverpool squad were on a team building trip ahead of their crucial Champions League encounter with Barcelona in 2007", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10097013.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Liverpools-Kuyt-celebrates-with-Crouch-after-scoring-during-their-English-Premier-League-soccer-mat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
