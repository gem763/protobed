John Delaney conveyed his take on how to tackle the U.S.-China trade war on FOX Business\u2019 \"Bulls and Bears\" on Tuesday.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFirst of all, Delaney, a Democrat from Maryland, expressed his concern with China\u2019s intellectual-property theft.\n\n\u201cThey steal intellectual property; they steal islands in the South China Sea,\u201d Delaney said.\n\nAs a means to address China\u2019s pompous actions, Delaney said he wants America to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nPresident Trump withdrew from the TPP because he believed it was outsourcing American jobs to 11 foreign nations. It was initially meant to promote free trade and was supposed to ensure trade done by land, sea, and air was respected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only Democrat who supports getting in that agreement because that allows us to compete with China, and we have to play the long game with China. We have to realize we\u2019re going to have to compete with them.\u201d - Rep. John Delaney\n\nThe idea America can unilaterally address the trade war through tariffs is wishful thinking, according to Delaney. He wants to work with U.S. allies to erase intellectual property theft.\n\n\u201cThe only way to actually take it to China on that issue is by getting our allies and U.S. private companies on the same page,\u201d Delaney said.\n\nWhen asked about dismantling tariffs entirely, Delaney noted some sort of trade deal would happen.\n\nDelaney believes China will buy varying degrees of soybeans and aircraft, but the underlying worry of intellectual property theft could remain.\n\nDelaney is still worried about American farmers in the Heartland, notably Iowa farmers.\n\n\u201cI travel around, [and] Iowa farmers are getting killed because of the trade war.\u201d - Rep. John Delaney (D-MD)\n\nAs many of the remaining Democratic candidates focus on the Iowa caucus, Delaney said any Democrat in office would improve the economy.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cI think some of the things that Sen. Warren and Sen. Sanders are running on will never pass the Congress, [so] I\u2019m not that worried about a lot of it,\" Delaney said.", "description": "Rep.
