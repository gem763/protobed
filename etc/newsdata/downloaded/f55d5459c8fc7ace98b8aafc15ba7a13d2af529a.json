But for those less elegant, \u201cchampion\u201d also described a person who \u201csurpassed all rivals in a sporting contest or other competition\u201d \u2013 and at Sheffield\u2019s Crucible Theatre on 29 April, such someone was Stephen Hendry.\n\nIn the entire history of sport, no individual has satisfied that definition with such emphatic dispassion and disconcerting monomania. Hendry wasn\u2019t the best long potter around, or the best safety player; he wasn\u2019t the best striker of a ball either, nor was he the most creative around the table. But he was absolutely the best at being the best, revolutionising the sport with his relentlessly attacking break-building \u2013 a tactic that worked only because of his absolute imperviousness to pressure.\n\nHendry was 21 when he won that first world championship \u2013 still the youngest ever to do it \u2013 and, though he missed out the following year, was rarely troubled in winning the five after that. He took a gloriously miserable joy in dispensing merciless thrashings, his disgust for his elders utterly affirming; like all the best sportsmen, he was implacably dedicated to the sacred art of making the other bloke look a fool. Such obsession meant he was finished as a force at 27, his youthful ire expiring as he totally lost the run of himself and began fraternising with his opponents instead of grinding them to granules. But for as long as he was him, there was only him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Love\u2019s young dream.

Sometimes will, skill and character are enough.\n\nGraduating from Cambridge with a first in mathematics, Rosi Sexton had no need to pursue a career in mixed martial arts \u2013 let alone in 2000, when it was barely deemed a sport for men, never mind women. Except Sexton had every need to pursue a career in mixed martial arts because she could do no other, her obsession with perfection demanding she seek the most exacting challenge imaginable.\n\nOver the next 14 years she accumulated an MSc, a PhD and a 13-5 record, pushing beyond the limits of her athletic gifts to become the first British woman to appear in the UFC. A pioneer and an inspiration, Sexton glorified a game as cerebral as it is physical, proving that professional combat and amateur thuggishness are not linked. As it happens, she once held Cage Warriors\u2019 132lb belt, but her champion status exists independently of that fact.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosi Sexton works her angles at UFC 161.

Through the 70s and 80s West Indies were not just the greatest cricket team ever but the greatest team ever and perhaps the greatest anything ever, so the subsequent decline of things at the cloaca of capitalism, nepotism and arseholism, represents significant sporting tragedy.\n\nBut since 2015 the team has had a captain who bats well, bowls fast and leads brilliantly, Holder\u2019s relaxed toughness and buccaneering spirit reflecting a man ensconced in his own skin to an enthralling degree. Meanwhile, in public and behind the scenes, he champions the rights of his players \u2013 of all players \u2013 to be paid properly and for money in the game to be distributed more equitably, as part of championing Test cricket, as part of championing cricket, as part of championing West Indies, back to the islands and back to the world.\n\nThe Merriam Webster dictionary says a champion is \u201cone who shows marked superiority\u201d, and that is Holder to a tee: he is better than your average.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jason Holder wonders how it might be.

One quiet afternoon in the the press room, Adrian Lewis and Mardle performed a bout of #bantz, the two-time champion lauding the zero-times champion as an \u201ceight-times competitor\u201d.\n\nYet Mardle is a champion nonetheless, because no one rhapsodises and evangelises \u201cthe greatest sport in the world\u201d with such gusto; in that regard, he is not just a champion but the champion. Sharing analysis and expertise without compromising his sense of wonder, his commentary reminds us that occupants of the oche are ordinary people performing extraordinary feats under unfathomable stress, and our duty as human beings is to appreciate them. If you have children or plan to have children, teach them this: find yourself someone who loves you as much as Wayne Mardle loves darts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Nah mate, I\u2019m just high on darts.\u2019\n\nObviously nothing is more important than sport, but sometimes sport has bestowed upon it personalities \u2013 such as Serena Williams \u2013 who transcend it to accomplish other, slightly less important stuff, like changing the world for the better. Whether in her open, honest accounts of motherhood, her refusal to do what she\u2019s told, or her love of who she is, what she does, and how she represents, Williams is unapologetically herself. She ain\u2019t sorry.\n\nThe problem being that her right to these inalienable things had to be earned by her being a 23-time grand slam singles champion, which is to say that doing whatever you want and being whoever you are should not be a revolutionary act. But such is tennis and such is the world, both of which are different places thanks to the unprecedented genius and transformative fibre of the champion\u2019s champion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest We live in her time!

In his time on Countdown he set records for points in a match and points in an octochamp run, eight being the maximum number of consecutive games any player is allowed to win. Then, after that, he returned to win his series, and when invited back for the periodic champion of champions contest won that too, breaking the points record for a grand final and becoming the first player to win a grand slam: essentially, every match he could possibly have played.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nIn 1996, the show invited its immortals to a competition that would crown the greatest of them all, and Freeman won every round by way of crucial conundrum, unscrambling a 10-letter word faster than his opponent to win 10 points, with the gap between them smaller than that. He then won the final as well, making him the show\u2019s all-time supreme champion of champions and absolute pnolanier.", "description": "From snookering monomania to an MMA pioneer via darts and Countdown, we examine sport\u2019s different kinds of champion", "authors": ["Daniel Harris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f574e9ae0c98e2ce17ccaaa28225c2e2cba77127/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=85dca908b8aa3d1d2d1bd527e8e7101d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
