According to the Times' sources, the complainant is a male CIA officer who was at one point assigned to work at the White House.\n\nThe whistleblower's attorney, Mark S. Zaid, told the Times to cease and desist because it was putting his client in danger.\n\nWhistle blower atty. Mark S. Zaid responds: \"Publishing details about the whistleblower will only lead to identification of someone, whether our client or the wrong person, as the whistleblower.

Rumor had it he threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if President Zelensky refused. The White House released the transcript of the call on Wednesday. While it did reveal that Trump asked about the Bidens' ties to Ukraine, it showed no evidence of quid pro quo. The House Intelligence Committee then released the complaint itself earlier today. In it, the whistleblower admits that he was not a direct witness to the events.", "description": ".09/26/2019 16:48:10PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/268/393a22cf-ec8e-4c10-b1c3-e90101b2b657.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
