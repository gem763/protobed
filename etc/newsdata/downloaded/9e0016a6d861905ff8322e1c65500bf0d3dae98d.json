(The Logic)\n\nTalking point: DeepMind\u2019s AI has already conquered chess, Go, Shogi, and deciphering ancient Greek. In January, it beat a few top-ranked StarCraft players, but it was only able to play with one of the game\u2019s three races. Now the AI can play all three, and is winning nearly every game it plays against humans. To do so, it needs to make tens of thousands of real-time decisions. The firm can use that ability for self-driving cars, language comprehension and weather prediction, according to DeepMind. The company is key to Google\u2019s long-term ambitions for AI, and this breakthrough comes as Google is taking increasing control of it. In September, DeepMind\u2019s health team moved over to Google. In April, Google disbanded an AI ethics panel after it clashed with DeepMind over how much independence the firm would have.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
