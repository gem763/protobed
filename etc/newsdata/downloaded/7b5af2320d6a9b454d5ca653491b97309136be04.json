While this has been horrible for the Bahamas, where the storm\u2019s pounding has been relentless, it may help spare Florida a bit, meteorologists said.\n\nUsually the upper atmosphere\u2019s winds push and pull hurricanes north or west or at least somewhere. They are so powerful that they dictate where these big storms go.\n\nBut the steering currents at 18,000 feet above ground have just ground to a halt. They are not moving, so neither is Dorian.\n\nAfter reaching record-tying wind speeds on landfall in the Bahamas, the storm just stalled. Its eyewall first hit Grand Bahama Island Sunday night, and 18 hours later part of the eye still lingered there, meteorologists said. The hurricane center late Monday called the storm \u201cstationary\u201d after several hours of crawling at 1 mph.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Jeff Masters, meteorology director at Weather Underground who used to fly into hurricanes. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a Category 5 stall for so long in the Atlantic hurricane record.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s happening \u2013 or more aptly, not happening \u2013 has been an ongoing battle between high pressure systems that push storms and low pressure systems that pull them.\n\nA high pressure system in Bermuda has been acting like a wall, keeping Dorian from heading north. But a low pressure trough moving east from the Midwest has eroded that high and is trying to pull Dorian north. Those two weather systems \u201care fighting it out and neither is winning,\u201d Masters said.\n\nThere\u2019s just no flow pushing it anywhere. Think of it like a tiny paper boat or a pebble in a stagnant pond, which just doesn\u2019t move, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nAir \u2013 high off the ground and closer to where people live \u2013 is often stagnant in the summer and this is an extreme version of that, Masters said.\n\nIn 2017, Hurricane Harvey got stuck when steering currents collapsed, absolutely drenching Houston, but that wasn\u2019t as powerful a storm as Dorian, Klotzbach said.\n\nUsually hurricanes that don\u2019t move eventually kill themselves because they churn up colder water from deep below the surface and storms need warm water as fuel, Masters said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to keep moving,\u201d Masters said.\n\nBut the Bahamas and the Gulf Stream are one of the few places where warm water runs so deep. Stalling isn\u2019t as much of a death sentence there as elsewhere, but it will still weaken the storm a bit, which is good for Florida and the U.S. East Coast, Klotzbach said.\n\nAnd the longer Dorian stalls in the Bahamas, the more the low pressure system has a chance to erode the high pressure and pull the hurricane north and away from Florida, Masters said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian has been stalled over tiny Grand Bahama Island for nearly a day, and the reason is because steering currents high up in the air have collapsed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/tropical_weather_76215_c0-156-3723-2326_s1770x1032.jpg?08ca3b237bcc05f27ac436c1d1d091ca4a0949be"}
