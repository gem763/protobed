Detroit Free Press\n\nDr. Meeta Singh, a sleep expert based in Novi, Michigan, has taken an unusual, behind-the-scenes role in the World Series, setting the bed times for the Washington Nationals.\n\nNo, she doesn\u2019t have the full bed-time authority afforded to most parents to say: Turn out the lights, Max Scherzer! I told you to go to bed, or you are gonna get grounded!\n\nBut she does give the Nationals detailed recommendations on every aspect of their sleep: How to reduce fatigue when traveling between time zones. When to travel after games to optimize sleep habits. What to do before going to bed. How to become more alert before night games. And when to take power naps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to how we make sleep schedules for astronauts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very precise.\u201d\n\nSCOUTING BEFORE ANALYTICS: Front offices try to find the perfect World Series recipe\n\nGAME 2 DISASTER: Astros confident heading into Washington down 2-0\n\nDr. Meeta Singh poses for a photo at Henry Ford Medical Center in Novi, Thursday, Oct. 24, 2019.

Really, it helps in every aspect of athletics.\u201d\n\nSitting in front of a computer at Henry Ford Medical Center in Novi, where she works, Singh bursts with pride while talking about the Nationals, feeling as if she has played a role in how they have gotten to this point, two wins from their first World Series championship. They have a 2-0 series lead over the Houston Astros and will play Game 3 on Friday night in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating and nerve-wracking ,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the season, Singh sent the Nationals a sleep schedule every two weeks, offering advice in a grid format. \u201cI\u2019d map out what I wanted them to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have to sit and look at their game time, look at their travel and then make a schedule out for them.\u201d\n\nDuring the postseason, her work has increased. She sends the Nationals a new plan every three or four days, even taking into account the team's late-night party after clinching a spot in the World Series.\n\n\u201cWhat I said to them, \u2018Of course, they are going to party,\u2019 \u201d Singh said. \u201cThis is a huge thing. Of course, they are going to be up. But what I\u2019ve always told them: 'On those days, when life happens, and you know you might not get enough sleep, the secret is to get enough sleep beforehand and then playing catch up once things settle down.' \u201d\n\nMaintaining a routine is the key to all of this. After the Nationals played an afternoon game in St. Louis in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, the team decided to stay in town overnight to get a good night\u2019s rest on Singh\u2019s recommendation, instead of rushing back and getting home late. Two days later, the Nationals won Game 3, 8-1. \u201cIt\u2019s little things like that and the Nationals are really good at it,\u201d Nationals second baseman Brian Dozier said. \u201cIt goes to show you that they really care about performance and whatever helps you.\u201d\n\nTo get to sleep faster, Singh encourages players to wear special orange-tinted glasses that block blue light, the part of the light spectrum that affects melatonin levels. \u201cIn darkness, melatonin is secreted,\" she said. \"That helps you fall asleep.\u201d\n\nSo are the Nationals following her advice?\n\n\u201cWe tried throughout the course of the year,\" Dozier said, \"but really extensively in the playoffs to really (stick to it).\"\n\nWashington Nationals' Brian Dozier, left, congratulates Anthony Rendon after Rendon scored on a single by Ryan Zimmerman off Minnesota Twins pitcher Martin Perez during the first inning of a baseball game Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2019, in Minneapolis.

And she got into the sports world almost by accident, working first with the Lions and eventually branching out to help the Red Wings, Tigers and Pistons.\n\nShe has given talks at MLB winter meetings, the NFL Combine and the NHL annual meetings. Earlier this month, Singh worked with the Belgium national soccer team before it beat San Marino, 9-0, becoming the first team to clinch a spot in next year's UEFA European Championship. And she offered advice to the Sacramento Kings before they played two preseason games against the Indiana Pacers in India.\n\n\u201cSleep and recovery are both integral to athletic performance,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThe kind of elite athletes I work with are trying to maximize their performance. They are always looking to what they can do and make even a small difference. Wins and losses are based on a small difference. Everybody is trying to do it. The first thing to remember is because sleep as a behavior makes up a third of your day. Making even small changes to that would result in noticeable changes to your performance the next day.\u201d\n\nSingh works extensively with the New Orleans Saints, sending them a schedule every week. \u201cThey were really struggling with the games that started at 4:25 in the evening,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked with them over that and they started winning.\u201d\n\nThe Saints sent her a game ball, which she finds humbling. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing,\" Singh said. \"I am an immigrant. I did not grow up with either football or baseball. It was pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nThe New Orleans Saints presented this ball to Michigan sleep doctor Meeta Singh after beating the Miami Dolphins, 20-0, in London. (Photo: Meeta Singh)\n\nShe also works with the coaches and support staff. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what league it is, the coaches, support staff and athletic trainers, their schedules are much worse than the players,\" she said. \"They get there before and they don\u2019t leave there until after.\u201d\n\nControl and discipline\n\nSingh started working with the Nationals in spring training, when she talked to the team in the clubhouse and spent a day giving advice to individual players. \u201cIt was very interactive \u2014 there are smart guys on that team, who ask smart questions,\u201d she said. \u201cThe skipper was like, \u2018Can you send us regular tips on how to sleep?\u2019\n\n\u201cThey want to control as much as they can, everything. This team is really disciplined. This is a team that would call me, and say, \u2018Tell me exactly what you want to do for the next games.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe declined to talk about individual players.\n\nBut she said many athletes work with her during the offseason, or text her for advice.\n\nSingh gives the players typical sleep advice \u2014 sleep in a cold room, don\u2019t use electronics, don\u2019t drink alcohol before bedtime. But she tailors specific recommendations to each player. Like the one who has a girlfriend on the West Coast.\n\n\u201cIf there is a player and his girlfriend lives on the other side of America, well, he wants to be on the phone with her for a few minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a guy who should wear those orange-colored sunglasses. So it\u2019s not too much light. He talks to his girlfriend. He can relax and then he goes to sleep.\u201d\n\nAs for Singh, these late-night World Series games have been messing with her bedtime. Sometimes, she can't help it. She just falls asleep.", "description": "A Michigan sleep doctor is setting bed times for the Washington Nationals as they chase the World Series, becoming a key member of the team off field.", "authors": ["Jeff Seidel", "Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
