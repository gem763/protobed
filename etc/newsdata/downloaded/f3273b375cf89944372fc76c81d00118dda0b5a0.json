The subpoena sent by House Democrats on Sept. 30 was \u201coverbroad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry,\u201d Sale wrote, adding that the documents requests are protected by \u201cattorney-client, attorney work-product, and executive privileges.\u201d In addition, Giuliani adopted the positions and legal analysis that went into the letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone on behalf of Donald Trump refusing to cooperate with Congress, Sale wrote.\n\nAn official working on the impeachment inquiry said that Giuliani\u2019s failure to comply will be used as evidence of obstruction. \u201cIf Rudy and the President truly have nothing to hide about their actions, Giuliani will comply,\u201d the official said.\n\nNow that he\u2019s helped Giuliani respond to the Congressional subpoena, Sale says he isn\u2019t representing Giuliani anymore. \u201cThe task I agreed to undertake is completed, so that ends my representation,\u201d Sale says. Sale said there hasn\u2019t been a falling out between him and Giuliani. \u201cThere is absolutely no split between us,\u201d Sale says.\n\nAsked if the letter amounted to the legal version of a middle finger, Giuliani cryptically replied with a one word text message: \u201cGreat\u201d.", "description": "An official said Giuliani\u2019s failure to comply will be used as evidence of obstruction", "authors": ["Brian Bennett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_gicZNiT5antC34rVfRDwA--~B/aD03MDg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/614dcf264e403c79876506366604c360", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
