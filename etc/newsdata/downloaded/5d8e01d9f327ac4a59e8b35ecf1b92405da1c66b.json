The seven-member CASAC still exists.\n\nCritics have said the move was part of an effort under Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, to cut the EPA's reliance on science when writing regulations.\n\n\"EPA is committed to scientific integrity and transparency,\" the agency said in an emailed statement, when asked about the start-up of the independent panel. \"EPA always welcomes comments from the public and it is not uncommon for special interest groups and coalitions to organize, meet and develop comments for submission to the record. EPA will continue to take into consideration these comments that meet our scientific standards.\"\n\nParticulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets that can include dust, dirt, soot and smoke. It has been linked to a variety of respiratory problems, asthma and lung cancer.\n\nEPA advisory boards provide scientific input for agency decisions around pollution and climate change regulation. They were created by Congress to serve as a check on EPA policies and research.\n\nThe independent panel plans to make its report public ahead of a meeting of CASAC next month.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Tom Brown)", "description": "The 20 experts were to review the science on particulate matter pollution and health beginning with a two-day meeting in Virginia on Thursday.
