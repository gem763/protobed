But they also raised U.S. and French flags, hoping the anti-ISIS coalition might keep its forces in the region. \u201cI remember when we were taught at a young age about the French colonialist occupier, when the [Syrian] regime pretended to be a champion of national sovereignty,\u201d one of the protesters, a USAID-funded project manager, Abdul Rahman,* told me. \u201cAnd now we got to an unprecedented point, in which we ask an occupier to protect us, and we fail to obtain this [protection]. And protect us from whom? From the criminals of our own country.\u201d\n\nThe fast-moving events over the past two weeks in northeastern Syria, precipitated by a green light from President Trump for a Turkish invasion, left the Syrian Democratic Forces\u2014a diverse group of factions aligned with the U.S. coalition against ISIS and, on occasion, Damascus\u2014scrambling for a reprieve from the Turkish onslaught. Rather than endure further mass displacement from northern Syria, the SDF chose to strike a deal with the Assad regime, leading to the return of Syrian soldiers to areas the SDF previously controlled. While the plight of minority Kurds in these regions has been well documented, the return of Assad\u2019s forces is also a terrifying prospect for other activists, NGO workers, and fighters\u2014Arabs, Kurds and Assyrians\u2014currently residing in SDF-held areas, which encompass about a third of Syrian land and are home to over 3.2 million people. By abruptly deciding to withdraw from the region, the Trump administration not only exposed thousands of people to the threat of arrest in Assad\u2019s torture dungeons, but also left them precious little time to plan their escape.\n\n\u201cTo leave them there is to willfully condemn some of these people to death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know the risk [to NGO workers] is not theoretical; it is very concrete, given the regime\u2019s track record,\u201d said Sasha Ghosh-Siminoff, the executive director of People Demand Change, an organization providing monitoring and research services for international donors operating in SDF-held areas. \u201cIt is incumbent upon the U.S. to protect them and, if necessary, help them leave the country to a safer place.\u201d He proposed rapidly taking money earmarked for projects and using it to relocate endangered staff. \u201cTo leave them there,\u201d he added, \u201cis to willfully condemn some of these people to death.\u201d\n\nSince the deal between the Syrian regime and the SDF was first announced on October 13, protests erupted in Arab-majority cities and towns like Deir Ezzor and Tabqa, farther west up the Euphrates. A general strike took place in Manbij, a town in the Aleppo Governorate in northern Syria, where Russian forces now occupy a base once held by the Americans.", "description": "While coverage has focused on the plight of Kurds, more Syrian locals and NGO workers face arrest and torture in the vacuum Trump created.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Tsurkov"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/48537d6bf4d28825ab78b601242b70ecb494b59a.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
