I didn\u2019t think the left was so mean. I didn\u2019t think the left lied like this,\u201d Ms. Williamson told the New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick in an interview published Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI thought the right did that,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought we were better.\u201d\n\nMr. Remnick had asked Ms. Williamson to weigh in on what she\u2019s learned this year, citing the ousider candidate\u2019s portrayal by the media as a \u201ccrystal gazing kook\u201d for her peace and love approach to policy.\n\nMs. Williamson took umbrage at the interviewer\u2019s \u201ccrystal gazing\u201d remark, declaring that \u201cthere is no crystal\u201d in her home.\n\n\u201cThere is no crystal in my home, David,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a crystal on stage when I\u2019ve talked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never told an AIDS patient not to take their medicine,\u201d she continued, citing the myriad criticisms she\u2019s faced on the campaign trail. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone not to take their medicine. I\u2019ve never told anyone that their lovelessness created their disease. I never told anyone they could love enough to cure their disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jewish, I go to the doctor,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile Ms. Williamson became the most Googled candidate in 49 of 50 states after the second Democratic primary debate, she has not qualified for the third round and will not appear at the debate in Houston next week.\n\nThe bestselling author is currently polling at 0.5%, according to the Real Clear Politics national average.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
