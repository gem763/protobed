I have generally cast doubt on the administration\u2019s ability to use threats, bluffs, lowball offers and other harsh bargaining tactics to advance U.S. interests.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is one area where my skepticism proved unfounded, however, and it led to perhaps the Trump administration\u2019s greatest foreign policy accomplishment in its first thousand days. I speak, of course, of the Universal Postal Union.\n\nLast year the Trump administration announced its intention to withdraw from the UPU this October unless the oldest international body in existence engaged in some serious reforms of how postal carriers could charge for foreign shipments \u2014 fees set by the UPU. As I observed at the time, the United States had a legitimate beef with the way that terminal dues and transit charges were set by that organization. Long story short, the rates privileged developing countries, giving manufacturing powerhouses like China a leg up in their ability to ship small parcels such as cellphones or pharmaceuticals to the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration threat to withdraw was designed to jump-start the UPU\u2019s efforts to reform this system, a daunting task for a multilateral organization not known for rapid response. As is typical of a multilateral institution like this one, changing these rates takes time and patience. Last October, I was pretty skeptical that this gambit would work and warned that the UPU provided lots of other benefits to the United States in areas like combating narcotics trafficking that would be painful to give up. This was a risky strategy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn September, the UPU met in its third extraordinary congress. The White House\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro represented the United States. This did not augur well. When the UPU rejected the United States\u2019 preferred outcome, that seemed bad.\n\nAnd here is where I must repent, because credit here is due: The Trump administration\u2019s strategy worked out pretty well. The New York Times\u2019s Nick Cumming-Bruce provides a clear rundown:\n\nThe United States agreed on Wednesday to stay in a United Nations body that has regulated international mail service for more than a century after delegates agreed during emergency talks to change the way postal fees are structured.... The deal struck on Wednesday will allow the United States to start setting its own postal fees in July and allow other countries that receive more than 75,000 metric tons of mail a year to start phasing in higher rates in January 2021.... Delegates from about 140 countries stood to applaud as Bishar Hussein, the head of the Universal Postal Union, said the new formula had passed. Only a day earlier, he had warned that a United States withdrawal could lead to chaos in international mail service.... Peter Navarro, President Trump\u2019s trade adviser, said the decision was a \u201chuge victory for millions of American workers and businesses\u201d and would save the United States between $300 million and $500 million a year.\n\nClearly, other countries felt similarly to the United States on the unfair nature of the prior status quo, and the Trump administration\u2019s threat to withdraw was exactly the shock to the system that the UPU needed. Outside assessments agree that this is a clear win for U.S. interests. The result is \u2014 and I am not exaggerating when I say this \u2014 the greatest foreign economic policy accomplishment in the Trump presidency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI did not think the Trump administration would be able to pull this off. I was wrong, and I ask forgiveness.\n\nOf course, the catch is that a roughly $400 million win should not be an administration\u2019s greatest accomplishment in foreign economic policy. And yet this is where we are. The renegotiated U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement was a nothingburger. USMCA remains NAFTA-minus \u2014 and unratified. The much-ballyhooed U.S.-Japan trade deal is a pale reflection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Chinese continue to not make any significant concessions in their trade talks with the Trump administration. And the less said about negotiations with North Korea, the better.\n\nIt would be a mistake for the Trump White House to generalize from its UPU victory to other economic negotiations. Not all bargaining situations are created equal. But it is also true that the Trump administration\u2019s hawkish approach to the status quo paid off in the case of the UPU. My apologies for getting this case wrong.\n\nAD", "description": "The Trump administration's greatest foreign policy accomplishment involves stamps.", "authors": ["Daniel W. Drezner", "Daniel W.
