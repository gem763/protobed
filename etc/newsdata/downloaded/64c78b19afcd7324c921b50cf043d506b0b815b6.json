It\u2019s giving her energy and she\u2019s able to do things with her son.\"\n\nDespite the gloomy prognosis of her doctors, Megan is not giving up hope.\n\nShe is due to meet someone who survived the same tumour and a diagnosis of three months to live back in September 2017.\n\nEncouraged by partner Paul Sweeney, brother Paul and her mum, Megan is also looking at alternative therapies through the private market.\n\n\u201cThis is the way forward for Megan but it doesn\u2019t come cheaply,\" Denise added.\n\n\"The average cost of her treatment, including supplements to help with her radiation therapies, is about \u00a3300/350 a month which we have been funding ourselves.\n\n\u201cThis is why we\u2019re organising this fundraiser.\n\n\"We\u2019re not a family who usually asks for help of this nature, but nor are we a family who are too proud to realise when we need help, and we need it now.\"\n\nTo view the fundraising page click here.", "description": "Megan Lavery from Glasgow was given the devastating news after she gave birth to baby Roan", "authors": ["Jane Hamilton", "Milo Boyd"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728076.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Megan-Lavery.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
