In Tobias Smollett \u2019s picaresque novel of 1751, \u201cThe Adventures of Peregrine Pickle,\u201d a character complains that he was \u201chussled by those rebellious rapscallions.\u201d Members of a pickpocketing gang could be called \u201chustlers,\u201d as in an 1824 account of a London robbery trial in which a shady character was said to be \u201cknown as a hustler.\u201d\n\n\u201c The tension between honorable hard work and less-than-honorable undertakings has made \u2018hustler\u2019 a peculiarly dichotomous term. \u201d\n\nWhen \u201chustle\u201d and \u201chustler\u201d crossed the Atlantic into American slang, they were applied to various criminal enterprises, such as thievery and prostitution. But the words also developed more positive connotations, having to do with energetically and ambitiously pursuing one\u2019s goals. In 1880, for instance, a young man placed an advertisement in the St. Louis Dispatch looking for a job, touting himself as a \u201cthorough worker, well posted, and good hustler.\u201d An 1883 article in the Detroit Free Press about young lawyers in the city explained that to find business one must be a \u201chustler.\u201d A \u201chustler\u201d was defined in the article as \u201ca chap who hunts up work, digs it out, yet always maintains his dignity and behaves honorably.\u201d\n\nThat tension\u2014between honorable hard work on the one hand and less-than-honorable undertakings on the other\u2014has continued to make \u201chustler\u201d a peculiarly dichotomous term. In the title role of the 1961 film \u201cThe Hustler,\u201d Paul Newman plays the pool shark \u201cFast\u201d Eddie Felson, who engages in small-time hustling\u2014using deceptive techniques to win money from less experienced players\u2014but aspires to graduate to the ranks of high-stakes gamblers. The hustler who skirts the edges of legitimacy is also an iconic figure in rap music, in songs like Ice-T\u2019s \u201cNew Jack Hustler\u201d and Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Knock the Hustle.\u201d\n\nThe women at the center of \u201cHustlers\u201d\u2014mirroring their real-life counterparts depicted in a 2015 New York Magazine article, \u201cThe Hustlers at Scores\u201d\u2014come up with their own type of hustle as a way to turn the tables on powerful men. The movie, in a sense, reclaims the word \u201chustler,\u201d since the dancers on which the story is based sometimes worked at the Hustler Club, part of the chain of strip clubs founded by Larry Flynt of Hustler magazine fame.\n\nAnd as writer-director Lorene Scafaria told the Associated Press, the movie itself is a kind of hustle, since it plays with preconceptions of strippers and their typical cinematic depictions. \u201cThat\u2019s the hustle,\u201d Ms. Scafaria said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re subverting expectations but subverting them in a way that has some nuance to it.\u201d", "description": "From the late 1600s to the hit movie with Jennifer Lopez, the hard-working term has straddled the border between legality and illegality", "authors": ["Ben Zimmer", "Bgzimmer Wsj Gmail.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FA317_WORDST_SOC_20190919103931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
