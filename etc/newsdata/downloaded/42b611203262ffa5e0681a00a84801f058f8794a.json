Or at least owning them?\n\nIn reality, those stranded on foreign shores have more immediate concerns, such as how the hell they\u2019re going to get home.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut it might just occur to some of them after they\u2019ve landed and are contemplating ruined holidays/weddings/celebrations, miserable families, high blood pressure and/or waits of two months or longer to get refunds.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at some of the arguments you might see deployed to explain why what\u2019s good for the goose isn\u2019t so good for the gander.\n\nArgument number one was put forward by Shapps. A keen-eyed Cook customer could shoot it down with the help of Google. Details of the government\u2019s majority (currently more than 60 per cent) stake in RBS are readily available. It has owned most of the bank for more than a decade. So that puts paid to that one.\n\nArgument number two is that the banks that broke during the financial crisis could have brought the entire global financial system crashing down, taking the entire UK economy with it (not to mention lots of other economies). It was a special situation.\n\nThe pictures of stranded and miserable holidaymakers might very well lead you to the conclusion that this is a similarly special situation, and one that would have cost a lot less to resolve.\n\nA lot of wild and woolly figures have been bandied about when it comes to how much the government spent on supporting the banking system when it was teetering on the brink. Some (including Jeremy Hunt) have talked about \u00a31 trillion. The reality is that it was somewhat less than that. Fact-checking charity Full Fact puts it at \u00a3137bn, which includes the direct state aid used to bail out RBS (about \u00a345bn) and the since returned to private hands Lloyds (\u00a320bn). Needless to say, that\u2019s still a hell of a lot of money.\n\nSet against that, the \u00a3200m Thomas Cook reportedly required to keep the wolves from its door is a mere rounding error. Ah but, the government would say, that\u2019s all well and good but we would have been back here again in a couple of months\u2019 time.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It was bailed out via a multi-stage process: we taxpayers pumped in some cash. Then we pumped in some more.\n\nA substantial amount of the money spent on supporting the banks during the financial crisis has been recouped. But RBS chairman Sir Howard Davies has admitted the taxpayer won\u2019t fully recover the \u00a345bn of good money sunk into RBS to keep it afloat.\n\nArgument number four is that if the government helped Thomas Cook it\u2019d have to do it for everyone.\n\nBut, again, RBS, and its \u201cspecial situation\u201d. It\u2019s a bit too late for that. The principle has been established.\n\nWe\u2019ll doubtless hear lots more like those four over the coming days. At some point, someone will no doubt try to blame the EU. That\u2019s what they usually do. And, well, LOOK AT RBS.\n\nThe trouble is that when you drill it down, RBS and Thomas Cook really aren\u2019t all that different.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Simple. The former was too big to fail. The latter was not. That, together with some politics, is about it.\n\nSo, yes, Thomas Cook\u2019s customers, and thousands of workers, have every right to feel very angry, not least because among the lending banks that finally pulled the plug were, drum roll please...
