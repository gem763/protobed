The injury prompted immediate speculation from the Panthers\u2019 hometown newspaper, the Charlotte Observer, regarding whether Newton\u2019s vegan lifestyle had exacerbated the situation.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the collective bargaining agreement or the uniform player contract that comes close to regulating a player\u2019s diet,\u201d Michael LeRoy, a sports labor law expert and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told FOX Business. \u201cIn the CBA, there is a contract article for meal allowances when a team travels. It has no restrictions.\u201d\n\nNFL teams invest heavily in training staffs, nutritionists and chefs to ensure that players have access to all the food and nutrients they need to succeed over a months-long season. However, franchises can\u2019t interfere with a player\u2019s personal dieting choices, LeRoy said.\n\nNewton, who announced in a video last March that he had adopted a vegan menu in order to slim down to 235 pounds, is the latest of countless NFL players and athletes to draw scrutiny over their diet. When quarterback Colin Kaepernick became a free agent following a 2017 season in which he led national anthem protests, a report from NBC Sports Bay Area suggested that teams were skeptical of his commitment to football in part because of his vegan diet.\n\nOther prominent NFL players to go vegan include Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Tony Gonzalez and at least 11 members of the 2017 Tennessee Titans.\n\nA group of sports nutritionists, dietitians and athletic trainers told the Observer that a switch to veganism could impact Newton\u2019s intake of vital protein and calories, which could, in theory, affect his ability to recover.\n\n\u201cGo back to 2015 Cam, bada-- Cam. He was a pescatarian,\u201d Chris Howard, a local certified nutritionist and strength and conditioning coach, told the newspaper. \u201cSalmon, shrimp, you get a lot of good fats and complete proteins. In fact, [fish] is one of the best protein sources there is.\"\n\n\u201cNow you take away the most valuable part of that (diet), and ... there\u2019s just no way around it: He can\u2019t recover as well with less nutrients, with less calories and with less muscle mass. It\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d Howard added.\n\nWhile NFL teams can\u2019t regulate the dieting habits of their players, they can seek to incentivize them to play at a certain weight. The Seattle Seahawks famously included offered bonuses to former running back Eddie Lacy if he managed to hit certain weight loss targets.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nOther than that, each player\u2019s nutrition habits are their own.\n\n\u201cWhether a player eats only organic vegetables or loads up on milkshakes, the contract pays per diem rates for breakfast, lunch, and dinner,\u201d LeRoy added. \u201cThe uniform player contract has vague language on making a full disclosure of \u2018any physical or mental condition known to him which might impair his performance under this contract.\u2019 A diet is not a physical or mental condition, so Newton\u2019s diet does not seem to be implicated here.\u201d", "description": "Newton, who announced in a video last March that he had adopted a vegan menu in order to slim down to 235 pounds, is the latest of countless NFL players and athletes to draw scrutiny over their diet.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Cam-Newton.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
