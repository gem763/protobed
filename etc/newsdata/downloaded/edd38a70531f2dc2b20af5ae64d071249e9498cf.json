Sucks for them but innocent enough, right?\n\nWrong. The reason why they start to experience this allergy will make your skin crawl.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThat's because if you're drinking coffee made from pre-ground beans, there's also a pretty high chance you're swigging down ground-up cockroaches.\n\nUniversity of Montana biology professor Douglas Emlen first spilt the beans on the gross finding in a 2009 interview about his research into dung beetles, as reported by news.com.au .\n\nDr Emlen described how, as a student, he drove across the country with his professor who was 'fiercely addicted to caffeine' and often made them drive up to 45 minutes off route to find somewhere that served whole bean fresh ground coffee.\n\n\"I remember giving him a really hard time because we were wasting a lot of travel time trying to feed his addiction because he needed a coffee every couple of hours,\" said Dr Emlen.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\n\"And he finally explained to me he had to drink only whole bean fresh ground coffee \u2014 and it was because of cockroaches.\"\n\nAfter years of teaching entomology, the study of insects and their relationships with humans, the professor became badly allergic to cockroaches from handling them so often.\n\nHe couldn't touch a cockroach without getting a reaction and suffered similarly when he drank coffee made from pre-ground beans.\n\nWhen the professor looked into it he found pre-ground coffee is all processed from huge stock piles which get infested with cockroaches.\n\nHe explained that little can be done to filter out the creatures, so they all get ground up along with the beans. Feeling ill yet? Here's a little more.\n\nDr Emlen said at the the time US defect standards allowed coffee beans to contain as much as 10 per cent 'insect filth and insects'.\n\nThen he dropped the bombshell that chocolate, with the huge piles of cocoa beans, suffers a very similar fate.\n\nWe'll be in the corner crying if you need us.", "description": "This might turn you off from drinking tins of pre-ground coffee beans ever again", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20677760.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Cockroach-on-the-board.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
