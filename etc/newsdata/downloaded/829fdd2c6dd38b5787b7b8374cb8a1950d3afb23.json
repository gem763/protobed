In All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator, journalists Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy draw on over 100 interviews, many of them exclusive, to craft a detailed history of Trump's relationships with women, stretching back to his childhood and education as well as his rise through real estate, entertainment, and politics. What emerges from the authors' reporting is a portrait of a predator who hides behind wealth and institutional power to frequently harass and abuse women.\n\nWhile the president has publicly faced allegations from two dozen women, this book reveals another 43 allegations of alleged inappropriate behavior, including 26 instances of unwanted sexual contact. In this exclusive excerpt from All the President's Women, Levine and El-Faizy investigate an alleged wave of unwanted touching that preceded his proposal to Melania Knauss, including a disturbing instance of groping at Mar-a-Lago. \u2014Adrienne Westenfeld\n\nIn 1998, Sam Mendes packed the old Henry Miller Theater at Forty-Third Street and Broadway with round black cabaret chairs and tables dotted with red tasseled table lamps and installed banquettes and a bar, thus transforming it into the Kit Kat Club for the second Broadway revival ofCabaret, a musical about the rise of Nazis in 1930s Germany. \u201cIt\u2019s rough, it\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s in your face,\u201d Mendes said of the new Weimar-styled nightclub-cum-cabaret-cum-theater. Perhaps fittingly, it was there that Donald Trump, who would eventually have his own political rise, met an inscrutable twenty-eight-year-old brunette with steel-blue eyes who would be the star of the second revival of his role as married man.\n\nThe third Broadway staging of Cabaret was a huge hit and opened the door to Mendes\u2019s career as a film director\u2014and it seems Trump has had success his third time around as well. In Melania Knauss, he found his best match, a woman who seemed to combine first wife Ivana\u2019s Eastern European love of a strongman with second wife Marla Maples\u2019s homey attitude.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is a creature of habit, and the story of how he met the Slovenian model Knauss rings familiar. In 1998, when he had been separated from Maples for about a year, he went to the Kit Kat Club for a party for a Victoria\u2019s Secret model with Norwegian heiress Celina Midelfart, who was in her mid-twenties and living in Trump Tower while studying at New York University, as his date. According to Trump\u2019s account, he was meant to be introduced to another model that night, but Melania caught his eye. \u201cI went crazy,\u201d he told Larry King during an interview the CNN host conducted with newlyweds Donald and Melania in 2005. \u201cThere was this great supermodel sitting next to Melania. I was supposed to meet this supermodel. They said, \u2018Look, there\u2019s so and so.\u2019 I said, \u201cForget about her. Who is the one on the left?\u2019 And it was Melania.\u201d Melania was twenty-eight at the time and had been invited to the party by her friend and agent, Paolo Zampolli. When Midelfart absented herself to use the restroom, Trump seized the opportunity to hit on Melania.\n\nAfter chatting her up, Trump asked Melania for her number, but she refused to give it to him, asking for his instead. She was impressed when he gave her all his numbers\u2014the office, Mar-a-Lago, all of it, she later told Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Their courtship began with a few dinners together in New York. It didn\u2019t take more than a month before she was boarding his private jet to fly to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nOf course, Melania wasn\u2019t the only woman in Trump\u2019s life during his separation from Marla. Trump was also seeing two well-known models, Maureen Gallagher and Kara Young. Gallagher, who has never publicly acknowledged her romance with Trump before being interviewed for this book, dated Trump in the late 1990s, after he had already started seeing Young. Gallagher said she found the titan genuine\u2014and genuinely interested in her as a person. \u201cWe had really great conversations, we talked about all kinds of stuff\u2014mostly about sports and dreams and hopes and where we\u2019re going with this whole thing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wanted to push me. He always wanted to push me to do better.\u201d According to Gallagher, she and Trump would have dinner in the private dining room at Mar-a-Lago, and sometimes she would go down on her own and stay in his daughter Ivanka\u2019s room. \u201cI could always use the spa,\u201d she said. And when she decided to move to Miami, he took care of that for her, flying her bike and everything she needed down to Palm Beach and then trucking it down to Ocean Drive in Miami for her.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Bei/Shutterstock More\n\nGallagher had other men in her life, too, and wasn\u2019t looking to settle down with Trump, so was unable to give him the kind of affirmation he seemed to need. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018You love me, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re in love with me?\u2019 And I was like, He\u2019s a megalomaniac. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was like, \u2018I like fucking you.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t spend enough time with you to be in love with you.\u2019 I told him straight up... I\u2019m having fun.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Young was something different. She was the one Trump really fell for. He saw Gallagher behind the scenes. He took Young out in public. And it was Young who had Trump\u2019s credit card. \u201cI knew everyone in SoHo. They were like, \u2018She was just here with his card,\u2019\u201d Gallagher said.\n\nTrump\u2019s feelings for Young had been so real that he had asked her to marry him before they had even been together a year, celebrity reporter A.J. Benza revealed in an interview for this book. Young, whose son from her first marriage was still an infant at the time, turned Trump down. \u201cI do know he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer for a while,\u201d said Benza, who had also dated Gallagher. \u201cAnd he made numerous attempts.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Time & Life Pictures More\n\nOf all the women Trump dated after Maples, it was Young whom Melania viewed as the biggest threat. \u201cShe knew Donald thought differently about [Young] than the way he casually would date other women in the city,\u201d Benza said. \u201cMelania knew he treated Kara differently. This was a girl he stayed home with, ate at home with and watched movies... It was very domesticated.\u201d\n\nEarly on in her relationship with Trump, Melania learned the hard way that he was not completely finished with Young, a source close to Young told us. \u201cMelania came home and saw [what was] not her makeup on a bathroom towel. She flipped out. A big fight ensued,\u201d Young\u2019s friend said. \u201cThey flew her back to Mar-a-Lago.\u201d The source told us that Melania was allegedly suffering from a health issue and had gone down to Mar-a-Lago to recuperate. She eventually forgave Trump. Melania\u2019s former roommate said they broke up over \u201ctrust issues\u201d after he went \u201cback to his old ways.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey got back together a few months later, but Trump apparently hadn\u2019t abandoned those old habits. In the period before he proposed to Melania, Trump engaged in a wave of allegedly unwanted touching. One of those incidents happened during a Mar-a-Lago New Year\u2019s Eve party in the early 2000s. Karen Johnson spoke publicly about the events of that night for the first time in an interview with us.\n\n\n\nJohnson said she was at Trump\u2019s Palm Beach estate that night with her husband, who was suffering from multiple sclerosis, and another relative. The family visited the seaside club regularly; Johnson and her husband had even held their wedding reception there a few years earlier. Trump, whom she didn\u2019t know before her wedding, had \u201cchased some of my bridesmaids around,\u201d said Johnson, but he had been \u201cnice\u201d to her.\n\nPhoto credit: New York Daily News Archive More\n\nAt the New Year\u2019s Eve party, Johnson, wearing a black Versace dress, danced with her friends. Shortly after glittering balloons fell from the ceiling at the stroke of midnight, her husband said he wasn\u2019t feeling well and the relative was ready to go. Johnson decided to make a quick trip to the restroom before they headed home. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen [Trump] that whole entire night,\u201d said Johnson, who was in her late thirties at the time. \u201cI was just walking to the bathroom. I was grabbed and pulled behind a tapestry, and it was him. And I\u2019m a tall girl and I had six-inch heels on, and I still remember looking up at him. And he\u2019s strong, and he just kissed me,\u201d she recounted to us. \u201cI was so scared because of who he was... I don\u2019t even know where it came from. I didn\u2019t have a say in the matter.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohnson said Trump then grabbed her hand and said, \u201cYou have to help me greet these guests out,\u201d explaining that Melania was upstairs. \u201cSo I stood next to him while he greeted some guests out the door,\u201d Johnson said. She didn\u2019t let on that anything was amiss because she didn\u2019t want to create an awkward situation. \u201cI was afraid to say what had happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how it happened.\u201d\n\nDocumentation and photographs corroborate Johnson\u2019s general description of the evening. A friend also said Johnson told him about the encounter years before Trump ran for office.\n\nIn the days after the incident, Trump began pursuing Johnson. \u201cHe started calling me. I answered my phone and he said, \u2018Do you know who this is?\u2019 And I knew his voice. And I was wondering how he got my phone number,\u201d she said. He called her regularly for the next week or two, she told us, offering to fly her up to New York to visit him. Johnson told Trump she couldn\u2019t because she was taking care of her dying husband. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, he\u2019ll never know you were gone,\u201d she said Trump told her. \u201cHe said he\u2019d have me back by six o\u2019clock. This was like crazy. He was going to fly me to New York for the day to see him. I said, \u2018No, no, no.\u2019\u201d But Trump persisted. When he was in Florida, he called and said he would send a car to bring her to Mar-a-Lago. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018No, no, no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was scared. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nIn time, Johnson said, the calls stopped. She never went back to Mar-a-Lago. She eventually told the relative who was with her at the New Year\u2019s Eve party what had happened, but she never told her dying husband. Years later, Johnson was shocked to hear Trump describing on the Access Hollywood tape exactly what he had done to her. \u201cWhen he says that thing, \u2018Grab them in the pussy,\u2019 that hits me hard because when he grabbed me and pulled me into the tapestry, that\u2019s where he grabbed me\u2014he grabbed me there in my front and pulled me in,\u201d she told us.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied all of the accusations against him that have previously been made public. He has said the sexual misconduct allegations against him are made up and politically motivated. He has accused women who have made accusations against him of seeking fame. He has said the allegations don\u2019t make sense\u2014he never would have been in a nightclub alone, for example, or that an accuser is not physically attractive enough to warrant his attention. \u201cLook at her. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said of one at a 2016 rally in Florida. \u201cBelieve me, she would not be my first choice,\u201d he said of another at a North Carolina rally that same year. But what hurts accusers even more than Trump\u2019s verbal assaults is being treated as though they are worthless.\n\n\n\nLike other women who say they were sexually assaulted by Trump, Johnson hesitated to tell anyone about her experience. \u201cI feared that because I had been a dancer many years before they would say to me, \u2018Well, you must have asked for it,\u2019\u201d she told us. \u201cWhat he did was very traumatizing to me,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cAnd it still is. You know, I didn\u2019t ask for that. I was literally just walking through a room... no matter what my past is I don\u2019t deserve to be treated that way.\u201d Despite her fears about not being believed, she is clear that she didn\u2019t bring the assault on herself. \u201cThis is about a monster, an immature child running around who has no respect for anybody but himself and his giant ego,\u201d she said.\n\nAs one of the oldest of his accusers, Jessica Leeds, who alleged during the 2016 presidential campaign that Trump had groped her on an airplane decades earlier, has some perspective. \u201cI spout off about a lot of these men [who are accused of sexual impropriety], and a lot of them are wealthy, powerful, or consider themselves important. They work for major companies. For them it\u2019s like scratching an itch. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. But the psychological damage they can do to the person they are inflicting aggression on is profound.\u201d\n\nFrom the book ALL THE PRESIDENT'S WOMEN: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator by Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy.
