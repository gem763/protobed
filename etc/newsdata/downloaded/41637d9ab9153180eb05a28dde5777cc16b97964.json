She went in for a simple procedure which was to remove a cyst in the left thigh.\"\n\nAndrew Katz/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nRubenstein said Abreu was in perfectly good health otherwise. He believes the hospital either administered too much anesthesia or the administration of the anesthesia was improperly monitored.\n\nAbreu's mother, Dorah Restituyo, was overcome with emotion Friday at a press conference.\n\n\"They killed my daughter. They killed her. I don't know why. I don't know what happened to my daughter,\" Restituyo said.\n\nIn a statement emailed to ABC News, a hospital spokesperson for New York City Health + Hospitals said: \"The health and safety of our patients is always our number one priority. This incident is tragic, and we offer our sincere condolences to the family and loved ones. Patient privacy and confidentiality laws prevent us from commenting further on this case.\"", "description": "Rosemary Abreu went to have her cyst removed but the procedure turned fatal.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hospital-01-as-gty-191019_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
