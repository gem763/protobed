She said: \u2018To make sure it looked authentic we dyed it in Yorkshire Tea (the strongest, as we all know).\n\n\u2018We placed each piece of lace in a small bowl from the dressers\u2019 kitchen, filled with cool water and a tea bag and left it for about five minutes, checking regularly until the colour was perfect.\u2019\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with Prince George and Princess Charlotte for the christening of Prince Louis at Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, London, last year\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge with Princess Charlotte in the christening gown at the Church of St Mary Magdalene\n\nMrs Kelly, who was assisted on the project by dressmaker Barbara Buckfield, said the Queen was shown each stage of the process of making the gown, and was \u2018very interested\u2019 to see how it took shape as the sleeves and then the skirt with the under-layers on were attached.\n\nThe replica gown took about nine months to complete. It was first used for the christening of James, Viscount Severn \u2013 Prince Edward\u2019s youngest child \u2013 in 2008 and was worn most recently by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s son Archie in July.\n\nThe original, made by Janet Sutherland, was made of Spitalfields silk and Honiton lace. It was worn by 62 royal babies including the then Princess Elizabeth at her christening held at Buckingham Palace in May 1926. The Queen commissioned a replica of the original in 2004 after reportedly deeming the original too fragile for further use.", "description": "The royal christening gown worn by Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis was dyed in Yorkshire Tea, dressmaker Angela Kelly reveals.
