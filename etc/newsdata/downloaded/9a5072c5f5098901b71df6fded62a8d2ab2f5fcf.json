Another found that the ingredients can possibly lead to \u201ccoral reef bleaching,\u201d potentially shortening their lifespan, and when found in fish, may affect the food chain.\n\n\u201cIt really is for the survival of our coral reefs and fishery,\u201d Stewart told Fox35. If the bill passes, it would go into effect in July 2020.\n\nBut not everyone is happy about the proposed bill, with some dermatologists arguing that making it harder to access sunscreen can have negative consequences. \u201cWe know that these ingredients that she\u2019s trying to ban are in like 70 to 80 percent of all commercially available sunscreens,\u201d J. Matthew Knight, MD, the president of the Florida Society of Dermatology and Dermatologic Surgery, told Fox35. \u201cIt\u2019s way too soon on something like this. We feel like it\u2019s a terrible idea.\u201d\n\nKnight added that restricting access to sunscreen would \u201cincrease the melanoma epidemic in our state.\u201d\n\nJeremy Fenton, MD, a dermatologist with the Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City, agrees: \u201cMaking some types of sunscreens by prescription only may reduce the use of sunscreen overall, leading to an increase in skin cancer,\u201d Fenton tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cSunscreens are the most important tool in preventing skin cancer, which can be deadly. Anything that restricts or places a barrier to access could have a negative impact on the health of many patients.\u201d\n\nFenton continues: \u201cRequiring people to go to their doctor to get a prescription for sunscreen could also increase cost in the healthcare system and restrict access to sunscreen if people have limited or costly healthcare.\u201d\n\nHowever, Fenton also acknowledges the potential harm in using these chemicals. \u201cThere are some ingredients in sunscreen that are possibly harmful to the coral reefs, and we must balance the availability of these products along with protecting our environment,\u201d he says. \u201cThese include two common ingredients that are targeted in this bill: oxybenzone and octinoxate. The data, however, is controversial, and the American Academy of Dermatology\u2019s official statement is that the environmental risks have not been proven.\u201d\n\nSusan Massick, MD, a dermatologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the proposed legislation is \u201cmisguided.\u201d \u201cThere is no doubt that coral reefs around the world are dying, and efforts must be made to save them and to protect the environment,\u201d says Massick, who adds that we need additional research on the potential relationship between chemical sunscreens and coral reefs to establish a true cause and effect. \u201cHowever, requiring prescriptions for certain sunscreens will not necessarily provide greater protection for coral reefs and may, in fact, create a greater health impact.\u201d\n\nMassick explains that one of the most effective ways to prevent skin cancer is to avoid sunburns and excessive sun exposure. \u201cSun protection, such as the use of sunscreens, can have a true impact for skin cancer prevention, especially those related to ultraviolet sun exposure, like basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, and the potentially more aggressive form of skin cancer, melanoma. Restricting use of these products by prescription only may lead people to forego use of sunscreen completely over the use of alternative products.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, for those looking for alternatives, there are a few \u2014 namely, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide-based sunscreens. \u201cThese sunscreens not only present a much lower risk of harm to the environment, but also provide some of the best broad spectrum sun protection,\u201d says Fenton. \u201cAlthough the best sunscreen is the one that you are going to use regularly, I always recommend my patients choose a zinc oxide sunscreen for a number of reasons. Zinc oxide provides excellent full spectrum UVA and UVB protection, does not degrade with sun exposure, and is less likely to irritate the skin or induce an allergic reaction.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A Florida state senator proposed a bill requiring a prescription for most sunscreens \u2013 but some experts say it could lead to people not using sunscreen, upping the risk of skin cancer.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ej.lIdQFxDHnyOXBBDi2Hg--~B/aD01MzA0O3c9Nzk1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/e9a3e2a0-ef73-11e9-bc34-071043ddbbbc", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
