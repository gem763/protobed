However, with the rise of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, many people are making it their goal to retire well before their mid-60s. Retiring early might sound like a dream come true, but it takes a lot of preparation to be financially ready for it.\n\nHow can you retire early? To help you plan, we gathered the best advice from financial experts on how to make your early retirement dreams a reality.\n\nLast updated: Sept. 23, 2019\n\nMake Small Changes That Add Up Over Time\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest lies we\u2019re told is that financial freedom requires a six-figure salary and a lot of luck,\u201d said Rob Berger, Forbes deputy editor and author of \u201cRetire Before Mom and Dad.\u201d \u201cIn truth, even small changes with how we spend, save and invest money applied consistently over time can put us on the path to financial freedom.\u201d\n\nStart Planning Right Away\n\nThose wishing to retire early should get started on the process as soon as they can, said John Bergquist, senior founding partner at Common Sense Financial in South Jordan, Utah.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose if you want to comfortably retire at normal retirement age, let alone early, so you must act on your goal immediately,\u201d Bergquist said. \u201cSeeking help with this plan from a financial professional will also help a great deal, as they will help you realistically look at factors such as rates of return, inflation and the potential impact taxes could have on your goals.\u201d\n\nDetermine What Kind of Lifestyle You Want in Retirement\n\nChris Hogan, the author of \u201cEveryday Millionaires,\u201d outlined several steps to early retirement on Dave Ramsey\u2019s blog. The first step is to figure out what kind of lifestyle you plan on having once you retire.\n\n\u201cBefore you do any calculations to determine how to retire early, you need to know what you think you\u2019ll do in retirement,\u201d Hogan wrote. \u201cThat dream will determine your budget. Want to travel the world? Then you\u2019ll need a big budget. Want to travel to see grandkids? Open a business? Do volunteer work? Take the family on a huge vacation? Each of these dreams carries a different price tag.\u201d\n\nFigure Out Where You Want To Live in Retirement\n\nWhere you choose to retire \u2014 and what kind of housing you plan to live in \u2014 will greatly affect how much savings you\u2019ll need. Be sure to ask yourself the following questions before you retire, Hogan advised: \u201cThink about where you want to live. Is it your current location? Do you want to downsize? Which states have the highest cost of living? Which states offer the best tax breaks? Do you want to live close to family? You need to decide before you retire. An unplanned move after retirement can deplete your retirement savings.\u201d\n\nDecide If You'll Continue To Work Part Time in Your Retirement\n\nWhether it\u2019s for extra income, to scratch an entrepreneurial itch or to maintain social connections with co-workers, you might choose to continue working in retirement, Hogan noted.\n\n\u201cDo you want to retire completely? Do you want to work part-time and try to start your own business? Do you think you\u2019ll miss the social interaction that work provides?\u201d he wrote on the blog. \u201cThink through these questions before burning your business connections. It\u2019s your future \u2014 but you need to know how you want it to look!\u201d\n\nFigure Out Your Retirement Budget\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out what your retirement will look like, Hogan wrote, you should create a mock retirement budget. Your monthly budget should include gifts and charity giving; utilities; insurance; medical expenses; food; phone and internet; clothing; gas; entertainment; home and car repairs; hobbies; savings for a new car, vacations and gifts; extras; and additional savings.\n\n\u201cYour budget will look different at different phases of your life, like when you drop life insurance and when you add long-term care insurance,\u201d Hogan wrote. \u201cIt will also look different depending on what you want in retirement \u2014 travel, hobbies, volunteering, seeing family.\u201d\n\n\n\nFactor In Health Insurance Costs\n\n\u201cIf you leave a job before you can get on Medicare, then you may need to get private insurance,\u201d Hogan wrote on the blog. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge factor to consider when you\u2019re thinking about how to retire early.\u201d\n\n\n\nStory continues", "description": "You might be able to retire before your 60s if you plan well.", "authors": ["Jaime Catmull"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rnRJbQWTej9Co8CDhHQhkg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/gobankingrates_644/a229a90ccd5f183df1cf18fb36407139", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
