The margin of error is plus and minus 3.1 percentage points.The proportion of those critical of his presidency gained 2 percentage points, reaching 53 percent.Among them, 25 percent cited a lack of resolutions to problems relating to the economy and people\u2019s livelihoods, and 17 percent took issue with the president\u2019s personnel management, apparently including the turmoil over his pick of Cho Kuk as justice minister.\u201cI am doubtful about whether it\u2019s right to respond sensitively to either a rise or a fall in approval ratings and change [policy] direction,\u201d a Blue House official told reporters.The official pointed out that there are various methods of polling and of result analysis.The ruling Democratic Party\u2019s approval rating declined 1 percentage point to 36 percent, while that of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party remained unchanged at 27 percent, Gallup said.Meanwhile, a separate poll conducted by Realmeter showed Moon\u2019s rating had rebounded since Cho stepped down on Monday.It edged up to 45.5 percent in the survey of 1,503 adults across the country from Monday through Wednesday. It marks a 4.1 percent rise from a poll conducted last week. The margin of error is plus and minus 2.5 percentage points.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
