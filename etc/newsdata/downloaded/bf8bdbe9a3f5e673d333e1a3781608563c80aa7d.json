Some are children.\n\nAt least five people, including a Syrian baby, were reportedly killed in Kurdish shelling of Turkish border towns.\n\nActivists from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least 29 deaths among the SDF and 17 from among pro-Turkish Syrian rebels, the Free Syrian Army, as more than 10 villages fell into Turkish hands.\n\nIn a later report they said that seven members of the pro-Turkish forces had been killed as the SDF retook a village in Tal Abyad region, one of them a Turkish soldier.\n\nTurkey's military confirmed a soldier's death, and said three others had been wounded.\n\nTurkey's Anadolu news agency said late on Thursday that 228 Kurdish militants had been \"neutralised\" since the start of the operation.\n\nMeanwhile tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing their homes, and aid agencies fear the exodus could reach hundreds of thousands.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage from the start of the Turkish offensive\n\nTurkey wants to create a \"safe zone\" running for 480km (300 miles) along the Syrian side of the border but says it will not advance deeper than a planned 32km limit.\n\nHow is the offensive affecting people?\n\nSome 64,000 people have already reportedly fled their homes, the International Rescue Committee aid organisation said. The UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, gave a similar figure.\n\nThe IRC's Misty Buswell said: \"If the offensive continues it's possible a total of 300,000 people could be displaced to already overstretched camps and towns still recovering from the fight against IS.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Residents flee their home town of Ras al-Ain\n\nAnother group of 14 humanitarian organisations, including the Mercy Corps, warned the figure could be 450,000.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nThe UN Security Council discussed the situation on Thursday at the request of its current five EU members - the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland.\n\nThe five called on Turkey to halt its military offensive, saying \"renewed armed hostilities in the north-east will further undermine the stability of the whole region, exacerbate civilian suffering and provoke further displacements\".\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed his \"deep concern\" at the rising violence.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: Kurds \"didn't help us in Second World War\"\n\nTurkey for its part said it would take responsibility for the IS prisoners it found during its offensive.\n\nMr Erdogan has strongly defended the incursion, threatening to send some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts to Europe if the Turkish offensive is described as an occupation.\n\nAre you in the affected area?
