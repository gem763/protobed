Millions of businesses and people cannot plan their futures, this paralysis is causing real damage, and the country must move on in 2020.'\n\nBoris Johnson has warned that Jeremy Corbyn and Remainer MPs could block Brexit until next year - as an opinion poll places him 16 points ahead of the opposition\n\nThe majority of Labour MPs are still opposed to the idea of a snap election - which Mr Johnson proposed to take place on December 12 - and Mr Corbyn has insisted he will not agree to one until a No Deal is no longer an option.\n\nMr Johnson would need to secure the backing of two-thirds of MPs in a parliamentary vote on Monday for a pre-Christmas election to take place.\n\nIt emerged yesterday that the Liberal Democrats were ready to offer Johnson a way to sidestep Labour, which could still allow him to secure an election before Christmas .\n\nThe Lib Dems have drawn up a one-page bill which would amend the Fixedterm Parliaments Act to state that the next election will take place on 9 December \u2013 three days earlier than under Johnson\u2019s plans.\n\nIt states the new election date would be cancelled should the EU fail to grant a threemonth Brexit extension.\n\nThe SNP have signalled that they back the plan.\n\nIt comes as Mr Johnson held a 16-point lead over the opposition Labour Party on Sunday, according to an Opinium poll.\n\nAccording to the survey, support for the Conservative Party rose three points since a previous poll eight days ago to stand at 40 per cent, while Labour was unchanged on 24 per cent.\n\nThe pro-European Union Liberal Democrat Party slipped one point to 15 per cent while Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, which could challenge the Conservatives for the support of Brexit backers, was on 10 per cent.\n\nThe majority of Labour MPs are still opposed to the idea of a snap election - which Mr Johnson proposed to take place on December 12 - and Mr Corbyn has insisted he will not back one until a No Deal is no longer an option\n\nJohnson, elected by party members in July to break the deadlock over Brexit, has proposed holding an election on December 12 after he failed to get a divorce deal through parliament in time for the country to leave the European Union on October 31.\n\nLawmakers will vote on Monday on whether to hold the snap election but most opposition parties have indicated they will either abstain or vote against the move, meaning Johnson is unlikely to secure the support of two-thirds of lawmakers that he needs.\n\nBritain is not due to hold a national election until 2022. The poll was conducted between October 23 and 25.", "description": "The Prime Minister insisted the 'country must move on' in 2020 as he said he now fears parliament's move to block Brexit 'could take us to January 31 as least'.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231520-0-image-a-4_1572139171807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
