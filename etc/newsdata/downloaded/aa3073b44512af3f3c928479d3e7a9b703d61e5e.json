He was pronounced dead less than an hour later.\n\nCorporal Joshua Hoole, of Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire, collapsed during an annual gruelling AFT fitness test at Brecon, Wales, on the morning of July 19 in 2016\n\nAn expert told the inquest into the Scot's death yesterday that the temperature gauge gave incorrectly low readings because it was placed in the shade of a building.\n\nUnder army policy, fitness exercises should be stopped if temperatures hit 20C. By the time the course was completed, roughly two hours later, the temperature had risen to about 22C.\n\nIn total, 18 out of a total of 41 soldiers dropped out, collapsed or were withdrawn by the course directing staff on the day.\n\nLance Corporal George Knight also collapsed on the same day, with witnesses saying he blacked out and fell into a hedge around an hour before Cpl Hoole went down.\n\nThe inquest heard about a Ministry of Defence policy document, JSP 539, worked up after the Iraq war to reduce heat injury and heat deaths in soldiers.\n\nThe guidance was intended for medics and commanders on how best to deal with 'heat illness'.\n\nCol Christopher Wright, a military doctor in emergency medicine, said heat illness could produce 'a spectrum' of different symptoms ranging from mild to severe.\n\nThe 26-year-old, who was described as 'fit, capable and determined', rapidly fell back while carrying 25kg, complaining of 'cramps' before collapsing at 8.52am\n\nAt the time, the guidance for any commander who identified heat injuries or illness was to 'carry out a dynamic risk assessment and consider other control measures, including stopping the activity'.\n\nOn Friday, senior coroner Louise Hunt asked Col Wright for his opinion on the collapse of L/Cpl Knight, who had also collapsed.\n\nCol Wright replied: 'I had come to the conclusion that it should have been treated as a suspected heat injury.'\n\nAsked for his basis for that judgment, he said L/Cpl Knight's symptoms, including 'confusion, being described as appearing disorientated and that he fainted'.\n\nOne witness described L/Cpl Knight 'in a bush and in a s**t state'.\n\nCol Wright added: 'There are other causes that could cause these symptoms but given those and the JSP guidance, I felt that should have been described as a suspected heat injury.'\n\nAn expert told the inquest into the Scot's death yesterday that the temperature gauge gave incorrectly low readings because it was placed in the shade of a building\n\nHe said it would be down to the 'medic or first aider' who had first treated L/Cpl Knight, to identify heat as the possible culprit.\n\nThe inquest has already heard that the AFT continued, and more soldiers continued to drop out or be withdrawn.\n\nAsked what he would have expected to have happened following the policy guidance, if a potential heat injury had been identified, Col Wright said 'the exercise has to stop'.\n\n'The soldiers should be divested of equipment and clothing, placed in the shade, and the primary cooling method is tepid cooling, where water is poured over the patient,' he added.\n\n'The patient should proceed to further care and triage to the medical centre and, if necessary, hospital.'\n\nHe added: 'That decision is for whoever is the medical lead.'\n\nCol Wright said he would have expected the combat medical technician with the group at the time to have known the policy.\n\nBut he added: 'One criticism of this copy (of JSP 539) at the time is it is very long, verbose and not easy to use.\n\n'But all medics are taught the basics of heat injury symptoms.'\n\nThe coroner was told that one of tools used to measure the heat soldiers could be exposed to was a device called a wet bulb globe test (WBGT).\n\nHowever, the inquest was told by Professor George Havenith, a heat stress and heat strain expert from Loughborough University, that the WBGT meter used produced an 'erroneous' low result, as it was in the shade of the base's gym building.\n\nMr Hoole alongside his long-term girlfriend Rachael McKie\n\nHe added: 'I was convinced that any point taken before 10am was definitely an incorrect measurement.'\n\nMr Havenith said as a result the temperature governing whether the AFT should go ahead, had been an under-reading.\n\nAsked on a balance of probabilities whether the march should have gone ahead at all, he added it should not.\n\nOn his estimation of a correct WGBT temperature, the temperature was 'inevitably going to breach the limit'.\n\nHe added another soldier who then collapsed at 8.28am, half an hour before Cpl Hoole, also showed 'a higher level of heat illness' than that of L/Cpl Knight.\n\nAs a result of the heat, Prof Havenith said Cpl Hoole's 'body temperature would have been rising substantially'.\n\nAsked if Cpl Hoole would be alive if the exercise had never been run or been stopped at 8.28am, he replied: 'Yes.\n\n'Because the time between that happening and Cpl Hoole's breakdown at 8.52am is so long, to the high cardio-vascular workload being reached, that therefore I don't think there would have been a trigger (for his collapse).'\n\nThe inquest continues.", "description": "Corporal Joshua Hoole (pictured), of Ecclefechan,
