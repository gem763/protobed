(HomeVisit)\n\nSince 1987, local interior designers have decorated and furnished spaces in some of Howard County, Md.\u2019s grandest estates to raise money for the nonprofit Historic Ellicott City, which supports the preservation and restoration of the Ellicott City Historic District and other historic structures in the county. After two floods, restoration efforts continue to be a priority in Ellicott City.\n\nThis year, the 33rd annual Decorator Show House will take place at Belle Vue at the Chase, a French Provincial-style property that will become home to Jason and Monica Fiegel and their four children when the show ends.\n\n[Howard County executive proposes razing at least 4 buildings to mitigate Ellicott City floods]\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual twist to have designers take on a home that\u2019s already been purchased. Typically, the homes decorated for fundraisers are listed for sale and the owners hope the show house will attract potential buyers. In this case, the Fiegel family liked the idea of adding to their philanthropic efforts to support Historic Ellicott City, and they\u2019re excited to see what their new home will look like when the rooms are revealed.\n\nThe house, at 11645 Vixens Path in Ellicott City, was built in 1921. Local designers from Maryland, Virginia and the District will decorate 23 rooms and spaces in the house for visitors to tour. Many of the accessories used in the rooms will be available for visitors to purchase.\n\nThe 33rd Annual Decorator Show House opens Sept. 21 and runs through Oct. 20. Hours are Wednesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sundays from noon to 5 p.m. Advance tickets are available online at http://historicec.com/show-houses/ for $35 online or at the door.\n\nNo parking is available at the Decorator Show House address. A shuttle will be provided to transport guests to and from the home.
