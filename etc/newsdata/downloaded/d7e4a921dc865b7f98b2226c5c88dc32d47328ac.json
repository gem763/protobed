She\u2019s also studying in London part-time to become a dramatherapist.\n\nShe pays \u00a3395 a month in rent (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHey, Vicky! How much do you pay to live here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRent is \u00a3395 per month plus \u00a315 service fees.\n\nBills \u2013 I think I put about \u00a340 on the gas and electric every month but I still need to change my rate. I\u2019m really disorganised at the moment.\n\nAnd what do you get for what you pay?\n\nOne bedroom, one bathroom, one kitchen, one living room. This place is probably big enough to be a two-bedroom but the fact there is a window in every room was a strong selling point.\n\nHow did you find the place?\n\nA few months ago a friend mentioned on Facebook that he was looking for a new flat and someone commented about Southside Housing Association\u2019s Mid Market Rent scheme. I knew my landlady at the time was planning on selling her flat so I found the scheme online and added myself to the list.\n\nThe mid-market rent homes are for people in full or part-time employment but crucially are secure tenancies and \u2013 this was a life saver for me \u2013 are open for people with pets. I work in the arts and will never be earning a massive amount of money and yet the options are so limited in the private renting market.\n\nI moved in this July and still haven\u2019t fully unpacked \u2013 I\u2019m just coming out of a manic time at work and with starting uni. I\u2019m confident I will get some lampshades and curtains sorted before the end of the year.\n\nThe flat is covered in artsy bits and bobs (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAre you happy where you live?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI live right on Eglinton Cross \u2013 just on the wrong side of the magic invisible line of gentrification which has been creeping up through Govanhill of late. This means I to step over broken glass and chicken bones to get to my overpriced poached egg on sourdough toast.\n\nI love where I live! When I first viewed the place I was very ambivalent. The housing association had just taken over the building and had to give us a disclaimer before they let us in the building \u2013 the front and back doors to the close swung open with the wind, half the stairs were missing and the smell was\u2026 memorable.\n\nBy the time I moved in, however, we had security doors in place, the stairwell was complete and the whole place is pressure cleaned once a week so that it doesn\u2019t smell\u2026 as much.\n\nWhen we went into the flats themselves though (there were three available when I viewed) light just poured out of them. The flats themselves are lovely, big high ceilings and nicely renovated.\n\nI\u2019ve grown very quickly to love the neighbourhood. There\u2019s an African restaurant directly downstairs which has a door into our close and saved me when I locked myself out on my first week (don\u2019t ask). My local nail place Taffy Beauty is two minutes away and I get free entertainment from the Star Bar across the road when they have their karaoke nights. I\u2019m right by Govanhill which has an excellent mix of social enterprises, hipster coffee and plant shops and the best kebab and curry joints in Scotland.\n\nAlong with items brought over from Beijing (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have loads of space. It\u2019s obscene. I study part-time in London and delight in telling my classmates how big my flat is and how little I pay.\n\nHow have you made the flat feel like home?\n\nIt\u2019s still a work in progress. I did the kitchen first. The flat was completely unfurnished when I moved in so I had to scour Gumtree etc to get my appliances, I lucked out with my cooker which I love.\n\nGetting all my spices out on the counters, and my Chinese and Korean bits and bobs out helped. I\u2019ve picked up a lot of wee things along the way and they all remind me of my lovely friends and family who are scattered around the globe.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like living alone?\n\nI have recently come out of a long and lovely co-habiting relationship so it was an adjustment at first but there\u2019s nothing like living alone: freedom, space, independence. If you can afford it, every woman should live alone at least once in her life.\n\nOh hey, Baozi (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe say alone, but you have two pets, right?\n\nWhen the photographer was round my cat, Prince \u2013 also known as Mister Socks \u2013 refused to come out from under the bed. He\u2019s my most recent pal. One rainy day this summer I was walking around my new neighbourhood with the dog and saw a friend on the other side of the road outside an excellent Asian grocer, Strawberry and Spice. \u2018Vicky,\u2019 she said, \u2018Do you want a cat? Because Shaka\u2019s sister is spending too much time in Pakistan and her husband wants to rehome it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLong story short, Prince now lives with us, and after a couple of weeks under the bed has now realised the dog won\u2019t come near him so he kind of rules the roost.\n\nBaozi is my dog. She has an Instagram account. Baozi turned up outside my courtyard house in Beijing in March 2016. She was an adorable wee black and white ball of fluff and has grown into quite a weird-looking thing.\n\nWhen we adopted Baozi we already had a cat, George, so Baozi has grown up being terrorised by cats. George now lives in the lap of luxury with my friend Heather in Beijing, We brought Baozi back to the UK overland on the Transsiberian and then through Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany and Holland by train before hopping on the ferry back to the UK. She is a well-travelled hound and does very well with the Scotrail delays after we got stuck in Poland for two days due to storms.\n\nBaozi has taken to the Southside well and enjoys foraging for discarded chicken and kebabs outside the house on a Sunday morning.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe how hard it was to rent with pets given how ostensibly \u2018pet-friendly\u2019 the UK is but every private listing I saw said \u2018no pets\u2019. When I would go to viewings on the offchance I could convince a landlord I would be one of about 15 people vying for the same overpriced place being showed by some glaikit estate agent flunky and give up hope.\n\nI was not a \u2018desirable\u2019 tenant. I don\u2019t know that I would ever have found a place if Southside Letting hadn\u2019t saved me.\n\nOh hey, Baozi\u2019s pals (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAre there any issues with the flat?\n\nSo far no problems! We\u2019re right on a very busy road which bothered me a bit at first but I don\u2019t hear the traffic any more.\n\nDo you have plans to move again?\n\nNo, I won\u2019t move unless my situation changes dramatically. I\u2019m back on the list with the housing association in case there comes a time I need a bigger place but I genuinely am very happy where I am.\n\nAnd what about buying a place?\n\nNope. I have a secure tenancy, I have no need to feel like I \u2018own\u2019 something. I\u2019ve never been interested in buying a home, my career and lifestyle has always meant I\u2019ve prioritised travel and adventure over saving and putting down roots.\n\nI don\u2019t buy into the idea that we should all aspire to own a house. Homelessness and housing insecurity is a real and fundamental problem in our society today and I think we\u2019ve all got to think about how we\u2019re contributing to it.\n\nA very good point. Let\u2019s have a look around.\n\nWelcome, welcome. Let\u2019s make our way up to the flat (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd here we are (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHere\u2019s the living room (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThat sofa looks cosy and we would like to sit on it (Picture: Michael McGurk/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDoes this smiling mask make you feel unsettled?
