That was my rock bottom.\n\n\"I was angry and emotional. Of course, he had no idea the impact it had on me as he was only three.\n\n\"I remember locking myself in the bathroom and crying. Asking myself how I was going to fix the problem.\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\n\"I told him that it's not funny to call people fat and laugh about it. He could see I was really upset and he felt sad when he saw I was crying.\"\n\nThe mum started going to the gym, improved her diet and went for weight loss surgery after losing 4st.\n\nWhen she fell pregnant in 2004, Schauna used it as an excuse to eat and drink whatever she pleased without paying any regard to her weight.\n\nPregnancy saw Schauna gain 4st and 2lb, taking her weight to 15st 7lb when her eldest son, Mason, now 15, was born.\n\nLife as a new mother didn't help Schauna's weight as she didn't take care of herself.\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\nShe only ate a lot of fried food, processed meals, fast food and pasta.\n\nFrom then on, Schauna continued to gain weight with her following two pregnancies.\n\nShe welcomed her second son, Chase, now 11, in January 2008 and then her youngest, Logan, now 10, in July 2009. By the time she delivered Logan, Schauna's weight was 21st 1lb and she was a UK size 28.\n\nShe said: \"I have memories of being made fun of on the school bus, coming home crying and not wanting to go back.\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\n\"I also remember wearing Spanx under my clothes at school while all my friends were skinny and pretty. I was the ugly, fat friend.\n\n\"I got pregnant at 18 and used that as an excuse to eat and drink whatever I wanted.\n\n\"I gained more than four stone during my first pregnancy. From there I just kept gaining weight with each child.\n\n\"During my first pregnancy I was eating fast food like Taco Bell and Wendy's, I was obsessed with fries and I was regularly drinking Mountain Dew.\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\n\"Mason was born in October 2004 and as a new mum I most definitely didn't take care of myself.\n\n\"I was making quick and easy processed meals. I was very uneducated about nutrition as I'd grown up eating meat and potatoes, with a lot of canned foods.\n\n\"I never ate anything fresh or homemade, so I carried that on as a mother.\n\n\"When I delivered my third son, I was 21st and 1lb, yet he was the smallest baby.\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\n\"It was the hardest pregnancy I had because I was hyper aware that I was already big, and my doctor told me that I shouldn't gain too much weight with him.\n\n\"I developed high blood pressure while I was pregnant and had a few scares. I was also very uncomfortable and had a lot of back and hip pain.\n\n\"I went from 15.5st in my first pregnancy to over 21s at the end of my third. With Logan, I was induced three weeks early because of my blood pressure.\n\n\"I knew people were looking at me, thinking 'woah, she's big', and I'd try to ignore it but couldn't. I didn't leave my house much, if I did, I'd wear jeans and hoodies, even in the summer.\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\n\"It makes me sad that I don't have many pictures with my sons when they were little because I refused to be in them.\"\n\nBut everything changed after Chase called her \"fat\".\n\nSchauna said: \"Almost immediately, I began researching weight loss surgery. I set up a consultation with a bariatric surgeon and we went over the options.\n\n\"I had to do a visit with a personal trainer to learn how working out is important. I also had to prove that I could lose some weight before my surgery, which I did. I was 17st when I went for surgery.\"\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\nShe underwent lap band surgery, which placed a band around the top of her stomach to create a smaller stomach, in March 2013.\n\nSurgery helped Schauna to lose more than five stone initially, but she has also tried numerous diets to encourage her weight loss through nutrition.\n\nShe has tried the low carb diet keto and shake-only diets, and she is now a healthy 11st 2lb and wears UK size 12 clothing.\n\nSince surgery, Schauna eats eggs, chicken and turkey for protein, nuts, protein shakes and vegetables with every meal.\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\nShe said: \"Having the lap band, makes you eat slower, smaller bites, and you pause in between to make sure your bites pass through the band, so ultimately you end up eating less.\n\n\"Within a month I joined the gym and I started doing the bike and the cross-trainer.\n\n\"I remember only being able to do 10 minutes when I first started, but I was proud of myself for being the big girl at the gym and I wasn't ashamed to be in the gym anymore.\n\n\"Over the years I've tried various diets, including shakes, fasting, low carb and keto.\n\n(Image: MDW/Schauna Harshman)\n\n\"I lost most of my weight after surgery and through working out. For a good few years I was stuck around 12st and knew I had to try something else.\n\n\"So, in October 2018 I started a low carb lifestyle mixed with protein shakes.\n\n\"In January 2019 I started the keto lifestyle. I spent some time researching and following accounts and decided to give it a try. That's when I made my @lowcarb.godess Instagram account and started documenting my journey.\n\n\"Through keto I learned that it's about maintaining a lifestyle rather than constantly shedding, so I switched to macro counting, which is what I'm currently doing and I feel amazing.\"\n\nShe added: \"My friends and family are so proud of me and I'm so thankful for their support. It's given me a real drive to keep going and to show people that you can do anything you put your mind to.\n\n\"I'm a mum of three so I'm constantly running around after my sons, I work full time and still manage to track my food, eat homemade meals and work out every day. Anyone who sees that I can do it can know that they can too.\"", "description": "Schauna Harshman, 35, says she hit \"rock bottom\" after her son Chase, then aged three, called her \"fat\" and laughed, leaving her in tears as she locked herself in the bathroom", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Mdw Schauna Harshman"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756242.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Fat-Shamed-by-My-Son.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
