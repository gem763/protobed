And given several teams chose the same furniture as well, it was hard to tell these balconies apart.\n\nThe aforementioned tragedy belonged to Jesse and Mel, who said all along they wouldn\u2019t be busting a boiler to win this week. Real estate agent Jesse\u2019s opinion was the level two and three balconies wouldn\u2019t do much to sell the houses, so they decided to keep their powder and their cash for the final three rooms.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be taking your family through your bedroom to have a shindig on the balcony,\u201d Jesse pointed out.\n\nBut Shaynna Blaze didn\u2019t care, and a small fake succulent on a coffee table really ground her gears.\n\n\u201cCome on, please \u2026 I\u2019m taking off extra points for taking the piss with a fake plant,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lazy,\u201d Neale Whittaker agreed. \u201cIt feels really lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meh,\u201d Darren Palmer added before Shaynna threw one final bunch \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s boring as bat shit\u201d.\n\nCharming.\n\nThe pair cop two fives in the final judgment but Jesse claims \u201cIt\u2019s water off a duck\u2019s back\u201d.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Mark and Mitch take out the win, meaning they\u2019ve won all the rooms on the third level.\n\nThey put a 12-seater dining table on their level 3 balcony, and decorated their second floor balcony with cane furniture and day bed. Their efforts get them three perfect 10s, the first of the season.\n\nThe only losers from the situation are their neighbours.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to hear what\u2019s going on on this veranda in house number two, and three, and four, and five,\u201d Darren Palmer says. Cue pained smiles from their neighbours.\n\nNext door, Tess and Luke are praised for their styling and furniture choice, particularly given the fact they\u2019re flat broke. They\u2019ve placed a high, narrow dining table right up against the balustrade, for eating breakfast while enjoying the views over St Kilda.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the pizzazz of next door, but it\u2019s a very nice veranda,\u201d Neale says.\n\nAndy and Deb have gone against their usual beachy feel to match the industrial colours of their verandas, and it doesn\u2019t pay off, with the judges saying that has created a disconnect with the rest of their house.\n\nAndy, showing once again he\u2019s the sweetest husband on The Block, will brook no criticism of his wife\u2019s styling.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Deb says.\n\n\u201cIt was for me,\u201d Andy says. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise have presented two fairly bare spaces, and only get kudos for putting a game of Jenga in one of their verandas. An uncomfortable wooden bench divides the judges, with Darren Palmer the only fan.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even sit on this in a park,\u201d Neale says.\n\nShaynna thinks the spaces are cold and formal.\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise had been considering using their bonus point this week, but the judges\u2019 comments sink that idea. Their last room win was way back in week two, and with only three rooms to go, they\u2019re on track to being one of The Block\u2019s losingest couples.\n\nFinal scores:\n\nMitch and Mark 30\n\nTess and Luke 23.5\n\nAndy and Deb 20.5\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise 20.5\n\nJesse and Mel 16.5", "description": "It was hard to tell the teams\u2019 verandas apart, but that didn\u2019t stop the judges slamming one \u201clazy\u201d effort.", "authors": ["Claire Sutherland"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20204537/capi_2055920efb3b3d94321930195b7ad5f5_7920e61e64af61d7cda04ab84eccb6bf.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
