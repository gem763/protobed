Here\u2019s how I described the methodology in 2018.\n\n\u2026the bureaucrats\u2026have put together a measure of income distribution and decided that \u201crelative poverty\u201d exists for anyone who has less than 50 percent of the median level of disposable income.\n\nMore recently, I explained why this approach is senseless, at least if one wants to measure actual poverty\n\n\u2026an artificial and misleading definition of poverty. One that depends on the distribution of income rather than any specific measure of poverty. Which is insanely dishonest. It means that everyone\u2019s income could double and the supposed rate of poverty would stay the same. Or a country could execute all the rich people and the alleged rate of poverty would decline.\n\nNow we have a new member of this ill-begotten group of hucksters.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from an article in the latest issue of the Economist.\n\n\u2026international comparisons\u2026make\u2026America a true outlier. When assessed on poverty relative to other countries (the share of families making less than 50% of the national median income after taxes and transfers), America is among the worst-performing in the OECD club of mostly rich countries (see chart). Despite its higher level of income, that is not because it starts with a very large share of poor people before supports kick in\u2014it is just that the safety net does not do as much work as elsewhere. On this relative-poverty scale, more than a fifth of American children remain poor after government benefits, compared with 3.6% of Finnish children.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the accompanying chart.\n\nNeedless to say, any chart that purports to show less poverty in Mexico than the United States is laughably inaccurate.\n\nBut that\u2019s the kind of perverse outcome that is generated when using a ridiculously dishonest approach.\n\nI suppose the Economist deserves a bit of credit. In both the article and in the chart, they acknowledge (at least for careful readers) that they\u2019re measuring the share of the population with less than 50 percent of a society\u2019s median income, not the share of people living in poverty.\n\nSo why, then, do they refer to the \u201cpoverty rate\u201d?\n\nI have no idea if the reporter is dishonest or incompetent, but I can say with certainty that the Economist has done a disservice to readers.\n\nP.S. The Economist relied on dodgy data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And if you read the columns about the other Poverty Hucksters, you\u2019ll find that most of them also relied on numbers from that left-leaning, Paris-based bureaucracy.
