REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/Illustration/File Photo\n\n\u201cWe have 7.5 billion people and the population continues to grow, so there is a need to eat more vegetables, cereals, and less sugar, meat products,\u201d said Laurent Freixe, Executive Vice President and head of operations in the Americas.\n\nLimited natural resources on the planet and the growing public health problem of obesity are behind the changes Freixe sees as necessary. He also cited growing public awareness of the food production process as well as issues such as child labor and deforestation, which is especially pertinent in Brazil.\n\nMeat production, particularly beef, is a significant contributor to carbon emissions that scientists blame for global warming.\n\n\u201cWe work constantly in the reformulation of our products,\u201d the executive told reporters ahead of an event in Sao Paulo with university students from the four countries in the Mercosur trade bloc: Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. It is part of a career training program sponsored by the company.\n\nFreixe also said public awareness is growing around the world regarding raw materials used to produce food. This poses a challenge for every large food processor.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more sensitivity on the matter everywhere, not only in Europe or the U.S. We are in a connected world, people have access to information, consumers want to know where raw materials come from, if they were produced ethically,\u201d he said.\n\nNestl\u00e9 is a major buyer worldwide of coffee, sugar, cocoa and milk, among other commodities. It is a significant buyer of Brazilian coffee and sugar.\n\nThe company says it clearly states to suppliers that it does not buy raw materials that were produced in recently deforested areas or where child labor has been reported.\n\n\u201cThe question mark is how to make that happen? Because there are millions of farmers in so many countries,\u201d the executive said. \u201cWhen there is an indication of a problem, we investigate. If confirmed, we cut the supplier,\u201d he added.\n\nForest fires and deforestation in the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest rainforest, jumped sharply this year, causing a wave of worldwide criticism regarding how the local government is managing the situation.\n\nGlobal food companies were also pressed by consumers and activists to avoid sourcing commodities from places where forests were recently cleared.", "description": "Nestl\u00e9 SA , one of the world's largest food processors, believes population growth will require human diets to adapt, reducing consumption of sugar, salt and meat products, an executive said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Marcelo Teixeira", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444249691&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1YP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
