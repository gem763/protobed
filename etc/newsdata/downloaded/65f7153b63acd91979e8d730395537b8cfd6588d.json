Instant messaging app Kik is a service similar to Whatsapp. It is popular with children primarily for features that allow you to join groups, send emojis, make memes, play games and listen to music. However, it is possible to find and chat with total strangers, and you can even search for public groups aimed at teenagers wanting to chat. The app has more than 15 million monthly users and doesn\u2019t require a telephone number or your real name to sign up. The app has attracted a barrage of criticism and has been linked to sex offences against children up and down the country. Security experts have warned parents to monitor their children\u2019s use of Kik, due to its added levels of anonymity.\n\nThe SEC now argues Kin is a security \u2013 such as a bond or a stock \u2013 rather than a form of currency and that Kik had acted as if it was issuing shares in the company.\n\nThe department's complaint revolved around Kin recently trading at less than half of what people bought it for.\n\nAt the time of writing, at 16.12 on September 24, 2019, one Kin was worth $0.000009 (\u00a30.0000072) and had fallen almost 32 per cent in a day.\n\nThe SEC said in a statement earlier this year: 'Kik marketed the Kin tokens as an investment opportunity.\n\n'Kik allegedly told investors that rising demand would drive up the value of Kin, and that Kik would undertake crucial work to spur that demand.'\n\nIt said people buying the tokens were not given enough information about them to make an informed decision on whether to buy them.\n\nIn a blog post in which he announced Kik's closure, Mr Livingston wrote: 'After 18 months of working with the SEC the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court.\n\n'Becoming a security would kill the usability of any cryptocurrency and set a dangerous precedent for the industry.\n\n'So with the SEC working to characterize almost all cryptocurrencies as securities we made the decision to step forward and fight.\n\n'While we are ready to take on the SEC in court, we underestimated the tactics they would employ.\n\n'How they would take our quotes out of context to manipulate the public to view us as bad actors. How they would pressure exchanges not to list Kin. And how they would draw out a long and expensive process to drain our resources.'\n\nIn that post Mr Livingston said the Kik app would be shut down and the business would be reduced to 19 'elite employees' from more than 100 people.\n\nThis is intended to cut the company's outgoings by 85 per cent and make sure it can afford to survive its pending lawsuit.\n\nThe company's name has been tarnished in recent years by allegations that child porn is shared on its messaging app.\n\nDespite the app's links to child sex abuse cases, the UK's NSPCC children's charity last year ranked Kik among the safest social media sites/apps for children to use, with youngsters less likely to be exposed to content about suicide, violence, bullying or drink or drugs than other sites such as Reddit, YouTube or Facebook\n\nA BBC investigation last year found that Kik, which is particularly popular among teenagers, had been featured in more than 1,100 child sexual abuse cases in five years.\n\nFreedom of Information responses from 29 police forces in the UK revealed that 28 of them had dealt with sexual abuse cases involving the app.\n\nAmong them they had 1,147 investigations into child sexual exploitation, grooming or 'image offences', presumed to be the sharing of illegal porn.", "description": "The Kik Messenger app, headquartered in Ontario, Canada, will close down so its founders can afford to take on the US Government in court over a complaint about its cryptocurrency.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/16/18875446-0-Kik_Messenger_was_launched_in_2009_but_is_being_taken_offline_by-a-5_1569337332826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
