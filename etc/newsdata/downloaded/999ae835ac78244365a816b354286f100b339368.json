It wrote:\n\n\u201cWe were surprised and disappointed that the SEC chose to file the lawsuit under these circumstances, and we disagree with the SEC's legal position.\u201d\n\nCourt hearing is scheduled for Oct. 24\n\nIn the letter, Telegram stated that they are continuing to assess the best ways to resolve the situation in the interests of relevant parties, including but not limited to evaluating whether to delay the launch date.\n\nAfter deeming Telegram\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) illegal, the SEC also filed a temporary restraining order, setting a court hearing in New York for Oct. 24.\n\nFollowing the news, New York Times tech reporter Nathaniel Popper tweeted on Oct. 12 to point out the involvement of high-profile investors in Telegram\u2019s $1.7 billion ICO, including Benchmark, Sequoia and Lightspeed. He wrote:\n\n\u201cThe SEC's move to shut down Telegram's crypto project raises questions about the big venture capital firms that gave it $1.7 billion and convinced themselves that it would pass regulatory muster. That includes Benchmark, Sequoia and Lightspeed.\u201d\n\nYesterday, a private Telegram channel for TON investors removed all previous posts and announced it will be taking a break amid the increased level of regulatory uncertainty.\n\nCriticism against SEC over no clarity for crypto\n\nThe SEC has been notably criticized for its lack of clarity regarding cryptocurrencies and ICOs. In late September, a group of lawmakers from the U.S. Congress sent a letter to the authority\u2019s chairman Jay Clayton, urging the commission to issue clear guidance on cryptocurrencies. Previously, Representative Warren Davidson hosted a crypto roundtable where participants expressed their concerns over the existing legal framework for ICOs and crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, John Berlau, a senior member at libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute, criticized the SEC\u2019s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, arguing that its \u201cburdensome regulation\u201d kills transformative innovation. He also argued that the SEC\u2019s scrutiny could threaten the functionality of blockchain tech if the agency treats cryptocurrencies as securities. In early April, U.S. lawmakers reintroduced the Token Taxonomy Act that aims to exclude crypto from securities laws.", "description": "Telegram does not agree with the SEC\u2019s recent action and claims it has been trying to solicit feedback from the agency for the past 18 months", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOGIxMDAzMjhlOGYyNmE3NjBlNmJmZWRkYjFjY2Y4OWIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
