I cannot stop crying.'\n\nJurors heard that the female defendant is expected to say she thought the boy was just going to end the relationship with his ex, and that's what she wanted him to record.\n\nProsecutors said that the boy spent about three-and-a-half hours inside his ex-girlfriend's house during the alleged incident.\n\nThey say that the female defendant was near the house for more than two hours, and that she sent more than 50 text messages to him while he was in the property.\n\nOne of the texts from her read: 'Hurry up, what's taking so long?'\n\nWhile he was in the house, jurors have heard that he began engaging in 'bizarre conduct'.\n\nThis included 'asking her whether she would kill herself for him, asking her whether he could kill her, asking her how he should kill her, telling her that he had been told to kill her, insisting that he had to kill her and then suggesting that he was joking, and instructing her to apply makeup to her neck to give the appearance of strangulation, so that he could take a photograph and send it to another as fake evidence of her death'.\n\nThe girl had begun putting makeup on her neck to make it look like she had been strangled, the court heard.\n\nShe closed her eyes while he took a picture of her, but when she opened her eyes she saw him with a 'massive' knife.\n\nAfter he left the house, he then began to repeatedly stab her in a garden at the side of the house.\n\nJurors have heard that the boy has pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to intent, and unlawful possession of a knife in a public place.\n\nHe denies intending to kill the girl, and accepts having sex with her but says it was consensual.\n\nThe female defendant denies both offences with which she has been charged.\n\nThe trial, which is expected to run for two weeks, continues.", "description": "The boy, 17, from Greater Manchester, had been seeing his ex, 16, behind the back of his new girlfriend, 17.
