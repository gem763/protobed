With a looming general election and the possibility of him becoming Prime Minister, I feel I have to take a stand. I cannot advocate a government led by Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nWho is Dame Louise Ellman? MP who dramatically quit Labour Party after 55 years The 73-year-old MP, who serves Liverpool Riverside, was born in Manchester to a Jewish family before going on to study at university in Hull and in York. She was elected to serve on Lancashire County Council in 1970 before becoming the Labour group leader in 1977. At the 1997 general election, she was elected to Parliament to serve the Liverpool Riverside constituency. Since 2008, she has been Chair of the Transport Select Committee. She is the Chair of the All-Party Britain-Israel Parliamentary Group and of Labour Friends of Israel and is Honorary President of the Jewish Labour Movement. Ms Ellman became a dame in 2018 for parliamentary and political services. She also serves as Vice President of the Jewish Leadership Council. On October 16, 2019 she resigned from the Labour party citing concerns over anti-semitism and claiming that Jeremy Corbyn was not fit to lead.\n\n'Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, antisemitism has become mainstream in the Labour Party. Jewish members have been bullied, abused and driven out.\n\n'Antisemites have felt comfortable and vile conspiracy theories have been propagated. A party that permits anti-Jewish racism to flourish cannot be called anti-racist.\n\n'This is not compatible with the Labour Party's values of equality, tolerance and respect for minorities.\n\n'Shamefully, its anti-Jewish racism is now being investigated by one of the last labour government's proudest creations, the Equality and Human Rights Commission.'\n\nShe claimed that Mr Corbyn had spent three decades 'consorting with, and never confronting, antisemites, Holocaust deniers and terrorists.'\n\n'The Labour Party is no longer a safe place for Jews and Jeremy Corbyn must bear the responsibility for this. We cannot allow him to do to the country what he has done to the Labour Party,' she continued.\n\n'The overwhelming majority of the Jewish community is fearful of what a Corbyn government might mean for Britain's Jews. I share those concerns. But this issue is not simply about the Jewish community.\n\n'This is about the nature of our society. Jeremy Corbyn's seeming tolerance of antisemitism would embolden racists, poison our public debate and damage the social cohesion of our country.'\n\nWith 55 years under her belt in the Labour Party, Ms Ellman has seen a great deal of change within the party - including within its leadership and ranks.\n\nBut some of the change she has seen has not been for the better, she claimed.\n\nLabour MP Louise Ellman (pictured last year) has announced she is leaving the party because she 'can no longer advocate voting Labour when it risks Corbyn becoming PM'\n\nLouise Ellman speaks at the Jewish Labour Movement Rally at Middle Street Synagogue, Brighton during the Labour Party Conference in September\n\n'My values - traditional Labour values - have remained the same,' she said. 'It is Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, that has changed. He has presided over a culture of hatred, fear and intolerance in the Labour Party.\n\n'But this issue is no longer just about the Labour Party - it is about the threat a Jeremy Corbyn premiership could pose to the country.'\n\nDame Louise said she would not join another political party and hoped to return to Labour under a different leadership.\n\nPosting her letter online, she tweeted: 'I have made the truly agonising decision to leave the Labour Party after 55 years.\n\n'I can no longer advocate voting Labour when it risks Corbyn becoming PM.\n\n'I will continue to serve the people of Liverpool Riverside as I have had the honour to do since 1997.'\n\nHarriet Harman described the resignation of Louise Ellman as 'very sad news'.\n\n'Thank you, Louise, for your terrific contribution to Parliament, politics and the Labour Party!' she tweeted.\n\nLiberal Democrat former leader Tim Farron tweeted: 'I've known Louise for 30 years.\n\n'If there's no place for Louise Ellman in the 2019 Labour Party, they are finished as a serious force.'\n\nThe news comes after in May, Labour faced one of the most shameful days in its history after a formal inquiry was launched into whether it has victimised Jews.\n\nIn a potentially explosive intervention, the equalities watchdog said it 'suspects' the party has committed 'unlawful acts' in its handling of the anti-Semitism crisis.\n\nOnly once before has the Equality and Human Rights Commission launched a formal inquiry into a political party \u2013 and that was the far-Right BNP.\n\nThe EHRC will investigate whether Mr Corbyn's party has 'unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish' \u2013 and whether senior staff responded properly to anti-Semitism allegations against its members.\n\nIf Labour fails to accept its findings, it could be taken to court and be fined.\n\nLabour rejected claims it was institutionally racist.", "description": "The 73-year-old, who serves\u00a0Liverpool Riverside, said it had been a 'truly agonising' decision to make but that she had to in order to 'take a stand' against the Labour leader's leadership.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/22/19808408-0-image-a-44_1571261073202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
