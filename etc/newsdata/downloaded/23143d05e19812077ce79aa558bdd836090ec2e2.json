The Spaniard has given youth a chance this term, with Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock, Bukayo Sako and Ainsley Maitland-Niles all legitimate options to start at Sheffield United on Monday.\n\nNketiah has found first team action difficult to come by, even though he has dropped down a division to spend time on loan at Leeds United.\n\nLeeds manager Marcelo Bielsa has not picked the 20-year-old striker, who scored a hat-trick for England's Under-21 side during the international break, to start a single Championship match so far.\n\nEmery made it clear he did not intend to contact Bielsa to find out why. \"Now is not the moment,\" he said. \"First I respect his coach and his decision. And I think he is going to play more, because he is going to deserve it.\"\n\nEmery declared he was looking forward to pitting his wits against Chris Wilder, the current League Managers Association manager of the year.\n\nWilder has led Sheffield United to two promotions in three seasons and Emery viewed him as the latest addition to a growing band of home-grown coaches who are excelling in the top flight.", "description": "Unai Emery is not worried that Eddie Nketiah will miss out on Arsenal's youthful revolution.", "authors": ["Jon West"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213154412-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLf6XVudQ0d-fF3pHUPFzECPyir9oEwubCgQMa-ICRB8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
