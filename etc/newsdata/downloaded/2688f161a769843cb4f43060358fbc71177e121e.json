The swollen Detroit River had spilled into the low-lying Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood \u2013 an event not seen near this scale since 1986.\n\nVolunteers sandbagged the area as the city\u2019s overwhelmed sewer system spilled raw sewage into the river, which connects Lake Huron and Lake Erie. Across the channel from Jefferson Chalmers, water damaged the historic boathouse on Belle Isle, a 982-acre island park that remains partly shut down because of flooding.\n\nRelated: This US heartland has been flooded for five months. Does anyone care?\n\nMeanwhile, in Duluth, Minnesota, the city is rebuilding after a powerful storm over Lake Superior damaged a popular pedestrian path, eroded acres of lakefront property and ravaged infrastructure along the shore.\n\nAbout 800 miles to the east, floods hit Buffalo, New York, on Lake Erie in two of the last three years, while Lake Michigan\u2019s historically high waters inundated parts of Chicago throughout the spring and summer months.\n\nThe havoc wreaked on communities bordering the Great Lakes is a result of their water level steadily rising over the last five years and spiking to record levels this spring and summer. In 2019, the lakes\u2019 depths ranged from 14in to nearly 3ft above long-term averages, according to data from the US army corps of engineers. In June, water in the Lakes St Clair, Ontario, Superior and Erie set records for monthly mean levels, while Lake Michigan-Huron rose to 1in from its recorded peak.\n\nThat is leading to widespread damage in coastal cities, eroded shorelines and beaches and many other issues. The record levels come just five years after the lakes experienced historically low levels in 2014, and climate scientists say it is clear what\u2019s fueling the drastic swing: the Earth\u2019s rising temperatures.\n\n\u201cBigger picture, it\u2019s climate change,\u201d said Richard B Rood, a professor in the University of Michigan\u2019s department of climate and space sciences and engineering. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that we are in a region where climate change is having an impact.\u201d\n\nRood said the Great Lakes basin, which holds 90% of the nation\u2019s freshwater, can expect similar shifts in the coming decades as world temperatures increase.\n\nClimate scientists say a confluence of climate crisis-related issues resulted in this year\u2019s levels. Warmer air over the Gulf of Mexico caused more evaporation, and that moisture pushed into the region during the spring and summer. Higher temperatures give the atmosphere more capacity to hold evaporated water, Rood said, which is why storms are dumping more rain than 50 years ago.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in wet periods, you start to get persistent, basin-wide extreme precipitation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe numbers back that up. By May, Cleveland, Ohio on Lake Erie\u2019s shore saw more rainy days than any year since 1953. Muskegon, on Lake Michigan\u2019s shore, experienced 7.45in more rainfall than average throughout the first eight months, while Sault Ste Marie on Lake Superior tallied about 9in more than average for the same period. Buffalo saw 34% more rain than typical.\n\nThe moisture rained down on ground and lakes already more saturated than usual because a January polar vortex brought frigid temperatures that prevented wintertime evaporation crucial to keeping water levels in check. Meanwhile, a heavy snow pack melted. pushing up levels even further.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing all these things that have an effect on the water cycle converge, which is why we\u2019re having these enormous water volumes,\u201d Rood said.\n\nThough the region finally dried out a bit in August and water levels are slightly receding, the Great Lakes\u2019 fall storm season is fast approaching. Fall is a time of high winds and the agency\u2019s six-month forecast predicts levels will remain very high, thus there\u2019s a strong likelihood for even more damage this year.\n\nCoastal communities need to give the storms and fluctuating lake levels stronger consideration when building near the shoreline, said Richard Norton, an urban and regional planning professor at the University of Michigan. There\u2019s still an inclination to build as close to the water as possible, which was especially a problem as levels began dropping in the early 2000s.", "description": "Depths of lakes that hold about 90% of US\u2019s freshwater spiking to record levels, from 14in to nearly 3ft above long-term averages  \u2018There\u2019s no doubt that we are in a region where climate change is having an impact,\u2019 said Richard B Rood, a University of Michigan professor.
