This removes any potentially \u201cnegative nuances\u201d from the Latin word \u201csecretum\u201d, which the pope said in a decree was closer to \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201creserved\u201d than \u201csecret\u201d when the archives were first named in about 1610.\n\nThey have not been secret in practice for a long time anyway: like most state archives, they are open to qualified researchers after a period of time. The collection of papers, documents and parchments dates as far back as the eighth century, making the archives one of the world\u2019s most important research centres.\n\nThey contain 53 miles (85km) of shelving and an underground vault known as \u201cthe Bunker\u201d, a version of which was recreated in the film version of the Dan Brown novel Angels and Demons.\n\nVatican to unseal archives on controversial WWII pope Read more\n\nThe archives are open for the period of the pontificate of Pope Pius XI, ending in 1939. Those from the pontificate of Pius XII (1939-58) are due to be opened to scholars next March, an event which has been keenly awaited by the Jewish community; many Jews and historians say Pius did not do enough to help those facing persecution by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Vatican maintains that Pius chose to work behind the scenes, concerned that public intervention would have worsened the situation for both Jews and Catholics in a wartime Europe dominated by Hitler.\n\nWhen Francis announced the date of the opening last March, he said Pius\u2019s legacy had been treated with \u201csome prejudice and exaggeration\u201d.", "description": "Pope says new name for trove of priceless papers will be the Vatican Apostolic Archives", "authors": ["Reuters In Vatican City"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53e36c1af62c7a721f09ac9babfdbb73a8b3e534/0_269_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a9e9217fc72d283352d52545195c271", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
