He was smiling and happy. It could\u2019ve been worse!\u201d she said.\n\nKube said Ryan and his twin brother, Jackson, were with her at NBC\u2019s Washington bureau in the early morning before it was time for preschool. She said her husband was out of town at the time.\n\n\u201cHe called me and apologized,\u201d Kube said of her husband. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 but sort of laughing and saying, \u2018Is everyone mad? Are you OK?\u201d\u2019", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 Sometimes unexpected breaking news happens while you're reporting breaking news. #MSNBCMoms #workingmoms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
