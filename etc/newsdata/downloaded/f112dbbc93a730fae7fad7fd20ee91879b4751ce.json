It\u2019s the Crown\u2019s case that he had put MDMA in her drink. She is very clear she did not take it knowingly.\n\n\u2018Although the defendant has admitted giving her a small amount of MDMA, he says it was at her request.\n\nThe rapist was warned he faces a \u2018significant prison term\u2019 when sentenced at Warwick Crown Court (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018The next thing she recalls is waking late the following morning, naked apart from her bra, and Callaghan lying next to her, naked.\n\n\u2018She was aware she had injuries all over her body, and she asked if he had punched her in the face.\n\n\u2018He said no, and that she was possessed and that there was a demon in her house.\n\n\u2018She says Callaghan appeared to be trying to blame her injuries on the supernatural.\n\n\u2018The inescapable fact is that somehow she got very real injuries all over her body. This was nothing to do with ghosts.\n\n\u2018She has no recollection of having sex with him whatsoever. If she was incapable, any sex he had with her was rape.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the trial, Detective Inspector Cindy Stephenson, of Warwickshire Police, said: \u2018This was a horrific crime that has had a profound impact on the victim.\n\n\u2018While I am sure she will never fully get over what Callaghan did, I hope she can take some comfort from this verdict and start to move on with her life.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
