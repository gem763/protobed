Zelenskiy agreed to Trump\u2019s requests. The aid was later provided.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman said in his prepared opening statement to the three House committees conducting the inquiry. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security,\u201d Vindman added.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with Ukraine and has called the impeachment probe politically motivated.\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony was some of the most damaging to date for Trump, who faces the possibility of impeachment as he prepares to run for re-election. Biden is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination to face him.\n\nFederal law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nVindman, appearing after receiving a subpoena from lawmakers despite the Trump administration policy of not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry, recounted listening in on the call in the White House Situation Room with colleagues from the National Security Council and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office.\n\nAfter the call, Vindman said he reported his concerns to the National Security Council\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nVindman said earlier in July he had also reported concerns about previous pressure by the administration on Ukraine to carry out politically motivated investigations to the lawyer.\n\nA PIVOTAL MEETING\n\nVindman also called into question the truthfulness of earlier testimony by another administration official, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nAt a July 10 meeting in Washington with visiting Ukrainian officials, Vindman said Sondland, a former Trump political donor, told the Ukrainian officials they needed to \u201cdeliver specific investigations in order to secure a meeting with the president.\u201d At that point, Vindman said, then-national security adviser John Bolton cut the meeting short.\n\nAccording to Vindman\u2019s opening statement, Sondland told other U.S. officials in a debriefing after the meeting that it was important that the Ukrainian investigations center on the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma.\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security,\u201d Vindman said.\n\nSondland gave a different account of the July 10 events in his own testimony in the inquiry, saying that \u201cif Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill or others harbored any misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks to reporters following a policy luncheon in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nBefore his testimony, some Trump allies, including Fox News host Laura Ingraham, sought to attack Vindman\u2019s integrity and questioned his loyalty to the United States.\n\nBiden, however, described Vindman as a hero, calling attacks on the Army officer\u2019s character and loyalty \u201cdespicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a patriot,\u201d Biden told MSNBC.\n\nREPUBLICANS CALL INQUIRY \u2018A SHAM\u2019\n\nSeeking to blunt Republican criticism that the inquiry is secretive and does not give Trump due process, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi laid out legislation that could be voted on this week and that sets up a two-stage process for the inquiry.\n\nIn the first, the House Intelligence Committee would continue its probe, including via public hearings, and would have the right to issue public transcripts of depositions it has already taken in private.\n\nThe intelligence panel would then send a public report on its findings to the House Judiciary Committee, which would conduct its own proceedings and report on \u201csuch resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Trump would be allowed to participate in proceedings in the Judiciary Committee, which eventually could vote on formal charges against the Republican president. House passage of articles of impeachment would trigger a trial in the Republican-led Senate on whether to remove Trump from office.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday morning before the measure was unveiled, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that the entire impeachment process remained a \u201csham.\u201d\n\nReferring to the closed meetings and depositions held by the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs panels over the past few weeks, McCarthy said: \u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle. Due process starts at the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are in a legal term, it\u2019d be the fruit from the poisonous tree, it\u2019d be a mistrial. None of this information would go forward,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nThe White House adopted a similar stance.\n\nSlideshow (27 Images)\n\n\u201cThe resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote,\u201d White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said.\n\n\u201cThis resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration,\u201d she added.\n\nCongress\u2019 impeachment process is much different from a judicial process, however, and is not governed by the same rules at the various stages of investigations.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives the House broad authority to set the ground rules for an impeachment inquiry and Democrats say they are following House rules on investigations.", "description": "A White House official testified on Tuesday he was so alarmed by hearing U.S. President Donald Trump ask Ukraine's president to investigate a political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, that he reported the matter to a White House lawyer.", "authors": ["Karen Freifeld", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446329567&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1TZ", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
