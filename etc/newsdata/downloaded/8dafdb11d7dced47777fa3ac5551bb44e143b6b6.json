They stifled us in the second half and we only have ourselves to blame.\u201d\n\nHungary failed to capitalise on Croatia\u2019s slip-up as they conceded two goals against the run of play in front of a fervent home crowd in Budapest.\n\nRobert Mak fired the visitors ahead in the 40th minute when he swept a loose ball into the net from seven metres after Marek Hamsik\u2019s teasing low cross from the right rebounded kindly.\n\nThe home side levelled in the 50th minute when 18-year-old Dominik Szoboszlai curled in a delightful free kick past keeper Martin Dubravka for his first international goal.\n\nBut the Hungarians were rocked again six minutes later when Slovakia\u2019s 19-year-old striker Robert Bozenik also netted the first goal for his country, driving in a crisp shot from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nMak fired over an empty net after a defensive mix-up several minutes later and Dubravka then rescued Slovakia when he kept out a rasping shot by midfielder Balazs Dzsudzsak.", "description": "Croatia went top of Euro 2020 qualifying Group E despite being held to a surprise 1-1 draw in Azerbaijan as Hungary slipped to a shock 2-1 home defeat by neighbours Slovakia on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428094969&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881VM", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
