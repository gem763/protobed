And this is, I think, even a step up from that because it\u2019s in Europe this time. I think the fans are a little bit crazier, a little bit better, a little bit more into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a whole other level of things. I mean, the crowd for one, but the lights, the DJ, the walkout, it makes it seem like an event. Not just something that you get to watch, but you feel like you\u2019re a part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe energy on deck, I can still feel it right now as I\u2019m sitting here,\u201d said DC Trident captain Cody Miller in a post-match media scrum. \u201cIt was awesome, it was a lot of fun, and I think that there\u2019s just more greatness to come. It was so, so fun.\u201d\n\nAnother thing that stood out to Miller was the noise, which was exaggerated due to the way the building was constructed.\n\n\u201cI think probably cause the pool is mostly made of concrete\u2026the noise! I have not been to many facilities where the noise is that awesome, it makes it fun. It makes it fun for us, it makes it fun for people that are watching,\u201d said Miller enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cI think that makes a big difference with the energy levels,\u201d said Energy Standard male captain Chad Le Clos on how the crowd impacted the match. \u201cDoing back-to-back races \u2013 50 fly, 200 fly, 100 freestyle \u2013 getting back up (on the blocks) was very special, and a big thank you to the crowd. Altogether it was a great show.\u201d\n\nDC Trident coach Cyndi Gallagher had a similar perspective as the athletes, really enjoying the vibe that the match produced.\n\n\u201cI think this is super fun, exciting,\u201d Gallagher said in an interview during one of the breaks. \u201cI love the crowd, I love that they\u2019re getting the crowd into it, the music, the DJ, our energy is great. We are all in.\u201d\n\nSarah Sjostrom, a Swede who is one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars in Europe, always loves swimming in front of an Italian crowd.\n\n\u201cThey love the Italian swimmers, but they do love the other swimmers as well,\u201d said the 2016 Olympic gold medalist. \u201cThe other swimming stars, even if you\u2019re from Sweden. I always love racing in Italy. So it\u2019s a lot of fun to have very good supporters here in the stands.\u201d\n\nThe match was tightly contested for first place between Energy Standard, who won last weekend in Indianapolis, and the Cali Condors, who received a significant boost with Dressel making his debut.\n\nDressel went out and won the final event, the men\u2019s skins, which are worth triple the points. However, his Energy Standard counterparts Florent Manaudou and Ben Proud placed second and third to secure another win for their club.\n\n\u201cIt hurts. I mean, I\u2019d much rather have a team title than MVP, 100 percent of the time,\u201d said Dressel, who won a total of four individual events over the two days. \u201cIt definitely stings, but it\u2019s cool, there\u2019s already started (to be) rivalries (developing) and stuff. Of course, friendly rivalries. I respect everyone on that team, but I would\u2019ve liked to win the meet. And it was so close which is what makes it hurt a little bit more.\u201d\n\nThe 23-year-old is confident the Condors will continue to improve and have a good chance of winning it all at the league grand final in Vegas in December.\n\n\u201cI could\u2019ve been better throughout the meet and scored more points, we all could\u2019ve been, everyone across the board. We\u2019re on a good progression for now, from Indy to here, so we\u2019ll find some more room to be better, and then hopefully by Vegas we\u2019ll have it figured out.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s Trident club was locked in a close race with the hometown Aqua Centurions, going back and forth throughout the match in the race for third.\n\n\u201cWe have two teams, my team (DC Trident) and the Aqua Centurions, vying for just a few points here and there. It feels like it\u2019s an NBA game. It feels like a basketball game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were a ways behind the two front-running teams, but were still in a tight race with another team, so, it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rivalry. It\u2019s a good rivalry, It\u2019s been fun.\u201d\n\nAbout the ISL: The International Swimming League is a global professional swimming competition launching in 2019 with teams in both Europe (Italy-based Aqua Centurions, France-based Energy Standard, Hungary-based Iron, and London Roar) and the United States (Cali Condors, DC Trident, LA Current, NY Breakers).
