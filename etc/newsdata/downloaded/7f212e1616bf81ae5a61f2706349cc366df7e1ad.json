Drew Brees has been great for a lot longer.\n\nIn a fantastic Monday night game, Watson and Brees traded enormous drives in the final minute. Watson threw a 37-yard touchdown to Kenny Stills with 37 seconds left, and it seemed that would lift the Texans to a dramatic win.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nBut Brees has been in this spot before. He got the Saints in field-goal range and as time expired, Wil Lutz won it with a 58-yard kick to give the Saints a great 30-28 victory.\n\nIt was the latest chapter in Brees\u2019 legendary career, and a heck of a kick by Lutz.\n\nDrew Brees celebrates a touchdown pass with Taysom Hill.

He spent time in the medical tent but never missed a play. He later hit DeAndre Hopkins for a pair of touchdowns. Houston led 21-10 midway through the third quarter.\n\nThe pylon cam look at Deshaun's dive is nuts pic.twitter.com/ecDFMnQ2By \u2014 The Checkdown (@thecheckdown) September 9, 2019\n\nEventually the Saints took back control of the game. The pass rush was all over Watson. When he was sacked twice in the final five minutes and Houston had to punt, the game looked all but done. A field goal by the Saints gave them a 27-21 lead with less than a minute to go.\n\nWatson completed two enormous passes to give the Texans the lead. Watson started the drive with a great 38-yard toss to Hopkins. He hit Stills for a score and it looked like Houston had a crazy win.\n\nBut Brees had time.\n\nSaints win it on final play\n\nStory continues\n\nHouston\u2019s strategy will be picked apart, especially on Brees\u2019 final pass. Brees hit Ted Ginn for 15 yards and Michael Thomas for 11. Then with six seconds left, the Texans gave the Saints way too much cushion. Brees hit Ginn for 9 yards, called a timeout, and that set up Lutz\u2019s kick. He probably wouldn\u2019t have hit it from 67 yards. The final 9 yards were huge.\n\nI want to be sure I get the picture accurate. Here is the #Texans\u2019 corner alignment on the play that gave up the yardage which allowed the field goal. Ted Ginn is in the slot. Why the corners aren\u2019t in press with the safeties over the top, I\u2019m not sure. pic.twitter.com/ktz2rI66bc \u2014 Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) September 10, 2019\n\nBrees is 40. When he was a rookie with the Chargers, Watson was 6. Watson already is a great quarterback. He showed that at Clemson and is showing it with the Texans.\n\nBut Brees isn\u2019t done giving us magical moments.\n\nNew Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees staged a comeback win in Week 1.
