Thanks to their stifling defensive line and another strong showing from back-up-cum-starting quarterback Kyle Allen, the Panthers bullied the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a punishing 37-26 win.\n\nIt was nowhere near that close. Tampa were miserable, with the chequered career of Jameis Winston taking another wayward step. In an error-strewn outing, he threw five interceptions while long-standing questions about his mechanics and decision-making remain.\n\nCarolina Panthers player Curtis Samuel celebrates scoring a touchdown in the fourth quarter\n\nCurtis Samuel makes the catch for the Panthers, under pressure from Tampa's Carlton Davis\n\nIt was the second NFL game to be played at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London\n\nBruce Arians has a reputation as quarterback whisperer, but he looks to have his work cut out here. Not just with Winston. His team lack offensive and defensive cohesion and produced special team blunders galore.\n\nAs starts go, it was a false one for Winston, and proved a litmus test of what was to come.\n\nWinston, who was intercepted for a touchdown with his first pass in the NFL against the Tennessee Titans in 2015, is no stranger to such events. Throwing to Mike Evans, who had zero catches in the loss at New Orleans last week, cornerback James Bradberry stole the ball out of the receiver\u2019s clutches on Tampa\u2019s 29.\n\nWhen the teams met in week two, the Bucs\u2019 defense was immoveable. So it proved on Carolina\u2019s opening possession, the Panthers losing two yards before they took the lead through Joey Slye\u2019s 49-yard field goal.\n\nAli Marpet and other Tampa Bay Buccaneers players head out of the tunnel for the match\n\nThree punts later, Carolina found themselves on their one-yard line. Allen had not completed a pass, but managed to engineer a 99 yard, 12 play drive to put Carolina in the driving seat.\n\nAfter finding Greg Olsen, Curtis Samuel and DJ Moore, it was left to McCaffrey to bundle over on fourth and inches to make it a two-score game. Despite back-to-back sacks from Gerald McCoy and Dontari Poe - soon followed by another from Brian Burns - the Bucs briefly breathed life into a one-sided encounter.\n\nBradley Pinion\u2019s punt was collected by Ray-Ray McCloud, Bucs cornerback Ryan Smith forced a fumble which was recovered by Kevin Minter and the Bucs were alive on Carolina\u2019s 37.\n\nJavien Elliott of the Carolina Panthers celebrates during the game against Tampa Bay\n\nWinston, who was sacked six times last week, dodged the blitz and after connected with tight end OJ Howard for a gain of 30. Running back Ronald Jones did the rest, finishing a five-yard touchdown run to put Tampa Bay on the board.\n\nGame on? Sadly not. After Winston threw his second interception of the afternoon, Carolina didn\u2019t look back. His wayward pass, thrown behind Howard, was gleefully collected by former Buc Javien Elliott.\n\nAfter Allen survived his own attempt to hand away possession, his pass to Olsen ruled incomplete after it came out of the tight end\u2019s clutches, it was McCaffrey who extended the advantage. He made it look simple, collecting Allen\u2019s short pass to the left, skipping three half-tackles in a 25-yard burst to the line.\n\nAfter showing small signs of life it was left to Winston to blow it deep in Carolina territory. He almost blew it, Vernon Butler ripping the ball out of his hand, but the Bucs somehow recovered it, despite four swarming white shirts. The following play he was not so fortunate.\n\nAgain, Winston held on to the ball for too long. Again, Butler got to the ball, knocking it out of his right hand. First on the scene was Obada, who flattened Winston, before Irvin recovered the ball.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Carl Nassib celebrates making a play in the second quarter\n\nAll Arians could do was scream on the sideline. With the clock dwindling down to half time, the incident was not over, Carolina handed a seldom seen free-kick from 60 yards after Brandon Zlystra made a fair catch from Pinion\u2019s punt.\n\nSlye sent a 60-yard attempt just short and Carolina led 17-7. Sometimes the break can revitalise a team.\n\nNot here. After Slye added a 46-yard field goal, Winston threw his third interception. Evans was the target, but Kuechly plucked the ball out of the air and marched upfield. Samuel did the rest, darting through from eight yards after a sweep to the right. The atmosphere audibly drained out of the stadium, there was barely a ripple when Bucs kicker Matt Gay hit a 54-yard field goal.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Cameron Brate makes a touchdown catch during the game\n\nAllen wasn\u2019t done running up the score. Using Olsen, Samuel and Moore, Allen marched Carolina upfield on another scoring drive. Samuel finished it with a 13-yard touchdown. Winston found Cameron Brate in the fourth, the 100th touchdown pass of his career, to reduce the arrears before Evans collected his tipped pass for the two-pointer to make it 34-18. After Bobo Wilson muffed a punt, Carolina added another field goal to put the game beyond doubt.\n\nThe scoring wasn\u2019t done there, Dare Ogunbowale rushing for a three-yard touchdown, with Winston adding the two-pointer with a run. But two further wayward throws from Winston, intercepted by Ross Cockrell and latterly Bradberry, rubber-stamped a priceless win for Carolina.\n\nAnd while they may have a quarterback controversy of their own on the horizon, it is small fry compared to the one going on in Tampa.\n\nBuccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston threw three interceptions during the match", "description": "PETE CARLINE AT TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM: A divisional win, two touchdowns for Christian McCaffrey, seven sacks and a cameo from Efe Obada.", "authors": ["Pete Carline For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/18/19661130-0-image-a-22_1570986061295.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
