More than 120,000 visitors had been going around 5m homes in the country in billeting services, and the majority of those people were Women\u2019s Voluntary Services (WVS) women,\u201d said Matthew McMurray, the keeper of heritage of the RVS (Royal Voluntary Service), as the WVS is now known.\n\nThe order to evacuate forthwith was made on 31 August 1939. But for more than a year a formidable female army had been recruited and trained, and was in place to execute it flawlessly.\n\nThey were recruited by Stella Isaacs, the Marchioness of Reading, whom McMurray called \u201cprobably one of the most important women in the world in the 20th century that nobody has heard of\u201d. The widow of the former viceroy of India, Rufus Isaacs, started the WVS in March 1938 and by 1940 had recruited more than 1 million women.\n\nArchives on the RVS website show her appeal, extolling her \u201cpersonal magnetism\u201d. \u201cShe had an equal magnetism for men and for women. You could go to any large social gathering and find all the men were surrounding Lady Reading, and the beautiful, young women left alone talking to each other,\u201d wrote one contemporary.\n\nMany of the WVS members were housewives and mothers, such as Nella Last, whose wartime diaries inspired Housewife, 49, the drama written by and starring the late Victoria Wood.\n\n\u201cThe housewives service was really about women who can\u2019t get out of their houses, doing small things to help. Become a WVS housewife, you have a card in your window. If your street gets bombed, you\u2019re the person everyone goes to for first aid, or for a cup of tea, or for the emergency services to go to to find out who is missing in your street,\u201d said McMurray.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stella Isaacs, the Marchioness of Reading, was labelled \u2018one of the most important women in the world in the 20th century that nobody has heard of\u2019.

The Red Army in Stalingrad were marching on socks knitted by WVS ladies in Britain. The WVS ran canteens for service personnel, clothes stores for evacuee children and food centres in bombed-out areas, and used furniture centres to help bombed-out people furnish new homes.\n\nThey collected salvage, including paper for wadding in bullets. Though they weren\u2019t supposed to, some even made molotov cocktails for the home guard.\n\nTheir duties were innumerable. In 1941, when younger women were required to register for work in factories, they provided nursery care.\n\n\u201cThis was completely different from the way the Axis powers saw women. Their role in Germany was to bring up the next generation of members of the Third Reich, not to help other people in the way we did in Britain,\u201d said McMurray.\n\nHe said of the evacuation: \u201cWhile it\u2019s chaos in those three days, it\u2019s really organised chaos.\u201d The WVS escorted children from their homes to stations, accompanied them on trains, picked them up at their destinations. More than 120,000 were working with the local authorities to make it happen.\n\nNot always to everyone\u2019s satisfaction. The WVS archives contain one disgruntled report from Caernarfon, north Wales, on receiving evacuee children and mothers. It reads: \u201cThe quota for mothers and babies was exceeded in every case and the type of person evacuated made it impossible to take them into an ordinary home.\u201d It described evacuated women as \u201cabusive, refused to be separated from their friends, and quite without manners and morals\u201d.\n\nAs bombing didn\u2019t start until the beginning of 1940, many of those evacuated in that first wave returned home, only to have to be evacuated all over again once the air raids began in earnest. A total of 3.75 million would eventually be evacuated.\n\nThe legacy of those original WVS members born in extraordinary circumstances is continued by the volunteer work RVS undertakes in hospitals and communities today.\n\n\u201cI would argue, and I think certain academics would as well, that those women won the war,\u201d added McMurray.", "description": "Women\u2019s Voluntary Services helped move 1.5 million people in three days after outbreak of WW2", "authors": ["Caroline Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/549cb2bdd3aa99e5175ea6ee8f038818ee2a4b0a/0_676_5218_3130/master/5218.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b048245391bccf7abfce12fbd76d082"}
