The Chinese government crushed a student-led demonstration for democratic reform and against government corruption, killing hundreds, or perhaps even thousands of demonstrators in the strongest anti-government protest since the 1949 revolution. Ironically, the name Tiananmen means 'Gate of Heavenly Peace'. This striking image received 23 per cent of the HISTORY channel vote\n\nBuzz Aldrin seen walking on the surface of the Moon in 1969.
