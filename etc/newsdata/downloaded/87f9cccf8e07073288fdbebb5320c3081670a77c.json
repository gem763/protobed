She's incredibly resilient. And that to me, is the definition of being brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt 4 p.m., Arianna had to go to her lesson. And \u2026 outside our door there were soldiers with machine guns,\u201d Agapi said. \u201cAnd the radio just announced that nobody's allowed to go out in the streets or they'll be shot, basically \u2026 (but) I see (Arianna) from our living room window, she\u2019s walking down our street and the soldiers say: \u2018You have to come back, you\u2019re not allowed out, what are you doing?\u2019 And she said: \u2018I have a class at four o\u2019clock and I can\u2019t miss it\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt was a turbulent time for Greece: a political crisis in 1965 had created civil unrest and in 1967, the country\u2019s monarch, King Constantine II, was exiled after a military coup. One afternoon, when Huffington was 15, Athens was under army occupation, but she was due to attend a class.\n\n\u201cI remember the conversation. And my mother saying: \u2018But Agapi loves her daddy so much. She's going to be so upset.\u2019 And (Arianna) said: \u2018Mommy, she'll grow out of it. It's very important that we're all happy. And if you and Daddy are fighting, it's not happy for anybody.\u2019 She was 12. And she had this wisdom and this insight that what really mattered was that \u2026 we were able to be in an environment that was more peaceful,\u201d she told \u201cThe Brave Ones.\u201d\n\nTheir father, Konstantinos, was a journalist taken to a Nazi camp during World War II for writing an anti-German article. He survived the concentration camp and married Elli, but the relationship was troubled. As a girl, Huffington encouraged her mother to leave her father, Agapi recalls.\n\nrianna Huffington was born Ariadni-Anna Stasinopoulou in 1950 and she and her sister Agapi were raised by their mother Elli in a one-bedroom apartment in Athens, Greece.\n\n\u201c My mother used to say that failure is not the opposite of your success, it\u2019s a stepping stone to your success.\u201d\n\nAnother time, Huffington was coming home from school and she saw a picture of Cambridge University on the cover of a magazine. \u201cI bought the magazine and put it on the kitchen table and said to my mom: \u2018I really want to go there,\u2019\u201d she told CNBC.\n\n\u201cAnd my mom didn't say: \u2018Don't be ridiculous, you don't speak English, we don't have money, I'm sure it's hard even for English girls to get into Cambridge.\u2019 My mother said: \u2018Let's see how we can make that happen\u2019.\u201d\n\nHer mother didn\u2019t make her feel as if Cambridge was do or die. \u201cShe always made me feel that it was a grand adventure. And that if we didn't succeed, if we didn't get into Cambridge, life was still a grand adventure and there would be other things. And that she wouldn't love me any less,\u201d Huffington recalled.\n\nThe two visited the university, \u201ca kind of early version of visualization, to imagine myself in that place,\u201d she said, and Huffington got in on a partial scholarship.\n\nArianna on: Death \u201cI have absolutely zero interest in a legacy or how I'm remembered. Because for me there's something else after death. And is just incredibly strengthening, the recognition that death is not the end. Which is not an intellectual recognition, it's just something I very deeply believe (and) makes me kind of understand why Romans and Greeks encouraged people to remember that death is an inevitable part of life. I just wrote a piece where I quoted The Onion headline that death rate remains at 100%. And that's not out of morbidity, but it's out of \u2014 putting everything in perspective.\u201d\n\nShe studied economics at Girton College and became the third woman president of the Cambridge Union, a process that involved some determination, in part because of her heavy Greek accent. \u201cThere was a lot of snobbery around accents. And when I first stood up to speak \u2026 I was a terrible speaker, I was reading every word, and I had this heavy accent. So, people kind of wrote me off. And I persevered just because I really loved it. And also because again, back to my mother, it was OK if I failed.\u201d\n\nAgapi describes their young lives as a world that was \u201ca big stage, a playground where you can really experiment, you can try things.\u201d\n\nFailing was OK too. \u201cWe had very little money, but my mother had always made us believe in ourselves beyond our circumstances. My mother used to say that failure is not the opposite of your success, it\u2019s a stepping stone to your success,\u201d Huffington said.\n\nHuffington became an author after a publisher saw her on a televised Cambridge Union debate on the changing role of women. He wrote to ask if she could write a book about it, but she declined, saying she couldn\u2019t write. Meeting her for lunch, he persuaded her, and she published \u201cThe Female Woman,\u201d in 1974, a riposte to Germaine Greer\u2019s \u201cThe Female Eunuch.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was basically arguing in favor (that) of course women should have every right, every opportunity, equal pay, all the things that we take for granted now, but also, we don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater and denigrate women with children or who choose not to pursue a career,\u201d Huffington explained.\n\n\u201cAnd because the book was a success, after that, everybody wanted me to write more on women. But I feel I had said absolutely everything I knew about women. I was 24,\u201d she told \u201cThe Brave Ones.\u201d Instead, she worked on a book about political leadership, but it was rejected 37 times, and she wondered whether her first book had been a fluke. She managed to get a loan from a London bank and finally got her book, \u201cAfter Reason,\u201d published in 1978.\n\n\u201c By the time I was 30, I really knew I wanted to have children. And I felt that if I had stayed in London, I would not have the courage to leave him. So, I put the Atlantic Ocean between us and moved to New York.\u201d Arianna Huffington\n\nShe had been dating the journalist Bernard Levin, after they both appeared on \u201cFace the Music,\u201d a classical music quiz show on BBC TV, but Huffington broke off the relationship when she realized he never wanted to marry or have children.\n\n\u201cBy the time I was 30, I really knew I wanted to have children. And I felt that if I had stayed in London, I would not have the courage to leave him. So, I put the Atlantic Ocean between us and moved to New York.\u201d\n\nShe continued writing: Biographies of Maria Callas and Pablo Picasso followed and in 1986 she married oil heir and merchant banker Michael Huffington, who went on to become a Republican congressman from 1993 to 1995. They had two children together and divorced in 1997. But even for Huffington, this personal crisis was an opportunity to help others.\n\nArianna on: Being an 'older' founder \u201cI love talking about the fact that I launched The Huffington Post at 55. And I launched Thrive Global at 66. So the founder game is not just a young person's game. And it's sort of great to know that, and to know that you don't have to get everything done and know exactly the career path you want to follow when you leave college.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always felt when I learned something, I wanted to share it if it would help others. And the same happened with my personal realizations. When I went through a divorce with two young children, I wanted to talk about the importance of co-parenting,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou know, obviously, if you are getting divorced, you're angry, you're resentful. And yet, you share these children together. And how can you put your anger and resentment aside? Not ignore it, but not let it affect the way you co-parent. And so, my ex-husband and I, we're really able to do that. It wasn't easy.\u201d\n\nHuffington added a \u201cDivorce\u201d section to HuffPost in 2010 and discussed how she and her ex-husband eventually became friends in 2014.", "description": "Arianna Huffington was raised in a one-bedroom apartment in Athens, Greece and went on to write 15 books on topics from Picasso to sleep.
