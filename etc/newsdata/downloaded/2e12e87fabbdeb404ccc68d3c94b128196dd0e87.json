If you think about it, when you are getting children ready for senior school, you are starting to let them walk home. You start giving them that bit of freedom.\u201d\n\nBarnardo\u2019s, which has a statutory role with police to tackle child exploitation, said research from its frontline staff found 30 per cent reported an increase in gangs using \u201cclean skins\u201d - defined as children with no criminal record from middle class backgrounds.\n\nOf the 38 per cent of staff that had actually dealt with at least one child being criminally exploited, almost two thirds (62 per cent) said it involved selling drugs.\n\nMs Gradwell cited one case of a middle class child whose parents had disciplined him by \u201cgrounding him\u201d at home and taken away his mobile phone.\n\nSo sophisticated is the intelligence networks of the gangs that he was identified and befriended. \u201cThe young lad got chatting with a gang member who offered him his spare phone,\u201d said Ms Gradwell.\n\n\u201cThey got friendly, then the next stage was: \u2018I gave you a phone when you most needed it, now can you do me a favour and drop this package off.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter a series of similar jobs, he started getting a cut of the money, at which point the gang set up a \u201cmugging\u201d in which the drugs were stolen from the child. \u201cHe could not pay for them and became indebted,\u201d said Ms Gradwell.\n\n\u201cSome never get out of that. Luckily, he did. We got him some help through his school to detach him from it.\u201d", "description": "Children as young as nine are being recruited by county lines gangs as they increasingly target middle class \u201cclean skins\u201d to run drugs, the crime chief for Britain\u2019s biggest children\u2019s charity has revealed.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Jacob Rees-Mogg", "Ross Clark", "Daniel Hannan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212710122-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
