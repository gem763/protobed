Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the committee\u2019s chairman. \u201cTheir goal is broader: to sow societal discord and erode public confidence in the machinery of government. By flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, Russia is trying to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough the 85-page report itself had extensive redactions, in the visible sections, lawmakers urged their peers in Congress to act, including through the potential adoption of new regulations that would the disclosure of ad buyers more transparent. The report also called on the White House and the executive branch to adopt a more forceful, public role, warning Americans about the ways in which dangerous misinformation can spread while creating new teams within the U.S. government to monitor for threats and share intelligence with industry.\n\nThe recommendations call for Silicon Valley to more extensively share intelligence among companies, in recognition of the shortage of such sharing in 2016 and also the ways that disinformation from Russia and other countries spreads across numerous platforms \u2014 with posts linking back and forth in a tangle of connections.\n\n\u201cThe Committee found that Russia\u2019s targeting of the 2016 U.S. presidential election was part of a broader, sophisticated and ongoing information warfare campaign,\u201d the report says. The Russian effort was \u201ca vastly more complex and strategic assault on the United States than was initially understood... an increasingly brazen interference by the Kremlin on the citizens and democratic institutions of the United States.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe committee report recounts extensive Russian manipulation of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Google and other major platforms with the goal of dividing Americans, suppressing African American turnout and helping elect Trump president. Tuesday\u2019s report, the second volume of the committee\u2019s final report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, offered the most detailed set of recommendations so far for stiffening the nation\u2019s defenses against foreign interference online \u2014 now a routine tactic for many nations.\n\nWhile the report tracks closely with the previous findings of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s special counsel report and several independent researchers, the comprehensiveness and forcefulness of the report\u2019s conclusions are striking in light of Trump\u2019s efforts to minimize the impact of Russian interference in the election that brought him to office. The release also comes amid a burgeoning impeachment inquiry over whether Trump sought foreign help \u2014 from Ukraine and others \u2014 to help his reelection chances in 2020.\n\nThe White House defended its response to the Russian interference. \u201cUnlike the Obama Administration, which allowed foreign adversaries to infiltrate our infrastructure, the Trump Administration has made election security a priority and has taken action,\u201d spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. \u201cThe Federal government has invested in essential programs and is proactively partnering with states to improve protection of election infrastructure and to elevate threat awareness through improved information sharing and exercises. This is in sharp contrast to the past Administration who not only knew of attempts to break our election security but did nothing to stop it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump has questioned findings by U.S. intelligence officials that the 2016 election was a target of Russian manipulation, and the president has sometimes embraced conservative conspiracy theories even as federal investigators have detailed efforts to interfere through fake social media accounts, leaks of stolen Democratic Party documents and hacks into state voting systems.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee backed the views of other federal officials regarding the sweep and goals of the Russian effort, saying that the operation \u201csought to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election by harming Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of success and supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nThe White House, say numerous researchers and outside critics, has failed to lead the kind of aggressive government-wide effort they argue would protect the 2020 race, though some federal agencies took steps to address foreign threats more forcefully during the 2018 congressional election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat included a cyber operation that disrupted Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, based in St. Petersburg, on Election Day. Mueller indicted the agency and 13 affiliated Russians for their alleged role in 2016 election interference, which played a central role as well in Mueller\u2019s landmark final report, released in April.\n\n\u201cWith the 2020 elections on the horizon, there\u2019s no doubt that bad actors will continue to try to weaponize the scale and reach of social media platforms to erode public confidence and foster chaos,\u201d said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat. \u201cThe Russian playbook is out in the open for other foreign and domestic adversaries to expand upon \u2014 and their techniques will only get more sophisticated.\u201d\n\nLawmakers delivered their recommendations just days after new revelations of possible election interference jolted Washington. On Friday, Microsoft announced it had discovered Iranian-linked hackers had targeted the personal email accounts associated with a number of current and former government officials, journalists writing on global affairs, and at least one presidential candidate\u2019s campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMicrosoft declined to name the affected campaign and said the account was not compromised. Still, the Iranian effort highlighted the lingering aftermath of Russia\u2019s online efforts three years ago, as other countries around the world now seek to adopt the Kremlin\u2019s tactics, turning disinformation and other forms of election interference into a global phenomenon.\n\nIran has joined Russia as a leader in foreign online interference. The list of countries known to have conducted such operations also includes Saudi Arabia, Israel, China, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Venezuela, say researchers. A report by Oxford University\u2019s Computational Propaganda Project said last month that at least 70 nations have sought to manipulate voters and others online, though most meddle mainly in their own domestic politics.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee also has documented extensive Russia efforts to manipulate American voting systems.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the first volume of the committee\u2019s report, released in July, lawmakers said that voting systems in all 50 states probably had been targeted by Russian agents in some manner. While that volume affirmed that votes had not been changed or compromised during the 2016 election, it concluded that the U.S. government had fallen far short in its security responsibilities by failing to warn state officials, who oversee elections, and provide them with sufficient actionable threat information.\n\nLast year\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee report on social media manipulation found Facebook in particular was key to reaching African Americans and conservative voters. The 20 most popular Facebook pages run by the Russians \u2014 with names such as \u201cBeing Patriotic,\u201d \u201cBlacktivist\u201d and \u201cArmy of Jesus\u201d \u2014 generated 39 million likes, 31 million shares, 5.4 million reactions and 3.4 million comments. The Russian campaign reached as many as 126 million people on Facebook and 20 million more on Instagram, company officials reported to Congress.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report described how efforts to manipulate Americans over social media operated in multiple steps. Fake accounts operating from Russia started by ingratiating themselves into online conversations using nonpolitical comments, then switched to overtly partisan content.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Russian-created \u201cArmy of Jesus\u201d Facebook group, for example, on Oct. 26, 2016 \u2014 less than two weeks before the presidential vote \u2014 said, \u201cThere has never been a day when people did not need to walk with Jesus.\u201d\n\nThen on Nov. 1, with the election approaching, the same \u201cArmy of Jesus\u201d page said, \u201cHILLARY APPROVES REMOVAL OF GOD FROM THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.\u201d\n\nThe report also noted that the paid advertisements on Facebook, Instagram and other platforms were much less important than the free viral context created by teams of Russian disinformation operatives working across multiple platforms.\n\nAndy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the tech giant since 2016 has \u201cstepped up our efforts to build strong defenses on multiple fronts,\u201d including efforts to detect fake accounts and remove coordinated efforts to spread misinformation on the site. In September, Facebook hosted U.S. government officials and other tech company representatives to discuss ways to safeguard the 2020 election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said, \u201cWe\u2019ve made significant progress since the 2016 U.S. election to address, mitigate, and prevent future attempts to undermine the integrity of online conversation regarding elections and the democratic process.\u201d\n\nGoogle spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said, \u201cWe\u2019ve invested significantly to detect phishing and hacking attempts, identify foreign interference, and protect campaigns from digital attacks. We\u2019ll continue this work and will keep sharing information with law enforcement and industry.\u201d\n\nInstagram, which is owned by Facebook and has grown increasingly influential in recent years, played a key role the Russian disinformation campaign. The top 10 accounts run by the Russian operatives were designed to appeal to specific groups, including African Americans, veterans and gay people. The names of the accounts included, \u201c@Blackstagram,\u201d \u201c@american.veterans,\u201d \u201c@rainbow_nation,\u201d \u201c@afrokingdom,\u201d \u201cfeminism_tag\u201d and \u201c@cop_block_us.\u201d", "description": "The Senate Intelligence Committee said in blunt language that Russians worked to damage Democrat Hillary Clinton while bolstering Republican Donald Trump \u2014 and made clear that fresh rounds of interference are likely ahead of the 2020 vote.", "authors": ["Craig Timberg", "National Reporter Covering Technology", "Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PUFZwUspVPs5eSiXzLNBGTPZlZ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YV5I7ZXAVII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
