He said on Twitter: \u201cWe may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.\u201d\n\nAfter threatening to \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it did anything \u201coff-limits\u201d in the planned offensive, Trump talked up Washington\u2019s relationship with Turkey. \u201cSo many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United State,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso remember, and importantly, that Turkey is an important member in good standing of Nato.\u201d\n\nWith his rhetorical U-turns and mixed messages, Trump has been publicly coming to terms with policy dilemmas that constrained his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nThe US cannot afford to worsen its already poor relationship with Turkey and cannot contemplate a military clash with a Nato ally. On the other hand, there is considerable US support, particularly in the Republican party, for standing by the Kurds, who died fighting alongside the US against Isis.\n\nThe compromise until Sunday was an effort to establish a demilitarised cordon along the Turkish-Syrian border, patrolled jointly by the Turkish and US forces. That was ultimately torpedoed by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s insistence that the 20-mile-deep zone should be resettled by Syrian Arab refugees, and that Turkish forces establish outposts inside the zone.\n\nWhen Erdo\u011fan told Trump of his intention to invade, Trump agreed to withdraw the US troops in the zone and to try to sell it as the fulfilment of his election promise to bring troops home and to stop America\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d.\n\nWhite House officials insisted no US troops would be withdrawn from Syria, but that between 50 and 100 special forces would be redeployed from the border zone to more secure positions in Syria.\n\nNicholas Danforth, a visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund who studies US-Turkey relations, said: \u201cTrump came through for Erdo\u011fan in a big way. Now Erdo\u011fan has to decide how far to press his luck before provoking a backlash from the US congress or even Trump himself.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s unpredictability is a double-edged sword for Ankara. The problem is the territorial gains Turkey makes in Syria will be immediate and obvious. The full cost of antagonising Washington will appear more slowly.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish military carried out strikes targeting the Syrian-Iraqi border overnight to prevent Kurdish forces from reinforcing in preparation for the offensive, two Turkish officials told Reuters on Tuesday. It was not clear what damage was caused or whether there were casualties.\n\n'There will be chaos once again': Kurds respond to Trump's Syria decision Read more\n\nIn Turkey, there has been a mixed reaction to news of the planned assault. Turkey\u2019s fragile lira dropped nine cents to 5.80 against the dollar after Trump tweeted a threat of more sanctions on Monday.\n\n\u201cPeople are wondering if the campaign is being used to cover up the economic distress and declining Justice and Development party [Erdogan\u2019s ruling AKP] votes,\u201d said Asl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cThe diplomatic process with the US and SDF [on the creation of a safe zone on the border] to satisfy Turkey\u2019s security needs has been very active and progress was being made. This decision appears rushed and risky. One worries Turkey could stumble into a situation here where rather than just establish a safe zone, instead a war could escalate very quickly.\u201d\n\nNationalistic sentiment is already being drummed up on online. Turkey\u2019s national defence ministry posted several clips of heroic Turkish soldiers set to rock music and snippets of the national anthem on its social media accounts. \u201cWe will come back war veterans or we will come back martyrs,\u201d one post read.\n\nYusuf Erim, a political analyst familiar with the Turkish government\u2019s thinking, said that with Isis defeated as a territorial entity this year and given the appeal of sending back up to 2 million of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey \u2013 a move Ankara insists does not amount to demographic engineering \u2013 the operation\u2019s timing made sense.\n\n\u201cTrump actually wanted to withdraw in December 2018, so this is not an unplanned idea,\u201d Erim said. \u201cNeither the US nor Turkey wants a unilateral Turkish operation that would risk a confrontation between the US and Turkish troops. This is a proposal that was on the shelf but has been dusted off and brought back. It\u2019s not a spontaneous thing.\u201d", "description": "Syrian Kurds seek Russia talks, and Donald Trump changes tone on US withdrawal", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan", "Julian Borger", "Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea81ae3bfa15ea32930675559fea0fa3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
