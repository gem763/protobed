REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nNetherlands-listed Prosus last week made an unsolicited $6.3 billion cash bid to buy Just Eat, which had already agreed to an all-share offer from rival Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS).\n\nCat Rock said in a statement that the sale of shares in Just Eat undertaken by Delivery Hero of Germany (DHER.DE) \u201cdirectly and materially harmed\u201d Just Eat shareholders.\n\nProsus owns a 22.3% stake in Delivery Hero, and the pair are considered \u201cconcert\u201d parties. In September, before Prosus\u2019s bid for Takeaway.com was announced, Delivery Hero began selling down its stake of 8 million shares, or 13% in Takeaway, by 3 million shares.\n\nCat Rock said that was being done to keep Takeaway\u2019s share price low and make its bid for Just Eat appear unattractive.\n\n\u201cDelivery Hero structured its share sales in a bizarre and uneconomic fashion that seems deliberately intended to depress Takeaway.com\u2019s stock price in the run-up to the shareholder vote on a merger with Just Eat,\u201d Cat Rock said.\n\nProsus could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nTakeaway agreed to buy Just Eat in August in a deal that would create one of the biggest food delivery groups outside China, with leadership in Britain, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nA slide in Takeaway\u2019s shares, however, has reduced the value of its bid from an original 731 pence a share to 594 pence.\n\nCat Rock owns roughly 3%, or around 17.7 million shares, of Just Eat, as well as 34 million, or 5.6%, of Takeaway shares.\n\n\u201cWe and Just Eat shareholders are happy to consider fair proposals from Prosus,\u201d Cat Rock said.", "description": "Investor Cat Rock Capital on Monday accused internet conglomerate Prosus of undermining the sale process of British food delivery business Just Eat , which is the focus of a bidding war in the fast-growing sector.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445758719&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0EB", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
