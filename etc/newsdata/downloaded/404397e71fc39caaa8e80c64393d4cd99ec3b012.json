The original dish featured instant noodles (without the flavour pack) simmered in satay broth that had been used to cook hotpot ingredients, so the soup, I imagine (since I wasn't there), must have been very richly flavoured.\n\nI tried making a version by adapting my usual satay recipe, combining both the marinade and the sauce and increasing the amount of some ingredients while using less of others. To my surprise, it worked.\n\nThis a very rich soup that makes a delicious, hearty lunch on a cold day. But if you like, use the satay soup as my friend did - poach hotpot ingredients in it first, then when you're almost full, boil some udon noodles and put them into bowls, add a few pieces of thinly sliced beef, and ladle the hot broth over the top before adding the garnishes.\n\nYou can make the spice paste by pounding the ingredients in a large mortar, or by grinding them in a high-speed blender (such as a NutriBullet). For the peanuts, however, use a mortar, not a blender, so they have more texture; you don't want to end up with peanut butter. If you don't have a mortar, roughly chop the nuts.\n\nBuy the thinly sliced beef intended for hotpot, sukiyaki or shabu-shabu, using lean or fatty meat, whichever you like.\n\nIf you want to make a vegan version of this dish, use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, and substitute bean curd puffs (or pan-fried firm bean curd) for the sliced beef.\n\nFried shallots are sold in the Thai and Vietnamese section of supermarkets. If you can't find them, make your own by frying thinly sliced shallots in oil until brown (about 5 minutes). Drain them on paper towels, then spread them on a tray and bake them until crisp in a 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) oven.", "description": "The recipe for this noodle dish was inspired by a picture I saw on a friend's Instagram feed.
