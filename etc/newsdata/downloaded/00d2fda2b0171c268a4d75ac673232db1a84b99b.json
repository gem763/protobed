It sounds brutal\u2026. The girls seem to have it much harder?\u201d Ms. Hilderbrand posted.\n\nResponses poured in, and Ms. Hilderbrand couldn\u2019t stop reading. \u201cThere were literally hundreds of stories about the way the girls have to get up at 6 in the morning and get their hose on,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were mothers on there who were completely heartbroken \u2014 \u2018My daughter was a legacy and she didn\u2019t get in and her best friend and her roommate got in.\u2019 Every comment was a novel, and it was breaking my heart.\u201d\n\nParents also rely on college groups to ask about mattress toppers, frown on difficult professors (\u201cMy daughter is very good in math, but her professor isn\u2019t teaching at all,\u201d read a recent post in a Clemson mothers group), arrange \u201ccare-package parties\u201d and set up parent \u201csip and sobs\u201d near campus after drop-off.\n\nSome look for help finding their children roommates; others complain about them. There are bucking Buckeyes. \u201cI need a little advice!\u201d read a recent post on the Ohio State University (OSU) Parents group. \u201cMy daughter called me at 5:30 a.m. saying she had been sitting in the common room since 3 a.m. because while she was asleep her roommate had came in and woke her up because she was having sex in the room!\u201d", "description": "Cure for the empty nest or parental monitoring gone awry?", "authors": ["Gail O Connor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/fashion/10PARENTFB/10PARENTFB-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
