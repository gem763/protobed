And he said that Tories who rebel during the passage of the bill through parliament could expect the same treatment.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister obviously respects that there is a number of hardworking colleagues who have been with the party for a very long time,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cBut the chief whip had very clear conversations with people telling them that if you vote for a mechanism that takes power from the government and gives it to the opposition, this would be a matter of confidence. That was repeated to them and they took their decision.\u201d\n\nBut former party chairman Kenneth Baker called for the 21 \u2013 now sitting in the Commons as independents \u2013 to be allowed to stand again for the Conservatives at the next election.\n\n\u201cThese 21 MPs are not parvenus seeking to infiltrate the party, they are lifelong Tories in their mind and in their bones,\u201d said Lord Baker.\n\nHe warned the party owes its success to being a broad church which had kept policy decisions out of the hands of \u201cswivel-eyed ideologues\u201d.\n\nMr Stewart, who was a candidate in the recent Tory leadership race, said he was told about the decision to withdraw the whip by text message.\n\nHe confirmed he still hopes to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election, and said the decision to bar him and other rebels was \u201cnot a Conservative way of behaving\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not lost my party, I\u2019ve just been temporarily suspended,\u201d said the former international development secretary.\n\n\u201cI would like to stand as a Conservative for the Conservative Party and I have full confidence that the government will eventually realise that this is no way to treat a party because in the end we have to bring the country together. This has to be about compromise.\n\n\u201cOne of the strongest reasons why this is the wrong thing to do is because to deliver Brexit like this is to create a poison pill which for 40 years will divide this country straight down the middle.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to deliver Brexit at all, try to do it legally, constitutionally and with consent.\u201d\n\nThe president of Penrith and the Border Conservatives, Robert Craig, said he would be \u201cstunned\u201d if members did not select Mr Stewart to continue as their candidate.\n\n\u201cIf we decide, as I would expect we will, to back Rory, I think CCHQ are basically going to have to dissolve us,\u201d Mr Craig told the Press Association.\n\n\u201cIt would be tragic to lose someone of Rory\u2019s intellect and standing from politics at exactly the wrong time.\u201d\n\nBut business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said: \u201cOn this central issue, on this key question of Brexit, he chose to vote against the government and chose essentially to give control of the order paper to the opposition.\n\n\u201cIt was very clearly stated that Conservative MPs would lose the whip. Now 21 of them out of 312 \u2013 that is about 6 per cent \u2013 chose to vote against the government and they had the whip withdrawn. That was very clear.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think it is a shame \u2013 a lot of them are very talented people. But you cannot have people standing as Conservative MPs when they are against the Government\u2019s policy on the key issue of the day.\u201d\n\nLocal Conservative associations in the constituencies of Sir Oliver Letwin, Dominic Grieve, Guto Bebb and Margot James indicated that they would be seeking new candidates.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, said Mr Johnson and his chief of staff Dominic Cummings were \u201cdestroying\u201d their own party.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cTo be honest, removing the whip from well-regarded Tory MPs that have served their party for years amounts to Johnson and Cummings destroying their own party. That will not end well.\u201d\n\nReacting to the treatment of Sir Nicholas, European parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt tweeted: \u201cSir Winston Churchill was a founding father of the European Union, convinced that only a united Europe could guarantee peace. He would surely be stunned about the state of today\u2019s Conservative Party.\u201d", "description": "A Conservative grandee kicked out of the party for voting against Boris Johnson on Tuesday has accused the prime minister and members of his cabinet of \u201cserial disloyalty\u201d.
