It is a critical financial service as it provides authenticity and transparency to business transactions.\n\n\u201cLending\u201d is rerouting of money by the banks as lending agents to the businessmen. Though it is a service, but it is actually a business activity aimed at making money.\n\n\u201cLoaning\u201d is a state-supported lending via banks to the poor and the marginalised and hence it is not with the intention of profit-making.\n\nSo, under one roof of a bank, we have diverse activities, and that is where a unique-to-India financial schizophrenia starts, that causes a farmer who has taken a loan of fifty thousand rupees from a bank to commit suicide, while a liquor baron can be lent thousands of crores by the same bank and he can live life king-size even after not paying back.\n\nAs India can\u2019t hope to go all capitalist overnight, we have to accept that we will be using banks as social institutions and hence the first rethinking we need to do is about separation of commercial lending from the other two activities that need not be looked for profiteering.\n\nThe transactional services provided by banks can actually move out of the banks and shift to a national backbone that facilitates interpersonal money-movement. Unique ID system can be used to access this platform whereby the archaic idea of \u201copening a bank account\u201d can be set aside.\n\nAs we are a nation yet to achieve internet-literacy that can allow a total shift, we should accept cash money transactions to be around for a while, but it would be worth considering the idea of phasing out (and not demonetising) currency with large denomination to ensure that large transactions move to digital platforms.\n\nThe loaning activity of a bank needs to be taken out onto a completely separate platform where the nature of documentation required and terms of lending money are not same as that of commercial lending.\n\nThe biggest banking reform that our poor need is a complete rethinking in how they can borrow money from the common kitty of the state. The conventional banking ideas like \u201ccollateral security\u201d or \u201cprime lending rates\u201d need to go out of the window and a de novo process should be put in place for small borrowers.\n\nOn the other hand, the money lent for businesses requires to get further regulated by more stringent processes that discourage siphoning of money.\n\nHere the lenders need to be more professional and hence it is worth considering a complete separation of these lenders from the loaning and banking activities.\n\nIf we divide the current banking space into two or three parts, it will obviously create an issue about how they will engage with each other.\n\nAt this point, the same bank takes money from people, offers them transactional services, gives them interest on their money and uses the same money to lend to other people, so it creates an illusion of a seamless organisation that handles various aspects of money, but in reality, a modern bank is a dinosaur from an era where computerisation and digitalisation did not exist.\n\nAs we move forward, most of the advantages of keeping all these activities under one roof are gone and what we are left with is a bank as a confused entity doing almost contradicting activities.\n\nThe net result is, as a commercial body, a bank ends up mixing not just causes by balance sheets also. The problem emerging from one sector thus move into other. So, we see strange developments like PMC bank crisis where average citizens are finding their accounts frozen for no fault of theirs.\n\nThe current problems with Indian banking sector are not borne only of the greed of corporates as we like to believe. They have appeared due to the mixing of agendas and policies and the loopholes this mixing as created.\n\nWe need banking reforms go beyond the RBI driven fiscal policies and the most critical of them is separation of activities that, by their very nature are conflicting.", "description": "While India is surely fighting a war on various economic fronts, if we want to reduce all such problems, they all will boil down to the inefficient way money is distributed across the society, and...", "authors": ["Samir Shukla"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
