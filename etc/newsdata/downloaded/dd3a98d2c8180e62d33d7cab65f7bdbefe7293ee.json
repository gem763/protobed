The new Arlo Video Doorbell differentiates itself with a field-of-view that\u2019s both tall and wide (aka, square) in order to show you faces as well as packages dropped in front of the door.\n\nArlo\u2019s late entry into video doorbells is nevertheless packed with modern features. For example, it starts streaming video to your phone over Wi-Fi just as soon as the doorbell is pressed. You then have the option to send pre-recorded messages like \u201cleave the package by the door\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll be right there\u201d in addition to starting a two-way audio conversation.\n\nThere\u2019s also a built-in siren that will tigger automatically when someone attempts to yank the doorbell off the wall. It can also be sounded remotely to warn off suspected ruffians and louts. Otherwise, you get a max video resolution of 1536 x 1536 with HDR, night vision, a 12x digital zoom, and motion detection (with activity zones) alerts and recordings.\n\nThe Arlo Video Doorbell is for wired electrical installations only, and connects to existing mechanical or digital chimes. Yes it\u2019s user installable, but it\u2019s not as idiot-proof as a battery-powered doorbell like the August View or Ring Video Doorbell 2.\n\nThe Arlo Video Doorbell is available to preorder now for $149.99, and comes with a free trial of the company\u2019s 30-day recording history service. After three months, it\u2019ll cost you a minimum of $2.99 each month to continue.", "description": "The new Arlo Video Doorbell differentiates itself with a field-of-view that\u2019s both tall and wide (aka, square) in order to show you faces as well as packages dropped in front of the door.
