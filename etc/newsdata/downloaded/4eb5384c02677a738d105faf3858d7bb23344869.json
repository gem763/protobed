(AP) - California is looking to tighten the rules about children under 13 using social media.\n\nThe state Senate voted 31-4 on Thursday to require social media companies to first get the consent of a parent or guardian before creating an account for a child the company knows is under 13.\n\nFederal law already requires social media companies to get parental consent before collecting or selling data of children under 13. That\u2019s why most social media companies, including Facebook, already ban children under 13 from creating accounts.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Henry Stern says the bill will protect children. But Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener says the bill would harm LGBT youth who live in abusive households by isolating them from others like them.\n\nThe bill now heads to the state Assembly.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "California is looking to tighten the rules about children under 13 using social media.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
