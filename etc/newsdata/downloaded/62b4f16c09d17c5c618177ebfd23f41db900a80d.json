Grammarly did not disclose minority investors.\n\nThis is the company's second raise. It raised $110 million in a 2017 round that was also led by General Catalyst and IVP, as well as Spark Capital.\n\nThe company says it has 20 million daily active users on its various services, including users in more than 2,000 businesses and institutions.\n\nHow it works: Grammarly checks spelling and grammar for free, and paying users get more sophisticated suggestions about accuracy, precision, formality, and style.\n\nSome of the new money will go toward more features for business users, Hoover says \u2014 but the company isn't launching any new enterprise products.\n\nIt currently sells a \"Grammarly for Business\" subscription, which allows access to the tool for an entire business team, like a sales or customer support group.\n\nOne coming feature will help writers follow corporate style guides, Hoover says. He wouldn't say what other changes are planned, beyond a push to \"extend the availability of Grammarly within the enterprise.\"\n\nYes, but: The renewed focus on business stirs up privacy questions, because Grammarly has to have access to what users write to be able to offer suggestions.", "description": "That's a lot of money for an announcement without any new products or sources of revenue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/MjLN-eb7Yje56xw-yME3pD3vraQ=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570659160632.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
