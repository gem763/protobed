But Trump and his campaign have tried to turn the inquiry his way, accusing Democrats of using the Constitutional process to try to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming after and fighting you and we never lose,\u201d he said, predicting the 2020 election will be \u201ca landslide\u201d for Republicans, despite polling showing him lagging behind.\n\nTrump also continued his attacks on former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter\u2019s work for a Ukraine energy company. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Biden family are at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 inquiry into whether Trump compromised national security and used his office to try to bolster his 2020 chances by pushing foreign governments to investigate one of his Democratic rivals.\n\nTrump\u2019s day included a tour of a new Louis Vuitton leather workshop in north central Texas and a fundraiser in Fort Worth that, combined with a pre-rally reception in Dallas, brought in $5.5 million, according to the Republican National Committee.\n\nTexas is a crucial state for Republicans, both in terms of money and votes.\n\nTrump carried the GOP stronghold and its 38 Electoral College votes by 9 points in 2016. But Democrats have pointed to demographic changes \u2014 as well as the fact that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz won reelection by less than 3 points last year \u2014 as evidence that the second-most-populous state could soon be in play. But Trump rejected that thinking, as he urged his supporters to re-elect Cruz and John Cornyn, the state\u2019s other Republican senator.\n\nAs he campaigns for a second term, Trump\u2019s team has tried to focus attention on economic gains over the last three years, including the low unemployment rate. Pressing that message, Trump cut the ribbon at a new production facility for the luxury brand Louis Vuitton in Alvarado with his elder daughter, Ivanka.\n\nTrump joked that the company, which is known for its logoed handbags and luggage, has cost him \u201ca lot of money over the years.\u201d His wife, first lady Melania Trump, has repeatedly been spotted traveling with the brand.\n\n\u201cThis workshop will soon employ 500 of the most highly skilled workers anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo one can match the precision and perfection of an American artisan.\u201d\n\nThe Texas visit comes at a treacherous time for Trump, whose dealings with the president of Ukraine are under fire. While Republicans have largely rallied around him, they sounded alarms over his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeast Syria \u2014 a move that paved the way for Turkey to invade and assault the Kurds, who\u2019d fought alongside the U.S. in its campaign against Islamic State militants.\n\nAt his rally, Trump credited his \u201cunconventional\u201d approach for the announcement of a cease-fire Thursday. And he repeatedly painted the Turkish assault on the Kurds as something that had its benefits.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to let them fight, like two kids in a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign and the RNC have been raking in record money, raising $125 million in the third quarter of 2019 and smashing the just over $70 million former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised in the third quarter of 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s would-be challengers are deep in an increasingly contentious race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nOne of those candidates, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, was holding a counter-rally protesting Trump\u2019s appearance in nearby Grand Prairie Thursday evening. He did the same when Trump held a rally in El Paso in February and drew a substantial crowd, but his standing in the race has since fallen.\n\nStill, Trump make sure to call him out, pointing to his plan to confiscate assault-style rifles and his support for rescinding the tax-exempt status for churches and charities that are anti-LGBTQ.\n\n\u201cNo religion and no guns. I think that\u2019s not good,\u201d Trump said.\n\n__\n\nKevin Freking contributed to this report from Washington.", "description": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump tried to turn impeachment rancor into a political rallying cry Thursday, using a Texas rally to bash Democrats as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/655355_election-2020-trump-40573-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-speaks-campaign-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
