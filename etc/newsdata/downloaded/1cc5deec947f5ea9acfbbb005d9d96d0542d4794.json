Francisco, said the new policy was needed to address \u201can unprecedented surge in the number of aliens who enter the country unlawfully across the southern border and, if apprehended, claim asylum and remain in the country while their claims are adjudicated.\u201d\n\nUnder the policy, which was announced July 15, only immigrants who have been denied asylum in another country or who have been victims of \u201csevere\u201d human trafficking are permitted to apply in the United States. \u201cThe rule thus screens out asylum seekers who declined to request protection at the first opportunity,\u201d Mr. Francisco wrote.\n\nUnder the rules, Hondurans and Salvadorans must seek and be denied asylum in Guatemala or Mexico before they can apply in the United States. Guatemalans must seek and be denied asylum in Mexico.\n\nMigrants from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have made up the vast majority of asylum seekers who have tried to enter the United States in record numbers this year. The Border Patrol has arrested 419,831 migrant family members from those three countries at the southwestern border so far this fiscal year, compared with just 4,312 Mexican family members.\n\nThe administration made the unilateral move after months of pushing Guatemala and Mexico to commit to going along with the plan. Mr. Trump went as far as to threaten both countries with tariffs unless they did more to halt the migration.\n\nThe administration struck such a deal with Guatemala in July that would force the country to absorb Central American migrants. But Guatemala\u2019s Constitutional Court has ruled that it needs further approval, and the countries are still working on a plan to carry it out the deal.\n\nThe Mexican government has pushed back against the so-called safe-third-country agreement, which would force it to absorb asylum seekers from Guatemala.", "description": "The policy requires many Central American migrants to seek and be denied asylum in another country before applying in the United States.", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/12/world/00dc-asylum/12Mexico-Migrants-03-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
