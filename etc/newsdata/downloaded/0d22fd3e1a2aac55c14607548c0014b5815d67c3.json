The interactive was built on Facebook\u2019s ReatVR platform and is available on desktop and mobile web on iOS and Android devices.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to use the technology not just to take someone someplace flashy, but to teach them something\u201d, says Chris White, sports director, Courier Journal. \u201cIf you go through the You Be the Ref experience, you\u2019re going to walk away with a better understanding of what a college football referee does and just how difficult a job it can be. We also wanted it to be authentic, and thanks to the great access granted by Western Kentucky University and the insight of college football officiating expert Rogers Redding, we were able to design an experience that captures a bit of what it\u2019s like to be a referee making calls amid the chaos of a college football game.\u201d\n\nThis is the second VR project in collaboration with the Courier Journal. The previous project took viewers inside Kentucky\u2019s Buffalo Trace distillery. You can view that experience here.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2CdN7uw", "description": "USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s Emerging Technology team, in collaboration with the Courier Journal, launched it latest VR experience", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
