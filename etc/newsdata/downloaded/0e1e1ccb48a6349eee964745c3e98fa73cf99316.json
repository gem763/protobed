Her handbag, containing her phone and bank cards, was found on the beach on Thursday but she has not been seen since the event.\n\nConcern was raised on Thursday when Bambridge was not seen at the Nest Beach Club hostel on Koh Rong, where she had stayed and left her passport. She also failed to meet a friend for a scheduled ferry trip.\n\nOn Saturday morning police teams and volunteers searched the island and the surrounding ocean for signs of her. Bambridge\u2019s parents have spoken to British embassy staff and on Saturday were travelling to Cambodia.\n\nAmelia\u2019s sister, Georgie Bambridge, 19, told the Guardian that she spoke to her sibling from the UK shortly before Amelia went to the party. Georgie said that after her backpacking trip Amelia, a former student of Brighton Hove and Sussex sixth form college, planned to train as an English language teacher in Vietnam, where her father works.\n\n\u201cShe was telling me about travelling [and about how] she felt more confident and so much more happy,\u201d Georgie said. \u201cShe was excited about going to this party. She\u2019s officially missing now. The police started involvement in the search party this [Saturday] morning. They\u2019re searching, and they\u2019re searching the sea.\u201d\n\nKoh Rong\u2019s regular Police Beach parties have a reputation for extreme hedonism. One online reviewer wrote that they were known for \u201cfree drug usage with no police, no restrictions\u201d. Another review stated: \u201cSome questionable things always seem to happen at the parties, so visitors should stay aware when they are there just in case.\u201d\n\nRyan Harris, 18, from Worcester, befriended Bambridge in Phnom Penh then travelled with her and other friends to Koh Rong on 19 October. He went to a Police Beach party on the night he arrived on the island.\n\nRyan did not return to Police Beach for the party Bambridge attended on Wednesday, just before she went missing. He said he was in contact with a female friend of Bambridge\u2019s who had been at the event with her.\n\n\u201cShe [the friend] said that the last time she saw Amelia she wasn\u2019t on anything,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was sober, she\u2019d had a few drinks. The last time she saw her she was fine.\u201d\n\nIn 2013 a 55-year-old US tourist named Katherine Grgich was killed on Koh Rong in what police said was an aggravated robbery that escalated to murder. A local man was identified as a suspect but no one has been brought to trial for the death.\n\nHannah Clark, 21, a friend of Bambridge\u2019s, was helping to raise awareness of her disappearance on social media from the UK. She described Bambridge as her \u201cmost reliable friend\u201d, adding that she would be hugely unlikely to break off contact from loved ones voluntarily.\n\nRyan said of Bambridge: \u201cShe\u2019s lovely, a really nice girl. She\u2019s just a normal, outgoing person. She\u2019ll happily chat to anyone. I cut her hair in Phnom Penh \u2013 there were three girls there who\u2019d just moved into our hostel, and she was chatting away for the whole hour.\n\n\u201cThe last time I saw her I said: \u2018I\u2019ll see you in Siem Reap.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Amelia Bambridge, 21, from Sussex, was last seen in early hours of Thursday at beach party on Koh Rong", "authors": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b49354566368f6b126b738601acbb138c42be2b6/214_103_790_474/master/790.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc66173768d7929fe6fdb4d82324306d", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
