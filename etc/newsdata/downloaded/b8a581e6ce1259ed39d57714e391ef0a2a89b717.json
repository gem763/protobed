If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nGifts for athletes can be tricky, particularly for runners. Who'd have thought that a sport that basically only requires sneakers could have so many different accessories to go with it? But fear not\u2014you don\u2019t need to have your favorite runner\u2019s shoe size memorized to buy the perfect runner gift this holiday season.\n\nWe\u2019ve come up with a list of amazing presents\u2014chosen by our on-staff runners, including a certified running coach\u2014for anyone who enjoys logging a few miles on foot, from the couch-to-5Ker to the multiple marathoner. These are the best gifts for runners of 2019, according to Reviewed.\n\n1. For the one who want to record stats: A GPS watch\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Garmin Forerunner 245 and Garmin Forerunner 645 (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser & Jackson Ruckar)\n\nAny runner who graduates from \"occasional jogs\" to \"occasional races\" will appreciate a GPS watch, which puts mileage, pace, and time stats on the wrist in real time and keeps a record of all miles run to allow improvement analysis. The Garmin Forerunners are the best out there, as our testing proves. Our runners deemed the sporty-look Forerunner 245 best of our test for its easy-to-use buttons, large readable screen, and feature-packed tracking. There's even a version that stores music, including offline Spotify playlists, which play over any pair of Bluetooth headphones. The Forerunner 645 packs all the same features in a slimmer, sleeker style that won't look out of place at the office.\n\n2. For the one whose muscles are always tight: The best foam roller\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: LuxFit & TriggerPoint Foam Rollers (Photo: LuxFit & TriggerPoint)\n\nIf you live with a runner, you've probably gotten more of a lesson in muscle anatomy than you expected after high school biology class. Instead of listening to one more complaint about tight hamstrings, IT bands, or piriformis muscles, give our favorite foam roller for easing out those niggling aches. For those with limited space, wrap up the TriggerPoint GRID Foam Roller\u2014same outcome for their muscles, but easier to store.\n\n3. For the one who can't run without music: Sweat-proof workout headphones\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Powerbeats Pro and Mpow Flame Bluetooth Headphones (Photo: Beats & Mpow)\n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Pro are some of the best water-resistant headphones we've tested, with an earhook design that will stay put on anyone's ears even through tough workouts. The Powerbeats Pro are dead-simple to connect to an iPhone, sharing the same wireless chip as Apple's AirPods. For Android users they're also easy to use, and no matter what you get excellent battery life and sound quality, with no wires to worry about.\n\nIf you want a cheaper alternative to the Beats Powerbeats Pro, the MPow Flame earbuds cost less than $20 online and have tons of great reviews. We put them to the test in our labs and found they could play music while submerged under water for 30 minutes. They have a wire that connects the two earbuds together, so they're not truly wireless, but they're an awesome value and a proven performer.\n\n4. For the one who's prone to blisters: A good pair of running socks\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Balega Hidden Comfort Socks (Photo: Balega)\n\nSneakers are only one part of the equation when it comes to comfortable (ahem, blister-free) running. Balega Hidden Comfort socks are faves among runners for great reasons: They're cushioned yet not bulky and they wick sweat quickly, which adds up to a no-chafing experience, no matter how long a run. Plus, they come in all sorts of colors and unisex adult sizes small to XL.\n\nGet the Balega Hidden Comfort Socks on REI for $13\n\n5. For the one who doesn\u2019t leave home without a smartphone: A no-bounce belt\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: SPIbelt Performance Series Water-Resistant Running Belt (Photo: SPIbelt)\n\nThough running phone-free is appealing, sometimes it pays to bring along a smartphone, whether to check directions, text a running buddy en route, or make a call in case of emergency. The SPIbelt Performance Series Running Belt stretches to fit extra-large phones plus keys and is made of water-resistance material to keep contents from getting damp from rain (or from body sweat). Double loops in the band hold gels for easy access during long runs or races. The best part: It will not bounce. The companion water bottles are a nice, secure addition for hydration on the go, too.\n\nGet the SPIbelt Performance Series Water-Resistant Running Belt on Amazon for $25.99\n\n6. For the one who's always squinting: Slip-proof sunnies\n\nBest gifts for runnners 2019: Goodr OG sunglasses (Photo: Goodr)\n\nUnlike regular sunglasses, sports shades have more than one job. They have to dim the sun, reduce glare, and not slide down the nose once things get sweaty. Goodr OG sunglasses do it all, for a great price, in funky colors with even funkier names (pictured here: Sunset \"squishee\" Brain Freeze). Just check with your giftee first to see which ones he or she already owns. (Trust us: You can never have too many Goodrs.)\n\nGet the Goodr OG sunglasses at REI for $25\n\n7. For the one who craves shade: A secure visor\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Headsweats Supervisor Sun Visor (Photo: Headsweats)\n\nIn case you're not yet sensing a theme: Runners like gear that will annoy them the least while they're running. (Because everyone gets irritable at some point during a training cycle.) For that reason, hats aren't everyone's must-have, but for those of us who appreciate a good brim for keeping sun at bay, security is almost as important as comfort. The Headsweats Supervisor Sun Visor ticks both boxes, and comes in a ton of solid colors (ripe for printing with a logo), plus entertaining designs such as the Bigfoot collection and Sugar Skulls.\n\nGet Headsweats Supervisor Sun Visor on Amazon for $12.35 and up\n\n8. For the one who needs a little TLC: Targeted massagers\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: TheraFlow Foot Massager & Zyllion Shiatsu Pillow Massager (Photo: TheraFlow & Zyllion)\n\nBeing a runner comes with that glorious runner\u2019s high, but it also comes with plenty of aches and pains. Instead of shelling out cash for a one-time massage, get the runner in your life a targeted massage tool that keeps on giving. Sore feet, especially those plagued by plantar fasciitis, can benefit from the TheraFlow Foot Massager, which is as gentle or intense as the pressure placed upon it. For larger muscles that require deeper stimulation, look to the Zyllion Shiatsu Pillow Massager with Heat. With these, finally, they\u2019ll stop asking you to rub their (insert sore muscle) \u201cfor just five minutes.\u201d\n\n9. For the one who runs cold: Winter weather accessories\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Smartwool Headband & The North Face Gore CloseFit Fleece Gloves (Photo: Smartwool & The North Face)\n\nAs the hashtag goes, #runnersgottarun, even as temps fall. While the blood is pumping to keep arms and legs flying and the core temperature up, the extremities\u2014particularly the hands and ears\u2014often suffer most. Enter the Smartwool Headband, made of super-soft, sweat-wicking merino wool, which keeps ears toasty without causing the head to overheat, and The North Face Gore CloseFit Fleece Gloves, which are slim-fitting and wind-proof\u2014and tech-compatible for checking a smartphone mid-run.\n\n10. For the one who also needs some zen: The most versatile yoga mat\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Lululemon Yoga Mat (Photo: lululemon)\n\nRunners usually like one thing and one thing only... running. But to reduce the risk of injury and give muscles a much-needed break between runs, yoga is exactly the pace change needed. Your favorite runner can find a flow on our favorite yoga mat. Whether toting it to a studio or turning on some YouTube yoga in the living room, this mat will ensure zero slippage and plenty of cushion.\n\nGet the Lululemon Reversible Mat 5mm at Lululemon for $68\n\n11. For the one who strength-trains: Adjustable dumbbells\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Core Fitness Adjustable Dumbbells (Photo: Core Fitness)\n\nSurprise: To get stronger (and faster) as a runner, it's essential to build muscle, not just pound pavement. There's only so much to gain with small lightweight dumbbells (that is, not much), but investing in a full set of weights is costly and takes up a ton of room. The Core Fitness adjustable dumbbells replace a whole gym, adjusting from 5 to 50 pounds each with the flick of the wrist, and require a tiny fraction of the floor space.\n\nGet the Core Fitness adjustable dumbbells on Amazon for $277\n\n12. For the one whose flexibility could use a tune-up: A stretching strap\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: The Original Stretch Out Strap (Photo: OPTP)\n\nTrue facts: When you can't touch your toes, it's really tough to stretch out the hamstrings, the large muscles that comprise the backs of the thighs that get especially short and kinked up from\u2014you guessed it\u2014running. (Ask your favorite runner to try, but plan to stifle your giggles when there's a foot or more distance from the fingertips to the floor.) This stretch strap fills the gap of, er, too-short arms and creates traction to deepen the stretch. It also comes with a how-to guide for the newbie to flexibility training.\n\nGet the Original Stretch Out Strap on Amazon for $15.95\n\n13. For the one who appreciates multifunctional gear: A headband-slash-neck gaiter\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Buff Multifunctional Headwear (Photo: Buff)\n\nIn warmer weather, a runner needs a sweatband to keep beads of perspiration from flooding into the eyes. Sometimes, a wide headband is handy for keeping hair off the face. And when it's really cold out, a neck gaiter does wonders for retaining warmth, and even covering the lower half of the face to protect against windburn. By gifting the Buff Multifunctional Headwear, your runner recipient gains all three, in any of about a zillion colors and patterns.\n\nGet the Buff Multifunctional Headwear on Amazon for $15.87 and up\n\n14. For the one who goes out at odd hours: Reflective accessories\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Amphipod Xinglet & ReflecToes & Petzl Tikkina (Photo: Amphpod & ReflecToes & Petzl)\n\nWhen days are short and filled with annoying time-sucks like jobs, dedicated runners head out before and after the sun does its thing. This Amphipod reflective vest makes runners highly visible to traffic (and looks less dorky than many), while these clip-on lights make a show of every footfall. If it's really dark out, a simple headlamp can light the way.\n\n15. For the one whose calves complain: Compression legwear\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: 2XU Calf Compression Sleeves & Charmleaks Compression Socks (Photo: 2XU & Charmleaks)\n\nIn case you haven't caught on, there are basically two things runners hold most dear: Getting better at running and not getting injured in the process. The scientific jury is out on whether wearing compression sleeves, like these ones made by 2XU, during a workout aids in performance, but if it feels good, why question it?\n\nCompression for recovery, however, is well researched, as the gentle pressure can improve blood flow, flushing the byproducts of training and bringing oxygen to worn-out muscles. The Charmking socks provide the right amount of tension\u2014and a smile, thanks to their colorful prints.\n\n16. For the one who get cold post-race: Cozy fleece\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Patagonia Better Sweater (Photo: Patagonia)\n\nAnother runner theme worth noting while shopping for gifts: We're very temperature-sensitive. It's cold out, and we work up a sweat. Then we finish and are suddenly very, very cold. When you present the Patagonia Better Sweater Hoodie, suggest your recipient stash it at bag check for post-race warmth. You'll get brownie points for paying attention and all the love when you meet up at the after-party.\n\nGet Patagonia Better Sweater fleece jackets and pullovers at REI for $48.93 and up\n\n17. For the one who is a new parent: A running stroller\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: BOB Rambler Stroller (Photo: BOB Gear)\n\nAn addition to the family doesn't need to spell the end to the new parents' little hobby. Nay, they can raise 'em up right by plopping the baby into a jogging stroller as soon as the pediatrician says the little one has good enough head control (about eight months old). This one from BOB gets great reviews for pavement running, and is a bargain compared to many out there (yes, really).\n\nGet the BOB Rambler Stroller at REI for $360\n\n18. For the one whose only post-run joy is a bath: Relaxing epsom salts\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Dr. Teal's Epsom Salt Muscle Recovery Soak (Photo: Dr. Teal's)\n\nEpsom salts is the layperson's term for magnesium sulfate, a mineral compound known for its soothing and healing effect on muscles. This formula, from Dr. Teal's, adds in arnica, a homeopathic pain reliever, and fragrant eucalyptus and menthol, which will assure your giftee that it's working from first whiff.\n\nGet Dr. Teal's Epsom Salt Muscle Recovery Soak (3-pack) on Amazon for $23.47\n\n19. For the one who thinks running is an art form: A print of a favorite race\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: RunInk course maps (Photo: RunInk)\n\nYes, running can be an art form in itself\u2014especially if you take course maps and frame them on the wall. Run Ink reimagines popular race routes in the US and around the world as colorful graphics. So the next time your runner friend is bragging about about a race, he or she will have a compelling visual aid. Run Ink sells cute coordinating coffee mugs, too.\n\nGet a Run Ink Course Map Race Print on Amazon for $17.99 and up\n\n20. For the one you know a bit too well: Anti-chafing balm\n\nBest gifts for runners 2019: Body Glide (Photo: Body Glide)\n\nThere's something to be said about your relationship to a runner if you know that he or she would benefit from Body Glide. While running isn\u2019t a contact sport with other people, it can be one with your own two legs, or between your shirt and your skin (if you don't know, don't ask). With a deodorant-shaped stick of Body Glide, your favorite runner can say farewell to chafing, and you can say goodbye to listening to them complain about it.\n\nGet Body Glide on REI for $5 and up\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.
