He's a complicated character. I don't think I could ever play a real hero \u2013 there's always got to be something a little bit wrong. I think it's because one of my eyes is smaller than the other one.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe added of taking the role: \"I love the director, Matt Reeves, and it's a dope character. His morality is a little bit off.\n\n\"He's not the golden boy, unlike almost every other comic book character. There is a simplicity to his worldview, but where it sits is strange, which allows you to have more scope with the character.\"\n\nNaturally, fans will always have strong views on how the Dark Knight is portrayed, and Pattinson is aware of this.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nPattinson explained: \"I just fear that when I say anything about 'Batman', people online are like, 'What does this mean?' And I don't know!\n\n\"I used to be very good at censoring myself, but I've said so many ridiculous things over the years, so I'm always curious when I'm promoting these movies how many times I can mess up.\n\n\"It feels like with every movie that comes out, there's always one quote from me where it's like, 'How? What kind of out-of-body experience produced that screaming nonsense?'\"\n\nWe get you, Robert!\n\nThe Batman is released in cinemas on June 25, 2019.\n\nDo you agree with Robert Pattinson's remarks about Batman?
