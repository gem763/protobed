Then the group took another hit Thursday after Carnival Corp., the world's biggest cruise operator, cut its profit forecast for the year.\n\nCarnival shares slumped 8.5%, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. fell 3.8% and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. lost 2.5%.\n\nAt this point, have investors' concerns about the group gotten overblown?\n\nUBS analysts think that could be the case. The cruise business still looks healthy and the outlook for future bookings is strong, UBS said in a research note earlier this month.\n\nThat seemed to be reflected in Carnival's results: though the firm had to trim its earnings forecast, that move appeared to be primarily driven by the recent spike in fuel prices caused by attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities. All told, Carnival still managed to deliver better-than-expected results and a nearly 12% jump in revenue from the year earlier.\n\nMore broadly, UBS says cruise operators have managed to improve their fuel efficiency -- and that trend is likely to persist as firms replace older, less efficient ships with newer models equipped with better technology.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's Celebrity Edge ship, for instance, is 25% more fuel efficient than its predecessor, while Carnival has said its AIDA Nova ship is 25% to 35% more fuel efficient than the rest of its fleet, according to UBS.\n\nThe bad news? None of that matters if the global economy softens faster than expected and consumers pull back on discretionary spending. That would hurt cruise operators, which, unlike businesses like electric utilities and grocery stores, are highly sensitive to changes in the economic cycle.\n\nWatch to see if investors' recent preference for cheaper stocks ends up outweighing their worries about the global economy.\n\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 16:32 ET (20:32 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
