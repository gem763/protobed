During Hurricane Irma in 2017, that's what dried out areas of the shoreline in Florida that are normally submerged, leaving some manatees stranded.\n\nManatee stranded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Irma?src=hash\">#Irma</a> People coming to the rescue when the waters receded in Sarasota. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ActionNewsJax\">@ActionNewsJax</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HurrcaneIrma?src=hash\">#HurrcaneIrma</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/UTcUiH3wl3\">pic.twitter.com/UTcUiH3wl3</a> \u2014@PaigeANjax\n\nThey were also an odd sight for residents used to water levels that don't deviate very much when the tide goes in or out,\n\n\"It's wind pushing that water away,\" Fogarty said. \"When wind is blowing off shore, you don't have the big waves at the beach because the wind is in the opposite direction.\"\n\nOn a smaller scale, Fogarty said you could watch how water in a puddle reacts to winds. Wind creates ripples based on the direction of the wind, which is essentially what happens in storm surge.\n\n\"It's all about wind direction,\" he said.\n\n\"The strong wind shift blowing from one direction and then in the total opposite direction after the eye goes through ... pushes that same water right back in quite quickly behind the eye of the storm.\"\n\nThe water often returns very quickly. After a negative surge from Irma, more than 1.5 metres of water returned to one coast in less than an hour, he said.\n\n\"If you see water get drawn out, it doesn't mean to go out and explore,\" Fogarty said. \"It means something weird's going on. You don't want to be caught with the water coming back in.\"", "description": "After submerging the Bahamas up to its rooftops and killing five people, Hurricane Dorian is expected to generate \u201clife-threatening\u201d storm surge along the coasts of three U.S. states.
