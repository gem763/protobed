The power to enter into such agreements is reserved to the federal government, which must be able to speak with one voice in the area of U.S. foreign policy,\u201d DOJ said in a release. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s unlawful cap-and-trade agreement with Quebec undermines the president\u2019s ability to negotiate competitive agreements with other nations, as the President sees fit.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Justice did not respond to request for comment, but environmental groups were quick to defend the legality of the state\u2019s emissions program.\n\n\u201cCalifornia and Quebec are modeling an innovative, legally and environmentally robust program that cuts pollution and delivers economic incentives for cleaner energy, fuels and business practices,\u201d the Environmental Defense Fund wrote in a statement.\n\n\"The administration is yet again not only tearing down critical health protections and safeguards, but is going after others who seek to uphold or extend them.\u201d\n\nThe suit is just the latest move in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and California.\n\nRecently President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE tweeted he would revoke a California waiver that allows the state to set tougher tailpipe emissions standards, which in turn have been adopted by more than a dozen other states.\n\nOther actions from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have aimed to smear California\u2019s environmental record, threatening to withhold California\u2019s highway funds by hitting the state for violating air quality standards along with a dubious claim the state\u2019s homeless population was affecting water quality.\n\nCalifornia has previously argued it needs environmental regulations that go after transportation pollution in order to meet air quality standards.\n\n\u201cThe standards that we are now in the process of enforcing are necessary to protect the public health and welfare, not just because we care about the future of the planet or polar bears, it's because we actually need these extra clean cars in order to meet the health standards that are set by the federal government that we violate now on a very regular basis throughout Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley,\" California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols said in September as the state prepared court action to fight the revocation of its waiver.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s cap-and-trade program on transportation emissions has served as a model as multiple New England and mid-Atlantic states embark on a similar regional approach for transportation pollution.", "description": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) is trying to put an end to a California program that caps carbon emissions from the transportation sector, arguing the state exceeded its authority by crafting the program alongside C", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/california_auto_emissions_09032019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
