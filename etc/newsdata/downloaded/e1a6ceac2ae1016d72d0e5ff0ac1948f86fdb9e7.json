He was awarded up to \u00a31.5m worth of stock \u2013 238,000 shares \u2013 in a long\u2013term share plan that will become available in 2022 if he meets certain targets.\n\nBoyes was given a \u00a3287,000 bonus and a long\u2013term share plan worth \u00a31.2m, while White pocketed \u00a3203,000 from the bonus and was handed another \u00a3859,000 under the 2022 scheme.\n\nRBC Capital Markets analysts gave Ladbrokes Coral-owner GVC their stamp of approval as they started coverage of the UK gambling sector.\n\nGVC was named RBC's top pick and given an 'outperform' rating, with brokers praising its 'excellent track record' of assimilating acquired firms into the group.\n\nIt didn't help shares, though, as they fell 0.9 per cent, or 7.6p, to 870p.\n\nFlutter Entertainment's merger with The Stars Group was dubbed 'an unparalleled revenue opportunity', but analysts are holding back slightly until the deal is completed.\n\nBut RBC brokers put William Hill on the naughty step for 'lagging' in an industry 'where scale matters' and lots of other companies have combined to protect themselves. Flutter \u2013 also rated 'outperform' \u2013 lost 0.5 per cent, or 38p, ending at 7746p, while William Hill \u2013 deemed 'sector perform' \u2013 slid 0.7 per cent, or 1.4p, to 200.1p.\n\nThe FTSE 100 edged up 0.09 per cent, or 6.81 points, to 7331.28, as the market seemed to have largely priced in the EU granting the UK a Brexit extension.\n\nThe FTSE 250 rose 0.53 per cent, or 106.65 points, to 20210.16.\n\nSirius Minerals started the week on the right foot, with its shares lifting 3 per cent, or 0.09p, to 3.07p.\n\nInvestor forums were awash with hopeful chatter that later this week the potash miner could offer an update on its strategic review.\n\nBoss Chris Fraser previously said the outcome could be pinned down by the end of October.\n\nFertiliser miner Emmerson rallied after it announced its Khemisset project in Morocco has 72 per cent more potash in it than the firm previously thought, or around 537m tons. The company's shares closed 1.3 per cent, or 0.05p, higher, at 3.9p.", "description": "Analysts think the troubled luxury car maker will cut its 2019 outlook again and believe the company had a 'very weak' third quarter.
