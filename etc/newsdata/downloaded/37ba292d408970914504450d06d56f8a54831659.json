While I haven\u2019t had the time to extensively test out every new feature in the sweeping new update, some updates stuck out immediately as clear improvements.\n\nIn this update, Apple focused on privacy, on performance, and on improving core apps like Photos, Maps, and Messages. I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised to find that those tweaks make my phone a little better and more useful: The new design of the Photos app makes it more usable, so you can quickly find the photo you\u2019re looking for. I also found some useful updates in the Messages app and in the App Store.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s how to download iOS 13, Apple\u2019s big new iPhone update\n\nFinally, I\u2019m optimistic about Shortcuts, the Apple-made app for helping automate common tasks on your phone. It comes built-in to iOS 13 (before, it was a separate download), and suggests some helpful uses based on your habits. I\u2019ve already used some of those routines several times.\n\nThe actual usefulness of these changes will become more clear over time, but here are some of my first impressions after a day with iOS 13:\n\nMessages got an update with some features that are already proving useful in the day I\u2019ve had iOS 13.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nI frequently go back in a message thread to try and find something I saved for later. In iOS 13, you can see photos and links separately under \u201cinfo,\u201d eliminating the need to scroll up. I can already tell this will save me time and frustration.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nIt\u2019s also easier to manage and delete messages (something I should do more frequently to clear up space on my phone). Instead of swiping to delete individual threads, there\u2019s now a button that will allow you to \u201cManage Messages List\u201d and delete multiple threads at once in one go.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nI\u2019ll always happily take more Memoji options. Memoji are Apple\u2019s custom-made emoji that use the iPhone\u2019s front camera to track and match your facial expression \u2014 only available on the iPhone X and newer models.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nYour options to share a message look a little different from before. The new design isn\u2019t exactly worse, but moving AirDrop down next to Messages means I\u2019ve almost accidentally airdropped several random links to people on the train while trying to send them to my sister. The muscle memory is hard to unlearn.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nA minor App Store change is already proving helpful. Now, you can delete apps straight from the same screen where you see all your pending app updates. That\u2019s handy, as seemingly every single app updates to support iOS 13 \u2014 I\u2019ve seen a lot of apps that I\u2019ve forgotten about, and that can now be deleted.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nIn the same spirit of decluttering my phone, I\u2019m excited about the ability to automatically close tabs after certain periods in the Safari browser. I\u2019m embarrassed to say how many were actually open when I went to test this feature.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nI\u2019m finally admitting to myself I\u2019ll never read the article I opened in March.\n\nAs a devotee of Twitter dark mode, I was excited to finally have the feature for my iPhone. Right now, I\u2019m trying out the \u201cLight Until Sunset,\u201d feature, letting my phone automatically switch between light and dark.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nTyping by swiping across the keyboard is one of my favorite new features. I previously used Gboard to enable this feature, but occasionally updates would break it and I\u2019d have to re-add the keyboard manually. Having the swipe built into keyboards makes it effortless to use.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nYou can toggle this setting on and off under Settings, then General, then Keyboard, and scroll to the bottom.\n\nSo far, the Photos redesign has made it easier for me to find pictures and sort through old photos.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nI\u2019m not sure how I feel about the photos feed hiding screenshots yet. It does make my albums look cleaner, but it takes an extra second to find a screenshot when that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. Hiding duplicates is a handy feature, though.\n\nSome new shortcuts look promising, although I haven\u2019t gotten to try them all out.\n\nsource Mary Meisenzahl\n\nI can already tell that this shortcut that combines screenshots for easier sharing is going to get used all the time.\n\nAfter a short time using the update, my advice is to download iOS 13 now, no need to wait for iOS 13.1. I haven\u2019t noticed any major bugs, and the system is certainly usable as-is. Playing with the cool new features \u2014 especially those updates to Photos and Messages \u2014 is worth any minor risks of bugginess, in my opinion.", "description": "Business Insider - I used iOS 13, Apple's newest iPhone update, for the past 24 hours, and here are some reasons why you should download the update..
