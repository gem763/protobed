Central Park Tower is now the tallest residential tower in New York City \u2014 and the world.\n\nAnother Billionaire's Row skyscraper, 111 West 57th Street, reached its full height of 1,428 feet in April 2019, bumping 432 Park Avenue down to fourth place.\n\nSome buildings on the list were completed years ago, while others only recently reached their full height and are still being finished.\n\nThese giants may not hold their current spots in the ranking for much longer, however. In Midtown and elsewhere in Manhattan, supertall skyscrapers are sprouting up every day that will join the ranks of the city's tallest (and the world's) within the next few years.\n\nOne Vanderbilt on 42nd Street is expected to be finished in 2021, at which point it will become the fourth-tallest tower in the city at 1,401 feet. And in Lower Manhattan, 45 Broad Street will take over ninth place when it's completed in 2021.\n\nFor now, here are the 11 tallest buildings in the city, from the New York Times Tower to the One World Trade Center.", "description": "The Empire State Building was once the world's tallest building.
