The flu, on the other hand, can strike suddenly and symptoms are also usually more severe and last considerably longer.\n\nWhat is the common cold and what are the symptoms?\n\nUnless you\u2019re a supernatural being, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve had the common cold at least once in your lifetime. Some unlucky folk get it every year.\n\nIt\u2019s thought that more than 200 different viruses can cause the common cold, but according to the Mayo Clinic \u2018rhinoviruses are the most common culprit\u2019.\n\nCommon colds also very easy to catch, as the virus can spread via the air or direct contact with someone else who has it (and by sharing items that they use).\n\nThere are a number of different symptoms that can signal a common cold.\n\nAn initial sore throat can be an indicator, followed by a runny nose or nasal congestion, as well as a cough by day four or five. An individual may also experience a mild fever \u2013 but this is more common in children, rather than adults.\n\nMuscle aches, headaches and a loss in taste or smell can also occur.\n\nBasically if you\u2019re feeling run down over winter, it\u2019s likely you have a cold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPay the doctor a visit if you get a high fever and if the fever lasts longer than five days, or if you find yourself short of breath.\n\nAdditionally, the NHS recommends to see your GP if the cold lasts longer than three weeks.\n\nWhat is the flu and what are the symptoms?\n\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned, flu symptoms are very similar to those of a cold, but come on much faster.\n\nIf you have a cold, you can usually get up and carry on with your everyday routine \u2013 despite feeling awful \u2013 but those with the flu are so exhausted that they are often unable to get out of bed. Headaches and achy muscles also tend to be much worse.\n\nAdditional symptoms can include an upset stomach and nausea, as well as a fever. If you have the flu, your body temperature will usually be 38C or above.\n\nCertain people are at a higher risk of getting flu complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis and sinus infections, which can lead to hospitalisation. Some cases can tragically result in death.\n\nFor this reason, it\u2019s important to know if you\u2019re in a high-risk group, such as adults aged 65 and over, pregnant women, young children, people with asthma, people who are HIV-positive, people with cancer, people with diabetes and children with neurological conditions.\n\nHow to prevent yourself from getting a cold or the flu\n\nWhen it comes to the common cold, there\u2019s one word that goes a very long way: hygiene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose and can spread through water droplets in the air when a person talks, coughs or blows their nose.\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t help it if someone sneezes in front of you on the bus, but staying as hygienic as possible can pay off.\n\nIf you take public transport to work , be sure to wash your hands in warm soapy water after your journey or keep a hand sanitiser close by. The same goes if you work in an office.\n\nYou should also avoid sharing cutlery, drinks and towels with anyone who is likely to have an infection.\n\nIf you have the early stages of a cold, be sure to discard any used tissues to prevent contamination, and if you\u2019re at high risk of developing the flu, get a vaccine jab for free at the NHS. The jab offers greater protection from various strains of the flu.\n\nShould you get ill, do your best to rest and avoid going into work (so you don\u2019t spread the virus).\n\nMORE: Who is eligible for the flu jab, what are the side-effects and where to get vaccinated?\n\nMORE: Why you should get the flu vaccine even if you\u2019re young and healthy\n\nMORE: How to prepare your plants for cold weather\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cold and flu season has arrived, so here's everything you need to know about telling the two infections apart.", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90500248_1571417098.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
