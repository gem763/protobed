This is a major effort that is continuing,\u201d the official told reporters.\n\nForeign ministers will meet in Washington on Nov. 14 to discuss the mission.\n\nTrump has softened his pullout plans for Syria after a backlash from Congress, including fellow Republicans, who say he enabled a long-threatened Turkish incursion on Oct. 9 against Kurdish forces in Syria who had been America\u2019s top allies in the battle against Islamic State since 2014.\n\nU.S. special forces carried out the Syrian operation in which Baghdadi killed himself and three of his children by detonating a suicide vest when he was cornered in a tunnel.\n\nTrump said on Monday he may declassify and release part of the video taken on Saturday of the raid. The video is believed to include aerial footage and possibly footage from cameras mounted on the soldiers who stormed Baghdadi\u2019s compound.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about it. We may,\u201d Trump told reporters before flying to Chicago. \u201cWe may take certain parts of it and release it.\u201d\n\nTrump said on Sunday that Baghdadi had died \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d in a raid that fulfilled his top national security goal.\n\n\u201cLONE WOLF\u201d THREAT\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to say if the United States had told Russia about the operation in advance.\n\nBut he added: \u201cIf this information is confirmed we can talk about a serious contribution by the president of the United States to the fight against international terrorism.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Baghdadi\u2019s death was a major blow against Islamic State but \u201cthe fight continues to finally defeat this terrorist organization\u201d.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \u201cWe will work with our coalition partners to bring an end to the murderous, barbaric activities of Daesh (Islamic State) once and for all.\u201d\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters: \u201cThis is a many-headed monster ... As you cut one off, another one inevitably arises.\u201d\n\nIn Southeast Asia, an important focus for Islamic State, officials said security forces were preparing for a long battle to thwart the group\u2019s ideology.\n\nThe Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, home to some of Asia\u2019s most organized Islamist militants, said they were braced for retaliation by Islamic State loyalists, including \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks by radicalized locals.\n\nCAPABLE AND DANGEROUS\n\nThough Baghdadi\u2019s death will unsettle Islamic State, it remains capable and dangerous, said Delfin Lorenzana, defense secretary of the Philippines, where the group\u2019s influence has taken a hold in its troubled Mindanao region.\n\n\u201cThis is a blow to the organization considering al-Baghdadi\u2019s stature as a leader. But this is just a momentary setback considering the depth and reach of the organization worldwide,\u201d Lorenzana said. \u201cSomebody will take his place.\u201d\n\nIslamic State has no declared successor as leader. But the group has in the past proved resilient, continuing to mount or inspire attacks in the region and beyond despite losing most of its territory in recent years.\n\nBaghdadi had long been sought by the United States - which offered a $25 million reward - as leader of a jihadist group that at one point controlled large areas of Syria and Iraq, where it declared a caliphate.\n\nIslamic State has brutally attacked religious minorities and launched deadly strikes on five continents in a violent campaign that horrified most Muslims.\n\nIn their long hunt for Baghdadi, Iraqi intelligence teams secured a break in February 2018 after one of his top aides gave them information on how he escaped capture for so many years, two Iraqi security officials said.\n\nBaghdadi held strategy talks with his commanders in moving minibuses packed with vegetables in order to avoid detection, Ismael al-Ethawi told officials after he was arrested by Turkish authorities and handed to the Iraqis.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has made what would be his first public appearance at a mosque in the centre of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014, in this still image taken from video. Social Media Website via Reuters TV/File Photo\n\n\u201cEthawi gave valuable information which helped the Iraqi multi-security agencies team complete the missing pieces of the puzzle of Baghdadi\u2019s movements and places he used to hide,\u201d one of the Iraqi security officials said.\n\nIraqi security officials said Kurdish intelligence agents had exchanged information with counterparts in Baghdad on the movements of Baghdadi and his aides in Syria. One of the Kurds\u2019 sources passed on a \u201cgolden tip\u201d earlier this year.\n\nSuspicious movements were spotted by locals at a house in a village in Syria, which was placed under surveillance and turned out to be the house used by Baghdadi, the Iraqi officials said.\n\nU.S. PULLBACK\n\nThe raid on Baghdadi comes weeks after Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria.\n\nCritics expressed concern at the abandoning of the Kurdish fighters who were instrumental in defeating Islamic State in Syria, and said the move might allow the group to regain strength and pose a threat to U.S. interests.\n\nTrump said the raid would not change his decision to withdraw troops from Syria.\n\nBut killing Baghdadi could help blunt those concerns, as well as boosting Trump domestically at a time when he is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nEgypt, which is fighting militants loyal to Islamic State, said the killing of Baghdadi is \u201can important step towards eradicating terrorism\u201d.\n\nU.S. foe Iran, which accuses the United States and its allies of creating Islamic State, was dismissive. Information Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, tweeted: \u201cNot a big deal, You just killed your creature\u201d.\n\nNIGHT-TIME RAID\n\nIn the hours before Trump\u2019s announcement, sources in the region had described the raid on a compound in the village of Barisha, in Idlib province bordering Turkey, in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nTrump said eight helicopters carried U.S. special forces to Baghdadi\u2019s compound, where they were met with gunfire before blasting their way in.\n\nThe president said he watched the operation in the Situation Room of the White House.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters prior to boarding Air Force One and departing Washington for travel to Chicago at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, U.S., October 28, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nAt the height of its power, Islamic State ruled over millions of people from northern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad.\n\nThousands of civilians were killed by the group as it mounted what the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against Iraq\u2019s Yazidi minority. It also caused worldwide revulsion by beheading foreign nationals from countries including the United States, Britain and Japan.\n\nThe group has claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\n(Graphic: The hunt for Baghdadi, here)", "description": "The United States wants to bolster a coalition fighting Islamic State in northeastern Syria, a senior State Department official said on Monday, after the leader of the jihadi movement, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a weekend operation.", "authors": ["Humeyra Pamuk", "Andrew Osborn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445973184&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R102", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
