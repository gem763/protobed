She made the application identifying herself as an Irish citizen. The Home Office rejected the application on the grounds that it considered DeSouza a British citizen, and said the only way it could deal with the case was for her to \u201crenounce her status as a British citizen\u201d.\n\nHowever, a first-tier immigration and asylum tribunal ruled in her favour in February last year, saying that under the terms of the Good Friday agreement people of Northern Ireland had a unique right to identify in multiple ways.\n\nThe Home Office challenged the ruling, arguing that not all the contents of the agreement had been incorporated into British law and therefore the rights in the Good Friday agreement did not trump those in the 1981 British Nationality Act.\n\nThe Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said Ireland had amended its domestic law after the 1998 peace deal to deliver the agreed rights. Questions will now be asked as to why UK domestic law was not amended likewise.\n\nIn its appeal on 10 September, Tony McGlennan QC, for the Home Office, argued the initial tribunal had made a \u201cfundamental and egregious error\u201d.\n\nDeSouza had held British citizenship since birth \u201cso she is not exercising treaty rights\u201d and therefore did not fit into the category of being an EEA national.\n\nThe high court in Belfast ruled in favour of the Home Office on Monday.", "description": "Citizenship case raises questions over why UK law has not incorporated Good Friday rights", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Emma Desouza"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6622375ba25418e9a5b487be839d4f428fba637f/0_489_2333_1399/master/2333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b2cd3c9101dcd215225f7f571214c4f2", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
