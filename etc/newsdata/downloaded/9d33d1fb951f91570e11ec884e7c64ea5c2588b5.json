Mandel Ngan/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nSpeaking to the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, also denied that he ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives nearly a year ago, but said he ultimately bears \u201cfull responsibility\u201d as the leader of his country.\n\nWhile Khashoggi\u2019s death sparked a global uproar and tarnished the crown prince\u2019s reputation, the Trump administration\u2019s tense standoff with Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s arch-foe, has more recently dominated U.S. policy toward Riyadh, especially after the Sept. 14 attacks on the heartland of the Saudi oil industry.\n\n\u201cIf the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests,\u201d the crown prince said. \u201cOil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven\u2019t seen in our lifetimes.\u201d\n\nThe crown prince, in an interview conducted on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, said he agreed with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the Sept. 14 attacks, which damaged the world\u2019s biggest petroleum-processing facility and knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply, were an act of war by Iran.\n\nBut he said he preferred a peaceful resolution because a war between Saudi Arabia and Iran would collapse the global economy.\n\nThe United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia have blamed the attacks on Iran. Tehran has denied any involvement. Instead, the Iran-aligned Yemeni Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe political and peaceful solution is much better than the military one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe crown prince also said U.S. President Donald Trump should meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to craft a new deal on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program and influence across the Middle East.\n\nEfforts to bring the two together last week at the United Nations General Assembly failed. Tensions between Washington and Tehran have escalated over the U.S. withdrawal from an Iranian nuclear deal and its reinstatement of sanctions against Tehran.\n\n\u2018ABSOLUTELY NOT\u2019\n\nDays before the anniversary of the killing of Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Turkey, the crown prince said: \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d when asked if he ordered the murder.\n\nBut he said he took full responsibility for the killing, \u201csince it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a mistake. And I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future,\u201d the crown prince said of the killing, which he called \u201cheinous.\u201d\n\nThe CIA and some Western governments have said they believe he ordered it, but Saudi officials have repeatedly said he had no role.\n\nAfter initial denials, the official Saudi narrative blamed the murder on rogue operatives. The public prosecutor said the then-deputy intelligence chief ordered the repatriation of Khashoggi, a royal insider who became an outspoken critic, but the lead negotiator ordered him killed after discussions for his return failed.\n\nAsked how the killing could have happened without him knowing about it,\u201d the crown prince said: \u201cSome think that I should know what 3 million people working for the Saudi government do daily? It\u2019s impossible that the 3 million would send their daily reports to the leader or the second highest person in the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that \u201cthe investigations are being carried out, and once charges are proven against someone, regardless of their rank, it will be taken to court, no exception made.\u201d\n\nEleven Saudi suspects have been put on trial in secretive proceedings but only a few hearings have been held. A U.N. report has called for Prince Mohammed and other senior Saudi officials to be investigated.\n\nKhashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, where he was to receive papers ahead of his wedding. His body was dismembered and removed from the building, according to reports, and his remains have not been found.\n\nAsked about criticism of the Saudis in the U.S. Congress over the Khashoggi killing and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, which has taken a huge civilian toll, the crown prince said: \u201cThe (U.S.-Saudi) relationship is much larger than that.\u201d\n\nTrump has resisted congressional efforts to block U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe crown prince also repeated a Saudi call for Iran to halt its support for Houthi forces in Yemen and said he was open to \u201call initiatives for a political solution\u201d to end the war there.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince warned in an interview broadcast on Sunday that oil prices could spike to \"unimaginably high numbers\" if the world does not come together to deter Iran, but said he would prefer a political solution to a military one.", "authors": ["Matt Spetalnick", "Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435333365&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0WB-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
