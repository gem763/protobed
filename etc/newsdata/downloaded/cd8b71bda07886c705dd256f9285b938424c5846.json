DeSantis \u2014 and Florida \u2014 in the storm spotlight\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Hurricane Dorian\u2019s looming threat poses a familiar test for Florida\u2019s nascent Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, who touted his connection to President Donald Trump as a reason for Floridians to vote for him last fall.\n\nDealing with the complexities \u2013 and politics - of natural disasters has enhanced the reputations of previous Florida governors, including Jeb Bush and Rick Scott. And even though Dorian\u2019s track is ticking east, which could spare Florida from a direct hit this week, the storm has required DeSantis to test-drive his administration\u2019s emergency management capabilities amid the threat of widespread power outages, flooding and fatalities.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDeSantis so far is handling his first major appearance in the hurricane spotlight, a rite of passage for Florida governors, well. As the Category 4 storm approaches Florida\u2019s east coast, the political stakes are high for the new governor.\n\n\u201cThere is a stage being built by this natural disaster, just like a stage for a political rally,\u201d said David Johnson, a Republican political consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s often not of your own building, but you can determine how people feel. Even if they disagree with you on policy issues\u2026they can like you because they trust you.\u201d\n\nDeSantis\u2019 approval rating is near 60 percent eight months after taking office, making him one of the most popular governors in the country. It\u2019s an enviable position, but things can change quickly at the well-traveled intersection of natural disasters and politics.\n\nAs Dorian threatened Friday, DeSantis brushed aside talk of political consequences.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view it politically at all, we\u2019re trying to protect the state, protect people,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nAs he prepares for the storm\u2019s impact, one of the governor\u2019s biggest allies is the president.\n\nTrump played a big role in DeSantis\u2019 surprise 2018 GOP primary victory, and the two remain close. DeSantis and Trump have spoken several times this week as the storm approached.\n\nThe Trump administration has approved an emergency fuel waiver for Florida, signed off on federal assistance and green-lighted an emergency order authorizing FEMA to provide equipment and other resources.\n\nFlorida\u2019s governor can\u2019t control the weather. But he does play a pivotal role in how the state gears up and responds to the threat, and can be blamed if something goes wrong.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma nearly two years ago, 12 nursing home patients died after the power was knocked out and the temperature in the home began to rise. Four employees of the home were arrested this past week after a two-year investigation.\n\nAn attorney for one of the employees said administrators repeatedly called Scott\u2019s personal cell phone for help but never got a response. Scott, in a statement last week, said nursing home administrators should have called 911.\n\nScott later pushed for rules requiring nursing homes to have backup generators or power sources, but more than half of the homes in the state have not fully implemented that mandate.\n\nThe DeSantis administration has made some tweaks to emergency preparation, while keeping intact some policies that drew fire under Scott.\n\nDeSantis has maintained a policy that would keep major roadways open in two directions. Millions evacuated ahead of Irma in 2017, leading to massive traffic jams and calls for one-way flow of highways. Instead, state officials this week are calling on motorists to use highway shoulders in case of evacuations.\n\nBush\u2019s handling of storms also offers a glimpse at the high-stakes political implications of hurricanes. In September 2004, the Bush administration dealt with hurricanes Charley, Ivan, Frances, and Jeanne.\n\nIn the heat of a presidential race that featured Bush\u2019s brother, George W. Bush, the president and the governor took high-profile tours of storm damage. Jeb Bush was seen as ably handling the hurricane mess, which helped his brother.\n\n\u201cGeorge W. Bush may not have won Florida in 2004 if Jeb hadn\u2019t handled the hurricanes so adeptly,\u201d said Mike Grissom, former executive director of the Republican Party of Florida in 2012, when Hurricane Isaac threatened the Republican National Convention in Tampa.\n\nJeb Bush, who guided the state through eight hurricanes over two years, said he made a major miscalculation in 1999 when he pushed for a hastily-arranged evacuation in northeast Florida as Hurricane Floyd threatened, only to watch the storm run parallel along the east coast before making landfall in North Carolina.\n\nDuring Hurricane Charley, Bush was in the middle of a press conference when advisors alerted him that he needed to halt evacuations and tell people to stay where they were, because the storm had suddenly altered its path.\n\n\u201cWhen we were really successful, a lot of people are able to take credit,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t work as well, you have to accept responsibility, even though you might have been marginally involved.\u201d\n\nHe said Florida\u2019s emergency teams have a \u201cculture and traditions of excellence\u201d that have remained in place no matter who is governor. \u201cIt\u2019s the one place where government works really well at all levels,\u201d Bush said.\n\nHe didn\u2019t consider the political consequences when dealing with storms, but, he said, took full responsibility.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame others, don\u2019t blame Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nAlan Levine, who led the Agency for Health Care Administration during the George W. Bush administration, said political outcomes can result from a governor\u2019s performance, but put it another way.\n\n\u201cWe never thought of it in terms of politics,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother word for politics is accountability.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf things are not handled well, they are held accountable,\u201d he said, \u201csometimes at the ballot box.\u201d", "description": "'There is a stage being built by this natural disaster, just like a stage for a political rally'", "authors": ["Gary Fineout", "Matt Dixon"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/99/e2/2f9d05ef423eb44a5095416aad87/webp.net-resizeimage.jpg"}
