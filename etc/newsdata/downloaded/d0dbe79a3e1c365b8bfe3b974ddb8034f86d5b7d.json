He has been placed in the league\u2019s protocol for head injuries.\n\nThe 27-year-old Randall, who is in his second season with Cleveland, missed practice earlier in the week with what coach Freddie Kitchens said was a stomach virus.\n\nEric Murray is listed as Randall\u2019s backup on the depth chart and will likely replace him against the Jets. Randall had been looking forward to the game and a chance to face former Browns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams. The two did not see eye to eye during their one season together.\n\nThe Browns also said defensive end Chris Smith returned to practice following the tragic death of his girlfriend, Petara Cordero. She was stuck by a car Wednesday morning while standing next to Smith\u2019s vehicle after a tire malfunction.\n\nCordero recently gave birth to the couple\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe 47-year-old woman who hit Cordero told Cleveland police she had been drinking. The incident is still under investigation.\n\nSmith practiced Saturday, but it hasn\u2019t been determined if he\u2019ll play in New York. He\u2019s listed as questionable on the injury report. One of the team\u2019s most popular players, Smith didn\u2019t play in last week\u2019s loss to Tennessee.\n\nLinebacker Adarius Taylor will miss the game with an ankle injury and rookie Mack Wilson will take his spot in the Browns\u2019 base defense.\n\nStarting left guard Joel Bitonio (abdomen), wide receiver Rashard Higgins (knee), and backup quarterback Drew Stanton (knee) are also questionable.\n\nIf Stanton is inactive, Garrett Gilbert will be behind Baker Mayfield.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Browns starting safety Damarious Randall will miss Monday night's game against the New York Jets with a concussion.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/browns_coping_football_51498_c0-179-4290-2680_s1770x1032.jpg?86eb9b766d128f2baf027b87f0f4941a1ff9104e", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
