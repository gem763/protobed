So why is President Trump so cheerful?\n\n\u201cWe just got great news from California, a judge ruled for us,\u201d he said, referring to a decision blocking a state law that aimed at keeping Trump off the ballot unless he made his tax returns public.\n\nThe president said a \u201cbreaking news\u201d alert had \u201cme holding my breath because I know it\u2019s going to be about me. They\u2019re always about me.\u201d We both laughed.\n\nThat was the start of my Tuesday night phone interview. It was 10 p.m. and the president, who sees sleep as a waste of time, seemed very energized despite the relentless onslaught and long days. He admitted he was feeling good, joking that \u201cit must be a personality defect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds strange to say I\u2019m energized, but I love it, I love it,\u201d he said of the daily combat with Democrats and the media. \u201cThese people are so corrupt. They\u2019re cons, all they want to do is win the election.\u201d\n\nI had called him because I wanted to know whether he and his team were prepared for the daily barrage of accusations coming from Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Adam Schiff and others. I pointed out that whatever Pelosi\u2019s initial hesitancy, she is now all-in on impeachment and attacks are also aimed at Attorney General Bill Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIs the president setting up a war room to defend himself and his aides for the hot battles ahead?\n\n\u201cNo, no war room,\u201d Trump said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve got very good people, good lawyers, good White House counsel.\u201d\n\nHe said the issue first came up \u201cwhen the idiot governor from California, you can quote me, sued me over the tax returns, and people asked about a war room then. We didn\u2019t need one.\u201d\n\nHe also compared the current situation to the Russia collusion drama.\n\n\u201cRussia was much more complicated and after two and a half years and after they spent $42 million, there was no collusion, no obstruction, they got nothing, so I think we\u2019re going to keep doing it the way we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, this was no Alfred E. Neuman \u201cWhat, me worry?\u201d nonchalance. To judge from his Twitter account alone, Trump recognizes the stakes, as he fires off tweetstorms almost daily.\n\nYet his energy isn\u2019t all anger. Over the course of 20 minutes or so, he talked about three big reasons why he\u2019s actually optimistic about his situation. If he has any fear of being impeached and removed from office, I didn\u2019t hear it.\n\nThe first thing he\u2019s banking on is the economy. \u201cThe country is doing very well,\u201d he said, a reference to record-low unemployment and the high stock market, which has been wobbly lately.\n\nSecond, he believes Dems are deluding themselves in trying to impeach him on the basis of his phone call with the president of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime, nothing I said was wrong,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cThe whistleblower was totally inaccurate about the call, and it\u2019s all second- and third-hand. It\u2019s a fraud, a hoax, it\u2019s a witch hunt.\u201d\n\nHe was just getting warmed up.\n\n\u201cThese people are trying to destroy our country, they\u2019re sick, there\u2019s something wrong with them,\u201d Trump said. He repeated his complaint about Schiff making up his own dialogue when supposedly quoting from the transcript of the phone call at last week\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cHe quoted the president of the United States in a fraudulent manner, he made the entire thing up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t quote me because there was nothing to quote \u2026 he just made the whole thing up, he\u2019s sick.\u201d\n\nSchiff, who defended his fictional rendition as \u201cparody,\u201d is, ironically, part of the third reason for Trump\u2019s optimism. He cites the \u201ctremendous response\u201d among his supporters, saying they are motivated by the attacks coming from Democrats and the media.\n\n\u201cI see the fundraising, it\u2019s the biggest ever,\u201d Trump said, mentioning the record $125 million take for his campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nPolitico reports that the re-election effort raised $8.5 million online in just the first two days after Pelosi announced the impeachment push, and got 50,000 new small donors. It says the GOP now has $156 million on hand, more than double what \u00adPresident Barack Obama and the Democratic \u00adNational Committee had at the same point before the 2012 election.\n\nTrump was especially proud of the surge of small donors, noting that Republicans never had much success among that group.\n\nHe also is optimistic because he got a call from a group of evangelical pastors who told him their flocks, a bedrock of his support, are more united and determined than ever to give him four more years.\n\nFinally, I asked whether it was still possible for him to work with Pelosi on legislation of any kind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always hard to work with somebody that\u2019s fraudulently doing things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing is a fraud.\u201d\n\nHe again mentioned the transcript of the Ukraine call, saying the speaker \u201cnever saw it\u201d until after making her impeachment decision. \u201cShe had read only the fake whistleblower complaint, which I think she got in advance because it\u2019s collusion.\u201d\n\nOn that, I am in total agreement. Dems, I believe, not only had the complaint, they probably helped to prepare it. The legal citations are a giveaway, as are the many leaks to the anti-Trump media in the days before the complaint became public.\n\nIndeed, in shades of the 2016 FBI-CIA spying on Trump, the inspector general said the CIA agent making the complaint shows \u201carguable political bias.\u201d What a shock.\n\nWith that, the interview was over, but the president had a final thought. \u201cHow is my New York?\u201d he asked, then quickly caught himself to add, \u201cOh, you got a crummy mayor.\u201d\n\nHe mocked Bill de Blasio, noting he had dropped out of the presidential race after registering zero in most polls.\n\n\u201cHow do you get zero,\u201d Trump chuckled. \u201cI mean, can\u2019t you at least one or two points? But he got zero!\u201d", "description": "He also compared the current situation to the Russia collusion drama.", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trump.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
