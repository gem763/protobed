He and his running mate, Brandenburg state politician Klara Geywitz, will face a leftist couple of government critics in the November run-off.\n\nMerkel aides and investors will be relieved by the result, as there were last-minute doubts whether Scholz would be among the top two finishers. Opinion polls with wide margins of error and doubts over online voting security exacerbated uncertainties.\n\nRelieved\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved and at the same time very happy about this good result,\u201d Scholz said at the party\u2019s headquarters in Berlin, sidestepping questions about government policies to focus on party unity.\n\nAt stake is the direction of Merkel\u2019s economic policy and the survival of her coalition in the twilight of her political career. The majority of Scholz\u2019s opponents were from the SPD\u2019s leftist camp and had demanded a series of concessions of Merkel, such as boosting welfare spending or adopting minimum pensions.\n\nThe leadership dispute coincides with a slowdown of Germany\u2019s economic growth to an estimated 0.5% this year from 2.5% just two years ago. It comes only days after Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a Christian Democrat, proposed a peace-keeping force for northern Syria involving German troops. Her failure to consult the SPD, which is traditionally wary of such military commitments, renewed animosity between both parties.\n\nA victory for Scholz in the Nov. 30 run-off would bolster the potential of the 58-year-old labor lawyer to seek the chancellorship when Merkel\u2019s term ends in 2021.\n\nWhat is unclear is whether the splintered leftist vote will now unite against Scholz and make the run-off more difficult, or whether his experience and name-recognition will carry him across the finish line.\n\nSpending\n\nNorbert Walter-Borjans, the 67-year-old former finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, and his running mate, legislator Saskia Esken, placed second with 21% of ballots.\n\nWalter-Borjans, who is in favor of abandoning the government\u2019s zero-deficit spending policy, suggested on Saturday night that it\u2019s time to leave government in order to meet the party\u2019s objectives of creating greater equality and opportunity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s difficult to implement in the grand coalition,\u201d he said.\n\nScholz, who is also deputy chancellor, said he wouldn\u2019t seek to polarize the debate in the second round as the objective was to unite the party. Bitter infighting among the Social Democrats had been blamed as part of the reason for their poor showing in opinion polls.\n\nRead More:Survival of Merkel Coalition at Stake as Allies Vote New ChiefMerkel\u2019s Successor Splits German Coalition With Rogue Syria PlanGermany Readying Stimulus Plan as Contingency for Deep Recession\n\n(Adds finalists\u2019 comments, details, context throughout.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Birgit Jennen in Berlin at bjennen1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Raymond Colitt, Tony Czuczka\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz snatched a first-round win for the leadership of his Social Democratic Party, boosting the chances of survival for Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s ruling coalition.Scholz, the only candidate who unequivocally backed staying in government, took 22.7% of the", "authors": ["Birgit Jennen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rYf8HIogZBSsHy7Sx5Nqcw--~B/aD03NTQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1aac278567a990451aa4f11f51956ac4", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
