Kevin Holland via submission (rear-naked choke) \u2013 Round 2, 3:38\n\nUpdated records: Allen (13-3 MMA, 1-0 UFC), Holland (15-5 MMA, 3-2 UFC)\n\nKey stat: At 23, Allen has now finished his opponent in 12 of his 13 career wins.\n\nAllen on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cI saw the elbow coming (that cut me open). It was slow, so I put my hand away, but he\u2019s so long that it still got there and cut me. I felt it and the blurriness, so I knew I had to deal with it and get him back.\u201d\n\nAllen on dealing with the pressure of his UFC debut\n\n\u201cIt was good to have my fight on (Dana White\u2019s) Contender Series before this because it helped teach me to not put any pressure on myself and take everything in after the fight and not before. I think a win over Kevin shows everyone that I\u2019m here for real and that I belong here. Kevin is a really respectable guy, too. He\u2019s fought some very tough opponents, so I\u2019m glad to be the first person to finish him since he\u2019s been in the UFC.\u201d\n\nAllen on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI want that fight (against Eryk Anders) back. I was a lot younger, had been through some things in the camp, and he was the better man that night. He\u2019s got a good name. He\u2019s got a good following. I have a lot of respect for that guy, both inside the cage and out. Good guy, good family man, and business is business. I want to avenge that loss.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Allen, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.", "description": "Brendan Allen has his desired next moves all plotted out after an entertaining win in his octagon debut at UFC on ESPN 6.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Simon Samano", "The Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/brendan-allen-ufc-boston-post-fight-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
