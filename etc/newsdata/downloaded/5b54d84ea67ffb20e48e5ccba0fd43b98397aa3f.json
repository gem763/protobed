For instance, one PwC contract for $2.4 million simply says \"defence support services\".\n\nOther large contracts not flagged as consultancies included a $21 million piece of work with KPMG for \"strategic partner services\", an $18 million piece of work with EY for \"organisational change management partner services\" and another $17 million for KPMG to provide \"support services\" under the category of \"management advisory services\".\n\nA Defence spokesman said the category that references consulting or advisory work may be used for contracts that do not involve consulting or advisory work. He then added that Defence published information in its annual report in line with guidelines issued by the Finance Department.\n\n\"Defence does not agree that the categories identified are in all cases consultancies,\" the spokesman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The presentation of information in our annual report is consistent with guidelines issued by the Department of Finance. Defence regularly reviews data in AusTender to ensure the contracts classified as consultancy are correct.\n\n\"In addition, to determine the consultancy expenditure data in the 2018-19 Defence Annual Report, Defence has examined contracts within its financial system to validate that AusTender is complete and correct.\"\n\n'Overpriced body-shopping'\n\nThe problems of inconsistent consulting classification by departments is well known.\n\nIn early 2018, the Auditor-General highlighted \"a substantial difference\" between the value of contracts identified as consultancies and the total value of contracts for the identified suppliers.\n\nLater it was revealed contracts worth $200 million \"magically disappeared\" from a federal database after an audit report highlighted alarming growth in the use of external advisory firms throughout the public service.\n\nA Coalition-led inquiry into the use of consultants and contractors was allowed to lapse before the May federal election without releasing a report.\n\nMr Hill, the deputy chair of Parliament's public accounts and audit committee, said the latest figures were outrageous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Auditor-General has raised questions about the under-classification of consultancies, the heads of the independent review into the public service raised questions and the joint committee of public accounts and audit heard a tonne of evidence showing that the government cannot provide a reliable picture of just how much they're spending on consultants,\" he said.\n\n\"These figures show the problem is getting worse, not better. It appears the government is out of control and spending like a drunken sailor on consultants.\"\n\nMr Hill accused the Coalition of showing an arrogant disregard for the Parliament and scrutiny.\n\nHe described much of the work as \"overpriced body-shopping\", outside the capability of departments because of staffing caps.\n\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann told Senate estimates hearings the opposition and public sector unions wanted to suggest an \"explosion\" in spending on consultants and contractors.\n\nHe cited figures from the 2019-20 budget papers and said AusTender was a transparency website, not a financial reporting or forecasting tool.\n\n\"As a proportion of total government expenses, [consulting spending] decreased from 8.5 per cent in 2007-08 to 7 per cent in 2018-19 and I expect it to further decrease to 5.4 per cent by 2022-23,\" he said.\n\n\"If there was an explosion in the cost of contractors and consultants, which is a component of the cost of government administration, that would not be happening.\"", "description": "The Defence Department may be understating its bill for consultants by more than $1.5 billion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5565%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e6f9804ff16b4d14e750b125fa8848f1d80a9056", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
