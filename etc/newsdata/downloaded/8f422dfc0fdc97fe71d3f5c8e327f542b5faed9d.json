Mud Bruneteau of the Detroit Red Wings (1940-45) and Yvon Cournoyer of the Montreal Canadiens (1973-78) also scored in six straight.\n\nJoonas Korpisalo, who inherited Columbus\u2018 starting goalie job when Sergei Bobrovsky was lost to Florida via free agency, made 25 saves.\n\n\u201cToronto was a great team last year, they\u2019re a great team this year, it shows the speed we got to play with,\u201d Columbus defenseman Seth Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to get faster from here.\u201d\n\nToronto struck first 8 seconds into a power play in the first period when Marner beat Korpisalo from the left circle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I worked a lot on this summer, getting the puck in my hands and getting the shot off quicker, not holding onto it and making pretty plays,\u201d Marner said. \u201cJust try getting it to the net.\u201d\n\nCeci then connected with a wrist shot 10:35 into the second.\n\nColumbus made it a one-goal game when Atkinson scored later in the second period, just 4 seconds into a Jackets power play. Andersen came out to swat at a loose puck but whiffed, and Atkinson was there to take advantage of the empty net.\n\nThat would be it for the Blue Jackets.\n\nMarner put Toronto up 3-1 early in the third when his shot from close in trickled into the crease and was pushed into the net by Korpisalo\u2019s skate.\n\nMatthews got his third goal of the season late in the third on a power play, shooting from the right circle.\n\n\u201cI thought we were playing pretty good when we went up 2-0, got carried away and turned the puck over a number of times, and they got some momentum,\u201d Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock said. \u201cBut we got ourselves reset in between the second and third and came out and played well.\u201d\n\nExcept for the five penalties, the Blue Jackets - who also lost star forward Artemi Panarin to free agency in the offseason - didn\u2019t play badly but couldn\u2019t take advantage of their offensive opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a team you can\u2019t let on the power play,\u201d Columbus captain Nick Foligno said. \u201cWe obviously tested that too many times tonight and it cost us. Other than that, I really liked our game. I thought we did a lot of good things.\u201d\n\nNOTES: D Morgan Rielly had three assists for Toronto\u2026.F Jason Spezza made his Maple Leafs debut after being a healthy scratch in a season-opening 5-3 over Ottawa on Wednesday night.
