Is that why this sly, sexy spellbinding exhibition \u2013 which includes the personal belongings of ex-US secretary of defence Robert McNamara \u2013 revels in serendipity?\n\nDanh V\u00f4\u2019s is an art of coincidence: of people and places, history and anecdote, objects and images. Overwhelming in its complexity, V\u00f4\u2019s exhibition at the South London Gallery is further complicated by a concurrent show at Marian Goodman\u2019s London gallery.\n\nBorn in Vietnam in 1975, V\u00f4 escaped with his family in 1979, in a boat built by his father that was picked up by a Danish vessel. This perhaps accounts to some degree for the role of serendipity and chance encounters in his art. Every work, every group of photographs, every object is an amalgam of stories, references and symbols. The SLG provides a useful commentary to V\u00f4\u2019s exhibition, which he calls Untitled; a lazy non-title you might say, until you realise that a reversal of his name to V\u00f4 Danh means unnamed or nameless in Vietnamese, the words often found on gravestones in the country, where so many died, unidentified, in the war with the US.\n\nAccidents of history, chance encounters, confrontations and collaborations all play their part in V\u00f4\u2019s largest UK exhibition to date. Sometimes I feel I am drowning in its multiplicities. Whatever you grasp \u2013 a solid walnut cuboid, a hand-copied letter, a second-century Greek marble torso of Apollo in a little wooden crate that once held tins of Carnation milk \u2013 is itself a link in almost endless chain of associations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Surreptitiously shot \u2026 photographs by Dr Joseph M Carrier, a counter insurgency specialist. Photograph: Nick Ash\n\nV\u00f4\u2019s art is also filled with moments of loveliness and provocation. He is as much a provocateur as he is an aesthete. He can be sexy, sly, funny, harrowing and heartfelt, and some of his motifs \u2013 lines taken from William Friedkin\u2019s 1973 demonic possession movie The Exorcist, or the last letter of a Jesuit missionary, written on the day of his execution in Vietnam in 1861 \u2013 recur often enough to make us feel that there is an ongoing narrative at work. The sacred and profane, guilt and redemption play their part.\n\nFramed snatches of dialogue from The Exorcist abut paintings by Danish artist Peter Bonde, V\u00f4\u2019s former teacher at the Royal Danish Academy. As a student, V\u00f4 had a vexed relationship with his tutor, whose work he thought was too macho, while Bonde encouraged V\u00f4 to give up painting. Bonde often shows his paintings in a manner close to V\u00f4\u2019s installation here, butting-up large works and small, and playing with the autonomy of different elements. Bonde has been painting for some time on mirrored panels, leaving some areas of the surface unpainted, so that our reflections become jumbled with his gestural brushstrokes. His paintings here are incomplete monochromes, their surfaces filled with swipes and drags of a single yellow-green pigment that glows in the dark. The paint is incompletely mixed with a translucent, colourless medium. One can read the paintings as ectoplasm, or the bile the possessed child vomits in Friedkin\u2019s movie. They also look like mirrors smeared with semen and lube.\n\nAs well as calligraphic portions of dialogue from Friedkin\u2019s film, V\u00f4 includes photographic portraits of his adolescent nephew Gustav, shot by V\u00f4\u2019s lover Heinz Peter Knes. In his black trousers and red top, a pack of Marlboro reds pocking out of his pocket, Gustav walks and poses and sits on V\u00f4\u2019s studio floor, trousers caked from the plaster and dust.\n\nDanh V\u00f5 and Carol Rama review \u2013 poignant relics of family and friendship Read more\n\nThe photos cast Gustav as a fashion model. V\u00f4 describes him as his muse. They punctuate Bonde\u2019s paintings and jostle against the framed portions of text. Do the red and the black reference Stendhal and his 1830 novel Le Rouge et le Noir with its talented young provincial and the tension between the religious and the secular in his ambitious rise?\n\nThere\u2019s a definite lubriciousness to all this. It is all already too much, even without the occasional sculptures and pieces of furniture, which include a daybed, fashioned in black walnut and based on a 1974 design by Italian designer Enzo Mari. At auction some years ago V\u00f4 bought a number of the personal possessions of Robert McNamara, the US secretary of defence in the lead up to the Vietnam war, to use in his work. Later, McNamara\u2019s son Craig contacted the artist and they became friends. Craig is the owner of a sustainable, organic farming enterprise in California, which he now farms with his own son. The land included a large orchard of walnut trees, originally planted with the intention of using the timber for rifle stocks. He subsequently gave V\u00f4 the timber from 10 hectares of felled trees; much of it has ended up in London.\n\nRough-sawn and finished walnut planks, including the heartwood, sapwood, bark and massy root boles \u2013 some split and with metal and wooden wedges driven into them \u2013 are stacked on the ground floor of Marian Goodman gallery. Walnut sawhorses and beautifully constructed carpentry benches occupy the upper gallery. A small, child-size chair, made to the design of Bauhaus artist Franz Ehrlich, which he sketched while in Buchenwald concentration camp, and another stool designed by Enzo Mari that can be assembled using only nails and a hammer, stand about. The air is rich with the smell of wood. The gallery is both exhibition and timber yard, carpentry workshop and joinery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres, \u201cUntitled\u201d (Portrait of Julie Ault), 1991.

They depict young Vietnamese men holding hands, resting, eating, going about their days. Smoke rises on the horizon in one telling shot.\n\nIn one room at SLG, V\u00f4 includes a smaller show-within-a-show with his friend Julie Ault, another artist who, as she describes it, makes exhibitions rather than single artworks. Andres Serrano\u2019s Piss Christ (Ault and Serrano were married at one time) and a Nancy Spero drawing of a head with its tongue poking out feature. An almost spherical sculpture by Roni Horn, which is neither sphere nor ovoid nor ball but an inexact shape of no name, sits on the floor. This might be a metaphorical self-portrait of Horn herself, or a description of artists, like Ault, V\u00f4 and Horn, whose art slips between cracks. It derives its energy from tensions between different kinds of activities, from collaboration, friendships, histories and lineages as much as from the forms their individual art takes.\n\nThere is more. There is always more. V\u00f4 has sited Isamu Noguchi\u2019s wonderful 1975-6 Play sculpture next to the playground on Pelican housing estate; the references to martyred missionaries; the second-century marble Eros combined with a sandstone eagle that once adorned the Reich Ministry of Transport in Berlin, a building that later became an illegal party venue in the 1990s. Everything connects. Things cleave apart and together. V\u00f4 sucks you in. What a wonderfully engaging, disarming and alarming artist he is. I cannot recommend his work enough.\n\n\u2022At South London Gallery until 24 November, and the Marian Goodman gallery, London, until 1 November.", "description": "He fled Vietnam in a boat built by his father.
