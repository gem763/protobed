time ago in a galaxy far, far away\n\nThis was the Easter egg that revived the idea of Google Easter eggs, as well as being a big part of the huge array of little nuggets that the company added to celebrate the imminent release of the new Star Wars film.\n\nSearching for this will turn your entire screen into the opening crawl from the Star Wars films, and all of the results will be rendered in the creeping yellow on black text that comes at the start.\n\n\u2018Do a barrel roll\u2019 or \u2018z or r twice\u2019\n\nThis one is fairly self-explanatory: it makes the entire screen showing the results spin around in a 360.\n\nThe wording is a reference to Star Fox, the video game. On that you\u2019d be instructed to \u201cdo a barrel roll\u201d \u2013 and that was done by pressing the Z or R button twice.\n\nSuper Mario Bros\n\nWhen you search for this phrase, a little information box comes up \u2013 as it does with many Google results. But inside of that is a little box, like from the games.\n\nPressing the button sends a coin up, and plays the nostalgia-inducing sound. And repeatedly clicking will lead to other things happening, too.\n\nAskew\n\nTyping this sends the results slightly tilted, or askew \u2013 as you might expect.\n\nZerg rush\n\nZerg rush originates from StarCraft, where it describes a huge onslaught from a race that could populate extra-quickly, called Zergs.\n\nWhen you Google this phrase, a huge swarm of Os will arrive, which you need to click to destroy before they eat up all of the search results.\n\nOnce in a blue moon\n\nThis isn\u2019t so much fun and pernickety \u2013 searching for this phrase tells you exactly how often once in a blue moon is.\n\n(It\u2019s 1.16699016 \u00d7 10-8 hertz, in case you\u2019re interested.)\n\nRecursion\n\nSearching this will recommend you click a link to the Google results for recursion. Clicking that will take you to a page that recommends you click a link to the Google results for recursion.\n\nAnd so it goes, recursively.", "description": "Most of the time, Google is a helpful and uninteresting place for finding information.
