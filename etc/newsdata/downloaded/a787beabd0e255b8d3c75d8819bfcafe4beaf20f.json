Wasn\u2019t it?\n\nTo Dana White and Co., he was a stepping stone. Masvidal remembers thinking the same thing.\n\n\u201cI want to say you\u2019re a mind reader,\u201d Masvidal told MMA Junkie during Monday\u2019s UFC 244 conference call when asked about this.\n\nIn the UFC\u2019s defense, it was hard to argue otherwise. Masvidal sat out all of 2018 after spending a portion of the year filming a Spanish-language reality TV show, and he was 4-5 in his previous nine fights dating back to April 2015.\n\nAt the time, in January, rising British star Darren Till was one of the UFC\u2019s favorites, viewed as a star in the making \u2013 young, talented, can trash with the best of them. But Till also was just a few months removed from the first loss of his career after getting schooled by Tyron Woodley before being submitted in the second round of their UFC 228 welterweight title fight.\n\nAnd so, White and the UFC matchmakers turned to Masvidal. A win over the 16-year veteran with name value among hardcore MMA fans certainly would get Till back on track \u2013 except it didn\u2019t pan out like that. Masvidal knocked out Till in the second round of their UFC on ESPN+ 5 headliner in London.\n\nTen months, a \u201c3-piece and a soda,\u201d and one record-breaking flying knee later, Masvidal approaches the biggest fight of his career. He and Nate Diaz will headline UFC 244, perhaps the biggest card of the year, on Saturday at Madison Square Garden and fight for a made-up-but-still-meaningful \u201cBMF\u201d title belt. And while the first step here was the Till knockout, Masvidal hasn\u2019t forgotten his intended purpose.\n\nOr how slighted he felt.\n\n\u201cMaybe they were. Maybe they weren\u2019t,\u201d Masvidal said of the UFC using him in hopes of a Till rebound. \u201cMe? I was just licking my chops, man, like \u2018I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re gonna give me this dude.\u2019 I knew they\u2019d been pushing him real hard. And in I way, it was like, I beat that dude (Donald Cerrone), too. I beat him first, and I didn\u2019t get the same push that he got after the \u2018Cowboy\u2019 fight. So I was like, \u2018I wanna fight this dude. I wanna hurt him.\u2019 And it\u2019s not like I dislike him or nothing on a personal level; I think the kid\u2019s cool. But I just wanted to scrap. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe UFC had to learn the hard way. I\u2019m glad to teach the UFC lessons, life lessons like, hey, don\u2019t ever underestimate me.\u201d\n\nAs in life, sometimes it\u2019s funny how things work out in the fight game. Just two months before being booked against Till, Masvidal was linked to a fight with Nick Diaz. Masvidal was ecstatic about the matchup because of his respect for the Diaz brothers as fighters \u2013 \u201cthe dog in them,\u201d as he put it.\n\nFor Masvidal, there was no better way to return from a year-long layoff. So when the fight with the elder Diaz brother fell through, it was discouraging.\n\n\u201cI remember at the moment I was a little heartbroken,\u201d Masvidal said. \u201cI had stepped away from the sport for a year. I came back, and obviously I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m like a kid in the Christmas store, the same way when Nate called me out that (my fight with Nick) is gonna materialize. So when that doesn\u2019t happen, I was devastated.\u201d\n\nMavidal continued, \u201cI was coming off two losses, and I was in the darkest of the dark places I\u2019ve been to. And I\u2019ve been to some dark places from time to time. I slowly but surely started coming out, and the person that came out of that dark place is not the person that went into that dark place. That person is no longer with us. That old \u2018Gamebred\u2019 inspired the new one, and he\u2019s here just ready to go.\u201d\n\nFew could\u2019ve imagined when 2019 began that Masvidal, all things considered, would become a legit UFC star. Except Masvidal himself always believed.\n\n\u201cSince I came back, I\u2019ve seen everything that was gonna unfold and unravel,\u201d Masvidal said. \u201cI looked at the whole landscape. I looked at No. 1 through No. 10, and I said, \u2018Man, I\u2019m gonna have a field day if they let me back in here. If they don\u2019t stop me from fighting this year, I\u2019m gonna hurt a lot of feelings.\u2019 And that\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing, man.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you: This year was big, and next year\u2019s gonna be even bigger.\u201d", "description": "Jorge Masvidal began 2019 booked in a fight to help a rising star rebound, but look at him now: UFC 244 headliner and BMF title challenger.", "authors": ["Simon Samano", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/jorge-masvidal-ufc-london-3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
