MPs attending are understood to include the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, Ian Blackford of the Scottish National party, Liz Saville Roberts of Plaid Cymru, Anna Soubry of Change UK and the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas.\n\nThe Labour leader told the audience in Salford that the party\u2019s priority was trying to pass the bill. However, when he was asked if he would back a general election, he said he would, even in event that the prime minister put it forward for a vote himself.\n\nAn hour later, Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister, told the BBC that an election was a secondary issue. She said: \u201cOur mission here is to prevent no deal. We do want a general election \u2026 [but] our mission is very clear, and it is about preventing no deal. If that means that a general election cannot happen at that particular point, then stopping no deal must come first.\u201d\n\nBut on Monday evening, Corbyn reiterated his eagerness to go to the country, telling a rally in Salford: \u201cI will be delighted when the election comes. I\u2019m ready for it, you\u2019re ready for it \u2013 we\u2019ll take that message out there and above all we will win.\u201d\n\nA senior Labour source said that avoiding no deal and wanting a general election could run concurrently as party policies and discussions about timing were an attempt to \u201csplit hairs\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said Labour was working with other parties to deliver the no-deal legislation in parliament, but also supported a general election and that the shadow cabinet was working on a bigger manifesto than Labour\u2019s 2017 platform.\n\nHowever, the Labour leadership faced criticism for expressing enthusiasm at the prospect of an election. The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair gave a speech to the Institute for Government earlier on Monday in which he urged against the \u201celephant trap\u201d of an election before the UK\u2019s departure from the EU was resolved and warned that polling rated Labour as unlikely to win.\n\nThat was echoed by the Labour MP Tony Lloyd, who told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fight an election that allows Boris Johnson to crash us out [of the EU].\u201d\n\nFellow Labour MP Mary Creagh agreed, telling the same programme: \u201cI think we are all ready for a general election \u2026 we aren\u2019t going to agree to one when there is a threat of a no-deal Brexit hanging over the country.\u201d\n\nCorbyn touched on the majority of the party\u2019s policy areas during the 30-minute address in Salford and focused particularly on pledges for the north of England, in what could be seen as overtures to Labour supporters in leave-voting areas.\n\nPromises to invest in Crossrail in the north, which would link Liverpool and Hull, received a cheer from the audience, and he pledged to rebalance the economy away from London, reverse council cuts and invest in manufacturing.\n\nCorbyn said Labour was prepared to work with other parties to stop no deal. \u201cWe will do everything we can to stop a no-deal exit from the European Union. That is our priority,\u201d he said.\n\nA vote of no confidence in Johnson also remained on the table, he said: \u201cWe will do everything we can in the coming weeks to prevent no deal. We want a general election so the people of this country can decide their future and we are very clear that we would in the Labour manifesto include a public vote under a Labour government with the option of remain or whatever alternative parliament has come to.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s no deal, then we vote to remain. If it\u2019s any other deal, then our party\u2019s democratic processes will decide what position we take.\u201d\n\nLong-Bailey said: \u201cUltimately, we are in a position now where we\u2019ve got to put country before party to stop a no-deal Brexit from happening and any MP shouldn\u2019t be precious about what piece of legislation [is put] down as long as it does what it says on the tin.\u201d\n\nThe shadow cabinet met in Salford on Monday afternoon to finalise their position. A source said there had been a \u201cbit of back and forth\u201d between MPs but that they had galvanised around the proposed no-deal legislation.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any pushback on the bill,\u201d a source close to the shadow cabinet said.", "description": "Labour leader vows to defeat Tories but others say preventing no-deal Brexit should be main priority", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1af30fb040c3a85b3e894b332da4be6af3d26a1/862_421_5261_3157/master/5261.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bddf97271b58c76e88bbb432766de328"}
