Liverpool have set a relentless pace at the top of the Premier League and Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham have stalled.\n\nAfter nine games Liverpool lead the table by six points from Manchester City while Tottenham are already 13 points adrift in seventh spot after only three league wins all season \u2014 their worst start since Pochettino\u2019s debut season in 2014-15.\n\nCity can halve the gap to Liverpool when they host Aston Villa on Saturday, while the weekend\u2019s programme gets underway on Friday with third-placed Leicester City at Southampton.\n\nFourth-placed Chelsea are at Burnley in Saturday\u2019s late kickoff while Manchester United, in 14th place, will hope a trip to struggling Norwich City on Sunday can spark a climb up the table after failing to win any of their last four league games.\n\nAll sorts of theories have been presented as to why Tottenham have fallen away, including a Champions League hangover, a frustrating transfer window and even Pochettino becoming stale after working wonders to keep the north London club in the top four, four seasons in a row.\n\nPochettino could at least afford a smile again on Tuesday when his side thrashed Red Star Belgrade 5-0 to kickstart their Champions League campaign. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min both scored twice in a performance that hinted that Tottenham might be ready to emerge from their slump.\n\nLiverpool at Anfield represent a far tougher proposition though, especially considering that Pochettino\u2019s record against them in all competitions since becoming Tottenham manager reads seven defeats, four draws and only one victory.\n\nDespite the head-to-head record, Tottenham under Pochettino finished above Liverpool in the Premier League four seasons in a row until Klopp\u2019s side ended as runners-up last season to Manchester City, 26 points above Spurs.\n\nThere is little to suggest that chasm will close any time soon, although Klopp will be wary of a Tottenham side who perhaps should have won at Anfield last season. Moussa Sissoko wasted a glorious late chance before a 90th-minute own goal by Toby Alderweireld handed Liverpool a 2-1 victory.\n\nTottenham will also be buoyed by their record Champions League victory on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get too carried away with it. We have to stay focused and take the positives (of the result) and take them into the Premier League,\u201d Kane said.\n\n\u201cWe have got a very tough game on Sunday so I hope we can take momentum into that.\u201d\n\nLiverpool\u2019s 17-match winning run in the Premier League came to an end in a 1-1 draw at Manchester United last weekend but the size of Tottenham\u2019s task was underlined as Klopp\u2019s men crushed Genk 4-1 away in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nKlopp immediately turned his thoughts to Tottenham.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a refreshed Tottenham,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course the second they meet us they\u2019re back on track!\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re a different team to Red Star Belgrade, just like Tottenham are different to Genk.\u201d", "description": "Premier League leaders Liverpool meet Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday for the first time since a sultry June night in Madrid ended with Juergen Klopp's side crowned champions of Europe.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444332021&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N04I", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
