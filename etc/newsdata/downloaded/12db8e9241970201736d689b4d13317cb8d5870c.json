It\u2019s so strange\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Ann Patchett is the author of eight critically acclaimed novels, including State of Wonder and Commonwealth. Bel Canto (2001) won the Orange prize, the PEN/Faulkner award and was a finalist in the National Book Critics Circle award. She has also written celebrated works of nonfiction, including This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage, and co-owns a bookshop in her home town of Nashville, Tennessee. Her new novel, The Dutch House, is a masterful depiction of ruptured family relationships, the power of sibling bonds and the nature of home.\n\nThe protagonists in The Dutch House become obsessed with their childhood home after they\u2019re turfed out by their stepmother. Do you think people too often get fixated on the past?\n\nSo many people just get stuck in their childhood and shoulder that burden through everything. It becomes their defining feature in life. Danny and Maeve [the novel\u2019s main characters] chew on their loss of the house: they make it a fetish. I see people doing that and I just think, You can\u2019t still be feeling this loss. You\u2019ve made this your hobby.\n\nProperty is both a sanctuary and a burden in the novel. Was that something you set out to explore?\n\nI hadn\u2019t consciously set out to explore that and yet the further along I went the more I could see it and the more I could think about the burden of things. I am somebody who feels the burden of things. I think I would have made a swell nun.\n\nThe novel is also about memory: whether we can only ever view the past through the prism of the present. Do you think memory is ultimately unreliable?\n\nYes, I think that memory is almost a living thing for every person. I was in downtown New York on September 11 with a friend and we were there at the World Trade Center when it fell. We had this huge life-changing day together. Several years later, we sat down and we talked about that day and it was as if we had been on different planets. We remembered every single thing about the day differently. Memory is unreliable and yet we are completely positive that we are right.\n\nGive me a story about a rabbit who\u2019s had a very hard time of it and I will be weeping\n\nOne of the novel\u2019s central questions is how we deal with grief. Do you think culturally we are ill-equipped?\n\nWe don\u2019t have enough time to deal with our grief. We\u2019re almost embarrassed by grief. It\u2019s so strange. We have two things absolutely in common: we\u2019re born and we die. And everyone goes through those two experiences in a remarkably similar way, with a few medical details to separate us. But the facts are the facts: we weren\u2019t here and then we\u2019re not here again. But we can\u2019t bear to think about it.\n\nYou have said in the past that you can\u2019t write villains. But Andrea Conroy is an almost fairytale wicked stepmother. Why did you feel able to write a villain now?\n\nI was interviewing Zadie Smith about the idea of writing an autobiographical novel. She said she was writing about the kind of mother she was afraid of being. You can write something very autobiographical that has never happened to you because it\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid of. And I wanted to write about the kind of stepmother that I would be afraid of being.\n\nThere are many fairytale elements in the book. Did you feel as if you were writing a modern-day fairytale?\n\nYes. I grew up on lives of the saints, which are fairytales. Whether it\u2019s Hansel and Gretel or Saint Francis throwing out the last of his bread for the birds \u2013 it all comes together. Catholicism: it\u2019s just kind of a big fairytale. The parables: fairytales. I\u2019m a very plot-driven person and I think it all goes back to fairytales and parables and saints.\n\nSo were you reading parables rather than fairytales growing up?\n\nI was reading them all interchangeably. When you think about it, they really are just the same. There are morals, the good people are lifted up, the bad people get their justice in the end, there\u2019s a certain amount of magic involved. I can scarcely remember which goes into which camp.\n\nWhich writers have most influenced you?\n\nPhilip Roth, John Updike and Saul Bellow. Those were the authors my parents were reading when I was in high school and so those were the books that were lying around. I think influence has more to do with when you read something than who you read.\n\nWhich writers working today do you admire the most?\n\nZadie Smith, Colson Whitehead, Elizabeth Strout, Donna Tartt, Michael Chabon. I could go on.\n\nWhat do you read for sheer pleasure?\n\nAnything and everything by Kate DiCamillo. Give me a story about a rabbit who\u2019s had a very hard time of it and I will be weeping. Give me a story about a mouse who has his tail cut off trying to save a princess: it means the world to me.\n\nHas owning a bookshop changed your relationship to books?\n\nI used to live my life reading EM Forster and Henry James. That\u2019s what I used to read and love and dream about. Now I read everything in galleys [advanced copies]. I read 10 or 20 pages of something, chuck it aside and start the next thing.\n\nIs there a book you wish you\u2019d written?\n\nOld Filth by Jane Gardam. It\u2019s absolutely perfect. It\u2019s one of those books that I think of as a universal donor: everyone I give that book to is thrilled by it. It\u2019s a rare book that covers birth to death which is frankly impossible to do.\n\nAnd a book you think is overrated?\n\nI\u2019m way too polite for that.\n\nIs there a very famous book \u2013 contemporary or classic \u2013 that you\u2019ve never got around to reading?\n\nHow much time do you have? All I do is read and all I do is realise how much I haven\u2019t read. I\u2019ve only read one Trollope novel.\n\nWho would you like to write the story of your life?\n\nDavid Sedaris. I love him and he\u2019d embarrass me to death.\n\nCommonwealth by Ann Patchett review \u2013 it started with a kiss Read more\n\nWhat\u2019s the last great book you read?\n\nThe Resisters by Gish Jen. It\u2019s coming out in February. It\u2019s a book that means to save the world. I can\u2019t begin to tell you how brilliant it is.\n\nWhat books are on your bedside table to read next?\n\nThe Giver of Stars by Jojo Moyes and Deep River by Karl Marlantes. I\u2019m currently reading American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins: it\u2019s fantastic.\n\n\u2022 The Dutch House by Ann Patchett is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a318.99).
