Biden will make public his personal medial records prior to any Democratic primaries taking place, the former vice president pledged Friday.\n\n\u201cBefore there\u2019s a first vote, I\u2019ll release my medical records,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters while campaigning in Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to not release my medical records.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden, 76, is currently considered the frontrunner among some 20 fellow candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge President Trump in next year\u2019s election. He is also the eldest among the pack and would surpass Mr. Trump, 73, as the oldest candidate to assume the presidency if victorious in next year\u2019s White House race.\n\nRivals of Mr. Biden from both sides of the aisle have recently seemed to question whether he has the stamina and wherewithal to win in 2020: Mr. Trump has regularly attacked his likely challenger as \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d and fellow Democratic candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro repeatedly accused Mr. Biden on the debate stage Thursday evening of having forgotten about remarks he made minutes earlier.\n\nSpeaking with reporters the day after the debate, Mr. Biden was asked if he would release his medical records \u201cto address concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!

Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are ages 78 and 70, respectively.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
