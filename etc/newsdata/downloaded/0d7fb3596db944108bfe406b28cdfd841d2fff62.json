protecting and sustainably developing the rainforest. Now the president is taking that message to the UN.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations General Assembly could be a great opportunity for Brazil to present and clarify its foreign policy,\u201d said Sergio Amaral, Brazil\u2019s ambassador to Washington DC until earlier this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a chance to demonstrate its \u201ccommitment to sensitive issues for the international community, like the environment.\u201d\n\nThe question remains of how Mr Bolsonaro can both calm fears over deforestation while asserting Brazil\u2019s right to develop the Amazon.\n\nThere\u2019s also the added tension of his likely interaction with French President Emmanuel Macron - whose wife the Brazilian leader insulted.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Ahead of the G7 Mr Macron threatened to scrap the EU-Mercosur trade deal over what he described as Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201clies\u201d over his commitment to climate change.\n\nThe US clothing company VF Corporation, which owns Timberland, Kipling Bags and The North Face, has suspended Brazilian leather purchases, and Norway\u2019s two biggest investors have warned global companies against contributing to environmental damage. Brazilian embassies have also been targeted by protesters.\n\nFitch Solutions Macro Research, formerly BMI Research, issued two reports warning of \u201cincreased scrutiny\u201d and \u201ceconomic risks\u201d after the fires.\n\n\u201cWe believe that international concern over deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon basin will create headwinds to export demand and investment inflows,\u201d Mr Fitch wrote.\n\nFor Amaral, Brazil has rapidly lost its hard-won reputation as a leader on environmental issues. Aside from the blow back from certain countries or corporations, individual consumers may start to reject Brazilian products.\n\n\u201cThis change is terrible for the country, terrible for the image of the country and for the perception of consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nBrazil has fallen four places this year in the global ranking of the Country Brand Index, a measure developed by the Sao Paulo-based global branding consultancy FutureBrand, and now ranks 47th out of 75.\n\nThe survey was completed in July, before the fires in the Amazon, but took into account the first six months of Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is a very sensitive topic, with huge repercussions, and it comes on top of a number of negative issues associated with Brazil in the past few years,\u201d Daniel Alencar, partner-director of FutureBrand, said. But, he added, a country\u2019s brand is constantly in flux. \u201cNo single event is going to destroy the image of Brazil.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will head to New York on Monday in an attempt to defuse the international outcry over the fires raging through the Amazon while simultaneously asserting the country\u2019s right to develop the rainforest as it sees fit.", "authors": ["Bruce Douglas", "Simone Iglesias"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/17/brazil.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
