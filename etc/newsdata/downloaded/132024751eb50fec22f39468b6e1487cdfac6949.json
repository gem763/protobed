And we're back to where we were in 2011.'\n\nTo do that, Edwards \u2014 whose mantra remains 'defence wins championships' \u2014 wants Wales to up their game, having conceded five tries thus far.\n\nWhen asked if he thinks the glut of points will slow down come the knockout stages, Edwards quipped: 'I hope it does for us. I couldn't care less about anyone else!\n\n'I am hoping we put in an 80-minute strong defensive performance. I was pleased with huge aspects of the game against Australia \u2014 we were under huge amounts of pressure in the second half \u2014 but we have not yet put in an 80-minute performance at the World Cup.\n\n'The way the game is at the moment there has never been as many points scored in rugby union with all the law changes. I am not saying that's a bad thing \u2014 fans want to see some tries, don't they?\n\nHadleigh Parkes scores Wales' first try against the Aussies in their four-point victory last week\n\n'It's obviously very difficult to defend for that length of period and it's credit to our fitness staff for the preparations the boys have been put through. If we had not been so fit we would have succumbed at the end because we would have been under so much pressure.\n\n'In 2013 we did not concede a try in the Six Nations for five games and in 2008 we conceded two tries in the whole championship. You do not get anywhere near that at the moment because of all the law changes.\n\n'If you ask any defence coach around the world it is making their job harder. You used to give target points and those have gone up hugely over the last few years.'\n\nBut Edwards knows that the Fijians will present a unique challenge to Wales' defence next Wednesday in Oita.\n\n'Some of their trick plays around lineouts and starter plays from scrums with the athletes they have are very difficult to defend against,' he said.\n\n'We are under no illusions about what they'll bring. Their set-piece is very good too. I thought their scrum in the game against Georgia was excellent.\n\n'They are very well coached and organised, and have that X-factor.'", "description": "Wales have only made the last four twice, in 1987 and 2011, but defence coach Edwards is setting bar high after wins against Georgia and Australia and group games against Fiji and Uruguay left.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/15/19300186-0-image-a-65_1570198728927.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
