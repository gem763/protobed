According to 49ers tight end George Kittle, Shanahan awarded a game ball to his father, Mike, whose head coaching tenure with the Redskins ended on less-than-friendly terms.\n\n\u201cPretty special,\u201d Kittle said.\n\nMike Shanahan was not on hand for the game, according to a 49ers spokesman. But Kittle said 49ers players were mindful of the Shanahans\u2019 past dealings with the Redskins and were motivated by that.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were aware,\u201d Kittle said. \u201cDefinitely it was a game that we wanted to win both for him and Mike Shanahan.\u201d\n\nThe game was as inelegant as it gets and undoubtedly not what Kyle Shanahan had in mind when he envisioned a triumphant return to FedEx Field as the head coach of an undefeated team. But he wasn\u2019t complaining.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a number of buildings, and not all of it always ends good,\u201d Shanahan said after the game. \u201cBut it had nothing to do with the game. Everyone\u2019s a little more sensitive when things involve your family. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m always a little more sensitive to this with my dad here. And that\u2019s why it was nice to get the win. But it had nothing to do with the game, has nothing to do with the score. But you always want to take care of things the right way when you\u2019re bothered by how some things have been for a family member.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShanahan, the offensive coordinator for the Redskins during his father\u2019s head coaching tenure from 2010 to 2013, had upped the stakes during the week by saying that working for his dad had been his favorite part of his time in Washington and \u201ceverything else\u201d had been his least favorite part. Shanahan said he had moved on and this game wasn\u2019t personal to him. But did anyone believe that?\n\nShanahan said Sunday he certainly enjoyed watching 49ers players celebrate the win with what amounted to rain angels on the wet turf following a game-ending sack by rookie defensive end Nick Bosa.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely fun watching our whole team slide across the field there,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI enjoyed watching that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAsked whether he had considered joining the players, Shanahan said: \u201cI did think about it, yeah. But I don\u2019t think I would have done it right.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe 49ers forged the victory on a trio of second-half field goals by kicker Robbie Gould as they and the Redskins sloshed around on a waterlogged field drenched by persistent rain.\n\n\u201cIt was fun,\u201d cornerback Richard Sherman said. \u201cIt was Mud Bowl 2019 champions, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\nThe 49ers have put themselves in contention in the jumbled NFC, in Year 3 of a rebuilding project overseen by Shanahan and General Manager John Lynch, because they are a balanced and versatile team able to win in a variety of ways. They entered this week\u2019s play ranked second in the NFL in total defense and third in total offense.\n\nAD\n\nThey were tested Sunday by the conditions as much as by the Redskins. Passing was an adventure. Any change of direction was challenging. The water was pooling on the playing surface in spots and the players were splashing around when they ran and, especially, when they landed on the turf. The sloppy conditions were severely limiting to both teams\u2019 offenses and probably helped the Redskins to close the competitive gap.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat weather was as bad weather as we\u2019ve played in since we\u2019ve been here,\u201d Shanahan said, \u201ccombined with that field, just how the field always is.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Jimmy Garoppolo threw for only 151 yards on 12-for-21 passing for the Niners.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played in rain my whole life,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t anything crazy.\u201d\n\nThat was just enough as Gould connected from 28, 22 and 29 yards. The San Francisco defense limited the Redskins to 154 total yards and made two big plays against tailback Adrian Peterson, stopping him on a fourth-down carry in the first half and forcing him into a second-half fumble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to be pretty,\u201d 49ers defensive tackle DeForest Buckner said. \u201cIt\u2019s the NFL. It doesn\u2019t matter who you go against. Everybody\u2019s good. You\u2019ve just got to find a way to win. That\u2019s the objective. I felt like it didn\u2019t matter. Three field goals and they didn\u2019t score? I mean, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt has, indeed, been a find-a-way-to-win type of season for the 49ers. That\u2019s precisely what they did Sunday in Landover.\n\n\u201cWe were down seven starters today,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re down seven starters, you would think, hey, you\u2019re not going to play your best football. And in a game like this, we played pretty good under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThose circumstances made the day trying and then rewarding for the 49ers.\n\n\u201cI think guys had a lot of fun, slipping and sliding out there,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cWinning is always fun.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "San Francisco improves to 6-0, and this victory is extra special for its head coach.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/q6C57Nxvd49FXYYQo9tr5khRtSI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PACYNZHTQMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
