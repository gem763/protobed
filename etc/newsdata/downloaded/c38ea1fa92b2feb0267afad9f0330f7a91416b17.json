Last week, consumer spending, the driving force in the U.S. economy, showed a slight slowdown in August. Federal data released Thursday showed services activity in the U.S. and eurozone softened in September. Investors and economists are watching Friday's planned employment-data report carefully.\n\nThe NRF and retailers have long pointed to the trade war between the U.S. and China as a potential source of economic instability, but so far that mostly hasn't translated to higher prices for consumers, Mr. Shay said Thursday on a call with reporters.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed tariffs on the majority of goods imported from China, with some to take effect later in the holiday season on consumer goods including toys and apparel. China also has imposed tariffs on some U.S. goods. Both countries have offered some concessions ahead of high-level negotiations between the countries in October. On Wednesday, the administration said it would impose tariffs on aircraft, food and other goods from the European Union.\n\n\"None of these retailers want to pass on cost to consumers if they can avoid it,\" said the retail federation's Mr. Shay. But if cost increases because of tariffs spread to more categories of goods in the coming weeks and months, he said, \"tariffs certainly could make an impact.\"\n\nWrite to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
