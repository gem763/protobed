The prime minister is hoping the bill will be passed within three days to ensure the UK stays on schedule to leave the EU on October 31st.\n\nHowever, even if MPs pass the bill and the UK leaves on time, the country will continue to be subject to decisions made by judges at the European Court of Justice (ECJ) until the end of the transition period, according to the document\u2019s wording as analysed by The Telegraph.\n\nThe WAB replaces the European Communities Act 1972, which brought the UK into what came to be known as the EU, but states that the ECJ \u201ccontinues to have effect in domestic law\u201d.\n\nExplanatory notes published with the bill explains that \u201cit will be necessary to ensure that the EU Treaties and other EU law continues to apply in the UK during the implementation period\u201d.\n\n\u201c\u2026new pieces of directly applicable EU law that are introduced during the implementation period will continue to apply automatically within the UK\u201d, it continues.\n\nVeteran Brexiteer and Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash said this contradicts the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which states: \u201cThe European Communities Act 1972 is repealed on exit day.\u201d\n\nThe implementation period \u2014 or transition period \u2014 is the timeframe after the UK has, on paper, left the EU but during which arrangements between the UK and EU will continue. During the transition, negotiators on both sides of the English Channel will work on finalising a final relationship between the UK and EU. It is notionally expected to last until December 2020 but can go on for as far as December 2022 if both sides agree.\n\nIn that time, the UK is expected to abide by all EU regulations. While it can negotiate, sign, and ratify free trade agreements with third countries like the United States, they cannot come into force until after that period has ended. That means that up to six-and-a-half years after the Brexit vote \u2014 and more than three years after Brexit day \u2014 technically the UK still will not have left all Brussels institutions.\n\nEurosceptics have warned that there were several provisions unfavourable to the UK in Theresa May\u2019s exit agreement that would still be present in Mr Johnson\u2019s deal. Besides the continued supremacy of the European Court of Justice, there is opposition to the \u00a339 billion divorce bill and continued free movement during the transition period.", "description": "The UK will still be subject to EU laws for up to three years after Brexit day under Prime Minister Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/pro-Brexit-activist-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
