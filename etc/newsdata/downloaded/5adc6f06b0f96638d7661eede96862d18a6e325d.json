You can set a timer for messages in your conversation with someone, and those will disappear after the specified time.\n\nThis feature might soon be coming to WhatsApp. According to a report by WABetaInfo, the company is testing disappearing messages on its Android app\u2019s test version 2.19.275.\n\nThe site found the disappearing message feature in WhatsApp\u2018s group chat settings. It allows you to set the timer for destruction for five seconds or one hour.\n\nDisappearing messages is a nice feature to have when you want to send sensitive information to someone and you don\u2019t want to leave behind a trace of your correspondence.\n\nCredit: WABetaInfo\n\nWe\u2019ve asked WhatsApp for more details, and we\u2019ll update the story if we hear back.\n\nRead next: Adware campaign exploits Chrome and Safari bugs to serve over 1B malicious ads", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FWhatsApp.png&signature=282880f87c69d62d26433b843008e3bf", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
