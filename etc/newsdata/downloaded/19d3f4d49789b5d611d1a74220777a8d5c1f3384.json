But what about the bus stop?\n\nGWS Living Art has also installed a green roof on the top of a bus stop in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nA green roof was also installed on the top of a bus stop in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"This initiative leverages on the same overarching idea as Garden on the Move...To replace lost greenery due to urban development and to green up under-utilized pockets of urban space,\" said Zhi Kin, of GWS Living Art.\n\nIf rolled out on bus stops across the city, the company hopes that rooftop plants could help reduce the temperature, purify the air around the bus stop and curb the risk of flash floods by absorbing stormwater. They also hope the initiative will reverse the decline of key species like bees, butterflies and birds.\n\nMalaysia is home to some of the richest biodiversity in the world. According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in Malaysia, the country has 785 known species of birds, 307 species of mammals and 2,068 species of freshwater and marine fishes.\n\nGreen cities are happier and healthier\n\nHowever, Singapore and Malaysia aren't the only countries embracing nature to tackle pollution and attract wildlife.\n\nParis plans to \"green\" 100 hectares of buildings by 2020 and London hopes to make the capital the world's first National Park City , where more than half of the city's area is green by 2050.\n\nInvesting in more green spaces does not only help the environment, but according to the World Health Organization (WHO) having access to greenery is also important to mental health.\n\nGardens by the Bay is one of Singapore's many green intiatives. The 'supertrees' act as vertical gardens, featuring tropical flowers and solar panels.\n\nWhile the United Nations estimates that around 55% of people live in cities, research shows people like to be close to nature.\n\n\"Urban is where we live, it's where we work, it's where we experience stressors, it's where we build relationships. So, having nature in our everyday surroundings is really important,\" said Kathleen Wolf, a social scientist from the University of Washington who investigates people's response to nature in cities.\n\n\"If you are in a stressed mode and you are outdoors or even just see nature through a window, your stress levels are reduced within a matter of minutes.\"", "description": "As more cities are trying to incorporate greenery into urban living, green roofs have been sprouting up on buses.", "authors": ["Stephanie Bailey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190516114956-bus-green-roof-5-super-tease.jpg"}
