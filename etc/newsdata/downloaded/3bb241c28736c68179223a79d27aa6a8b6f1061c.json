History was made when he broke the elusive barrier in a time of one hour 59 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\n\u201cI have tried, I am the first man to run under two hours to inspire many people, to tell people no human is limited,\u201d he said on the finish line. He added he wanted people to remember the positivity of sport, and to encourage more people to run. \u201cTogether we can make the world a beautiful one,\u201d he said.\n\nBy halfway, Kipchoge was on pace for the sub two time. After 30km, he ran a couple of kilometres two seconds below the target pace, but he still looked strong. Each kilometre ticked by never more than two seconds faster or slower than the required two minute 50 seconds, showing the incredible pacing. He was at times smiling as he ran. The commentators said he smiles to trick his body into thinking it is not tired.\n\nThis was the Kenyan\u2019s second attempt. In 2017, he missed the two-hour mark by 25 seconds as part of the Nike Breaking 2 project. On Saturday, he succeeded with the Ineos 1:59 Challenge. Both projects had huge teams of scientists establishing optimum conditions and tactics.\n\nThey even had meteorologists pick the exact time for the event start on a flat road course in Vienna, Austria. It was foggier and more humid than anticipated but made no odds. Kipchoge followed teams of pacers. A car drove at the exact pace needed and projected lasers on to the road for the pacers to follow. They moved in a Y formation to give Kipchoge the best draft possible. Ever few kilometres they swapped with other pacers in a graceful move that looked like synchronised swimming on tarmac.\n\nThis does not count as the world record because of the pacers, and it isn\u2019t in competition. There need to be competitors to count. Furthermore, the fact Kipchoge was handed fluids by his support team riding bikes also discounts it.\n\nThe record stands at 2:01:39, set by Kipchoge in Berlin 2018. Nonetheless, this is a huge moment in sport, akin to the first sub-four minute mile, run by Roger Bannister in 1954, or the first sub-10 second 100m sprint, run by Jim Hines at the 1968 Olympics.", "description": "The Kenyan runner was on pace from the start and has broken a barrier showing there are few limits for mankind", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/12/4661c354-ecbd-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_164733.JPG?itok=_8Oheehd&v=1570870060", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
