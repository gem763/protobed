Extinction Rebellion undermines its noble cause with such disruptive and illegal stunts.\n\nWell done to the general public for swiftly standing as one, stepping forward & closing the incident down when individuals break the law. pic.twitter.com/TKdDNiBBFZ \u2014 Tobias Ellwood MP (@Tobias_Ellwood) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cDespite our countless warnings, we are frustrated that Extinction Rebellion put people at risk to obstruct services on London\u2019s rail network,\u201d began Assistant Chief Constable Sean O\u2019Callaghan in a British Transport Police statement on the incident.\n\n\u201cThose who obstructed services are in custody and will be dealt with robustly,\u201d he claimed, before adding curiously that \u201cThis type of action is completely at odds with what Extinction Rebellion are campaigning for and we will continue to urge them to not target any rail network\u201d \u2014 which some might see as a tacit endorsement of the climate alarmist group more broadly, and even of it targeting infrastructure other than rail networks.\n\n\u201cHowever, it was also concerning to see that a number of commuters took matters into their own hands, displaying violent behaviour to detain a protester at Canning Town,\u201d complained ACC O\u2019Callaghan.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, the delay to passengers\u2019 journeys would have been annoying, but this level of response was unacceptable. We are now investigating\u2026 events at Canning Town in [their] entirety,\u201d he warned, adding that it was \u201cimportant that commuters and other rail users allow the police, who are specially trained, to manage these incidents.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Climate Protesters Climbing on London Underground Trains Physically Removed by Angry Public https://t.co/bnVEDZkhdP \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 17, 2019\n\nClaims that the public have no right to take the law \u201cinto their own hands\u201d often appear in debates on law and order, although they are somewhat at odds with Britain\u2019s historic tradition of a common law which belongs to the people \u2014 perhaps best articulated in the seventh of the late prime minister Sir Robert Peel\u2019s principles of policing, which asserts that \u201cthe police are the public and the public are the police; the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.\u201d\n\nMembers of the public do, in fact, still have a variety of common law and statutory rights to carry out citizen\u2019s arrests and lawfully detain people committing indictable and public order offences in England, subject to certain restrictions.\n\nBritish Police Investigate Catholic Woman for \u2018Hate Crime\u2019 of Using \u2018Wrong Pronoun\u2019 https://t.co/19dZuiWHhO \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 21, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Police are investigating have-a-go-heroes who stopped Extinction Rebellion protesters on the Tube, branding their actions \"unacceptable\".", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/Police-Clown.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
