Ron DeSantis failed to prove charges in suspending Israel in January.\n\n\"While the governor has offered a plethora of criticism, he has not shown that Sheriff Israel\u2019s policies, procedures or trainings on active-shooter situations were inconsistent with Florida law enforcement standards,\u201d Goodlette wrote.\n\nFLORIDA SCHOOL SHOOTING TIMELINE\n\nHe said the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, was the result of \"individual failures.\" He noted the response of school resource officer Scot Peterson, who remained outside the school while police say a gunman fired 140 rounds from an AR-15 rifle.\n\nThe gunman faces 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder.\n\nThe report is a blow to DeSantis, who suspended Israel, a Democrat, in one of his first acts as governor and replaced him with Sheriff Gregory Tony. Israel contended that his suspension was politically motivated.\n\n\"I humbly ask the Florida Senate to approve my reinstatement, so I can continue to serve all Broward County as the people's elected sheriff, Israel said in a statement, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nGoodlette didn't find that DeSantis had overreached, as Israel had contended. But he did say the governor's attorneys had failed to prove that Israel should be removed from office.\n\nIsrael sought legal fees in defending his efforts to be reinstated. Goodlette did not recommend awarding any fees.\n\nATTORNEYS FOR FLORIDA SCHOOL SHOOTING SUSPECT WANT TO QUESTION HIS MENTAL COUNSELORS ALONE\n\nThe new report will likely anger some Parkland parents, who pushed for Israel's removal following the deadly attack.\n\nIndeed, Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter was killed at the school, said, \"I feel like someone just punched me in the stomach.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIsrael also came under fire for a shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in January 2017. A gunman killed five people and wounded six others with a handgun he'd brought with him in checked luggage.\n\nFlorida's GOP-led Senate is expected to determine Israel's fate during a special session on Oct. 21. Israel has said he will run for reelection as sheriff next year.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Florida Senate official on Wednesday said\u00a0Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel be reinstated following his suspension over his department's response to last year's\u00a0Parkland school shooting that ended with 17 dead.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19268633972720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
