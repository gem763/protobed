What were the investments that meant it outperformed the UK stock market by 50 per cent in 2008? And could it pull that trick off again?\n\nRuffer\u2019s co-manager Duncan MacInnes joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter on the Investing Show to explain where the investment trust is invested now and how it positions itself to protect investors when a stock market storm becomes a hurricane.\n\nThis defensive position means that when markets are rising, Ruffer will tend to lag behind but when things turn bad it should be better placed to weather the storm.\n\nIts aim is not to match stock market performance but to deliver long-term inflation-beating returns in a less volatile manner.\n\nOver the past three years things have been tough, with just an average 3.4 per cent annual return, but taken over the longer-term it has delivered average annual gains of 7.2 per cent over ten years.\n\nDuncan tells us why what is important is not which correction it is that eventually turns into a big drop, but knowing that one eventually will - and being prepared for that.\n\nHe also talks us through where Ruffer sees opportunities, and why these like Japan and gold miners usually lie in what people would term value investments.\n\nHowever, one of the trust\u2019s top holdings is also Ocado \u2013 and he explains why the Ruffer managers believe despite its relatively high price it could still be undervalued.\n\nWeathering the storm in 2008 and profiting in 2009 set Ruffer up to outperform the FTSE All Share over the past 15 years, but could it pull that trick off again?\n\nWas the stock market sell-off overdone?\n\nInvestors suffered in October with the FTSE All Share among the global markets driven down, but was the sell-off overdone and are people too pessimistic on the prospects for UK shares?\n\nIn this part of the Investing Show, Simon Lambert, of This is Money, Richard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, and Nick Batsford, of Core London, take a look.", "description": "Ruffer says \u2018we try not to lose money in any 12 month period, and to grow the value of our investors\u2019 wealth over the long haul.\u2019 How does it do that?
