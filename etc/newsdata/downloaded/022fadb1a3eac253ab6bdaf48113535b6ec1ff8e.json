The motion - amended because of the previous vote - was approved without MPs going into the division lobbies.\n\nA vote on a cross-party amendment on preventing a no-deal referendum and holding a second referendum was also dropped.", "description": "Boris Johnson says he will put a bill on his deal to leave EU to MPs next week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7A23/production/_97176213_breaking_news_bigger.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
