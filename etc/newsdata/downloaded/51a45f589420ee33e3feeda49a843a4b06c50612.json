I found the timing interesting, given the increasing heat around the impeachment inquiry. The timing is interesting. I\u2019ll just let it go at that. And the other thing I wonder about is whether we\u2019re talking about the overall investigation of the Russia interference or are we talking about the counterintelligence investigation that was launched in July by the FBI about potential engagement or collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. What is the alleged criminal activity that prompted this?\n\nCOOPER: Do you have any idea what they might think might rise to the level of a criminal offense?\n\nCLAPPER: No, I don\u2019t. That\u2019s obviously an item of great interest to me. What is it that any of us did that would rise to the level of a criminal infraction? I just don\u2019t know.", "description": "James\u00a0Clapper said he believes he is a subject of the DOJ's newly-launched criminal investigation into origins of the Trump-Russia probe.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/08/james-clapper-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
