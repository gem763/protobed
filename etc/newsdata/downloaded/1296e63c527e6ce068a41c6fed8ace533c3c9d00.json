The lowest yield among these funds is 3.4% and each one of these funds has delivered a total return of more than 10% over the trailing 12 months.\n\nMore from Ned Piplovic: Flowers: A Baking Bet for Growth and Yield\n\nAdditionally, four of these funds have also delivered double-digit percentage total returns over the past three and five years. One of the funds has been established in 2017 and, therefore, has a performance history of only two years.\n\nVanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund Institutional Shares (VICBX)\n\nThis low-cost index fund invests in U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable securities issued by industrial, utility and financial companies. The vast majority of the fund\u2019s securities \u2014 97.4% \u2014 had maturities between five and 10 years.\n\nAs of July 31, 2019, the fund had nearly $26 billion in net assets spread across 1,784 bonds. The average net maturity was 7.5 years, with an average duration of 5.7 years and a 3.1% yield to maturity.\n\nThe fund\u2019s most recent monthly dividend distribution was $0.091. While the monthly dividend rates fluctuate based on the income payouts of the fund\u2019s underlying security, the $1.09 annualized dividend payout yields 3.56%.\n\nVanguard Emerging Markets Bond Fund Investor Shares (VEMBX)\n\nThis fund invests nearly 60% of its assets in the bonds that are issued by emerging market economies. Like other bond funds, the fund is subject to interest rate risk. Interest rates increases can reduce the prices of the fund\u2019s underlying bonds, which will reduce the fund\u2019s overall net asset value.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that bonds in emerging markets tend to have higher volatility and lower liquidity than bonds in developed countries is another risk factor to consider.\n\nAs of July 31, 2019, the fund\u2019s $285 million total net assets across 137 holdings had an average effective maturity of nearly 10 years and average duration of 6.2 years. Mexican bonds had the highest share of assets with 10.3%. Indonesia (8.2%) and Russia (6.7%) rounded out the top three countries by share.\n\nThe fund distributes dividends monthly and the current annualized dividend of $0.54 yields 4.82%. The combined total return over the trailing 12 months was nearly 13.2% and the three-year total returns are approaching 21%.\n\nSee also: Banking Bets from a Leading Value Manager\n\nVanguard Real Estate Index Fund Institutional Shares (VGSNX)\n\nThis fund invests in real estate investment trusts that purchase office buildings, hotels, and other real estate property. Because REITs often follow trends opposite from stocks and bonds, this fund can offer some portfolio diversification.\n\nWhile REIT\u2019s generally pay higher dividends, the narrow scope of this fund and potentially higher volatility are risk factors to keep in mind.\n\nAs of July 31, 2019, the fund had $65.4 billion in total net assets spread across 186 holdings with the top 10 holdings accounting for more than 42% of total assets. The fund has hiked its annual dividend eight times in the past nine years and its current $0.78 annualized dividend yields 3.8%.\n\nIncluding the dividend income, the total one-year return was nearly 13%. Additionally, the three-year total return was 16% and the five-year total return was 42%.\n\nVanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund Institutional Shares (VLCIX)\n\nThis low-cost index fund invests in U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable securities issued by industrial, utility and financial companies, with maturities greater than 10 years.\n\nLong-term bonds also tend to be more sensitive to interest-rate changes. Rising interest rates can reduce the price of bonds, which lowers the fund\u2019s share price.\n\nAs of July 31, 2019, the fund held $4.8 billion in total assets allocated across 1,994 individual bonds, with an average effective maturity of 23.7 years and an average duration of 13.8 years. More than 70% of the fund\u2019s assets are in bonds from the Industrial sector.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Investing a portion of a portfolio across several funds from the same provider, such as the best Vanguard dividend funds, can offer investors protection from market fluctuations and deliver long-term returns, explains income investing specialist Ned Piplovic, editor of DividendInvestor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
