Fitness trackers such as Fitbits or smart watches monitor heart rate using a technique called photoplethysmography. The tracker sends green light through the skin which is partially absorbed by arteries. As you exercise, these arteries expand as blood flow increases - meaning more green light is absorbed rather than reflected back to the tracker. The tracker estimates your heart rate by seeing how much light is reflected back. The amount of light that passes back through the skin to the tracker can be affected by the amount of melanin in the skin, and any tattoos.\n\n'We essentially build this massive model on how you move that is unique to you,' Dumanyan said.\n\n'From that, we create a hyper- personalized exercise plan to balance the stresses on your body and correct those imbalances.'\n\nThe devices are still in limited testing, but potential users can request access through the company's website.\n\nThe plan is to eventually launch the sensors as a full commercial release, priced at $299 plus a $29 monthly subscription.\n\nFitness trackers have been popular in recent years, but it's still unclear how accurate and effective the technology used in them is.\n\nLast year, a survey of Fitbit monitors found they recorded an accurate count of steps a person took in a day at only around 50 percent of the time.\n\nGarmin's Vivosmart 4 generated headlines earlier this year when researchers discovered some of its units gave inaccurate distance readouts, requiring runners to travel as far as 37 miles before giving them credit for having done a 26.2-mile marathon.\n\nIn 2017, a man reported having his life saved by his Apple Watch, when it alerted him to a sudden elevation in heart rate that was brought on by a blood clot, something that could have killed him without emergency medical treatment.\n\n'Never thought a stupid lil' wrist computer I bought two years ago would save my life,' Green tweeted.\n\n'Saw my heart rate go up, ended up being a pulmonary embolism'", "description": "A new wearable tech device, developed by two former student athletes at Duke University, promises to minimize injury among athletes with AI-customized training routines.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19795300-0-image-a-23_1571241626952.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
