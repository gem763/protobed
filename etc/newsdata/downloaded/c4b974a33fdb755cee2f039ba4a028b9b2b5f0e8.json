Though the initial terror of watching him drive away has passed and our son is proving to be a competent driver, we are still working out the kinks.\n\nBecause students in his high school are allowed to leave campus if they have earned high academic standing, our son has the freedom to leave campus a few times a week. This means he can learn time management skills and gain independence before leaving high school (and hang out with his buddies at a local coffee shop).\n\nIt also means it leads to situations where he comes home unannounced and scares his mother half out of her mind. Long story short: he almost met the business end of my flat iron when he stealthily climbed the stairs and yelled, \u201cSurprise! I\u2019m home!\u201d one random Tuesday morning.\n\nSuffice it to say, my husband and I have talked about installing tracking apps on our phones so that we will always know he\u2019s arrived safely to his destination. (And so he can\u2019t scare me again.)\n\nI have mixed feelings about tracking our son so closely. My parents most certainly didn\u2019t know my every move in high school and college and I have some pretty epic memories with my friends because of it. I don\u2019t want our son to feel like we don\u2019t trust him, but at the same time, when he forgets to text us that he\u2019s arrived at a friend\u2019s house, the urge to go and find him is strong.\n\nThankfully, technology has made it so that you can track your teen driver as much or as little as you feel you need.\n\nLife360\n\nBy and large, this app is the one my friends most recommended when I was asking around about tracking apps for new drivers. Not only does it have real-time tracking, Life360 can give you a location history for your kid\u2019s whereabouts. They can use the app to get help in an emergency, as well, and you can also look at their driving history to help improve driving skills.\n\nLife360 is available on both iOs and Android.\n\nFind My Friends\n\nThis app allows your kid to share their location with you temporarily or permanently, and you can see real-time movement on the road. However, this app requires that both parties share their location for the app to work, and it\u2019s a quick swipe of a button for your teen to turn location services off. But if you only want occasional tracking for certain situations, this is a good option.\n\nFind My Friends is available only on iOS.\n\nGPS phone-tracking apps\n\nOffspring Facebook group member Galen Zheng says his nuclear family shares their locations via Google Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s always been more of a \u2018just seeing if you\u2019re on your way,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI have a 14-year-old and a 10-year-old who both get themselves to school.\u201d\n\nThere are a wide range of simple-to-use GPS apps to choose from that are free for both Android and iOs devices.\n\nTeen Driving Log\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t a tracking app, per se, it\u2019s a useful app for your teen to download when they\u2019re accruing hours behind the wheel before taking their driving test. Because our state requires that teenage drivers get in a certain number of hours of practice before the exam, this app helped us keep track of hours, road conditions and types of driving in one place.\n\nThe Teen Driving Log is available only on iOS. However, a similar logging app, RoadReady, is available on both iOs and Android.\n\nDon\u2019t forget in-person communication\n\nParents should have an on-going dialogue with their teens from the beginning of their driving experience, says Brent Conly of Hickory Driving School in the United States.\n\n\u201cTalk to your teen about your expectations and the responsibilities that come with being behind the wheel,\u201d Conly says. And while yes, tracking apps are helpful for locating your child in a pinch, he says the best thing you can do to keep them safe is make sure they get plenty of instruction and practice behind the wheel.\n\n\u201cI tell parents not to be afraid to drive with their teens regularly when they have their learner\u2019s permit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a slow progression from learning to back a car out of a parking space to learning how to merge onto a highway.\u201d\n\nConly also encourages parents to talk to their child\u2019s driving instructors to understand where their deficits are when it comes to driving skills.\n\n\u201cWorking on those skills before they hit the road alone,\u201d he says, \u201cwill go a long way in helping both of you feel confident when your teen is driving solo.\u201d", "description": "Two months ago, my teenage son passed his driver\u2019s test with flying colours.
