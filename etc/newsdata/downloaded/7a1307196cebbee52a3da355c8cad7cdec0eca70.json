He is superb in the air, he is good with both feet, he can get free of his marker easily and he has a deadly shot,\u201d the Argentine coach added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve suffered against him in the past and lost against him but we\u2019ve also won against him.\u201d\n\nAtletico defender Jose Gimenez said the key to stopping Ronaldo was to limit what his team mates can do.\n\n\u201cHe is a great striker but for the ball to get to him it has to go through other players,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe fewer touches he gets of the ball, the better, so we\u2019ll try and do a good job in the middle of the pitch between the lines of midfield and attack.\u201d\n\nAtletico began the La Liga season by storm, winning their opening three games, but they entertain the Italian champions reeling from a 2-0 defeat to Real Sociedad.\n\nJuventus also had a disappointing weekend, dropping points for the first time under new coach Maurizio Sarri with a 0-0 draw at Fiorentina.\n\n\u201cWe did not play our best game against Fiorentina but we have already moved on, and tomorrow\u2019s game is an important test for us, just like every Champions League game is,\u201d said Juve defender Leonardo Bonucci.\n\n\u201cWe go into the game with a lot of enthusiasm and energy because playing in the Champions League is what you dream about. Atletico will be up for a battle tomorrow, but so will we.\u201d\n\nAtletico\u2019s former Juventus forward Alvaro Morata is an injury doubt for the game along with team mate Thomas Partey.\n\nJuve are likely to be without midfielder Miralem Pjanic through injury, while Douglas Costa, Mattia De Sciglio and Giorgio Chiellini are also ruled out.", "description": "Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone has described Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo as a goalscoring animal ahead of Wednesday's Champions League Group D game at home to the Italians.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430986462&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1V0", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
