Here's a collection of erroneous statements that advisors have heard from IRA providers and plan honchos over the years--all true stories. When you hear one of these bloomers, you know the \"expert\" you're speaking with is talking through his or her hat.\n\nFrom a 401(k) administrator to a deceased employee's son who was named as beneficiary of the plan: \"We can't roll these death benefits to an IRA for you. All we can do is give you a lump sum distribution check.\" Wrong!
