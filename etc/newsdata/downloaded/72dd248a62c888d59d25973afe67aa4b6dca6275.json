(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nMaryland offensive lineman Terrance Davis will miss four to six weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament, Coach Michael Locksley said Tuesday. The senior right guard, who is the Terrapins\u2019 most experienced lineman, was injured during the second quarter of Saturday\u2019s 20-17 loss at Temple.\n\nApart from tight end Tyler Mabry, who transferred from Buffalo, Davis has more career starts than any player on Maryland\u2019s roster.\n\nMaryland began the season with an offensive line that lacked experience after graduating three of last year\u2019s starters. The first-choice group includes redshirt freshman left tackle Jaelyn Duncan, who had never played before this season; left guard Sean Christie (27 career starts); center Johnny Jordan (nine career starts); Davis (30 career starts); and right tackle Marcus Minor (seven career starts).\n\n\u201cWe already were thin there, but when you lose a player of Terrance\u2019s caliber,\u201d Locksley said, \u201che\u2019s a three-year starter for the most part, was playing at a high level for us, it\u2019s still a next-man-up mentality.\u201d\n\n[Ralph Friedgen, back in fold with Maryland, will be honored during Penn State game]\n\nWith Davis unable to play, fifth-year offensive lineman Ellis McKennie and redshirt freshman Austin Fontaine, who converted from defensive line in the spring, could help fill the void. Locksley has referred to McKennie as a \u201csixth starter\u201d and a \u201cSwiss Army knife\u201d for his ability to play at any position on the line. McKennie started at left tackle in the season opener vs. Howard, while Duncan received the job in the next two games.\n\nIf Fontaine starts at right guard in the Penn State game on Sept. 27, it would be the first start of his career. Fontaine played some in the second half of the Temple game with Davis out. Among Maryland\u2019s offensive issues against Temple, the line allowed four sacks and the offense failed to convert a pair of fourth-and-one attempts at the goal line. Both times, running back Anthony McFarland lost yardage.\n\nDuring fall camp, Locksley said he only had seven offensive linemen \"who we feel really good about, that we can count on.\u201d Fontaine and Breyon Gaddy both moved over from defense since Locksley arrived to help provide depth.\n\n[In search of depth, Terps' offensive line leans on newcomers and converted defenders]\n\n\u201cThe depth is not necessarily where we want it to be,\u201d Locksley said Tuesday. \u201cBut we still have enough able bodies. Now we\u2019ve just got to get these guys again playing fundamentally a little cleaner than what we played on Saturday.\u201d\n\nKicker Joseph Petrino also had to exit the game with injury, leaving Maryland limited options in the kicking game. He hurt his groin but nothing is torn, Locksley said.\n\n\u201cHe has significant pain down in that area, so we\u2019re trying to let that calm down,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe won\u2019t kick him here the next couple of days to give him an opportunity to heal up.\u201d\n\nMaryland has a bye this week and won\u2019t play again until Penn State visits the following week.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland\u2019s new indoor football facility, set to be finished next year, brings program up to speed\n\nVirginia\u2019s Tony Bennett turns down pay raise, instead pledges $500,000 to career program\n\nThe Mountain West had a moment in the sun.
