He's got to learn to put that aside and just get on with the job in hand, which is playing for us.'\n\nLongstaff wants a new deal at Newcastle as reward for his first-team breakthrough, which came just weeks after signing a new contract.\n\nAnd Bruce said: 'I do believe he signed a new contract last Christmas. There is no problem there contract wise.\n\n'The thing for him now is to forget contracts, forget his knee injury, forget Man Utd, it's all about playing well for us now and getting back to playing like we know he is capable.'", "description": "The Newcastle midfielder was on the summer shortlist at Old Trafford but a \u00a350million asking price meant a deal was always unlikely and he was also recovering from knee ligament damage.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/22/19343042-0-image-a-18_1570309465102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
