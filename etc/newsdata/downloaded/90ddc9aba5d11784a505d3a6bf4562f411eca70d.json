Barcelona have the premier midfielder of the next decade. Eden Hazard In a topsy-turvy final season at Chelsea, under Maurizio Sarri, Hazard carried an often chaotic side on his shoulders, scoring 21 goals and adding 17 assists in all competitions as the Blues won the Europa League, before finally sealing his summer move to Real Madrid. Alisson The Brazilian established himself as arguably the best ball-playing goalkeeper in the world, making a series of crucial saves - none more so than against Napoli - as Liverpool clinched a sixth European Cup. Mo Salah Relentlessly effective cutting in off the right-wing, Salah scored 27 goals in all competitions as Liverpool lifted the Champions League and chased down Man City to the final game of the Premier League season. Advertisement Raheem Sterling Man City's standout player in the absence of Kevin De Bruyne, scoring 17 goals and adding 12 assists as Pep Guardiola's side clinched a third Premier League title, as well as an FA and EFL Cup. Bernardo Silva Integral to Manchester City, having helped fill the void left by the injured Kevin De Bruyne, while also an inspiration for Portugal to win the Nations League. A complete player who refuses to hide in the big moments and always makes his teammates better. Sadio Mane The understated partner to Mohamed Salah, yet quietly the more impressive over the 2018/19 season. Mane scored 22 goals in the Premier League, starred in Liverpool's Champions League win, and guided Senegal to the final of the African Cup of Nations. Cristiano Ronaldo The fears over whether Ronaldo's talents would fade beyond Madrid were quickly extinguished, scoring 21 goals in 31 games as Juventus cantered to the Serie A title, before inspiring Portugal's Nations League victory in the summer. Advertisement Virgil van Dijk The undisputed talisman of Liverpool's Champions League win, and the club's relentless title charge. The centre-back played every league game and lifted a formidable side like no few other players in Europe have managed. Lionel Messi As mercurial and peerless as ever, Messi scored 36 goals and added 15 assists as Barcelona clinched La Liga, as well as 12 goals in 10 games during the club's run to the Champions League semi-final. It seems likely that this year's Ballon d'Or will be between Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk. But there are plenty of others who will hope to make the top 30. We'll run you through some of the names here... Hello and welcome to our live coverage of today's 2019 Ballon d'Or shortlist announcement.
