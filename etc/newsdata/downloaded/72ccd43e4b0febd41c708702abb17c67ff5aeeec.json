That measure would sanction Turkish leaders, financial institutions and its energy sector, as well as prohibit any U.S. firms or individual from buying the country\u2019s sovereign debt.\n\nSenators of both parties said the deal Pence outlined doesn\u2019t do enough to protect the Kurds who fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State and have been targeted by Turkish forces seeking to occupy Syrian territory south of Turkey\u2019s border.\n\nGraham said the deal was \u201cencouraging,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t trust Erdogan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to come and hit Turkey hard if they don\u2019t get out of Syria and reset the table,\u201d Graham said. Referring to his sanctions proposal, he said he will \u201ccontinue to get co-sponsors, but this sounds positive.\u201d\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said he didn\u2019t see Pence\u2019s announcement as a win for the Kurds.\n\n\u201cFrom what I understand it\u2019s not a cease-fire,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cYou have one hundred and x number of hours to get out of here before we kill you.\u201d\n\nThe Graham-Van Hollen measure is one of four bills that have been introduced in recent days to sanction Turkey for invading northern Syria. The Trump administration had imposed some sanctions on Turkey earlier this week, but Pence said those will be re-evaluated as part of Thursday\u2019s deal with Erdogan.\n\nSpeaking with reporters Thursday, Van Hollen said it is \u201cwithin Turkey\u2019s power\u201d to avoid these sanctions by drawing back from Syrian territory that had been controlled by the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe do not want these sanctions to have to go into effect,\u201d Van Hollen said. However, he said that Congress will insist on punishing Turkey if it doesn\u2019t change course.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, who sponsored the bipartisan House sanctions bill, said his committee will continue with its work on penalties for Turkey.\n\n\u201dI am glad there is a cease fire, it\u2019s a good sign, but let\u2019s see if it lasts,\u201d Engel said. \u201dLast time I had confidence in Turkey was a long time ago.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer dismissed the deal with Turkey that Pence announced on Thursday. They said in a statement that Trump is \u201cflailing\u201d and said Erdogan has \u201cgiven up nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext week, the House will pass a strong, bipartisan sanctions package to work to reverse the humanitarian disaster that President Trump unleashed in Syria,\u201d they said. \u201cOur service members, our allies and our partners all suffering from the Syrian conflict deserve smart, strong and sane leadership from Washington.\u201d\n\nVeto-Proof Majority\n\nThe sanctions in the Graham-Van Hollen bill would be effective immediately upon enactment unless the Trump administration comes to Congress every 90 days to certify that Turkey is not operating unilaterally in Syria and has withdrawn its armed forces, including Turkish supported rebels, from areas it captured beginning on Oct. 9.\n\nThe version of the bill introduced Thursday also includes sanctions on Halkbank and any other financial institution that \u201cknowingly facilitated transactions\u201d for Turkey\u2019s military. The Trump administration has come under scrutiny for not fining Halkbank for its alleged involvement in a massive scheme to evade sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe same version of the bill would have to pass the House and the Senate before going to President Donald Trump to be signed into law. There is strong bipartisan opposition to Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria, but Senate leaders haven\u2019t committed to bringing a sanctions bill to a vote.\n\nGraham said he thinks there is enough support for the legislation to win a veto-proof majority in the Senate.\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee bill doesn\u2019t include the provision to sanction sovereign debt or that country\u2019s energy sector. That proposal does include the Halkbank sanctions, as well as penalties on senior Turkish officials and the military.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Republican and Democratic lawmakers vowed to move ahead with sanctions on Turkey despite the announcement by Vice President Mike Pence that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to temporarily halt hostilities in northern Syria.South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham and Maryland", "authors": ["Daniel Flatley", "Anna Edgerton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
