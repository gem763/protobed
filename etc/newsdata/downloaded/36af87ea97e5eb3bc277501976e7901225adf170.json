But we will keep responding, we will keep adding things.\"\n\nA $5 billion drought future fund has been established and the government is using a range of financial mechanisms to boost rural and regional economies.\n\nParliament is expected to consider legislation for new $13,000 payments for families and $7500 payments for singles before Christmas.\n\nIn a reference to a combative interview on Sydney talkback radio this week, Mr Morrison said freight and fodder subsidies were a matter for the states.\n\n\"Our job is to look after the income support to the farming families themselves.\n\n\"I don't mind giving me a whack over what they think we should be doing more of on our turf, but they've got to sort of pick the right government to have a crack at, if it's something we don't do.\"\n\nEconomist Saul Eslake said agriculture, forestry and fishing output was about 2.25 per cent of GDP.\n\nHe expected the drought to have only a small impact on the budget bottom line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"That's down from 3 per cent of GDP at the beginning of the decade. It obviously attracts a lot of attention. It will impact on exports, where farm exports are about 15 per cent of the total.\n\n\"Then there is the ongoing pressure for the government to come up with new forms or bigger forms of drought assistance.\"\n\nRainfall outlook bleak\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology's latest monthly drought statement said September rainfall remained below to very much below average for most of Australia.\n\nRainfall deficiencies continued last month, with only moderate increases in some areas. Long-term rainfall deficiencies, including record lows for some periods, continue to severely limit water resources across the Murray-Darling Basin.\n\nMajor water storages failed to replenish and water storage in the northern Murray-Darling Basin were extremely low, with no significant inflows during September.\n\nThe bureau's climate outlook for the rest of 2019 suggests a drier than average period in most of the country. The chance of exceeding median rainfall for October to December is less than 30 per cent over most of the mainland, except the north to north west of Western Australia.\n\nThe outlook suggests that near-term improvement in rainfall deficiencies is unlikely.\n\n\"The biggest source of pressure on the budget would be expectations about assistance, either to help farmers stay on the land, or in areas where droughts are becoming worse and more common, consider getting off the land,\" Mr Eslake said.", "description": "The federal government expects the drought will reduce GDP by at least 0.25 per cent through reductions in farm output.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2318%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/667ca986f9abac109181a61d8e99ebf0ddef412b", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
