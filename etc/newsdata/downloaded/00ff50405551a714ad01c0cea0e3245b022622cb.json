After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this.\n\n\u201cWe remain ready and willing to return to talks with Balpa.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, with no detail from Balpa on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of our flights.\u201d\n\nBA has spent weeks offering refunds to passengers or the option to rebook to another date of travel or an alternative airline.\n\nThe airline operates up to 850 flights a day, with most expected to be canceled, affecting up to 145,000 passengers.\n\nHeathrow airport will be worst affected as it is the busiest hub for BA.\n\nBoth sides have said they want to resume talks, but there is little or no sign of the deadlock being broken.\n\nBalpa general secretary Brian Strutton said: \u201cBritish Airways needs to wake up and realise its pilots are determined to be heard.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.\n\n\u201cBalpa has consistently offered up chances for the company to negotiate a way forward. British Airways must now put the needs of its staff and passengers first and accept that its pilots will not be bullied or fobbed off.\u201d\n\nStratton added that the union is open to negotiating a better deal for pilots that will \u201cend this dispute.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s leaders, who themselves are paid huge salaries and have generous benefits packages, won\u2019t listen, are refusing to negotiate and are putting profits before the needs of passengers and staff,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis strike will have cost the company considerably more than the investment needed to settle this dispute.\n\n\u201cIt is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute.\u201d\n\nBalpa said the strike will cost BA \u00a340 million ($49.2 million) a day, claiming the dispute could be settled for \u00a35 million ($6.15 million).\n\nBA said its offer would take the pay of some captains to more than \u00a3200,000 (nearly $246,000).", "description": "BA has offered a pay rise of 11.5% over three years but members of the pilots association wanted a bigger share of the company\u2019s profits.", "authors": ["News Reporter", "Huffpost Uk"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d762c15240000d32677c81a.jpeg?cache=uvtxb8otcg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
