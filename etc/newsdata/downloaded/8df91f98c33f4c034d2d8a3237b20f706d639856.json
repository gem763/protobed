But when she became pregnant, her goals changed. \u201cFocusing on my schoolwork was focusing on my son so that I could provide a future for him,\u201d she says.\n\nStarting in her junior year, Ms. Waldrop switched to Odyssey Online Learning, a virtual charter school in South Carolina. The flexible schedule allowed her to care for her baby and stay on top of her studies.\n\n\u201cI locked in when I got to Odyssey,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was exactly what I needed.\u201d Sure enough, Ms. Waldrop graduated as valedictorian last year.\n\nAround the country, 7,000 charter schools \u2014 public schools that typically operate independently from traditional school districts \u2014 are serving students from all walks of life and make up the fastest-growing sector of our nation\u2019s public school system.\n\nSome charter schools resemble district schools and have traditional school days. Others, like Odyssey, provide instruction online. Still others offer combination online and in-person classrooms.\n\nCharter schools have the flexibility to offer unconventional teaching methods without the bureaucratic oversight of traditional districts and burdensome teacher-union contracts. In exchange, these schools operate with more transparency to parents and taxpayers. State officials can close charter schools that don\u2019t meet academic goals or show clean financial audits each year.\n\nThese learning options have attracted the ire of unions. A recent Wall Street Journal column by a teachers union member in Los Angeles claimed charter schools\u2019 success is an illusion because they have \u201cadmission policies [that] exclude low-performing students.\u201d\n\nThat was not the case with Ms. Waldrop\u2019s charter school. Of her situation, Odyssey\u2019s principal said simply, \u201cWith all of our students, life happens.\u201d\n\nOther charters have waiting lists and must admit students by lottery. New York City\u2019s charter school lottery was made famous in the 2010 documentary \u201cWaiting for Superman.\u201d\n\nThese schools are helping students across the U.S. A 2009 study of charter schools in New York City found that students outperformed their district school peers in math and reading. Researchers found similar results in Boston among charter schools that admit students by lottery. In 2011, Mathematica researchers found positive outcomes across 15 states for students from low-income families attending inner-city charter schools with these admissions practices.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, charter schools are more likely to have higher concentrations of minority students than traditional schools, and a higher percentage of charter schools are considered high-poverty than traditional schools.\n\nThe Journal columnist claimed district schools need more money to succeed, but the charter school student achievement described above came at a discount. In large cities such as New York and Los Angeles, charter schools receive an average of $5,800 less per child than district schools, according to a recent University of Arkansas study. In fact, in The Journal contributor\u2019s home city of Los Angeles, the funding gap between traditional schools and charter schools widened from 2003 to 2016.\n\nA survey that has tracked public opinion on parent choice in education for more than a decade finds increasing support for charter schools. Interestingly, this year\u2019s survey found a sharp increase in the support from teachers.\n\nAccording to LA School Report, charter school enrollment in California has increased by 100,000 students over the past five years as the state\u2019s total public school enrollment has decreased. This is great news for children and families because a 2014 study of Los Angeles charter schools found that, on average, charter students \u201cgain an additional 50 days of learning in reading and an additional 79 days of learning in math\u201d compared with students in the district\u2019s traditional schools.\n\nAs for Ms. Waldrop, a charter school offered her a second chance, and she grabbed it. Union leaders should stop throwing stones at charter schools and join in the applause for any school that helps students succeed.\n\n\u2981 Jonathan Butcher is a senior policy analyst in the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
