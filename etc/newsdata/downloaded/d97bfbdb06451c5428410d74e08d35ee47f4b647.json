But in his spare time, he helps crack unsolved murder cases \u2014 with the help of social media and the public.\n\nJensen uses whatever video and photo might exist of the suspect or the crime scene, and creates ads on Facebook and Twitter that target people in a small geographic area, asking for any clues they may have. He'll often get a flood of potential leads.\n\nNo one hires Jensen to do this work. He often has to beg police to follow up on his leads, and he says he has gone into debt to finance the social media ad campaigns.\n\nBut Jensen says he has now helped solve 10 murder cases \u2014 which makes it all worthwhile.\n\n\"It's felt right because it worked,\" Jensen told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch. \"And how could you not?\"\n\nJensen has recently released a book, Chase Darkness with Me: How One True Crime Writer Started Solving Murders.\n\nIn it he chronicles how he learned to use social media to help solve murders, how police and citizen detectives can use his methods, and how he helped write the book that elevated the case of the Golden State Killer .\n\nFrom cold cases to solving crimes\n\nJensen was a crime reporter and investigative journalist for decades, and he was always interested in writing about the unsolved cases.\n\n\"I used to say, 'I hate the guy that got away with it,'\" he said. \"That's the reason why I do this.\"\n\nIt was that interest that led him to befriend writer Michelle McNamara. She was working on a book about a series of unsolved murders and rapes in California in the 1970s and 80s, coining the name \"Golden State Killer\" for the then-unknown culprit during her investigation.\n\nJoseph James DeAngelo, known as the Golden State Killer.

He was tired of writing about unsolved cases, fed up with seeing families with no closure, and investigators and citizen detectives come up against dead ends.\n\n\"And there's this guy [the murderer] selfishly sitting in a corner knowing the answer,\" he said.\n\nHe needed to find a new method to solve the crimes himself.\n\nSheriff's crime scene tape surrounds the house belonging to Joseph James Deangelo, who was arrested for the East Area Rapist/Original Night Stalker/Golden State Killer case in Citrus Heights, California, U.S., April 25, 2018.

Gaines, who was earlier attacked by an unknown assailant, was lying unconscious on the road before he was hit.\n\nSuveillance video of the attack was shot from above, making it difficult to identify the assailant.\n\nMichelle McNamara, right, pictured here with her husband, comedian Patton Oswalt, made it her mission to find the person responsible for at least 12 murders and 50 rapes throughout California in the 1970s and 80s. She died in April 2016. On April 25, 2018, authorities said a DNA match led them to arrest Joseph James DeAngelo, a 72-year-old former police officer, as a suspect. (Matt Sayles/Associated Press)\n\nJensen created a Facebook page dedicated to the case, and posted ads on Twitter that targeted people in the immediate area. Eventually, someone sent him a photo and video that showed the attack from the front, so that the assailant's face could clearly be identified.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" said Jensen.\n\nHe took the information to Chicago police \u2014 but, he said, they did nothing. \"They just said thank you. That's it,\" he said.\n\nSo Jensen kept on the case.\n\nHe identified a suspect named Marcus Moore, and began following him on social media.\n\nJensen eventually discovered that Moore was staying with his brother, who lived in Minneapolis, and was in a relationship with a woman from Minnesota. Everything was lining up.\n\n\"I'm begging with the police: 'He's in Minnesota. He's at his brother's house,'\" Jensen said.\n\nIt took five months, but eventually U.S. marshals arrested Moore in Minnesota, just as Jensen had predicted.\n\nFinding a fugitive\n\nJensen realized he had a formula that he could replicate. So he began looking for other cases.\n\n\"As soon as it's solved, it's always, 'Let's go to the next one,\" he said. \"There's 220,000 unsolved murders in America since 1980. There's always going to be a next one.\"\n\nSome cases, he said, are like \"finding a needle in a haystack.\"\n\nOnce, for example, a San Jose police officer asked for Jensen's help finding a fugitive who had committed a murder.\n\nAll police knew about the man's whereabouts was that he was in Mexico \u2014 far too large a place to effectively geo-target with ads.\n\nSunil Tripathi, 22, who had been missing since mid-March, was misidentified by online sleuths as one of the Boston bombers. (Brown University/Associated Press, File)\n\nBut then the officer showed him a photo of the man. He was very pale, had red hair, and didn't speak English.\n\n\"This guy is gonna stick out like a sore thumb,\" Jensen recalled.\n\nSo he placed Spanish-language ads on social media asking for information about the man. He honed in on two beach towns, focusing on areas near American bars like Hooters.\n\nWithin hours, messages started pouring in from people who told him they had seen the suspect. Those ads helped police to track the man, Jensen said, and, six months later, they finally caught him.\n\nEthical questions about crowdsourcing for murders\n\nCrowdsourcing to solve crimes, particularly using digital imagery, present some very serious ethical questions.\n\nPeople have been misidentified through images as perpetrators of crimes they did not commit, such as in the high-profile case of Sunil Tripathi, a university student misidentified by amateur online sleuths as one of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers. Tripathi had gone missing one month before the bombing.\n\nJensen said anyone attempting the kind of citizen detective work he advocates must follow a simple rule: \"You don't name names in public,\" he said.\n\n\"If you find something, you go to the authorities.\"\n\nJensen said many amateur sleuths want to publicly name people they think are suspects because \"they want to look smart, or they want to get credit.\"\n\nInstead, he said, \"they're ruining people's lives.\"\n\n\"If you can stay away from that, you can stay away from those miscarriages of justice.\"\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
