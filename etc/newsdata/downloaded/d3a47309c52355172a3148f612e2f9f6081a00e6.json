The goal for the opposition in local elections on Sunday is to win back at least some momentum. If the unified opposition candidate can take back control of the capital Budapest from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, it would be a rare setback for Hungary\u2019s anti-migration prime minister, who has talked about a project to reshape the country by 2030.\n\nPolls suggest the races will be close. But in both countries the ruling parties, which have drawn ire from the European commission and rights organisations, look the more likely to win. The opposition has also been criticised for fractious infighting and political own goals that have not helped their chances in either country in recent years.\n\nIn Poland, the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has the support of more than 40% of Poles, according to most surveys. PiS won elections in 2015 and has embarked on a programme of massive social spending, winning widespread support.\n\nThe Guardian view on Poland\u2019s election: church-sanctioned bigotry casts a shadow | Editorial Read more\n\nSimultaneously, the party has been accused of attacking the judiciary, engaging in a culture war and, in recent months, using its stable of loyal media to launch a war on \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d, claiming the party is defending true, traditional Polishness.\n\nOpposition parties have no illusions that PiS will be the biggest party, but there is some hope that it will not be able to form a government, and that liberal and leftist opposition forces could govern as a broad coalition. Due to the complicated arithmetic in the Polish system, a lot could depend on whether two smaller parties, one of them from the far right, make it past the 5 per cent threshold for entry into parliament.\n\nMuch of the support for PiS comes from smaller towns and the countryside, where the social spending has made an impact.\n\n\u201cWe know how to convince people in the big cities, our problem is how to convince people in the rural areas in the south and east, especially when there\u2019s such an impact of government propaganda,\u201d said Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw and member of the Civic Coalition opposition.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The mayor of Warsaw, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, with Sadiq Khan during the London\u2019s mayor visit to the Polish capital last month.

Going into this vote, the prime ministerial candidate from the liberal Civic Coalition, Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska, has used the slogan: \u201cCooperation not quarrelling\u201d.\n\nHowever, Civic Coalition has been criticised for failing to articulate a message that could appeal to swing voters rather than simply its core vote. \u201cI\u2019m trying to support them but it\u2019s really hard, they can\u2019t even present their own programme properly,\u201d said Katarzyna Kasia, a philosophy professor and contributor to the Kultura Liberalna journal. \u201cYou can\u2019t build a political strategy on saying PiS is horrible. It\u2019s important, but there has to be more of a message.\u201d\n\nIn Poland, there are still plenty of opposition-friendly news outlets and a vibrant political debate. In Hungary, Orb\u00e1n is further down the road towards full control, having suffocated much of the country\u2019s independent media and implemented a kind of crony capitalism, all the while pumping out daily messaging warning Hungarians their lives are at risk from Muslim migrants.\n\nProfile Viktor Orb\u00e1n Show Hide Born in 1963 in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in central Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been leader of the Fidesz national conservative party in two long stints since 1993. He has been Hungary\u2019s prime minister between 1998 and 2002, and again since 2010. After two years of military service he studied law in Budapest, and then political science at Pembroke College, Oxford.\n\nFor nationalists across Europe, Orb\u00e1n has become a hero, the embodiment of a nativist leader willing to eschew liberal political correctness and speak aggressively about the need to defend so-called Christian Europe. Steve Bannon has called him Trump before Trump, and Nigel Farage and Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini are admirers.\n\nFor many liberals, and increasingly for some of his supposed allies in the EPP, he signifies all that is rotten, corrupt and downright scary in contemporary politics on the continent. \u201cThe age of liberal democracy is at an end,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told the Hungarian parliament shortly after Fidesz won a third successive electoral victory in 2018. \u201cIt is no longer able to protect people\u2019s dignity, provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture.\u201d His messaging, repeated in speeches and interviews ad nauseam, is that he is on a mission to protect Hungary and the rest of Europe from the evils of migration from the Middle East and Africa. He has frequently accused the Hungarian-born financier George Soros of a conspiracy to overrun Europe with Muslim migrants. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament, which gives him leeway to make sweeping constitutional changes, and he has spoken of a plan to reshape the country over the next decade. He has installed loyalists in previously independent institutions, put a vast media network under the control of cronies and brushed off protests from the disgruntled urban elites. One thing Orb\u00e1n\u2019s admirers and detractors agree on is that he has become symbolic of something bigger than the fate of a smallish central European state with a population of fewer than 10 million. The man himself clearly relishes his increasingly large role in European political discourse. Frustrated with Brussels and other European critics, Orb\u00e1n has built alliances with neighbouring countries, notably throughout the V4, which comprises Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all of whose leaders have at times expressed varying degrees of unhappiness with the EU, and whose unity in messaging is growing. For Orb\u00e1n, the idea that he is up against an exhausted, decaying vision of Europe is one that he has returned to again and again in his speeches. In October 2018, he implicitly compared today\u2019s EU to the Nazis, Soviets and other imperial powers.

For the first time since Orb\u00e1n came to power in 2010, the opposition has managed to coordinate efforts and run single candidates in many races.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A billboard urging voters to back Gergely Kar\u00e1csony in the Budapest mayoral race.

Here, the opposition forces have united around 44-year-old Gergely Kar\u00e1csony. The run-up to the vote has been lively, with spoiler candidates, police searches of an opposition office and dirt leaked anonymously on candidates from both sides of the divide.\n\nKar\u00e1csony\u2019s office was bugged and recordings in which he discussed politicians from other opposition parties were leaked. \u201cIt makes you feel like you are in Moscow,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Poland, the opposition looks at how Orb\u00e1n has cemented control over the last decade and wonders nervously if the country might be on the same path.\n\n\u201cThis is not a normal election because values and institutions are at stake. This is an existential choice,\u201d said Trzaskowski.", "description": "Polish elections and local polls in Hungary offer chance to claw back ground from nationalists", "authors": ["Shaun Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfc570000da23ff79ae7415575cc776955aa63c0/0_212_5757_3454/master/5757.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d98c4b864fc6137c53729663a575b77a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
