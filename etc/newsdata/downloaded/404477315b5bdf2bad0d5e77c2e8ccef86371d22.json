Then, after reading the stories, the thunder struck the lightning bolt. Americans can be such hypocrites, and I couldn\u2019t be silent.\n\n\u201cShoosh,\u201d as Big Mama would say. \u201cThis is \u2018Merica, and in \u2018Merica we have the right to free speech.\u201d\n\nWe do, indeed, and that\u2019s why Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey is one of my heroes of the week for tweeting that we Americans, here and abroad, should support the protesters in Hong Kong demanding the basic human right to speak their minds.\n\nChina is one of those nations that wants everyone to speak from the same script \u2014 or else.\n\nMr. Morey apologized for airing his views online after the NBA said he doesn\u2019t speak for the league and he doesn\u2019t speak for the Rockets, either. In fact, the PR mouthpiece for the Rockets even shut up two of the league\u2019s most prolific players, James Harden and Russell Westbrook, an on-court duo Big Mama dubbed \u201cThundah and Lightnin.\u2019\n\nAt any rate, they were told to shoosh, too.\n\nMeanwhile, analyst and Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, who once played for the Rockets, took on the critics.\n\n\u201cThey have billions of dollars at stake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business decision. I understand the NBA. The players and the owners both got billions of dollars at stake.\u201d\n\nThose who do not understand that, Mr. Barkley added, are \u201cidiots and jackasses and fools.\u201d\n\nWell, that was enough to untie Big Mama\u2019s apron strings, and have a one-on-one with Sir Charles. Mr. Barkley may understand \u201cthe money thang,\u201d but he clearly fails to see the \u201cimpo\u2019tant picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharles,\u201d she said, \u201cyou get to say \u2018bout anythin\u2019 you wanna. Yet you think tha\u2019 NBA should shoosh what they don\u2019t wanna hear. That ain\u2019t A-mer-I-can.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub.\n\nMr. Barkley and others who side with the NBA for stuffing cotton in the mouths of officials and players forget not only America\u2019s history, they forget that schools like Auburn University, Mr. Barkley\u2019s alma mater, didn\u2019t even integrate until 1968.\n\nThey also forget, or perhaps never learned, that the NBA itself didn\u2019t allow its first black player until 1959.\n\nSo, the problem isn\u2019t solely how the Chinese government treats its citizens. It\u2019s how Americans treat other Americans.\n\nAmericans telling other Americans to shoosh is un-American, a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nBig Mama is very mindful of the warnings following 9/11 and the other traumatic incidents: \u201cIf you see something, say something.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why she spoke up about the NBA-China issue, and the first word out of her mouth was \u201cShoosh.\u201d\n\nShe wants to know if you even care about free speech.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
