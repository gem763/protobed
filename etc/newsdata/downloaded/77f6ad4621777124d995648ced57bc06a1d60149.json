And CBP had 19,000 people in custody at one point, in processing facilities built to hold somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000. The number is now less than 4,000, Mr. Morgan said.\n\nHe said the improvements came with little help from Congress, which approved money to help improve some detention conditions but has been unable to pass legislation to stem the flow of people.\n\nInstead, it was the Trump administration that took steps, signing agreements with the three Central American countries most responsible for the flow of illegal immigrant families, and working with Mexico to try to prevent folks from reaching the U.S. border.\n\nOne major move was the administration\u2019s Migration Protection Protocols, dubbed the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, which takes would-be asylum seekers who crossed through Mexico en route to the U.S. and sends them back across the border to wait while their cases are heard in the U.S.\n\nMr. Morgan said 51,000 migrants have been in the MPP since it began earlier this year, and President Trump brags about the thousands of troops he cajoled Mexico to deploy to its borders.\n\n\u201cThe cooperation and partnership we have with Mexico right now is one for the history books,\u201d Mr. Morgan said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
