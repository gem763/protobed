We\u2019d meet up at the private terminal at Barajas and Beckham would be off god knows where, Figo and Zidane would be off somewhere or other, Ronaldo and me\u2026 and we always had to train the day after tomorrow.\n\n'I used to pray for Saturday fixtures so I could go to the Formula 1 on Sunday. It was private jets all over the place. It was crazy.'\n\nThe defender had a fondness for Formula One and used to attend races on his free Sundays\n\nCarlos sits with David Beckham and his wife Victoria during the ATP Madrid Masters in 2003\n\nAt the Bernabeu, Carlos found himself playing alongside one of his close friends Ronaldo, whom he first met while on international duty in 1993.\n\nHaving built up such a close relationship over the years, the former Inter defender admits he spent more time with the striker than he did with his other half, admitting: 'I met Ronaldo in 1993 and from that moment we always shared the room. I\u2019ve slept more times with Ronaldo than my wife.'\n\nAnother story told by Carlos demonstrates the power held by the players at that time during the presidential reign of Florentino Perez.\n\nCarlos revealed he started rooming with close friend Ronaldo from 1993 while team-mates\n\nCarlos was part of a star-studded Real Madrid side (top row from left) Iker Casillas, Ivan Helguera, Ronaldo, Esteban Cambiasso, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, (bottom row from left) Michel Salgado, Beckham, Roberto Carlos, Raul, Raul Bravo;\n\nVanderlei Luxemburgo was brought in to coach Real Madrid at the start of the 2004 season.\n\nHowever, after rubbing players up the wrong way, he was quickly dismissed, as Carlos explains.\n\n'In the second game of the league season we had the custom of leaving our bags in the hotel and going for a beer or a wine before dinner.\n\n'There were always two bottles of wine on the table. Ronaldo and me told him [Luxemburgo]: \"Professor, people here have their habits, you\u2019ll see what they are, but don\u2019t try to change them. Don\u2019t take the wine off the table or stop the beers before dinner or you\u2019ll find yourself with a problem.\"\n\n'What did he do? First he took away the wine, then he banned the beers. He lasted three months. Football is a small world, the directors heard about it and it was \u201cadios\u201d.'\n\nVanderlei Luxemburgo attempted to change players' habits when he joined Real as head coach", "description": "Real Madrid icon Roberto Carlos has lifted the lid on life as a Galactico, painting a picture of jetsetting and player-power at the heart of the most notorious era at any club in modern football.", "authors": ["Harry Slavin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19538994-0-image-a-43_1570711431122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
