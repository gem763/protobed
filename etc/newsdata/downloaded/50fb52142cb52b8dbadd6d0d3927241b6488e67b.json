It had also been forecast by tech experts.\n\nEarlier this month, a Hong Kong engineer wrote in a blog that she had discovered prototype code in Facebook's Android app which suggested that it was testing the setting. Facebook declined to comment at the time.\n\nInstagram has not made public any data from its trial in seven countries: Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Italy and Ireland.\n\nThe change prompted backlash from some social media influencers who said that displaying likes was an important business metric for them.\n\nThe platforms have not said whether the trials will be extended or become permanent.\n\nYou might also be interested in:", "description": "It follows a similar and controversial trial by Instagram and is designed to ease social pressure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9FEA/production/_108983904_gettyimages-1167455386.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
