The Astros have won six straight and already secured a playoff spot.\n\nAltuve sent Jaime Barria\u2019s fifth pitch into the left field seats to spark a five-run first inning, which also included Bregman\u2019s 38th homer and Correa\u2019s first connection after missing nearly a month with a sore back - this was his second game since returning. Aledmys D\u00edaz followed Correa with a double and scored on Josh Reddick\u2019s single to make it 5-0.\n\nZack Greinke (17-5) retired his first six batters before Kevan Smith hit his first pitch of the third inning into the bullpen in right-center to cut the lead to 5-1.\n\nCorrea\u2019s second homer came with one out in the bottom of the inning to put Houston up 6-1.\n\nAndrelton Simmons hit a two-run single in the fourth and Smith scored him to pull Los Angeles within two.\n\nGreinke yielded seven hits and four runs in five innings to win his third straight decision. Greinke has won seven of eight decisions since a trade from Arizona on July 31. He didn\u2019t walk anyone for the fourth straight start, which is the longest streak of his career.\n\nRoberto Osuna allowed one hit in a scoreless ninth for his 36th save.\n\nBarria (4-10) allowed eight hits and six runs in 2 2/3 innings to drop his seventh straight decision.\n\nAltuve\u2019s home run was his 30th this season and gives the Astros four players with at least 30 for the first time. Along with Altuve and Bregman, George Springer (35) and Yuli Gurriel (30) have also reached the mark.\n\nBregman\u2019s 38 homers are the most by an Astro since Lance Berkman hit 45 in 2006.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAngels: OF Mike Trout had surgery to remove a growth from his right foot Friday in California, and manager Brad Ausmus said he texted with him and that he was feeling good. Trout last played Sept. 7 and the team announced that his season would end early because of the problem with his foot.\n\nAstros: All-Star reliever Ryan Pressly was activated from the injured list Friday after missing a month after having arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Pressly struck out two in a scoreless seventh. \u2026 Gurriel was out of the lineup on Friday because of a stomach ailment.\n\nLANGSTON HOSPITALIZED\n\nAngels radio broadcaster Mark Langston had a medical emergency Friday night and was taken to a hospital where he was alert and undergoing testing. The 59-year-old Langston pitched in the majors for 16 seasons, including eight for the Angels.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: LHP Patrick Sandoval (0-3, 4.91 ERA) will start for Los Angeles on Saturday night. Sandoval allowed two hits and one run in four innings but did not factor in the decision in a 6-4 win over Tampa Bay on Sunday.\n\nAstros: LHP Wade Miley (14-5, 3.71) is scheduled to start for Houston on Saturday. Miley yielded seven hits and two runs in six innings for a win against Kansas City in his last start.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carlos Correa hit two home runs, Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman also connected and the Houston Astros dropped their magic number to clinch the AL Central to one by beating the Los Angeles Angels 6-4 Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/angels_astros_baseball_19391_c0-306-3042-2079_s1770x1032.jpg?d4c17e6bec6d52b83d6b4cb4342afa57a1601461", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
