In the kitchen, use unflavoured, unwaxed floss to tie up a chicken or roast. It\u2019s also great for slicing soft cheeses, watermelon and cake. (And really, who has a cheese wire these days?) You can also use it to scrape stuck-on baked goods out of the pan.\n\nIf you find yourself in sudden need of a new shoelace, dental floss can do the trick.
