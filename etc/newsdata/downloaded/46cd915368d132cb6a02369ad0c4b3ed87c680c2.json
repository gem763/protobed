The company is guilty of handling user's data poorly itself as it was recently discovered to be employing human contractors to transcribe user's Skype conversations.\n\nEarlier this year, news of Microsoft Research's Project Bali broke and it was revealed that the company was privately testing a new way to give users greater control over the data collected about them online.\n\nData dignity\n\nChief scientist at Microsoft, Jaron Lanier was the central focus of a recently published interactive feature in The New York Times in which he used the term \u201cdata dignity\u201d to describe his plan for correcting the imbalance between users and businesses when it comes to the collection of their data.\n\nSearching for the term \u201cdata dignity\u201d lead ZDNet to discover a site called \u201cThe Art of Research\u201d and the organization says it is embedded in the CTO office of Microsoft under Lanier's leadership. The organization's about page also gives further insight into Microsoft's new Data Dignity team, saying:\n\n\u201cOur project re-imagines how people can control how their data is used and by whom, how data creators of all kinds can unionize, and how all this activity will grow the data labor market, for the benefit both of individuals and of technology that cannot exist without quantities of high-quality data. There is currently a flurry of burgeoning activity surrounding data as labor. In early 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom announced a proposed \u201cData Dividend\u201d for California. Here at Microsoft, we have a brand new Data Dignity team headed by Christian Liensberger (now hiring!).\u201d\n\nAccording to a Microsoft job posting, the Office of the CTO is currently working on making deep learning \u201clegible,\u201d applying mixed reality to the practical use of deep learning and data dignity.\n\nMicrosoft has yet to make a formal announcement regarding its new Data Dignity team but expect to hear more as the software giant continues to position itself as a champion of user privacy.\n\nWe've also highlighted the best VPN services of 2019\n\nVia ZDNet", "description": "Users have been tricked into giving away their data for too long and Microsoft is planning to do something about it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cq549vNncukg9YTBwPtCGa-1200-80.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
