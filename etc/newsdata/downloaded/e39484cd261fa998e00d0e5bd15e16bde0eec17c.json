REUTERS/Jim Young/Pool\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Friday, hours after Turkey agreed with the United States to pause its offensive on Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nTurkey launched its assault against the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria last week after President Donald Trump pulled a U.S. contingent out of the way, creating a new front in Syria\u2019s eight-year war and prompting 200,000 civilians to take flight.\n\nIsrael sees Syria\u2019s Kurds, once U.S. allies, as a counterweight to Islamist insurgents in northern Syria.\n\nIt worries militants aligned with its arch-foe Iran could fill the vacuum left by a disengaged United States.\n\nThe Kurds responded to the U.S. withdrawal by inviting Syrian government forces, backed by Moscow and Tehran, into towns and cities in areas they control.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent diplomatic outreach to Tehran, in parallel to his firing of hawkish National Security Adviser John Bolton, also gave Israelis pause.\n\nThursday\u2019s truce, brokered in Ankara by a U.S. team including Pompeo and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, gives Kurdish forces five days to withdraw from a \u201csafe zone\u201d Ankara had sought to capture.\n\nPompeo\u2019s visit on the heels of the ceasefire was widely seen in Israel as an attempt to assuage Israeli concerns that a U.S. force drawdown could expose it to attacks by Iran or its proxies.\n\nLater on Friday, Pompeo will fly to Brussels for a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Friday, hours after Turkey agreed with the United States to pause its offensive on Kurdish forces in Syria.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442221737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0PY", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
