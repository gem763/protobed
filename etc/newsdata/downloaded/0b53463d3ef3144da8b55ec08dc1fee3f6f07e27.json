If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Rocky Mountain Dealerships's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Rocky Mountain Dealerships\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Rocky Mountain Dealerships paid out 95% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Rocky Mountain Dealerships generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 33% of its free cash flow in the past year.\n\nIt's good to see that while Rocky Mountain Dealerships's dividends were not well covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if this were to happen repeatedly, we'd be concerned about whether the dividend is sustainable in a downturn.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nTSX:RME Historical Dividend Yield, September 7th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Rocky Mountain Dealerships's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 8.4% a year over the previous 5 years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Rocky Mountain Dealerships has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Rocky Mountain Dealerships is already paying out 95% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Rocky Mountain Dealerships? It's not a great combination to see a company with earnings in decline and paying out 95% of its profits, which could imply the dividend may be at risk of being cut in the future. However, the cash payout ratio was much lower - good news from a dividend perspective - which makes us wonder why there is such a mis-match between income and cashflow. Bottom line: Rocky Mountain Dealerships has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Readers hoping to buy Rocky Mountain Dealerships Inc.
