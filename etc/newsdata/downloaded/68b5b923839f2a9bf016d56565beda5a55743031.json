ARM\u2019s continued supply of chip technology to Huawei\u2019s fully-owned chipmaker HiSilicon will ease the pressure it faces.\n\nHuawei\u2019s proprietary chips such as Kirin 990 mobile processors and Ascend 910 AI chipset are built on ARM\u2019s design architecture and considered a major hallmark of the Chinese firm\u2019s attempts to reduce its reliance on U.S. technologies.\n\n\u201cARM\u2019s v8 and v9 are UK-origin technologies,\u201d an ARM spokeswoman told Reuters via email on Friday.\n\n\u201cARM can provide support to HiSilicon for the ARM v8-A architecture, as well as the next generation of that architecture, following a comprehensive review of both architectures, which have been determined to be of UK origin.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government alleges that Huawei is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy. Huawei has repeatedly denied its products pose a security threat.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Huawei's newly launched Taishan series of ARM server, powered by the new Kunpeng chipsets is seen during a launch event at the Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China January 7, 2019.
