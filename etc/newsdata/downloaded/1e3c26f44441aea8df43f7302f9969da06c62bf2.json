AP\n\nThey did not want Mr Johnson to campaign on his crowning achievement of having gotten the country out of the 28-nation bloc.\n\nLawmakers could still bring significant changes to Mr Johnson's bill. Opposition parties are still squabbling over which day in early December is best for an election and whether to allow settled European Union citizens a vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the legislation enacting the Brexit deal has been put on hold, pending an election, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who oversees the government's legislative agenda in the House of Commons, said.\n\nThe first Christmas election in Britain since 1923 would be highly unpredictable: Brexit has variously fatigued and enraged swathes of voters while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major parties, Conservative and Labour.\n\nUltimately, voters would have a choice between an emboldened Mr Johnson pushing for his Brexit deal or a socialist government under Mr Corbyn renegotiating the deal before a referendum.\n\nIf no party wins conclusively, the Brexit deadlock will continue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think we\u2019ve just got to bring this to some sort of resolution. We\u2019ve had many votes in the last 12 months in parliament and I think a general election might be a way to sort it all out,\" one commuter, Matt Finch, 36, told Reuters outside the capital's Charing Cross rail station.\n\nWhile almost all British politicians agree that an election is needed, Mr Johnson's opponents want to inflict maximum political damage by preventing his last-minute deal from being ratified before the poll.\n\nMr Johnson, in turn, is trying to shift the blame for failing to deliver Brexit by October 31 on to parliament.\n\n\"We will not allow this paralysis to continue and, one way or another, we must proceed straight to an election,\" Mr Johnson told parliament on Monday. \"This House cannot any longer keep this country hostage.\"\n\nSuch is the lack of trust in parliament that lawmakers are squabbling about almost everything from the sequencing of Brexit to the exact date of the election.\n\nBehind the bickering, though, Johnson is closer to an election than he has ever been in his tumultuous three-month premiership.\n\n\"We won't accept any jiggery-pokery from the prime minister,\" Ian Blackford, the Scottish National Party's Westminster leader, said. \"Our vote certainly can't be taken for granted.\"\n\nMr Johnson's Conservatives are ahead of Labour by an average of about 10 percentage points in polls this month, though pollsters underestimated the support for Brexit in 2016 and admit that the models they use are wilting beside the Brexit furnace.\n\nWhen Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, bet on a snap election in 2017, she lost her slender majority - a failure that ultimately prevented her from ratifying her Brexit deal and sank her political career.\n\nReuters", "description": "The stage is set for Britain to go to the polls before Christmas after Jeremy Corbyn said the conditions had been met for Labour to support an early election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3549%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_191/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a8c4345aa35a92e5718e776989c5aa4157397874", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
