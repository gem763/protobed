Blizzard also fired both casters for good measure.\n\nIn an official blog post, Blizzard said:\n\nGrandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone Esports and we take tournament rule violations very seriously. After an investigation, we are taking the necessary actions to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\nIt is important to note that Blizzard is partly owned by the monolithic Chinese multinational conglomerate, Tencent Holdings Limited. Today, Tencent also announced a suspension of their ties with the National Basketball Association, after Houston Rockets\u2019 General Manager tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nJust like the NBA, Blizzard is facing a pervasive negative response from the public. Customers are boycotting the company, and declaring their support for Chung and the pro-democracy demonstrators through the #BoycottBlizzard hashtag \u2014 including numerous posted screenshots showing Blizzard products deleted from their personal computers.\n\nThe response has been so intense that Blizzard has even shut down r/Blizzard, the company\u2019s official fan subreddit, in an attempt to silence the overwhelming criticism. Meanwhile, fellow online card game \u201cGods Unchained\u201d has decided to express their support for Chung by paying out all of his lost winnings:\n\n.@Blizzard_Ent just banned @blitzchungHS and stripped his Hearthstone winnings because they care about money more than freedom. We will pay for ALL his lost winnings and a ticket to our $500k tournament: no player should be punished for their beliefs. #freegaming https://t.co/ONvtkG4x9G \u2014 Gods Unchained (@GodsUnchained) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201c@Blizzard_Ent just banned @blitzchungHS and stripped his Hearthstone winnings because they care about money more than freedom,\u201d they tweeted early this morning. \u201cWe will pay for ALL his lost winnings and a ticket to our $500k tournament: no player should be punished for their beliefs. #freegaming\u201d\n\nEven Blizzard\u2019s employees may be feeling the heat. Unconfirmed reports claim that \u201cincensed\u201d employees have covered up the \u201cThink Globally\u201d and \u201cEvery Voice Matters\u201d values from the company\u2019s corporate display.\n\nWithout any real chance of a South Park style \u201capology\u201d from the communist corporate overlords, Blizzard is betting on silence being their best chance of escape\u2026\n\nIt is not working.", "description": "Blizzard is facing backlash from consumers angry that the company banned Hearthstone Grandmaster\u00a0Ng Wai \u201cblitzchung\u201d Chung.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hong-kong-protester-arrest-baton-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
