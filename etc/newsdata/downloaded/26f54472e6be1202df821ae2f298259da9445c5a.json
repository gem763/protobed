Does your mutt become a maniac at every flash she sees?\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that most animals hate fireworks, and it\u2019s no surprise given they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But there are also some other reasons.\n\nA spokesperson for Pure Pet Food explained: \u2018Animals have heightened senses and their hearing in particular is much stronger than ours. A dog\u2019s hearing is twice as sensitive as a human\u2019s for example, and a cat\u2019s three times!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best thing you can do is keep your pets indoors, but even this isn\u2019t always enough to ensure they\u2019re free from stress.

These can played via YouTube, or through a number of sleep apps.\n\nLet them hide\n\nYour pet might choose to hide under the bed or behind other furniture, but don\u2019t even try and tempt them out, as this could cause them more stress.\n\nHowever, if they come to you for comfort, make sure you give it them.\n\nAct normal\n\nTry to act as normal, as your pet will pick up on any unusual behaviour. Be calm, happy and cheerful as this will send positive signals to your pet.\n\nCompany\n\nAvoid leaving your pet alone when fireworks are going off near your house, and if you do have to leave, don\u2019t get angry with your pet if you find they\u2019ve been destructive or messed in the house \u2013 shouting at a frightened pet will only make them more stressed.\n\nMORE: There\u2019s a bank that gives out ice cream with an ATM that dispenses free toppings\n\nMORE: Man sick of daily grind and city living quits job to climb all 1,001 mountains in the UK and Ireland\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Fireworks night can be scary to dogs, so we've got some ways for you to make things run a lot smoother.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1170177519_1571928002.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
