Two minutes prayer, visualization, meditation for those in the way of the storm.\"\n\nAfter reporter Yashar Ali tweeted that post, Williamson accused him of trying to \"debunk, counter or mischaracterize anything I do.\"\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON WARNS OF 'DARK PSYCHIC FORCE' OF TRUMP IN VIRAL DEBATE MOMENT\n\n\"Would you like to have an honest and fair public dialogue? Since I'm neither crazy, irresponsible nor dangerous, I would appreciate the opportunity to counter the caricature,\" she said.\n\nAli seemed baffled by Williamson's response, writing in turn: \"Not sure why this tweet provoked your frustration @marwilliamson. I simply noted that you deleted a tweet.\"\n\n\"I did not editorialize,\" he added before knocking her lack of support among Democrats. \"With respect to your offer to have an [sic] 'public dialogue,' thank you but I am reserving my time to speak to candidates who qualified for the debate.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Williamson seemed to deny that she claimed that \"power of the mind\" affected Hurricane Dorian's path.\n\nIn a statement provided to Fox News, her campaign claimed the statement was a \"metaphor\" and pointed to other tweets the candidate posted on prayer.\n\n\"It was a metaphor,\" the statement read. \"When others speak of prayer and the mind it\u2019s considered profound, but Marianne is held to a different standard. Because the comment led to confusion it was replaced.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Everyone please pray for the people of the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. May the peace of God be upon them, may they and their families remain safe and their hearts be comforted as they endure the storm.\"\n\nWilliamson has caught attention for her apparently new age appeal, regularly referring to things like a \"dark psychic force\" surrounding Trump's presidency. Although Williamson was able to participate in the first two primary debates, she was unable to make the stage for the third debate in September.", "description": "Author Marianne Williamson, a longshot 2020 candidate, came out swinging Wednesday after a reporter tweeted a screenshot of her appearing to attribute Hurricane Dorian's changed path to the\u00a0\"creative use of the power of the mind.\"", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
