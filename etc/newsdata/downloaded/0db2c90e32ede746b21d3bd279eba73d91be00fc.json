It is 70% owned by the Lundbeck Foundation, one of Denmark\u2019s biggest industrial foundations.\n\nRoughly 39 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.\n\nAnnual global drug sales to treat migraines could total $8.7 billion by 2026, according to the GlobalData analytics firm.\n\nIf the transaction, valued at up to $1.95 billion, is closed on Nov. 1, the company expects transaction costs of about 200 million Danish crowns ($30 million) and integration and retention costs of 400-500 million crowns.\n\nIn the same scenario, Lundbeck said it would pay two months of Alder\u2019s operating costs, seen at around 325-400 million crowns.\n\nLundbeck expects to submit the eptinezumab antibody for regulatory approval in the European Union during 2020, and later in China and Japan.", "description": "Denmark's Lundbeck has agreed to buy Alder BioPharmaceuticals in a deal valued at almost $2 billion, hoping to reap profits from a potential blockbuster migraine drug.", "authors": ["Nikolaj Skydsgaard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
