The charges were upheld so far by two FIFA judicial bodies, the Court of Arbitration for Sport and Switzerland's supreme court.\n\nPlatini has challenged the Swiss federal ruling at the the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nHe says \"that means I don't pay this fine\" while contesting the human rights case in Strasbourg in his native France.\n\nThat ongoing sense of injustice, and unpaid debt, could cause FIFA's ethics committee to impede his return.\n\nPlatini suggests: \"They will try to use what they want so that I don't come back, I am sure.\"\n\nSoccer's world body declined to comment Monday on its rules enforcing payment of fines.\n\nFIFA did confirm that Blatter paid his fine of 50,000 Swiss francs ($50,250) first imposed in 2015.\n\nBlatter is serving a six-year FIFA ban, upheld by CAS, for authorizing an uncontracted $2-million payment to Platini in 2011. Blatter also extended his former protege's FIFA pension plan to add more than $1 million by 2015.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
