He had driven from Belvoir Castle, Lady Alice's family seat in Leicestershire.\n\nRoxy Music legend Bryan Ferry's son Otis (left) he's suffered further anguish after heartless thieves smashed the rear windscreen of his car and made off with an array of Lucy's vintage clothes which she had given his girlfriend, Lady Alice Manners (right)\n\n'Alice was due to fly to India this Sunday,' Otis tells me. 'There were two very large cases and a big handbag.'\n\nThe couple went out for a late supper, leaving the cases 'covered by the boot guard'. Soon afterwards the raiders struck.\n\n'Someone witnessed a couple of guys on mopeds smashing into the back of a car and informed the police.'\n\nBoth cases and the handbag \u2014 containing Alice's passport \u2014 were removed. But much more distressing than either the theft of the passport \u2014 or the damage to the car which Otis, 36, bought only last week \u2014 was the loss of clothes that Lucy collected 'over a lifetime'.\n\nHe says: 'A lot of the robes and summery outfits were my late mother's, which she'd given to Alice. Not expensive clothes, but clothes of great style: precious, vintage items. You can't replace those.'\n\nBoth cases and the handbag \u2014 containing Alice's passport \u2014 were removed\n\nTheir distress was compounded when they went to Notting Hill police station, only to discover that it had been closed last month.\n\n'And there's no CCTV anywhere,' says Otis, who became a pin-up of the hunting world after he stormed the Commons in protest over Tony Blair's plan to ban the sport.\n\nHe and Alice then led their own investigation.\n\n'We drove around the neighbourhood and found one of her bags in the middle of the road, so luckily she got some of her possessions back.'\n\nAlice, he adds, has now put up a \u00a3500 reward for the return of her other belongings \u2014 including her passport.\n\nRoxy Music legend Bryan Ferry's son Otis was left devastated when his mother, the former model Lucy Birley, was found dead last year at the age of 58\n\nGilbert & George plan to keep Boris in the saddle\n\nNo doubt, the usual Leftie luvvies will come out for Jeremy Corbyn during the General Election campaign.\n\nBut Boris Johnson can count on the support of celebrated art duo Gilbert & George.\n\nGilbert Prousch says Boris would sometimes shout: 'Gilbert! George!' as he rode past them on his bicycle in London.\n\nHe tells me: 'That's more than enough for us. We know whose side he's on. People are trying to bring him down with all this 'liar, liar' stuff. It's quite appalling.'\n\nThe pair are also fans of Cabinet minister Michael Gove: 'He's brilliant,' says Gilbert, who gives Corbyn short shrift.\n\n'Can you imagine if it was he who decided what art is? It would be all Nicaraguan posters.'\n\nBaby Helena makes City's Morrissey a granny again\n\nTipped to be the next Governor of the Bank of England, City 'superwoman' Dame Helena Morrissey has new cause for celebration.\n\nThe mother-of-nine's family expanded again when her daughter Florence gave birth on Tuesday to her first girl.\n\nFlo has named the infant Helena after her grandmother, who helped deliver the 8lb 9oz baby.\n\nThe mother-of-nine's family expanded again when her daughter Florence gave birth on Tuesday to her first girl\n\nSinger-songwriter Florence, 24, has a one-year-old son, Julian, with her Mercury prize-winning musician husband\n\n'Welcome to the world,' says Brexiteer Dame Helena, describing herself as 'so happy' to be part of the 'home birth team'.\n\nSinger-songwriter Florence, 24, has a one-year-old son, Julian, with her husband, the Mercury prize-winning musician Benjamin Clementine, 30.\n\nThey live in California and perform as the duo The Clementines.\n\nBenjamin Clementine, 30 and Florence live in California and perform as the duo The Clementines\n\nPeckham's most celebrated resident since Del Boy, Star Wars actor John Boyega, who plays the character Finn in the space movie franchise, has earned riches that would make the Only Fools And Horses wheeler-dealer exclaim 'Lovely Jubbly!'\n\nStill only 27, Boyega made a \u00a36.4 million profit last year for Upperroom Entertainment, the company through which he channels his earnings.\n\nAccording to newly filed accounts, the net worth of the company, which Boyega set up in 2016, is now \u00a38.5 million. Clearly, the Force is with him.\n\nHaving survived 26 years of marriage to hard-living Rolling Stone Ronnie, Jo Wood hasn't been put off matrimony.\n\nThe former Strictly Come Dancing contestant is going out with former rugby coach Carl Douglas and tells me: 'I'd never say never to getting married again, but we're happy as we are.'\n\nSpeaking at the launch party for her photographic book, Stoned, she says of Carl: 'He's just great. He makes me laugh \u2014 I like a man with a good sense of humour.'\n\nThe couple have been courting for a year and Jo adds: 'We haven't even had one argument.'\n\nLong may it last...\n\nNow that's a super selfie!

It has been practising Elgar's The Dream Of Gerontius for months and has three professional performances planned in the next five weeks.\n\nMany of its MP choristers may be unable to take part as they head for their constituencies to fight the election.
