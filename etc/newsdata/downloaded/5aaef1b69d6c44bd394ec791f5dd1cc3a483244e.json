So western governments are going to have to think much more systematically about how to respond. Otherwise they will find that cherished freedoms will be rapidly eroded.\n\nIt would be wrong to accuse Xi Jinping of hypocrisy when he argues for non-interference. AP\n\nIt would be wrong to accuse Mr Xi of hypocrisy when he argues for non-interference. The Chinese president is sincerely indifferent about whether a foreign country is a dictatorship or a democracy. Insisting that countries cannot have views on each other\u2019s internal political systems is a vital defence mechanism for the Chinese Communist party as it fends off outside pressure on human rights or the rule of law.\n\nBeijing argues that foreigners who express views on a sensitive topic, such as Hong Kong, are interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs. And this is where it crosses over into interference in free speech in the west. This is much more than an effort to stop foreigners standing in Tiananmen Square and shouting \u201cfreedom for Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s efforts to control and censor speech at home are gradually being internationalised, reaching into foreign corporations, the international media, the seminar rooms and campuses of western universities, and the statements and policies of foreign governments.\n\nTwenty years ago, it was fairly easy to brush off China\u2019s pressure tactics. But the massive size of the Chinese market means that western companies are now increasingly cautious about offending Beijing. The NBA swiftly sought to calm the dispute and the offending tweet was deleted.\n\nThat same week Apple withdrew an app that helped Hong Kong demonstrators evade the police. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market.\n\nThese are just the most recent examples. Other companies that have bowed to pressure from Beijing include Marriott hotels and United Airlines, both of which were accused of encouraging the idea that Taiwan is a separate country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultinational companies can argue that they need to stay out of politics. But that is a much harder stance to take for media organisations and universities, for whom free expression and debate are fundamental.\n\nWhen it comes to the media and academia, Beijing uses both visas and market access as a weapon. China specialists who are barred from the country can have their careers blighted. So the pressure to self-censor is huge.\n\nThe incentive not to offend the Chinese government extends to organisations as well as individuals. Many western media companies have (or had) ambitions for the Chinese market. (The Financial Times runs a Chinese-language website which is currently partially blocked in China).\n\nMany western universities have opened up campuses or joint ventures inside China. But the importance of Chinese students as a source of income means that even academics located in the US, Australia and Europe are coming under pressure.\n\nA politics lecturer at a British university told me recently that he had been asked by university authorities if he could remove a poster of the Tiananmen Square \u201ctank man\u201d from his office wall because it might be offensive to Chinese students. He refused. But the very fact that the request was made was telling.\n\nFor the moment, the reaction of western institutions to Chinese pressure is usually haphazard and improvised. But, since the problem is likely to become more intense, that should change. An attempt to draft some principles was made in a report for the Hoover Institution, which stresses the need for western organisations to be transparent about dealings with China, and to demand equal treatment for Chinese and western scholars.\n\nIt is time for Mr Xi\u2019s five \u201cnoes\u201d to be matched with some western \u201cnos\u201d \u2014 including a decisive \u201cno\u201d to restrictions on free speech. gideon.rachman@ft.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Twenty years ago, it was fairly easy to brush off China\u2019s pressure tactics.
