A leaflet sets out details of \u2018sanity walks\u2019 and yoga classes.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly the welcome you\u2019d expect at Britain\u2019s first mindfulness hotel, Inhabit, a converted five-storey townhouse in Paddington \u2014 the latest manifestation of the mental health mega-trend that encourages us to live in the moment.\n\nBut wait, central London? Who comes to the heart of the whirlwind for ultimate relaxation?\n\nIn fact, its location is very much part of its point \u2014 with a filtration system that blocks pollution, this, it\u2019s claimed, is an oasis of clean air and grown-up minimalism in the very place you need it most. A hideously expensive country retreat it is not.\n\nVictoria Woodhall (pictured in the hotel's \u2018meditation pod\u2019) gave her verdict on Britain\u2019s first mindfulness hotel, Inhabit based in Paddington\n\nThe interiors are designed to relax: wooden floors, cool blue upholstery and lots of pot plants. The luxuries here are time, headspace and health, not copper baths and chandeliers.\n\nIt\u2019s lovely, though it does rather take the childish fun out of staying in a fancy hotel \u2014 normally I\u2019d hoover up the mini bar and watch endless TV just because I can, but here I hold back and instead unpack my bag neatly.\n\nOn my pillow is a curated sleep kit, with proper silk eye mask, a \u2018sleep-inducing pillow spray\u2019 and relaxing magnesium oil to soothe my muscles and nervous system.\n\nI\u2019m an insomniac and this feels relaxing already, despite the low hum of traffic outside. In fact I feel cared for.\n\nThere\u2019s also an array of other relaxation nick-nacks \u2014 an Aromatherapy Associates diffuser, a scented candle by the Self Care Co and a kimono-style waffle bathrobe, which doubtless uses less water to wash than a full-length fluffy job. The hotel is all intensely \u2018conscious\u2019, with a strong environmental focus \u2014 every detail has a sustainability in mind.\n\nEven the loo roll is feel-good \u2014 ethically speaking \u2014 recycled, undyed and with 50 per cent of profits going to build toilets for those in need.\n\nAt the bedside I find a little wooden casket with a charger where I can put my phone to bed to help me resist that late-night scroll. I\u2019m probably not allowed wi-fi anyway. When I check the room information, it tells me there is connectivity \u2018if you must\u2019.\n\nThere\u2019s no minibar, either \u2014 sigh \u2014 but at least I won\u2019t be kept awake by the overpriced slab of chocolate I\u2019ve absent-mindedly troughed or the irritating buzz of the fridge. I can buy \u2018smart snacks\u2019 instead, such as gluten- free cookies, from the downstairs 24-hour \u2018pantry\u2019 (actually a set of shelves at reception).\n\nVictoria (pictured) discovered that the toiletries in her hotel room were all by eco-conscious brand Ren\n\nAt Inhabit, I am fast discovering, it\u2019s as much about what you don\u2019t need as what you do. Out are those luxury global traveller magazines that make you feel inadequate. In are inspiring art books and escapist reads; there are bookcases full of them in the cosy lounge area downstairs.\n\nThere are no disposable slippers or cotton buds wrapped in plastic \u2014 in fact, single-use plastics are banned.\n\nThere\u2019s an in-room water carafe that can be refilled from filtered water stations on every floor, and you can even borrow a reusable coffee cup for out and about. The toiletries, by eco-conscious brand Ren, are all refillables as opposed to nickables.\n\nNot that I\u2019m neglected; when I realise I\u2019ve forgotten my toothpaste, a helpful staff member \u2014 they are all trained in mindfulness \u2014 popped to the corner shop to get me some, mindful of my preferred brand.\n\nThe boldest move, however, becomes apparent at dinner, when I discover that the hotel restaurant proudly excludes meat, dairy and refined sugar in its dishes.\n\nFor an upmarket London hotel, this is radical. Instead I\u2019m delivered a vegan bowl of brown rice, pulses and vegetables, which sounds utterly joyless, but the chef manages to make delicious.\n\nEven the napkins are on-message, emblazoned with prompts reminding me to eat with my non-dominant hand (to make eating more conscious or mindful); to chew each bite 25 times and stop eating before I\u2019m full. There\u2019s also the promise of \u2018conscious cocktails\u2019 (alcoholic, with a healthy twist) and \u2018mindful mocktails\u2019.\n\nRooms with a Yeotown breakfast start at \u00a3126, Victoria (pictured) slept on a Casper mattress, made from organic wool and cotton\n\nNo, this is not a hotel aimed at cynics. \u2018It\u2019s for people who are perhaps already trying to be more mindful in their lives, whether that\u2019s eating a bit more healthily, trying mediation or buying more consciously,\u2019 says Mercedes Sieff, yoga teacher and founder of Yeotown health retreat in Devon, which runs the restaurant.\n\nShe\u2019s also running a \u2018mindful book club\u2019 at Inhabit, and a meditation course with a man called Light Watkins, who taught Meghan Markle to meditate.\n\n\u2018When you are travelling you find it hard to keep up those habits \u2014 to find the right food to eat or a place to do yoga. Travelling can be so unhealthy anyway and messes with your system.\u2019\n\nDo you then want the orange juice for breakfast that\u2019s full of sugar or would you rather have a turmeric shot?\u2019\n\nInhabit is the brainchild of hotelier Nadira Lalji, 32, who turned to mindfulness as a way of avoiding burnout. She wanted to create a hotel that wasn\u2019t a retreat, but was affordable (rooms with a Yeotown breakfast start at \u00a3126 \u2014 reasonable enough in the central London market) and had wellbeing as part of the fabric both for guests and staff.\n\nBuilding work starts in January on a much bigger Inhabit nearby, with more in the pipeline if the concept takes off.\n\nHaving mindfulness at the heart of a hotel certainly captures a certain zeitgeist. Luxury gym chain Equinox set the trend in New York with its sleep and performance-focused wellness hotel which opened earlier this year. And in London co-working space group Uncommon has designed its offices with \u2018meditation pods\u2019 (a comfy chair behind a wooden screen) as well as \u2018performance-enhancing scents and playlists\u2019. A wellbeing report commissioned by Uncommon showed that 92 per cent of UK office workers prefer \u2018wellness-enabled\u2019 buildings, apparently.\n\nYoga teacher Mercedes Sieff (pictured with Victoria) has created a number of sleep meditations that guests can play through their TV\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to turn in I retreat upstairs with a nice steaming mug of medicinal mushroom adaptogenic latte (adaptogens are compounds that help cope with stress) and a chocolate chip cookie that adheres to the principles of the paleo diet, all served on a tray marked \u2018gratitude\u2019.\n\nI hop in to the water-saving shower before snuggling under the duvet made from 120 recycled plastic bottles.\n\nThe Casper mattress, made from organic wool and cotton, is dubbed the \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 because it\u2019s just right for almost everyone; I sink in and tuck my phone up in its little wooden bed.\n\nAnd yet I still can\u2019t sleep. Which means it\u2019s time for one of Inhabit\u2019s short guided audio meditations, played through the TV. The sleep meditation is one of five traveller-themed scripts (there are also meditations for jet lag and home sickness) created by Mercedes.\n\nActually, I really do feel utterly refreshed in the morning and decide to check out the hotel\u2019s infra-red sauna and yoga studio.\n\nAlthough Mercedes doesn\u2019t teach there, many of the resident teachers are trained in her unique blend of yoga and positive psychology and she gives me a special example session.\n\n\u2018Positive psychology focuses on what\u2019s going strong, not what\u2019s going wrong,\u2019 she explains.\n\nApplied to yoga that means there\u2019s always something everyone can do without worrying whether you\u2019re \u2018good enough\u2019.\n\nVictoria (pictured) says she wobbled like a drunk, while taking part in a group 'sanity walk' led by psychologist Kelly Hearn in Hyde Park\n\nSo when I\u2019m in a tricky balance where I have one leg in the air while holding my other ankle, Mercedes doesn\u2019t tell me to \u2018do standing splits\u2019 (as if!) but instead encourages me to \u2018experiment with falling\u2019. We can all do that.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a mindfulness hotel without some kind of nature activity, of course \u2014 mindful practices often involve engaging with the natural world.\n\nI can borrow one of the hotel\u2019s Tokyo \u2018slow\u2019 bikes, old-fashioned sit-up-and-beg affairs that emphasise comfort over speed.\n\nOr I can take a group \u2018sanity walk\u2019 with psychologist Kelly Hearn in nearby Hyde Park. This, I have to experience.\n\nKelly, a Californian, says she uses walking both for herself and in therapy sessions with clients because it helps gain clarity on whatever is troubling you.\n\nA group of us gathers beneath a tree at the edge of the park (a five-minute walk away) and Kelly guides us through a standing body scan, where you focus on individual body parts to help connect with your physical self. Most of us are too stuck in our heads, she explains.\n\nWe\u2019ll be doing some very slow walking. \u2018You might be surprised at how slow,\u2019 she warns. And we\u2019ll be silent. \u2018There\u2019s great power in shared silence.\u2019\n\nShe leads us off at pall-bearers pace, inviting us to focus on the steps. I\u2019m astonished to discover how difficult this is. I\u2019m wobbling like a drunk \u2014 I simply don\u2019t have the muscle control. I\u2019m so used to powering everywhere in a tearing hurry that my body doesn\u2019t know how to slow down.\n\nVictoria (pictured) questions if Inhabit is for hardcore wellness fans only, however she admits that her stay converted her\n\nI\u2019m aware that as a group we must make a comical sight, like extras from Shaun Of The Dead, and people look at us as if we\u2019re insane. I notice just how hurried everyone around us is and how loudly they talk on their mobiles, oblivious to their surroundings.\n\nBack at the hotel, with a warming turmeric latte on one of the wooden tables creatively upcycled by the Goldfinger Factory, a local sustainable social enterprise, I do genuinely feel as though I have powered down and taken in what\u2019s around me.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t really buy the hotel\u2019s ethos, you can\u2019t fail to feel a little more uplifted and energised after a stay here.\n\nAs Mercedes says, \u2018It\u2019s about making health and wellbeing part of your day. We can all use five minutes to pop on some headphones and listen to a meditation or take a walk without our phones or be inspired by a quote on a napkin. It\u2019s just using those spare moments better.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s right \u2014 though I can\u2019t help but think, at heart, Inhabit is for hardcore wellness fans only. Most of us associate staying in a hotel with an over-indulgent meal and a minibar. Not everyone wants to be told off by their table linen, or stared at by strangers while walking like a zombie through the park.\n\nAnd yet there\u2019s a place for a hotel like Inhabit. After my stay, I\u2019m a convert. More power, I say, to their planet-saving passion.\n\nTo book a stay or yoga classes and workshops go to inhabithotels.com.", "description": "Victoria Woodhall gave her verdict on Inhabit.
