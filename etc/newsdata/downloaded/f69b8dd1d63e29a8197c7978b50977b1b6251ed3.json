Everything went according to plan.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 The whole time. I did everything I could to win with intelligence. I did not underestimate her in any moment at all. I knew she was tough, strong. I had to use my intelligence and experience.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pacheco, people were counting her out \u2013 and she knew it. She embraced the doubters and turned negative energy into motivation. The only opinions Pacheco said she cares about are the ones of those around her.\n\nThe victory sets up Pacheco for a rematch from the regular season, when she takes on Kayla Harrison on New Year\u2019s Eve in New York.\n\nThe Brazilian lightweight was unsuccessful against the American Olympian in May and lost the contest by unanimous decision. With harder training, Pacheco thinks she will get her revenge.\n\n\u201cI knew that nobody believed in me,\u201d Pacheco told MMA Junkie. \u201cBut I believed in me, my team believed, and I can to win. The rematch is going to be perfect. I\u2019m going to train double than what I trained last time.\n\n\u201cIf I was able to frustrate her in five days, what do you think is going to happen if I have months to train for her? \u2026 Train harder, get stronger, just keep hitting her until she quits.\u201d\n\nA lot has changed since her UFC days, according to Pacheco. When she entered the promotion she was only 19 years old. Six years later, Pacheco feels like a seasoned veteran and believes the best is yet to come.\n\n\u201cIn the UFC, I was only 19 years old \u2013 not a lot of experience,\u201d Pacheco said. \u201cI\u2019ve only lost to the women who have been champions. I fought against (Germaine) De Randamie. She\u2019s got that strength. She\u2019s strong. I knew when I fought her if she couldn\u2019t take me out, nobody was going to do it. Now they\u2019re going to need two of her to take me out.\u201d", "description": "With harder training, Larissa Pacheco believes she will avenge her loss to Kayla Harrison from the regular season.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/larissa-pacheco-pfl-2019-playoffs-1-post-fight.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
