A \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 question that didn\u2019t get a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer.\u201d\n\nMs Warren insisted that she has \u201cmade clear what my principles are here\u201d, arguing that lower premiums would mean that overall costs would go down for most Americans.\n\nCalifornia Senator Kamala Harris tried to get in on the action on another subject, scolding Ms Warren for not echoing her calls for Twitter to suspend Mr Trump\u2019s account.\n\nMs Warren responded: \u201cI don\u2019t just want to push Trump off of Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House.\u201d\n\nFeaturing a dozen candidates, the debate sponsored by CNN and The New York Times was the largest in modern history.\n\nElizabeth Warren speaks in the spin room following the debate (John Minchillo/AP)\n\nIt was the first time the White House hopefuls gathered in a little more than a month.\n\nIn that time, the political landscape has changed with Mr Trump facing an impeachment inquiry in the House centred on his quest to get Ukraine to dig up unflattering details about Mr Biden, another front-runner among the Democrats hoping to unseat the president.\n\nThe debate also served as Mr Sanders\u2019 return to the campaign trail following a heart attack earlier this month.\n\nThe Vermont senator failed to show all the fire of previous debates but made his points with force.\n\nHe was applauded when he thanked supporters and rivals for their good wishes and declared: \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d\n\nThere is no job I would undertake with more passion than bringing people together around an agenda that works for every person in this country, rather than just the 1% and corporate elite. #DemDebate \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 16, 2019\n\nThe debate touched on foreign policy, too, a subject that has dominated the news in recent weeks as Mr Trump said he was withdrawing most US forces from Syria and then Turkey invaded the northern part of the country to attack Kurdish fighters.\n\nHawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who served in Iraq with the Army, questioned the need for US involvement in \u201cregime change\u201d conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nThat prompted Mr Buttigieg, himself a veteran, to respond: \u201cWhat we are doing or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there,\u201d said Mr Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIt is undermining the honour of our soldiers. You take away the honour of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armour next.\u201d\n\nMr Biden has faced the sharpest criticism from rivals in previous debates.\n\nI just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out my bold vision for the country and how I\u2019ll deliver real progress for working families.\n\n\n\nIf you liked what you heard tonight, help us keep our momentum going by pitching in: https://t.co/s5nd6p8r7o \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 16, 2019\n\nBut fewer candidates engaged with him on Tuesday as they trained their focus on Ms Warren.\n\nStill, he struggled to fully explain why his newly promised ethics plan to prevent conflicts of interest involving his relatives was not applied to his son Hunter when he was hired in 2014 as a director for a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThat relationship has become a focal point of Mr Trump\u2019s push for a Ukrainian government probe of the Bidens \u2014 an effort that was a major factor leading to the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nTulsi Gabbard (John Minchillo/AP)\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Biden had vowed that \u201cno one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country\u201d.\n\nCNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked: \u201cIf it\u2019s not OK for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president?\u201d\n\nMr Biden faltered before offering: \u201cMy son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nTowards the end, Mr Biden was more confident when he accused Ms Warren and Mr Sanders of \u201cbeing vague\u201d on the true costs of Medicare For All.\n\nThe winner of the Democratic contest will duel with President Donald Trump (for the keys to the White House Evan Vucci/AP)\n\n\u201cTell people what it\u2019s going to cost, how you\u2019re going to do it and why you\u2019re going to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Sanders responded by criticising the former vice president\u2019s record, including his support for what Mr Sanders called the \u201cdisastrous war in Iraq\u201d.\n\nMs Warren also accuse Ms Biden of not doing enough as vice president to empower a consumer financial protection agency she helped set up in the wake of the national financial crisis.\n\n\u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d Mr Biden responded, waving his finger at Ms Warren.\n\nBernie Sanders debated despite a recent heart attack (John Minchillo/AP)\n\nMs Warren answered that she was \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d that then-president Barack Obama supported her efforts, implying that Mr Biden didn\u2019t help.\n\nShe swatted back at criticism of her sweeping plan to tax wealth Americans to pay for her domestic agenda.\n\nMs Klobuchar said she wanted to provide a \u201creality check\u201d on the issue while former Texas Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke suggested it was \u201cpunitive\u201d.\n\nMs Warren framed the measure as part of the ambitious agenda she is pitching to fundamentally reshape the economic and political system.\n\nTwelve candidates debated (John Minchillo/AP)\n\n\u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Ms Warren answered.\n\nThough Ms Warren fielded much of the criticism, other rivalries emerged.\n\nMr O\u2019Rourke and Mr Buttigieg argued about gun control, with the mayor saying the Texan himself was not even sure how the mandatory federal buyback of assault weapons he has called for would work.\n\nThat touched off a stretch where both candidates talked over one another.\n\nAt one point, Mr Buttigieg told Mr O\u2019Rourke: \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d\n\nAlso debating in Ohio were New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro and billionaire activist Tom Steyer.", "description": "Twelve of the Democrats seeking to be Donald Trump\u00b4s opponent in next year\u00b4s election took to the stage in Ohio.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/07/wire-19774718-1571207031-111_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
