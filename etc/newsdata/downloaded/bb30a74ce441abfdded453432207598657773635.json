Western areas will be cloudy, wet and windy\n\nMonday\n\nIt will be mostly cloudy with rain in the morning, some of which will be heavy in the west. South-eastern areas will be mostly dry and cloudy but the odd spot of rain is possible.\n\nThrough the afternoon rain will sweep eastwards across the country, allowing bright spells to develop in the west.\n\nTuesday\n\nBright with a mix of sunny spells and showers, which will be heaviest and most frequent in the west. Strong south-westerly winds.\n\nWednesday\n\nThere will be further sunny spells and showers, but there will be more cloud and heavy showers in the north and west.\n\nBrisk westerly winds.", "description": "Forecasters warn that the downpours will cause travel disruption across the UK with next week also unsettled", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Pa", "Anita Maric", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20490144.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Autumn-weather-Oct-1st-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
