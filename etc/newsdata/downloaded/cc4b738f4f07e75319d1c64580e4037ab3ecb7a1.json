This group wants to change that.\n\necortellessa | Washington Monthly\n\nWhen Meg Ansara arrived in Brooklyn to become Hillary Clinton\u2019s battleground state director in March 2016, her first task was clear: she had to go on a hiring spree. The campaign had virtually no staff prepared to do the work of registering voters and mobilizing turnout in the key states needed for a Democratic victory. In her first month on the job, there were just 300 battleground staffers in total. Over the next five months, she brought on almost 4,000. By then, it was already August 2016\u2014just three months from Election Day. As Ansara would painfully learn, that was hardly enough to time to train the thousands of staffers she spent months recruiting.\n\n\u201cSo much time was put into hiring that we didn\u2019t have the time or space we ultimately wanted or needed to develop the skills on the part of our staff,\u201d Ansara told me. \u201cEvery minute that you spend hiring is time that you don\u2019t spend running programs.\u201d\n\nThis has been aperennial problem for Democratic presidential campaigns\u2014the lack of a permanent voter turnout infrastructure in key swing states. Consequentially, in every election cycle, Democrats have to effectively start from scratch in each time to turn out the voters they need the most. As former president Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 get-out-the-vote director Rachel Haltom-Irwin said, these efforts become \u201cconstant start-ups.\u201d In 2016, that put the the party a particular disadvantage to Republicans, who created a permanent volunteer corps in 10 battleground states after Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 loss to Obama. Since then, the Democrats have been playing catch up.\n\nAnsara and Haltom-Irwin\u2019s shared experience led them to recognize a vacuum in the Democratic Party\u2019s advocacy ecosystem. There was no full-time, on-the-ground group committed to training organizers to boost turnout in the most crucial states to a Democratic victory until after the party had selected its nominee. Their answer was to create one.\n\nIn February 2019, they launched Organizing Corps 2020, with the Democratic National Committee and a political consulting firm and a political action committee, each founded by Obama alums. The idea was simple: to recruit college students, specifically juniors heading into their senior year, to start training during the summer of 2019, and prepare them to be formally hired as field organizers\u2014either for the DNC, the eventual nominee\u2019s campaign, or a state-based organization\u2014once they graduate next spring. That way, they can get started full-throttle right away in one of the seven key 2020 battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn other words, Organizing Corps 2020 is not only building an infrastructure for Democrats to increase turnout where it\u2019s most needed but are developing a \u201ccollege-to-career pipeline\u201d in which progressive students can hone the skills of voter registration, data analysis, and digital mobilization, and then put them to use in places where they are already locally oriented.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, this won\u2019t just help get Donald Trump out of the White House. It will create a model for Democrats to have a substantial presence in swing states for decades to come.\n\nLongtime progressive activists have long been frustrated with the Democratic Party\u2019s lack of investment in field organizing in swing states. Sandy Newman, who created Project Vote in the 1980s\u2014and who hired Barack Obama to run its Illinois voter registration drive in 1992\u2014said the status quo has made it impossible for Democrats to create an effective ground presence and turnout the young, low-income, and under-represented voters who can tip the scales in their favor in crucial states.\n\n\u201cIt is really hard to ramp up from virtually no staff to maybe 3,000 staff,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt says a lot about Tom Perez that the DNC realized the need to emphasize field work and was willing to make this advance investment that will help them be closer to where the incumbent campaign will be when the primaries end.\u201d\n\nDemocratic organizers already face an uphill challenge going into next year. The Trump campaign is off to an early start. The president filed for reelection on the same day he was inaugurated, and as of July, his campaign already had more than $56 million on hand.\n\nThe time constraints on the hiring process for Democrats have historically made it so they only hire staffers from social networks of people they already know. That means they\u2019re often bringing on unpaid\u2014or poorly paid\u2014young people whose parents can afford to subsidize them. As a consequence, they rarely employ staffers who resemble the populations they\u2019re trying to organize. That\u2019s why Organizing Corps 2020 is putting a special emphasis of bringing more people of color into the process. (Each student gets paid $4,000 for eight weeks of training.)\n\nOrganizing Corps 2020 looks to break out of the normal cycle. First, it\u2019s moved up the timeline for recruitment. The initial training of hundreds of organizers began this summer. Starting mobilization efforts before a nominee is selected is a borrowed tactic from the political action committee Swing Left before the 2018 midterms: the group raised money for Democratic candidates in districts it expected to be up for grabs before the primaries there had even been held.\n\nBut Organizing Corps does more than just throw money at a problem. The participants were taught some of the basics in interpersonal organizing at a one-week gathering in Atlanta before going out and using those skills on the ground. They were also trained in data literacy needed to target voters. In the process, they hoped to gain an edge in local knowledge in the states where they may later be stationed.\n\nBut critics of the program have noted one problem: there is no actual guarantee of employment on a mobilization campaign involved in signing up for the program. Instead, Organizing Corps 2020 trains the students to organize in one of the seven states, with the hopes of landing them in an formal organizing gig once they graduate. \u201cIt\u2019s an admirable thing to try to do,\u201d DNC member Yolanda Caraway told The Atlantic in July, but \u201cwhat are you going to do with [students in the program] after\u201d the training?\n\nHaltom-Irwin, the group\u2019s executive director, recognized that was a fair point. She said her team was currently in talks with individual campaigns and state Democratic committees to come to an arrangement about formalizing employment come next spring. She also said Organizing Corps 2020 is currently developing programming for students between now and next summer to keep them engaged with organizing during the interim.\n\nA senior at the University of Chicago, Gabrielle Bogert said she knew as soon as she saw the program advertised on Twitter that she wanted to do it. \u201cThe opportunity the program represented was something I know I couldn\u2019t find anywhere else: the chance to have a mentorship and a program that would help foster my career and my interests,\u201d she told me.\n\nStudents like Bogert, politically engaged and driven to make a difference, are the kind of candidates Organizing Corps 2020 has hoped to attract. It allows for a mutually beneficial tradeoff: the students get a resume boost and valuable training experience, while the party gains organizers who can help make a meaningful difference in the upcoming election.\n\nBefore this summer, Bogert had little political experience: she had phone-banked and knocked on doors in Florida\u2019s 27th district during the midterms. But when she travelled to Atlanta, she learned the real mechanics of organizing, such as how to effectively engage with constituents, convince people to volunteer, and use voter tracking databases. After the first week of training, she and her cohort travelled back to Florida, Bogert\u2019s home state, to do the actual work they had learned. \u201cThe chance to go back and get involved and foster more of a sense of political groundwork in Miami was really important to me,\u201d she said.\n\nBroadly speaking, the goal is to take more recruits like Bogert and jumpstart the range of organizing talent the Democrats have not fully tapped into. \u201cIn my opinion, there\u2019s no talent gap out there\u2014there\u2019s an access support infrastructure gap,\u201d Ansara said. \u201cUnlike most other professions, Democratic politics doesn\u2019t have a dedicated talent development program. That\u2019s crazy. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Organizing Corps 2020 has already shown some success at, well, organizing. This summer, its participants knocked on 50,000 doors and registered more 9,000 voters. The only hitch: it\u2019s unclear how the group will ensure its students stay with the program between the time they complete the training and when the real turnout efforts begin next summer.\n\nThere\u2019s cause to be optimistic, though.\n\nAfter last summer\u2019s training session, the participants returned to their campuses for the upcoming school year, with millions of other students who are intensely anxious about what their next move will be. Bogert, however, knows exactly what she\u2019s going to do once the school year ends.\n\nShe plans to be back in Florida, working as a field organizer.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jake Maher", "Nancy Letourneau", "Martin Longman", "D.R.
