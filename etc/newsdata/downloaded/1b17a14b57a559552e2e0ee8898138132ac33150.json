After all, didn\u2019t seem all that different from the hit to the head of Colts tight end Jack Doyle that got Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict kicked out of his team\u2019s 31-24 victory at Indianapolis.\n\nTrubisky, meanwhile, went out with an injured left shoulder after getting dragged down while scrambling in the first quarter of the Bears\u2019 16-6 win against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nHe joins Drew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger, Cam Newton, Nick Foles and Andrew Luck - who retired at age 29 after dealing with a series of injuries - as QBs who teams have needed to replace this season.\n\nHere are other top topics after the fourth Sunday of the NFL season:\n\nSNYDER\u2019S PROLONGED PROBLEMS\n\nThe Washington Redskins keep changing quarterbacks - this time, it was first-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins throwing three interceptions after he replaced Case Keenum, who had one pick Sunday and five turnovers in Week 3 - and head coaches - how much longer does Jay Gruden keep the job? - but it is reasonable to wonder whether they will ever have success as long as owner Dan Snyder and his right-hand man, Bruce Allen, stay around. Washington is the NFC\u2019s only 0-4 club. The latest stumble was a 24-3 setback against the division rival New York Giants and their rookie QB, Daniel Jones. It\u2019s probably irresponsible to allow a clearly not ready Haskins to play right now, a situation made worse by the lack of help on offense, from the holdout of left tackle Trent Williams to the lack of experienced receivers to an inability to run. Making matters worse for the Redskins is what comes next: They host Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, the league\u2019s most daunting defense and the rest of the 4-0 New England Patriots in Week 5.\n\nNO TDS FOR PAT; PLAY TO THE WHISTLE!\n\nIt\u2019s not often that reigning NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes is held without a touchdown pass. He threw for 50 last season, after all. But in a testament to Chiefs coach Andy Reid\u2019s ability to orchestrate an offense, Kansas City is now 3-0 during Mahomes\u2019 nascent career when their star QB fails to toss a TD, which happened in a 34-30 victory at Detroit. \u201cIn this league, it\u2019s not always going to be pretty,\u201d Mahomes said. His team was helped by cornerback Bashaud Breeland\u2019s 100-yard fumble return for a touchdown after Detroit\u2019s Kerryon Johnson lost the ball. The Lions eased up, violating the rule all kids are told in team sports every weekend across the land: Play to the whistle!\n\nDISASTROUS \u2018D\u2019 IN DENVER\n\nThings are not looking good for first-year Denver Broncos head coach Vic Fangio. What\u2019s going on? The Broncos are 0-4 and their defense is a disaster. Leonard Fournette, widely considered done last season, ran for 225 yards in Jacksonville\u2019s 26-24 win at Denver. Fournette hadn\u2019t run for 100 yards in a game since 2017, but three of the last four times an NFL running back topped 200 came against Denver.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NFL has a quarterback problem and it's only getting worse by the week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/patriots_bills_football_34529_c0-73-2906-1767_s1770x1032.jpg?232847d9c82050de5f71d7d0df45c8f58613236c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
