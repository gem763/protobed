(Arthur Mola/Arthur Mola/Invision/AP)\n\nThe first time I met Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, in 1996, I was covering the Sundance Film Festival for the Austin American-Statesman, my first job as a film critic. I was set to interview her directly after the premiere of her new indie film \u201cThe Whole Wide World.\u201d When she heard where I was from, she ran up the theater aisle and jumped into my arms, delivering a whoop and an ecstatic bear hug (or, more accurately, a Texas Longhorn hug).\n\nZellweger had just heard that she\u2019d been cast opposite Tom Cruise in a little romantic comedy titled \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d \u2014 a star-making moment straight out of the classic Hollywood small-town-girl-makes-good playbook. Back in Austin, Zellweger, who went to the University of Texas and grew up outside Houston in Katy, was a known quantity, her reputation already burnished by appearances in locally filmed indies (she had bit parts in \u201cReality Bites\u201d and Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d). Soon, along with Cruise\u2019s character, the rest of America would fall in love with one of the most beguiling, down-to-earth personae to hit the screen since Jean Arthur.\n\nThe day I met Zellweger, her future seemed thrown down before her like a veritable yellow brick road. It wound up leading her to two Oscar nominations (\u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary\u201d), one win (for her supporting performance in \u201cCold Mountain\u201d), and high-profile collaborations \u2014 some better than others, a few downright dismal \u2014 with everyone from Ron Howard to George Clooney and Ed Harris.\n\nSo it\u2019s somehow appropriate, nearly a quarter-century later, that Zellweger and I meet again, during another annual cinematic gathering \u2014 the Toronto International Film Festival \u2014 at what seems to be yet another pivot point in her career. In \u201cJudy,\u201d opening Friday, she portrays middle-aged Judy Garland in an electrifying star turn, fusing her own face, body and singing voice with the screen icon\u2019s to find an interpretive creation all her own. It\u2019s a startling, magnificent performance, full of belting bravado and softer shadings of nuance and pathos. And, with \u201cJudy\u2019s\u201d flashbacks to Garland\u2019s distress as a young actress being molded by the Hollywood studio system, it feels full circle in more ways than one.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know,\u201d Zellweger recalls of her giddy, can-you-believe-this? excitement at Sundance. Her hair pulled back in a messy-perfect ponytail, she still has that raspy Texas drawl, and she fiddles with a big gold statement ring that occasionally resides on her right index finger. \u201cI knew what I didn\u2019t want. I knew what I wasn\u2019t going to do. I knew that I wasn\u2019t interested in going down the road of the stereotypical young sexy girl. I knew that getting off that road, once you\u2019d traveled a certain distance, wasn\u2019t easy to do.\n\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to court attention,\u201d she continues. \u201cI hired a PR person to keep that away. \u2018Please say no, because I don\u2019t want to sit on the [talk-show] couch, I\u2019m not ready for what that brings.\u2019 So I pushed that away for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger as Judy Garland. (David Hindley/David Hindley/LD Entertainment/Roadside Attractions)\n\nListening to Zellweger describe her days as a newly minted star, it\u2019s bittersweet to reflect on her character in \u201cJudy,\u201d who as a young girl (played by Darci Shaw) is routinely manipulated by MGM chief Louis B. Mayer into sacrificing her health, well-being and instincts. It\u2019s a lack of agency, Zellweger notes, that was common not just within the dictatorial studio system but throughout society. \u201cIn any professional realm, you could pretty much assume that was the imbalance in the power dynamic with men and women.\u201d\n\nFor her, those sequences in \u201cJudy\u201d are of a young girl being robbed \u201cof the ability to acknowledge her own value.\u201d\n\nZellweger admits that she had her own run-ins with powers-that-be. \u201cThere were things about me that there would be meetings about,\u201d she recalls. \u201c \u2018What are we going to do about . . . ?\u2019 Because it didn\u2019t fit some paradigm or something.\u201d\n\nThe difference between her and Garland, she observes, is that the doubts of others never made her feel insecure.\n\n\u201cIt always came back to the work for me. I was more interested in not disappointing my collaborators. Because, where Judy was made to feel that she would be replaced if she didn\u2019t measure up to whatever it was they decided her image was going to be in order that they should market her in a successful way, I wanted [\u2018Jerry Maguire\u2019 director] Cameron Crowe to know that I was grateful for the opportunity.\u201d\n\nBut terminal gratitude is another quintessentially female disease, a form of self-abnegation that can be as reflexive, if not as toxic, as the demons Garland grapples with toward the end of her life in \u201cJudy.\u201d Zellweger says that \u201cthere were times when I recognized that what I was giving away \u2014 in terms of the things I would say yes to because I saw it as reciprocity or just showing gratitude for the opportunities and wanting to hold up my end of the deal professionally \u2014 I would recognize that the things I was giving away personally were of pretty great value to me. And that when you piled them up, the sum of those things is pretty costly.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s all hindsight, isn\u2019t it? You can\u2019t recognize it when you\u2019re in the mix of things, because you feel like this is the appropriate thing to do. \u2018I\u2019m paying my dues.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn 2010, Zellweger took a step back, turning down roles, going back to school, traveling to visit family, advocating for gender equality and breast cancer awareness, and helping her dear friend and publicist, Nanci Ryder, as she battled the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that took her life this year.\n\n\u201cIt was [about] having not taken inventory of life in a long time,\u201d she explains of the hiatus. \u201cAnd what I needed at that time as a person.\u201d\n\nAnd, she is quick to remind, it wasn\u2019t like she was on vacation. \u201cI just worked in a different capacity that was private, that didn\u2019t require going away from home so much and that enabled a little bit more consistency in my life.\u201d She prepared to star in \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Baby,\u201d which came out in 2016, and created a television series (never picked up) titled \u201cCinnamon Girl.\u201d\n\nStill, the inevitable pressure ensued, she says, adding that her advisers would tell her, \u201c \u2018Stop talking about taking time off! Stop saying that, because people will believe you.\u2019 And I was thinking, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not making it up!\u2019 \u201d\n\nDuring her break, when she emerged for a rare public event, her face seemed to have changed so drastically that social media went haywire with speculation about plastic surgery, an episode that led Zellweger to write an eloquent essay for HuffPost defending her right to privacy within \u201cour current culture of unsolicited transparency.\u201d\n\nWho knows for sure? Who cares? Let the record reflect that, today, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger looks exactly like one would expect a 50-year-old version of Ren\u00e9e Zellweger to look: still crinkly twinkly eyed, apple-cheeked, the bee-stung smile intact. Happy.\n\nAnd, let it reflect that Zellweger also looks vindicated. Her choice to favor self-care and meaningful relationships over conventional career advancement \u2014 a choice Judy Garland was never afforded \u2014 has gotten her here, to yet another role of a lifetime that marks a personal and professional watershed, not to mention the inevitable Oscar buzz that has swirled since \u201cJudy\u201d began making the festival rounds.\n\nIt\u2019s a funny business, a woman\u2019s career \u2014 the things you drop to get up the ladder fast, it turns out you didn\u2019t have to drop at all. Zellweger\u2019s advice to anyone looking for fame, fortune, health and well-being? \u201cIf you can, go adopt some dogs,\u201d she says simply. \u201cBecause you will be there to walk them.\u201d\n\nRead more by Ann Hornaday:\n\nA portrait of an infamous fixer \u2014 and his most famous pupil \u2014 in \u2018Where\u2019s My Roy Cohn?\u2019\n\nSilvio Berlusconi gets skewered \u2014 bloodlessly \u2014 in the silly, surreal satire \u2018Loro\u2019\n\n\u2018Ad Astra\u2019 is an astronaut adventure with soul, and its brightest star is Brad Pitt", "description": "From Next Big Thing and Bridget Jones to \u2018Where\u2019d she go?,\u2019 Ren\u00e9e Zellweger embarks on a triumphant second (or is that third?) act.", "authors": ["Ann Hornaday", "Movie Critic", "Ann Hornaday Is The Washington Post'S Chief Film Critic.
