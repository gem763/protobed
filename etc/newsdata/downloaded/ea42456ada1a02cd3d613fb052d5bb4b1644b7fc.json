The Republican National Committee is banking on it, because it's just released its first campaign ad exposing the Democrats' \"impeachment charade.\"\n\nThe ad notes that the Democrats are obsessed with impeachment, to the detriment of their constituents. The first example the RNC uses is New York Rep. Max Rose.\n\n\"Max Rose promised he'd tackle problems,\" the narrator says. \"Rose broke his promise.\"\n\nThe congressman had the chance to fix health care lower prescription drug prices, the ad continues, but he chose to \"vote with the radicals on endless investigations.\"\n\nAnd there are more where he came from, the RNC previewed in an email to supporters on Friday.\n\nThe RNC is spending over $2M highlighting House Democrats' broken promises in target districts.\n\nAds will begin airing this Sunday, September 29th in 25-50 House districts.\n\nOver $10M will be spent across TV and digital exposing the Democrats\u2019 impeachment charade\n\nThis is just the beginning of an all-out fight to defend our democracy & our president.\n\n\n\nDozens of House Dems campaigned on working with @realDonaldTrump, yet fell in line with Pelosi & the Squad.\n\n\n\nVoters don't support this impeachment charade & it\u2019s going to backfire come 2020! pic.twitter.com/fcb9Uvfvca \u2014 Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) September 27, 2019\n\nBefore we even laid eyes on either the phone transcript between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky or the whistleblower complaint about it, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared her party was launching a formal impeachment inquiry against the president. The released documents did show that Trump had asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, but there was no evidence of quid pro quo. The whistleblower also admitted in the complaint that he or she was not a \"direct witness\" to the call in question and the details provided were based on hearsay from White House officials.\n\n\"By the end of our campaign,\" the RNC predicts, \"every American will be ready to hold the deranged Democrats accountable.\"", "description": ".09/27/2019 21:02:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/270/547f8374-78b6-4189-abc1-67049a9ab500.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
