The situation prompted the largest peacetime repatriation of U.K. citizens in history, as the British government scrambled to charter planes to bring tourists back from around the world.\n\nAs a tour operator, Thomas Cook specialized in offering all-inclusive travel packages to popular destinations, especially in the Mediterranean. The company also operated an airline and owned more than 200 hotels.\n\nThe company blamed the ongoing Brexit negotiations and hot weather that made Britons less interested in traveling for its recent woes. But Thomas Cook also fell victim to the rise of online travel booking services such as Expedia EXPE, +0.17% , Booking.com BKNG, -0.93% and TripAdvisor TRIP, -0.93%, which have made it easier (and potentially cheaper) to plan travel online, travel experts said.\n\nRead more: When you should use travel booking sites like Expedia and Priceline \u2014 and when you shouldn\u2019t\n\nUsing a tour operator may seem unusual to Americans, but it is still a more popular choice among travelers from Europe. Around 40% of British travelers going on an international trip use a travel agency, compared with less than 20% of U.S. travelers doing the same, Kyle Valenta, executive editor of travel review site and TripAdvisor subsidiary Oyster.com.\n\n\u201cAmericans travel internationally to a far lesser degree than their European counterparts,\u201d Valenta said. \u201cSince Americans tend to drive or fly domestically more than U.K. citizens, the need for someone to provide all logistical support, like a travel agency, is diminished.\u201d\n\nIndeed, hundreds of thousands of people had trips planned with Thomas Cook in the months ahead \u2014 vacations that are now in jeopardy thanks to the company\u2019s liquidation. Here are some of the ripple effects the company\u2019s closure will have:\n\nPlane tickets could become more expensive \u2014 especially with low-cost carriers\n\nAs a low-cost carrier, Thomas Cook competed with the likes of EasyJet EJTTF, -15.75%, Ryanair RYAOF, +3.07% and other European airlines that offer rock bottom prices, such as a $25 fare from Dublin to Athens on Ryanair. The airline didn\u2019t just serve people who had booked all-inclusive packages \u2014 in fact, other tour operators often booked their clients on Thomas Cook flights.\n\nBut with this airline gone, there\u2019s one less cheap option for travelers. And that could give low-cost carriers the room to raise prices.\n\n\u201cMost European airlines have been complaining for years that there is too much capacity in the market,\u201d said Patrick Whyte, Europe editor for travel industry website Skift. \u201cWith less competition, prices don\u2019t have to be as low, so customers might find their flights cost more, especially on routes where Thomas Cook was the primary competition.\u201d\n\nWith less competition, prices don\u2019t have to be as low, so customers might find their flights cost more. \u2014Patrick Whyte, Europe editor for travel industry website Skift\n\nSome destinations may offer special deals to make up lost revenue\n\nThe Thomas Cook bankruptcy will hit some popular tourist destinations especially hard. \u201cCertain travel markets like Greek island Crete are concerned that the fallout of Thomas Cook will have a significant impact on their inbound tourism market,\u201d said Erika Richter, director of communications for the American Society of Travel Advisors. \u201cIt is possible that other destinations that rely heavily on inbound travel from the U.K. market may also suffer.\u201d\n\nThe Greek tourism sector is expected to endure economic losses of between 250 million euros and 500 million euros (roughly between $275 million and $550 million), according to a report from Greek newspaper Kathimerini, based on data from the country\u2019s tourism confederation. Similar concerns have also been raised in Spain.\n\nAlso see: These stocks could profit from the collapse of the package-holiday provider Thomas Cook\n\nSome hotels \u2014 especially around the Mediterranean \u2014 only booked Thomas Cook travelers. And in smaller towns, the entire area\u2019s economy could center on the influx of tourists Thomas Cook brought in.\n\nThese regions will need to recoup the business that has been lost because of the Thomas Cook meltdown \u2014 and as a result, savvy travelers could be able to find some competitive deals.\n\n\u201cLocal vendors who organize excursions in places like Greece or Spain, which used to see a lot of package holidays booked through Thomas Cook, might feel compelled to lower prices to make up the lost business,\u201d said Scott Mackenzie, founder of tourism website Travel Codex.\n\nThese deals won\u2019t necessarily last forever, though. Mackenzie estimated that these effects may last for no more than a year, particularly as other tour operators step in to scoop up Thomas Cook\u2019s former clients.\n\nNot all travel insurance policies will cover situations involving bankruptcies\n\nThe good news for many people traveling on vacations organized by Thomas Cook is that they\u2019re protected by the British government. The U.K. requires most tour operators to hold Air Travel Organisers\u2019 Licensing (ATOL). Operators who hold this license pay into a national fund when they book trips, and that money is set aside in the event that the operator goes out of business.\n\nThomas Cook held an ATOL license, which is what has enabled the British government to organize the repatriation effort and fly people back to the U.K. from the destinations they traveled to around the globe. The fund will also pay people back for money spent on upcoming trips through Thomas Cook.\n\nUnfortunately, not all Thomas Cook customers will qualify for this assistance, as it is reserved for people who booked all-inclusive packages. Those who simply purchased airfare from Thomas Cook will have to rely on other avenues for getting reimbursed.\n\n\u201cATOL Protected passengers with future bookings are entitled to a full refund for their cancelled holiday,\u201d the U.K.\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority said Monday. \u201cPassengers currently overseas may also make claims for the cost of replacing ATOL protected parts of their trip, or for out of pocket expenses as a result of delayed flights home.\u201d\n\nThe government plans to launch a service to manage refunds by Sept. 30.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This airline can book you a flight using an Instagram photo\n\nAmericans, meanwhile, have no such protections. Therefore, travelers should consider purchasing travel insurance (or using a credit card with thorough travel insurance protection) if they are worried about a company going bankrupt.\n\nInsurers may require that travel insurance policies be purchased 15 days or more before a travel provider went bankrupt to reimburse a traveler.\n\n\u201cMany travel insurance policies include coverage for \u2018financial default\u2019 of a travel provider,\u201d said Steven Benna, content director at travel insurance website Squaremouth.com.\n\nTravel providers can include airlines, cruise lines, hotel chains and, yes, tour operators. But there can be some catches. \u201cFinancial default coverage may not cover travelers if they booked directly through Thomas Cook,\u201d Benna said. \u201cThis is because some policies do not provide coverage if the company that solicits the travel insurance goes bankrupt.\u201d\n\nSome insurers may also require that the insurance policy in question be purchased 15 days or more before the firm in question went bankrupt, said Stan Sandberg, co-founder of TravelInsurance.com.\n\nFor those looking to book with American-based tour operators, another option is to go through a company that\u2019s a member of the National Tour Association, as members are required to carry insurance policies to protect their clients, according to Bob Rouse, the organization\u2019s vice president.", "description": "Airfare could go up, but some destinations could become cheaper.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR968_thomas_ZG_20190924154006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
