His mother ran a small restaurant out of their home, and his usual greeting to friends isn't \"hello\" but \"Have you eaten rice yet?\"\n\nAfter studying at Le Cordon Bleu in Bangkok, working at Chicago's acclaimed Alinea and running two successful Vietnamese restaurants in Hong Kong, Franklin could have rested on his laurels.\n\nInstead, he chose to return to his native country and introduce some of the different flavors he'd tried around the world into traditional Vietnamese cooking.\n\nRelated content 13 essential Vietnam experiences\n\nHe chose the name \"Anan\" -- which means, \"Eat, eat!\" -- for his restaurant.\n\nWhatever you say about Franklin's food, though, don't call it fusion. The chef believes that despite its Japanese provenance, sake fits in seamlessly with Vietnamese flavors.\n\nAnan Saigon's caviar pho features a savory sake broth. CNN\n\n\"Anything that grows together will be happy together,\" Franklin says about selecting complementary ingredients. For him, using sake with rice-based dishes makes perfect sense.\n\nHis caviar pho is prepared in a savory, indulgent sake broth.\n\nOther than the sake, the dish's ingredients -- jellyfish, sturgeon, dill, and of course pho noodles -- come from the Ch\u1ee3 C\u0169 T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1m wet market close to the restaurant.\n\nBut it's not enough to just detect the notes of sake in the pho itself. Franklin recommends pairing his dish with Yamahai Junmai, one of the world's most prestigious sakes.\n\nYamahai Junmai is manufactured by Tedorigawa, one of Japan's most iconic sake makers. The brand was spotlighted in the 2015 film \"The Making of Sake,\" a documentary that debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.\n\nDining solo, or enjoying a late night? Head upstairs to Nhau Nhau, a sexy pho and cocktail bar that Franklin dubs \"the sequel\" to Anan. Yes, there's plenty of sake on the menu.", "description": "At Peter Cuong Franklin's acclaimed restaurant Anan Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, pho is taken to a whole new level thanks to a secret ingredient -- Japanese sake.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190916092806-pho-anan-culinary-journeys-sake-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
