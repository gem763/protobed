This is despite Johnson later asking the bloc for a three-month extension following Saturday\u2019s parliamentary defeat of his exit plan.\n\nJohnson will attempt another vote in parliament on Monday. A so-called hard Brexit\u2014meaning leaving without a deal\u2014could have severe repercussions for global risk markets, including oil, which has been struggling over the past month to break clear of the $55 per barrel cap on and $60 on global benchmark .\n\nBrexit Limbo Could Cause Risk Assets Across The Board To Gap\n\nFiona Cincotta, analyst at forex.com, warned in a note that \u201crisk assets across the board may gap\u201d with another crushing defeat for Britain\u2019s divorce plan.\n\nThe other Archilees heel for oil has been disappointing economic data points emerging from China.\n\nin the world's second-largest economy slipped to 6% in the three months ending in September, down from the previous quarter's 6.2%, data showed on Friday. It was the weakest level since China started reporting data by quarters in 1993.\n\nAnemic Chinese Data Continues To Hurt Oil\n\nDominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute in New York, said:\n\n\u201cThe market is becoming exceedingly concerned over a China economic slowdown as global oil demand growth will likely follow downward, as China is the number one oil demand growth engine in the oil complex.\u201d\n\nWTI 300-Min Chart\n\nOil has been locked in a $5 range either way in the aftermath of the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nOn Sunday, Russia added to the already feeble risk appetite in oil by admitting it produced more crude in September than envisaged by its deal with OPEC, its price-support ally of the past three years.\n\nRussia\u2019s Games With OPEC+ Also Weighing On The Market\n\nRussia, OPEC and other oil producers, in an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from the start of this year. Moscow said at the weekend it breached its OPEC+ production quota last month after an increase in gas condensates output, as it prepared for winter.\n\nWhile several members of OPEC have spoken out in the past of Russia\u2019s selective practice in the enforcement of its OPEC commitment, the cartel\u2019s kingpin Saudi Arabia has refrained from openly criticising Russia on this due to the sensitivity of Moscow\u2019s role as a non-member ally.\n\nSome analysts argued that element further emboldened Russia in acting as it pleased with OPEC, to the dismay of others in the 14-member group.\n\nSaudi-Kuwait New Oil Venture Could Bring More Unwanted Barrels\n\nAdding to the weight on oil is an attempt by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to restart oil production from jointly-operated fields in the 500,000 bpd Neutral Zone.\n\nKuwaiti media, citing unidentified sources, said the two key OPEC members had agreed to revive crude output from oilfields in the Saudi\u2013Kuwaiti divided zone. Kuwait\u2019s deputy foreign minister has so far described negotiations on the project as \u201cvery positive\".\n\nAnalysts, however, weren\u2019t as excited about the prospects of the two Gulf giants adding more oil to a market struggling once again from the perception of oversupply.\n\nStephen Innes, market strategist at AxiTrader, was quoted saying by Reuters:\n\n\"Those extra barrels will come to market at a most unwelcome time.\u201d\n\nGold Could Stay Near $1,500 Level\n\nGold posted a weekly gain in Friday\u2019s market but safe-haven investors and those traditionally long the yellow metal largely sat out, letting prices dip, with few leads to chase ahead of the Brexit vote.\n\nThe commodity also dipped on signs fewer central banks around the world might ramp up on another round of monetary easing.\n\nGold 60-Min Chart\n\nFor the week, both and posted a slight gain, although they remained just under the key $1,500 bullish line.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Barani Krishnan/Investing.com covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
