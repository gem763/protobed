The toads first arrived in a site monitored by the researchers in WA in 2011.\n\nBut to their surprise, the scientists found the native water rat \u2013 better known as the rakali \u2013 was fighting back. The highly intelligent rodent has extremely sharp claws and teeth, and can grow to up 1kg in weight.\n\nDr Marissa Parrott, the paper\u2019s co-author, said the scientists began to see dead toads appear, cut open in a \u201cvery distinctive\u201d way.\n\n\u201cIt was a small area of creek, three to five metres in size, and every day we were finding new dead cane toads,\u201d she said. \u201cUp to five every single morning.\n\n\u201cThey were flipping them over, making a very distinctive, almost surgical precision cut down the chest. They would even remove the gallbladder outside the body, which contains toxic bile salts. They knew to remove that bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the medium-sized toads, as well as eating the heart and liver, they would strip off the toxic skin from one or both legs and eat the non-toxic thigh muscle.\n\nSnorkelling grandmothers uncover large population of venomous sea snakes in Noumea Read more\n\n\u201cThey have very strong sharp teeth, very dextrous little hands. They can puck up a fish or a yabby and open them up very quickly and target the areas they like.\u201d\n\nAccording to the paper, researchers observed 38 toad carcasses, floating in the river or on the creekbank, over 15 days.\n\n\u201cAll carcasses had an incision in the chest area, measuring [on average] 10.8mm vertically and 12.2mm horizontally,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThere was no evidence of bites to the head or body of the partially consumed toads. Rather, the rats appeared to hold the toad on its back and then incise the thoracic cavity to consume organs while the toad was still alive.\u201d\n\nParrott, a reproductive biologist at Zoos Victoria, said another astonishing finding was the size of the dead toads. While only 2.5% of the toads in the region were classified as large toads, the big toads made up 74% of the bodycount.\n\nThis suggested the rats were specifically targeting the biggest toads.\n\n\u201cWater rats are quite large themselves,\u201d Parrott said. \u201cThey have the power to subdue a larger toad and get a bigger payload, get that larger heart and larger liver. By killing those larger toads, it may be easier to avoid the toxic organs like the gallbladder.\u201d\n\nThis could have a positive effect for other native animals, because the largest toads are more toxic and more dangerous.\n\nParrott hopes other water rats around the country could develop the same technique, and help halt the march of the toad, but said other measures were needed.\n\n\u201cThe water rats could protect small areas and could slow the progression of toads,\u201d she said. \u201cThere have been anecdotal reports of water rats killing cane toads, across Queensland and the Northern Territory. But there are so many hundreds of millions of cane toads those areas could get swamped. It\u2019s a major issue for our native predators.\u201d\n\nThe researchers hypothesise that the rats either learned from scratch \u2013 by figuring out which parts of the toad made them sick \u2013 or already had previous experience from eating Australian native toxic frogs.\n\nEither way, Parrott said, it was likely helped by the fact the rats spent a lot of time raising their children.\n\n\u201cThe parents have quite a long period of care with their offspring. The baby rats will stay with their mother \u2013 and they can learn from their parents. It would make very good sense that their parents are teaching their children how to kill those cane toads and avoid those poisonous areas.\n\n\u201cAnd it is very possible that those children will spread to other areas and teach their children how to kill and eat those biggest toads.\u201d\n\nOther animals, like crows and kites, have been observed turning cane toads inside out to avoid the toxic skin and only eat non-poisonous organs, the report said.\n\nParrott said her focus was now on promoting water rat conservation. The rats face threats from pollution of waterways, can be caught in fishing line and discarded balloons, and hunted by stray cats, foxes and dogs.\n\n\u201c[The findings] show the intelligence of our native rodents,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t really know we have native rodents in Australia. A story like this has really raised their profile and made people not only realise they are very clever but they are a very beautiful animal we should be protecting.\u201d", "description": "Scientists say native rodents in Western Australia have discovered how to kill and eat parts of the poisonous pests", "authors": ["Naaman Zhou"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f71ec39dded82c096e4f640152fe7f578e0f2dbd/31_0_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b118f8e3d03e010f55ddf61dfe429abd", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
