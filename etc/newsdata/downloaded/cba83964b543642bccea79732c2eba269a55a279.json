(Ocearch)\n\nOcearch expedition leader Chris Fisher is on a boat off Nova Scotia tracking Brunswick and number of other sharks around the Maritimes.\n\n\"There's a big white shark puzzle up here in Atlantic Canada that I think people just thought there was the odd shark coming through the area randomly,\" said Fisher.\n\n\"But there's a whole system of white sharks up here now and we're really just starting to get our heads around the tip of the iceberg. If you live in Canada and you swim, you've been swimming with white sharks your entire life. It's something that is talked about only because of the movies.
