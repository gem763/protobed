Farmers are expected to reap 50%-60% more beans within the next five years, said Pranoto Soenarto, deputy chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters and Industries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling all the stakeholders, especially roasters, to work together to help the farmers\u201d with funding and increasing productivity, Soenarto said in an interview on the side lines of an industry seminar in Bandung.\n\nAn increase in supply from the Southeast Asian nation may pressure Robusta futures that have tumbled to the lowest since 2008, when trading began.
