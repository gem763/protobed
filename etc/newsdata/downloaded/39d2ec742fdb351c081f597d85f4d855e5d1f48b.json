in this case, the fishermen are protected,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the state government has to make difficult decisions in deciding trade-offs to gain benefits for the longer term.\n\n\u201cThe state government does not merely reclaim land for the sake of reclaiming,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it is part of a much larger goal of building a comprehensive transportation network and industrial infrastructure for Pulau Pinang.\n\n\u201cOf course, we are aware that these fishermen will be the group that will bear the brunt of this trade-off,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the state strictly sticks to its policy to ensure that the fishermen will be not left out from this development by ensuring sustainability of the fishing grounds and providing a better future for them by proposing an alternative income apart from fishing.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the fact that sometimes the right decisions are also unpopular ones,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the state will have to persevere and balance between the needs of everyone in the state, regardless of race, religion, be it for those on the island or mainland and especially fishermen.\n\n\u201cPolling sentiments do not determine our decision making, it is the wellbeing of all Penangites that guides our decisions, hope this clears the air,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PSR is the state\u2019s plans to reclaim three islands covering 4,500 acres off the southern coast of the island.\n\nIt was not increase the state\u2019s land bank while at the same time be the funding module for the state\u2019s ambitious RM46 billion Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP).\n\nRelated Articles In Penang, Anwar says not to ignore concerns raised about massive reclamation Penang exco says more discussions needed on proposed single-stream schools Make defibrillators compulsory in public spaces, Putrajaya told", "description": "GEORGE TOWN, Oct 24 \u2015 Less than 20 per cent of fishing boats in the state operate within the area earmarked for the Penang South Reclamation (PSR) project, state exco Dr Afif Bahardin said today....", "authors": ["Opalyn Mok"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x4eXRCNZggnYxU.Sc8CTHA--~B/aD02Njc7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/a4b6410838b39d166f9c9e3117145537", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
