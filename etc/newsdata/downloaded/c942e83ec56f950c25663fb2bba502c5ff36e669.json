Miss Begum is pictured keeping a beside vigil after the brain-damaged five-year-old started new treatment\n\nBut, in a legal victory that stunned the medical profession, a judge sided with the family \u2013 citing 'the sanctity of life' \u2013 and allowed them to transfer her to the Gaslini hospital in Genoa.\n\nItalian doctors told the family that Tafida could be back home in Newham, east London, 'in a year'.\n\nMiss Begum, a solicitor, told The Sun: 'I used to think doctors were second only to God. That belief was shattered when I was told by the NHS that saving my daughter was 'futile'.'\n\nEight months on life support in England have not damaged Tafida's lungs and heart, scans have shown, and Miss Begum hopes that Tafida will soon be out of bed.\n\nThe Learjet air ambulance - which almost didn't leave due to bad weather in Genoa -landed in Biggin Hill airfield, Kent, on Tuesday to transfer Tafida.

We will give her time to get better.\n\n'The objective is to transition her from intensive care to home care.\n\nTafida had a seven-hour operation after the blood vessel burst in her brain. She was given a one per cent chance of survival before falling into a coma.

That belief was shattered when I was told by the NHS that saving my daughter was 'futile'.' Pictured: Miss Begum during a press conference on Wednesday\n\n'We will teach the parents how to care for her at home. We have spoken to them very openly. Our assessment is exactly the same as the doctors in the UK, so we are not giving them false hope. But what we can give them is time.\n\n'After such a brain injury, nobody can say in just six months what is her potential for recovery. In the medical literature, you wait one year to see.'\n\nTafida's family are funding her stay with public and private donations. They have applied for her to become an Italian citizen, which would reduce their bills.\n\nDr Andrea Moscatelli, head of the neurological department, said Tafida would undergo a tracheostomy operation.

She was given a one per cent chance of survival before falling into a coma.\n\nShe was then given 24 hours to live but opened her eyes after two weeks.\n\nThe family have raised around \u00a335,000 of a \u00a3400,000 target to fund their costs.\n\n", "description": "Shelina Begum, 40, is at Gaslini hospital in Genoa with daughter, Tafida Raqeeb.
