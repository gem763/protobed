As such, the American public would do well to stay vigilant about what his administration is up to \u2014 and not be shy about applying pressure.\n\nIt has long been clear that Mr. Trump is not the decisive, resolute leader he imagines himself to be. His presidency is littered with plans and pronouncements that were walked back or abandoned \u2014 some good, some not so good. His announcement last December that he was pulling all American troops from Syria was dramatically revised after pushback from foreign allies, lawmakers and his military advisers. This June, he approved military strikes on Iran in retaliation for its downing of an American drone, then canceled them. Last month, facing market turmoil and concerns from retailers and business groups, Mr. Trump postponed imposing additional tariffs on some Chinese consumer goods until after the start of the Christmas shopping season. He also floated the idea of cutting payroll taxes to goose the economy, only to reverse himself a day later with a declaration that the economy was plenty \u201cstrong.\u201d Responding to back-to-back gun massacres, the president vowed to push for \u201csensible, important background checks\u201d \u2014 until the National Rifle Association voiced its displeasure. At that point, Mr. Trump\u2019s resolve wilted faster than you could say \u201c$30 million in campaign contributions.\u201d Not that he would admit to folding. He instead spent weeks offering rambling comments about possible legislation. The White House is expected to clarify his latest position soon.\n\nEven with issues central to Mr. Trump\u2019s brand, he will now and again give ground. Recall last summer\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents \u2014 a move so appalling that even some of the president\u2019s Republican apologists could not stomach it. After six weeks of international uproar, Mr. Trump announced an end to the practice.\n\nHe executed a similar flip-flop this winter, when Congress\u2019s refusal to give him billions in border wall funding led him to provoke a partial government shutdown. When the public grew grumpy enough about the disruption, the president caved and signed a bill that did not include his desired wall money.\n\nOn occasion, Mr. Trump will move to reverse his reversals \u2014 or at least find a creative work around. Last month, the administration unveiled a new rule that would do away with the existing 20-day limit on holding migrant children in detention. On Tuesday, it announced that it is diverting $3.6 billion from Defense Department projects toward the construction of the border wall. The future of the medical deferred-action program remains unsettled as well. An agency official told The Times, \u201cWhether a very limited version of deferred action will continue forward at U.S.C.I.S. is still under review.\u201d Clearly, the public needs to continue expressing its preferences.", "description": "In the face of protest or pushback, the president reverses himself.", "authors": ["Michelle Cottle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/opinion/05pushbackWeb/05pushbackWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
