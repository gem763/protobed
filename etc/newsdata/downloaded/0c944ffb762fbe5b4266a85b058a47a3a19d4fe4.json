The grief we will bear as a country begins with the families who have lost loved ones. We will meet them in this time of sorrow with open arms and walk by their sides every step of the way.\u201d\n\nThirty-five of the official deaths were in Abaco Islands and eight in Grand Bahama.\n\nMarvin Dames, the security minister, said authorities were striving to reach everyone, but the crews could not just bulldoze their way through fallen trees and other rubble because there might be bodies not yet recovered. \u201cWe have been through this before, but not at this level of devastation,\u201d Dames said.\n\nThe town turned to rubble by Hurricane Dorian \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nThe United Nations has estimated 70,000 people were in \u201cimmediate need of life-saving assistance\u201d such as food, water and shelter.\n\nHundreds of desperate storm victims gathered Friday at the port on Grand Abaco in hopes of getting off the devastated island amid signs of rising frustration over the pace of the disaster-relief effort. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos here,\u201d said Gee Rolle, a construction worker who waited with his wife for a boat that could take them to the capital, Nassau. \u201cThe government is trying their best, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing a good enough job to evacuate the people. It ain\u2019t livable for nobody. Only animals can live here.\u201d\n\n\u201890% of infrastructure damaged\u2019\n\nThe World Food Programme said it had delivered 14,700 ready-to-eat meals to Nassau on Friday that would be distributed to the islands. A senior WFP spokesperson said it had a team in Abaco: \u201cAssessments for Abaco found widespread destruction, with thousands of houses levelled, telecommunications towers down, and roads blocked; in Marsh Harbor, an estimated 90% of the infrastructure appears damaged.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cThe government building, the medical centre and the Anglican Church are housing thousands of displaced people \u2013 including women, young children and other vulnerable groups. Living conditions are rapidly deteriorating with limited or no water, electricity, and sanitation. With improved access (airport in Marsh Harbor newly re-opened), some supplies are arriving including some minimal food and water. The needs remain enormous.\n\n\u201cEvacuations are slowly taking place by ferry, as hundreds of residents reportedly flee daily.\u201d\n\nThe US was expanding its response to the disaster, with the Trump administration reportedly moving to requested airlift and logistical support from the US defense department, to back up efforts by the US Coast Guard.\n\nOn Saturday, the US coast guard said it has rescued 290 people in the Bahamas following Hurricane Dorian. It said that six MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters were carrying out search and rescue missions and providing logistical support, while nine coast guard cutter vessels were also helping in the area.\n\nDorian also hit parts of the Outer Banks Islands in North Carolina on Friday after briefly making landfall there.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kitchen staff on Royal Caribbean\u2019s Mariner of the Seas help put together 10,000 relief meals, in Port Canaveral, Florida.

In its latest advisory, issued before 2 pm ET, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the hurricane\u2019s maximum sustained winds had increased to 100 mph (155 kph) from 85 mph (140 kph), raising it one notch from a category 1 to a category 2 storm.\n\nForecasters say the center of Dorian is expected to move across central or eastern Nova Scotia late Saturday afternoon or early evening, pass near or over Prince Edward Island late on Saturday, and move to Newfoundland and Labrador on Sunday.\n\nHurricanes in Canada are rare in part because once the storms reach colder Canadian waters, they lose their main source of energy.", "description": "Rescuers battle to reach devastated communities as cruise ships arrive with supplies and volunteers", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4506d06cfb5a31e89c9514397746fd6f7623b2e0/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6341505bf94643520fc48c5253745758", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
