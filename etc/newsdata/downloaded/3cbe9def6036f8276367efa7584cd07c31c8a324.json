The president had a 25 July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he asked for a \u201cfavour\u201d and then urged Mr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy firm.\n\nThere has so far been no evidence of illegal wrongdoing by either of the Bidens. Mr Giuliani, meanwhile, is under increasing scrutiny among federal prosecutors over accusations of illegal lobbying in another country without registering as a foreign agent.\n\nExperts previously told The Independent in July that Mr Giuliani must register as a foreign agent for his overseas work. Mr Giuliani has denied the allegations.\n\nIt remains unclear what could happen next, though Mr Giuliani will almost certainly require legal representation if the House committees seek to enforce their subpoena against him.\n\nThe former New York City mayor, who ran a failed presidential campaign in 2008, told ABC News \u201cwe will see what happens\u201d if the House decides to enforce the subpoena.\n\nEPA More\n\nRead more\n\nRudy Giuliani needs to register as foreign agent, experts say", "description": "Rudy Giuliani has said he will not co-operate with an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump and insisted he did not need a lawyer following the arrest of two business associates accused of campaign finance violations.The president\u2019s personal attorney posted a letter on Twitter to the House permanent", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ipYy.oGWqFgJsGg1_eiazA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/598ba3001cd4d8c3b54de301abc84ee6", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
