Ordering food online - which has the potential to make the delivery person suffer heatstroke - or visiting a restaurant are not on my list of options.\n\nSo the best solution is to escape to a much cooler city where I can take a summer break with no worries about either the high temperature or what to eat in Shanghai.\n\nThis year, Qingdao, Shandong province, a city famous for its cool sea breeze - and more important, delicious and affordable seafood and drinks - is the destination my husband and I chose.\n\nWe embarked on a trip to the city for the weekend, leaving on Friday and returning on Monday, with two days of compensated leave.\n\nAs we drove north from Shanghai, we could feel the temperature dropping. When we approached Qingdao, it was only 32 C outside.\n\nLocal residents said it was very hot, and I could only smile.\n\nWe enjoyed clams, sea cucumbers, oysters, sea bass and cuttlefish on a long list of fresh seafood in Qingdao. We never worried about where to eat or the high prices, because everything was just right.\n\nPeople prefer to enjoy the food in air-conditioned Chinese restaurants in star-rated hotels with higher food quality. However, the price was just about a quarter of that in Shanghai.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201712/06/5a27a3f7a310786506f6fec2.jpeg", "published_at": "2017-07-25"}
