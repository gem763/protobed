One of them was a case involving Kim, who stepped down from the vice justice minister post after six days due to allegations that he had attended parties thrown by Yun, who hired women to have sex with high-profile figures in order to gain business favors.In two separate probes in 2013 and 2014, the prosecution had cleared Kim of all charges. The reinvestigation took place on Moon\u2019s order, and Kim was indicted in June for receiving sexual favors and bribes. Yun was indicted on fraud and rape charges.The prosecution concluded that Kim had frequented Yun\u2019s private villa in Wonju, Gangwon, as well as apartments in southern Seoul, where he allegedly received sexual favors from multiple women on 13 different occasions from July 2006 to December 2007.According to the Hankyoreh report, the reinvestigation team from the Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office included Yun\u2019s testimony that Yoon was also a guest at his sex parties in its report. The report was submitted to the prosecution through a special commission of the Justice Ministry, but the prosecution never probed the claim, the report said. At the time, Yoon was head of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office.Yoon, appointed by President Moon to head the prosecution in July, flatly denied the Hankyoreh report. \u201cI have not lived such a messy life to have visited a village of a contractor and befriended him,\u201d senior officials of the prosecution quoted Yoon as saying.According to one official, Yoon reportedly claims to have led a meticulous, blame-free life and stayed away from situations that could invite misunderstandings. \u201cI visited Wonju just once about 20 years ago. I have never been to Wonju other than that trip,\u201d Yoon was quoted as saying.The Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office formally issued a statement to refute the Hankyoreh report. \u201cIt is completely false. Prosecutor General Yoon has no acquaintance with Yun and never visited that villa.\u201dThe prosecution admitted rumors had existed but the Blue House looked into them and cleared Yoon. \u201cDuring the vetting process for the prosecutor general, the office of the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs had looked into conspiracies and slanders against Yoon and concluded they were all groundless,\u201d it said.At the time, controversial Justice Minister Cho Kuk was senior presidential secretary for civil affairs. Cho said Friday that he had nothing to say about the report.The Blue House reacted sensitively as the report could possibly involve the vetting process once done by Cho. Asked about the prosecution\u2019s statement that the senior civil affairs secretary\u2019s office, then headed by Cho, had scrutinized the rumors involving Yoon and concluded them groundless, a presidential aide said Friday, \u201cI don\u2019t know if there ever was a verification or what was verified if there was one.\u201dCho and the prosecution led by Yoon are currently at odds as Cho is pushing reform initiatives to weaken the prosecutors\u2019 powers, a campaign pledge by President Moon. At the same time, the prosecution is investigating alleged academic fraud and financial crimes of the Cho family, uncovered during the confirmation process of the justice minister.The prosecution expressed skepticism Friday about the conspicuous timing of the report.\u201cIt is extremely undesirable that a false, slanderous report was published during an important investigation,\u201d the Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office said. \u201cWe will take civil and criminal actions against this groundless report.\u201dA senior prosecutor who led the reinvestigation into the Kim scandal also told the JoongAng Ilbo Friday that there was no connection between Yoon and the scandal.\u201cYoon\u2019s name does not appear in the past investigation records,\u201d said Yeo Whan-sup, head of the Daegu District Prosecutors\u2019 Office who led the reinvestigation earlier this year.According to Yeo, Yoon\u2019s name appeared once in a report from a member of the fact-finding team, who had a tea-time meeting with Yun before the reinvestigation formally took place from April till June. \u201cSo I asked Yun about it during our reinvestigation.Yun did not recall mentioning Yoon at all during the meeting with the fact-finding team. He said he does not know Yoon at all.\u201dYeo said the fact-finding team\u2019s meeting with Yun was not a formal investigation. \u201cIt was not a statement that they had created while questioning Yun. It was a summary created after the meeting. There was no audio recording or transcript. There was no signature from Yun on the statement,\u201d Yeo said.\u201cYoon does not appear in any investigation records concerning the scandal,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cIt is lamentable that the journalist published the report without checking the facts with me. Yoon and Yun have no ties. That is the conclusion and we\u2019ve never attempted to cover up any claim.\u201dThe ruling and opposition parties reacted differently to the Hankyoreh report. Rep. Lee In-young, floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party, said he wants to check the claims made in the report.Rep. Na Kyung-won, floor leader of the opposition Liberty Korea Party, said the report is a new attack against Yoon.BY SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/11193817.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
