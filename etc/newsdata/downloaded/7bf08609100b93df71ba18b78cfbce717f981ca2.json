This is a mystery and a challenge to modern physics.\"\n\nThe other half of the prize was awarded jointly to Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz \"for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star\".\n\nMayor and Queloz announced the first discovery of a planet outside the solar system in October 1995, a success the academy said kicked off \"a revolution in astronomy\", with more than 4,000 exoplanets having since been found.\n\n\"This changed the way we think planets must have formed ... the way that structures form, the way that planets formed, and perhaps even the way that life itself develops,\" Christopher Conselice, professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe \"love of science\" should be the driving force for young researchers going into science, not the search for awards, said Canadian-born US researcher Peebles of Princeton University.\n\nPeebles was speaking over the phone on Tuesday to reporters at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, minutes after learning of his Nobel win.\n\nBoth Mayor and Queloz are from the University of Geneva. Queloz is also associated with the University of Cambridge, in Britain, where he is the professor of astrophysics at the Cavendish laboratory.\n\nThe Nobel committee said the work of the three scientists \"painted a picture of the universe far stranger and more wonderful than we ever could have imagined\".", "description": "Breakthroughs centred on 'ancient radiation' that originated during the Big Bang 14 billion years ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/d861aee9c42f4548b9ac6f01d80bfe65_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
