(Luis Antonio Rojas/The New York Times)\n\nTENOSIQUE, Mexico \u2014 The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation\u2019s southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.\n\nU.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September \u2014 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nMexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period \u2014 pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.\n\nIn interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous \u2014 and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.\n\n\u201cThese are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,\u201d Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. \u201cAnd each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.\u201d\n\nThe young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.\n\nMarvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced \u2014 and he pressed on.\n\n\u201cQuitting was not an option,\u201d Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. \u201cYou wipe your tears and carry on.\u201d\n\nFor the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they\u2019d kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.\n\nHis parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. \u201cWe can\u2019t bear losing another son,\u201d they told him. \u201cYou have to go.\u201d\n\nHe left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.\n\nAs for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.\n\nAlong the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.\n\nAs huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States\u2019 southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors \u2014 adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.\n\nThe Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later \u2014 this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.\n\nThe Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.", "description": "TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to", "authors": ["Paulina Villegas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wQjFP0F0BzVOTTVudLeVDA--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
