That court action is ongoing.\n\nThe Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, known as RLUIPA, protects religious institutions from unduly burdensome or discriminatory land-use regulations.\n\nLast year, the Justice Department launched a Place to Worship Initiative to focus on RLUIPA\u2019s provisions that protect the rights of houses of worship and other religious institutions to worship on their land.\n\nThe federal lawsuit stems from Troy officials denying an application by the Muslim group Adam Community Center to operate a mosque in one of the city\u2019s commercial districts.\n\nThe city\u2019s zoning laws allow a nonreligious place of assembly, such as a theater or banquet hall, to use the same building without further approval. But because of zoning restrictions on places of worship, the Muslim center had to overcome an additional hurdle and seek city approval to use the building, which was denied.\n\nJustice lawyers said the city\u2019s denial of approval for the center, and its unequal treatment of all places of worship in the city compared to nonreligious uses, violate a provision of RLUIPA.\n\nThe suit also alleges that the city\u2019s actions imposed a substantial burden on the Center\u2019s religious exercise in violation of another provision of RLUIPA.\n\nThe city did not immediately respond to the federal lawsuit.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
