(He\u2019s played by Ewan McGregor, who is notably not wearing a Black Mask in this first look.)\n\nJoining Quinn in the battle against him are Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), from the Gotham City Police Department; the Black Canary/Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), who gives just a hint of her superpowered voice while singing in a club (no telling yet how much that will play in the film); the crossbow-wielding Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead); and perhaps the DC Universe\u2019s most lethal set of hands, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco).\n\n[Harley Quinn teams with Batman in new movie \u2014 and makes his animated world a bit naughtier]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one they should be scared of. Not you. Not Mr. J. Because I\u2019m Harley Freaking Quinn,\u201d Robbie shouts to the Black Mask. It also looks like Quinn\u2019s famed pet hyena from \u201cBatman: The Animated Series\u201d will be a part of the fight as well.\n\n\u201cBirds of Prey,\u201d directed by Cathy Yan, arrives in theaters Feb. 7.\n\nRead more:\n\nMargot Robbie on becoming Harley Quinn and \u2018the most unpleasant thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2019", "description": "The Margot Robbie movie comes out Feb. 7.", "authors": ["David Betancourt", "Reporter Focusing On Comic Book Culture", "October At Pm", "David Betancourt Writes About All Aspects Of Comic Book Culture For The Washington Post'S Comic Riffs Blog."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4QAQjprIslJUHBxNlcj6nTzEHhY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YAHPR2JRBFDLXE5FKY3HK3BZAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
