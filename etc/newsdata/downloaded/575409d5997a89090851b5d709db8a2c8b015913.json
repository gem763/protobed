How Hwee Young/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nDuterte on the weekend told members of the Filipino community in Russia, where he was on a working visit, that he has a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disease that is causing one of his eyelids to droop, the latest ailment he has suffered.\n\n\u201cHe has localized ocular myasthenia. He had been worked up on this and it has not progressed, it remained localized,\u201d said a close Duterte aide, Senator Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go.\n\nThe president has had the condition for a long time, Go told Reuters, although Duterte\u2019s spokesman, Salvador Panelo, told a news conference he only became aware of Duterte\u2019s disorder after he mentioned it on Saturday.\n\n\u201cNothing serious,\u201d Go said, adding the president was \u201cconscious of his health\u201d.\n\nDuterte, 74, has retained much of the domestic support that swept him to power in a 2016 election, even though he has faced considerable international criticism, especially for a crackdown on drugs in which thousands of people have been killed.\n\nHe is known for a busy schedule and for giving long speeches, often several a day, and for working well into the night.\n\nDuterte has been open about his illnesses and once quipped that he might not be around until the end of his six-year term in 2022.\n\nSeveral disappearances from public view in the past have fueled speculation about his health but the government has repeatedly dismissed any suggestion of a problem.\n\nPanelo said he did not think that the president\u2019s latest illness was serious, adding it didn\u2019t get in the way of his \u201cpunishing schedule\u201d in Russia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m even amazed how he was able to survive this Russian trip,\u201d Panelo said in an interview with ANC news channel.\n\nThere is no cure for myasthenia gravis, which causes muscle weakness, but treatment can help relieve symptoms.\n\nDr Jose Paciano Reyes, a fellow at the Philippine Neurological Association, said if a person had ocular myasthenia for more than two years, the chances were that the weakness and fatigue would not spread to the other muscle groups.\n\nDuterte was the oldest person to be elected president in the Philippines since World War Two.\n\nThe Constitution provides for the public to be told of the state of health of a president, if serious.\n\nIf a sitting president dies, is permanently disabled or removed through impeachment, the vice-president serves the remainder of a six-year, single term.\n\nVice-President Leni Robredo, a leader of the opposition, was elected separately in 2016.\n\nDuterte\u2019s known ailments include back problems, migraines due to nerve damage after a motorcycle accident and Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which affects his throat. He also suffers from Buerger\u2019s disease, caused by heavy smoking in his younger days.\n\nDuterte is known for an unorthodox work schedule that typically starts in the mid-afternoon and can go on well beyond midnight.", "description": "Allies of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte played down concern about his health on Monday after the firebrand leader announced he is suffering from a chronic neuromuscular disorder.", "authors": ["Karen Lema", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437998688&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960GQ", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
