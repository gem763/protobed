Celebs like Jenna Jameson, Vanessa Hudgens, and Halle Berry all swear by it, and with tons of people pairing it with keto eating plans, it's likely you know someone who's doing it.\n\nIn case you're unfamiliar, intermittent fasting (IF) is a type of eating plan that calls for periods of eating and fasting (in which you can only consume water, coffee, and tea). During the time periods you can eat, you can generally eat what you like, which is why the plan works for a lot of people. It's simple, and you can tweak the schedule to fit your needs.\n\nThat being said, IF is definitely NOT for everyone. As WH previously reported, intermittent fasting can be a tough diet to follow if you're the type who likes to snack and feels like you're starving when you can't. It's also not a good idea for anyone with a history of disordered eating.\n\nStill, it can be worth trying for people who want to lose weight and are able to make the fasting work with their lifestyles. Luckily, there are tons of different fasting schedules you can follow, so you can experiment with which schedule is the best fit for you, says nutritionist Amanda Baker Lemein, RD, who is also a WH advisor.\n\nOf course, this begs the question: Is there one intermittent fasting schedule that's best for weight loss? Here are six popular IF approaches you'll come across online and on social media that people tend to follow for weight loss purposes\u2014and exactly what the current research says (if any exists!) about the potential benefits for each one.\n\n1. The 16:8 diet\n\nThe 16:8 method of intermittent fasting involves fasting every day for 16 hours and restricting your daily eating window to eight hours. For most people, this schedule means not eating anything after dinner and skipping breakfast. You might eat between, say, noon and 8 p.m.\n\n\n\nAs far as how the 16:8 method fares for weight loss? It could work, the (very limited) research shows. In a recent (albeit small) study published in the journal Nutrition and Healthy Aging , 23 obese men and women followed the 16:8 diet for 12 weeks. Compared to a group that had eaten normally and not within a set timeframe, those on the 16:8 diet took in 350 fewer calories per day, lost a modest amount of weight (about 3 percent of their body weight on average), and lowered their blood pressure. Still, it's important to note that this was a small study, and few others have examined the 16:8 diet specifically, so it\u2019s tough to say that following the 16:8 diet is a surefire way to shed excess weight.\n\nInterestingly, following this kind of eating plan may help with appetite control (counterintuitive, no?). A recent study in the journal Obesity showed that people who ate only during a six-hour window, compared to following a normal eating schedule, felt less hungry than the control group, even though both groups ate the same amount of calories.\n\n2. The 5:2 method\n\nTo follow the 5:2 diet, you eat normally five days a week and cut back to 20 percent of your normal daily calorie intake for the other two. Women are supposed to have about 500 calories on \"fasting\" days, while men have about 600.\n\nThis IF method resulted in more weight and fat loss compared to day-to-day calorie restriction in a 2017 study in the International Journal of Obesity . Again, research on humans is limited, so it's tough to draw major conclusions from one promising study.\n\n3. Alternate-day fasting\n\nAs the name implies, this diet involves fasting every other day. There are several different versions of this plan, with some of them allowing about 500 calories on the fasting days, and some encouraging that you eat even fewer or close to zero calories on fasting days.\n\nMany of the existing studies on the health benefits of intermittent fasting used some version of this particular diet, though much of the weight loss-focused research hasn't been conclusive.\n\n4. Eat-stop-eat diet\n\nThis method of intermittent fasting involves a full fast for 24 hours once or twice a week. For example, you may eat dinner at 6 p.m. and then fast until 6 p.m. the next day, and you would do this one or two times per week\u2014but not in a row.\n\nThere's no research currently on this specific method of IF, but because of calorie reduction, it's likely to result in weight loss if it's a fasting schedule that works for you. (Of course, keep in mind that not eating for a full 24 hours can be pretty tough.)", "description": "Everything the research says about the most popular IF plans.", "authors": ["Kristin Canning"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aPWHe8TCClCgxlaE4BvXsQ--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/7088125d0b589e69a3631a530b7e969c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
