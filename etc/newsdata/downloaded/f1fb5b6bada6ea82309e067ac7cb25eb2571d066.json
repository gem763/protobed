The Cut published an article Thursday suggesting fashion-forward readers should wear their cardigans backwards\n\nFunny: The fashion writer suggested the trend as a way to update it to be more flattering, but commenters weren't all convinced\n\nMad: Some expressed how they would not follow the trend, while others said the tip was already worn in previous decades\n\nJoking around: The article was shared on Instagram where it received some interesting comments\n\n'No piece of clothing consistently promises so much yet delivers so little. At link in bio is the cardigan trend happening right now,' the publication wrote.\n\nWriter Sarah Spellings delivered the hot take that people should alter how they wear the cardigan as it comes back into style.\n\nShe believed the clothing item, which features buttons going from the bottom of the article to the top, would make a more fashionable statement if worn backwards instead of the buttons on the front.\n\n'I bought a cardigan from Everlane, but I had a plan, courtesy of an image I saw on Pinterest: I would wear it backward,' the writer explained.\n\nHer reasoning to offer a twist on the style was because she felt wearing the cardigan as is offers a lackluster and 'schlubby' look to her overall outfit.\n\nBut putting the cardigan on backwards would instead, potentially, allow her to wear the trend in a more flattering light.\n\n'It has worked with several cardigans, including the Everlane crop and a long but still slim-fitting one in bright pink. It always feels like a special little treat, and I get compliments almost every time,' she wrote.\n\nCommenters were not convinced by they style suggestion and decided to express their concerns about it on The Cut's Instagram page.\n\nStylish: Blake Lively actually previously wore the style back in 2008\n\nFashionista: January Jones was another celebrity to previously rock a backwards cardigan\n\nCritiques: Not everyone was impressed by the recommendation to wear the cardigan backwards\n\nFashion history: Other commenters pointed out how the backwards cardigan trend has come back multiple times in previous decades\n\n'I'm very upset about this,' one person wrote about the suggestion.\n\nAnother commenter used this as an opportunity to crack a joke, writing: 'Next time something is on backwards or inside out, it's just fashion!'\n\n'Why would you do this for us rompers are complicated enough,' an Instagram user wrote, mentioning the popular one-piece item.\n\nSuggesting one should wear a cardigan backwards as a new style isn't relatively new to fashion, as celebrities including Blake Lively and January Jones have previously modeled the trend when out and about.\n\nAnd like other current fashion trends overtaking the industry, wearing the cardigan backwards actually started in previous decades.\n\nOne commenter stated the trend first came to be in the 1950s.\n\n'Actually [the] trend from the 1950s that came back in the 1980s. Come on @thecut know your fashion history,' the person wrote.\n\nIf this is the case, then the cardigan is potentially making another resurgence into people's wardrobes, further proving anything can come back into style.\n\n'Wow the 80's are back...just no acid wash please,' a fashionable commenter wrote upon hearing the news of the potential revamped style trend.\n\nNow it is just up to the individual on if they choose to pull their own cardigan out of the closet and put it on backwards.", "description": "The Cut published an article Thursday suggesting fashion-forward readers should wear their cardigans backwards.", "authors": ["Danielle Zoellner For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19311534-0-image-a-9_1570215818772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
