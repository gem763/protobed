The air is thick with anticipation before her arrival. When her car does appear - as prompt as Mary Poppins - the crew, the producers and even the catering staff all abandon their lunches and stand to attention. When she steps out, some even start to softly clap, as though she is royalty or perhaps even something bigger than that.\n\nBut Andrews, seemingly knowing the effect she has on people, brings it back down to earth.\n\n\u201cHi gang!\u201d she says cheerily, with that voice that for many is as familiar as their own mother\u2019s, putting everyone (almost) at ease as she glides through the room.\n\nEven TCM host Ben Mankiewicz, who is no stranger to speaking to screen legends, is a little awe struck.\n\n\u201cGod, every time you talk I think, \u2018She sounds just like Julie Andrews!\u2019\u201d Mankiewicz says to his guest.\n\nAndrews just laughs. \u201cShut up, shut up,\u201d she says.\n\nFor the next few hours, The Associated Press got a front-row seat as Andrews and Mankiewicz turned the little soundstage into a cozy living room for movie lovers as they discussed three films from her career: 1967\u2019s \u201cThoroughly Modern Millie,\u201d 1982\u2019s \u201cVictor/Victoria\u201d and 1986\u2019s \u201cThat\u2019s Life!,\u201d all of which she touches on in her memoir.\n\nAlthough they may not be as well-known as \u201cMary Poppins\u201d or \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d each provides a revealing glimpse into her work at different stages of her career outside of those beloved nanny roles. In talking about George Roy Hill\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThoroughly Modern Millie,\u201d Andrews reflected on her friendship with co-star Mary Tyler Moore.\n\n\u201cShe called me Millie and I called her Miss Dorothy for the rest of our lives,\u201d Andrews, who just turned 84 this month, said. \u201cI miss her so much.\u201d\n\nAll of the films are special to Andrews in some way, but naturally the ones she made with Blake Edwards, her husband of 41 years, are particularly so.\n\n\u201cWe made seven pictures together,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe first one \u2018Darling Lili\u2019 was such a huge flop it\u2019s amazing we stayed together for 41 years!\u201d\n\nOn \u201cVictor/Victoria,\u201d she said Edwards advised her to watch her old friend James Garner for inspiration, telling her \u201cnot only is he a great actor, but he\u2019s a great reactor.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlake would love to be sitting right here,\u201d she said wistfully as Mankiewicz praised the film. \u201cHe probably is.\u201d\n\nThe third film they discuss, \u201cThat\u2019s Life!\u201d may be the least known of the bunch, but is one that is in some ways the most personal. The dramatic comedy starring Jack Lemmon as man dreading his impending 60th birthday party and Andrews as his wife was a low-budget, non-union family affair that was filmed in her and Edwards\u2019 own home using all of their friends and nothing but a 13-page outline to guide the process.\n\n\u201c(Blake) wrote his demons in this film,\u201d Andrews says. \u201cIt was really a gift to us all to say \u2018I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve offended\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019s his apology to us but it\u2019s on film.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cHome Work,\u201d Andrews writes frankly about her relationship with Edwards, a man she remains deeply and wholly in love with and in reverence of but who also had his struggles with prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cI wanted to honor him properly. I wanted it to be truthful, but didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody, especially my kids,\u201d Andrews told the AP later that day.\n\nDeciding what to leave in and what to take out, she said \u201cwas hard and I\u2019m very nervous about that.\u201d\n\nThe films and her conversation with Mankiewicz will air on TCM on Oct. 29 beginning at 8pm Eastern and serve as a companion to the memoir, co-written with her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton, which picks up where her first memoir \u201cHome: A Memoir of My Early Years,\u201d left off: Her arrival in Los Angeles to film \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d with then-husband Tony Walton and baby Emma in tow.\n\nAided by the diaries she kept throughout her life, some excerpts of which are included in \u201cHome Work,\u201d Andrews gives a thoughtful account of her personal and professional highs, lows and everything in between. She tells amusing anecdotes about Alfred Hitchcock teaching her about lenses on \u201cTom Curtain,\u201d her fear of driving on freeways during \u201cMary Poppins\u201d and how Edwards stood up for her when people at a party were trying to pressure her into doing drugs.\n\nAnd she does not shy away from personal stories either: About financial worries, the breakup of her first marriage, deciding to adopt two daughters from an orphanage in Vietnam and her complex relationship with her parents.\n\nThe book and the TCM evening concludes with \u201cThat\u2019s Life!,\u201d although of course her Hollywood years continued after 1986.\n\nBut, she said, \u201cThey only wanted x number of pages and I was cutting like crazy anyway.\u201d\n\nStill, it leaves open the possibility of another installment.\n\n\u201cThere is so much more if I do write about it, \u2018Victor/Victoria\u2019 on Broadway and \u2018Princess Diaries\u2019 and other things and getting into the book writing,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThere might be (another). But not just yet, I only finished it 10 days ago!\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Everyone is on their best behavior when Julie Andrews is around.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Lindsey Bahr"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/film-julie_andrews_14705_c0-343-3338-2290_s1200x700.jpg?da92dbf189e87e59b707259e79e5040a257c8c4d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
