I just got told that I should read what Stanton et al found about pain.\n\n\n\nI. Am. Stanton. \u2014 A/Prof Tasha Stanton (@Tash_Stanton) October 19, 2019\n\n\"It was just ... this amazing somewhat delicious moment because you just never get that opportunity to actually be like, 'Hold up there for a second friend. I am Stanton. I\u2019m the one that you just mentioned,'\" she told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nIn a now-viral Twitter thread, Stanton detailed how she reacted during the \"cringeworthy\" and \"hilarious\" moment: \"[I said], 'I am Stanton,' held some serious eye contact, and then gave a big smile.\"\n\nThe man's response, she said, was \"visibly shocked, awkward silence, some attempted back-pedaling and then we both had a laugh. I told him that it was a massive compliment that he recommended my paper, that I am glad he enjoyed it and found it useful ... but that in the future he might want to be careful not to assume that other people don\u2019t know things ... especially when you are at a conference. We all make mistakes -- I know I certainly have -- but hopefully the message got across.\"\n\nSAchiefsci/Twitter\n\nWhile she said she didn't sense any ill intent from the person, she said it's still important to call out the biases.\n\n\"It\u2019s really important to be able to stand up and call it as it is because that\u2019s not a great way to interact with someone at a conference,\" she said, noting that this happens far too often to women. \"People will never learn if you don\u2019t call it out.\"\n\nStanton's tweet was retweeted over 16,000 times, prompting thousands of replies, many of which came from women in academia detailing mansplaining.\n\nMansplaining, when something is explained to a woman, often by a man, in a condescending way, assuming she has no knowledge of that particular topic, has become part of our modern day social language. The aggression is notably referenced in Rebecca Solnit\u2019s popular book, \"Men Explain Things to Me.\"\n\nI have had more than one male colleague sincerely ask whether a certain behavior is mansplaining. Since apparently this is hard to figure out, I made one of them a chart. pic.twitter.com/7DZ1RTrB3R \u2014 Kim Goodwin (@kimgoodwin) July 19, 2018\n\nOne of the responses to Stanton came from professor Dr. Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve, an associate professor at Brown University and author of \"Crook County\", who had a similar experience when she was recommended her own book.\n\nThis happened to me.\n\n\n\nWM prof: are you an undergrad or grad student?\n\n\n\nMe: professor.\n\n\n\nHim: what\u2019s your specialty?\n\n\n\nMe: courts, law & sociology.\n\n\n\nHim: You should really read the book \"CrookCounty.\"\n\n\n\nMe: i know. I wrote it. \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\udd28\n\n\n\n*gives Clair Huxtable stare* https://t.co/5gJVCkbiJa \u2014 Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve (@nvancleve) October 20, 2019\n\nVan Cleve noted, \"As much as we laugh about these aggressions, I think it's really important that we see that they matter. These aggressions are backed with power. Considerable power. The power to promote. The power to get fired. The power to have your reputation tarnished.\"\n\nMicro-aggressions, like mansplaining, can be internalized, she said. As a result, she believes women are tired from trying to \"outperform\" to counter the narrative being thrown at them.\n\nInstead, she recommends that women, especially women of color, do not internalize those aggressions and continue to achieve and press forward.\n\nFostering a sisterhood\n\nChanneling Van Cleve, Dr. Koritha Mitchell, an associate professor of English at Ohio State University, said she has developed a practice on how to not internalize the aggressions thrown her way.\n\nIn an essay entitled \"Identifying White Mediocrity and Know-Your-Place Aggression: A Form of Self-Care,\" Mitchell identifies \"know-your-place aggression\" and classifies it as a product of \"white mediocrity.\" She argues that seeing these experiences of racism and sexism through that lens can help anyone -- especially women of color -- gain clarity and empower marginalized communities to not internalize the opinions of others.\n\nMitchell hopes her essay can help other women in academia, and beyond, do the same.\n\nPaul Kotheimer\n\n\"We might make some progress if we can get white people, if we can get straight people, if we can get normatively able people, to think about what are your unearned advantages and how can you make this country less hostile for more people,\" Mitchell said.\n\nShe says it's important for people in dominant-identity categories to hold themselves and each other to higher standards to challenge the environment they\u2019re in and therefore create room for more people.\n\nTo move forward from these interactions, these female academics talk at length about being willing to stand up to men and women who try to bring others down and create a supportive space for their colleagues.\n\n\"We have to support each other. We have to continue to brag about each other\u2019s accomplishments,\" Van Cleve said. \"Elevate other women for what they\u2019re doing, because you know playing quiet about our achievements doesn\u2019t save us from the overall bias.\"\n\nStanton said, \"It\u2019s not about trying to be the smartest or showing anyone up. It\u2019s literally about connection and the best way you\u2019re going to connect with someone is by actually asking questions about them. ... that can result in an amazing collaboration that you might never have thought!\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t be that guy.\"", "description": "Dr. Tasha Stanton tweeted about an experience in which someone recommended a paper she should read.
