We have to forget that because we live in the future, we live for now and we have to perform and this team is a different team, it\u2019s a little bit different also in the tactics but that\u2019s normal because you lose players and the players you get in are different types.\n\n\u2018Every player has his own identity, we are playing a little differently but I think we\u2019re still a strong team and I believe it\u2019s a strong team, I believe it can develop and be again very successful.\u2019\n\nNevertheless, Ten Hag rejected the idea his side are favourites for Wednesday\u2019s match and sees similarities between his side and Lampard\u2019s young team.\n\n\u2018When I see them and their football philosophy. They want to play football, want to play in the opponents\u2019 half and they want to press high and stay in the opponents\u2019 half which is pretty similar to Ajax.\u2019", "description": "DANIEL MATTHEWS IN AMSTERDAM: Ajax manager Erik ten Hag has allayed fears over the Johan Cruyff Arena pitch after it was taken over for a music festival days before Chelsea arrive.", "authors": ["Daniel Matthews For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20042030-0-image-a-73_1571757657306.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
