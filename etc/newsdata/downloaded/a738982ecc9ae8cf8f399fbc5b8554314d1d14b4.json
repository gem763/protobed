I'm happy to go to jail,\" she said, referring to the 22-month prison term imposed on Audrey Tay May Li, 45, for drug charges in October last year.\n\nChan's request to defer her sentence to settle business matters was rejected. The court noted that she has been granted many adjournments in a case that has been outstanding for more than a year.\n\nDr Tay and Chan, who have three children, ended their 41-year marriage in 2010.\n\nHe sued her in 2014 for sending out 1,265 e-mails which he said harassed him or were defamatory.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled in February 2016, and Chan was ordered to stop harassing and defaming Dr Tay. But she persisted in flouting the order.\n\nIn February 2017, Dr Tay took out contempt proceedings against her.\n\nIt was the third time he had taken such legal action. He dropped the case the first time after she apologised, and she was fined $30,000 the second time.\n\nIn August 2017, the High Court sentenced Chan to two weeks' jail for contempt.\n\nBut the judge gave her a last chance by suspending the sentence for a year, on condition that she stop flouting the order and attend monthly psychiatric sessions.\n\nChan breached the first condition almost immediately by making comments on Facebook. She also failed to furnish proof of several sessions.\n\nHer non-compliance resulted in the High Court lifting the suspension in April last year.\n\nChan then appealed, but the apex court upheld the High Court's decision.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - PROMINENT businesswoman Jannie Chan Siew Lee started serving a two-week jail term for contempt of court on Monday (Sept 9) after losing her appeal against an order for the sentence, imposed in 2017, to take effect. .
