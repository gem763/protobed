News that the pair spent a recent Sunday together and everything was A-OKAY. \"They got along well and were so happy being a family with Stormi,\" the source said. \"It looked like nothing has changed with them. They are recovering from [their break] and are happy to spend time together again.\"\n\nAny official news about their relationship status will have to come from Kylie and Travis, not an anonymous source, Travis did share a sweet video of Stormi jamming to his song \"Stargazing\" on Instagram Stories. The video has since expired, but a Kylie fan account has a recording of it; you can hear Kylie (or a friend) say, \"Is that Daddy, Stormi?\" A voice that's unmistakably Kylie's warns Stormi not to push too many buttons on the phone. \"Be careful, baby, don't pause it,\" she says as her daughter dances to the song. Could this adorable footage have been captured during that rumored family day? We don't know for sure, but we do know that Stormi's happiness and well-being are of utmost importance to Kylie and Travis.\n\nFamily time has always been important to the Scott-Jenner crew. In December, Travis told Rolling Stone that he and Kylie make sure to spend quality time with Stormi every week, even with their busy schedules. \u201cWe don\u2019t let nothing come over Stormi time. Stormi Saturdays. We don\u2019t f**k around with those. Even with me on tour, Stormi pulls up. She\u2019ll travel,\" he said.\n\nAfter news of their split surfaced, Kylie took to Twitter to clear up rumors that she'd reunited with her ex Tyga. \"Travis and i are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi \u203c\ufe0f our friendship and our daughter is priority,\" she wrote. Whether or not getting back together is in the cards for Kylie and Travis, it's clear that they'll do everything they can to make sure Stormi is happy, healthy, and loved \u2014 and that she has great dance music.\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.\n\nWant more from Teen Vogue?
