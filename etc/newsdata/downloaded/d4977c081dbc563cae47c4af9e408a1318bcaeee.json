But having the Olympics in Beijing in 2008 was a gamechanger.\n\nThat brought tennis into Asia in a big way, and when the Chinese do something, they really go for it. They have grown the game from the top-down, building some huge complexes, and now fund 25 WTA and ATP events. If the winner in Shenzhen this week wins all her round-robin matches, she could walk away with $4.75m (\u00a33.7m). That would be the biggest single payday in the sport, even outstripping the grand slams.\n\nWhen I think about what has happened with tennis in Asia, I\u2019m amazed that some other sports \u2013 cricket, for example \u2013 have shown no interest in becoming part of the Olympics. That fortnight is the single biggest global showcase that any sport can have.\n\nOver the last two years, I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time in China with the WTA\u2019s Come Play programme. The idea is to develop a tennis workforce of schoolteachers and coaches.", "description": "I\u2019m in Shenzhen this week for the WTA Finals \u2013 an event which underlines the importance of the Olympic Games in spreading the gospel of sport.", "authors": ["Judy Murray", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214128687-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
