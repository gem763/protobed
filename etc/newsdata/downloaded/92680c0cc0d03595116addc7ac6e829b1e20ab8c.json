It also has a geographic spread, and age balance,\" Ndlozi said. According to Ndlozi, all those who made the cut went through a rigorous democratic process, that included being subjected to an internal secret ballot from EFF leader Julius Malema.\n\n\"It has continuity and change, meaning it has retained hardworking fighters and added young revolutionaries, particularly from the Fees Must Fall movement. Thus, it is constituted by a tried and tested collective of fighters, who have cut their teeth on the picket lines of the economic emancipation movement.\"", "description": "The EFF has revealed its national list and it comprises young party leaders who could join the National Assembly after the general elections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4648/b1309751aed84088a5c015c3a28be3a6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-13"}
