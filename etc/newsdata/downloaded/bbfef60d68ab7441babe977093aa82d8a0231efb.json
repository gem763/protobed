At one elementary school, in particular, this meant setting up benches for the young kids to get to lunch safely.\n\nA teacher at Durham Elementary School in Houston, Texas took a video of students hobbling across blue benches that sat in what appears to be a foot of water on Thursday. In the video, the educator, whose identity is not known, is heard saying, \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna believe this.\u201d\n\nAccording to Storyful, where she uploaded the video anonymously, the teacher and her colleagues were worried about the children being cold and wet throughout the day after the rain started to come down earlier that morning. In an attempt to keep the children comfortable and dry, one of her coworkers started making a bridge out of the benches in the hallway.\n\n\u201cThe video was taken to share the circumstances that the students and faculty face every time it rains. It showed teachers jumping into action and doing what was necessary to make sure those students felt safe and secure,\u201d she shared to Storyful. \u201cThe students are the priority and nothing else mattered in that moment.\u201d\n\nThe teacher went on to explain that the unbelievable incident wasn\u2019t an isolated one. Instead, she said that the Houston Independent School District (HISD) has \u201coverlooked\u201d Durham Elementary despite multiple efforts to get a bond for a new school building to replace their current 50-year-old structure.\n\n\u201cWhen will these students become a priority for HISD like they are for the staff and community who pour into these children each and every day?\u201d she asked.\n\nHISD provided the following statement to Yahoo Lifestyle about the severe weather and its impact on schools in the district:\n\nAll HISD schools and offices are closed and classes are canceled for Friday, September 20 to allow our students and staff time to recover from the conditions resulting from Tropical Storm Imelda and prepare our buildings. Schools and offices are expected to reopen and classes to resume as usual on Monday, September 23.\n\nIn response to the district\u2019s school closures announcement on Twitter, students and parents said that HISD should be \u201cashamed\u201d for waiting until Friday to call school off.\n\nAfter all the damage done y'all finally close \ud83d\udc4c You all should be ashamed of yourselves and every car that flooded trying to make it to your schools where their child was stranded should sue you all for damage. \u2014 Ecklecia Morris (@Ecklecia) September 20, 2019\n\nGee. Thanks. So much. Thanks so much for doing the bare minimum and not endangering your students\u2019 lives a second time. \u2014 McKenzie (@kashxkenzie) September 20, 2019\n\nI wasn't going anyway pic.twitter.com/S6w1BO97XE \u2014 Kevin gomez (@kevingomez0419) September 20, 2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Elementary school students in Houston, Texas are navigating their flooded hallway by walking on benches. \"Nobody's gonna believe this,\" one teacher says.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BqqOMoY9MSZz.qx00CEyBA--~B/aD0zNTA7dz02NTY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.storyful.com/2fa2f06037aab4573fc72099e70b1d9f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
