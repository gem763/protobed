Gorsuch is on the horns of a dilemma: Does he jettison his judicial philosophy to slow their progress?\n\nGorsuch, President Trump\u2019s first appointee to the Supreme Court, literally wrote the book (published last month) on judicial \u201ctextualism,\u201d the philosophy that says judges must rule on the plain meaning of the law, not legislative intent nor desired outcomes.\n\nSo he\u2019s in a corner now as the high court decides whether to bless employment discrimination against LGBTQ Americans. Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, and if you set aside cultural views on homosexuality 55 years ago and look only at the law itself, it\u2019s clear: Firing somebody for not following traditional sex stereotypes \u2014 say, a man who dates a man or a woman who was identified as male at birth \u2014 is discrimination on the basis of sex. How can sexual orientation not be about sex?\n\nGorsuch acknowledged as much during Tuesday\u2019s argument, telling David Cole, lawyer for the transgender plaintiff (the cases involve both transgender and gay discrimination), to \u201cassume for the moment I\u2019m with you on the textual evidence. It\u2019s close, okay? We\u2019re not talking about extra-textual stuff.\u201d\n\nBut then the justice pivoted in a decidedly non-textual direction. He asked whether judges should \u201ctake into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision, and the possibility that Congress didn\u2019t think about it?\u201d\n\nWhat? This from the guy who just wrote that judges shouldn\u2019t \u201cdo anything other than interpret statutes according to the ordinary meaning of their terms,\u201d who ridiculed attempts to divine legislative intent from the \u201cflotsam\u201d of history, and who derided \u201cconsequentialists\u201d who \u201cseek to select the outcome calculated to produce optimal policy results\u201d?\n\nNow, he\u2019s asking about congressional intent and policy results. That\u2019s a good bit of intellectual chicanery.\n\nGorsuch invited Cole to contemplate a \u201cdrastic\u201d change to gender-neutral bathrooms and dress codes (neither of which was at issue in Tuesday\u2019s cases). When Cole said available evidence so far finds \u201cno upheaval,\u201d Gorsuch shot back: \u201cDid you want to address [the] arguments or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was,\u201d Cole said.\n\nHe was. But Gorsuch didn\u2019t want to hear it. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia already forbid LGBTQ discrimination. Where is Gorsuch\u2019s imagined cataclysm?\n\nAnd surely Gorsuch knows his other non-textualist argument, that the matter is a \u201clegislative rather than a judicial function,\u201d is a dodge. Has he met Congress? It can\u2019t pass a resolution at 8 a.m. proclaiming it morning.\n\nOther conservatives \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 kept their cards close, while a fiery Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg schooled Trump administration solicitor general Noel Francisco on case law. \u201cI guess I\u2019m thinking of the wrong case,\u201d he said when Ginsburg corrected him. When Francisco counseled against interpreting the law to protect gay people, she reminded him: \u201cNo one ever thought sexual harassment was encompassed by discrimination on the basis of sex back in \u201964.\u201d\n\nOutside the court, a large group of LGBTQ-rights activists dominated a small contingent bearing signs saying \u201cF--- DOOM NATIONS,\u201d and \u201cGOD HATES PRIDE.\u201d Discrimination\u2019s defenders inside were more genteel. Francisco and John Bursch, arguing against the transgender woman, Aimee Stephens, avoided calling her \u201cshe.\u201d Bursch declared that \u201ctreating women and men equally does not mean employers have to treat men as women.\u201d\n\nJustice Samuel Alito floated the strained hypothetical of an employer who can\u2019t discern an employee\u2019s gender. \u201cSo this is \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 Pat?\u201d asked Pamela S. Karlan, lawyer for the gay plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not familiar with that,\u201d said Alito.\n\nGorsuch was in no mood for merriment. He competed with Justice Sonia Sotomayor for the floor, interrupted an exchange between Ginsburg and the solicitor general, and retorted to Justice Elena Kagan when she broke in on his questioning of Bursch. \u201cThat\u2019s helpful,\u201d he told her, \u201cbut I\u2019m also curious what you have to say, Mr. Bursch.\u201d\n\nWhen Karlan offered a hypothetical about requiring women arguing before the court to wear \u201cHooters outfits,\u201d Gorsuch belittled the \u201cabsurd example.\u201d When she elaborated, he interjected: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m getting at, and you know what I\u2019m getting at.\u201d He pressed her testily and at length on bathroom use by transgender people, leading her to remind him her clients are gay, not transgender.\n\nGorsuch could be a problem for those seeking to preserve discrimination. That might be why one lawyer for the cause, Jeffrey Harris, struggled when Gorsuch pointed out that the \u201clanguage of the statute\u201d broadly defines \u201cthe causes of discrimination.\u201d\n\nHarris rambled, then lost his train of thought: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, remind me of the question one more time?\u201d\n\nThe question is whether Gorsuch will interpret the text of the law the way he claims to \u2014 or devise an excuse to produce his desired result.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The Trump-appointed justice could be a problem for those seeking to preserve discrimination against the LGBTQ community.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "October At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
