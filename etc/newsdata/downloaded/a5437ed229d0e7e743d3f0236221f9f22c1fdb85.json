They have been able to choose the 31 best available players their countries can provide to take on the task of winning the title: they have at their disposal vast amounts of data and analysis on the strengths and weaknesses of prospective opponents.\n\nYet, still they stir and their slumbers are disturbed by the echo of shrill whistles and by flashing colors, red and yellow.\n\nTheir own planning has left nothing to chance but a major factor outside their control - refereeing - troubled coaches before the tournament began, and has grown in magnitude through the first two weeks.\n\nAs the World Cup approached there were fears of the potential effect on the tournament of the hard line officiating which has become the norm in international rugby. High tackles or even accidental contact with the head has been been treated with zero tolerance.\n\nMany commentators and some coaches worried that if referees applied the same standard throughout the World Cup the tournament might see an unprecedented flurry of red and yellow cards. Yet in the initial group-stage matches it seemed referees were taking an unusually light hand as a number of incidents which would typically result in censure went unpunished.\n\nThe tackle by Wallabies winger Reece Hodge on Fiji flanker Peceli Yato, which later resulted in Hodge being suspended for three games, was at first not deemed actionable by the match officials.\n\nFrance backrower Louis Picamoles was offside when he claimed a vital intercept in his team\u2019s important pool match against Argentina.\n\nThe brilliant opening match between South Africa and New Zealand saw a number of incidents which did not result in any sanction. All Blacks captain Kieran Read and prop Joe Moody both made high challenges on Springbok players, and South Africa winger Makazoli Mapimpi seemed to get away with a brazen professional foul.\n\nIrish prop Tadhg Furlong wasn\u2019t penalized over a ruck incident which resulted in Scotland flanker Hamish Watson sustaining a tournament-ending knee injury. In several cases there seemed to be a breakdown in communication between on-field and television match officials.\n\nWorld Rugby appeared to share the view of many that refereeing in the first week was \u201cnot consistently of the standards set by World Rugby and themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cElite match officials are required to make decisions in complex, high-pressure situations and there have been initial challenges with the use of technology and team communication which have impacted decision-making,\u201d World Rugby said in a statement. \u201cThese are already being addressed by the team of 23 match officials to enhance consistency.\u201d\n\nThe result has been a sharp spike in the number of players receiving cards or being subsequently cited. Four players - Hodge, Samoa\u2019s Rey Lee-Lo and Motu Matu\u2019u and the U.S. forward John Quill - have received three week bans for high tackles.\n\nCoaches are still not happy. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt said he might complain to World Rugby about the refereeing in his team\u2019s shock loss to Japan.\n\n\u201cI certainly understand the frustrations of some of the players and in discussing things with them, based on what I saw on the monitor, it\u2019s not too dissimilar from the last time we had this referee,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nWallabies coach Michael Cheika said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the penalty awarded against his center, Samu Kerevi, for a fend as he ran into a tackler in Australia\u2019s loss to Wales. Cheika feared referees had been \u201cspooked\u201d by the World Rugby statement.\n\n\u201cEverybody seems worried,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all worried about stuff so much.\n\n\u201cI am not sure why they are worried, the players aren\u2019t worried. Then it\u2019s affecting everything else on the field.\u201d\n\nAll Blacks assistant Ian Foster said coaches were worried about the potential \u201cdouble whammy\u201d of a card and suspension for any player deemed to have made an illegal tackle. He said with squads restricted to 31 players, those decisions could affect a team\u2019s chance of progressing to the knockout rounds.\n\nThe group stage isn\u2019t quite halfway through a 40-game schedule, then the knockouts start with quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the double whammy that gets you so we\u2019re not only seeing more cards, we\u2019re also seeing longer suspensions,\u201d Foster said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the thing that will have the biggest impact on the tournament.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If Rugby World Cup coaches lie awake in the darkest watches of the night, amid a turmoil of bedclothes, it might be because of a single nagging fear which presses on their restive minds.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Mcmorran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/japan_rugby_wcup_england_usa_27246_c0-154-2000-1320_s1770x1032.jpg?6ee9fe86a1f270fb9532e9bb86095c4b34f9b88f", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
