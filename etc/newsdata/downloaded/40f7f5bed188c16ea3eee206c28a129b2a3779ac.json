There have been no reports so far about Christian deaths.\n\nThey also said the US withdrawal would embolden Iran, a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and an enemy of Israel.\n\nSyrians flee shelling by Turkish forces in Ras al Ayn, northeast Syria, on October 9, 2019.

Both Democrat & Republican leaders are deeply concerned bc this would be, in essence, abandoning our closest allies there \u2014 the Kurdish people.\"\n\n\"Also pray for the Christians who the Kurds have been protecting. They could be annihilated,\" he added. \"Would you pray w/me that Pres. @realDonaldTrump will reconsider?
