In a campaign ad last week, McConnell signaled to voters that he intends to protect Trump from Democrats\u2019 efforts to remove him.\n\nThe White House outlined in a defiant eight-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Democrats on Tuesday why it will not participate in their \u201cillegitimate and unconstitutional\u201d impeachment inquiry, charging that the proceedings have run roughshod over congressional norms and the president's due-process rights.\n\nWHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nTrump administration officials called the letter, which was written by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and obtained by Fox News, perhaps the most historic letter the White House has sent. The document tees up a head-on collision with Democrats in Congress, who have fired off a slew of subpoenas in recent days concerning the president's alleged effort to get Ukraine to investigate political foe Joe Biden during a July phone call with Ukraine's leader.\n\nREAD THE WHITE HOUSE LETTER\n\nRay said that Pelosi had previously claimed she would not pursue impeachment unless there was bipartisan support to do it.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s now pursuing what she said she wouldn\u2019t do. The process itself is intentionally designed both to be speedy and to exclude Republican input,\u201d Ray said.\n\nThe document came as the White House aggressively has parried Democrats' inquiry efforts. One of the administration's first moves: the State Department on Tuesday barred Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, from appearing before a House panel conducting the probe into Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIf it really ultimately is perceived by the American people as being a partisan effort then the only conclusion one could draw is that it is simply an effort by the Democrats to impact the results of the 2020 election,\u201d Ray said, pointing out that the nation's founders specifically intended for impeachment to be successful in the Senate only on a bipartisan basis.\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re and John Roberts contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Whitewater independent counsel Robert Ray told \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d\u00a0Wednesday that a \"single-party impeachment inquiry\" by Democrats against President Trump would not make it through the Senate.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-11.26.18-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
