The character simply evaporated from the Lyons\u2019s world \u2014 except for one brief conversation that seemed engineered to explain his disappearance.\n\nIn that scene, Jamal\u2019s mother, Cookie Lyon (Taraji P. Henson), is sitting in her kitchen with Becky Williams (Gabourey Sidibe), a good friend of Jamal\u2019s and a former employee of the Empire Entertainment media company. They\u2019re both in slumber party attire (Cookie is wearing a sleep mask pulled up above her forehead). When Cookie pokes fun at Becky\u2019s cat-covered pink onesie, Becky says it\u2019s the kind of outfit she used to wear to sleepovers with Jamal.\n\n\u201cNo wonder that boy ran off to London,\u201d Cookie jokes.\n\n\u201cI thought he was running away from Lyon drama,\u201d Becky says, pausing before she gets serious. \u201cI really miss him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t get me started; I miss him so much,\u201d Cookie replies, before quickly diverting the conversation. \u201cAnyway, why do we need to have this slumber party?\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Arts Television Jussie-Smollett-Empire.Html"], "top_image": ""}
