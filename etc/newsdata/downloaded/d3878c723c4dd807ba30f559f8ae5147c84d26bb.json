They also think the media is biased against the White House and the president.\n\nAll the same, they think they\u2019re losing the public battle and that Trump\u2019s lack of discipline is hurting them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cDoes he need to be so unhinged? He says the dumbest things,\u201d said one Republican senator who vented frustration with the president\u2019s outbursts on Twitter and in front of the White House press corps.\n\n\u201cYeah, there needs to be a coordinated response to everything. There needs to be a coordinated effort to just shut up,\u201d the senator said.\n\nGOP lawmakers say that President Trump and his political team need to overhaul their strategy to regain momentum and prevent their party from losing the White House and a number of congressional seats next fall.\n\nThey say the White House\u2019s efforts so far not only could limit Trump to one term, but could spell doom for vulnerable Senate GOP incumbents such as Sens.

However, you have to be very careful to not prohibit Donald Trump from being Donald Trump and that\u2019s the risk you run when you start institutionalizing these things,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer Kevin John CramerGOP worries it's losing impeachment fight Trump allies mull how to quickly quash impeachment articles McConnell has complicated history on impeachment MORE (R-N.D.).\n\nBut Cramer said Trump\u2019s unpredictability makes it tougher for GOP allies to defend the president.\n\n\u201cThe reason it\u2019s difficult is sometimes he changes in midstream and when that happens you find yourself out on a limb that has suddenly been cut off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of that sort of institutional discipline does make it more difficult for the rest of us, if you will, as we\u2019re trying to carry his message.\u201d\n\nThune on Thursday expressed his hope the White House messaging operation would become more organized in the weeks ahead.\n\n\u201cIt always is an advantage to make sure that you are as organized, prepared and coordinated as you possibly can be.
