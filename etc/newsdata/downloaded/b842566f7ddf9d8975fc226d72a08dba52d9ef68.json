Two years after that first Young Rich List, the unfamiliar phrase \"social media\" entered the language. The iPhone followed in 2007. Now the IT crowd makes a consistent third of the 100-strong Young Rich, and few of the rest are unaffected. Out of 13 retailers on the list, for example, 10 operate only online.\n\nDollar-wise, the rankings remain dominated by Australia's biggest tech stars Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar of Atlassian, who make up half its record $23.5 billion worth.\n\nBut the rest of the Young Rich \u2013 a dozen of them still in their 20s \u2013 have also seen a surge in wealth. Even without the Atlassian pair, the average Young Rich fortune has risen 30 per cent to $95 million, driven by revenue growth and new rounds of funding.\n\nJohn Ilhan, the late mobile phone king who topped the first list, would place only 16th in the 2018 ranks even after adjusting his fortune to today's dollars. And six of this year's Young Rich would now immediately enter the Financial Review's main Rich List \u2013 Australia's richest 200 people regardless of age \u2013 accelerating the graduation from the Young Rich into another generation of established Australian wealth.\n\nPopular narrative\n\nWealth-making skill has made the Young Rich prosper much faster than the rest of Australia. But the absolute wealth gap between the very top and very bottom is not the lived experience of most Australians. New analysis of the evidence by the Productivity Commission shows that Australia's 27 years of growth has flowed evenly to make everyone better off, and makes nonsense out of the popular narrative of rising inequality.\n\nAFR magazine Young Rich cover Damian Bennett\n\nIt's not all progress on the list. The statistic that grates is the decline in the number of women. But changing attitudes in the venture capital business mean more women are likely to appear in future lists. And there are no safety nets. Joel Macdonald of GetSwift has seen his wealth fall along with the company's share price while Matt Berriman leaves the list after Unlockd went into voluntary administration in the past 12 months.\n\nThis List represents the \"One Per Cent\" demonised by many. But the people on it have grabbed at chances to create something out of nothing. They have increased their wealth, and on paper increased the national inequality that Labor claims is at a 70-year high. But in the real world everyone is better for it. Only a much wealthier Australia could have made a $486 million fortune for fitness moguls Kayla Itsines and Tobi Pearce, featured on today's page 1, buying the kind of lifestyles and experiences that our parents and grandparents could not afford.
