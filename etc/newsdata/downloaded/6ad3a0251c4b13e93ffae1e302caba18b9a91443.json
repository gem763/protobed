She was in New York last week for the climate change march.\n\n\"Last Friday over 4 million people striked for the climate. This Friday we do it again. 170 countries and 6383 events so far in #weekforfuture,\" Thunberg tweeted.\n\nKenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCozzoli/Fotogramma/Ropi via ZUMA Press\n\nChristopher Katsarov/AP\n\nThunberg's activism has drawn the ire of conservatives, including President Donald Trump. After Thunberg spoke at the UN, Trump said, \"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.

Knowles called Thunberg \"mentally ill\" on its network.\n\nChristopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press via AP\n\nVALERIE BLUM/EPA-EFE/REX\n\nAntonio Masiello/Getty Images\n\nMiguel Tona/EPA-EFE/REX\n\nAttila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSHAWN THEW/EPA-EFE/REX\n\nHandout/Reuters\n\nKenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMinas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\n\nAntonio Masiello/Getty Images", "description": "Tens of thousands participated in the global Climate Strike Friday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/climate-01-as-gty-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
