It seems like a decent support base is forming near the $9,350 and $9,400 levels. The price climbed above the $9,500 and $9,520 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a close above the $9,500 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more gains above $9,550.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoin gained pace above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last key decline from the $10,293 high to $9,316 low. However, the price is now struggling to break the $9,800 resistance area (the previous support). Moreover, it seems like the 50% Fib retracement level of the last key decline from the $10,293 high to $9,316 low is acting as a strong resistance.\n\nOn the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $9,900 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Above the trend line, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last key decline from the $10,293 high to $9,316 low is at $9,920. However, the main resistance is near the $10,000 level, above which the price is likely to move back into a positive zone.\n\nOn the downside, an initial support is near the $9,660 level (the recent resistance area). The next key support is near the $9,600 level and the 100 hourly SMA. If there is a downside break below the 100 hourly SMA, the price could revisit the $9,350 support area in the near term.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin price is facing a lot of hurdles near the $9,800, $9,900 and $10,000 levels. It seems like the bulls could attempt to push the price above $10,000. If they fail, the price will most likely start a fresh decline towards $9,500 or $9,350.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is slowly losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is correcting lower towards the 60 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $9,660 followed by $9,500.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $9,800, $9,900 and $10,000.", "description": "Bitcoin price is facing a lot of barriers near $9,900 and $10,000 against the US Dollar.
