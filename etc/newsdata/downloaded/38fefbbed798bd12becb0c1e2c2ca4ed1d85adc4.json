Westpac dropped 0.9 per cent to $28.73 and ANZ fell one third of a per cent to close at $27.93.\n\nThe event likely to weigh on Australian equities when trade opens on Wednesday is Tuesday evening's speech from the Reserve bank governor Philip Lowe.\n\nThe talk from Australia's top central banker is expected to give a read on the RBA's appetite for further rate cuts and the use unconventional monetary policy to support the economy.", "description": "ASX edges higher with a lift in the IT sector, marking the seventh straight day of gains.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e7ade4faa3ad373accbdb3d64d9ba3051134f3a8", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
