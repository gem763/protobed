(AP) - There was plenty of blame to go around after Oakland\u2019s stunning loss to Kansas City, one that prevented the Athletics from adding on to their lead in the AL wild-card race.\n\nA costly error in the ninth inning by center fielder Ramon Laureano. Manager Bob Melvin\u2019s decision to lift hot-hitting first baseman Matt Olson for a pinch-runner an inning earlier.\n\nLiam Hendriks pointed the finger at himself.\n\nBrett Phillips hit a tying home run off Hendricks in the ninth, Adalberto Mondesi followed with an RBI double and the Kansas City Royals beat Oakland 6-5 on Monday night to end the Athletics\u2019 six-game winning streak.\n\n\u201cIt felt like I was making some pitches when I needed to but not enough,\u201d Hendriks said. \u201cI fell behind a couple times and had to kind of groove them a fastball. At the end of the day I didnt get the job done and the team paid for it.\u201d\n\nOakland\u2019s lead over Tampa Bay for the top AL wild card was cut to one game. Cleveland is 1 1/2 games behind the Rays.\n\nKhris Davis\u2019 RBI single off Kevin McCarthy (4-2) gave Oakland a 5-4 lead in the eighth.\n\nPhillips homered on a 2-0 fastball from Hendriks (4-3) with one out in the ninth, Hendriks\u2019 sixth blown save in 28 chances.\n\n\u201cBall was down the middle to Phillips and Mondesi hit a pretty good pitch the other way for a double,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cHe\u2019s been absolutely fantastic for us. Every now and then you\u2019re going to blow a save.\u201d\n\nWhit Merrifield reached when Laureano allowed his drive to pop out of the pocket of his glove at the front of the warning track for an error. Mondesi sliced an opposite-field double to left.\n\n\u201cJust looked like he turned around and once he turned back around he just picked it up a little late,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nMarcus Semien singled leading off the bottom half for Oakland but Ian Kennedy retired his next three batters for his 30th save in 35 chances, giving the Royals\u2018 Ned Yost his 1,200th win in 16 seasons as a major league manager.\n\nKennedy struck out Chad Pinder to end it. Pinder had replaced Olson in the batting order.\n\nAt 56-95, the Royals are trying to avoid their second straight 100-loss season.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good team over there,\u201d Yost said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fall back four runs early because you knows runs are going to be tough to come by.\u201d\n\nJorge Soler homered leading off the fourth, tying injured Los Angeles Angels star Mike Trout for the AL lead with his 45th home run.\n\nAlex Gordon had two RBIs.\n\nDEFENSIVE DIMES\n\nLaureano made back-to-back strong throws to the plate in the first, including one on the fly, to keep Mondesi at third after Mondesi\u2019s RBI triple.\n\nONE MORE THAN RICKEY\n\nSemien\u2019s home run was his 29th while batting first in the order, breaking the A\u2019s record he shared with Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, who watched the game in lower box seats. \u201cI thought it was cool that he was here today, too, just sitting right behind home plate,\u201d Semien said.\n\nROUGH STARTS\n\nOakland starter Tanner Roark struck out eight in 4 2/3 innings but allowed four runs and seven hits. Kansas City\u2019s Glenn Sparkman also had a short night and allowed four runs in 4 1/3 innings. He threw two wild pitches and hit a batter.\n\nBEGINNING OF THE END\n\nThere were concerns the game might be postponed due to field conditions following an NFL game Sunday and rain Monday. The infield still had football markings and there were large dark patches of dead grass in center field, which bore the weight of stands that were removed overnight. It\u2019s the final time the A\u2019s will have to deal with the situation after having shared the Coliseum with the Oakland Raiders since 1995. The Raiders won\u2019t play at the Coliseum again until Nov. 3, well after the A\u2019s season has ended, and are moving to Las Vegas next year.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAthletics: RHP Mike Fiers is getting further testing for nerve irritation in his right arm but the A\u2019s are hopeful their top pitcher can throw a bullpen Tuesday and won\u2019t have to miss his turn in the rotation.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nA\u2019s LHP Brett Anderson (12-9, 4.07 ERA) has already set a career high for wins going into Tuesday\u2019s start against the Royals. RHP Jorge L\u00f3pez (4-7, 6.09) is riding a three-game road winning streak for Kansas City.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There was plenty of blame to go around after Oakland's stunning loss to Kansas City, one that prevented the Athletics from adding on to their lead in the AL wild-card race.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Wagaman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/royals_athletics_baseball_08880_c78-0-4340-2485_s1770x1032.jpg?5f31f9e48deb23568cabb16ddb43c6c307cb78af", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
