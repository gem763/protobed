He had an eye for good ideas, investing early on in Twitter, Kickstarter and Flickr, but it was his mastery of cultivating relationships that was especially valuable to the lab.\n\nReid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn, once said Mr. Ito \u201cmakes well-networked professionals look like hermits.\u201d His mentors include Lawrence Lessig, the influential law professor and founder of Creative Commons, the nonprofit advocate for public intellectual property rights, where Mr. Ito was once chief executive. His online photo albums include pictures of the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the astronaut Leland Melvin and the filmmaker J. J. Abrams, a \u201cdirector\u2019s fellow\u201d at the lab. And when Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, toured the United States last year \u2014 before the death of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u2014 he attended a reception at the Media Lab.\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that Mr. Ito would meet Mr. Epstein, another prolific networker. Both men attended the 1999 Billionaires\u2019 Dinner, an annual event put on by the literary agent John Brockman, and belonged to the invitation-only Trilateral Commission in 2003.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Ito said he had met Mr. Epstein in a hotel lobby during a conference in 2013, five years after Mr. Epstein\u2019s plea in Florida. Mr. Epstein long cultivated relationships with celebrity scientists, many of whom Mr. Ito also knew, and eagerly associated himself with the Media Lab. In 2014, he issued news releases about donations to restore Mark Rothko murals on the campus and teach coding to 5-year-olds. (The Media Lab later called those statements inaccurate.)\n\nThe lab served as an avenue for Mr. Epstein to seek connections to the wider tech world.\n\nElizabeth Stark, the chief executive of the cryptocurrency start-up Lightning Labs, was not affiliated with the lab but knew Mr. Ito and several others there. When she was raising money for her company in 2015, someone at the lab contacted her and offered to invest Mr. Epstein\u2019s money. Ms. Stark found a news article about Mr. Epstein\u2019s history and turned it down.\n\n\u201cIn five minutes I was able to Google and make a determination that seemed like such a no-brainer,\u201d she said.", "description": "The proudly contrarian lab has been divided since its director disclosed that he had taken money from the disgraced financier.
