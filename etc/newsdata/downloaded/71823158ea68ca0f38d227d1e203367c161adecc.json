'UEFA were definitely on alert and the fourth official and the referee and linesmen were on alert,' he said. 'So I think it's as big an operation as there has been.\n\n'The sad reality is that we weren't able to stop incidents happening, so now the investigation has to ensure we can take that next step, because it's remarkable to have such a spotlight on a game and still see all that happen.'\n\nKane suggested Bulgaria should be prevented from playing in Sofia, adding: 'Maybe that's a step forward.'\n\nThe extent of what appeared to be a premediated attack on England players was laid bare on Tuesday after sources confirmed to Sportsmail that spotters saw at least 20 stadium staff and stewards working at the game remove their official bibs before joining in the racial abuse of England's black players. Hardcore fans asking to work as security during matches is not uncommon in eastern Europe.\n\nThe Bulgarian FA and authorities took some responsibility for Monday's awful scenes on Tuesday after Mihaylov had resigned.\n\nBulgarian FA president Borislav Mihaylov has resigned following the unsavoury scenes\n\nUEFA'S THREE-STEP PROTOCOL 1 - The referee will speak to the stadium announcer and demand the halting of racist behaviour. 2 - If it continues, the referee can take the players off the field into the dressing rooms for a period of time and the stadium announcer will make another address. 3 - If it still continues, the match will be abandoned.\n\nEarlier in the day, Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov called on Mihaylov to step down while the football headquarters was raided by police as the nation sought to stem the damage caused during the 6-0 loss to England.\n\nBefore England's squad meet up again next month, Southgate and FA chiefs will make personal checks on players and staff who were targeted.\n\nDespite unprecedented scenes during the first half, when the game was halted twice, the atmosphere at half-time was calm.\n\nAll players and staff were so well prepared for the racist jibes that there was no panic in the dressing room as the players decided their next course of action.\n\nSouthgate led the discussions at half-time, while skipper Kane also addressed the team.\n\nEngland manager Southgate speaks to the referee during the ugly scenes on Monday\n\nBREAKDOWN OF EVENTS IN ENGLAND'S 6-0 WIN IN BULGARIA The game was halted TWICE as home fans abuse black players, brandish 'No Respect' shirts and make Nazi salutes in planned racist onslaught\n\nTyrone Mings reveals vile chants started before kick-off in Bulgaria\n\nMarcus Rashford praises 'courage' of Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov for appealing to fans at half-time to stop racist taunting of England players\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate considered taking his players off the pitch against Bulgaria as FA chairman Greg Clarke condemns racist taunting\n\nBulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov claimed not to have heard any chanting and said in his post-match press conference: 'The unacceptable behaviour was by England fans.'\n\nIan Wright says England players taking action against racism made him 'feel really good'\n\nRaheem Sterling calls out Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov for saying England have a bigger racism problem than his own country and posts funny Ainsley Harriott meme in response to Piers Morgan hailing his performance in face of vile racist abuse\n\nUEFA will use evidence from specialist 'spotters' in the crowd and TV footage to prosecute after Bulgarian fans' appalling racist taunts\n\nBulgaria's prime minister has called on the president of their FA to quit over the racist incidents\n\nAlthough it was unanimously agreed that they did not want to abandon the game, the players decided that if there were further incidents in the second half, England would walk off. Such was the concern that some in the dressing room believed the match would not be completed.\n\nAt full-time, Southgate spoke to his players and staff in the dressing room, praising them for their unity and maturity.\n\nThe ugly scenes in Bulgaria were discussed in Parliament on Tuesday. FA chief executive Mark Bullingham met Damian Collins, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, at Westminster where the events in Sofia were on the agenda. Bullingham also spoke to Sports Minister Nigel Adams on the phone, specifically about the racist taunts. The conversation led to Adams writing to UEFA demanding the governing body take urgent action.\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Ceferin tried to re-affirm the organisation's commitment to tacking racism. 'UEFA's sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist,' he insisted.\n\n'Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments need to do more in this area. Only by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.'", "description": "England manager Gareth Southgate and captain Harry Kane have called on European football's governing body to mete out the strongest possible sanctions to the Bulgarians.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel", "Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760146-0-image-a-15_1571174245581.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
