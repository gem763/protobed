Lawyers say the housing companies used Facebook\u2019s advertising algorithm to systematically weed out older prospective tenants.\n\nLawyers representing the Housing Rights Initiative and Opiotennione said Facebook allowed advertisers to set parameters on the age of users who would see their housing ads, thereby limiting the people who knew the residences were available to rent.\n\n\u201cIf an advertisement is only sent to persons 22 to 55-years-old, no one older than 55-years-old will receive the ad,\u201d they stated in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit finds seven companies \u2015 whose combined ownership includes hundreds of apartment buildings \u2015 legally culpable for housing discrimination. The companies cited in the lawsuit are Bozzuto, Greystar, Kettler, Wood Partners, Fairfield Residential, Fore Property and The Tower Companies.\n\nIn their filings Wednesday, lawyers include examples of allegedly discriminatory Facebook ads alongside screenshots of a feature that shows Facebook users why they are seeing certain ads on the social network.\n\nHuffPost Lawyers allege housing ads like this, which were promoted to Facebook users ages 28 to 45, discriminate against older prospective residents who are excluded from seeing them.\n\nBecause of the advertising algorithm, older residents who fall within those age parameters are still less likely than younger residents to see the accused companies\u2019 housing ads.\n\n\u201c[I]t is likely that the ad delivery algorithm will result in persons in their 20s or 30s being more likely than persons in their late 40s or early 50s to receive the ads,\u201d they wrote.\n\nPeter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer at Outten & Golden representing the plaintiffs, said companies must find better ways to pursue their business interests without discrimination.\n\n\u201cThe idea of promoting equality in the digital sphere doesn\u2019t have to be in conflict with a business prerogative,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nIt\u2019s a point Romer-Friedman has argued successfully in the past. In March, he and his firm reached a settlement with Facebook over charges the social media giant allowed advertisers to exclude African Americans and Jews from seeing certain ads. At the time, Facebook agreed to be more transparent about its ad targeting practices and suspend the ability to target specific races and religions with housing, employment and credit ads. Later that month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development charged Facebook with racial discrimination.\n\nWednesday\u2019s lawsuit doesn\u2019t name Facebook as a defendant, instead laying the bulk of responsibility at the feet of the housing companies who purchased the ads.\n\nCivil rights advocates have been sounding the alarm about potential discrimination in online advertising for years, citing Facebook specifically. For that reason, Romer-Friedman said businesses purportedly engaging in these practices should expect lawsuits like the one unveiled Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to these companies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe discrimination complaints were filed through the Offices of Human Rights for both Washington, D.C., and Maryland County. The plaintiffs are represented by the firms Outten & Golden and Handley Farrah & Anderson.\n\nFacebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Apartment building owners are accused of keeping older people from seeing listings for available units.
