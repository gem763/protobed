They add few or no calories to the foods they flavor and generally do not raise blood sugar levels.\n\nBecause they can be made from natural ingredients such as herbs (Stevia, Truvia), fruits and berries (sugar alcohols like sorbitol often used in chewing gum) as well as synthesized from chemicals (saccharin, aspartame), they are now called \"nonnutritive sweeteners.\"\n\nWhatever they are called, these sweeteners are \"ubiquitous\" in the products we consume, Baker-Smith said, and it can be hard to people to pick them out.\n\n\"First you have to read the ingredient list,\" she said, \"and then you have to know the names of all the different sweeteners. Do people really recognize aspartame and acesulfame potassium?\"\n\nOne 2014 study found parents were unable to identify these nonnutritive sweeteners in 77% of the products they were shown.\n\nFDA approved sweeteners\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has approved six high-intensity sweeteners as food additives: saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), sucralose, neotame and advantame.\n\nStevia and Luo Han Guo (a super-sweet extract of monk fruit) are being allowed under the GRAS (generally recognized as safe) determination. However, stevia leaf and crude stevia extracts are not considered GRAS and do not have FDA approval.\n\nTruvia and Stevia are made from a highly refined stevia leaf extract which is blended with sugar alcohols or powders made from corn, rice, potato or wheat.\n\nCyclamate and its salts, such as calcium cyclamate, sodium cyclamate, magnesium cyclamate, and potassium cyclamate, are banned in the United States due to concern over an increased risk of cancer in animals.\n\nHowever, cyclamates are approved for use in more than 100 other countries, including food trade partners such as Mexico and Canada. They are often found in jellies, baked goods, soft drinks, chocolate, candies, breakfast cereals, salad dressing and toothpaste.\n\nHow much are you eating?\n\nEven if a parent recognizes a name from this alphabet soup of products, Baker-Smith said, it's then impossible to discover how much sweetener is in each serving.\n\n\"The amount per serving is not listed on product labels, so you don't actually know how much sweetener a child is eating,\" she said.\n\nIn their new guidance statement, the AAP is calling for manufacturers to do a better job of labeling these nonnutritive sweetners\n\n\"And the FDA should require manufactuers to list the amount of nonnutritive sweetener a product contains on labels,\" Baker-Smith said. \"That would help families and researchers understand how just how much is actually being consumed.\"\n\nThe FDA has set limits on the amount of each sweetener that a 132-pound person should consume each day.\n\nFor example, you should only consume nine packets of Truvia, PureVia and Enliten a day; Splenda, Sweet One, Sunett and Newtame, are maxed out at 23 packets each day. You can eat 75 packets of Nutrasweet, Equal or Sugar Twin.\n\nWhile an adult of 132 lbs would have to eat a lot of non-caloric foods to reach that limit, young children do not weigh that much.\n\n\"And besides, it's a cumulative exposure right?\" Baker-Smith asked. \"If I start eating these at three and keep eating them until I'm 60, we don't know what the long-term exposure might be.\n\n\"Some would argue that we've been using these for decades now,\" she said, \"but I still say that we just don't have the research to know, either way.\"\n\nReaction from industry\n\nThe International Sweeteners Association, an industry trade group, sent CNN a statement, which read in part: \"Research at (a) global level confirms that low/no calorie sweeteners' intake remains well below the individual sweetener Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) among the general population, in both children and adults.\"\n\nRegulatory agencies from the US, Europe and the World Health Organization have \"approved low/no calorie sweeteners for both adults and children,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Accordingly, the safety of consumers, including children, is assured by said agencies and the permitted maximum levels of low/no calorie sweeteners based on their scientific advice.\"", "description": "Food labeling of artificial sweeteners can seem like alphabet soup, leaving some parents unaware they are feeding them to their children.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120426074938-sweetener-story-top.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
