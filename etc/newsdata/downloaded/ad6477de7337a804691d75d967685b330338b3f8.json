It aired on NBC for one season between 1977 and 1978.\n\nAccording to the outlet, the show was very similar to the 1961 Robert Heinlein novel \u201cStranger in a Strange Land,\u201d which tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, the sole survivor of a Mars colony who is brought to Earth. However, Duffy told the outlet that both stories were completely different.\n\n\u201c\u2019Man from Atlantis\u2019 wasn\u2019t an adaptation,\u201d he stressed. \u201cBasically, it\u2019s a recurring theme throughout most science fiction. \u2018Man from Atlantis\u2019 was that and I loved the opportunity to examine things with virginal eyes. In other words, we get so used to saying, \u2018This is a plastic cup\u2019 or \u2018This is a recording device,\u2019 but if you were from Planet-X, you had no idea what that was. You have to learn everything and that\u2019s what \u2018Man from Atlantis' was.\u201d\n\n\u2018GILLIGAN\u2019S ISLAND\u2019 STAR TINA LOUISE SHARES HOW THE SHOW 'REPRESENTED THIS GREAT ESCAPE'\n\n\u201cIt was fun to play a superhero,\u201d Duffy continued. \u201cOn top of that, obviously it was before almost all special effects, very little green screen, so everything we had to do was invented at the time. Now I look at the tentpole major features like \u2018X-Men\u2019 and all these other things and the special effects are phenomenal. Because we didn\u2019t have that technology, if I was going to fly up somewhere, they had to hoist me up with a crane. It was fun.\u201d\n\nDuffy also shared that the series also came at the right time for audiences.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThere was the original George Reeves series ['Adventures of Superman'] where he was playing Superman,\u201d Duffy explained. \u201cThere was simultaneous to \u2018Man from Atlantis\u2019 on the air, \u2018The Six Million Dollar Man.\u2019 But we were one of the first to not just be a strong detective or policeman, but someone with actual superpowers and tried to make that on a weekly television show basis. It was obviously difficult, because we only lasted two years, but I think we were pioneers in that sense.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a clique of people who will never forget \u2018Man from Atlantis.\u2019 Usually, men come up to me and say, \u2018I was 8 years old and tried to swim like you in the pool.\u2019 So at an impressionable age, young people saw that show and never forgot it.\u201d\n\n\u2018HART TO HART\u2019 STAR STEFANIE POWERS SAYS SHE AND ROBERT WAGNER \u2018HELD EACH OTHER UP\u2019 AFTER PARTNERS\u2019 DEATHS\n\nBack in 2006, Duffy told The Guardian why he initially left \u201cDallas,\u201d which aired on CBS from 1978 until 1991.\n\n\u201cI quit because, at the end of seven years in an ensemble show with one leader, I thought, \u2018I will be known as 'Dallas' starring Larry Hagman and the cast,\u2019\u201d he explained to the UK-based outlet at the time. \u201cAnd at this point in my career \u2014 I was in my mid to late 30s \u2014 I thought, \u2018Now is the time when it\u2019s hottest for me to go out and establish my thing. So I had a meeting with Larry and with the producers. They all told me it was a really dumb choice to leave.\u201d\n\nWhen producer Leonard Katzman asked Duffy how he wanted to leave, the star said he \u201cwanted to leave a hero,\u201d but stressed he had zero intention of ever coming back.\n\n\u201cI wanted to leave knowing I couldn\u2019t come back,\u201d said Duffy. \u201cI said I wanted to leave so that it\u2019s not a trick from the audience. I didn\u2019t want to disappear, or have my plane go down in the jungle.\u201d\n\n'FAMILY MATTERS' STAR JALEEL WHITE REVEALS HOW HE FEELS ABOUT STEVE URKEL TODAY, ESCAPING CHILD STAR CURSE\n\nBobby Ewing seemingly died in the last episode of Season 8 of \"Dallas\" in 1985. And Duffy\u2019s career never took off after that.\n\n\u201cLarry would call me \u2014 he\u2019d make fun of me,\u201d recalled Duffy. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018How you likin\u2019 it out there?\u2019 I would go to see the cats. We were close socially. I got a TV movie, but nothing major.\u201d\n\nThen Duffy got a phone call that would change everything.\n\n\u201cI got home and the message light was blinking,\u201d said Duffy. \u201cIt was Larry. He said, \u2018Let\u2019s take a Jacuzzi and get drunk. I wanna talk to you.\u2019\u201d\n\n'DALLAS' STAR SHEREE J.
