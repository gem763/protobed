Celery juice has more potassium and vitamin K than tomato juice and carrot juice. However, it is lower in important nutrients like vitamin A, which is abundant in carrot juice. Unlike other vegetables that may lose polyphenols and antioxidants from the pulp or skin when juiced, Bradley said, it is unclear how much loss occurs when juicing whole celery stalks. Nevertheless, nutritionists recommend consuming a variety of vegetables and their juices because they all have their own combination of phytochemicals, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.\n\nThe salty flavour in one cup of celery juice comes from the 215 milligrams of sodium, an essential electrolyte that helps our bodies maintain a balance of fluids. The recommended dietary allowance is less than 2300 milligrams daily, but most Americans exceed that. It is a habit that can increase blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.\n\nJuicing retains the taste and concentrates the nutrients, but many preparations reduce the fibre, which nutritionists say is the best part. The juice contains 3.78 grams a cup, still far below the 25 to 30 grams recommended daily, primarily from food. Fibre helps people feel full and maintain regularity.\n\nLike kale and spinach, celery contains antioxidants and may have anti-inflammatory properties. Compared with the stalks, the leaves are more than 20 times higher in flavones, a class of flavonoids and compounds found in plants with antioxidant properties, according to a 2017 review in Advances in Nutrition.\n\nFood is complex, and just because a food is high in flavones doesn't translate into guaranteed health benefits. Compounds like flavones are modified after they are absorbed, and these modified forms might not have the same effect as what is demonstrated in preclinical studies, according to the review.\n\nFor those who were consuming few vegetables and are now drinking celery juice, nutritionists say that's a good change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is celery juice suddenly everywhere?\n\nMany credit William, who wrote a book. He shares advice with his large fan base through his podcast, his website, his New York Times best-selling books and in his contributions to Gwyneth Paltrow's site Goop.\n\nHis claims are as large as the fields of celery in California, the country's biggest producer. Nutritionists call his assertions unfounded. \"Any reputable scientist would say there's nothing here,\" said David Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University. \"And I guarantee you next year there will be some other juice or food or magical mushroom that will come out and offer these same properties.\"\n\nHowever, across the country, according to an analysis from the US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, cartons of celery were fetching $US15.05 ($22) this month, a 42.8 per cent increase from the same time the year before, although far below the high of $US73.66 in April.\n\nHow was celery used before?\n\nCelery is from the plant Apium graveolens and is a relative of carrots, parsley and cilantro. Before being cast to the bottom of the crisper, it had quite the illustrious history. Charles Davis, a plant evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, said that the Egyptians placed wild celery in King Tutankhamen's tomb in 1325 BC and that the first cultivated medicinal use of celery dates to 400 BC by the Romans.\n\nGreeks drank a wine from it, and winning athletes wore crowns of the foliage in Pan-Hellenic games. The seeds and fruit have long been used medicinally.\n\n\"I find it intriguing that the purported medical usage of the plant is being revived today but is instead extracted from the vegetative parts,\" Davis said in an email interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill celery juice hurt you?\n\n\"There's nothing in it that's going to hurt you,\" Levitsky said. Celery can have a slight diuretic effect, which may increase urination and reduce some bloat.\n\nNutritionists say patients should not discontinue seeing their doctor or treatment in favour of a celery juice regimen.\n\nBut there is something larger at stake, Levitsky said. Believing in miraculous remedies can leave patients vulnerable to just about anything, even harmful treatments. \"It thwarts belief in science and medicine to some magical mystery cure, and there ain't no such thing,\" he said.\n\nIs celery juice a scam?\n\n\"It's definitely not a 'miracle juice',\" said Rebecca Scritchfield, dietitian and author of Body Kindness. \"It can join the list of the snake oil remedies.\"\n\nWilliam, for his part, contends he is not misleading anyone; he neither owns a celery farm nor sells the juice himself. \"I'm not saying it's a cure-all,\" he said.\n\nNutritionists say to drink celery juice if it is enjoyable, but don't take stock in all the claims.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "If anecdotes are anything to go by, celery juice has helped with everything from acne to psoriasis.
