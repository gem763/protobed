Claure joined from SoftBank, which took control of WeWork in a multi-billion-dollar buyout this week. (Bloomberg)\n\nTalking point: This is a major shift for a firm that\u2019s become notorious for focusing on breakneck growth at the expense of the bottom line, and it comes at a crucial time for both SoftBank and WeWork. Including the rescue package, SoftBank has now put more than US$19 billion into WeWork. It\u2019s also trying to winconfidence in its second tech megafund, Vision Fund 2, which has struggled to attract major investors following the disappointing performance of some of the first Vision Fund big-name bets, including WeWork. Meanwhile, WeWork\u2019s failed IPO put the firm in such a severe cash crunch that it reportedly delayed laying off workers earlier this month because it couldn\u2019t afford their severance.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
