Carolina also killed a 4-on-3 power play in overtime after Jordan Staal was called for hooking Nicklas Backstrom.\n\nT.J. Oshie scored his second goal of the season for the Capitals, who were playing the second game of a back-to-back. Garnet Hathaway, who signed as a free agent in July, added his first goal for Washington. Braden Holtby made 25 saves.\n\nWashington came close to an overtime winner late on its man-advantage when a pass deflected off defender Joel Edmundson\u2019s left skate and hit the left post.\n\nInstead, it was Gardiner who ended the game a couple minutes later. He picked up the puck in his own end and skated down the left into a 2-on-1. As Backstrom defended the cross-ice pass, Gardiner rifled a shot that found its way between Holtby and the left post.\n\nHaula made it 2-1 with 17:24 to play on Carolina\u2019s third power play of the game, finding a spot just in front of Holtby\u2019s crease and redirecting Teuvo Teravainen\u2019s feed beneath his pads.\n\nSlavin evened the game just over seven minutes later, as the Hurricanes converted on a 4-on-2 break. From right to left, Warren Foegele found Jordan Martinook, who then picked out Slavin, who used his hand to help control a bouncing puck before squeezing a low shot past Holtby.\n\nNOTES: Saturday\u2019s game marked the last in a three-game suspension for \u201cinappropriate conduct\u201d for Capitals C Evgeny Kuznetsov.
