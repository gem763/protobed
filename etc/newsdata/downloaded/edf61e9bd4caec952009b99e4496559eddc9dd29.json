The move, ahead of high-level discussions between U.S. and Chinese officials on Thursday and Friday, dampened enthusiasm over prospects for a breakthrough in the long-running trade dispute, weighing on stock-index futures.\n\nEarly Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, particularly investments made by U.S. government pension funds.\n\n\u201cAs we continue through the week, sentiment towards the trade war will remain critical for the oil market, especially with WTI prices testing key technical support near $52/barrel,\u201d Richey told MarketWatch. \u201cBottom line, bad news on trade this week would likely see WTI breakdown through the summer lows and retest last December\u2019s lows in the low to mid $40/barrel range.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the oil market will get an update on weekly U.S. petroleum supplies from the Energy Information Administration. Trade group the American Petroleum Institute will issue its own figures late Tuesday.\n\nCrude stockpiles are expected post a rise of 2.4 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 4, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. The survey also showed expectations for supply declines of 1.2 million barrels for gasoline and 2.5 million barrels for distillates, which include heating oil.\n\nBack on Nymex, November gasoline RBX19, -0.05% fell 0.2% to $1.5663 a gallon, while November heating HOX19, -0.19% edged down by 0.2% to $1.8997 a gallon.\n\nNovember natural-gas futures NGX19, -0.83% fell 0.7% to $2.288 per million British thermal units.\n\nRead: EIA expects U.S. winter heating bills to be lower than last year\u2019s", "description": "Oil futures head lower Tuesday as traders keep tabs on developments ahead of U.S.-China trade talks this week.", "authors": ["Myra P.
