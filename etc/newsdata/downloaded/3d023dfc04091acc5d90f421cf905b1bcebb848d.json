This president, Donald Trump, doesn\u2019t drink. What he does do is eat hot dogs \u2014 and aboard Air Force One, he shared one with none other than talk radio icon Michael Savage.\n\nAs far as memories go, that\u2019s a pretty cool one.\n\n\u201cHere is a man who is conducting world affairs, here is a man who has the issue of Iran on his hands, North Korea, an election, fundraising, personal and family matters, and he has the dignity and respect for his supporters, like the listeners of The Savage Nation, because it\u2019s about the audience, it\u2019s not about me,\u201d Savage wrote, in an emailed statement.\n\nWhat a difference a summit makes. Remember the famous Barack Obama beer summit of 2009, when that president brought together black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and white police Sgt. James Crowley to heal racial divides?\n\nThis is how Time remembers it \u2014 Time, a magazine that\u2019s hardly a friend of conservatives: \u201cBeer Summit Gone Wrong,\u201d the headline blasted.\n\nThe piece went on to say how the \u201cbeer summit\u201d could have been a good thing for public relations, \u201cexcept for one thing: the media were invited.\u201d In other words, it had all the looks of a staged political stunt.\n\nThat\u2019s because it was a staged political stunt.\n\n\u201cThe three men (plus Joe Biden) sat around a strategically placed table, each drinking his favorite brew, as the press corps watched from across the White House lawn,\u201d Time wrote.\n\nWatched, and clicked their camera shutters, planning in their minds how best to create the most fawning media packages to showcase Obama as the friend of black man and white man, both. As a healer. As a peace-maker.\n\nA savior.\n\nGag. Humble is not a word that was generally slung Obama\u2019s way.\n\nBut this president \u2014 this President Trump: What a refreshing change.\n\n\u201cWhile sitting with President Trump on Air Force One, two hotdogs are delivered,\u201d Savage wrote. \u201cI\u2019m starving at this point. President Trump \u2026 says, \u2018You want one?\u2019 I said, \u2018Sure.\u2019 He takes one off his plate [and places it] delicately on another plate.\u201d\n\nHe recommends mustard, not \u201cthat ketchup with sugar on it\u201d \u2014 because apparently, \u201cthey know what I say on the radio\u201d about nutrition, Savage wrote.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump then dollops out the mustard for me from his plate, showing a certain humility and generosity that you may not be aware of from him,\u201d Savage went on.\n\nIt\u2019s the little things that reveal the biggest things.\n\n\u201cI doubt very much that Obama would have taken mustard from his plate and given it to anyone \u2014 or shared a hotdog with anyone,\u201d Savage wrote.\n\nExactly.\n\nOh, and in case you\u2019re wondering: Savage eats his hot dog in his hands, baseball game style. Trump? Trump eats his hotdog with a fork and knife.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
