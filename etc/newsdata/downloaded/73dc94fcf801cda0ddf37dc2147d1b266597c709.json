Here\u2019s What to Expect.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nThe biotech company Biogen has had a disastrous year, with the failure of an Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug slashing the stock\u2019s price by 26% in 2019. That\u2019s far worse than the broader S&P 500, which is up 19.3% over the same period, and the 6.1% gain of iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF, which tracks the sector.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Biogen (ticker: BIIB) will have a chance to try to win back investor confidence as it releases its third-quarter results. The company has scheduled an earnings call for 8 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nInvestors have been in a wait-and-see mode with the shares since its plummet in late March. The stock is up 3.2% since March 22, and has traded consistently between $220 and $240. Biogen is trading at 6.9 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, substantially below its five-year average of 13.3 times earnings.\n\nHere is a snapshot of investors\u2019 expectations and recent history.\n\n\u2022 Wall Street analysts expect Biogen to report quarterly earnings of $8.28 per share, and sales of $3.5 billion, according to FactSet.\n\n\u2022 Biogen\u2019s drug for spinal muscular atrophy, called Spinraza, is facing competition from Novartis\u2019s (NVS) gene therapy Zolgensma. Zolgensma went on the market earlier this year; data in Biogen and Novartis\u2019s quarterly reports this month should show how significantly Zolgensma is cutting into Spinraza sales.\n\n\u2022 In a note on Oct. 11, Bernstein\u2019s Ronny Gal wrote that Biogen was \u201cexceedingly cash generative,\u201d and that it has a neurology pipeline of first-in-kind therapies. \u201cThe challenge is that both the MS brands and Spinraza face risks of decline,\u201d Gal wrote. The debate centers on rate of these products erosion vs. the delivery coming from the pipeline.\u201d He rates the stock Market-perform.\n\n\u2022 Biogen is awaiting a decision by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board over a challenge to a key patent protecting Tecfidera, its multiple sclerosis drug. The challenge was brought by Mylan (MYL). A decision is expected early next year.\n\n\u2022 In a note on October 15, Nomura Instinet analyst Christopher Marai wrote that Spinraza sales seemed safe from Zolgensma, though could see a threat in the future from Risdiplam, a Roche (RHBBY) drug.\n\n\u2022 In July, Biogen significantly beat earnings expectations, reporting earnings of $9.15 per share, far better than the $7.53 Wall Street consensus forecast. Still, sales of Spinraza missed expectations.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "Wall Street analysts expect Biogen to report quarterly earnings of $8.28 per share, and sales of $3.5 billion, according to FactSet.", "authors": ["Josh Nathan-Kazis"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-118368/social", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
