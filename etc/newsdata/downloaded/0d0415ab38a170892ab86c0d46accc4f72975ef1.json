But it brought back sad memories of her father\u2019s sudden death almost three years ago.\n\nThe 22-year-old model shared an emotional Instagram story on Monday to share the concerning news about her beloved mum.\n\nWithout revealing specific details about Elizabeth\u2019s health, Jordyn explained that she spent the night by her mother\u2019s hospital bedside.\n\nIn a heartfelt message, Jordyn wrote: \u2018Last time one of my parents was in the hospital he ended up passing suddenly. Staying in the hospital with my mom tonight and I know she\u2019s going to be fine.\n\n\u2018God is just throwing me all of these obstacles just to prepare and make me stronger than ever.\u2019\n\nShe added optimistically: \u2018Please pray for a speedy recovery for @elizabeth woods\u2026 we need you healthy mommy [sic].\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth also confirmed her unfortunate hospital visit with photos of the drip in her hand, with the captions: \u2018Didn\u2019t think today I would be in the hospital.

My Daddy. Just two short weeks ago he was diagnosed with cancer and by that time it was too late. I appreciate everyone\u2019s kind words and it means the world to me.
