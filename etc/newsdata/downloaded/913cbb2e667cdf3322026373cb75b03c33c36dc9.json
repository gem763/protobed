This suggests conviction of Trump in the Republican-controlled Senate, should the House impeach him, isn\u2019t a door that\u2019s entirely slammed shut.\n\nDefending Trump has been a struggle since the whistleblower complaint and rough transcript of the Ukraine phone call came out a month ago. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) went on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and tried to refute the language Trump used when he responded to Ukraine\u2019s president inquiring about more aid. He incorrectly accused his interviewer of distorting Trump's now-famous line: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though\u201d to try to make it sound worse for Trump. CBS's Scott Pelley was quoting Trump accurately.\n\nNow, as the impeachment inquiry presents stronger evidence Trump was holding up military aid for his personal gain, his congressional defenders are pulling even more Trumpian tactics. Most of them collapse under the weight of the facts. Some are so obviously political stunts that there\u2019s no other way to describe them.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) speaks during a news conference alongside House Republicans on Capitol Hill. (Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)\n\nFor instance:\n\nOn Wednesday, about 30 Republicans very publicly stormed into the secure room in the Capitol\u2019s basement, demanding to be let into an inquiry that most of them didn\u2019t have a right to be a part of \u2014 even if the hearings were public. (They aren\u2019t on the corresponding committees handling impeachment.) They quickly realized that bringing hackable phones into a secure location was a major security breach that potentially compromised the investigation \u2014 and put an end to their ostensible plans to broadcast their sit-in publicly. The hearing with a Pentagon official who oversaw the Ukraine aid started up again after five hours of delay.\n\nTwo top Republican senators introduced a resolution yesterday condemning the whole House inquiry. That won\u2019t stop it, but it will help undermine it\u2014and show Trump whose side Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are on. Graham says the nonbinding resolution has 46 supporters, though several key Republicans have not signed on, including Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Cory Gardner (Colo.), who are both in tough reelection battles.\n\nIt followed a day of whispered concern among Senate Republicans that things are looking bad for Trump.\n\n\u201cThe picture coming out of it based on the reporting we\u2019ve seen is, yeah, I would say is not a good one,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) told NBC a day after acting ambassador Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony about potential quid pro quos. Thune is the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.\n\nAlso Wednesday, an editor at National Journal spoke to a source close to McConnell who said: \u201cThis is shaping up to be a very dark moment for the Trump White House.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaks during a news conference concerning the impeachment inquiry. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the House, Republicans continue pressing their quixotic argument that the impeachment inquiry isn\u2019t official until they vote on it. There\u2019s no rule that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has to do that. And even if she did, it wouldn\u2019t change the fact Democrats control the process.\n\nFinally, some Republicans sitting in the hearings insist they haven\u2019t seen evidence of a quid pro quo. But that misses the point: There doesn\u2019t have to be one for Trump to get impeached, and in a court of law it\u2019s really hard to prove an explicit, undeniable quid pro quo anyway, Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University in Los Angeles told me. So some Republicans are moving the goal posts on an impeachable offense to something that\u2019s impossible to fully prove.\n\n\u201cI mean \u2026 show me something that \u2026 is a crime,\u201d Graham said to Axios on HBO in an interview last week. \u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.\u201d\n\nRepublicans\u2019 erratic attempts to defend the president are derived from the fact the White House has no coherent defense either, and it largely isn\u2019t coordinating with Republicans on what to say or do.\n\nTrump had lunch with a small group of Republican senators backing Graham\u2019s resolution and complained bitterly that he was the victim of a never-ending political assault. \u201cHe feels like it never stops, that he\u2019s been in office for, what, three years now, and every time he turns around there\u2019s another reason that his family, his friends have to pay legal bills,\u201d Graham said, according to the Times. \u201cHe keeps telling us he did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nYet campaign consultants have stressed to senators the importance of maintaining their own credibility, two senior Republican officials told the Times: \u201cThey have instructed senators not to respond to every turn of the screw, one reason that most of them have dodged questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct or resorted to complaints about the process.\u201d\n\nAs Republicans are flapping in the wind, Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry remain focused and fortified that they are on the path to uncovering wrongdoing against the president. They could bring their evidence out in the open in public hearings in a few weeks, report The Post\u2019s Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian. It would saturate the public consciousness and polls continue to show a majority of Americans support the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAll this is to say: Are Republicans running out of options to defend Trump from a very real impeachment threat? It\u2019s a possibility to watch.\n\nAmber writes The 5-Minute Fix newsletter, a weekday afternoon rundown of the biggest political news that right now exclusively focuses on impeachment.\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nMORE ON THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:\n\n-- The White House delayed a Ukraine trade decision in August after then-national security adviser John Bolton warned Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that Trump would probably oppose any action that benefited Kyiv, a sign that U.S. suspension of cooperation to the country extended beyond security funds. David J. Lynch and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cThe August exchange between Bolton and Lighthizer over the trade matter represents the first indication that the administration\u2019s suspension of assistance to Ukraine extended beyond the congressionally authorized military aid and security assistance to other government programs. It is not clear whether Trump directed Bolton to intervene over Ukraine\u2019s trade privileges or was even aware of the discussion. \u2026 One former U.S. government official said the president wanted \u2018the total elimination\u2019 of the global trade program at issue. Known as the \u2018generalized system of preferences,\u2019 or GSP, it allows 120 countries to ship roughly 1.5 percent of total U.S. imports without paying tariffs. But in March 2018, Trump signed legislation reauthorizing the program through 2020, and Lighthizer in recent weeks has been negotiating with India over restoring its GSP status, which was suspended in March.\u201d\n\n-- Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cBarr tapped Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham in May to review the FBI\u2019s investigation, looking specifically at whether the U.S. government\u2019s \u2018intelligence collection activities\u2019 in the probe of possible coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia were \u2018lawful and appropriate,\u2019 a person familiar with the matter said then. Durham\u2019s appointment came amid calls from Trump and his allies to investigate the FBI personnel and those in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s office involved with the probe of Trump\u2019s campaign. At the time, the Justice Department inspector general was conducting a similar probe. The significance of officials deeming Durham\u2019s probe \u2018criminal\u2019 is difficult to determine by itself. Durham\u2019s appointment was noteworthy because he, unlike the inspector general, is a federal prosecutor with the ability to convene a grand jury that could compel witnesses to testify or charge people with crimes if Durham felt that was necessary.\u201d\n\n-- Democrats say the first whistleblower\u2019s testimony is no longer necessary as other witnesses have come forward. Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report: \u201cDemocrats were once prepared to take extraordinary steps to preserve the whistleblower\u2019s identity under questioning, considering him central to their investigation. But over the past month, they have grown cold to the idea of exposing him to additional scrutiny after several witnesses described how Trump leveraged access and military aid to secure a promise from Ukraine to launch investigations that could help his 2020 reelection bid. \u2018I think it\u2019s quite clear we have a surfeit of evidence that corroborates in full every aspect of what happened and the policy they were pursuing,\u2019 said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), a member of the Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees.\u201d\n\n\u00ad-- The Trump administration sent a letter to Pentagon official Laura Cooper warning her not to testify before House impeachment investigators. She did so anyway. \"The letter, signed by deputy secretary of defense David Norquist, leaves ambiguous whether the actions of Cooper and other State Department employees who\u2019ve testified would be considered insubordinate. So far, though, none of the witnesses who are current federal employees have been fired.\" (New York Times)\n\nTwo young mothers from Honduras and their children are detained by U.S. Border Patrol in Granjeno, Tex., after rafting across the Rio Grande in June 2018. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- The ACLU said 1,500 more migrant children were taken away from their parents by the Trump administration. Maria Sacchetti reports: \u201cThe majority of the children are ages 12 and under, including more than 200 considered \u2018tender age\u2019 because they are under 5 years old. The ACLU said the Justice Department disclosed the final tally \u2014 which is in addition to the more than 2,700 children known to have been separated last year \u2014 hours before a federal court deadline to identify all children separated since mid-2017, the year President Trump took office. U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego gave the Trump administration six months in April to disclose the names to the ACLU, which is trying to track down all the families and learn whether they have been reunited. \u2026 ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said the Justice Department has been sending the names of separated families to them in batches and provided the last information Thursday. He said he is worried that parents have been deported without their children.\u201d\n\n\u00ad-- The Trump administration is testing a secretive program that aims to speed up the asylum process for migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border. From Robert Moore: \u201cThe pilot program \u2014 known as Prompt Asylum Claim Review \u2014 streamlines the asylum process so that migrants who are seeking safe refuge in the United States will receive a decision in 10 days or less, rather than the months or years it currently takes, according to Customs and Border Protection officials. The reviews are largely to determine if Central American migrants can be sent back to their homelands ... El Paso is the only place where the administration is currently testing the program, which started this month, according to U.S. officials.\u201d\n\n-- A federal judge is holding Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in contempt for violating an order to stop collecting loan payments from former Corinthian Colleges students. Danielle Douglas-Gabriel reports: \u201cMagistrate Judge Sallie Kim of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco slapped the Education Department with a $100,000 fine for violating a preliminary injunction. Money from the fine will be used to compensate the 16,000 people harmed by the federal agency\u2019s actions. Some former students of the defunct for-profit college had their paychecks garnished. Others had their tax refunds seized by the federal government. \u2026 The judge has ordered the department to provide monthly status reports on its efforts to follow her order and rectify the harm it inflicted upon borrowers. Failure to comply with this latest order could result in additional sanctions. The Education Department said it was disappointed in the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d\n\n-- Arthur Wayne Johnson, appointed by DeVos to a top post in the government\u2019s trillion-dollar financial aid operations, resigned, saying the student loan system is \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d and called for the elimination of millions in student debt. From Douglas-Gabriel: \u201cThe departure of Johnson, who said he will seek a Senate seat in Georgia, arrives as House Democrats ramp up their investigation of the role Education Department officials, including Johnson, played in helping Dream Center Education Holdings. Dream Center operated the defunct for-profit chain Argosy University and the Art Institutes. The House Education and Labor Committee has requested an interview with Johnson, DeVos and the department\u2019s head of higher education policy, Diane Auer Jones.\u201d\n\n-- A number of conservative activists voiced their support for the embattled acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, telling Trump that the \u201cswamp\u201d is attacking him and urging him to permanently appoint the former House conservative to the job. From the Times: \u201cThe letter was signed by dozens of conservatives, including Ginni Thomas, who is married to the Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council and David McIntosh, the president of the anti-tax Club for Growth. \u2026 The letter continued, \u2018Recent news reports demonstrate that the D.C. swamp is attacking him \u2014 and we believe it is because he has been the most successful chief of staff in this administration to advance the Trump pro-America agenda.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump directed federal agencies not to renew their subscriptions to The Post and the New York Times, per the Wall Street Journal: \u201c\u2018Not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving\u2014hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved,\u2019 White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in an email Thursday. Ms. Grisham declined to provide further details, and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the White House intended to compel agencies to cancel the subscriptions or how soon the order would take effect. The White House was still working on implementing the directive as of Thursday morning, an administration official said. \u2026 Mr. Trump is an avid consumer of the news, and he regularly reads the Times and the Post, according to aides who privately acknowledged that they expect him to continue doing so despite the directive. \u2026 Federal employees are eligible for free digital subscriptions to the Post using their government email addresses.\u201d\n\n-- Trump said he will attend Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park this Sunday if the Nats and the Astros are still playing. David Nakamura reports: \u201cTrump\u2019s attendance at the 41,000-seat stadium in Southeast would mark a rare time he has ventured into the District\u2019s entertainment and nightlife scene, other than his occasional visits to the Trump hotel a few blocks from the White House. It could also mean increased security restrictions at the ballpark for what is expected to be a capacity crowd.\u201d\n\n-- The House Transportation Committee issued a subpoena for financial records and other information related to Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel, which is housed in a federally owned building. Jonathan O\u2019Connell reports: \u201cAccording to a copy of the subpoena, sent by committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) to [General Services] Administrator Emily Murphy, the committee is seeking any communications between the GSA and Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump or Eric Trump, as well as monthly financial records that the Trump Organization provides to the agency. \u2026 The Transportation Committee\u2019s subpoena also seeks legal memos regarding the [GSA\u2019s] decision to allow the lease to remain in place despite a passage in it barring elected officials from benefiting from it and the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which bars the president from accepting gifts or payments from foreign or domestic governments.\u201d\n\n-- New Jersey is trying to revoke the liquor license for Trump\u2019s golf course in Colts Neck, N.J., triggered by a 2015 case in which state officials say the Trump club overserved alcohol to a man who then caused a fatal wreck, David A. Fahrenthold reports. The state is giving Trump\u2019s company 30 days to challenge the planned revocation.\n\nTHE 2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Economists are rushing to help Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) figure out her Medicare-for-all tax puzzle. Jeff Stein reports: \u201cWarren has promised more details within weeks, but her team faces a challenge in crafting a plan that would bring in large amounts of revenue while not scaring off voters with big middle-class tax increases. \u2026 Bharat Ramamurti, a longtime Warren aide who served on the Senate Banking Committee, is widely seen as spearheading the single-payer financing plan for the campaign, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning. \u2018They want to figure out \u2014 with one go \u2014 how to stop the \u2018How are you going to pay for it?\u2019 question,\u2019 one outside economic adviser said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the campaign\u2019s thinking. \u2018She wants something airtight but easy to understand.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), a freshman who has gained notice for her grilling of corporate executives in congressional hearings, plans to endorse Warren for president, per CNN.\n\n-- Former vice president Joe Biden appeared to drop his opposition to the creation of a super PAC to benefit his campaign. Matt Viser reports: \u201cKate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, released a statement Thursday afternoon saying that Biden will reform campaign finance if he is president, but in the meantime, he will open the door to outside money. \u2026 The decision is also bound to trigger accusations of \u00adflip-flopping, given that Biden has long said he would reject such outside help. His campaign advisers were aggressively opposed to the idea as recently as three weeks ago, pushing back against a Washington Post report stating that the campaign \u2018has publicly discouraged\u2019 outside help because they felt it was not worded strongly enough.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released a marijuana legalization plan to expunge criminal convictions related to the drug. Sean Sullivan reports: \u201cSanders\u2019s plan, which aims to overhaul an approach he argues has unfairly hurt minorities, calls for using executive power to reclassify marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance and passing legislation to permanently legalize the drug. \u2026 The marijuana industry, however, has become lucrative as more states have legalized it. Sanders, who is running on a platform of curtailing income inequality and reining in the power of big companies, says he would create provisions to prevent large corporations from dominating the market.\u201d\n\n-- And then there were 17: Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) quit the presidential race and said he will run for reelection to the House. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cRyan (D-Ohio), who pitched himself as the candidate best poised to talk to working-class people and take back Rust Belt states from President Trump, failed to qualify for the third and fourth Democratic debates. He has a Dec. 11 deadline to file to run for reelection in his Ohio district.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) said she won\u2019t run for reelection as she continues her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Tim Elfrink reports: \u201cGabbard faced a Democratic primary challenge from Hawaii state Sen. Kai Kahele, who has lashed out at her for missing votes while on the presidential campaign trail. Gabbard cited her presidential bid in her decision not to seek another term. \u2026 Hours before announcing that she would not seek another term in Congress, Gabbard appeared on Fox News host Sean Hannity\u2019s show Thursday night to criticize Democrats for holding impeachment hearings in private.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump campaign owes over $1 million in outstanding bills to cities. Philip Bump reports: The money concerns costs around political rallies held around the country. \"The campaign generally doesn\u2019t sign contracts for additional police officers, so the cities don\u2019t have binding agreements to recoup the costs. \u2026 In the context of Trump\u2019s campaign, these costs are not significant. Earlier this week, the Republican Party celebrated having raised more than $300 million through the first three quarters of 2019. Reimbursing these cities for the costs they incurred from Trump\u2019s rallies, then, would eat up a little more than a day\u2019s average fundraising. Don\u2019t expect that to happen.\u201d\n\n-- One of Trump\u2019s Republican challengers, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, said he would vote for Biden \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d against Trump in the general election. From the AP: \u201cWeld says he\u2019d never support Trump \u2018for any office under any circumstances\u2019 but could \u2018very well\u2019 support a third-party candidate. If the matchup were Trump against [Warren], Weld says, \u2018I suppose I\u2019d rather have her, with a couple of modifications in her platform.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited a workforce development program in Kansas, refueling speculation that he may leave the administration to run for Senate next year. Annie Gowen and Carol Morello report: \u201cEarlier in the day, a Wichita Eagle reporter asked if touring a technical school was the best use of time for America\u2019s chief diplomat. Pompeo said \u2018absolutely, 100 percent,\u2019 adding that he also wanted to attend the wedding of his son\u2019s best friend. \u2026 He said Thursday that there had been \u2018no change\u2019 in his thinking [about running for Senate]. His \u2018mission\u2019 is \u2018to \u00adexecute American diplomacy, to make sure that American markets are open for Kansas products all around the world,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. And it\u2019s what I continue, intend to continue to be focused on.\u2019\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nWhite House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway lashed out at a Washington Examiner reporter who, in a story about Conway\u2019s potential shot at becoming White House chief of staff, mentioned the ongoing rift between Trump and Conway\u2019s husband, conservative lawyer George Conway:\n\nThey way Kellyanne Conway talks to a Washington Examiner reporter here is....wow, something elsepic.twitter.com/GWDuXfi0fu \u2014 jordan (@JordanUhl) October 24, 2019\n\nCommentators on both sides reacted:\n\nLook: Being yelled at sometimes is part of journalism.
