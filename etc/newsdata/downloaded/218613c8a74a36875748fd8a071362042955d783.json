Giuliani sought to manipulate the Ukrainian government into helping Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. Lawmakers have demanded a full transcript and a list of participants on the call.\n\n\n\nA White House spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 investigation was launched earlier this month, before revelations that an intelligence official had lodged a complaint with the inspector general. The Washington Post first reported on Wednesday that the complaint had to do with a \u201cpromise\u201d that Trump made when communicating with a foreign leader.\n\nOn Thursday, the inspector general testified behind closed doors to members of the House Intelligence Committee about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nOver the course of three hours, Michael Atkinson repeatedly declined to discuss with members the content of the complaint, saying he was not authorized to do so.\n\nHe and the members spent much of their time discussing the process Atkinson followed, the statute governing his investigation of the complaint and the nature of an \u201curgent concern\u201d that he believed it represented, according to a person familiar with the briefing, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cHe was being excruciatingly careful about the language he used,\u201d the person said.\n\nAtkinson made clear that he disagreed with a lawyer for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who had contradicted the inspector general and found that the whistleblower complaint did not meet the statutory definition of an urgent concern because it involved a matter not under the DNI\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nAtkinson told lawmakers that he disagreed with that analysis \u2014 meaning he felt the matter was under the DNI\u2019s purview \u2014 and also that it was urgent \u201cin the common understanding of the word,\u201d the person said.\n\nAtkinson told the committee that the complaint did not stem from just one conversation, according to two people familiar with his testimony.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the committee, warned of legal action if intelligence officials did not share the whistleblower complaint.\n\nSchiff described acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire\u2019s refusal to share the complaint with Congress as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said he understood the Justice Department was involved in that decision.\n\n\u201cWe cannot get an answer to the question about whether the White House is also involved in preventing this information from coming to Congress,\u201d Schiff said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is to make sure that the national security is protected.\u201d\n\nSomeone, Schiff said, \u201cis trying to manipulate the system to keep information about an urgent matter from the Congress \u2026 There certainly are a lot of indications that it was someone at a higher pay grade than the director of national intelligence.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Evan Vucci/AP President Trump talks with reporters as he tours a section of the southern border wall on Wednesday in Otay Mesa, Calif.\n\nTrump has denied doing anything improper. In a tweet Thursday morning, the president wrote, \u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself.\n\n\u201cKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nIn a Sept. 17 letter to intelligence committee leaders, Atkinson wrote that he and Maguire \u201care at an impasse\u201d over how the whistleblower could contact the congressional committees. Ordinarily, a matter of urgent concern that the inspector general deems credible is supposed to be forwarded to the intelligence oversight panels in the House and Senate.\n\nBut Maguire prevented Atkinson from doing so, according to correspondence that has been made public. Atkinson wrote that he had requested permission from Maguire to inform the congressional intelligence committees about the general subject matter of the complaint, but was denied.\n\nMaguire, Atkinson wrote, had consulted with the Justice Department, which determined that the law didn\u2019t require disclosing the complaint to the committee because it didn\u2019t involve a member of the intelligence community or \u201can intelligence activity under the DNI\u2019s supervision.\u201d\n\nAtkinson faulted the Justice Department\u2019s conclusion \u201cparticularly \u2026 and the Acting DNI\u2019s apparent agreement with the conclusion, that the disclosure in this case does not concern an intelligence activity within the DNI\u2019s authority.\u201d\n\nMaguire is scheduled to testify before the Intelligence Committee in a public session next Thursday.\n\nIn letters to the White House and State Department, top Democrats earlier this month demanded records related to what they say are Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts \u201cto coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity\u201d \u2014 one to help Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is in prison for illegal lobbying and financial fraud, and a second to target the son of former vice president Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump.\n\n\u201cAs the 2020 election draws closer, President Trump and his personal attorney appear to have increased pressure on the Ukrainian government and its justice system in service of President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, and the White House and the State Department may be abetting this scheme,\u201d the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees wrote, citing media reports that Trump had threatened to withhold $250 million in aid to help Ukraine in its ongoing struggle against Russian-backed separatists.\n\nLawmakers also became aware in August that the Trump administration may be trying to stop the aid from reaching Ukraine, according to a congressional official.\n\nGiuliani dismissed the reports of the whistle blower and Trump\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even aware of the fact that he had such a phone call,\u201d Giuliani said Thursday. \u201cIf I\u2019m not worried about it, he\u2019s not worried about it.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure that government outside of formal diplomatic channels to effectively help the Trump reelection effort by investigating Hunter Biden about his time on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nThe filing of the whistleblower complaint has led to what veterans of U.S. spy agencies described as an unprecedented situation with potentially grave consequences for the already troubled relationship between the president and the nation\u2019s powerful intelligence community.\n\nIt remains unclear how the whistleblower gained access to details of the president\u2019s calls \u2014 whether through \u201creadouts\u201d generated by White House aides or through other means.\n\nMemos that serve as transcripts of such calls are created routinely. But if that is the source in this instance, it would appear to mean that White House aides made a formal record of comments by the president later deemed deeply troubling by the intelligence community\u2019s chief watchdog.\n\nellen.nakashima@washpost.com\n\nshane.harris@washpost.com\n\ngreg.miller@washpost.com\n\ncarol.leonnig@washpost.com\n\nJohn Wagner, Karoun Demirjian, Robert Costa and Josh Dawsey contributed reporting.", "description": "Democratic lawmakers are demanding to see the complaint made by an intelligence official who formerly worked in the White House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHydTa.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f"}
