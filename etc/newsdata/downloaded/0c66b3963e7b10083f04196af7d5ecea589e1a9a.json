'\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook sparked the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, with a two-week operation to fly 150,000 passengers back to the UK led by the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nThe comments came as MPs were told by the Insolvency Service that Hays Travel paid just over \u00a36 million to buy the 555 Thomas Cook shops \u2013 working out at only \u00a310,800 for each site.\n\nChair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee Rachel Reeves said the travel companies bosses ' keep blaming everything and everyone except themselves for its collapse - it\u2019s just excuse after excuse'\n\nPictured: A \u00a32million Spanish villa in Javea where Manny Fontenla-Novoa relaxed this summer\n\nThe BEIS committee heard last week from Peter Fankhauser \u2013 who was chief executive of Thomas Cook at the time of its collapse \u2013 that Mr Fontenla-Novoa's deal to buy MyTravel in 2007 was the root cause of the debts and following woes at the group.\n\nMr Fontenla-Novoa said he was 'incredibly sad' that Thomas Cook had gone bust, but denied it was his slew of deals and the burden of debt that ultimately led to its failure.\n\nMs Reeves said Mr Fankhauser believed the debt levels at Thomas Cook had 'made his job impossible'.\n\nBut Mr Fontenla-Novoa said: 'I can't accept that.\n\n'If Peter felt that, maybe they should have done something about that debt.'\n\nHe said that Mr Fankhauser should have ramped up disposals of assets earlier if the company believed it was unable to service that debt.\n\nA former Thomas Cook boss has denied saddling the firm with a debt mountain after a mammoth expansion drive (stock image)\n\nBut Mr Fontenla-Novoa, who now runs his own consultancy firm, admitted mistakes were made.\n\nHe said: 'Do I have regrets? Yes. If I could turn the clock back, would I do things differently? I would do lots of things differently.\n\n'I'm sorry at the way it's turned out.'\n\nHe defended the MyTravel deal and the merger of Thomas Cook with Co-op Travel in 2010 during his tenure, despite the weight of debts and questions over building a huge retail chain amid a shift towards online bookings.\n\nThe value of MyTravel was later subject to a mammoth \u00a31.1 billion writedown, though Mr Fontenla-Novoa pocketed a \u00a35 million bonus after the deal.\n\nHe insisted that 'even today, high-street travel agents have a really important role to play in the travel industry'.\n\nMs Green \u2013 who now runs business across Asia Pacific for computer giant IBM \u2013 said she also failed to move quickly enough to turn around the company.\n\nShe said it was 'devastating' that Thomas Cook eventually collapsed.\n\nIt also emerged earlier in the hearing that \u00a311 million has already been paid out in fees to the two firms employed by the liquidators of Thomas Cook.\n\nDean Beale, chief executive of the Insolvency Service, told MPs that KPMG and AlixPartners racked up the fees for the first three weeks alone after Thomas Cook's demise.\n\nHe said there were as many as 300 people at the two firms working on the liquidation at one stage immediately after the firm's collapse.", "description": "Manny Fontenla-Novoa said he thought debt at the firm was `manageable\u00b4 during his tenure.
