It doesn\u2019t create waste or air pollution,\u201d said Dr. Laura Teisch, a pediatrician from Las Vegas.\n\nFormula produces significant waste during its production, distribution and use. \u201cAs with all products, infant formula has an environmental footprint,\u201d says Andrea Riepe, a representative for Reckitt Benckiser Group which has infant formula Enfamil in its product portfolio. The company works to minimize the waste associated with Enfamil, she added.\n\nIt's known that breastfeeding protects both women and children. However, recent studies have highlighted that breastfeeding is also good for the Earth. Supporting mothers to breastfeed more would reduce the same amount of carbon emissions as removing nearly 77,500 cars from the UK's roads each year, asserts the editorial's authors.\n\nOver 80% of U.S. children are breastfed at some point but only about 25% are exclusively breastfed until age 6 months, according to the latest National Immunization Survey by the CDC.\n\nWhy should a woman breastfeed?\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics supports breastfeeding given its benefits to the child. It also helps prevent infection, diabetes, cancer and childhood obesity.\n\n\u201cDecreasing the risk for obesity is really important. Obesity is a risk factor for cancers such as breast, uterine, kidney and pancreatic,\u201d said Dr. Vivek N. Patel, a radiation oncologist from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nThere are benefits to the mother as well including decreased bleeding after delivery and a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers, the AAP also notes.\n\n\u201cBreast cancer is linked to exposure to estrogen,\u201d said Patel. \u201cWhen a woman breastfeeds, their menstrual cycle is delayed and therefore less estrogen is released.\u201d\n\nWhy do some parents choose formula?\n\n\u201cSometimes breastfeeding is contraindicated due to a medical condition,\u201d said Teisch. For example, \u201cBreastfeeding during cancer treatment isn\u2019t recommended as the treatment can affect your milk supply and harm the baby. If treatment is completed, a woman may breastfeed but the quantity and quality of breast milk may be affected,\u201d said Patel.\n\nBreastfeeding is also contraindicated when mothers have HIV and when infants have certain metabolic disorders.\n\nSome may prefer formula for the convenience.\n\nFormula may also supplement breast milk. Breastfed babies with significant weight loss who also received supplemental formula, had a reduced risk of hospitalization, a recent study in the American Journal of Pediatrics revealed.\n\nBreastfeeding isn\u2019t always an option.\n\n\"Women who try to breastfeed but are unable to do so are commonly left with 'mom guilt.' On top of those internal struggles, these mothers are often 'formula-shamed' by family, friends and even medical professionals. Parenting is hard, breastfeeding is hard and life itself can be hard,\" said Teisch.\n\nThe push for \"breast is best\" feeding often adds pressure on women, agreed Shenker.\n\n\"I know the struggle women face when they aren\u2019t able to breastfeed firsthand. I, too, had to rely on formula after the birth of my son. He had an extended stay in the NICU and despite my best efforts and support from family and medical professionals, I wasn\u2019t able to produce enough milk,\" Teisch shared.\n\n\"I don\u2019t formula-shame in my own practice. I encourage breastfeeding to the mothers of my patients and inform these mothers of the benefits associated with breastfeeding, but I also recognize and acknowledge to all my families that a healthy, growing and thriving baby with a happy mother is just as important too. Bottom line, fed is best,\" said Teisch.\n\nWhat can we do to support breastfeeding, when possible?\n\nThere are multiple ways to support breastfeeding mothers, Shenker said. She believes that healthcare providers should be better educated on how to support mothers when they want to breastfeed. Parents should develop a birth plan and a feeding plan, she also advised.\n\nBetter access to milk banks for children who need supplementation would also help, said Shenker. In fact, Shenker founded the Human Milk Foundation which works to create awareness about, supply and raise funding for donor milk. Shenker hopes her research will shed light on the environmental impact of formula to encourage the government to step up efforts that support breastfeeding.\n\nWhy is this important now?\n\nBreast health is always important but it\u2019s even more in focus currently as October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n\u201cBreast cancer awareness is crucial. There have been so many advances in our ability to detect and treat breast cancer in the past decade. As with any medical diagnosis, knowledge is power.\u201d says Patel.", "description": "Breastfeeding is not only good for mothers and their babies, but it also protects the environment according to an editorial in the British Medical Journal.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
