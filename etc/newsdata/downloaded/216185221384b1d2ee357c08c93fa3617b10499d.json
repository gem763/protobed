Isaac will also executive produce the show.\n\nhi im really excited for this@briankoppelman and @DavidLevien are singular talents and i can\u2019t believe i get to work with them and @Showtime to make SUPER PUMPED a show! pic.twitter.com/I9sjaBWnBK \u2014 rat king (@MikeIsaac) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cThe story of Uber is rich in plot twists, one-of-a-kind personalities and important implications for corporate America,\u201d Showtime Entertainment president Jana Winograde said in a statement. \u201cIt is a case study of ingenuity and insanity.\u201d\n\nAs The Verge points out, this is not the only Uber project being developed. Lionsgate\u2019s Good Universe is working on a film based on the blog post written by former Uber engineer Susa Fowler, in which she exposed sexual harassment and discrimination within the company.\n\nSo rest assured, whatever happens in the herky-jerky machinery of the Hollywood development process, Travis Kalanick will have his own fictionalised avatar that the public takes as a true representation of the man himself for the rest of his life. Maybe Travis and Zuck can finally bond over their shared fate.\n\nUber did not respond to a Gizmodo request for comment on the potential TV show about all the ways the company has fucked up.", "description": "The team behind Billions is developing a show about the rough-and-tumble rise of Uber, based on the bestselling book Super Pumped....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/tov1ppzmpovv2ysizns0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
