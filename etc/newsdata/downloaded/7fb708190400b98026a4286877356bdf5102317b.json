He will start the season with the Hustle but will do so under his current contract, as a 15-man-roster player for the Grizzlies. \u2014 Chris Herrington (@HerringtonNBA) September 27, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Suns are not exactly the best player developmental team in the NBA, and they quickly gave the athletic wing far more playmaking responsibility than he was ready for. The results were flashes of impressive play surrounded by lousy shot selection and just flat out missed shots. And that was just on the court, off the court Jackson\u2019s short career has been marred by legal issues, off-court problems, and frustration.\n\nThe Grizzlies are giving him a chance (and Jackson gets his paydays), but he\u2019s going to have to earn his way back to the NBA.", "description": "Just two years ago, Josh Jackson was the No. 4 pick of the Phoenix Suns.
