Since this moisturizer is also available to buy here, we are publishing it for our readers on this side of the pond.\n\nWhen I moved to Helsinki from London last year, I was wildly unprepared for just how cold -13\u00b0F feels. There are so many annoying things that happen in really cold weather (phones just \u2026 don\u2019t work?), but one of the worst side effects was that, almost overnight, my skin became extremely dry and patchy. I\u2019ve never really had problematic skin \u2014 if anything, it\u2019s more prone to being oily than dry \u2014 so I had no idea what I was supposed to do.\n\nAll the Finnish people I talked to told me that the worst thing you can do in cold weather is to use a moisturizer with an oil or gel base, which is what I had been doing (I was using Clinique\u2019s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel). Face oils don\u2019t hydrate the skin, so you need a cream-based moisturizer instead. Luckily I didn\u2019t need to look for long because everyone recommended the exact same product: Lumene\u2019s Sisu Moisture Remedy.\n\nLumene is the Finnish skin-care brand: Most Finnish women will have at least one Lumene product in their makeup bags. They\u2019ve been around since the \u201970s, and their products are on sale in every Finnish supermarket. It\u2019s basically the Finnish equivalent of Simple, or No.7. At $21 per 50ml tub, Lumene\u2019s face cream is a mid-range Finnish skin-care product: more expensive that Apo Base ($6 for 100ml) and cheaper than Heuna Organics ($170 for 30ml). Considering winters reach -40\u00b0F in the north of Finland, it makes sense that Lumene has developed a really good winter moisturizer.\n\nWithin a few days of starting to use it, the dry patches on my face had begun to disappear, and within a week they\u2019d gone. Even though it\u2019s a cream-based moisturizer, I didn\u2019t find it too greasy and I was able to apply both SPF underneath it and makeup on top of it. Regarding the scent: I\u2019m not a huge fan of overly fragrant moisturizers, so the fact that this one is only mildly scented with natural pine and spruce appealed to me.\n\nOn particularly cold and windy days, following the advice of my Finnish friends, I got into the habit of applying a pea-size blob to my face half an hour before leaving the house for extra protection. A small blob of this face cream goes a long way, so one tub should easily see you through an entire winter. Few places feel as frigid as Helsinki, but when February hits, and the bitter cold settles in, this cream will easily keep your skin protected.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
