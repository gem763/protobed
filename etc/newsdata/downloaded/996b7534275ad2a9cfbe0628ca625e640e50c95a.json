No spending splurge can repair it | Polly Toynbee", "language": "en", "text": "Look at the people here in Manchester at the Tory party conference, stare into their eyes and they look much as they always did \u2013 ordinary home counties folk, small business people, plus a few sharp-suited would-be spads. Not noticeably odd, yet these party members are the tiny group who have done for their country.\n\nOver the past decade, their Brexit fever has packed the Commons with Europhobes. These respectable law and order-minded patriots chose a dishonest, disreputable, disgrace of a man for prime minister, who will trash their constitution, mislead their monarch, and disrespect their judges to use \u201cany means necessary\u201d to get anything he wants. These ordinary people have turned into wreckers of what they used to hold dearest.\n\nMore hyperbole than hard cash, many announcements crumble under scrutiny \u2013 not 40 new hospitals but refurbishment for six\n\nObservers ask if this party is falling apart in front of our eyes: expelling its MPs, pursuing a no-deal Brexit whose catastrophic effects would render the party unelectable for ever. If they only knew it, the Benn Act \u2013 preventing a no-deal crashout at the end of next month \u2013 saves them from themselves. Some of the 21 banished will not be kept away: Alistair Burt, Dominic Grieve and David Gauke brave the hissing. Any moderates here stay quiet, expect for one businessman tapping me on the shoulder, despairing at what no deal would do to his company. He handed me a paper. I was amazed to find a timeline of the rise of the Nazis. \u201cThat\u2019s how Hitler did it, used the constitution step by step,\u201d he murmured. Even the moderates are extreme.\n\nNothing augurs well for Boris Johnson \u2013 his bounce declining, caught in a pincer between Nigel Farage and an electorate that has for two years now swung away from Brexit. Long-term demographics may sink the party, with no decent victory since 1987. The flight of the young was spelled out brutally by David Willetts, chair of the Resolution Foundation. He found that only 8% of women under 35 would vote Tory. The age at which people vote Tory is rising fast \u2013 over 49s in 2017, now only a majority of those over 51. Age has outstripped class in determining voting habits. \u201cHow to win back younger voters?\u201d they were asking. You can\u2019t, was the conclusion. Because those in their 20s are worse off than their parents, not home owners, spending a third of their income on rents, stuck in insecure gig jobs, young parents crippled by childcare costs. Socially liberal, 20% ethnically diverse, deeply concerned about the climate crisis, they are ignored here. They are remainers and they will not be coming back. Best news for the Tories is the Electoral Reform Society reporting that 9.4 million are missing from the electoral register, mostly the young and renters: David Cameron stopped households and colleges registering them automatically, knowing the young are the enemy. Sorrowfully, the chair of Cameron\u2019s former Witney Young Conservatives rose to say he had only four members.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A homeless man on the streets of Manchester, January 2017.

More hyperbole than hard cash, many announcements crumble under scrutiny \u2013 not 40 new hospitals but refurbishment for six. \u201cA relatively gradual increase in spending,\u201d said the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Welcome, yes, but Sajid Javid\u2019s offer of \u201ca decade of renewal\u201d will be greeted with wry disbelief, too late to change public perceptions when voters see the threadbare services around them.\n\nNon-stop repetition of \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism only reminds people how deeply this party has riven the country. Matching Labour\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d was an eye-catching political necessity. But the chancellor\u2019s \u201cBrexit red tape challenge\u201d against \u201coverbearing bureaucracy\u201d will sound a klaxon about plans for a post-Brexit removal of protections for workers, food, finance and consumer safety. Everything else is forgotten, the \u00a337bn taken out of benefits gone for ever, as universal credit keeps tipping more families into penury; with child poverty approaching 40%, unmatched since the war.\n\nTaking a breather from the fetid airlessness of this conference where all intellectual oxygen has been sucked out by \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, I found Coffee4Craig, a small haven for the homeless, open two hours an evening for food, clothes and advice. Risha Lancaster opened it when her brother died on the streets from a heroin overdose. Among the old-timers, such as the woman in the wheelchair who comes for supper every night, she is alarmed to find so many more newcomers: she tries to divert them towards early help. \u201cThey get beaten up, everything stolen, especially shoes and ID. Everything spirals out of control.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s unwinnable chess match is nearing its endgame | Anand Menon and Alan Wager Read more\n\nThe five-week wait for universal credit, along with benefits sanctions, tips many on to the street. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to send them for mental health, so many addiction services shut down. There\u2019s no beds.\u201d Several have stumbled in to die here, turned out by hospitals. Here is the 54-year-old woman in a flowery blouse thrown out by her landlord, and a live-in chef sacked with no benefits for rent. \u201cNot the council\u2019s fault, after all the cuts to their funds. They do all they can.\u201d\n\nThe end of austerity will be a long time arriving here, if ever. Rough sleepers are only the most visible sign of the disintegration of all key services \u2013 from housing to A&E waiting times, and benefit levels that no longer keep working families\u2019 heads above poverty. None of this is anywhere on Johnson\u2019s one nation horizon.\n\nHe may think spaffing some last-minute cash has shot Labour\u2019s fox. I doubt many voters will think austerity is over until there are no homeless in their supermarket doorways, until they can get a GP appointment, schools stop begging for pens, and the government takes the climate emergency seriously \u2013 virtually unmentioned here. Brexit stirs strong passions, but come an election the state of the nation counts for more \u2013 and the Tories will have no cover for their abysmal decade of strife and decay.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Sajid Javid\u2019s speech was more hyperbole than hard cash.
