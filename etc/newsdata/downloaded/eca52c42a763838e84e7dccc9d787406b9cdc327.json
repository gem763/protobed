The bad news: Concussion rates increased in football games.\n\n\"These results matter for all stakeholders involved in high school sports: parents, coaches, athletes, as well as researchers,\" said Avinash Chandran, a post-doctoral research associate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who was an author of the study.\n\n\"This study updates our understanding of concussion patterns in high school sports using injury surveillance data,\" he said. \"It adds to our existing understanding by providing the most recent 'time-stamp' in concussion incidence in high school sports.\"\n\nThe study found trends in concussion rates not only for football but also more than a dozen other sports, including soccer, ice hockey and cheerleading -- which were among the sports with the most concussion incidence.\n\nThe study also found that among all sports, there was only one in which the concussion rate was higher during practice than in competition.\n\nThe high school sports with high concussion rates\n\nThe study included data on 9,542 concussions across 20 high school sports that occurred between the 2013-2014 and 2017-2018 school years.\n\nJUST WATCHED How to recognize a concussion Replay More Videos ...

Girls' soccer, with 8.19 per 10,000 athlete exposures. Boys' ice hockey, with 7.69 per 10,000 athlete exposures.\n\nWhen examining concussion incidence specifically in practice, the highest rates were observed in boys' football, with a rate of 5.01 per 10,000; followed by cheerleading, with a rate of 3.6 per 10,000; and boys' wrestling, with a rate of 3.12 per 10,000.\n\nThe data showed that, between the 2013-2014 and 2017-2018 school years, football concussion rates during competitions alone increased, but practice-related concussion rates dropped.\n\nThe only sport with a higher concussion rate in practice than competition\n\nThe study found that across all sports, most concussions -- 63.7% -- occurred during competitions. Only one sport had a concussion rate higher in practice than in competition: cheerleading.\n\nJUST WATCHED Cheerleader injury: Treat like athletes Replay More Videos ...

All 50 states now have laws in place for return-to-play and all high school coaches have to go through training,\" said Dreer, director of psychological and neuropsychology clinical research services in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nShe praised the study for shedding light on the public health issue of concussions, which she said often gets more attention at the collegiate and professional sports levels than in high school sports.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It really starts with the kids,\" Dreer said.\n\nBy the time young athletes make it to collegiate or professional levels, \"the damage is done,\" she said. \"We need more studies at the high school level, and even backing it up further with the little kids, to get more longitudinal data and better understand this issue so we can do things to prevent it, manage it and hopefully keep kids safe but active as well.\"", "description": "The rates of football practice concussions and recurrent concussions across all sports have gone down in recent years, according to a new study published in the journal Pediatrics.
