Arnav Gupta, an analyst at research firm Forrester, said some of the capital will likely be spent on Paytm\u2019s international expansion efforts in Japan and Canada. (Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: The company estimates it has a 70 per cent share of the domestic digital-payments market. But it\u2019s losing ground to Google Pay and Walmart-controlled PhonePe on transfers between bank accounts, a common way of making small retail purchases in the country. All three services face a significant challenge from Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which has 400 million Indian users and is launching a payments service this year. Paytm\u2019s international moves have focused on filling unserved consumer niches that it dominates back home, but its Canadian expansion is partly a result of circumstance. The company\u2019s first CEO, Harinder Takhar, set up a development shop in Toronto in 2014 because of the city\u2019s skilled banking and technology workers and his own fondness for the country during a stint at Research In Motion (now BlackBerry). It later launched a Canadian bill-payment app\u2014one of its first features in India\u2014because it didn\u2019t see a major competitor. However, Canadian consumers have more options in other significant Paytm revenue areas, like peer-to-peer payments and e-commerce.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
