Adam Kinzinger said, this was \u2018beyond repugnant\u2019.\n\nNo, my question relates to the issue of Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s $50,000-a-month employment with a Ukraine gas company while his father was Vice-President, and despite him having almost zero qualifications for the job.\n\nAnd in particular, whether Biden Snr intervened to stop an investigation into corruption that might have caused problems for his son.\n\nJoe Biden, right, with his son Hunter whose $50,000-a-month employment with a Ukraine gas company while his father was Vice-President is a cause for concern\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son,\u2019 Trump said on that Zelensky call, \u2018that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s true - there IS a lot of talk about it.\n\nYet the Bidens, and the Democrats, are adamant there\u2019s nothing to see here.\n\nIndeed, they express bafflement and rage that anyone would even seek to raise an eyebrow about it.\n\nYet I definitely have a few concerns that should be commanding a lot more attention from the mainstream media:\n\nObama made him his point man there after the overthrow of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, left, ostensibly to help new pro-Western president Petro Poroshenko, right, root out corruption\n\n1) What exactly did Joe Biden Do in the Ukraine? President Obama made him his point man there after the overthrow of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych in the 2014 revolution. Biden visited Ukraine at least a dozen times over the next two years, ostensibly to help new pro-Western president Petro Poroshenko root out corruption. But what was Biden really doing? We should be told.\n\n2) How and why did Hunter Biden come to land such a lucrative job in the spring of 2014 with Burisma, the largest private gas company in Ukraine? He doesn\u2019t appear to have any real credentials for it other than being the US Vice-President\u2019s son. We should be told.\n\n3) What did Hunter Biden do for Burisma? Who did he meet, what deals did he fix, what influence did he wield and how? How did he earn his $50,000 a month? We should be told.\n\n4) Why, as DailyMail.com reveals today, did Hunter\u2019s investment firm partner Chris Heinz \u2013 former Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s stepson \u2013 split from him when he joined Burisma because he was reportedly worried about Biden\u2019s poor judgement and how it would look? And did Heinz share those concerns with Joe Biden?\n\n5) What conversations did Biden Snr have with his son about Burisma? He says none, but Hunter previously said they had at least one. Neither answer seems credible given how close they were and what they were doing at the time in Ukraine. \u2018Ask the right questions\u2019 snapped Biden Snr when a reporter tried to push him on this last week. This is a perfectly right question to ask. We should be told.\n\n6) Did, crucially, Biden Snr interfere with any investigations into Burisma that were conducted because the owner Mykola Zlochevsky was close to ousted Yanukovych? We know Biden Snr boasted of successfully demanding to have Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired if the government wanted $1 billion in U.S. aid. But was another reason that he wanted to protect Hunter from being dragged into any Burisma probe? If that were true then Biden would surely be guilty of exactly the same kind of thing Trump\u2019s been accused of? Biden vehemently denies it, and no hard evidence has yet emerged to prove otherwise. But this is the key charge being leveled by a Trump campaign that ironically calls Biden \u2018Quid Pro Joe\u2019. Again, we should be told.\n\nDid Biden Snr interfere with any investigations into Burisma that were conducted because the owner Mykola Zlochevsky (above) was close to ousted Yanukovych?\n\n\u2018Biden doesn\u2019t have to answer for nothing,\u2019 said James Carville, the Democratic strategist and longtime adviser to the Clintons. \u2018There\u2019s one story here. The president of the United States tried to sic a foreign government on a political opponent.\u2019\n\nHmmm.\n\nThe last part of that statement is demonstrably true, because Trump\u2019s admitted it - though unless it is proven he deliberately withheld aid until Ukraine did any Biden dirt-digging, I don\u2019t see any impeachment being successful in the Republican-majority Senate.\n\nBut there\u2019s definitely more than one story here.\n\nAnd if Joe Biden wants to be President then he\u2019s going to have to stop pretending there isn\u2019t, stop barking \u2018ask the right questions!\u2019 at reporters to deter them from doing their jobs, and start answering some difficult questions.\n\nAnd this all leads me to the question I really want to ask, and it\u2019s this: what would the same Democrats who say there\u2019s nothing to see here be saying if we swap Hunter Biden\u2019s name for Donald Trump Jr?\n\nWe all know the answer.\n\nThey\u2019d be screaming blue murder about nepotism, conflict, corruption and collusion.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s time the media stepped up their investigations into the Bidens and Ukraine and put the same heat into those that they\u2019re currently, perfectly correctly, putting into Trump\u2019s phone call.\n\nBecause if they do, and they uncover something so dodgy it justifies what Trump said on that phone call or at least provides some mitigation, then it could well decide the next election.", "description": "My question relates to the issue of Joe Biden and his son Hunter's $50,000-a-month employment with a Ukraine gas company while his father was Vice-President", "authors": ["Piers Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/16/19113408-0-image-a-17_1569857478259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
