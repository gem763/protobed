Michael Waltz: Trump's Taliban decision was smart \u2013 He's showing leadership where Obama failed", "language": "en", "text": "PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Rep. Michael Waltz on \"Outnumbered Overtime\" on Monday, September 9 at 1 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump made the right call this weekend when he decided to call off peace talks in Afghanistan. For months, the Taliban has assured the State Department Afghanistan it will promote \u201cpeace\u201d and will no longer be a haven for terrorists. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth \u2013 and current events have made that abundantly clear.\n\nJust last week, the Taliban committed a suicide bombing that killed at least 16 civilians and wounded 119 people, with a U.S. soldier among these casualties. In July, the Taliban killed four Afghan security forces and a U.S. service member at a hotel.\n\nAll these attacks have occurred as the Taliban sat at the negotiating table and promised peace but refused to enter into a nation-wide cease-fire.\n\nPEACE TALKS WITH AFGHANS, TALIBAN CALLED OFF AFTER TRUMP CANCELS SECRET MEETING\n\nI understand the desire to get out of Afghanistan. No one wants peace more than the veterans like me who have lived these wars, fought them and lost fellow soldiers and friends on the battlefield.\n\nI know this feeling firsthand.\n\nLast month marked the 10-year anniversary of the death of Green Beret Brian Woods, my unit\u2019s first soldier killed in action in Afghanistan.\n\nAs his commander, he was my responsibility. Every day, I think of Brian \u2013 and because of losses like these, I share in America\u2019s frustration that the war in Afghanistan has been long, costly and painful.\n\nThis frustration has led to a misguided notion growing within American politics that U.S. military presence throughout the Middle East is no longer necessary \u2013 that we should simply bring our soldiers home under the best terms we can get and let regional actors handle these conflicts themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, the belief that U.S. military presence throughout the Middle East is no longer necessary \u2013 that we should simply bring our soldiers home under the best terms we can get and let regional actors handle these conflicts themselves \u2013 is erroneous.\n\nInstead of bringing peace to Afghanistan, this deal would have risked making the situation in Afghanistan far worse \u2013 and its impacts could have catastrophic effects not only for the country but for the world.\n\nWe saw this misguided belief play out in Iraq, when Obama withdrew troops too hastily, leaving Iraq to fend for itself as al-Qaeda morphed into ISIS, terrorized Europe and inspired attacks across the United States.\n\nWe cannot afford to do the same in Afghanistan. The stakes there are far higher.\n\nNot only could terrorism run rampant in Afghanistan but this agreement also doesn\u2019t address the hotbed of terrorism on the other side of the border in Pakistan.\n\nThe deal stops at Afghanistan\u2019s border, leaving Al Qaeda and others free to plot and plan in Pakistan.\n\nIf Afghanistan slides back into chaos and civil war it will drag Pakistan down with it, with five times the population and the potential for loose nuclear weapons. More foreign-based terrorist organizations operate along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border than any other region in the world, making it incredibly difficult for the Taliban to prevent terrorists from operating.\n\nThe 227,000-man Afghan National Army, the American military and its NATO allies all have struggled with this. And with a drawdown of U.S. troops, there will be even fewer assets to monitor and verify that the Taliban is upholding their end of the bargain \u2014 that is until it\u2019s too late.\n\nMore concerning is the Afghan National Government\u2019s exclusion from these negotiations. By not giving the Afghan Government a place at the table, we\u2019ve totally undercut its legitimacy, doing so on the eve of Afghanistan\u2019s presidential elections.\n\nThese elections \u2013 already difficult to pull off during a war \u2013 are sure to be contested. And without a strong American backing of the democratic process, the fragile Afghan society will slide toward civil war.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf President Trump does come back to the table, I hope he maintains the conditions-based strategy announced nearly two years ago to keep the terrorists on their back foot and continue to build the Afghan National Army over the long term until it can secure Afghanistan on its own.\n\nInstead of bringing peace to Afghanistan, this deal would have risked making the situation in Afghanistan far worse \u2013 and its impacts could have catastrophic effects not only for the country but for the world.\n\nPresident Trump was smart to cancel peace talks with the Taliban. He is holding the Taliban\u2019s feet to the fire. He is leading in foreign policy where his predecessor failed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe must continue to keep America first and prevent another 9/11 by staying on offense.\n\nWe owe it to all the soldiers like Brian who made the ultimate sacrifices on behalf of this mission. This is our responsibility \u2013 for the safety of the American people and the world.", "description": "I understand the desire to get out of Afghanistan.
