This has not happened. The original decision stands until set aside.\"\n\nVan der Westhuizen ordered the NPA to comply with the government notice of 2010 and ordered it to pay costs.\n\nElated\n\nWhen the PSA took the case to court, new NDPP Shamila Batohi reportedly went against a decision by Justice Minister Michael Masutha to oppose the application.\n\nFormer DDPP in Pretoria, advocate Retha Meintjes, welcomed the judgment.\n\n\"We are totally elated,\" Meintjes said.\n\nNews24 has asked the NPA for comment which will be added once received.", "description": "Past and present deputy directors of public prosecutions at the National Prosecuting Authority will finally receive their increases and benefits after a decade-long battle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6144/1f882409bb2e4cb19a50716f52b5ccd0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
