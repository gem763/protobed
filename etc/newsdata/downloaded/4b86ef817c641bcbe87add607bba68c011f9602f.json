It\u2019ll be replaced with a digital solution of some kind.\n\n60 Minutes exposed the monstrous floppy disks in 2014 when it ran a special on the nuclear mechanism \u2014 host Leslie Stahl called them \u201cthe really old kind. They were mentioned again in a report from the Government Accountability Office, which said the disks were \u201ca legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation\u2019s nuclear forces.\u201d Last Week Tonight reported on it in 2014 as well, whereupon host John Oliver said, on seeing 60 Minutes\u2019 footage of the disks: \u201cThose things barely look powerful enough to run Oregon Trail, much less Earth-ending weaponry.\u201d\n\nCredit: Government Accountability Office\n\nC4ISRNET reports that the military is junking the disks in favor of a \u201chighly-secure solid state digital storage solution.\u201d The \u201clegacy system\u201d mentioned in the GAO report is the Department of Defense\u2018s Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS). It runs on the IBM Series/1 computer, which was first created in 1976. It\u2019s \u201cdata storage solutions, port expansion processors, portable terminals, and desktop terminals\u201d were supposed to be replaced at the end of the 2017 fiscal year. We don\u2019t know if that actually happened, though I think the fact that it\u2019s 2019 and the floppies are only just being phased out should give you some idea.\n\nThere were acknowledged advantages to keeping the old tech for as long as possible. To paraphrase an aphorism, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t upgrade it. Lt. Col. Jason Rossi, commander of the Air Force\u2019s 595th Strategic Communications Squadron, said of SACCS, \u201cIt\u2019s the age that provides that security. You can\u2019t hack something that doesn\u2019t have an IP address. It\u2019s a very unique system \u2014 it is old and it is very good.\u201d\n\nStill, even the government has to acknowledge when systems are a little too old to properly maintain. According to C4ISRNET, the repairs required to maintain the SACCS system are so intricate and difficult (imagine trying to keep a 120-year-old person alive) that the military no longer trains airmen to handle them. They have to be done by civilians, since it\u2019d take years to get the average person up to the competency level required to do the work.\n\nSo now the floppy disks are getting a much-needed retirement, fingers crossed the military\u2018s digital storage is equally secure.\n\nThe US nuclear forces\u2019 Dr. Strangelove-era messaging system finally got rid of its floppy disks on C4ISRNET\n\nRead next: Report: Apple will announce AirPods Pro with noise cancelling this month", "description": "Enjoy your retirement, old school floppy disks!
