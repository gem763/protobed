(Image: Evan \u201cDoc\u201d Shaner, DC Comics)\n\nTom King\u2019s made a name for himself by telling stories about classic white guy heroes who find themselves on the verge of mental collapse as their worlds suddenly become complicated in ways one doesn\u2019t often see in comic books. At this year\u2019s New York Comic Con, the writer announced that Adam Strange will follow in that familiar tradition of his Vision and Mister Miracle series.\n\nAt DC\u2019s World\u2019s Finest panel at NYCC this year, Tom King, Mitch Gerads, Kami Garcia, Joelle Jones, Evan \u201cDoc\u201d Shaner and Joshua Williamson took to the stage to discuss the futures of some of DC\u2019s most complicated characters, and how all of the comics creators personally feel about the heroes and villains they\u2019ve been shepherding lately.\n\nThough the audience was definitely waiting for the Strange Adventures announcement, the panel made clear that there are still big, interesting things happening in DC\u2019s larger multiverse of thematically resonant, but narratively distinct stories featuring characters like Harley Quinn, Batman and the Joker.\n\nEven though Harley\u2019s become overexposed much in the same way that the members of DC\u2019s official Trinity have been for decades now, Kami Garcia, Mico Suayan and Mike Mayhew\u2019s Joker/Harley: Criminal Sanity sounds as if it might actually end up being the rare story that has something interesting to say about the clown duo\u2019s troubled history.\n\nDuring the panel, Garcia explained that while the comic is definitely, you know, a comic book, its story is also very much a procedural \u2014 one that tracks the evolution of a serial killer from the perspective of the psychiatrist tasked with observing and treating him. Though the book\u2019s definitely set in a version of Gotham that\u2019s a heightened reality, Garcia emphasised that the story\u2019s meant to be largely grounded and focused on the Joker\u2019s psychology, even consulting Dr. Fred Berlin \u2014 the psychiatrist who profiled Jeffrey Dahmer \u2014 in order to make the story feel more realistic.\n\nElsewhere in the DC Universe, the moment that DC\u2019s villains are having right now is set to continue with a new Flash event that sees a number of Barry\u2019s rogues realising that there\u2019s power in numbers, because a speedster can only deal with so many criminals at once.\n\nWilliamson explained that following the current \u201cDeath of the Speed Force\u201d arc, his \u201cRogue\u2019s Reign\u201d story will follow as the titular rogues descend upon Central City and make it their own, forcing the Flash into action. Williamson and King joked about the number of similarities between \u201cRogues Reign\u201d and King\u2019s current \u201cCity of Bane\u201d arc \u2014 which has seen Batman\u2019s backbreaking foe enact a grand plan to take Gotham for his own alongside a host of various villains \u2014 but King made clear that, beyond his work on Batman, he\u2019s still committed to bringing other kinds of energy to DC\u2019s books.\n\nCase in point: King, Gerads, and Shaner\u2019s upcoming Strange Adventures, a book King described as being a psychological exploration of the difference between the myths we tell ourselves about reality, and the truth of what reality actually is.\n\nYup. Sure as hell does sound like a Tom King book!\n\nThough the creative team didn\u2019t go into detail about what the series will explore, King explained that the reason two artists are working on the entire book is to convey that the story\u2019s heroes \u2014 including DC\u2019s classic adventuring rocketeer, Adam Strange, of course\u2014will constantly be grappling with two realities, but not in a strictly literal sense.\n\nIn order to convey perspective in different moments, both Gerads and Shaner\u2019s art will depict different takes on the same scenes, giving readers an understanding of the complex things happening to the person whose perspective you\u2019re meant be seeing things from. That person, King revealed, won\u2019t just be Adam Strange, however, because these adventures aren\u2019t just his alone.\n\nBeyond the teases, the biggest takeaway from the panel was that everyone working on DC\u2019s big upcoming titles feels creatively energised in ways that we\u2019re going to see reflected in their new books. That\u2019s good to hear, but what remains to be seen is if their enthusiasm will lead to series that draw readers in when these new books and storylines begin rolling out next year.", "description": "Tom King\u2019s made a name for himself by telling stories about classic white guy heroes who find themselves on the verge of mental collapse as their worlds suddenly become complicated in ways one doesn\u2019t often see in comic books.
