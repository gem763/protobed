At the same time, G8 Education wanted to take over Affinity.\n\nThe prosecution case alleges Ms Hutson had arranged the financing for Mr Elias\u2019 company to buy the Affinity shares.\n\nThe Takeovers Panel initially looked at dealings involving Mr Elias and Ms Hutson in September 2015 and ASIC again was interested in February 2016.\n\nMr Elias was questioned under the watchdog\u2019s all-powerful Section 19 examination in late February. But the court heard Mr Elias had a dinner with Ms Hutson the night before the questioning, at which she allegedly asked Mr Elias to give a version of events to ASIC.\n\nNotes from an ASIC officer\u2019s discussions with Mr Elias the following month were aired in court, stating: \u201c6pm, night before examination, wants me to lie to ASIC.\u201d\n\nMr Elias said he believed that would have referred to the meeting.\n\nHowever, Ms Hutson\u2019s lawyer, Neil Clelland, asked why the businessman had not mentioned this claim to ASIC during the February examination.\n\n\u201cI can't remember,\u201d he said on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElias 'not malleable'\n\nMr Elias this week in court has maintained he gave a true account of matters to ASIC.\n\nA company partly owned by Mr Elias' Print Mail had also borrowed funds from Ms Hutson\u2019s merchant bank Wellington Capital, and this was among issues also discussed at the dinner, the court heard.\n\nMr Elias maintained he had signed false documents presented by Ms Hutson at another occasion as an \u201caccommodation\u201d to her and because he wanted to avoid \u201cconfrontation\u201d.\n\nThat included documents the prosecution claimed had been handed over at Brisbane\u2019s Stamford Plaza in April 2016 to help support a cover story for separate allegations involving Ms Hutson\u2019s purported purchase of ANZ shares funded by G8.\n\n\u201cWhy ... sign documents in those circumstances, you being the law-abiding person who\u2019s always acted with propriety?\u201d Mr Clelland asked.\n\nMr Elias said he had taken a \u201cview very simply that this was an accommodation to her\u201d, and West Bridge had made an $800,000 profit from the childcare shares.\n\nIt was among a series of times he told court he had acted in certain ways on Ms Hutson\u2019s request.\n\nMr Elias rejected a characterisation of himself as a malleable person but agreed it was possible he simply acquiesced.\n\nThe hearing continues.", "description": "Merchant banker and former childcare executive Jenny Hutson is vigorously defending allegations in a court hearing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_255%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9a4c327675064c64ff865c7383700fc4dafc380c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
