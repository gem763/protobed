In conjunction with the main event, Busan International Film Festival also hosted its first Asia Contents Awards reflecting how the market is rapidly changing.\n\n\u201cThey gave us the resources and the freedom to make this properly,\u201d Michod said of working with Netflix.\n\n\u201cI like that I don\u2019t feel I am sacrificing myself at the altar of the box office,\u201d he added.\n\nSo called over-the-top (OTT) platforms or video-on-demand (VOD) \u2013- online services that viewers can access directly such as Amazon Prime, YouTube, Hulu and Apple TV \u2014 are booming.\n\nHollywood stars including Julia Roberts, Rooney Mara, Brad Pitt and Will Smith, have embraced streaming as audiences grow.\n\n\u201cIf people want to can go see (films) on the big screen they can, but my TV at home is amazing,\u201d Michod explained.\n\nDisney and Apple are set to launch their platforms across Asia Pacific this year, capitalising on growing mobile usage and rapidly improving access to faster speed internet.\n\nVivek Couto, executive director at research group Media Partners Asia, believes the region is \u201ccrucial\u201d to the plans of global streaming platforms as there are \u201cmassive prospects to go after\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Content boom \u2013\n\nOnline video revenue \u2014 predominantly from film and TV subscriptions as well as advertising \u2014 in the region will increase by 24 percent in 2019, making it worth $27 billion annually, according to a report by Couto\u2019s firm.\n\nThat figure is predicted to hit $50 billion by 2024.\n\nChina accounts for around 59 percent of revenue for the region in 2019, according to the report \u2013- but its strict regulations make access difficult for outside players with local platforms iQIYI, Tencent Video and Youku dominating.\n\nGoogle-owned YouTube earns the largest share of revenues in Asia, but Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney\u2019s Indian platform Hotstar have all experienced significant growth in the past few years.\n\n\u201cLocal content has historically been the preserve of large incumbent TV networks in markets such as India, Japan and Korea but as content and consumption moves online the availability and creation of premium local content becomes important,\u201d said Couto.\n\nHe added this would drive up demand, and create opportunities for subscription streaming and for advertisers.\n\nHBO Asia had the world premiere of its star-studded Malaysian co-production \u201cThe Garden of Evening Mists\u201d at BIFF.\n\nThe film is pan-Asian by design \u2014 starring Malaysian Lee Sinjee, Japan\u2019s Hiroshi Abe, and Taiwan\u2019s Sylvia Chang \u2014 but global in ambition.\n\n\u201cVOD platforms widen the distribution and amplify the presence of these Asian films to global audiences,\u201d the film\u2019s producers said in a statement to AFP.\n\nNetflix is rolling out 17 Asian productions, with the platform\u2019s first series from Thailand expected to debut by the end of the year.\n\n\u2013 Know your audience \u2013\n\nDespite the arrival of global giants, local platforms believe they can hold their own.\n\nThe Southeast Asian HOOQ platform this week announced 19 productions were in the works all made by film-makers from the region.\n\n\u201cAs a company that is built in Asia for Asians, we believe that local stories are best told by locals,\u201d argued Jennifer Batty, the company\u2019s chief content officer.\n\nSingapore-based documentary streaming service iwonder recently expanded into eight new southeast Asian markets\n\n\u201cAs we expand our offerings, a key focus will be finding documentaries from within those markets, accessing local voices who shine their own unique light on their world,\u201d said the platform\u2019s co-founder James Bridges.\n\nAdapting content to audiences needs will be vital to success.\n\nAround 250 million people regularly watch films on their mobile devices in India.\n\nIn response, Netflix introduced a mobile-only version of its streaming, but Asian firms may have the edge on understanding what local audiences want.\n\n\u201cWhere I think companies like ours in Asia have the edge is that we are up with the trends out here instantly. We are addressing the way people watch content in Asia,\u201d said Indian producer Ekta Kapoor, managing director of the VoD service ALT Balaji.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe are making shows designed to be watched on mobile devices, not adapted for them. Shorter-form, about local characters and issues. That puts us ahead.\u201d", "description": "Busan (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Acclaimed director David Michod\u2019s epic \u201cThe King\u201d was one of four major Netflix productions screened", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/eb4598_asia-is-as-an-important-global-streaming-industry-growth-plan-online-streaming-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
