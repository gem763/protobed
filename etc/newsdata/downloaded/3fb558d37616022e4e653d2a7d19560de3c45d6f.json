View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nShe is \u201ca top-notch diplomat, careful, meticulous, whip smart,\u201d and unlikely to have badmouthed Trump, either to Ukrainian officials or her colleagues, said John Herbst, a predecessor as ambassador in Ukraine who worked alongside Yovanovitch there in the early 2000s.\n\nThat reputation is all but impossible to square with what some view as a smear campaign, capped by the Trump administration\u2019s removal of Yovanovitch from her post in May. The move came as Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s lawyer, pushed Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump rival Joe Biden and his son. The former New York mayor labeled Yovanovitch a political hack bent on undermining those efforts, charges that apparently resonated with Trump.\n\n\u201cThe former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,\u201d Trump told Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 call, according to a partial transcript released by the White House. \u201cShe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nTo the diplomat\u2019s former colleagues, that makes no sense.\n\nYovanovitch \u201cis reserved. She is collected. She is not a flamboyant person,\u201d said Nancy McEldowney, a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria who said she has known Yovanovitch for about 30 years. Yovanovitch has always known that the role of diplomat \u201cwasn\u2019t about her\u201d but about \u201cserving American national interests and supporting the people around her.\u201d\n\nGiuliani \u201cis impugning every single person who works at that embassy, to say that any of our embassies around the world are partisan and favor one candidate over another. It defies the facts but is also really insulting,\u201d said McEldowney, who now directs a Foreign Service program at Georgetown University.\n\nCurrently a State Department fellow at Georgetown\u2019s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, Yovanovitch did not respond to emails seeking comment. The institute\u2019s director, Barbara Bodine, said the former envoy was declining all requests to speak with reporters.\n\nYovanovitch, 60, was raised in a household that helped prepare her for a career in international relations.\n\nBorn in Canada to immigrant parents \u2014 her father from the former Soviet Union and her mother from Germany \u2014 she grew up speaking Russian at home. The family moved to Connecticut when she was a young child, and she later became a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u201cLike so many, including those in the Ukrainian-American community, my parents\u2019 lives were changed forever by Communist and Nazi regimes,\u201d Yovanovitch said during a Senate confirmation hearing in 2016, attended by her 88-year-old mother. \u201cThey survived poverty, war and displacement, and finally arrived in the United States, with me in tow, in search of freedom, opportunity, dignity and accountability.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch attended Princeton University, where she majored in history and Russian studies. She joined the Foreign Service six years later, working as deputy director of the Russian desk before being posted to Canada, Russia, Great Britain and Somalia.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, she worked as the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Ukraine, as second-in-charge to Herbst, before being named ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, then to Armenia. She returned to Ukraine after President Barack Obama nominated her to be U.S. ambassador in 2016.\n\nShe arrived in Kyiv two years after Russia\u2019s forced annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and its continuing military intervention. As an envoy, Yovanovitch sought to reassure Ukrainian officials of U.S. support, while pushing them to root out widespread corruption .\n\n\u201cThe old oligarch system is still clinging to life, and corruption is its life support,\u201d she said in a speech in January to new graduates of the Ukrainian Leadership Academy. \u201cUkraine must continue to pursue economic reforms in line with European standards and fully empower all of its anti-corruption institutions.\u201d\n\nSome Ukrainian officials, including the country\u2019s top prosecutor, bridled against the pressure from the U.S. ambassador. In March, the prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, claimed that Yovanovitch had given him a list of people he should not prosecute. The State Department dismissed the statement as baseless and Lutsenko later recanted his claim.\n\nBut critics, led by Giuliani, accused her of working to undermine Trump\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cThe embassy in Ukraine was a \u2018Hillary Clinton for president\u2019 office. And they were looking to dig up dirt on President Trump,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThere was a lot more collusion with Ukraine than in Russia, where there doesn\u2019t appear to be any. They were trying to bring Trump down.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has not produced evidence to back up that assertion. As part of Senate confirmation hearings to ambassadorial posts, Yovanovitch reported that she made several small contributions to Democratic candidates in the early 2000s, but none more recently.\n\nSome former colleagues say she never voiced her U.S. political preferences and would not likely have tolerated such talk from embassy staff.\n\nYovanovitch, they said, is a notably private person and a stickler for details who often worked long hours. In Armenia, she pushed officials to ensure fair treatment of protesters arrested after contentious 2008 elections. Colleagues chose her for a State Department award given to an ambassador who shows extraordinary commitment to defending human rights.\n\nShe returned to Washington in 2012 and 2013, serving as the State Department\u2019s day-to-day contact with U.S. officials in Europe. Lee Feinstein, the U.S. ambassador to Poland at the time, recalled extended conversations with Yovanovitch about how to calibrate negotiations over missile development and a continuing U.S. military presence there.\n\n\u201cShe was always the kind of person who was very, very supportive of her ambassadors and looking to help them do their jobs better,\u201d said Feinstein, now dean of the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Relations at Indiana University. \u201cNever somebody who was trying to pursue her own agenda.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "To those who know Marie Yovanovitch, former US envoy to Ukraine, Trump's characterization that she was \"bad news\" couldn't be more off-base.", "authors": ["Adam Geller", "Jocelyn Noveck"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/marie-yovanovitch-2.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
