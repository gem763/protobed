Gov Rape Allegations Is A Bit Ironic", "language": "en", "text": "Hey, remember Virginia\u2019s Democratic lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax? He\u2019s the guy who forced the Democrats to absolutely eat it when it came to sexual assault allegations. They tried to clip the GOP with Brett Kavanaugh after he was smeared with baseless accusations of rape. Now, it was the Left\u2019s turn\u2014and they reacted all too predictably. Sexual assault is only bad when Republicans are accused of it. With the Left, it\u2019s \u2018circle the wagons\u2019 time. This issue, unlike Kavanaugh, hasn\u2019t been resolved. Fairfax has even used it to possibly launch a gubernatorial bid of his own as it has increased his name recognition. Never let a good sexual assault allegation go to waste. Fairfax\u2019s accusations, plus Gov. Ralph Northam's and Attorney General Mark Herring\u2019s admissions that they wore blackface put the party in a pickle. If this were a Republican administration, you bet the Democrats would demand resignations. They couldn\u2019t. If all three resigned, the Republicans would retake the executive in Virginia. It\u2019s better to be hypocritical than lose power in politics.\n\nWell, The Washington Post has had it enough with the waiting. Fairfax faces two credible accusations of rape. Both accusers don\u2019t want a criminal investigation, but one has said that she would be willing to testify before a committee. The reason: well, the truth needs to come out:\n\nJustin Fairfax\u2019s once-promising political career, and possibly his professional one, have hung in the balance since February when he was accused of sexual assault by two women, neither of whom had any apparent reason to lie. The Democrat has not helped his cause by alleging a smear campaign and conspiracy against him; by sliming one accuser by saying she was \u201cvery much into\u201d their sexual encounter; or, this month, by filing a lawsuit against CBS, which aired interviews last spring with his accusers, that looks frivolous on its face. [\u2026] There are two main procedural ways forward. One is the prospect of criminal investigations in Durham, N.C., where Mr. Fairfax is alleged to have raped an acquaintance at Duke University, in 2000, and Boston, where another woman says he forced her to perform oral sex on him, against her will, in 2004. Mr. Fairfax says both encounters were consensual. The other is for the House of Delegates in Richmond to undertake an impeachment hearing, with witnesses who would testify under oath. If the House recommended that Mr. Fairfax be removed, it would fall to the state Senate to decide his fate; he could be removed on a two-thirds vote. [\u2026] Among the problems with legislative inquiry is the possibility or likelihood that it devolves into political theater, or farce. Another is that whatever investigative authority the House may wield may not be adequate to compel testimony from some potentially relevant witnesses. Democrats, some of whom have called for Mr. Fairfax to resign, have opposed such a hearing, though it may hold just as much political peril for Republicans. \u2026a hearing remains the sole option that may be exercised at the General Assembly\u2019s discretion, and the only way to elicit sworn testimony by Mr. Fairfax and his accusers, among others, in a public forum not susceptible to stage managing by any of them. Whatever its imperfections, it is the most likely means to deliver an accounting to what is, at this point, the real jury: the people of Virginia.\n\nNow, the Post isn\u2019t the biggest sinner with regards to executing crusades to search for the truth that is both politically convenient and do the Democrats\u2019 slime machine work. You saw that with Kavanaugh. In fact, The New York Times took a face full of buckshot when they tried to rehash the allegations again over some new supposed victim who says she doesn\u2019t even know what the publication was talking about. It was a nothing burger\u2026again. The media embarrassed themselves again. They proved themselves to be enemies of the people, again. So, yeah\u2014don\u2019t expect this call to yield anything serious. Democrats cannot give an inch in Virginia, where all three leading state officials are in hot water, or should be in hot water, with those who busy themselves with finding things that are \"problematic\" in today\u2019s society. In the meantime, Fairfax has denied the allegations.", "description": ".09/16/2019 19:10:37PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/35/48d7f060-4de8-4ed3-adfb-1e21a88b630f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
