With a talented young core of hitters, Chicago thought it would be the first of multiple trips to the Fall Classic.\n\nBut the Cubs haven\u2019t returned to the World Series, and this year they will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe collapsing Cubs were eliminated from playoff contention shortly before losing their eighth straight game, falling 4-2 to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday night.\n\nBack-to-back wild pitches by David Phelps in the eighth inning enabled Pittsburgh to score the winning run. Just before Phelps\u2019 bout with wildness, Milwaukee clinched the second NL wild card with a 9-2 victory at Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cAny time you don\u2019t go to the postseason it\u2019s a weird feeling,\u201d Cubs starter Jon Lester said in a quiet clubhouse. \u201cWe just flat out didn\u2019t get it done. Teams played better than us and it (stinks). It really (stinks).\u201d\n\nPresident of baseball operations Theo Epstein hinted at midseason that he might make major changes to the roster if the Cubs didn\u2019t start playing better. That possibility now looms over the franchise.\n\n\u201cTheo and his guys will make those decisions,\u201d Lester said. \u201cThey might ask for some of the players\u2019 input but there\u2019s no way you can predict the future. We\u2019ve got to wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs could also be without manager Joe Maddon in 2020, even though he led them to the postseason each of the last four years. His contract expires at the end of the season, and there has been speculation he would not return if Chicago missed the playoffs.\n\nMaddon said before the game that he and Epstein had not discussed his future. Epstein declined to comment on Maddon\u2019s status.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say enough positives about what Joe has done,\u201d Lester said. \u201cNo matter what happens, if he continues here, it\u2019s gravy. If he doesn\u2019t, he should be revered (in Chicago) for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs have four games remaining. They finish the three-game series with the Pirates on Thursday, and then play the NL Central-leading Cardinals - who hold a 1\u00bd-game lead over Milwaukee in the division standings - in a three-game series starting Friday night at St. Louis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not used to this,\u201d Maddon said of playing games that only mean something to the opposition. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while and it\u2019s a really non-fun way to end the season.\u201d\n\nPhelps entered in relief with the score tied 2-2 and walked Pablo Reyes to put runners on first and second with one out. Jos\u00e9 Osuna drew a walk from Brad Wieck (1-2) before scoring on the wild pitches, and Erik Gonz\u00e1lez added a sacrifice fly.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez was 3 for 3 with two RBIs as Pittsburgh won for the second straight night over the Cubs following a nine-game losing streak.\n\nMichael Feliz (4-4) pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Keone Kela worked the ninth for his first save of the season. Kela has taken over as closer after All-Star Felipe V\u00e1zquez was arrested and jailed last week on felony charges including sexual assault of a minor.\n\nIan Happ homered and drove in both Cubs runs.\n\nBoth starters, Lester and Pirates rookie Dario Agrazal, pitched six innings and allowed two runs.\n\nHapp\u2019s homer leading off the seventh pulled the Cubs into a 2-2 tie and chased Agrazal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my last outing of the season and I wanted to finish strong,\u201d Agrazal said through a translator.\n\nEPSTEIN STAYING PUT\n\nEpstein said he has no plans of returning to the Boston Red Sox.\n\nSpeculation in Boston has centered on Epstein possibly replacing Dave Dombrowski, who was fired Sept. 8 as the president of baseball operations. Epstein is finishing his eighth season as the Cubs\u2018 president of baseball operations.\n\nEpstein oversaw Boston\u2019s baseball operations for eight seasons from 2003-10 before leaving to join the Cubs. The Red Sox won the World Series in 2004, their first title since 1918, then won again in 2007.\n\nHURDLE COMING BACK\n\nPirates manager Clint Hurdle said he has received assurances from team management that he will return next year for his 10th season. There was some question about Hurdle\u2019s job security with the Pirates assured of their first last-place finish in the NL Central since 2010.\n\n\u201cEvery conversation I\u2019ve had with (general manager) Neal (Huntington) is how we come back and get better, and anybody in the organization,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cSo, my mindset is I want to come back. I plan on coming back. The opportunity for us to improve and get better is important to me, as well as everybody I\u2019ve had conversations with.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCubs: 3B Kris Bryant (sprained right ankle) and SS Javier B\u00e1ez (fractured left thumb) will not play again this season.\n\nPirates: OF Bryan Reynolds left in the first inning with right hamstring discomfort after being injured while trying to beat out a grounder. \u2026 All-Star 1B Josh Bell (strained left groin), CF Starling Marte (sprained right wrist), C Elias D\u00edaz (sprained right knee) and INF Cole Tucker (strained left knee) have been declared out for the season. \u2026 RHPs Chad Kuhl and Edgar Santana, both recovering from Tommy John surgery, have thrown two-inning simulated games at instructional league camp in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCubs: LHP Jos\u00e9 Quintana (13-8, 4.55 ERA) will start Thursday night. Quintana has pitched a combined 8 2/3 innings and allowed 16 runs in his last three starts, though he did not factor in the decision in any of them.\n\nPirates: RHP Joe Musgrove (10-12, 4.49) is 2-0 with a 2.86 ERA in his last four starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Chicago Cubs felt they were in the beginning stages of a dynasty three years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Perrotto"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/cubs_pirates_baseball_72644_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
