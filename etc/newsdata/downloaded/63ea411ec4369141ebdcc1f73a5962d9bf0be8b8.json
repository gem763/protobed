REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo/File Photo\n\nIMF spokesman Gerry Rice said trade tensions were beginning to affect a world economy already facing challenges including a weakening of manufacturing activity not seen since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters he had not seen the new IMF forecast, but did not expect the impact to be as significant in the United States.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it in U.S. as that big an impact,\u201d he said, when asked about the IMF forecast after an event hosted by the New York Times.\n\nRice told a regularly scheduled IMF news conference that the global lender is to release a new revised economic outlook next month, but provided no details.\n\nWorld economic activity remained subdued, with trade and geopolitical tensions causing uncertainty and eroding business confidence, investment and trade, he said.\n\nThe IMF had previously forecast that the U.S.-China trade war and other trade disputes threatened future global growth, but Rice said the impact was now being felt.\n\n\u201cTrade tensions .... are not only a threat, but are actually beginning to weigh down the dynamism in the global economy,\u201d he said, adding U.S.-China tariffs \u201ccould potentially reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8% in 2020, with additional losses in future years.\u201d\n\nThat forecast is more gloomy than one earlier this year, when the IMF said tariffs already imposed and those planned could shave 0.5% off global economic output in 2020.\n\nMark Hamrick, economic analyst at Bankrate, a New York-based consumer financial services company, said the new forecast reflected skepticism that Washington and Beijing would end the trade war.\n\n\u201cTrade tensions have only grown. There is no agreement that is in sight,\u201d Hamrick said, noting that growing concerns in the business sector were starting to bleed into consumer sentiment.\n\nHamrick said the IMF assessment could fuel concerns about a U.S. recession after 11 years of expansion. Economists polled by Bankrate see a 41% chance of a recession by the time of the November 2020 presidential election, he said.\n\nAsked if the IMF anticipates a global recession, Rice said that was not in the fund\u2019s baseline at the moment. He noted that the IMF had used words such as \u201cvery precarious,\u201d \u201cvery fragile,\u201d and \u201cdelicate\u201d to describe the economic outlook.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Let\u2019s wait and see,\u201d he said, noting the forthcoming world economic outlook would provide greater clarity.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar and China yuan notes are seen in this picture illustration June 2, 2017.
