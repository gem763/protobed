Pettersen rolled in a putt from just over 6 feet to beat Alex Marina, 1 up, and give Europe the victory. The ending became even better when Pettersen, a captain\u2019s pick, announced her retirement.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for the Ryder Cup or Solheim Cup to come down to the final match. For the men, the last time it happened was in Wales in 2010 when Graeme McDowell beat Hunter Mahan on the 17th hole. It\u2019s even rarer for the cup to be decided on the 18th green by the last match on the course. Think back to Bernhard Langer\u2019s miss at Kiawah Island in 1991 that handed the Americans the victory.\n\nBut to make a putt from the last match on the course to determine who wins? That happened only once before, way back in 1933.\n\nHorton Smith, who the following year became the first winner at Augusta National, dispatched Charles Whitcombe to level the matches at 5\u00bd points each. It came down to Easterbrook and Denny Shute, who were all square playing the final hole at Southport and Ainsdale.\n\nShute went bunker to bunker and blasted out to 20 feet. Easterbrook found the left rough, laid up and hit to about the same distance. If they halved the match, the Americans as defending champions would have kept the cup. U.S. captain Walter Hagen said later he wondered if he should have told Shute how the matches stood, but he was chatting with the Prince of Wales and \u201cI thought it would be discourteous to walk out on the future king of England.\u201d\n\nEasterbrook lagged his putt about 3 feet short of the cup. With a chance to win the match, Shute gunned his putt about 4 feet by the hole and missed it coming back. The Englishman holed the final putt of the Ryder Cup, giving Great Britain & Ireland the victory.\n\nIt took 89 years for another moment like that, and to show how much the golf landscape has changed, consider what happened the following week: The players headed north to St. Andrews for the British Open.\n\nShute got over his disappointment quickly.\n\nThree shots behind Easterbrook going into the final 18 holes, Shute shot 73 and won a 36-hole playoff over Craig Woods for the first of his three major championships.\n\nCASEY\u2019S VICTORIES\n\nPaul Casey grew up in England, played college golf at Arizona State and has played around the world since turning pro - sometimes exclusively in Europe, recently only on the PGA Tour, lately a mixture of both.\n\nIt makes him chuckle to see the context of his victories.\n\nWhen he won the Valspar Championship in 2018, he heard references to his first victory in nine years. That was true - his first PGA Tour victory since 2009, when he won the Houston Open. More recently, he won the Porsche European Open in Germany, and it was his first European Tour victory in five years.\n\nHang on a minute.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t played that many times in Europe since rejoining the tour last year,\u201d Casey said.\n\nSince his victory in the KLM Open in 2014, Casey had played only seven regular European Tour events until his victory in September. He played once in 2015, the BMW Masters in Shanghai, the week after a World Golf Championship in Shanghai. He didn\u2019t play at all in 2016 and 2017, rejoining the tour to be part of the Ryder Cup again for the 2018 matches in Paris.\n\n\u201cAny win is special,\u201d Casey said.\n\nRAHM\u2019S THERAPY\n\nJon Rahm usually needs a little time to get over tough losses, and he was plenty disappointed after finishing runner-up to Danny Willett in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. But he had another round of golf on the immediate horizon, and that made him happy.\n\nRahm headed straight from Wentworth to St. Andrews for the Dunhill Links Championship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to play the Old Course with my dad for the first time, so there\u2019s a lot of positives to look at,\u201d Rahm said. \u201cIt will be in bad weather, which I believe is how golf is supposed to be played in Scotland, right? It is how it is. There\u2019s many reasons why I should be smiling.\u201d\n\nAnd then he offered one more.\n\n\u201cThe week after that, I\u2019m going to Spain,\u201d he said.\n\nDISTINGUISHED SERVICE\n\nThe PGA of America\u2019s highest honor is going to Nicklaus again - this time, Barbara Nicklaus.\n\nTwo decades after the wife of Jack Nicklaus was the first recipient of the \u201cPGA First Lady of Golf,\u201d she has been selected for the PGA Distinguished Service Award for her role in the health care of children as part of the Nicklaus Children\u2019s Health System in South Florida. She is chairwoman of a foundation that has raised more than $100 million for children\u2019s health in 15 years.\n\nJack Nicklaus, the 18-time major champion, received the award in 2000. They are the first husband-wife duo to each receive the award. Mark and Debi Rolfing were selected as joint recipients two years ago.\n\nThe award is for individuals who show leadership and humanitarian qualities, including integrity, sportsmanship and enthusiasm for golf. She will be honored Nov. 5 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, during the PGA\u2019s annual meeting.\n\n\u201cGolf has been a very important part of my life for almost 60 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has opened so many doors to allow me to attempt to give back to the game that Jack loved when I met him and to the game that I now love, cherish and support unconditionally. \u2026 Jack and I could never give back as much as we have been blessed to receive from this amazing game.\u201d\n\nON POINT\n\nThe PGA Tour still awards money, but it keeps score with points.\n\nStarting in 2020, every circuit run by the PGA Tour will base its Order of Merit - typically known as a \u201cmoney list\u201d - on points. It will be modeled after the FedEx Cup, which has been around since 2007, and most recently the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nThe points system now applies to the PGA Tour Latinoamerica, the Mackenzie Tour in Canada and the PGA Tour Series-China.\n\nLatin America previously used the U.S. dollar, while the Mackenzie Tour used the Canadian dollar and the PGA Tour Chian used the Chinese yuan. The tour said it is switching to points to help avoid confusion with currencies.\n\nThe PGA Tour Champions uses money for the regular season and then switches to points for the Charles Schwab Cup playoffs.\n\nDIVOTS\n\nWomen\u2019s British Open champion Hinako Shibuno rallied from eight shots behind to win on the Japan LPGA Tour for her fourth victory this year. Shibuno started the year at No. 561 in the women\u2019s world ranking. She now is No. 11. \u2026 Eighteen of the 24 players from the Solheim Cup are competing in Indianapolis this week on the LPGA Tour. \u2026 Former PGA champion Jeff Sluman now has made 1,000 starts on the PGA Tour (700) and the PGA Tour Champions (300). \u2026 Phil Mickelson and Justin Thomas are among those making their first start of the new PGA Tour season at the Safeway Open in Napa, California. \u2026 The BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth was the 16th time Rory McIlroy had opened with a 76 or higher. It was the first time he wound up with a top 10. His previous best after such a start was a tie for 24th at Wentworth in 2011.\n\nSTAT OF THE WEEK\n\nJon Rahm has not finished worse than a tie for 13th in his nine tournaments dating to the U.S. Open in June.\n\nFINAL WORD\n\n\u201cEverything that encompasses this event can rival the best of the best on the PGA Tour, in my opinion. I\u2019ll tell everyone if they are thinking about coming over here, go ahead and book that ticket.\u201d - Billy Horschel after his tie for fourth in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, his first regular European Tour event.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Suzann Pettersen is now linked with Syd Easterbrook, an English golfer and little more than a footnote in Ryder Cup history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Ferguson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/aptopix_britain_golf_solheim_cup_19555_c0-290-4536-2934_s1770x1032.jpg?8960500e71f25ab127b5db8860659ebef85b4bb7", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
