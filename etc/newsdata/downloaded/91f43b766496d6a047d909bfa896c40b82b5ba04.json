Though other students were injured in \u201cstampede\u201d to escape the building, they survived.\n\nA collapsing wall in another town, Koronadal, killed a 66-year-old man, local authorities told AFP.\n\nAt least 50 people were hurt by falling debris, including some seven pupils and teachers hurt escaping their collapsed elementary school.\n\nLocals were awed by the power of the quake, which was shallow and thus potentially more destructive.\n\n\u201cBuildings were not just moving, they were swaying,\u201d Gadi Sorilla, a doctor at a hospital in Tulunan, a town about 25 kilometres (15 miles) from the epicentre told AFP.\n\n\u201cI asked God for help,\u201d he said, adding the hospital had quickly received about 10 patients, some with head injuries.\n\nTulunan\u2019s mayor Reuel Limbungan said the local municipal hall had been heavily damaged and authorities had received \u201clots of reports of injuries\u201d.\n\nRescue teams have begun fanning out to assess the damage to the region, where electricity and phone services were knocked out by the power of the quake.\n\nThe US Geological Survey said the initial 6.6 magnitude quake was followed by a number of smaller shakes, including one measuring 5.8.\n\nThe continuing tremors were causing anxiety on the ground, with people refusing to go back inside buildings for fear of being caught in any resulting collapse.\n\n\u2013 Hundreds still displaced \u2013\n\nSchools across the area have been shuttered as a precaution.\n\nThe area is still suffering the effects of a 6.4-magnitude quake that hit less than two weeks ago, killing at least five people and damaging dozens of buildings.\n\nResidents fled homes across the Mindanao region and a mall caught fire in the city of General Santos shortly after the quake struck on October 16.\n\n\u201cWe still have 570 individuals in evacuation centres (from the previous quake) and with this quake, we are expecting more evacuees,\u201d said Zaldy Ortiz, an officer with a local emergency rescue team.\n\nOne of the deadliest quakes to hit the Philippines recently was in April, provoking the collapse of a building near the capital Manila.\n\nAt least 16 people were killed when the building pancaked in the worst-hit Pampanga province.\n\nHigh-rise structures in the capital swayed after the April quake, leaving some with large cracks in their walls.\n\nThousands of travellers were stranded after aviation authorities shut down the secondary Clark Airport, which is located on the site of the former US military installation that lies about an hour\u2019s drive north of the capital.", "description": "Manila (AFP) \u2013 A powerful earthquake struck the southern Philippines Tuesday, crushing two people under debris, cracking buildings and injuring", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/36cd93_philippines-suffers-regular-tremors-as-pacific-ring-strong-quake-kills-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
