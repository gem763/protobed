Supposedly the devices will begin manufacturing before the end of 2019, he says, and will be launched around about the middle of 2020.\n\nKuo believes Apple will be partnering with third-party companies to manufacture the AR headsets, though he's unsure who they may be. He also says they will likely be iPhone accessories like the original Apple Watch, as opposed to standalone devices. What that probably means is that your paired iPhone will provide the processing power, allowing the headset itself to be lighter.\n\nDon't Miss 1.2 K SHARES 331 SHARES\n\nIt's in fact a very good possibility that Kuo is right, given that Apple has been working on augmented reality hardware for years now. And given the new Apple Arcade platform, there's already an incredible way for potential AR game developers to exhibit their products.\n\nThere were other predictions in Kuo's report as well. He predicts that Apple is preparing to release the iPhone SE 2 in the first quarter of next year. It's been suggested the phone will have a similar design to the iPhone 8, but with the iPhone 11's chipset.\n\nThere's also likely going to be a new iPad Pro model and new MacBook in the first two quarters of 2020.", "description": "Google made an attempt to kick off the augmented reality market years ago with the Google Glass but failed miserably.
