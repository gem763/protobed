And there were too many 'TV losers' on. Little tryhards from other shows. So I said: 'Let's forget about that rubbish. Let's do more real cases that are serious.'\n\n'If someone was on there just to get noticed I would stop filming it and say ''Let's f*** these people off.'' They're not here for the right reason.'\n\nIt may be that the radio shock jock is referring to the first season where former Big Brother star Sky Wheatley and former Married At First Sight's Nasser Sultan appeared on the show.\n\nWho, me? It seems the shock jock was referring to reality stars such as former Big Brother star Skye Wheatley (pictured) who attempted to sue a medical travel agency for $35,000 in damages to fix her breast augmentation\n\nThe 25-year-old bubbly blonde attempted to sue Dani, owner of medical travel agency Medi Makeovers, for $35,000 in damages to fix her breast augmentation.\n\nWhile Nasser, 51, claimed photographer Jayden Seyfarth, 21, had cost him 'thousands' in brand deals by leaking 'false' information regarding staged photos they allegedly orchestrated together.\n\nHe claimed his name was worth $100,000, but later lost the case after Jayden produced call log from the date the photos of Nasser were taken.\n\nFame-seeker Married At First Sight's Nasser Sultan also appeared on the show last year claiming photographer Jayden Seyfarth, 21, had cost him 'thousands' in brand deals by leaking 'false' information regarding staged photos they allegedly orchestrated together\n\nEarlier this year, Kyle revealed there will be tantrums, security take-downs and someone even trying to seduce him as he presides over cases behind the gavel.\n\n'You can expect smashing of things, security intervening, yelling, screaming, racial cases, defamatory cases, theft, mother and daughter fights, major companies being taken to court, someone doing a sl** drop in front of the judge's chair,' he added.\n\nNo more D-listers: Kyle said there will be more 'real cases that are serious' in the latest season\n\n'And as usual, Anna [Heinrich] and I disagree on everything.'\n\nIn the show, the 48-year-old will preside over disputes between two conflicting parties and make a determination based on the evidence presented.\n\nTrial By Kyle premieres on October 24 on Channel 10.", "description": "He has just extended his radio contract deal worth a reported $40 million.", "authors": ["David Wu For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/01/19865460-0-image-a-9_1571360385634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
