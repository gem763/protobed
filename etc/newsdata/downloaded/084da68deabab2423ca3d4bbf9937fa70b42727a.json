Nothing unusual in that, except the Oxford United defender is leaving the cosy environs of League One for Real Kashmir, in the world\u2019s most militarised and politically sensitive territory.\n\nThe appeal of moving to a war zone - 800,000 soldiers are currently stationed in Kashmir - may be lost on most, but for Siddiqi, this transfer is about far more than football.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great story to show that it doesn\u2019t matter where you have come from, what your background or religion is, football transcends all of that,\u201d Siddiqi says, as we chat at Oxford's Kassam Stadium shortly before his departure. \u201cOver the last couple of years especially I\u2019ve been thinking about how I can do more.\n\n\"I see myself turning from a footballer to a diplomat. I feel sport has so much more to offer to the world but people are not understanding that and I want to stand up and go and show I\u2019m walking the walk.\n\n\"Football touches billions of people but what is its influence to the world\u2019s most pressing issues? It could do so much. Cristiano Ronaldo has more followers on social media than most countries have people. It\u2019s unbelievable. That power alone. I know it\u2019s harnessed commercially but how is it harnessed in a social impact way? Hardly at all.\u201d", "description": "In a few days, Kashif Siddiqi will fly out with his football boots to join a new club on loan.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212496806-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX7pHcCCmtgwidDdHSvx2cHE86QaQRwDHQBsfS7ZzE-Q.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
