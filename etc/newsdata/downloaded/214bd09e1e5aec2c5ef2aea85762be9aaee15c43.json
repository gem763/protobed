That would be reality. Consequently, the cudgels of their \u201cthree Rs\u201d campaign likely won\u2019t prevent another four years of the presidency that has been the bane of their existence. If anything, that campaign is likely to boost his reelection chances next year.\n\nThe first of the Left\u2019s three Rs stands for \u201cRussia,\u201d specifically the notion that President Trump is a compromised Putin stooge who, along with his campaign, conspired with the Russian government to steal the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHaving run with this seditious myth for more than two years, until Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report and his own congressional appearance wrecked the narrative, the Left quickly dumped the trope down the memory hole. Of course, for the more gullible Russia-gate dead-enders, the Left will tweak it every now and again to spur campaign contributions and voter turnout. For those who produced, perpetuated, and pimped this big lie\u2014and who may well find themselves in legal jeopardy\u2014the Left will only trot out the Russian-collusion scam for a broader audience on an as-needed basis, so as to provide a faux, affirmative defense for their potential malfeasance.\n\nRegrettably for the Left, these reappearances of the Russiagate scam necessarily will occur as more revelations about (and the attendant consequences for) those Democrats who abused the police and surveillance powers of the state to spy on their opponent\u2014i.e., the vindicated President Trump, who doubtless will benefit by using every such opportunity poignantly to remind voters why the dishonest Left cannot be trusted with our national security, surveillance, or any other powers of the federal government.\n\nSmall wonder the Left was quick to pivot to the second of its three Rs: racism.\n\nDespicably, this is neither a new nor an unexpected trope of the Left, which has inveterately trashed Republican presidents, nominees, and just about every apparently effective GOP candidate and officeholder as racist. Upping the ante today, though, the Left is committed anew to Hillary Clinton\u2019s smear of Trump supporters as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cirredeemable,\u201d openly insisting that all Trump supporters are racists in thought and deed. Moreover, as the 1619 Project of the New York Times evinces, the Left is also commencing to \u201creframe\u201d\u2014i.e., distort beyond all recognition\u2014U.S. history so that, regardless of their political affiliation, those who support American exceptionalism or the traditional notion that America is an inherently decent nation, are said to be supporters or abettors of white supremacy.\n\nYet the vast majority of Americans love their country and believe in the innate decency of their fellow citizens. Therefore, as a political strategy, for the Left to claim patriotism is racism is bat dung nuts; and amounts to but another way these radicals will pave the way to their own electoral Hell\u2014four more years of Orange Man Bad.\n\nPerhaps this helps explain the Left hedging its bets with the third of its three Rs: recession. Yep, that\u2019s right: in the midst of a booming economy, the Left is also pinning its hopes for electoral salvation on some kind of economic calamity.\n\nHaving risibly tried to hijack the credit for the robust Trump economy in claiming it was a legacy of President Obama, the Left now gravely intones about \u201cbond yield curves\u201d and speaks of impending recession. That this American economic recession has not yet materialized or even loomed on the economic horizon is of no concern to the Left. In fact, if the recession was truly pending, the Left already would be decrying it as a \u201cGreat Recession!\u201d And, if the recession were actually occurring, the Left would already be decrying it as \u201cthe worst downturn since the Great Depression!\u201d\n\nThe reason is simple: the Left\u2019s argument is aimed at consumer confidence which, if shaken enough, will spur a recession and slow the \u201cGreen Wave\u201d of prosperity buoying President Trump\u2019s 2020 chances.\n\nBut such an argument possesses the intrinsic tactical weakness inherent in so much of the Left\u2019s messaging, because it asks a question that, to the vast majority of Americans\u2019 minds, is merely rhetorical: \u201cWho are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?\u201d\n\nVoters whose prosperity and economic opportunities have increased will believe their own eyes; and, prodded by the Left\u2019s economic messaging, will recall the anile Obama economy and reward the president who made their prosperity possible.\n\nAs we brace ourselves to do our civic duties and go forth as happy warriors, we will take our case for keeping America great to the voters secure in our principles, policies, and faith in our fellow sovereign citizens; all the while amused and aware that come November 2020, the Left\u2019s plan of harping on the three Rs of Russia, racism, and recession will spawn a fourth R: Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nContent created by the Center for American Greatness, Inc. is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a significant audience.
