His office also denied that the intelligence committee had reviewed or received the complaint in advance.\n\n\u201cLike other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled Committees, the whistleblower contacted the Committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Community,\" Patrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff and the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News.\n\n\"This is a regular occurrence, given the Committee\u2019s unique oversight role and responsibilities. Consistent with the Committee\u2019s longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General and to seek legal counsel,\" Boland said.\n\nThe revelation led Trump to accuse Schiff of helping to write the whistleblower complaint, which alleged misconduct by the president when he spoke to Ukrainian premier Volodymyr Zelensky in July.\n\n\"It shows that Schiff is a fraud. ... I think it's a scandal that he knew before,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"I'd go a step further. I'd say he probably helped write it. ... That's a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it too. It's a scam.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTrump has zeroed in on Schiff, who he has branded \u201cshifty Schiff,\u201d for particular criticism, specifically over the chairman's recital of an inaccurate and exaggerated version of Trump\u2019s call at a hearing last week. Schiff has said that the reading was merely a \u201cparody\u201d of the call, but Trump has demanded he resign over the move.\n\nFox News reached out to Schiff's office, as well as the whistleblower's legal team, but there was no immediate response to questions about the whistleblower's disclosures to the ICIG.\n\nFox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "The intelligence community whistleblower who alleged misconduct at the White House over President Trump\u2019s call to the Ukrainian president did not disclose contact with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s staff to the intelligence committee inspector general (ICIG), sources told Fox News Friday.", "authors": ["Catherine Herridge", "Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel", "Fnc", "Based In Washington", "D.C.
