You can always put on a pretty dress, but it doesn\u2019t matter what you wear on the outside if your mind isn\u2019t strong. There is nothing more attractive \u2013 you might even say enchanting \u2013 than a woman with an independent will and her own opinions.'\n\nMaddox Jolie-Pitt\n\nPhoto credit: J.
