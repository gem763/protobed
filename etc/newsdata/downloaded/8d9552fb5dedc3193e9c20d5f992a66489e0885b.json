The former Texas governor also tried to get a former campaign donor appointed to the board of Ukraine\u2019s state-owned natural gas company.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry further heats up, the Energy Department announced Perry would travel to Belgium, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia next week, and Trump said he would nominate Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette to succeed Perry at the agency.\n\nDemocrats originally subpoenaed the former Texas governor on Oct. 10 for a host of records related to a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the heart of the probe, as well as documents concerning his frequent travel to the country and meetings Perry\u2019s held with Ukrainian officials.\n\nPerry has acknowledged asking Trump to make the July phone call with the Ukrainian president at the heart of the probe, as well as working on the administration's policy with the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. He\u2019s argued his concerns were centered on general corruption in the country and strongly denied hearing of any effort to seek political ammunition against Biden in exchange for U.S. military support.\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo in the sense of what those folks out there would like for it to be: We\u2019re [not] going to give you this money unless you go investigate Joe Biden and his son,\u201d Perry said in a Fox News interview. \u201cI never heard that said anywhere, anytime in any conversation.\"\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters Thursday, however, that the administration did indeed hold up military funds to Ukraine to obtain a political probe sought by Trump, undercutting prior denials of a quid pro quo.\n\nCalls have been mounting around Capitol Hill among Democrats \u2014 and even Republican Rep. Francis Rooney (Fla.) \u2014 for Perry to cooperate as part of the inquiry and testify. Democrats on the three committees conducting the probe argue that as one of the \u201cthree amigos\u201d responsible for Ukrainian policy in the administration, Perry almost certainly has relevant testimony.\n\nIn an interview earlier Friday, Perry said he would defer to Energy Department counsel on whether to comply with the subpoena or offer testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry. He also criticized the \u201calmost crazed idea\u201d of impeachment as well as how Democrats are conducting it.\n\n\"If they're going to do this, they need to at least follow the historic rules,\" Perry said. \"And they're not.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/de/bb/7b2ac4134bdaad052651a77e6f3e/191018-perry-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
