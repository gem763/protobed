See and shape the future; engage and develop others; reinvent constantly; value results and relationships; and embody the values.\n\nCHICK-FIL-A DIRECTOR'S PEACE OFFERING TO 'STRESSED OUT' POPEYES EMPLOYEES GOES VIRAL\n\n\"And if you'll look at that closely, you'll realize Jesus had it right 2,000 years ago,\" Miller said during an 18-minute interview. \"When his disciples wanted positions of leadership, he said, 'You don't understand leadership...Those that want to be greatest among you - the greatest leaders - must be willing to become servants.'\"\n\nThe training expert said they \"do it the old fashioned way\" with a two-part mission -- to build a leader's skills and heart.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd it doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon as Chick-fil-A's CEO, Dan Cathy, promised his father Truett Cathy to uphold the Christian values and remain closed on Sundays.", "description": "Chick-fil-A is America's favorite fast-food restaurant and it's not just because of their chicken sandwich, waffle fries, or Chick-fil-A sauce.", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
