Sad to say,\u201d Pelosi had said upon leaving.\n\nTrump posted on Twitter on Wednesday night - \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d with a photo of Pelosi standing up and pointing at him during the meeting.\n\nThe Democrats exited the meeting complaining that they were expecting to hear Trump provide details on a plan for dealing with an unfolding \u201ccrisis\u201d in Syria but instead were subjected to \u201cderogatory\u201d language from him about congressional Democrats and Democratic former President Barack Obama.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, in a statement, called Pelosi\u2019s decision to walk out \u201cbaffling but not surprising.\u201d\n\nShe added that after Democratic leaders \u201cchose to storm out,\u201d remaining Republican leaders held a productive meeting.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw American forces ahead of a Turkish offensive last week into northern Syria against U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters, removing their protection, has been roundly criticized, even by fellow Republicans. The Americans and the Kurds had fought alongside each other against Islamic State militants, some of whom were captured and jailed under Kurdish control in Syria.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speaks to reporters with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nA Democratic source familiar with the meeting said Trump referred to fewer than 100 Islamic State (ISIS) prisoners escaping after the president\u2019s decision and that those were \u201cthe least dangerous\u201d ones.\n\nThe source said that Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed the number of fewer than 100 but did not acknowledge that they were the least dangerous of those being held in prison.\n\nThe source added that Schumer pressed Esper on whether Turkey or Syria have ensured that the remaining prisoners be kept in jail. Esper, the source said, told lawmakers he did not have such intelligence reports.\n\nPelosi said Trump was upset at the start of the closed meeting because so many Republicans joined Democrats to vote for a resolution condemning his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria.\n\nThe vote was 354 to 60, with dozens of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans joining the majority Democrats. The split underscored deep unhappiness in Congress over Trump\u2019s action, which many lawmakers view as abandoning loyal Kurdish fighters.\n\n\u201cI think that vote - the size of the vote, more than 2-1 of the Republicans voted to oppose what the president did - probably got to the president. Because he was shaken up by it,\u201d Pelosi said after emerging from the White House.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic source familiar with the meeting said that when Pelosi and Hoyer were getting ready to walk out, Trump said to them: \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the polls.\u201d Nineteen Democratic contenders are seeking their party\u2019s nomination to run against Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was disappointed to see Democratic leadership walk out of the meeting.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) walks out with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to speak with reporters after meeting with President Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S. October 16, 2019.

He didn\u2019t really have one,\u201d Schumer said.", "description": "U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democratic leaders cut short a meeting with Republican President Donald Trump after he had a \"meltdown\" over a House of Representatives vote condemning his Syria withdrawal and showed no signs of having a plan to deal with a crisis there.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441648326&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1WI", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
