Little did the population know that Britain\u2019s fate might depend on the Automobile Association, a phone box and a prime minister making a reverse-charge call.\n\nLord Mountbatten, then chief of the defence staff, faced the problem of what to do in the event of a four-minute warning if Harold Macmillan was away from his desk.\n\nThe answer lies in documents at the National Archives described by Peter Hennessy, the historian, as \u201cthe most bizarre file I have ever discovered\u201d. Covering the years 1961-62, the file detailed Lord Mountbatten\u2019s Cold War concerns.\n\n\u201cThe real worry in the face of this increased Soviet menace was that the prime minister might be out of town in his Rolls-Royce, and what they would do, as he would have to authorise the retaliation,\u201d Hennessy told the Cheltenham Literature Festival.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury didn\u2019t want to spend any money; Macmillan didn\u2019t want to have any fuss at all. The answer was to use the Automobile Association.\u201d", "description": "During the Sixties, fears of a nuclear war ran high.", "authors": ["Anita Singh", "Macer Gifford", "Madeline Grant"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212302617-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVKajsirQyVDkJawVEXDBal_SzP1O-RCZ6liamTiommY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
