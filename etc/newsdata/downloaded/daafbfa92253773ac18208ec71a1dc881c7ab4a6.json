The country looks set to introduce crypto tax laws \u201cbefore New Year,\u201d with MPs speaking of the cryptocurrency industry providing \u201chuge potential for economic growth.\u201d\n\nPer a Facebook post from MP Alexey Zhmerenetsky, a group of 50 parliamentarians have drafted two cryptocurrency bills in conjunction with blockchain business groups, pro-blockchain lobbyists and the country\u2019s Ministry of Digital Affairs.\n\nThe bills, which have now been shared online, are open for public consultation for the next two weeks, after which, Zhmerenetsky noted, they will be brought before the country\u2019s parliament.\n\nThe MP wrote,\n\n\u201cWe will ask President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider the bills as urgent, because [they will provide] a huge potential for economic growth amounting to billions of dollars. Before we welcome in 2020, we will have launched a new era of blockchain-powered economics in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe first bill requires individuals and companies to report cryptocurrency transactions in excess of USD 1,200 to financial regulators, providing seller and buyer information, including personal data, company information and wallet addresses.\n\nThe second bill classifies tokens into two categories: \u201ctoken-assets\u201d and \u201ccrypto-assets.\u201d The second category includes tokens that do not \u201cimply\u201d property rights, and would include Bitcoin and most major altcoins. This is the category that would be subject to taxation.\n\nThe bills also contain measures that would force companies in Ukraine dealing with cryptocurrencies to comply with anti-money laundering protocols.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, they would provide a legal basis for cryptocurrencies, which are currently unregulated in Ukraine \u2013 a situation that Zelensky wants to redress as soon as possible.\n\nEarlier this month, the Ministry of Digital Affairs announced that it wants to provide legal definitions of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-related terms, also before year\u2019s end. The ministry also hopes to provide miners with a legal footing.", "description": "Ukraine\u2019s parliament is looking to push through cryptocurrency regulation in the final months of the year.
