But a year later, when it became part of the soundtrack to the Oscar-nominated film, it took on a whole new life in the public's imagination.\n\nAnd it has remained there for five decades.\n\n\"Initially, I thought, well, wait a minute \u2014 it's about motorcycles. The last thing that I know Peter [Fonda] did was something called The Wild Angels, and that was a bit of a turkey, so you know, what's this going to be like?\" the Canadian musician told As It Happens host Carol Off.\n\nBut then he and some other musicians were treated to a private screening of the film. He says they walked in during the opening scene, where Fonda and Hopper complete a cocaine sale to the The Pusher \u2014 another Steppenwolf track.\n\n\"And then the ending came,\" he said. \"And there was just complete silence in the room.\"\n\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of the movie \u2014 which starred Fonda and Dennis Hopper, who also directed \u2014 a screening with a live performance of the soundtrack is taking place in New York at Radio City on Sept. 20.\n\nCanadian-born Dennis McCrohan wrote Born to Be Wild, Kay said.\n\nMcCrohan initially billed himself as Dennis Edmonton as a member of the Toronto-based band The Sparrows \u2014 the precursor to Steppenwolf. By the time he wrote Born to Be Wild, he had changed his name again, this time to Mars Bonfire.\n\n\"And since his brother was the drummer in the newly-formed Steppenwolf band ... Mars brought this cassette tape of a couple of tunes he had written to a one of our rehearsals,\" Kay said.\n\n\"And we started kicking that song around, and liked the results. It was one of 11 tracks of our first album.\"\n\nActor Peter Fonda, left, and singer John Kay greet fans as they arrive for the 2004 edition of Canada's Walk of Fame awards in Toronto.

(Peter Jones/Reuters)\n\nKay said Steppenwolf's label decided that, contrary to the convention of the time, Born to Be Wild would be released on a double-sided single, but that neither it nor the opposite track (Everybody's Next One) would be designated the A-side. The idea was to let radio stations determine which of the two would be the hit track.\n\n\"Well, within short order,\" Kay said, \"eight out of 10 that were playing either side were playing Born To Be Wild, and then it took off. That was the summer of '68.\"\n\nBut, according to Kay, it wasn't until the following year when it was featured on a Hollywood soundtrack that Born to Be Wild truly transformed into an international phenomenon.\n\nThis Harley-Davidson 1200, built in 1993, is a replica of the 1969 model ridden by the late Peter Fonda in the film Easy Rider.
