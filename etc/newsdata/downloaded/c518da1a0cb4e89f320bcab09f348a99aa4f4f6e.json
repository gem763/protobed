Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, announced immediately after the vote that the government would publish the complete document.\n\nWhy it matters: The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said that the loss was \"an unwelcome distraction rather than a disaster\" for May, but it highlights just how incredibly difficult it will be to get the Commons to back her Brexit deal \u2014 and potentially, her premiership \u2014 in next week's critical \"meaningful vote\" on the issue.", "description": "For refusing to publish its full legal analysis on Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/blUJnRPFd49j1NQBEeCVURgbb7k=/0x36:1409x829/1920x1080/2018/12/04/1543943716242.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-04"}
