Earlier, a broadly grinning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman walked up to greet Mr Putin on his arrival. The crown prince later engaged in a conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nMr Putin even paused to admire a traditional curved knife, a janbiya, worn by a member of the Saudi honor guard on hand.\n\nIn brief remarks, the 83-year-old King Salman praised relations between Riyadh and Moscow, especially energy agreements. At a recent OPEC meeting in Abu Dhabi, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz described the arrangement as \"'til death do us part.\"\n\nPrince Abdulaziz briefed both leaders before a signing ceremony at the palace on 20 agreements between the two nations.\n\nMr Putin praised King Salman's efforts at maintaining relations, noting the monarch's 2017 trip to Moscow.\n\n\"Russia sees the expansion of friendly and mutually beneficial ties with Saudi Arabia as particularly important,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaudi Arabia likely wants to talk about ongoing tensions gripping the wider Middle East, where the kingdom is locked in a standoff with its archrival Iran and Turkey's military campaign in Syria has launched an added crisis.\n\nSaudi Arabia also remains worried about Iran. Since President Donald Trump pulled out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers over a year ago, risks have risen in the Persian Gulf. Since the summer, a series of attacks have targeted oil tankers in the region.\n\nThese attacks culminated in a September 14 drone-and-cruise-missile assault that knocked out half of Saudi Arabia's oil production. The US blames Iran for the attack, something Tehran denies. Yemen's Houthi rebels, whom the kingdom has been battling since March 2015, claimed the assault, though analysts say the missiles used wouldn't have the range to reach the targets in the kingdom from Yemen.\n\n\"We look forward to working with Russia to achieve security and stability and fight terrorism,\" King Salman said.\n\nAAP", "description": "The Russian president seeks to cement Moscow's political and energy ties across the Mideast as he visited Saudi Arabia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3348%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/469bbca15facac9fdbd482c694c39bc8b62c4cbf", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
