Tehran has ruled out negotiating any new agreement.\n\nIn reaction to tightened U.S. sanctions on its vital oil exports since exiting the deal, Iran has gradually scaled back its commitments under the agreement and has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, through which an estimated one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes.\n\nAt the General Assembly, Rouhani is expected to call for a \u201ccoalition for hope\u201d in the Gulf that \u201cwill secure freedom of navigation, flow of energy and the regional stability in the Persian Gulf,\u201d a senior Iranian official told Reuters.\n\nThe shadow of war has lengthened after a Sept. 14 air strike on the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, which included damage to the world\u2019s biggest petroleum-processing facility, knocking out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\nThe United States, the European Union and Saudi Arabia have blamed the attack on Iran, instead of the Yemeni Iran-aligned Houthi group that claimed responsibility. Iran distanced itself from the attacks, but said it was ready for \u201cfull-fledged\u201d war.\n\nThe escalating confrontation could tip the balance of power in Iran in favour of hardliners looking to constrain Rouhani\u2019s ability to open up to the West, particularly because Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s aversion to Washington remains a formidable barrier to any diplomatic solution.", "description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will give a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday that will likely determine whether Tehran will re-engage with the United States to ease the heightened tension between the longtime enemies.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433619317&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O07J", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
