Trump is obviously a fighter, and it\u2019s not even clear impeachment proceedings will harm him. When the House impeached Bill Clinton in 1998, his popularity improved, largely because voters saw him as the victim of political overreach by Republicans. The same could happen to Trump.\n\nBut Trump is arguably in a tougher spot than Clinton, whose offense was lying about an extramarital affair under oath. Trump appears to have subordinated national security concerns to his personal political interests and used taxpayer aid money appropriated by Congress as a kind of bribe to goad Ukraine into digging up dirt on Joe Biden. Foreign policy and national security are core presidential responsibilities, and Trump may have badly abused his power.\n\nTrump could probably survive impeachment, assuming the majority of Republicans in the Senate would vote not to convict him. But this is treacherous terrain for Trump. Republican senators might not be as averse to a conviction as some might think. If the Senate did convict Trump and he left office, they wouldn\u2019t be handing the presidency to Democrats. They\u2019d be trading Trump for Vice President Mike Pence, who would become president. If able to do that in one fell swoop, the many Republican senators who supposedly revile Trump in private might just go for it.\n\nTrump could also choose to resign because he concludes he can\u2019t win in 2020, and would rather quit than lose. It\u2019s also possible Trump could choose to leave so Pence can pardon him, rather than risk defeat in November. There\u2019s evidence in the Mueller report and elsewhere that Trump committed campaign finance felonies in 2016 and possibly obstruction of justice when he was president. Once he leaves office, Trump is vulnerable to prosecution, and there\u2019s no guarantee that a Democrat would pardon him.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis More\n\nHow would markets react?\n\nSo if Trump resigned, how would stock markets react? Euphorically. From a business perspective, the best of the Trump agenda\u2014tax cuts and deregulation\u2014would remain in place. But the worst of the Trump agenda\u2014tariffs, protectionism, xenophobia and political interference with the free market\u2014would dissipate. It might take a couple hours for markets to sort it out, but replacing Trump with Pence would almost certainly cheer investors.\n\nBefore he was a Trump yes-man, Pence was a more traditional Republican, supportive of free trade and limited government. He probably wouldn\u2019t abandon everything Trump stands for, but he\u2019d probably ditch the worst of it, including:\n\nTariffs. Trump is almost alone among Republicans in his crusade to wall off the U.S. economy, cut down on trade and punish trading partners with tariffs\u2014which also hurt the U.S. economy. Pence might look for other ways to keep the pressure on China, such as coordinating with allies to reform the World Trade Organization. But it\u2019s hard to imagine he or any other Republican would keep the Trump tariffs in place at the levels they\u2019re at now. This is the single-biggest policy cloud hanging over markets, which would rally if the clouds parted.\n\nImmigration. A tough stance on illegal immigration is popular among conservatives, but Pence could ease up on legal immigration and raise quotas or find other ways to let more people legally migrate to the United States. Many economists say we need more legal immigration, not less, to deal with labor shortages, boost entrepreneurship and expand a labor force that must finance Social Security and Medicare for the baby boomers. Pence would probably be friendlier to immigrants than Trump has been.
