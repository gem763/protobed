How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?\u201d\n\nThunberg\u2019s rage hearkened back to the youth-led Climate Strike last Friday, in which an estimated 4 million people took to the streets across the globe.\n\n\u201cFor more than thirty years,\u201d Thunberg said, \u201cthe science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away?\u201d\n\nThunberg said she would prefer to believe that present-day leaders simply do not understand the extent of the crisis.\n\n\u201cYou say you hear us and understand the urgency,\u201d she said. \u201cBut no matter how sad and angry I am, I don\u2019t want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and went on failing to act, you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were briefly in attendance. Trump has publicly questioned the scientific consensus that humans are causing the earth\u2019s climate to change in dangerous ways (97 percent of the world\u2019s climate scientists say that is the case).\n\nThunberg said that even existing efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half within ten years are woefully inadequate.\n\n\u201cThe popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in ten years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C degrees, and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those numbers don\u2019t include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of justice and equity.\u201d\n\nBut, she said, \u201cthere will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures today. Because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are failing us,\u201d Thunberg concluded. \u201cBut the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this.\u201d", "description": "Sixteen-year-old face of climate activism tells stunned leaders that her entire generation has been betrayed by their inaction", "authors": ["Jay Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_720,w_1280,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569256496/gretaclimateUN_ehk6j7", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
