Some argue French law already bans girls from wearing headscarves inside state schools and mothers should be made to comply with the same strict neutrality rules imposed on French state workers, such as teachers, who cannot wear religious symbols in the classroom.\n\nOne mother, identified only as Fatima E, spoke out about her experience of being told to remove her veil in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 regional parliament building by Julien Odoul from Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party.\n\nA fierce row had broken out in the chamber when the regional parliament speaker, the Socialist Marie-Guite Dufay, replied to Odoul, saying that neither French law nor the rules of the chamber banned a member of the public wearing a headscarf.\n\nFatima, who was pictured comforting her distressed 10-year-old son in the public gallery, told the Collective Against Islamophobia in France: \u201cI felt rejected in a way I never had been before.\u201d\n\nShe was a regular volunteer on school outings, and her son\u2019s teacher had asked her to come on the trip. \u201cI heard someone say \u2018in the name of secularism\u2019 and I heard people start shouting and getting angry,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I saw was the children\u2019s distress. They were really shocked and traumatised \u2026 They kept turning round to me, saying, \u2018But it\u2019s [directed] at you! Is it you they\u2019re telling to take off your headscarf?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said of the politicians who told her to uncover her head: \u201cThey have destroyed all the work I was doing indirectly with this class, where children of immigrant roots often had an attitude of thinking France was against them.\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident, a nursery school visit to a fire station in Creil, north of Paris, failed to go ahead on Monday when a firefighter told a mother accompanying the trip that she had to remove her headscarf. The fire service later said it was a mistake and the officer apologised.\n\nThe French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, told parliament mothers were free to dress as they pleased and there was no need for new legislation on what should be worn on school trips. He said he would fight \u201cto defend secularism\u201d, which meant protecting people\u2019s religious freedoms.\n\nBut there are divisions within Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist La R\u00e9publique En Marche party.\n\nThe education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said last month he would rather avoid having mothers in hijab as volunteers on school outings. He said although he accepted mothers could legally wear what they pleased, \u201cthe headscarf itself is not desirable\u201d because of \u201cwhat it says about the status of women, what it says about our values\u201d.\n\nWhen one spokeswoman from Macron\u2019s party said she would support a rightwing proposal to ban mothers in headscarves attending school trips, others within the party replied with a #NotInMyName campaign against any ban.\n\nA senate committee is seeking to discuss potential legislation on mothers\u2019 dress codes later this month.\n\nThis week, 90 personalities, including actors and writers, signed an open letter in Le Monde calling for Macron to publicly condemn the request for the mother asked to remove her headscarf in the regional parliament.\n\nThey called for Macron \u201cto say with force that Muslim women, whether they wear a headscarf or not, and Muslims in general have a place in our society \u2013 and to refuse our fellow Muslim citizens being monitored, stigmatised or denounced for the practice of their religion\u201d.", "description": "Far-right politician sparks outrage by telling Muslim woman to remove hers on trip to parliament", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b812e1deb10020b7137c613fec7d1137c5a6315/0_281_5212_3127/master/5212.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4cc0603c9be5c8e68269fe33054f24b8", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
