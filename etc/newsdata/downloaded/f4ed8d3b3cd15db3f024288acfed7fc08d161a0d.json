We look back at history and ask: Will they do it again? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nConservative television network One America News is suing Rachel Maddow for more than $10 million for saying it \u201creally literally is paid Russian propaganda.\u201d\n\nThe network filed the federal defamation suit Monday in San Diego.\n\nIn the lawsuit obtained by USA TODAY, the network claims that Maddow\u2019s comments on her July 22 MSNBC show were \"utterly and completely false.\"\n\n\"OAN is wholly owned and financed by the Herrings, an American family. OAN has never been paid or received a penny from Russia or the Russian government,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nThe lawsuit also states that Maddow's comments were retaliation after OAN President Charles Herring accused cable television giant Comcast of censorship. The suit contends that Comcast refused to carry the channel because it \u201ccounters the liberal politics of Comcast\u2019s own news channel, MSNBC.\u201d\n\nA week after Herring sent an email to a Comcast executive, Maddow opened her MSNBC show by referring to a report in the Daily Beast that said an OAN employee also worked for Sputnik News, which is linked to the Russian government.\n\nMSNBC political commentator Rachel Maddow is pictured moderating a forum panel at the John F.

They are as American as apple pie. They are not paid by Russia and have nothing to do with the Russian government,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a false and malicious libel, and they\u2019re going to answer for it in a court of law.\u201d\n\nThe suit names Maddow, Comcast, MSNBC and NBCUniversal Media.\n\nThe lawsuit included an Aug. 6 letter from Amy Wolf, an attorney for NBCUniversal News Group, to OAN\u2019s attorney.\n\nIt said OAN \u201cpublishes content collected or created by a journalist who is also paid by the Russian government for writing over a thousand articles. Ms. Maddow\u2019s recounting of this arrangement is substantially true and therefore not actionable.\u201d\n\nThe statement also refers to Maddow's use of \"literally\" as a \"figure of speech.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to MSNBC for comment.\n\nOAN is a small, family-owned network based in San Diego that is challenging Fox News for conservative cable and satellite TV viewers and has received favorable tweets from President Donald Trump.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRachel Maddow says Trump's taxes are a drop of water to 'people dying of thirst'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/09/10/rachel-maddow-sued-one-america-news-russian-propaganda-remark/2272189001/", "description": "A conservative television network sued Rachel Maddow for more than $10 million on Monday for calling it \u201cpaid Russian propaganda.\u201d", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published A.M.
