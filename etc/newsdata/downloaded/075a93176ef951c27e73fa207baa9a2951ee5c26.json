Lawyers for Trump could not immediately be reached.\n\nVance had subpoenaed the returns and other records from Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA on Aug. 29 as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump sued Vance in Manhattan federal court to block the subpoena, arguing that a president was immune from criminal investigation while in office. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero heard arguments in the case on Wednesday but has yet to rule.\n\nMazars, also named as a defendant in Trump\u2019s lawsuit, said in a statement it would \u201crespect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.\u201d It said that as a matter of policy, it did not comment on its work for clients.\n\nThe scope of Vance\u2019s investigation is not publicly known.\n\nThe subpoena on Mazars came four weeks after Vance issued a separate subpoena to the Trump Organization for records of hush-money payments to two women prior to the 2016 presidential election. Adult-film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal have said they had sexual relationships with Trump, which he has denied.", "description": "New York prosecutors have agreed to put on hold their bid to enforce their subpoena seeking U.S. President Donald Trump's tax returns, according to a court filing on Thursday.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
