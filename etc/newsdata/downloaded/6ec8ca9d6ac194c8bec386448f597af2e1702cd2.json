Just 299 MPs voted for the motion, way short of the threshold of 434.\n\nHowever, despite the blow, Mr Corbyn is now in danger of being embarrassingly outflanked as the SNP and Lib Dems are considering getting behind a new piece of legislation triggering a pre-Christmas election.\n\nWhat happened in Parliament today? Boris Johnson, the SNP and the Lib Dems have been trying to put together an unlikely alliance to render Jeremy Corbyn powerless. In the face of a massive backbench revolt, Mr Corbyn blocked the PM's latest bid to force a snap poll tonight. That motion was brought under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, meaning two-thirds of the Commons must vote in favour for it to pass. But the veteran left-winger is at risk of being outflanked after the SNP and Lib Dems broke ranks. They have offered to back a one-line Bill that would sidestep the FTPA. In return the PM would give up hope of passing the Brexit Bill before an election. However, the date could be a major sticking point, as Mr Johnson wants December 12 and the other parties are demanding December 9.\n\nIn the wake of the defeat, Mr Johnson confirm that he will push the legislation - which only requires a simple majority to pass - in the morning.\n\nHe said the Bill would pave the way for an election on December 12, saying it is time to replace the 'dysfunctional Parliament' with one that can 'get Brexit done'.\n\nHowever, it is unclear if the bill will past because the date could be a major sticking point, as the other parties had been suggesting December 9.\n\nThe stage is now set for high-stakes bartering through the night to try to find a compromise.\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson said: 'Boris Johnson claims he wants a general election, but he also claimed he wouldn't prorogue Parliament or put a border down the Irish sea.\n\n'If Boris Johnson wants a General Election, then he could have supported our Bill for a General Election on December 9th. Instead, he has chosen to stick to his original plan for December 12th which we have already rejected.'\n\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford also suggested his MPs would press for the December 12 date.\n\nAnd he suggested he would need a 'cast-iron guarantee' that the Prime Minister would not try to bring back his Brexit deal to Parliament.\n\nBut it is understood No10 is determined to resist the earlier date as it would mean the Bill must be passed and get Royal Assent by the end of Thursday.\n\nThat is seen as 'very difficult', while there are also concerns that the Northern Ireland Budget Bill must go through before dissolution.\n\nAfter the vote this evening, Mr Johnson mocked Mr Corbyn for failing to stay in the chamber to hear the results.\n\n'The leader of the Opposition literally and figuratively has run away from the judgment of the people,' he said.\n\nMr Johnson continued: 'But as I said when moving the motion, we will not allow this paralysis to continue, and one way or another we must proceed straight to an election.\n\n'So later on this evening, the Government will give notice of presentation for a short Bill for an election on December 12 so we can finally get Brexit done.'\n\nHe added: 'This House cannot any longer keep this country hostage.'\n\nMr Corbyn later appeared and said: 'I apologise to you and to the Prime Minister for not being here at the point when he raised his point of order, I was detained outside the chamber, I'm now back here.'\n\nIn brutal clashes in the chamber before the vote, Mr Johnson insisted he no longer believed that Parliament could 'deliver Brexit' and must go to the country to break the deadlock.\n\n'I think the leader of the Opposition has now run out of excuses,' Mr Johnson said.\n\nOpening the snap election debate tonight, Boris Johnson said he did not want to put the public to the 'inconvenience' of a pre-Christmas election but Parliament could not 'deliver'\n\nMr Corbyn sat impassively as he was lambasted by the PM for cowardice during the debate\n\nA breakdown showing how MPs voted today. It shows that the Lib Dems opposed the vote, while the SNP and Labour abstained\n\nMr Johnson said the current Parliament had 'run its course'.\n\n'Across the country there is a widespread view that this Parliament has run its course,' he said.\n\nWhy is there a dispute over whether the election should be on December 9 or 12? The fate of Boris Johnson's second general election vote on Tuesday largely depends on whether he can come to a compromise with the SNP and Lib Dems over when the poll would be held. A full 25 working days is needed between Parliament dissolving and an election, so Number 10 insists a December 9 date isn't possible. However, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is worried Mr Johnson could use the later date to try and bring his Brexit Bill back and rush it through before polling day. The PM has rejected these concerns, saying the bill is dead until after an election. There has also been a suggestion that the Lib Dems and Labour would prefer an earlier poll because more students would be at university, potentially handing them an advantage. However, the fact is that many major universities finish for Christmas on Friday, December 13. Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill has warned that December 12 is the latest possible date for an election or it would mean Christmas events at village halls and schools being cancelled to make way for polling stations.\n\n'I simply do not believe that this House is capable of delivering on the priorities of the people, whether that means Brexit or anything else.'\n\nConservative former minister Robert Halfon intervened to ask the PM: 'In his preparations for a no-deal Brexit, can he make sure there's plenty of corn feed for the election chickens on the opposite benches?'\n\nMr Johnson said the point had been 'elegantly put'.\n\nThe manoeuvring came after Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, announced that Brussels had granted Britain a so-called 'flex-tension' until January 31.\n\nThat led to Mr Johnson finally conceding that his 'do or die' date of October 31 will be missed.\n\nFurious Labour Remainers accused the Lib Dems of 'playing for naked political advantage' and handing more advantage to Mr Johnson by 'blowing up' the so-called Remainer alliance.\n\nOne Tory MP told MailOnline that the smaller parties endorsing a snap election would leave Labour 'well and truly stuck'.\n\nUnder the terms of the extension granted by the EU, if MPs back Mr Johnson's Brexit deal in the coming weeks then the extension can be terminated early and the UK will split from Brussels.\n\nMr Johnson's Plan A was for MPs to back holding an election on December 12.\n\nIf MPs back the snap poll then Parliament would be given until November 6 to agree to the PM's deal - but the election would then go ahead regardless.\n\nWhat are the terms of the Brexit delay offered by the EU to the UK? Donald Tusk announced this morning that the EU had agreed to delay Brexit by up to three months to January 31, 2020. However, the extension will have flexibility built into it. That will mean that if Boris Johnson is able to get his Brexit deal agreed by parliament and then ratified by the European Parliament the extension will be terminated early. If he is able to get his Withdrawal Agreement finalised in November the UK is likely to leave the EU on December 1. If the Brexit deal is finalised in December then the UK will likely leave on January 1 and if it is not sorted until January then the UK will leave the day after the current extension on February 1. Should Mr Johnson fail to get his deal through then the extension will provide enough time for a general election to be held. The EU is also expected to insist as part of the extension package that the UK appoint a new European Commissioner for the duration of the extension.\n\nThe chances of the PM securing an election on his preferred date will hinge on whether Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party support it.\n\nMr Johnson will need the backing of two thirds of the Commons 434 MPs - to trigger the election but Mr Corbyn is expected to abstain on the motion.\n\nMr Corbyn previously said he would vote for an election once a No Deal Brexit had been ruled for the next few months, but the party has suggested in recent days that the government must rule out a disorderly departure at any point.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and the SNP put forward their own plan that would see an election held on December 9.\n\nThe government is believed to be haggling with the Lib Dems and SNP over pushing the date to December 10 or 11.\n\nBut crucially for the Lib Dems, the Brexit Bill will be shelved until after the national ballot. The legislation to implement Mr Johnson's deal received its second reading from MPs, but was then 'paused' after the House refused to sign off a breakneck 72-hour timetable to get it on the statute book.\n\nA senior government source was jubilant about the shift, saying it 'feels like we'll get there one way or another'.\n\nIndependent Group leader Anna Soubry raged that the Lib Dems had 'turned their backs' on a second referendum.\n\n'They have, in my view, turned their back on the People's Vote, wrongly claiming there is no majority for it in Parliament. I am sorry to say that old style, selfish, tribal party politics is at play,' she said.\n\nOne Remain-backing Labour MP told MailOnline: 'This is about naked political advantage... they are just blowing things up.'\n\nThe MP said they and anti-Brexit colleagues would still vote against the FTPA motion, but added gloomily: 'I've got to go - I've got a small majority and an election to prepare for.'\n\nThe decision by the EU to grant the UK a three month delay represents a humiliating moment for Mr Johnson who said he would rather be 'dead in a ditch' than see Brexit postponed again.\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson, pictured in the Commons tonight, has hatched a plan with the SNP to outflank Mr Corbyn if he blocks an election\n\nCommons speaker John Bercow addresses MPs during the debate over whether to call a general election\n\nThe European Council president Donald Tusk confirmed that the UK would get another three months to break its Brexit deadlock by either passing a deal or holding a general election\n\nMr Johnson's Brexit mastermind Dominic Cummings (right) arrives in Downing Street this morning before the EU granted the Brexit extension\n\nSenior ministers including Sajid Javid and leading Brexiteers like Steve Baker (right) were in Downing Street this morning\n\nEx-ministers Michael Fallon and James Brokenshire were also among MPs called in to Downing Street\n\nAnnouncing the extension, Mr Tusk said in a tweet: 'The EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK's request for a #Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020.\n\n'The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.'\n\nUnder the terms of the extension offered by the EU, the UK will be able to quit the bloc before January 31 if Parliament is able to agree to the PM's deal.\n\nThe extension is expected to include a termination clause so that if MPs back the deal in November the UK will leave the EU on December 1 and if they back the deal in December then the UK will leave the EU on January 1.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, said today: 'I'm very happy that a decision has been taken.'\n\nThe EU had been split on how long thew Brexit delay should be with French President Emmanuel Macron initially favouring a short extension.\n\nHowever, Mr Macron is believed to have changed his mind after a phone call with Mr Johnson yesterday.\n\nThe EU has long insisted that it would grant a lengthier delay if it was to make time for the UK to either hold an election or a second referendum.\n\nMr Johnson appears to have persuaded Mr Macron that a general election will dramatically alter the Brexit arithmetic in the House of Commons, finally providing a way through the current impasse.\n\nAn EU source said the extension would last 'only as long as necessary to allow for the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement and, in any event, no longer than January 31 2020'.\n\nBritain would be able to leave the EU on the first day of the month following the ratification of the WAB by both the European and UK parliaments.\n\nBut the source added: 'The United Kingdom will remain a member state until the new withdrawal date, with full rights and obligations, including the obligation to suggest a candidate for appointment as a member of the Commission.\n\n'This extension excludes any re-opening of the Withdrawal Agreement.'\n\nThe text will be submitted to the UK for agreement, before a written procedure is launched to adopt the decision - with the process likely to be concluded tomorrow or Wednesday.\n\nOne potential sticking point in the EU's extension offer is that the UK will likely be required to nominate and send a UK Commissioner after October 31.\n\nMr Johnson previously said Britain would stop sending one after October 31 \u2013 the day he said Brexit would happen.\n\nThe EU is also adamant that no major changes can be made to the Prime Minister's deal.\n\nIt says: 'The European Council firmly states that it excludes any reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement in the future and recalls that any unilateral commitment, statement or other act by the United Kingdom should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement.'\n\nMr Tusk has been in intensive discussions with EU leaders over the weekend.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, pictured today leaving his London home, is under growing pressure to back a pre-Christmas election\n\nA majority of Labour MPs are believed to be opposed to a pre-Brexit election.\n\nOne set out their opposition in colourful terms to the Politics Home website as they said: 'I won't be voting for a general election come hell or high water. They can go f*** themselves. Brexit must be sorted.\n\n'As for winning, you've got to be pretty dim to ask for the chequered flag when you're stuck at the back of the grid.'\n\nMany recent opinion polls have Labour trailing the Tories by double digits with senior party figures fearing the worse if there is an election in the near future.\n\nBut while many in Labour are downbeat on their chances at an election, the pro-Remain Lib Dems and SNP are champing at the bit to go to the country early.\n\nBoth believe a pre-Brexit election is in their favour, hence why they have joined forces on the plan to force a poll on December 9.\n\nThat is the absolute earliest an election could be held because of rules which dictate there must be 25 working days before polling day.\n\nThe December 9 date would be three days before the PM's proposed date and, crucially, when more students are still at university to cast their votes in Remain-supporting target swing seats.\n\nThe draft law, currently earmarked to be tabled tomorrow, would require a simple majority of 320 MPs to support it in order to dissolve Parliament - 114 fewer than under the FTPA 'super majority' rules.\n\nMs Swinson said the proposal would tie Mr Johnson's hands over the election date and would not give him the 'wriggle room' that his own plan would have.\n\nMany opposition MPs fear that if they voted for an election Mr Johnson could then change the date to force a No Deal Brexit - something Downing Street has long dismissed as nonsense.\n\n'And because people can't trust what this man says, I think setting that date in law is a very good idea,' Ms Swinson told the BBC' Radio 4 Today programme.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader said there were various reasons why December 9 made more sense than December 12 for an election.\n\n'Clearly, it's three further days away from Christmas and I understand that the public appetite for an election around Christmas is not necessarily high so I think, from the point of view of the economy and retailers, keeping it as far away as possible is helpful,' she said.\n\n'What waiting would do is risk No Deal, because if we waste this extension and we end up in January with that 31st of January deadline looming, assuming it is granted today, and we haven't done anything with this time, then there's no guarantee the EU will extend again and then no-deal is back on the table.'\n\nJohn McDonnell responded with fury to the prospect of the Lib Dems, SNP and Tories working together to force an early election\n\nThe prospect of the Lib Dems and SNP working with the Tories to force an early election sparked anger from Labour frontbenchers.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, tweeted: 'Looks like the Lib Dem and Tory pact of 2010 is being re-established.\n\n'They are back together, selling out the People's Vote campaign and the cross party campaign to prevent a no deal.\n\n'The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back.'\n\nLast night Labour frontbencher Lucy Powell told the Westminster Hour that an 'election soon is now both inevitable and necessary'.\n\nShe said: 'Parliament is in a deadlock and we need to break that deadlock somehow, even if Brexit is done.\n\n'The issue is the terms of that election, the when and how of that election. I think what we've seen from the Liberal Democrats and the SNP is trying to shape the terms of that election in a way that would favour them the most, it's pure playing of politics.'\n\nA No 10 source said: 'We are laying a one-clause motion to amend the FTPA and call an election with the named day of December 12.\n\n'The Bill is very similar to the Lib Dem-SNP Bill. The WAB will not be put back. This is the way to get Brexit done so the country can move on.'\n\nThe Brexit endgame: How the crisis might develop as Boris Johnson struggles to cut ties with EU\n\nThe Prime Minister has missed his 'do or die' Halloween Brexit deadline, which means the UK will stay in the EU until January 31 next year, unless Parliament ratifies his deal before then.\n\nWith that 'flextension' now confirmed by the EU, attention now turns to the matter of a general election.\n\nSo is it as straightforward as setting a date and getting on with it? Not quite. Here is a look at how things stand.\n\nWhat has the PM been trying to do and has he succeeded?\n\nMr Johnson made another election bid under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA), requiring a two-thirds Commons majority - 434 MPs - to have an election on December 12.\n\nBut Labour's lack of support for the proposal meant it was defeated.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has insisted that Labour can only support an election once the threat of a no-deal crash-out from the European Union has been completely ruled out.\n\nWhy is there opposition to an election on December 12?\n\nConcerns have been raised about a December election for a number of reasons - not all of them political.\n\nThere is talk of voters staying away, discouraged by cold wintry evenings, while others could well be booked up with office Christmas parties, nativity plays, shopping and generally busying themselves with festive fun.\n\nThere are also potential issues with councils being unable to book polling stations and count venues with such short notice.\n\nHas December 9 also been mentioned as a potential date?\n\nYes. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford have put forward a tightly-drafted Bill that would grant an election on December 9 - three days earlier than the PM's suggested polling date - as long as the European Union granted the January 31 extension.\n\nThe draft law, currently scheduled to be debated in Tuesday's sitting of the House of Commons, would require a simple majority of 320 MPs to support it in order to dissolve Parliament - 114 fewer than under the FTPA 'super majority' rules.\n\nWhat difference does three days make?\n\nMs Swinson said her proposal ties Mr Johnson's hands over the election date and does not give him the 'wriggle room' that his own plan would have.\n\nShe said it is three further days away from Christmas, adding that keeping the election day as far away from December 25 is in the best interest of the economy.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader also pointed out that December 9 would be a better date for university students who may be leaving university towns to return home for Christmas at the end of term.\n\nAre the Lib Dems and the SNP keen to have an election at the earliest possible opportunity?\n\nIt would seem so. Ms Swinson said December 9 is the earliest possible date to have an election if the Bill is passed, meaning that an election happens 'as soon as possible'.\n\nBoth the Lib Dems and the SNP would hope to benefit from an election before Brexit takes place because they will be hoping to win the backing of people who want Brexit scrapped.\n\nThe Lib Dems have campaigned for a People's Vote, while the SNP has also been vocal in its support of a second Brexit referendum.\n\nSo where does Labour stand on all of this?\n\nWhile some around Jeremy Corbyn back a snap election, many Labour MPs are bitterly opposed to a poll, fearing confusion over the party's position on Brexit will cost them at the ballot box.\n\nThe party has said it will only back an election if Mr Johnson makes 'absolutely clear' that no-deal is off the table now that the January extension has been granted.\n\nBut it is not entirely clear what steps Mr Johnson would have to take to satisfy Labour that no-deal has completely been ruled out.\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott suggested further legislation may be required as promises by Mr Johnson were 'not worth the paper they're written on'.\n\nShe said that Labour would 'discuss' the Lib Dems/SNP Bill with opposition colleagues.\n\nMr Corbyn had previously said he wanted to wait for the EU's decision over the length of the Article 50 extension before deciding whether to whip MPs in support of Mr Johnson's bid for a winter election.", "description": "Boris Johnson failed to secure the two-thirds majority in the Commons needed to trigger an early ballot under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/21/20298764-0-image-a-55_1572298830846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
