If you don\u2019t have a will or other estate plan, the laws of your state determine who gets the value in those accounts.\n\nYour digital assets are a different story. Your online photos and videos, frequent flyer miles, cryptocurrency and other digitally stored files may well disappear without a trace if you don\u2019t make a plan to pass them along.\n\nConversely, some stuff you may prefer to shut down or keep private \u2014 emails and texts, social media accounts, dating app profiles \u2014 could be shared or hacked unless you take steps to secure the information.\n\nMake a list\n\nEstate planning experts recommend creating an inventory of your online accounts and digital files, along with your login ID, passwords, the answers to any security questions and what type of two-factor authentication, if any, is in use. (Two-factor authentication is often a code that\u2019s texted or emailed to you or generated using a smartphone app.)\n\nStart with a list of your devices \u2014 smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers \u2014 and their passwords, along with passwords to any important apps (such as that code generator). Then inventory the other electronic records you use, own or control. Here are some categories to consider, along with some examples to jog your memory:\n\nDecide who gets what\n\nSome assets can\u2019t be passed down. When you buy a book or song online, for example, you\u2019re typically only buying a license that expires when you do, says Ray Radigan, head of private trust at TD Bank in New York. One workaround is to set up a family account that allows you to share your digital bounty now and after you die.\n\nMany travel providers also insist in their \u201cterms and conditions\u201d that rewards aren\u2019t your property, but their actual policies vary. Many airlines, for example, will transfer frequent flyer miles to the appropriate heirs, says Karin Prangley, senior vice president at financial services firm Brown Brothers Harriman in Chicago.\n\nSome companies, including Google and Facebook, allow you to designate someone to handle your account when you die. Others simply close or deactivate accounts when they learn of a death. Searching for the company name along with the phrase \u201cwhat happens to my account when I die\u201d can turn up its policies.\n\nOnce you decide what you want to happen with each type of account or digital asset, write down your wishes. You can leave these instructions and the relevant login credentials in a letter, stored with your other estate planning documents, that can be given to the person you want to carry out those wishes: your digital executor.\n\nAppoint your \u2018digital executor\u2019\n\nYour digital executor could be the same trusted person who settles the rest of your estate, or you might want to choose someone who is more tech-savvy. Talk to the person first to ensure they\u2019re willing and then let them know how to access the documents they\u2019ll need, says Jason Largey, senior estate planning strategist at Personal Capital in Denver.\n\nYour digital executor should be named in your will or living trust, estate planning experts say. Depending on state law, your attorney may need to add additional language to your documents to address the disposition of your digital assets.\n\nSet a date to review your plan\n\nTech evolves fast. Remember floppy disks and Myspace? If not, consider that 10 years ago, nobody had an iPad or an Instagram account. Meanwhile, biometrics, including fingerprint scans and facial recognition, are already replacing passwords and other login credentials.\n\nYour digital assets, and how you access them, are likely to change even faster than your financial and physical property, Prangley says. She makes it a point to review and update her digital estate plan annually, at the same time she\u2019s updating her passwords.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I do like spring cleaning, once a year,\u201d she says.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Photos and even cryptocurrency can disappear without a trace if you don\u2019t make a plan to pass them along.", "authors": ["Liz Weston"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ709_nerd_d_ZG_20190904174820.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
