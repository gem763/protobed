Bouee and Credit Suisse's head of global security services subsequently resigned.\n\nReports also emerged that a private investigator who organized the surveillance mission had committed suicide. Reuters reported that the investigator worked as a middleman between Switzerland's second-largest bank and the private security firm.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche following Credit Suisse's third-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Thiam read out a letter from the family of the contractor and expressed the bank's sadness and regret, adding that this event was \"what led to the resignation of individuals.\"\n\nThe letter stated: \"We do not know with absolute certainty what led him to believe he had no option but to take his own life. There are no guilty parties. He was an honest individual with a sense of integrity, and he is being mourned by those who loved him. We therefore ask that our privacy be respected at this difficult time.\"", "description": "The Credit Suisse CEO expressed the bank's sadness and regret, adding that this event was \"what led to the resignation of individuals.\"", "authors": ["Elliot Smith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104266429-GettyImages-481647022.jpg?v=1532563919", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
