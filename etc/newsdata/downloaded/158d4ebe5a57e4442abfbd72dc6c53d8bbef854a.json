Taking it, along with other health supplements every day, he said, had really improved his cholesterol. He shared that after six months, his levels\u2014particularly LDL\u2014were down significantly.\n\nHe went on to say that his excitement turned to concern when he read that if his cholesterol levels got too low it could have detrimental effects on his health. His concern stemmed from a study released a few months ago in the journal Neurology. In it, researchers concluded that extremely low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) could increase risk of hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nMore on that later\u2026 but I will admit, the topic of cholesterol is confusing. No wonder Steve is worried. For decades, cholesterol was considered one of the top cardiovascular villains\u2014and efforts were taken by doctors and cardiologists across the country to aggressively reduce LDL (otherwise known as \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d) in patients.\n\nBut now, research is starting to reveal that cholesterol isn\u2019t quite the bad guy the medical community has made it out to be. And, with this latest research, it looks like going too low could create a whole new set of problems. So, here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nStudy Details\n\nResearchers performed a prospective cohort study among 27,937 women enrolled in the Women\u2019s Health Study. (A prospective cohort study follows groups of people who are alike in many ways but differ by one characteristic.)\n\nThe researchers looked at the participants\u2019 total cholesterol, LDL, high density lipoprotein (HDL, otherwise known as \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d), and triglycerides. During 19 years of follow-up, 137 hemorrhagic strokes occurred. Compared with those people whose LDL levels were 100\u2013129.9 mg/dl, those with levels below 70 mg/dl had more than twice the risk of suffering this type of stroke. Interestingly, no significant increase in risk was observed for women whose levels were higher (130\u2013159.9 mg/dl) or in the normal range (70\u201399.9 mg/dl).1\n\nThis result is definitely alarming. However, there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, ischemic strokes, which occur when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is blocked or clogged, are far more common, accounting for 87 percent of all strokes. (And it should be noted, low cholesterol actually helps to prevent this type of stroke.) Hemorrhagic strokes\u2014what the study participants experienced\u2014are less prevalent, accounting for only 15 percent of strokes. They happen when a weakened blood vessel ruptures, causing bleeding in the brain.\n\nFurthermore, look at the stats: 137 strokes suffered among a total of nearly 28,000 women. That comes out to a half percent of the population\u2026over a 20-year period. When you look at it that way, it\u2019s a lot less concerning.\n\nSecond, only women were followed. It\u2019s hard to know if these same results translate to men. And finally, the study did not look at the effects of cholesterol-lowering therapies on stroke risk. Were the women who suffered strokes on statin drugs? Were those drugs lowering their levels too much? These are all important considerations that weren\u2019t accounted for.\n\nSo, I think the main takeaway from this study is that cholesterol levels that veer too far in either direction\u2014whether they\u2019re far too high or far too low\u2014can be problematic and increase risk of various health issues. The goal should be to keep levels as close to the normal range as possible.\n\nSupplements that Lower Cholesterol Levels\n\nIf your cholesterol is on the high side, getting it down to normal range doesn\u2019t have to be difficult\u2014and you can do it without taking statins. In fact, if high cholesterol is your one and only heart risk factor, you should definitely try natural methods first before turning to statins.\n\nSome of the best nutrients for cholesterol support are citrus bergamot and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).\n\nCoQ10 is an important antioxidant that fuels energy production in your cells\u2019 mitochondria\u2014which are responsible for up to 90 percent of the energy your cells need to stay alive.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nCoQ10 sparks the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the substance your body uses for energy. Of all the organs in your body, your heart relies on CoQ10 the most due to the extraordinary amount of energy it uses. This makes sense considering your heart is always beating and working hard to keep you alive. So, the higher the CoQ10 in your body, the more ATP the body can produce to fuel your heart.\n\nCoQ10 has been studied extensively for many heart-related issues. Studies have shown that it helps to lower LDL cholesterol, improve HDL cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease and heart attack, and protect the heart during a heart attack.\n\nIn one study, 150 mg of CoQ10 was given to 53 men every day for two weeks. It led to a significant 12.7 percent decrease in LDL.2\n\nThe typical therapeutic dose of CoQ10 (as ubiquinol) can be as high as 300 mg daily, taken in divided doses.\n\nNewport Natural Health offers an outstanding CoQ10 supplement CoQMax that doesn\u2019t just offer 100mg of CoQ10, but it uses a form called HydroQSorb\u00ae.\n\nHydroQSorb\u00ae has been shown to be 300% more absorbable than ordinary CoQ10\u2026 which means that 100mg of HydroQSorb\u00ae is like taking 300mg of regular CoQ10. And you\u2019ll also get 500mg of Cavacurmin, a powerful form of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory curcumin shown to be up to 40X more absorbable than ordinary curcumin.

It has been shown in many studies to reduce cholesterol levels.\n\nIn one such study, 77 patients took 1,000 mg daily for one month. Cholesterol dropped from an average of 278 mg/dl to 191.3\n\nThat\u2019s a 31% decrease in just 30 days!\n\nIn another study that looked at bergamot\u2019s effects on rats and 237 patients, supplementation for 30 days reduced total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and even blood glucose.4\n\nA good therapeutic dosage of bergamot is 500 mg daily. And you can get a proprietary, standardized form of bergamot, called Bergavit\u00ae, in Newport Natural Health\u2019s Cholesterol Solution. You can learn more about Cholesterol Solution here.\n\nIf You Have Very Low Cholesterol\n\nIf you have extremely low LDL and are concerned about your risk for hemorrhagic stroke, talk to your doctor. He/she will probably want to look at your other risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke, including hypertension, smoking, and blood vessel abnormalities. Being proactive about your health and reducing these and other risk factors can lessen your chances even more.\n\nReferences\n\n[MK1]Link to the store page for CoQMax\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
