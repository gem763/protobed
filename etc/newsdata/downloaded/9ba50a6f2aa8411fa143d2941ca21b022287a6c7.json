Men\u2019s and women\u2019s events will feature equal prize money ranging from $25,000 to $108,000 per tournament.\n\nOracle said the new initiative will boost professional playing opportunities for U.S. players by more than 40 percent, with top performers earning improved pro rankings and access to more prestigious international events on the ATP and WTA tours. The circuit aims to boost career prospects and provide a training ground for top juniors and college players who would have otherwise fell short of the pros.\n\n\u201cThese events help develop American talent and serve as a stepping stone for players to reach the highest levels of the game, while at the same time inspire kids across the nation to pick up a racket and play this sport,\u201d US Tennis Association CEO Stacey Allaster said in a statement.\n\nThe Oracle Pro Series is set to be managed by American tennis great and former top-ranked player Jim Courier and his firm, InsideOut Sports & Entertainment. Play begins on Oct. 6 at the Claremont Club in Los Angeles, with further events planned in California, Texas and Florida.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Oracle Pro Series is an unprecedented expansion in the number of U.S. professional tournaments and reinforces Oracle\u2019s commitment to advancing the sport,\u201d Courier said. \u201cWe are thrilled to be partnering with Oracle to give up-and-coming players more opportunities to compete for prize money, improve their rankings and launch their careers. Together, we will play a big part influencing the future of tennis in the U.S.\u201d\n\nTop junior tennis players face a tough path to the pro tour, with parents regularly paying more than $50,000 to enroll their kids at private tennis academies. Players who parlay their tennis skills into college scholarships often see their careers come to an end after senior year.\n\nOnly a \u201cvery, very low percentage\u201d of junior players proceed to professional careers, with fewer still managing steady success, according to Mark Bowtell, associate director of the John McEnroe Tennis Academy in New York.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cThe statistics say it all, for the most part,\u201d Bowtell said. \u201cFor example, if you then look at how many [American women] are in the under-18 hard court national event, there\u2019s probably about 256, and that would actually exclude some people who didn\u2019t even make the cut. That\u2019s just one particular age group. So they\u2019d be lucky if one person from that set age group made it into the top 10 or top 20 [on the pro tour].\u201d", "description": "Men\u2019s and women\u2019s events will feature equal prize money ranging from $25,000 to $108,000 per tournament.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/tennis-balls.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
