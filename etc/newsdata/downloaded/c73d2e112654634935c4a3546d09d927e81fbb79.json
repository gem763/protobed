The ongoing tsunami of discontent washes over this island, which, like Hong Kong, is navigating the choppy waters of relations with the same large and menacing mainland neighbor. This nation \u2014 which is such psychologically, if not in diplomatic nomenclature \u2014 has a presidential election in January that seems certain to be influenced by alarm about Hong Kong\u2019s current unhappy experience with the legalistic fudge of \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d which the incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, rejects.\n\nHong Kong is officially, if with increasing resentment, a \u201cspecial administrative region\u201d of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan is, officially and with varying degrees of pugnacity, the independent \u2014 and determined to stay that way \u2014 Republic of China (ROC). This is a reality the PRC denies with fluctuating, but currently intensifying, truculence.\n\nThe increase probably derives from the PRC\u2019s decreasing economic vigor. The regime, meaning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has presented this nonnegotiable bargain to Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million subjects: You will be obedient, and we will make you prosperous. Now, however, prosperity is becoming attenuated, partly because of the inevitable corruption that riddles thoroughly politicized economies, where every decision is political; partly because any government-\u201cmanaged\u201d economy will be badly managed; and partly because of the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nEssentially no one here believes the PRC\u2019s economic statistics, which claim that China\u2019s growth has slowed but only to a still-brisk 6 percent rate. Officials here think the real rate could be 3 percent or even negative. And they discern an inverse relationship between the PRC\u2019s economic vigor and the regime\u2019s resort to bellicose nationalism to rally or distract the nation. So, Beijing presents Hong Kong\u2019s demonstrations against Beijing\u2019s encroachments on established liberties as an attempt to dismember China.\n\nThis year, which has featured PRC pressure to \u201cmainlandize\u201d Hong Kong, began for Taiwan with a Jan. 2 speech in which PRC President Xi Jinping impudently addressed his supposed \u201cTaiwan compatriots,\u201d who feel less like such because of Hong Kong events, among other reasons. Xi said, \u201cChinese do not fight Chinese.\u201d They do, however, kidnap and torture them.\n\nIt is commonly but carelessly said that Xi is \u201cpresident for life.\u201d Actually, although he got the two-term limit on PRC presidents removed, and although he holds other powerful offices, he still must be reelected by the small constituency of the upper reaches of the CCP. Xi seems obsessed, as the weak often are, with projecting strength. He has, however, many enemies from his anti-corruption campaign and has rising economic dissatisfaction, so he has an incentive to harp on China\u2019s \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d \u2014 from the start of the First Opium War in 1839 to Mao Zedong\u2019s 1949 victory in China\u2019s civil war.\n\nIt ended with Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s losing forces driven to this island, then known as Formosa, a colony of Japan for the 50 years before the end of World War II. Here Chiang ruled as dictator through his political arm, the Kuomintang (KMT), until his death in 1975. Democracy began to be established in 1987, after one of the world\u2019s longest periods of martial law. Today, the KMT\u2019s presidential candidate, Han Kuo-yu, is a populist who \u2014 go figure \u2014 favors more Beijing-friendly policies. Terry Gou, founder of the gigantic Foxconn, one of Apple\u2019s principal suppliers, has, for now, opted not to run, perhaps because of gigantic conflicts of interest: With more than 1 million employees in the PRC, Foxconn is the largest private-sector employer there. He illustrates the extent to which Taiwan and the PRC are economically melded: About 30 percent of Taiwan\u2019s exports go to the PRC, where per capita income is about one-third that of Taiwan; roughly half a million Taiwanese work in the PRC.\n\nTaiwan lives with a condition Hong Kong does not have: 1,500 PRC missiles pointed at it. Xi has said Taiwan\u2019s unification with the PRC is \u201cthe great trend of history.\u201d Taiwan, however, represents resistance to two supposed historical inevitabilities.\n\nDuring the Cold War, \u201cFinlandization\u201d denoted the process by which a small, civilized nation could be compelled to accommodate a large, coarse one. The fact of Taiwan refutes the theory that such accommodation is inevitable. And it also refutes the theory that democracy must bring the kind of disorder that has come to Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nPeople here are jauntily amused that a recent film adaptation of Winnie the Pooh, along with images of the famous cartoon bear, were blocked by Xi\u2019s censors because people have noted a resemblance of the bear\u2019s face to Xi\u2019s. Some strongman.\n\nRead more from George F.
