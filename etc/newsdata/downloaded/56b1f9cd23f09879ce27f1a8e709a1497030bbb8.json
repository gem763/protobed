Again.\n\nSanchez, now 20, was arrested Thursday after her failure to yield prompted a police pursuit, the Stockton Police Department said in a statement. Sanchez fled patrol cars but crashed near a highway on-ramp. A male passenger ran from the scene and escaped, police said.\n\n\u201cThe arresting officers saw she was on parole and was driving on a revoked driver\u2019s license,\u201d Officer Joe Silva, a department spokesman, told the Associated Press.\n\nOfficers also found a loaded .45-caliber pistol in the car, the department said, leading to charges related to weapons, traffic violations and a parole violation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA state corrections spokesperson said Sanchez was released early after earning credit for good behavior and attending rehabilitation programs, along with time served ahead of her sentence, the AP reported.\n\nThe 2017 crash shocked the world with its brutal immediacy. Sanchez\u2019s hands left the wheel in a video she recorded before she swerved and overcorrected, sending her Buick into a violent tumble. Her 14-year-old sister Jacqueline was thrown from the vehicle.\n\n\u201cI f---ing killed my sister, okay? I know I\u2019m going to jail for life, all right?\u201d Sanchez told her sister, who appeared to be already dead. \u201cI\u2019m-a hold it down. I love you, rest in peace, sweetie.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSanchez later tested positive for alcohol and cocaine. Another teenage girl in the back seat was injured in the crash.\n\nAfter the crash, Sanchez sought to explain why she live-streamed the gruesome scene.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI made that video because I knew I had more than 5,000 followers. It was the only way my sister would get a decent burial,\u201d she said in a letter to local media. \u201cI would never expose my sister like that. I anticipated the public donating money because my family isn\u2019t rich.\u201d\n\nHer father sympathized with her predicament. To a point.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is [Obdulia] knows she\u2019s done something wrong,\u201d Nicandro Sanchez told ABC affiliate KFSN in 2017. \u201cBecause she knows, and that\u2019s what I feel. She feels bad for herself, but she killed her own sister.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Obdulia Sanchez crashed during a police pursuit while on parole, two years after her livestream of a crash shocked the world with its brutal immediacy.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hJCpR5LzkrnCWCoMuyUvHhTeDho=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XZ5Y65HDA4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
