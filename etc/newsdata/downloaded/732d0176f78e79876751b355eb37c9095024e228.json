Should two attempts to confirm a prime minister fail in row, an early election may have to be called.\n\nOrban -- who has no relation to Prime Minister Viktor Orban in neighboring Hungary -- will attempt to rally a fractured group of parties. Even if he does, it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll be able to muster a reliable parliamentary majority and he may be forced to lead a minority cabinet until general elections slated for next year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a political crisis and I urge politicians to consider that and quickly reach a solution that will benefit all Romanians,\u201d Iohannis said in a televised speech from Bucharest. \u201cIt will be very difficult to negotiate support for complex laws in the current parliament.\u201d\n\nFormer Prime Minister Victor Ponta, one of the opposition leaders who helped Orban topple outgoing the government Viorica Dancila, has already said his lawmakers won\u2019t support a liberal government.
