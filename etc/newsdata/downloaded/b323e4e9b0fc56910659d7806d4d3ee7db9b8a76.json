They fell 21% in August after poorer-than-expected quarterly results.\n\nLabelled \u201cinsuretech\u201d, Assurance and peers such as California-based Health IQ and Clover Health have drawn eyes over the past year with disruptive models that use data crunching and artificial intelligence to boost revenue and cut costs.\n\nAndrew Sullivan, who heads Prudential\u2019s retirement and group insurance businesses, said in a call with analysts that Assurance brought with it 17 million customers in need of insurance.\n\n\u201cWe know that there are large middle market and mass affluent customer segments that have been traditionally underserved.\u201d\n\nAssurance will add a new earning stream to Prudential that is not sensitive to equity markets, interest rates and credit, he said.\n\nThe deal is part of a broader trend of large insurers increasingly betting big on new-age, Silicon Valley startups that are starting to disrupt the traditional insurance space.\n\nMarquee tech investors SoftBank Group Corp and Andreessen Horowitz have poured large amounts of capital into insuretech over the past 12-18 months, expecting valuations to surge as interest from the sector\u2019s big players grows.\n\nHealth IQ, which started selling policies in 2016, raised $55 million from Andreessen Horowitz and other investors earlier this year, valuing it at $450 million.\n\nAssurance uses data science and machine learning to speed up the application process and sells health, life, Medigap, home, and auto policies from more than 20 providers.\n\n\u201cThe consumer wants to be met not through a financial advisor but online through a portal,\u201d said Sandler O\u2019Neill analyst John Barnidge in a note.\n\nAssurance will continue to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential under existing CEO Michael Rowell and the deal value will rise by another $1.15 billion in additional cash and equity based on growth targets. (reut.rs/2kwiqNd)\n\nPrudential expects the deal to generate cost savings of $25 million to $50 million in 2020, and $50 million to $100 million by 2022, adding 10 cents per share to the company\u2019s earnings by 2020, and between 30 cents and 35 cents in 2021.\n\nIt plans to use a combination of cash, debt, and equity financing to fund the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter. In a separate announcement, Prudential said it was increasing the company\u2019s share repurchase authorization for 2019 by $500 million to $2.5 billion.", "description": "Prudential Financial Inc is set to buy online insurance startup Assurance IQ Inc for $2.35 billion, the latest in a series of moves by traditional insurers to up investment in technology and data crunching by buying Silicon Valley startups.", "authors": ["Bharath Manjeshr", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
