Unconstrained by consultants, unconcerned about reelection, he is thinking about things such as legacy, and inheritance, and the grand sweep of history. Here, in the twilight of his career, he seems to sense\u2014in a way that eludes many of his colleagues\u2014that he\u2019ll be remembered for what he does in this combustible moment. \u201cI do think people will view this as an inflection point in American history,\u201d Romney tells me\u2026\n\nWhen I met him in his office a couple of weeks later, I asked if the Twitter insults bothered him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what he does,\u201d Romney said with a shrug, and then got up to retrieve an iPad from his desk.
