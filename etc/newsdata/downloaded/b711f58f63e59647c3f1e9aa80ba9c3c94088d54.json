Just listen and act on the current best available science,\u201d she said.\n\nThunberg generated headlines around the world earlier this week with her viral so-called \u201cHow Dare You?\u201d speech at the UN climate summit, accusing world leaders of betraying her generation.\n\nThe teen has inspired millions of youths, drawn to her cause by her passion and a mature, committed rhetorical style that belies her young age.\n\nGreta Thunberg turns tables on Trump and quotes his mockery in new Twitter bio Read more\n\nShe has also drawn mockery from some, including Donald Trump, who tweeted sarcastically that \u201cshe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future\u201d.\n\nWithout naming the US president, Thunberg said she didn\u2019t \u201cunderstand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become too loud for people to handle so people want to silence us \u2026 We should also take that as a compliment.\u201d\n\nTrudeau and other Canadian party leaders took a breather from a tight election campaign to join Thunberg at the Montreal rally \u2013 along with around 500,000 protesters, according to organizers.\n\nWalking with his wife and children, Trudeau mingled with a boisterous crowd that brandished placards reading \u201cRespect Mother Earth\u201d and \u201cMake America Greta Again\u201d \u2013 a riff on a campaign slogan popularized by Trump, a noted climate change skeptic.\n\nOne man was tackled by security when he appeared to lunge at the prime minister, while 13-year-old Annabelle Vellend broke out in tears when she spotted Thunberg, telling AFP: \u201cI really believe in Greta\u2019s movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is doing amazing things and it\u2019s great that she\u2019s able to press politicians to act on climate change, during an election,\u201d she said.\n\nPlay Video 2:06 Greta Thunberg: the speeches that helped spark a climate movement \u2013 video\n\nIn his first term, Trudeau cast himself as a champion in the fight against global warming, but his green image was tarnished by his nationalization of an oil pipeline to salvage the construction project after years of delay.\n\nThe prime minister said after meeting Thunberg and pledging to fund the planting of 2bn trees: \u201cI agree with her entirely. We need to do more.\u201d\n\nTrudeau's environmental record on the line in Canada election year Read more\n\nEarlier this week, the Liberal leader vowed that Canada would reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, joining 66 other countries that have already signed on to the pledge.\n\nLast Friday, more than 4 million youths \u2013 and adults \u2013 rallied in \u201cclimate strikes\u201d around the world.\n\nTurnout at events a week on was smaller, but still vocal.
