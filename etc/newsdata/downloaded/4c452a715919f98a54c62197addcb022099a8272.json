Gavin Newsom (D) (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening to withhold highway funding from California if it doesn't clean up its air quality. But California leaders are firing back, hard \u2014 and accusing the federal government of actually preventing it from cleaning up its pollution.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be intimidated by this brazen political stunt,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a defiant statement after the Environmental Protection Agency threat.\n\nCalifornia leaders are angry that the Trump administration took away California's authority to curb greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles last week \u2014 which they have repeatedly argued would also help it clean up lung-choking smog in the state.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t go back to the days when our air was the color of mud,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe won\u2019t relive entire summers when spending time outside amounted to a public health risk.\u201d\n\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler's letter was made public as California leaders were mounting an offensive against President Trump for his loss of leadership on climate change at this week's United Nations climate summit. They seized on the high-profile forum to show they were the true leaders on environmental issues.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell happened to this country that we have a president that we do today on this issue,\u201d Newsom (D) said to applause in New York, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a damn shame. It really is. I\u2019m not a little embarrassed about it \u2014 I\u2019m absolutely humiliated by what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nNewsom was also quick to insist the threat against his left-leaning state was based in pure politics. Wheeler's letter to the California Air Resources Board said the state \u201chas failed to carry out its most basic tasks under the Clean Air Act\u201d and could risk losing federal money, as Juliet Eilperin and I reported Tuesday, the state is not alone in its struggles.\n\nIt's true that some 40 counties in California do not meet federal air quality standards. California\u2019s mountain ranges form cauldron-like basins in which smog brews. And the high-sky number of people who live in the state, along with the many cars they drive, don\u2019t help.\n\nBut about three dozen other states not targeted with EPA letters also have counties that did not meet standards for six pollutants as of the end of August. And the California Air Resources Board said the federal government isn\u2019t helping it fight pollution from one of its biggest sources there: cars.\n\n\u201cThis letter appeared only days after EPA attacked our state authority on cars, increasing air pollution while at the same time limiting our ability to reduce it,\u201d CARB Executive Officer Richard Corey said in a statement responding to Wheeler\u2019s letter.\n\nSpeaking in New York on Tuesday following the U.N. climate summit, Newsom suggested that California is doing more than most states to curb pollution. \u201cWe're not asserting a paradigm, we're proving it,\u201d he said of creating jobs in green industries. \u201cThat paradigm is now challenged by an EPA that\u2019s been weaponized by the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s predecessor as governor, Jerry Brown, attended the climate summit, too, using it to launch an initiative with a geopolitical rival, China, which is now quarreling with the Trump administration over trade.\n\nThe California-China Climate Institute, based at Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University and the University of California at Berkeley, will tackle climate problems both technological and political. Brown founded it with China\u2019s most senior and veteran climate policy official, Xie Zhenhua. The Chinese province of Guangzhou will also participate.\n\nBrown acknowledged in an interview with The Post last week he was forming the partnership at a time of deep distrust of China amid the trade war. But he said it made sense \u201cbecause of California\u2019s unique role in enforcing clean air laws, we\u2019ve developed expertise, engineers, lawyers, technicians.\u201d\n\nThe partnership is especially striking given Trump's ongoing feuds with California on tackling pollution.\n\nTrump \u201ccomes along, denies climate change and wants to stop the state that\u2019s doing the most about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes no sense. I have to say that borders on the criminal.\u201d\n\nCarol Morello and Steven Mufson contributed reporting.\n\nRead more here:\n\nClimate and Environment Trump officials threaten to withhold highway funding from California for its \u2018chronic air quality problems\u2019 Trump administration officials threatened Tuesday to withhold federal highway funds from California, arguing that it had failed to show what steps it's taking to improve its air quality. The move by the Environmental Protection Agency escalates the fierce battle between President Trump and the left-leaning state.

(Matt McClain)\n\n\u2014 The latest sobering climate report: Climate change is already having a major impact on the world\u2019s oceans and frozen regions, according to a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And the report, compiled with the help of 100 scientists from around the world, warned that if global warming is left unchecked, the impacts thus far are only a sign of catastrophic consequences still to come, The Post\u2019s Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report.\n\nGiven current emissions levels, a number of serious impacts are essentially unavoidable:\n\nRising greenhouse gas emissions have already fueled monster storms, deadly heat waves, record sea ice loss and harm to coral reefs.\n\nBy 2050, extreme floods that usually hit coastal cities and small island nations every 100 years will become a yearly occurrence.\n\nBy the end of the century, the world could see a total sea level rise of 3.6 feet. That\u2019s higher than the IPCC estimate in 2013, when the group said the rise would be just over three feet.\n\nBy the year 2100, marine heat waves \u2013 blamed for killing corals and other critical ocean organisms \u2013 could become 20 times more common in a best-case scenario and 50 times more common in the worst case.\n\nEnvironmental activist Greta Thunberg addresses the Climate Action Summit at U.N. headquarters.

Trump tweeted a news story about Thunberg\u2019s impassioned remarks to United Nations leaders, saying: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d Later, Thunberg adjusted her profile to say just that: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

What Democrats said: Before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) pointed to previous Interior Department officials, including former secretary Ryan Zinke, who have been the focus of ethical investigations. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the Interior Department sorely needs transparency.\" And Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who called on the agency\u2019s watchdog to expand its investigation of the FOIA policy to include Jorjani, urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) not to \u201cignore the serous allegations facing this nominee.\u201d\n\nSmoke rises from the Colstrip Steam Electric Station in Colstrip, Mont.

More than 20 multinationals pledged to get 100 percent of their electricity from renewables, The Post\u2019s Steven Mufson reports, \u201cbringing to 300 the number of renewable commitments from companies with $5.5 trillion in revenue, according to the Climate Group.\u201d Other companies pledged to electrify their vehicle fleets, 10 companies committed to accelerating energy efficiency by 3 percent a year and another company said it would more than double its renewable energy purchases to more than 1.5 gigawatts of wind and solar.\n\nAn African elephant on the Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya.

The preliminary injunction stops the agency from pushing ahead with its 15-year plan to log 40,000 acres of the forest.
