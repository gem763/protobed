(Zack Wittman)\n\nResponding to ubiquitous online marketing by stem cell clinics selling unapproved treatments for everything from achy joints to Alzheimer\u2019s, Google announced Friday it will no longer accept ads for \u201cunproven or experimental medical techniques,\u201d including most stem cell therapy, cellular therapy and gene therapy.\n\nThe Internet giant said it was taking the step after seeing \u201ca rise in bad actors\u201d trying to take advantage of patients by offering \u201cuntested, deceptive treatments.\u201d Often, Google said in a post explaining the new policy, \u201cthese treatments can lead to dangerous health outcomes and we feel they have no place on our platforms.\u201d Its new policy will prohibit ads for treatments that have \u201cno established biomedical or scientific basis.\u201d\n\nThe new position comes as stem cell clinics have grown into a sprawling direct-to-consumer industry. Some clinics have told patients their treatments can help them with ailments such as macular degeneration, ALS, multiple sclerosis and degenerative lung diseases. Scientists and medical associations have likened the procedures to modern snake oil and accused the purveyors of preying on the hopes of seriously ill patients. The untested treatments, many researchers say, is imperiling patients and the reputation of a promising field.\n\nAfter years of little enforcement, the federal regulators have begun to crack down on the clinics. And the new Google policy will add to the growing scrutiny and pressure, industry experts said.\n\nWhen asked by The Washington Post last December about its policies about advertising by stem cell clinics, Google declined to answer questions about actions against specific companies. In a statement, the company said: \u201cIf we find ads that violate our policies, we take immediate action, which can include taking down violating ads or suspending an account altogether.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the company said its existing policies already prohibited marketing potentially dangerous and fraudulent health products \u2014 a stance some stem cell experts criticized as insufficient.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s new policy banning advertising for speculative medicines is a much-needed and welcome step to curb the marketing of unscrupulous medical products,\u201d said Deepak Srivastava, president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, a leading group of scientists that gave Google advice on the policy. \u201cThe premature marketing and commercialization of unproven stem cell products threatens public health, the confidence in biomedical research, and undermines the development of legitimate new therapies,\u201d he said.\n\nSome treatments have resulted in severe injuries, including at least five women who were blinded after stem cell clinics injected its product into their eyes.\n\nStem cell clinics say they are offering treatment to patients who have few other options and that their treatment may have ways of helping patients that science can\u2019t yet explain.\n\nSome industry representatives criticized Google\u2019s new ad policy on Friday. The ban on ads will unfairly devastate \u201cgood\u201d companies along with \u201cbad actors\u201d without discriminating which ones are trying to treat patients safely and follow evolving FDA regulations, said Andrew Ittleman, a Miami lawyer who represents several stem cell clinics.\n\nIn the past two years, Google had already begun refusing ads from several stem cell companies on a case-by-case basis, said Ittleman, who has been hired by a few such companies to try, unsuccessfully, to appeal such decisions with Google.\n\n\u201cIt puts Google in the position of being a quasi regulator, taking on quite a significant amount of jurisdiction,\u201d Ittleman said. \u201cThey\u2019re painting the industry with a broad brush and companies with legitimate arguments are going to be collateral damage.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s new ad policy, however, is unlikely to put the industry out of business. Many clinics have shown an ability to adapt nimbly to new regulatory rules and changes such as Google\u2019s ad policy.\n\n\u201cThis kind of ad ban hits hard because most companies rely on Google for a large share of their quality sales leads,\u201d said a former marketing head for a Florida stem cell company. \u201cBut there are plenty of other channels you can switch to \u2014 Facebook, Bing, Yahoo.\"\n\nThe marketing executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, said \u201cThese kinds of businesses are pretty savvy and have had to adapt a lot already. Many have previously been kicked off Google already. You learn to pivot and be resourceful.\u201d\n\nAnother recent example of the industry\u2019s ability to adapt, experts note, came when the Food and Drug Administration won a landmark lawsuit in June against a stem cell company selling stem cell procedures that extract clients\u2019 fat tissue, spin it to isolate certain cells, and inject them back into the body.\n\nHealth officials hailed the case as a turning point in the government\u2019s struggle to regulate the booming industry. But ahead of the legal victory, the industry had already begun to shift. Because the FDA was focusing on fat-based treatments, many clinics switched to treatments derived instead from s blood, bone marrow and birth-related tissues, such as amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood.\n\nGoogle officials said Friday they would continue to accept ads for clinical trials cleared by the government. It said that while important medical discoveries often start as unproven ideas, \u201cwe believe that monitored, regulated clinical trials are the most reliable way to test and prove important medical advances.\"\n\nThe ban will take effect across Google\u2019s ad services, including YouTube and ads Google helps place on third-party websites. And the ban includes treatments that are rooted in scientific findings and preliminary clinical experience \u201cbut currently have insufficient formal clinical testing\u201d to justify widespread use. The new policy, which will take effect in October, was detailed in a blog post by Adrienne Biddings, the company\u2019s policy adviser.\n\nThe post said that the \u201cdigital ads ecosystem can only flourish if it\u2019s a place that is safe and trustworthy for users.\u201d The company said it will use a combination of machine learning and human review to enforce it.\n\nTo formulate the new approach, a spokeswoman said, the company\u2019s policy team has reviewed the literature on the field and worked with various stem-cell experts.\n\nPaul Knoepfler, a stem cell biologist at the University of California at Davis and longtime critic of the for-profit stem cell industry, called the new Google policy a big deal. Many patients who have been seriously harmed, he noted, were initially recruited as customers via Google ads.\n\n\u201cA number of us have pushed for this kind of policy over the years so this news is a welcome surprise,\u201d Knoepfler said.\n\nRead more:\n\nMiracle cures or modern quackery?
