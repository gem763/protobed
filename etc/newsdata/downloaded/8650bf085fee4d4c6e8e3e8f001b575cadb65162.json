Read more\n\nIt is hoped in Brussels that Johnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, will further pursue a Northern Ireland-only backstop during meetings with the European commission\u2019s Brexit taskforce on Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe newly nominated EU commissioner for trade, Phil Hogan, a former Irish minister, told the Irish Times he believed the \u201cpenny is finally dropping\u201d in Johnson\u2019s government over the lack of alternatives.\n\nThe idea was originally rejected by May on the grounds it was unpalatable to her partners in the Democratic Unionist party, on which she relied for her working majority. At the time, she said \u201cno British prime minister\u201d could accept a regulatory border being drawn in the Irish Sea.\n\nNo 10 insisted on Tuesday that Johnson was not pursuing the idea again in the hope of winning the support of more hardline Eurosceptics. \u201cWe are not seeking a Northern Ireland-only backstop,\u201d a No 10 spokesman said.\n\nHowever, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, was sufficiently alarmed to demand a private meeting with Johnson in Downing Street on Tuesday evening, which lasted an hour.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Foster said: \u201cThe prime minister rejected a Northern Ireland-only backstop in a letter to Donald Tusk on 19 August. It is undemocratic and unconstitutional and would place a tariff border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. That would be unacceptable.\n\n\u201cDuring today\u2019s meeting, the prime minister confirmed his rejection of the Northern Ireland-only backstop and his commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland.\u201d\n\nHogan later told RT\u00c9 News that constitutional issues in the withdrawal agreement that concerned the DUP could be \u201cimproved\u201d, suggesting space could be opening up for a deal that might win the party\u2019s approval.\n\nJohnson has not been specific about how he will get a new deal with Brussels, but before his meeting with Foster, he said \u201cthere is a way\u201d to achieve one \u201cbut it will take a lot of hard work\u201d, as he fought back against accusations that his five-week prorogation of parliament is anti-democratic. \u201cDonnez-moi un break \u2013 what a load of nonsense,\u201d he said, switching to Franglais.\n\nThe prime minister has said he wants to remove the Irish backstop from the withdrawal agreement as it would tie Northern Ireland into the single market and the whole of the UK into a shared customs territory with the EU. He has described the arrangement as \u201cundemocratic\u201d and railed against signing a treaty that he says would be \u201cinconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK\u201d.\n\nBut his proposal in recent days of a single all-Ireland agrifood zone has offered some hope in Brussels that the government may return to the initial EU suggestion of an arrangement that solely keeps Northern Ireland within the EU\u2019s structures.\n\nHogan said Johnson, who visited the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, in Dublin on Monday, had offered some grounds for optimism in his recent talks.\n\n\u201cMr Johnson has made a proposal in the last few days talking about an all-Ireland food zone. That is certainly a clear indication of divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland/the EU and the rest of the UK,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that this has been spoken about by a British prime minister where they are prepared to accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. If we can build on that, we certainly might get closer to one another in terms of a possible outcome.\u201d\n\nHogan warned, however, that the single agrifood zone was some distance from a solution to the Brexit impasse. \u201cIt would have to include all goods \u2026 in terms of any agreement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions that can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage, albeit at the 11th hour, that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK. The taoiseach has indicated in the last 24 hours that the Northern Ireland-only backstop is quite an interesting idea to revisit.\u201d\n\nFabian Zuleeg, the chief executive of the European Policy Centre thinktank in Brussels, said the only point of the talks in Brussels would be to discuss an extension of article 50 beyond 31 October or the detail of a Northern Ireland-only arrangement.\n\n\u201cBut in reality I don\u2019t believe that the UK government wants to go down this route,\u201d he said. \u201cSo at the moment I don\u2019t see anything of substance that is being discussed because nothing else can be opened.\u201d\n\nAfter his nomination on Tuesday by the European commission\u2019s president-designate, Ursula von der Leyen, Hogan is to take over any trade talks with the UK once the country leaves the bloc, with the former deputy chief EU negotiator Sabine Weyand as his director general.\n\nHogan said the establishment of a new negotiating team \u201cwill take probably six to eight months once we know what the outcome of the present negotiations are \u2026 Then I expect it will take a number of years before we conclude the negotiations.\u201d", "description": "EU trade commissioner says he believes \u2018penny is finally dropping\u2019 for Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09df4477518acebd9ae8465404817704e1a337d7/116_171_2878_1726/master/2878.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fd39b91f02e430bca3aba0666922bcd", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
