His neighbor, a farmer, says the land belonged to his ancestors and has been stolen. One is an Israeli settler, the other a Palestinian living across the road.\n\nAn aerial view shows the Israeli settlement of Ofra in the occupied West Bank as seen in 1997 and obtained by Reuters from \"Peace Now\" on June 3, 2019. Peace Now/Handout via REUTERS\n\nIsrael\u2019s settlements in the occupied West Bank are one of the most heated issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians want the area, captured by Israel in a 1967 war, for a future state.\n\nIsrael has built more than 120 settlements there, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in the run-up to a Sept. 17 election, has renewed his pledge to annex them, alarming the Palestinians.\n\nMost of the international community sees the settlements as illegal and major obstacles to Israeli-Palestinian peace, a view Israel disputes.\n\nMichael Netzer moved to Ofra in 1985, about a decade after the settlement was established, one of Israel\u2019s first in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to say that Jews can\u2019t live here,\u201d said the 63-year-old comics artist. \u201cThe Bible is a part of it. I would ask anybody: Is it so easy to lose your connection to your ancestors and your land? Of course it isn\u2019t. For the Jewish people, that history is what made us what we are.\u201d\n\nThe red roofs of Ofra\u2019s homes are easily seen from Ein Yabrud, the Palestinian village across the road.\n\nAzmi Musleh, 53, a local farmer, said Ofra sits on land his family used to cultivate.\n\n\u201cThat land is my heart and soul. It is my family\u2019s heart and soul. We used to grow sesame, figs, olives, back to the time of my father, his father, and his father before him,\u201d Musleh said.\n\nMAALE ADUMIM/AL-EIZARIYA\n\nIsrael\u2019s settler communities are hardly homogeneous. Some settlers are driven by burning ideology. Others are just looking for a cheap apartment. Some of the settlements adjacent to Israel are seen by many Israelis as just regular towns, unlike the more isolated enclaves deep inside the West Bank.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like a settler,\u201d said Michele Coven-Wolgel, a 60-year-old lawyer from Maale Adumim, a large settlement about 15 minutes\u2019 drive from Jerusalem. \u201cShould we be annexed? Yes, we\u2019re a city of 41,000 people, we\u2019re a city, we have a mall.\u201d\n\nAgainst the backdrop of desert hills, the villas of Maale Adumim provide their inhabitants with a comfortable life. Education is good and transport to the city is easy.\n\nAli Farun, 74, from the Palestinian town of al-Eizariya, about 1.5 km (one mile) from Maale Adumim has little hope of the territory ever coming under Palestinian control.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they annex it to Jerusalem or if it remains West Bank - they control it, one way or another,\u201d said Farun.\n\nHAVAT GILAD/SARRA\n\nHavat Gilad, a cluster of prefab huts sprinkled across a hilltop deep in the West Bank, is home to about 45 families.\n\nIts residents say their presence in the West Bank fulfils God\u2019s biblical promise to the Jewish people and secures Israel\u2019s safety.\n\n\u201cThis belongs to the people of Israel, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d said Itai Zar, 43, who founded Havat Gilad in 2002 after his brother was shot dead by Palestinian militants nearby.\n\n\u201cEighteen years ago we came here, one family, and today we have a flourishing community.\u201d\n\nBothena Turabe, saw the settlement\u2019s growth from her Palestinian village Sarra, across the way.\n\n\u201cIn the night you look at them and you think there is nothing, and the next morning you look and you see there are more caravans,\u201d said Turabe, 47, a member of the village council. \u201cThis land is not yours to take - you\u2019re stealing it.\u201d\n\nBEITAR ILLIT/WADI FUKIN\n\nBeitar Illit is a settlement built for Israel\u2019s fast-growing ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.\n\nAccording to Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlements watchdog, Beitar Illit saw the most construction of all Israel\u2019s West Bank settlements in 2018.\n\nIts densely built apartment blocs and Dollar stores seem a world apart from Havat Gilad\u2019s huts and dirt roads. And unlike in Zar, residents cite financial concerns for moving here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here for ideological reasons,\u201d said David Hamburger, 36, a Beitar Illit shop owner. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to buy houses anywhere else besides settlements.\u201d\n\nWith large families, seven children on average, high unemployment and poverty, the ultra-Orthodox Jews seek cheap housing that will allow their close-knit community to live together.\n\nSlideshow (33 Images)\n\nFor Mohammad Awad, a 64-year-old farmer from Wadi Fukin, a Palestinian village next to Beitar Illit, it makes no difference why people come to live in the settlement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have peace between us because the main conflict between us is on a piece of land which they took by force, so how can I let a person steal my land, live in it and enjoy it, and live with him in peace?\u201d he said.\n\nFor the photo essay, click reut.rs/2m2Iekv", "description": "His people's link to the land goes back to biblical times, says the comics illustrator.
