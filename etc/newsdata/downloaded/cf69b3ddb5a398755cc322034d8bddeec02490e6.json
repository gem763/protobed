With a calf injury it is always very high risk, especially with his calves.\n\n\u201cJoel\u2019s knee is still irritated \u2013 we need to give him time. I don\u2019t know the exact time he will need but it will really need time to heal.\u201d\n\nLijnders also moved to ease fears about Mohamed Salah\u2019s availability for tomorrow\u2019s Carabao Cup clash against Arsenal.\n\nSalah limped off in the final stages of Sunday\u2019s win against Tottenham due to ongoing soreness in his ankle, but he took part in training on Monday and has been given the all-clear to play.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cMo is fine,\u201d said Lijnders.\n\n\u201cTowards the end of the game it is more precaution because the ankle gets more tired and he feels it a little bit more and we have to take him off. But he is fine, he is good.\n\n\u201cAll the others are fit, hungry and ready to go.\u201d", "description": "Mohamed Salah's availability for Arsenal Carabao Cup clash also discussed by Jurgen Klopp's assistant Pepijn Lijnders", "authors": ["Alex Harris", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20379631.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Liverpool-v-Newcastle-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
