In addition to having a lot of alcohol in his system, the presence of cannabis was also found in his blood. Officials determined that an accidental fall from the balcony where he liked to sit while he smoked was more likely than a suicide.\n\nCOUNTRY SINGER NED LEDOUX\u2019S DAUGHTER, 2, DIES IN CHOKING ACCIDENT\n\nSoon after he died, the model\u2019s family explained to People that they didn\u2019t think suicide was likely despite many outlets, and Gaga, reporting he took his own life.\n\nLADY GAGA'S TWEET SENDS FANS INTO A FRENZY: 'FAME IS PRISON'\n\n\u201cFor us, the family and close entourage, we feel there\u2019s too many inconsistencies around his death to rule it as a suicide, and for people to jump to conclusions that rapidly was disappointing,\u201d Genest\u2019s manager, Karim Leduc, said at the time. \u201cThe balcony from which he fell on the third floor was a very dangerous balcony\u2026It\u2019s a balcony that has very small rails/guards \u2014 an emergency/fire escape balcony \u2013 and he was leaning his back towards it like sitting on the ledge of the rail, and he fell from his backside onto the floor.\u201d\n\nThe coroner\u2019s report notes that Genest seemed happy at the time of his death. As the BBC notes, he was motivated by new projects, surrounded by a support system and had just become engaged.\n\nIn addition to his modeling career, Genest starred in Lady Gaga\u2019s music video for \u201cBorn This Way\u201d in 2011 where the duo played a suited-up zombie couple. Genest was known for his zombie-like tattoos that covered most of his body. The singer paid tribute to the model shortly after news broke that he died with words about suicide prevention. However, Gaga quickly issued an apology after fans noted she spoke too soon in ruling the death a suicide.\n\nELTON JOHN SAYS MADONNA WAS 'NASTY' TO LADY GAGA\n\n\u201cOut of respect for Rick\u2019s family, Rick & his legacy I apologize if I spoke too soon as there was no witnesses or evidence to support any conclusion for the cause of his death. I in no way meant to draw an unjust conclusion My deepest condolences to his entire family and friends,\u201d Gaga tweeted.\n\nShe continued: \u201cThe art we made was sacred to me and I was emotional, he was an incredible artist and his art and heart will live on. Rest In Peace You beautiful soul.\u201d", "description": "A coroner in Montreal ruled the 2018 death of model and Lady Gaga collaborator\u00a0\u201cZombie Boy\u201d Rick Genest an accident and not a suicide.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/lady-gaga-zombie-boy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
