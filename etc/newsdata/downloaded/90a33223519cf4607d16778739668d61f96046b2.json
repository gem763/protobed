It is the man he will meet again on Wednesday night, his Paris Saint-Germain counterpart, Nasser Al Khelaifi.\n\nBernabeu sources insist it is one reason why Madrid never quite went all in on Neymar this summer. Perez wanted to show sufficient respect to Al Khelaifi, to ensure everything was above board, and that the relationship between the two would remain friendly.\n\nIt is why, even allowing for the relative ease of a group also containing Club Brugge and Galatasaray, meetings off the pitch at the Parc des Prince on Wednesday could be far more influential to the future of the Champions League than the meeting on it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He impressed in last year\u2019s Europa League, and combines unpredictability in 1-v-1 situations with a useful end product to make him a daunting prospect to face. Getty Images 3/23 Renan Lodi, Atletico Madrid Replacing Filipe Luis at Atletico Madrid will be a tough task for Renan Lodi, but the Brazilian is Atletico\u2019s only natural left-back and will therefore be integral for Diego Simeone this season. Lodi is a typical marauding Brazilian full-back, and is a keen crosser of the ball which suits Atletico\u2019s style of play. Getty Images 4/23 Eljif Elmas, Napoli The Macedonian is an eager midfielder, to say the least. Elmas distributes the ball well and is usually on the move shortly after, and has displayed a keen appetite for winning the ball back. Signed from Fenerbahce this summer, he has impressed in his short time with Napoli as a player who is always happy to take possession of the ball. Getty Images 5/23 Colin Dagba, PSG PSG are not typically associated with blooding through their own young talent, with many academy prospects often being sold rather than nurtured. Dagba has escaped such a fate, and established himself as first-choice right-back under Thomas Tuchel, keeping three clean sheets in his three starts this season. AFP/Getty Images 6/23 Matthijs de Ligt, Juventus The Dutchman already seems like a generational talent and was immense in Ajax\u2019s run to the semi-finals last year. He will be under a microscope at Juventus, especially with Giorgio Chiellini injured, but has already shown incredible leadership qualities and the ability to bounce back from a rocky debut as he did with the Netherlands. Getty Images 7/23 Ferran Torres, Valencia Valencia\u2019s young winger is a first-team regular, despite being just 19. The Spaniard operates predominantly from the right-hand side of midfield as an old-school type of winger - stay wide, beat a man, cross the ball - but is also comfortable taking up positions across the attacking third. Getty Images 8/23 Lee Kang-in, Valencia To say that the South Korean midfielder has flair would be an understatement. The 18-year-old has been linked with Real Madrid and Manchester City and it is clear why. He has bags of natural ability and is more than capable of playing himself out of a tight spot anywhere on the pitch. The Valencia man also possesses great technique with his left foot, and has featured regularly in their matchday squads this season. Bongarts/Getty Images 9/23 Trent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool The Englishman\u2019s technical abilities are virtually unparalleled as a full-back, and many argue that he is already the best right-back in the world. In order to ratify such claims, Alexander-Arnold will have to help improve Liverpool\u2019s group stage away record from last year when they lost against PSG, Napoli and Red Star Belgrade, only just qualifying. Liverpool FC via Getty Images 10/23 Vinicius Jr, Real Madrid With Real Madrid\u2019s relatively small and injury hit squad, there is an expectation that Vinicius Jr will get chances to impress, particularly in games against Club Brugge and Galatasaray. The Brazilian has bags of flair and ability, but does need to work on his goal output before he can be considered as a more than a prospect. Getty Images 11/23 Victor Osimhen, Lille The Nigerian striker was signed with some of the fee Lille received for Nicholas Pepe, and looks to be a good investment with five goals in as many games in Ligue 1. Osimhen has shown he can handle the pressure of filling another\u2019s shoes, and will be seeking to impress as Lille\u2019s main man. AFP/Getty Images 12/23 Lisandro Martinez, Ajax One of two defenders signed to replace Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez has hit the ground running at Ajax, who themselves will be looking to take advantage of a group without a clear favourite (Chelsea, Valencia, Lille). Martinez\u2019s efforts from the back are sure to be crucial in any Champions League success they have. Getty Images 13/23 Florentino Luis, Benfica Benfica are synonymous with producing talented players, and Florentino Luis appears to be the latest prospect from Lisbon. The midfielder reads the game exceptionally well, and it is not uncommon to see him slide in to intercept a pass. He is a deft tackler, but is not without technique and is more than capable of playing around a pressing opponent AFP/Getty Images 14/23 Reece James, Chelsea After a very successful campaign with Wigan, the Chelsea full-back\u2019s stock seems to have risen substantially this season, despite not playing a game due to injury. Cesar Azpilicueta has not played well and has looked like a player who has played 205 games in four seasons, with James likely to be given minutes in the Champions League in order to give the club captain a much-needed rest. AFP/Getty Images 15/23 Houssem Aouar, Lyon Aouar has a wonderful ability of carrying the ball into the final third, and is also capable of operating in tight spaces in and around the box. The composed midfielder has established himself as one of Lyon\u2019s most important players in recent years, and is another who may move on next season. AFP/Getty Images 16/23 Ibrahima Konate, RB Leipzig The French defender is a towering presence at the heart of the Leipzig defence. With the German club handed a group they should back themselves to qualify from (Lyon, Zenit and Benfica), it is likely we will see Konate test himself in the latter stages of the competition as well. Bongarts/Getty Images 17/23 Ansu Fati, Barcelona Given his performances thus far for Barcelona, it seems inconceivable that Ansu Fati is just 16. The Barcelona shirt does not seem to weigh him down at all - he plays with a freedom and unpredictability that is extremely refreshing and is sure to get him further opportunities to impress this season. Getty Images 18/23 Tete, Shakhtar Donetsk The latest in Shakhtar\u2019s production line of young Brazilians, Tete joined the club from Gremio in February. The skillful winger has impressed in his short time at the club, and is capable of causing real problems from the right-hand side. AFP/Getty Images 19/23 Kai Havertz, Bayer Leverkusen Although he is only 20, Havertz has made over 100 appearances for Bayer Leverkusen. Last season in the Bundesliga he established himself as a goal-scoring midfielder, scoring 17 times. This season\u2019s Champions League campaign is the chance for Havertz to further showcase his ability to Europe\u2019s elite - with the expectation that he will leave Leverkusen at the end of this season. Bongarts/Getty Images 20/23 Mason Mount, Chelsea It is a rarity to see players transition from the Championship to the Premier League so easily, but Mount has taken to the Chelsea first team like a duck to water. The Englishman\u2019s game intelligence is astounding at such a young age, and will suit the demands of Champions League football. AFP/Getty Images 21/23 Dani Olmo, Dinamo Zagreb Dani Olmo starred for Spain at the under 21 Euros during the summer, and surprisingly was not snapped up from Dinamo Zagreb. He moved to Croatia from Barcelona\u2019s La Masia academy back in 2014 and has not looked back, winning the league\u2019s player of the year last season. The attacking midfielder will have plenty of opportunities to impress and potentially qualify, with Zagreb fighting Atalanta and Shakhtar Donetsk for second place behind Manchester City. Getty Images 22/23 Jadon Sancho, Borussia Dortmund Sancho\u2019s talents are well-established but he should not be satisfied with just being a recognised player. This season\u2019s Champions League, when Dortmund face Barcelona and Inter Milan, is the perfect stage for him to show he can cope with the pressure of expectation and be talked about in the elite bracket of players by leading by example. Bongarts/Getty Images 23/23 Joao Felix, Atletico Madrid At the age of just 19, Joao Felix has the weighty expectations of Atletico Madrid fans upon his shoulders. His abilities with the ball are immense, but is another who will be looking to prove that they can make the step up and perform under intense scrutiny.

Getty Images\n\nPerez was almost as stunned as Barcelona when PSG actually went and enacted Neymar\u2019s release clause back in the summer of 2017. It wasn\u2019t just the money involved, at \u00a3220m, but the meaning of it.\n\nAs someone who had caused a similar shockwave with exactly the same manoeuvre to first become Madrid president by enacting Luis Figo\u2019s release clause back in 2000, Perez fully understood everything behind this display of power. It made a serious impression on him. He was, in short, \u201cintimidated\u201d.\n\nPerez realised what PSG could do to his own club, if they had the will.\n\nSo he understood the need to get on the right side of PSG.\n\n\u201cImagine it,\u201d one Bernabeu source said. \u201cEven Florentino doesn\u2019t want to have a problems with them. He wouldn\u2019t dream of pissing off Al Khelaifi. They could buy up to his construction company!\u201d\n\nSo, Perez has actively looked to maintain a friendship. There are regular channels of communication, semi-regular meals, and occasional deals. You only have to look at the mutual favour the clubs agreed this summer, by effectively swapping a former first-choice goalkeeper for a prospective stand-in, as Keylor Navas went to Paris and Alphonse Areola to Madrid. The latter is happier to sit on the bench behind Thibaut Courtois, the former gets the starting football he craved.\n\nSuch deals are a far cry from the effective cold war that exists between PSG and Barcelona.\n\nIt does however mean that Perez can\u2019t use his usual transfer approach against the French champions, so that they won\u2019t come back with greater force against him. And this is where it gets intriguing, and where a flashpoint may eventually be inevitable.\n\nLike PSG, after all, there are a lot of suggestions that Madrid are now looking beyond Neymar. They are looking to the future, and Kylian Mbappe.\n\nHe is already Perez\u2019s next great project, in a line that includes Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.\n\nEveryone knows the way these pursuits usually go, with intensive media campaigns and Madrid just abrasively letting it be known \u2013 to pretty much the whole world, rather than the selling club \u2013 they won\u2019t take no for an answer. This will have to go a different way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for that Madrid don\u2019t insist on Mbappe,\u201d one source said. \u201cThey just can\u2019t be that direct. It has to be careful. In an ideal world, Mbappe would say he wants to go first.\u201d\n\nThat way, Perez\u2019s good relationship with PSG could prove extra advantageous, and potentially make such a transfer all the smoother.\n\nThe problem, and potential for complications, is Al Khelaifi\u2019s own vision of an ideal world. It is one in which Mbappe proves himself as the game\u2019s great successor to Ronaldo and Leo Messi, but always in a PSG jersey.\n\nThe French champions, after all, see Mbappe in the exact same way Madrid do.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t an ideal world which is why some complications are inevitable as the future of the club and the game.\n\nThis is where it could get testy.\n\nSome of the French club\u2019s hierarchy have already been suspicious about the exact source of the regular reports from Madrid media that PSG are on the brink of failing Financial Fair Play. There is also the knowledge that such speculation will play on the minds of players like Mbappe as much as anyone one.\n\nIt is almost symbolic, in that regard, that Mbappe will play on Wednesday and Neymar won\u2019t.\n\nSo much centres around him. You can only imagine the conversations off the pitch if he again proves devastating on it.", "description": "Florentino Perez is renowned as one of the bluntest and most headstrong figures in football, but those who know the Real Madrid president couldn\u2019t help noticing a change in his demeanour, in the presence of one specific individual.
