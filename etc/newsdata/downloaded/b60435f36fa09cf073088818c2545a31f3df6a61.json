But when they finally did this morning, when Archie joined his parents to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu, it was immediately clear who the little royal is taking after.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images More\n\nArchie is the spitting image of his father as a toddler. And yes, that means that (as has been previously reported) he's a ginger.\n\nPhoto credit: Tim Graham - Getty Images More\n\nThis wasn't exactly new information. Although it's the first time fans have seen Archie's resemblance to Prince Harry for themselves, comedian Ellen DeGeneres had already revealed the likeness on her show. Earlier this month, DeGeneres sang the royal couple's praises (\"seriously, they are so amazing\") and spoke about meeting baby Archie.\n\n\"The most important thing is that I got to hold little Archie, the baby,\" DeGeneres said. \"I fed Archie, I held Archie,\" she said, adding that \"he looks like Harry.\" She also joked that Archie \"had more hair than I did at the time.\"\n\nPhoto credit: HENK KRUGER - Getty Images More\n\nStill, royal watchers are relishing the rare glimpse of the baby\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the few details his parents have mentioned about him. During their meeting with Tutu and his daughter Thandeka, Harry said that Archie is \"constantly wanting to stand.\" Meghan laughed, and said that he's something of \"old soul.\" Harry agreed, noting, \"I think he knows exactly what's going on.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan's royal tour doesn't end until October 2, but there's no word on whether Archie will make another appearance during the trip. For now, fans will have to wait and see.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "Just like Ellen DeGeneres said!", "authors": ["Chloe Foussianes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kXFQ.sS0F9kR77zyI9UZTQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/f9ceb77a1e9f931e5ad508e93e5320ea", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
