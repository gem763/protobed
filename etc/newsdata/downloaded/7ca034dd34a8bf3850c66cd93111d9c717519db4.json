The respondents are the City, the municipal manager and Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato.\n\n\"Since some time last year, the City has been demolishing some homes [and] leaving some,\" Kumalo told News24 on Friday. \"We have been asking: 'Why is the City inconsistent and what authority do they use to demolish people's dwellings?'\"\n\nShacks have been built on land between a landfill site and Vrygrond, named Xakabantu.\n\nLand earmarked for construction, then later nature reserve\n\nKumalo explained that this particular piece of land was originally earmarked for a housing development and residents were asked to leave to facilitate construction.\n\nHowever, they had not seen any construction.\n\nThey moved back onto the land but then discovered it had been reclassified as part of a nature reserve, further complicating the issue.\n\nKhumalo claimed there was no public participation that included the residents themselves. In addition, the issue of creating a buffer zone between Xakabantu and the landfill site and the nature reserve had also arisen.\n\nIn May 2018, the City obtained an interim interdict preventing the further building of houses and the demolition of any new houses.\n\nKumalo said it was nailed to a tree and that some people living there were later \"given a number\" by the City allowing them to stay, but not all were given a number.\n\nThis process in itself is causing friction between people who received a number and those who did not. There were also allegations of \"number buying\".\n\nKumalo said the matter must be resolved once and for all because, as recently as June 18, more homes were demolished.\n\nElectioneering\n\nHe added that residents felt that officials seemed to accept Xakabantu as a suburb when they went there for electioneering, but not at other times.\n\n\"During elections, law enforcement officials took pictures. People came to campaign. They said 'Let people live there, let people stay;' and then one day they decide: 'Let's go and break everything down.'\"\n\nREAD: Vrygrond residents to restart land occupation\n\nResidents want to know whether the City is following due process in the demolition of shacks.\n\nOn Friday, Judge Ashley Binns-Ward decided that the case should include oral evidence from witnesses. The case was postponed for an urgent date for the hearing from Judge President John Hlophe.\n\nThe Xakabantu issue comes weeks after the legality of a massive house-bulldozing operation in Johannesburg's Alexandra was questioned.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A court challenge in an ongoing demolish-and-rebuild stand-off between the City of Cape Town and residents in Vrygrond, near Muizenberg, may bring some clarity about eviction processes relating to the illegal occupation of land.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9025/43bf5895699c4f448201fb48bf527e4a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-25"}
