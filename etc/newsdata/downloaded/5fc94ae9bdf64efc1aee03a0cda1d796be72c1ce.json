Having arrived in Japan just days before the competition was wrapped up, I managed to get myself a ticket to head down to Tokyo\u2019s Ryogoku Sumo Hall, an 11,000-seat arena nestled away on the east bank of the Sumida River.\n\nIt was a sporting spectacle quite unlike any I\u2019ve witnessed before. The ritualised pageantry. The solemn recitations. The throwing of salt to purify the ring. The slapping of arms, legs and bellies \u2013 demonstrations to prove the wrestlers are unarmed. And then, at last, the sudden, breathless eruption of violence. There was a mesmeric quality to the experience, one that dragged you slowly back in time to the sport\u2019s ancient roots.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBecause, unlike any other mainstream sport in Japan, sumo wrestling remains deeply wedded to its past. The same set of rules and rites which applied when matches were performed in the Japanese imperial courts, as far back as the eighth century, continue to influence today\u2019s proceedings.\n\nHow exactly sumo started, historians are unsure. But links have been made to harvest rituals associated with the Shinto religion. That legacy can be seen in the gold-tinged kimono worn by the referee, with his ceremonial fan to hand, and the stylised, shrine-like roof which covers the ring, or dohyo as it\u2019s known in Japanese.\n\nIn all, it made for a stark contrast to the relentless rush and buzz that has come with following the Rugby World Cup. Later in the week, I\u2019ll be exploring sumo in more depth as I touch upon its social and cultural significance to Japan, but also the scandal and controversy which has come to mar the sport in recent years. So make sure to keep an eye out. Safe to say the world of sumo isn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect.\n\nYours,\n\nSamuel Lovett\n\nSports reporter", "description": "The Rugby World Cup may be dominating the headlines here in Japan \u2013 covering both the front and back pages of the national newspapers \u2013 but it\u2019s not the only sport that\u2019s been grabbing the attention of the locals.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/15/20/Sumo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
