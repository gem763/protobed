And while returning to tried-and-true recipes each year is part of the fun, if you\u2019ve recently switched up your diet by going vegan or dairy-free, you\u2019re probably on the hunt for some plant-based takes on those classic concoctions. Enter, this Vegan Potato, Leek & Artichoke Chowder from Jeanine Donofrio\u2019s cookbook Love and Lemons Every Day. Packed with all kinds of vegetables, this variation captures the creaminess of its predecessor with potatoes and cashews, so you can enjoy every drop without worrying about the dairy.\n\nVegan Potato, Leek & Artichoke Chowder\n\nBy Jeanine Donofrio\n\nI did a poll on Instagram one day where I asked what soups people would like me to make. I love all soups, but sometimes I suffer from soup indecision. There was an overwhelming number of requests for chowders and leek soups, so\u2026 request granted. This potato leek chowder gets its creaminess from potatoes and blended cashews. With a nice pop of flavor from the briny artichokes and capers, it\u2019s most delicious finished with a little lemon juice and fresh dill.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling\n\nleeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced and rinsed (3 \u00bd cups)\n\n\u00bd cup chopped celery\n\n\u00bd cup chopped carrots\n\n\u00bd tsp sea salt, plus more to taste\n\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n\n1 \u00bd lbs Yukon Gold potatoes, chopped\n\n4 cups vegetable broth\n\n1 (14 oz) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped\n\n\u00bd cup raw cashews\n\n1 \u00bd tsp Dijon mustard\n\n1 tbsp capers\n\n3 tbsp fresh lemon juice\n\n\u00bd to 1 cup water\n\n\u00bc cup fresh dill, plus more for garnish\n\n\u00bc cup chopped chives\n\nPreparation\n\nHeat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, celery, carrots, the salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes, turning down the heat if they start to over-brown.\n\nAdd the garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute more. Add the potatoes and the broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Stir in the artichokes.\n\nLet cool slightly, then transfer one-third of the soup to a blender along with the cashews, mustard, capers, and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Puree until smooth, and then pour the mixture back into the soup pot. Stir in the water, as desired, to thin. Add the dill and the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Season to taste with more salt and pepper and serve.\n\nGarnish with more dill, the chives, and a drizzle of olive oil.\n\nLeftover soup can be stored in the fridge for three to four days. Avoid freezing.\n\nYield: Makes 6 servings\n\nExcerpted from Love and Lemons Every Day: More than 100 Bright, Plant-Forward Recipes for Every Meal by Jeanine Donofrio.
