Hedge funds and asset managers have been paring their bets on a weaker pound, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nTraders are repositioning for what could be a swift and brutal move in the currency when the outcome of this week\u2019s negotiations becomes clearer. The clock is ticking down to Thursday\u2019s crunch summit of EU leaders, where Johnson could secure a deal before presenting it to the U.K. Parliament on Saturday, or hurtle faster toward a chaotic exit on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really important here is that you have engagement,\u201d said Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s global head of currency research George Saravelos, who sees the Brexit talks as a potential game-changer for markets. \u201cThere\u2019s a notable shift away from this hard Brexit strategy,\u201d he said in a Bloomberg Television interview.\n\nMarkets are still relatively optimistic about a Brexit deal, with the pound holding most of its gains after jumping the most in two years last week. The recent rally could have much further to run if a Brexit deal is secured but the pound has far to fall without one, according to Mizuho Bank Ltd. Gains could extend more than 3% to $1.30 if a divorce agreement emerges. If Johnson\u2019s plan fails it could slump almost 3% to $1.22.\n\nThe pound has seen big moves in recent days, with the spread between the highs and lows in the pound-dollar exchange rate touching the highest level since March on Friday. Deutsche Bank ended its recommendation to sell the pound last week after a positive meeting between Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Saravelos sees the potential for more big swings if this week\u2019s EU summit results in a deal.\n\n\u201cIf you do have agreement there, there\u2019s quite a lot of risk premium to remove and the sterling price action could be quite quick as we saw on Thursday and Friday,\u201d he said.\n\nThe market remains overwhelmingly tilted in favor of selling the pound, though both hedge funds and asset managers have lowered their short positions, according to the latest data from the CFTC. Options traders are betting on gains in the short term.\n\nThe pound may continue to strengthen if negotiations between the U.K. and the EU intensify, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\n\u201cIf the two sides do make more progress toward a deal, continued short-covering from real money investors should prolong the rally,\u201d said analysts including New York-based Zach Pandl, Goldman\u2019s co-head of global foreign-exchange and emerging-market strategy. \u201cWe think sterling has further to run.\u201d\n\n(Writes through, adds pricing from first paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Vonnie Quinn and Guy Johnson.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Charlotte Ryan in London at cryan147@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Dobson at pdobson2@bloomberg.net, William Shaw\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The pound swung as traders attempted to read the tea leaves on the likelihood of the U.K. securing a Brexit deal as soon as this week.Sterling pared declines after falling 1.2%, as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d despite skepticism from the European Union", "authors": ["Charlotte Ryan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cmu1B0t89LEXq_C28HMAFA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/66b9a7527164e552548378a0a1bea77d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
