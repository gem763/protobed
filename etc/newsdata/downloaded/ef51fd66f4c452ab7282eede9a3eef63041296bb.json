Her lawyers want to void the 2010 deal and collect at least $200,000 more from Ronaldo. They acknowledge Mayorga received $375,000 in 2010. The court has kept the original agreement sealed.\n\nMayorga's lawyers maintain she didn't break the confidentiality pledge. They accuse Ronaldo or his associates of allowing reports of it to appear in European publications in 2017.\n\nThe soccer star's lawyers have said the information was among electronic data hacked, stolen and sold by cybercriminals, and that Mayorga's lawsuit is being used to damage Ronaldo's reputation.\n\nMayorga's lawsuit said she met Ronaldo at a nightclub and went with him and other people to his suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino, where he assaulted her in a bedroom.\n\nLas Vegas police last year reinvestigated the rape allegation, but no criminal charge was filed. The local elected prosecutor said there was not enough evidence to take the 10-year-old case to trial.\n\nRonaldo, now 34, is one of the richest athletes in the world. He plays in Italy for the Turin-based soccer club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team.\n\nMayorga, now 36, is a former schoolteacher and model who lives in the Las Vegas area.\n\nStovall has alleged that Mayorga, then 25, was so stressed by pressure from \"fixers\" trying to protect the reputation of Ronaldo, then 24, that she lacked the legal capacity to sign a non-disclosure agreement 10 years ago.\n\nA federal judge in Las Vegas has not set a hearing date on Ronaldo's bid to stop the court case.", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers have filed court documents asking a U.S. judge in Las Vegas to either dismiss a Nevada woman's lawsuit alleging the soccer star raped her in 2009, or to order closed-door settlement talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/SOC-Cristiano-Ronaldo5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
