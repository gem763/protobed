What makes it more incredible is that there is no subdivision for disabled athletes to qualify.\n\n\u201cOur time is no different than the 20-year-olds or the 80-year-olds,\" Beth James said.\n\nAn Ironman race starts with the swimming portion. Liza James, who weighs about 100 pounds, is strapped into a float that is attached to Beth James.\n\nJim Bolser/Peak Media\n\nWhen it comes time for the 122-mile bike ride, Liza James is seated in a racing chair that weighs 21 pounds and is connected to the bike pedaled by Beth James.\n\nFinally, for the marathon portion, Liza James sits in the racing chair that resembles a stroller as Beth James powers through.\n\nCall her \u201cIronmom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really need to stop and think what humans are capable of if you can channel something like that maternal love instinct that she has for her daughter,\u201d trainer Peter Defty said.\n\nBeth and Liza James finished the first two portions of the race, but missed the cutoff time for the third in the Ironman World Championship. Still, Beth and Liza James have finished an Ironman race before.\n\nPerhaps Beth James\u2019 physical toughness stems from her mental toughness.\n\nIn 2004, Beth James and her three children were making the approximately one-mile drive home from a Fourth of July party when they got into a life-changing accident.\n\nBeth James says she was turning left at a green light when her car got nicked from behind and spun around. Liza James\u2019 head hit the interior of the vehicle and she suffered a severe brain injury.\n\nLiza James, then 6 years old, was in a coma for more than two months. Beth James said doctors had to cut part of her skull -- about the size of Beth James\u2019 palm -- to allow the brain to swell.\n\nThat ended up saving her life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly a miracle that they kept her with us,\u201d Beth James said.\n\nLiza James is healthy, but she needs assistance eating and drinking.\n\nBeth James\n\nThree months after the accident, Beth James developed a noncancerous brain tumor the size of a golf ball. She got it removed in time by the same neurosurgeon who saved Liza James\u2019 life.\n\nLiza James eventually woke up, and Beth James recovered from her brain issue. Beth James was a single mother with three kids. The shock and trauma of it all was hitting her.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Beth, you need to get up. You need to care for the children. You need to go for a run. You need to clear your head.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe set a goal to run a marathon months after she and her daughter suffered brain injuries. When she finally ran the marathon, she was thinking the whole time about how to include Liza James.\n\nSo Beth James got a racing chair for Liza James to sit in while she ran. She started by running a 5-kilometer race, then a 10-kilometer race and continued to work her way up.\n\n\u201cEven though Liza cannot speak, she can communicate,\u201d Beth James said. \u201cShe immediately told me, \u2018Don\u2019t stop, mom. Don\u2019t slow down, mom. Let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo Beth James kept going. She says Liza James communicates to her through hand gestures and noises.\n\nIn the past four years, Beth James has worked her way up to triathlons, sometimes training for up to 10 hours a day. And even though Beth James is not new to Ironman races -- she ran her first one in 1999 -- the added motivation of competing with Liza James, the race has taken on a whole new meaning.\n\n\u201cLife is a gift,\u201d Beth James said. \u201cEach and every moment of each and every day is priceless. Don\u2019t ever take it for granted. Do not ever complain. There\u2019s always positives surrounding you.\u201d", "description": "They are the first mother-daughter duo to compete in the Ironman World Championship, which is, essentially, the Super Bowl of Ironman triathlons", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/beth-james-01-gty-jef-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
