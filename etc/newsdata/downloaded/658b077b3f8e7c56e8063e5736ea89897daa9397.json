Marc Jacobs did it with his \u201credux grunge\u201d capsule last year. Versace did a \u201ctribute collection\u201d on the 20th anniversary of Gianni\u2019s death. And today, Anna Sui announced that she is working with Opening Ceremony to bring back some of her best-selling styles to coincide with her retrospective at the Museum of Art and Design, which opens September 12.\n\nThe capsule is broken down into five themes, which correspond to the exhibit as well: Americana, Mod, Punk, Victorian, and Surfer. \u201cI think I\u2019m a product of a typical middle-class suburban upbringing,\u201d said Sui of her obsession with pop culture, movies, and music. She would go on to dress everyone from \u201990s supermodels to grunge musicians like Courtney Love.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in California, Anna Sui was an amazing figure in the cultural scene,\u201d says Opening Ceremony co-founder Humberto Leon, who now considers Sui a close friend. She was also the first Asian person working in fashion he\u2019d ever heard of. He remembers visiting New York in 1999, and going straight to the Anna Sui Soho store to buy one of the designer\u2019s signature \u201cbaby tees,\u201d which have been reissued as part of the capsule. Leon also still has the original.\n\nFor Sui, the experience of going through her archives has been illuminating.\n\n\u201c\u2018New\u2019 comes in many forms, not just the unexpected, \u2018never seen it before,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes what we considered wrong becomes right. Looking at the selection at Opening Ceremony, people will find that so much of our culture is still fixated on the past. Maybe it\u2019s our comfort zone, a retreat from the harsh reality of what today is. But there is also the satisfaction of finding what we missed out on the first time around!\u201d\n\nBelow, photos from the limited-edition capsule collection, which is available exclusively at O.C.
