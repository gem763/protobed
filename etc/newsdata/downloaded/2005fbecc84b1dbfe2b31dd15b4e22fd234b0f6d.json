Vick (13-4 MMA, 9-4 UFC) is moving up to the UFC welterweight division for the first time, but the reason he made the move is because of three consecutive losses at lightweight.\n\nDropping four fights in a row is a deep hole to get out of, and that\u2019s why Vick can\u2019t allow himself to look past the next fight.\n\n\u201cSo much is riding on this fight,\u201d Vick told MMA Junkie on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not delusional. I\u2019ve lost three fights in a row. I lose this fight, I might not be in the UFC no more. I\u2019m not delusional like that. Everything is riding on this fight Saturday night.\u201d\n\nVick said the decision to change weight classes wasn\u2019t so much about the difficulty cutting to 155 pounds, but the fact he dropped consecutive fights to Justin Gaethje, Paul Felder and Dan Hooker. He fell out of the rankings after that slump, and he said if he\u2019s going to work his way back in, it might as well be in a division in which he\u2019s more comfortable.\n\nThe shift to welterweight hasn\u2019t been as smooth as Vick envisioned, though. He said camp didn\u2019t look all that different than previous ones, and the fact he wasn\u2019t pushing himself to the extreme in every facet is playing mind tricks on him.\n\n\u201cIt feels weird because I feel like I\u2019m not sacrificing as much,\u201d Vick said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of messing with me mentally. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to be undersized or small or anything, but I feel like cutting the weight is part of the sacrifice. I didn\u2019t even start my diet until about two weeks ago.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Vick said he is expecting a win at UFC on ESPN+ 19, which takes place at Amalie Arena and streams on ESPN+. He likes how he matches up with Price and said so long as he fights intelligently, he will emerge triumphant.\n\n\u201cIf I keep my hands up and my chin down and don\u2019t get caught with a big shot, I\u2019m going to win this fight,\u201d Vick said. \u201cI think I can beat this guy pretty easily on the feet. I think I can outpoint him all day or catch him and knock him out.\u201d", "description": "James Vick, on the rise not long ago, realizes this could be his last UFC fight if he loses four in a row.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/james-vick-ufc-tampa-pre-fight-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
