Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNadal put pressure on the underdog Italian\u2019s serve from the start but Berrettini saved six break points to set up a first set tie breaker.\n\nBerrettini raced out to a 4-0 lead thanks to some uncharacteristically sloppy play from the Spaniard and the 23-year-old had two set points at 4-6.\n\nBut Berrettini suddenly got tight and Nadal took advantage, wearing him down in the extended baseline rallies and capturing the set when the Italian sent a forehand long for his 20th unforced error, leading Nadal to let out a roar.\n\nNadal broke Berrettini on his 10th opportunity to take a 4-3 lead in the second set and cruised to the finish, absorbing Berrettini\u2019s powerful forehands and redirecting them to his weaker backhand side to see off the first time slam semi-finalist.\n\n\u201cThe first set was a little bit frustrating because I had a lot of break points and you don\u2019t want to be in a tiebreak against a player like Matteo,\u201d Nadal said.\n\n\u201cI survived that moment and finally I had the break ... I think I started to play with more calm and was more aggressive.\n\n\u201cI just tried to stay focused on the next point.\u201d\n\nNadal tipped his hat to the 24th seeded Berrettini, who came through several epic battles to reach the semis in New York.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s young and he has everything,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already one of the best players in the world.\u201d\n\nNext up for Nadal is a showdown with big-serving Russian Medvedev, who was a straight sets winner over Grigor Dimitrov earlier in the day. The pair\u2019s only previous meeting took place in the final of last month\u2019s Rogers Cup in Montreal, where Nadal was a 6-3 6-0 winner.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the more solid players on tour,\u201d Nadal said of the 23-year-old, who will be appearing in his fourth consecutive final and first at a Grand Slam.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taking steps forward every single week, having an amazing summer. I need to be playing at my best.\n\n\u201cAs always in a Grand Slam final you can\u2019t expect an easy opponent.\u201d\n\nVictory in Sunday\u2019s final would leave Nadal just one Grand Slam shy of Roger Federer\u2019s men\u2019s record of 20.", "description": "Rafa Nadal moved to the brink of a 19th career Grand Slam title on Friday by beating Matteo Berrettini 7-6(6) 6-4 6-1 to reach the U.S. Open final.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427128729&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8605D", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
