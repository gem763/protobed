Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee who passed away early Thursday morning, for signing subpoenas in his hospital bed just hours before his untimely death.\n\nCummings, 68, passed away at Johns Hopkins Hospital early Thursday morning due to \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d according to his office. He had previously undergone an unspecified medical procedure, which ultimately prevented him from going back to work. Despite that, the lawmaker reportedly signed two subpoenas in his hospital bed, just hours before his death. The subpoenas were associated with a policy that \u201callowed some immigrants with severe health issues to remain in the US,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nHis signature followed a September House Oversight subcommittee hearing featuring a 16-year-old Honduran boy battling cystic fibrosis, who told lawmakers he feared he would die if he had to go back to his country. The Trump administration ultimately reversed its position, granting \u201ctemporary reprieve from deportation for immigrants facing life-threatening medical conditions and other humanitarian circumstances,\u201d CBS News reported.\n\nAides reportedly drove the documents \u2014 related to the policy \u2014 to Cummings in Baltimore on Wednesday so he could sign them:\n\nCummings was active until the end, an aide tells me. He signed subpoenas from his hospital bed and as recently as Friday helped lead a Democratic caucus conference call. https://t.co/2qkxi4Em7O \u2014 Sheryl Gay Stolberg (@SherylNYT) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cChairman Cummings felt so strongly about the children, that he was going to fight until the end,\u201d an aide reportedly said.\n\nFar-left \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) praised the \u201cforever Chairman\u201d for \u201cpursuing justice for immigrants\u201d in his final hours.\n\n\u201cAs I was paying my respects to our forever Chairman, his staff told me that in his final hours he signed subpoenas to USCIS and ICE, pursuing justice for immigrants in my district & across the country with chronic medical conditions,\u201d Pressley wrote in a tweet accompanied by a picture of the Massachusetts lawmaker viewing flowers in front of the late chairman\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cA man of his word every moment of his life,\u201d she added:\n\nAs I was paying my respects to our forever Chairman, his staff told me that in his final hours he signed subpoenas to USCIS and ICE, pursuing justice for immigrants in my district & across the country with chronic medical conditions.
