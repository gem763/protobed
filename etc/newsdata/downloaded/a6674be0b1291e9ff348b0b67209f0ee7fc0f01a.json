The teenager has scored 20 goals in 13 games for Salzburg this season including a Champions League hat-trick against Genk.\n\nSolskjaer knows his Norwegian compatriot Haaland, 19, very well from their time together at Molde before the former United favourite returned to Old Trafford as manager last December.\n\nErling Haaland has been smashing in goals this season and linked with Manchester United\n\nBut even though United are in the market for a striker after letting Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez leave last summer, Solskjaer is reluctant to be drawn on talk of a move for Haaland.\n\n'I don't think it's the time now for me to talk about other teams' strikers,' said Solskjaer. 'I spoke about Harry Kane yesterday and Erling today, I don't think it's right for me.'\n\nSolskjaer had been drawn into commenting on Kane on the eve of United's Europa League win over Partizan Belgrade in Serbia after his former team-mate Roy Keane had urged him to sign the England captain from Tottenham.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has refused to be drawn into talking about a move for the Norwegian\n\nHaaland scored twice against Napoli on Wednesday and has 20 goals in 13 games\n\nSolskjaer responded by saying: 'Roy's quite straight-forward isn't he?

They're like (Alan) Shearer, (Ruud) Van Nistelrooy, fantastic goalscorers.\n\n'Ours are different types of players, but I have to say I like someone who can finish half a chance and he does that. He's one of the best, but he's a Tottenham player.'", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has refused to be drawn on speculation linking Manchester United with a move for prolific Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Haaland.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20171080-0-image-a-13_1571992031514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
