For LRT riders stressed by crowds, there's support | CBC News", "language": "en", "text": "As locals adjust to light rail commutes, stymied by door jams and overcrowding, an Ottawa mental health hotline wants passengers to know it's there for them.\n\nAnyone feeling anxiety, claustrophobia or other issues triggered by the new LRT system can get in touch with the Distress Centre of Ottawa and Region \u2014 right from the payphones in the LRT stations.\n\n\"It can feel like a weight is on your chest. It can feel like you can't take a deep enough breath. You can start to sweat,\" said spokesperson Leslie Scott, describing what anxiety can feel like on mass transit.\n\n\"Our first and foremost message is we're here.\"\n\nRiders on the Confederation Line faced lengthy delays Tuesday and Wednesday, due to jammed train doors. In both cases, OC Transpo had to run back-up buses to get commuters \u2014 who converged in the hundreds at some stations \u2014 on their way.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised hearing people have had a lot of anxiety,\" said Kanata commuter Samantha Sensenstein.\n\nSamantha Sensenstein (bottom left) takes a selfie Wednesday morning at Tunney's Pasture station in Ottawa. (supplied by Samantha Sensenstein)\n\n'Absolutely madness'\n\nThe 23-year-old travels from her home near Hazeldean Road to Carleton University. On both Tuesday and Wednesday she got \"sardined\" in, she said, with hundreds of others at Tunney's Pasture station.\n\nSensenstein saw riders vent their frustrations out loud, cut through crowds and elbow their way onto buses.\n\n\"It was just absolutely madness,\" Sensenstein said. \"It was absolutely packed full and I didn't really feel like it was safe.\"\n\nJuliett Bassong's trip Wednesday morning from St-Laurent station to Rideau was similarly unpleasant.\n\n\"I was anxious because we were so packed. It's ridiculous. There's no room. You can't breathe,\" Bassong said.\n\nThe distress centre has a partnership with OC Transpo where LRT riders can call the 24-hour hotline for free, in French or English, directly using the payphones located on station platforms.\n\nPassengers on the Confederation Line can contact the Distress Centre of Ottawa and Region by pressing the bottom, far-right buttons on payphones at station platforms. (Laura Glowacki/CBC)\n\nInitially for suicide prevention\n\nThe hotline was first installed as a suicide prevention service, Scott said, but is available for any and all mental health concerns.\n\n\"We're talking to people that may just have had a really rough day at work. They're getting to the platform. It's busy. They're stressed out and they just want to talk to somebody before they get going home,\" she said.\n\n\"You have live support right away for whatever you're experiencing.\"\n\nThe centre has received six calls from passengers since the Confederation Line went into service Sept. 14, said Scott. She believes many more people could benefit if they only knew the line exists.\n\nAlong with calling the centre, Scott suggests people experiencing anxiety to practice a little self-care. That might include putting in earbuds and listening to calming music and podcasts, she said, or performing deep-breathing exercises.\n\nAnyone in the Ottawa area can call the distress line for free at 613-238-3311. People in the Outaouais can reach the Distress Centre of Ottawa and Region by calling 1-866-676-1080, toll-free.", "description": "As transit riders adjust to commutes, stymied by door jams and overcrowding,\u00a0an Ottawa mental health hotline wants passengers to know it's there for them.", "authors": ["Laura Glowacki Is A Reporter Based In Ottawa", "Winnipeg.
