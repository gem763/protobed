That means legislators have given approval in principle to hold a snap election \u2014 something they have thus far refused to do three times. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants an election to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit.\n\nBut the bill now faces a potentially challenging committee stage at which MPs could amend the date.\n\nDeputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle \u2014 who presides over this stage of the bill's passage \u2014 selected just one amendment that could prove contentious: a bid by opposition MPs to change the election date to December 9. The house has up to two hours to debate that before a vote.\n\nIf that amendment passes, the government could itself attempt to change the date later in the process. It had earlier indicated it would be willing to accept an earlier date than December 12.\n\nJohnson told the Commons Tuesday afternoon: \u201cThere is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism, this endless, wilful, fingers crossed, not me guv refusal to deliver on the mandate of the people, and that is to refresh this parliament and give the people a choice.\u201d\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn had previously said his MPs would block a December election, but changed his mind after pressure from other opposition parties.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get out there on the streets. In every town and village in this country, Labour will be there, giving a message of real hope where this government offers nothing.\u201d\n\nJohnson suffered a blow earlier when MPs voted to allow amendments to be proposed for the bill \u2014 but the government indicated there would be limits to changes it would tolerate.\n\nIf the bill passes the committee stage it will be on course to pass the Commons later Tuesday ready for scrutiny in the House of Lords on Wednesday.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
