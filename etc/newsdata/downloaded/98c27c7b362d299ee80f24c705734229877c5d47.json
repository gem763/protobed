Seven of the Association's twenty-eight founding members have now abandoned it, including big hitters like PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Stripe. Latin American online payments platform Mercado Pago and US online travel firm Booking Holdings have also cut ties.\n\nRead more: Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency plan just got formalised, but a quarter of its backers have now dropped out\n\nThe Association's 21 remaining members include Facebook, Spotify, Uber and Lyft. On Monday, those firms agreed upon the association's charter and its leadership council, formally establishing the Libra Association. That 21-member council also appointed a five-person board of directors, which includes Marcus.\n\nPayPal was the first major firm to leave the Libra Association (pictured is its president and CEO Dan Schulman).

On Monday, Libra's newly appointed deputy chairman Dante Disparte told The Financial Times that regulatory barriers would likely delay the cryptocurrency's proposed 2020 launch.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said Libra \"will have little standing or dependability,\" while Democratic Congressperson Rashida Tlaib reportedly asked if Facebook was trying to create a \"crypto mafia\" by setting up the Libra Association.\n\nMarcus has previously been outspoken in his defence of the project. In a tweet on Friday about the exits of Mastercard and others, he wrote: \"I would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update. Of course, it's not great news in the short term, but in a way it's liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you're on to something when so much pressure builds up.\"", "description": "David Marcus says Libra is 'absolutely not' in jeopardy after a swathe of major firms abandoned the Libra Association in the past fortnight.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da6ed16cc4a0a14e3644d33?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
