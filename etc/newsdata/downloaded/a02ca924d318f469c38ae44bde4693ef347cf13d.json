(Michel Aspirot/Radio-Canada)\n\nPublic outcry\n\nHealth professionals in the region have long lobbied for improvements, but Place said he's hoping an orchestrated public outcry will be more effective in reaching the ears of decision-makers.\n\n\"The letter is a way for citizens to express themselves and give a little boost to [MNAs] so they can go in and negotiate better services and more resources for us,\" he said.\n\nResidents can register on the SOS 07 website and sign their names to a letter outlining their funding concerns. The group also plans to use the responses to generate a survey for candidates in the next provincial election.\n\nSOS 07 joins a number of advocacy groups working to improve health care in the region.\n\nThe more people that are asking for the same things together,the more likely we are to see some action,' said Andrew Gibson, president of Sant\u00e9 Outaouais 2020. (CBC)\n\nAlarm sounded\n\nAndrew Gibson, president of Sant\u00e9 Outaouais 2020, said it's important for politicians to feel pressure from the public.\n\n\"The more people that are asking for the same things together, the more likely we are to see some action,\" Gibson said.\n\nAdvocacy group \u00c9quit\u00e9 Outaouais has already sounded the alarm, noting in a recent report that Outaouais residents often rely on health care services in neighbouring Ontario. For example, every year, hundreds of women from the region cross the Ottawa River to give birth.\n\n\u00c9quit\u00e9 Outaouais also warned of a lack of health-care professionals and training in the region.\n\nThe CAQ's minister responsible for the Outaouais, Matheiu Lacombe, says his door is open to meet with residents and groups looking to discuss health-care funding in the region. (Radio-Canada)\n\nMathieu Lacombe, the provincial minister responsible for the Outaouais, said he learned of the existence of SOS 07 Tuesday morning and, as of Tuesday afternoon, hadn't been contacted by anyone from the group. He invited its representatives to contact him to make an appointment.\n\n\"If this new group wants to [track us], I think it cannot be a bad idea. We are accountable for our decisions,\" he said. \"My door is open.\"\n\nLacombe said he has met with \u00c9quit\u00e9 Outaouais and Sant\u00e9 Outaouais 2020 to discuss regional health issues. He said over the past year, the Legault government made changes to the Centre int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux de l'Outaouais (CISSSO) \u2014 the organization responsible for overseeing hospitals and health services in the region \u2014 decentralizing some management and commissioning a plan to integrate 170 new beds.\n\nIn a statement to CBC, CISSSO said it was \"constantly seeking to improve care and services,\" and is currently working with an expert to \"review clinical trajectories.\"", "description": "Advocates in the Outaouais have embarked on a letter-writing campaign urging the province to improve health services in the region.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4037980.1571164081!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hull-hospital-sign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
