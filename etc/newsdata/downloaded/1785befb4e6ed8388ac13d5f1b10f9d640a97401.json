We\u2019re all different, and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay, that we\u2019re all different.\u201d\n\nThe presenter used the example that while she wishes people didn\u2019t wear real fur, she has a lot of friends who do.\n\n\u201cBut just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything, doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them,\u201d DeGeneres said.\n\n\u201cWhen I say be kind to one another, I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the segment, DeGeneres said she was invited to the game by the owner of Dallas Cowboys\u2019 daughter, Charlotte Jones.\n\nShe also showed a video she took herself from the game that featured Bush and his wife smiling and laughing next to her.\n\nIn reference to the social media response to the photos, DeGeneres said that people \u201cdid what people do when they\u2019re mad \u2013 they tweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were upset. They thought, \u2018Why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u2019\u201d DeGeneres added.\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s one tweet that I loved: this person says, \u2018Ellen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe reactions to seeing DeGeneres and the former president sitting side by side ranged from bemused to critical.\n\n\u201cSo quirky and fun to see George Bush out with Ellen at a Cowboys game after his terrible foreign policy decisions killed thousands of innocent people,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAnother added: \u201cLaura & George Bush sitting with Ellen Degeneres and Portia de Rossi is not something I expected to see at an NFL game. I would absolutely watch this sitcom though.\u201d\n\nWhile a third person commented: \u201cName a more weird couple.\u201d.", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres has defended her friendship with George W.
