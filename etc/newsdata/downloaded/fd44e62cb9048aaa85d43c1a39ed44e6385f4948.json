(Picture: North News)\n\nA \u2018venomous\u2019 girlfriend with a history of domestic violence stabbed her partner through the heart.\n\nNicola Lee knifed Paul Taylor in the kitchen of her home on the evening of March 30 \u2013 then claimed her victim had inflicted the fatal wound himself.\n\nJurors at Newcastle Crown Court rejected her version of events and found the 44-year-old, of Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, guilty of manslaughter \u2013 but not murder.\n\nFollowing her conviction, Northumbria Police released shocking body cam footage of her swearing, struggling and being aggressive with officers who arrested her after she was told Mr Taylor had passed away.\n\nDuring the trial, jurors heard evidence from two previous partners of Lee, who said they had been victims of her violence in the past and had both suffered injuries inflicted by her with knives.\n\nOne told police he was \u2018frightened\u2019 of Lee and explained: \u2018The trigger could be anything and that\u2019s the truth, it could be something on the telly.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018It could be 14 or 15 hours of verbal abuse.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man said Lee had warned him \u2018I will kill you\u2019 and added: \u2018From her, I would take it serious.\n\n\u2018Yes, she\u2019s a woman, but I\u2019m actually frightened of her.\u2019\n\nThe man said Lee would \u2018escalate from verbal to physical\u2019 and added: \u2018I\u2019m not lying when I say basically every week she threatened to kill me.\u2019\n\nThe second former partner said Lee had grabbed him by the testicles during a violent row and then injured his arm when she picked up a knife.\n\nHowever, the jury felt there was not enough proof that Lee had intended to kill her partner, finding her not guilty of murder.\n\nLee has a history of domestic abuse and was described as \u2018viciously aggressive\u2019 (Picture: North News & Pictures Ltd)\n\nA former neighbour told the court Lee was \u2018manipulative, calculating, venomous, dangerous, viciously aggressive\u2026 and a compulsive liar (who) preys on the vulnerable.\u2019\n\nProsecutor Caroline Goodwin QC told the court on the night that Mr Taylor, 45, lost his life, Lee was \u2018drunk, aggressive and argumentative\u2019.\n\nMs Goodwin said the couple\u2019s relationship was fraught with turbulence and said \u2018neither were angels.\u2019\n\nThe court heard Lee had previously hit Mr Taylor with a hammer and attacked him with a knife.\n\nShe said it came to the attention of police at the time but Mr Taylor said he had done it to himself.\n\nMs Goodwin told the court how in private Mr Taylor revealed to his friend that the person who had attacked him was Lee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued: \u2018The Crown say that the defendant was the aggressor and perpetrator of further domestic violence.\u2019\n\nThe court heard that Mr Taylor was also attacked by Lee with a hammer, in a previous incident (Picture: North News & Pictures Ltd)\n\nMs Goodwin said a shop worker described seeing Mr Taylor \u2018crying\u2019 while buying two bottles of Southern Comfort just after 9pm that night.\n\nNot long later, she said Lee walked into the same shop to buy a case of cider.\n\nThe shop worker, who described her as being in a \u2018foul mood\u2019 heard Lee shouting \u2018they better get out my flat or I\u2019ll kill them.\u2019\n\nMs Goodwin QC told the court how Lee\u2019s neighbour Margaret Mason heard the couple arguing just after 10pm and Lee shouting: \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you, I\u2019m going to kill you, I\u2019ll f***ing kill you.\u2019\n\nShe said the neighbour then heard a \u2018scuffle\u2019 take place, followed by shouts of: \u2018Paul, Paul.\u2019\n\nMs Goodwin QC told the court how Lee called the emergency services and said that Mr Taylor had \u2018stabbed himself in the chest\u2019.\n\nFace of man who lived 600 years ago recreated after skeleton found in Scotland\n\nIn the call, which was played to the jury, Lee can be heard saying: \u2018My partner is in the kitchen, he\u2019s on the floor, we have ended up having an argument and he\u2019s stabbed himself, it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s done it, the last time he smashed himself on the head with a hammer.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe goes on to tell the operator: \u2018I\u2019m sick of it, man, he does it on purpose and blames it on me.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a f***ing lunatic, I\u2019m sick of this s***.\u2019\n\nThe court heard how the police arrived to find Lee cradling Mr Taylor, who was slumped in the corner.\n\nDespite attempts by police and then paramedics to save his life, Mr Taylor was pronounced dead at 2.24am and Lee was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe court heard how she told officers: \u2018He\u2019s the love of my life. Are you for real? I never hurt him, he did it himself. He smashed himself on the head with a hammer. I knew I\u2019d get the blame sooner or later.\u2019\n\nThe court heard how, when she was charged by police on April 2, she said: \u2018I did not stab and kill my boyfriend.\u2019\n\nMs Goodwin QC told the court how Lee has a \u2018propensity to be violent\u2019 with previous convictions for criminal damage and affray.\n\nA friend of the couple told jurors he had previously heard Lee saying to Mr Taylor: \u2018I could kill you and get away with it because of my bipolar.\u2019\n\nIn a statement, Mr Taylor\u2019s family thanked friends, family and Northumbria Police for their support, and added: \u2018Now it\u2019s time for us to grieve for Paul properly and allow him to rest in\n\npeace.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Alan Cairns, said the \u2018awful incident\u2019 would \u2018live with Mr Taylor\u2019s family for the rest of their lives.\u2019\n\nLee has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at the same court on Wednesday October 30.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
