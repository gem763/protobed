This means unlike North America, Europe, Asia, or Oceania, South American populations in countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela have been pumping way more money in than out.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s plenty of additional evidence that South and Central America have been buying into Bitcoin much more than any other region.\n\nLocalBitcoins yearly volume by region, courtesy of UsefulTulips\n\nEven though the graph above suggests Europe is the region where most people are acquiring Bitcoin, by comparing how much money went in to crypto vs how much came out, we clearly reach the conclusion that that\u2019s not entirely true.\n\nSouth America has a positive balance of over $200 million, while Europe remains flat. In addition, all other regions have shown negative trends over the past year, since more people are converting Bitcoin into USD than the other way around.\n\nWill South America be the next crypto-hub?\n\nEarlier this week, Coin Rivet reported on how Brazilian courts are chasing down alleged Bitcoin pyramid scams.\n\nCoin Rivet has also recently reported on how the Brazilian central bank and regulators are keen on more people using crypto, simply because additional taxes can be collected.\n\nEven though people may think corruption is a major hurdle and bottleneck for adoption, I argue crypto will help change this behaviour. For one, it requires people to have low time preferences. Secondly, after people learn \u201cnot your keys, not your Bitcoin\u201d, they\u2019ll transfer their Bitcoin into their own private wallets.\n\nBitcoin will empower people as it gives anyone a tool to independently be their own bank and settlement provider. As fiat currencies lose purchasing power against Bitcoin, more and more people will hodl as much as possible.\n\nLocalBitcoins historical volume by region, courtesy of UsefulTulips\n\nLooking at the chart above, it seems the path to adoption has been laid out. How will government-backed fiat currencies compete with Bitcoin?\n\nI personally don\u2019t think governments will try to compete with BTC in the long term.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Mass cryptocurrency adoption can only take place if regular people feel it is safe, easy, and beneficial to join the space.
