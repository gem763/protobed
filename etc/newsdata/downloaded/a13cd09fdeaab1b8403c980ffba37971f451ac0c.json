But the gist is, classical computers are systems where problems are abstracted onto a system of two-position switches called bits (ones and zeros) that interact through the rules of logic.\n\nQuantum computers are instead based on quantum bits, or qubits, that are also two-position switches, but they interact via the same rules that subatomic particles follow, called quantum mechanics.\n\nThis quantum architecture purportedly could allow quantum computers to solve a set of problems that classical computers can\u2019t in a reasonable amount of time \u2014 this includes problems in cryptography as well as modelling molecules.\n\nBut the difficulty maintaining qubits\u2019 quantum behaviour for a usable amount of time, also called the coherence time, has prevented researchers from demonstrating any sort of quantum speedup.\n\nFinancial Times reports that they saw a Google publication claiming that the company\u2019s quantum processor can perform a calculation \u201cin three minutes and 20 seconds that would take today\u2019s most advanced classical computer, known as Summit, approximately 10,000 years\u201d \u2014 a demonstration of quantum supremacy.\n\nGoogle has not yet responded to a Gizmodo request for comment, and it has long been cagey about when and how it\u2019d make the announcement.\n\nWe don\u2019t have many details as to what calculation the computer performed. But previous proposals essentially involves the quantum computer racing classical computer simulating a random quantum circuit.\n\nThe achievement would not be a surprise \u2014 we\u2019ve long known that Google has been testing a 72-qubit device called Bristlecone with which it hoped to achieve quantum supremacy. Financial Times reports that the supremacy experiment was instead performed with a 53-qubit processor codenamed Sycamore.\n\nThis would be a major early milestone when it comes to comparing these quantum devices against classical computers. But we\u2019re a long way off before quantum computers actually demonstrate quantum usefulness.\n\nThat would require increasing the coherence time and introducing error correction schemes\u201a those where multiple qubits are combined into one in order to ensure that the quantum computer outputs the answers it\u2019s supposed to output.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s recent update on the achievement of quantum supremacy is a notable mile marker as we continue to advance the potential of quantum computing. Achieving a commercially viable quantum computer will require advancements across a number of pillars of the technology stack,\u201d James Clarke, Director of Quantum Hardware at Intel, told Gizmodo in an email.\n\nIt\u2019s possible scientists may not even accept Google\u2019s announcement as valid. Most importantly, if it takes 10,000 years for a supercomputer to check the answer a quantum computer produced, how do you know that the quantum computer got the answer right in the first place?\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you posted as we learn more about the announcement.", "description": "A Google researcher\u2019s paper claiming to have achieved quantum supremacy, a major early milestone in the field of quantum computing, appeared on a NASA website this week before being removed, Financial Times reports....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
