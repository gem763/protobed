Both of these might feel like unchangeable facts.\n\nInvestors have bet on growth over value throughout the bull market, and there are Wall Street pros who think high-growth companies will stay on top more or less permanently. But QMA, the quantitative-investment business of Prudential's $1.3 trillion PGIM division, won't be part of that group.\n\nAndrew Dyson, the chairman and CEO of QMA, wrote that over the past year and a half, investors have been rewarding weaker-performing companies and sending shares of healthier companies downward, and that this couldn't continue indefinitely.\n\n\"Expensive stocks with weaker fundamentals have delivered substantially better performance than stocks with much more attractive fundamentals and valuations,\" he said.\n\nThat might sound odd by itself, but there's a bigger surprise: Based on a two-decade analysis of Russell 1000 companies, Dyson said value companies were delivering unusually strong earnings. Their per-share earnings actually improved in 2018, and while they're down somewhat this year, it's less than normal.\n\nBut investors are simply refusing to reward the stocks for those results. Instead, Dyson said, value stocks in 2019 have endured some of their worst months since 1996 \u2014 similar to the way they were left behind during the tech bubble of the late 1990s, or the run-up to the global financial crisis.\n\nHe backed up that argument with this chart, which shows that the gap in valuations between more expensive and cheaper stocks is wide by historic standards.\n\nAndrew Dyson of QMA says the gap in valuations between the most expensive and least expensive stocks is historically large. QMA and FTSE Russell\n\nHe said value stocks righted the ship and outperformed the rest of the market during the subsequent downturns. And similarly, he said the current lag would end and that it created one of the biggest market opportunities in recent history.\n\n\"Following these extreme months in 2000 and 2009, the return to value over the next 12 months was +34% and +54%, respectively,\" he said. \"Value is on the brink of an extraordinary bounce-back.\"\n\nBen Inker, the head of asset allocation at Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo, is making a similar prediction for value stocks.\n\nCorporate insiders have been buying more company stock recently, Dyson added, and that's a sign business leaders agree with his view that a turnabout is on the way.\n\nInvestors who want to implement Dyson's ideas can use a value exchange-traded fund such as the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF.\n\nDyson cautioned against trying to time the market but said a rally in value stocks could be triggered in a number of ways: faster economic growth or a recession, an end to the trade war or other major policy questions, or new regulations that make it easier for smaller companies to compete.\n\nThat means investors should make sure they have exposure to value companies, he said. And he offers this tip for investors looking to take advantage of the turnaround when it comes:\n\n\"When the valuation spread is wide, the returns to a deeper value factor (earnings/price plus book/price) are stronger than earnings/price or an earnings/price factor blended with a growth factor (e.g., estimate revisions).\"", "description": "Andrew Dyson of QMA says value stocks are poised for a huge recovery because they're turning in solid results that investors aren't appreciating.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a87472ed03072fc098b47fc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
