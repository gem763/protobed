Is this the beginning of the end for the PC Police?\n\nWith apologies to Billy Joel, Jerry Seinfeld started the fire.\n\nIn 2015 one of comedy\u2019s cleanest stand-ups took a bold stand. He ruled out performing for college audiences.\n\nWhy? The modern campus is \u201cso PC\u201d it\u2019s no longer fun to tell jokes there, the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d superstar said.\n\n\u201c[The younger generation] just want to use these words,\u201d Seinfeld said. \u201c\u2018That\u2019s racist, that\u2019s sexist, that\u2019s prejudice.\u2019 They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nThis was before woke culture\u2019s virtual stranglehold on universities nationwide. Consider the upcoming \u201cNo Safe Spaces\u201d documentary and the satirical novel \u201cCampusland\u201d as Exhibits A and B.\n\nSeinfeld\u2019s confession caused a stir, and then some. It\u2019s what happens when a raw nerve gets exposed. Still, the woke culture shrugged off the attack, growing stronger despite Seinfeld\u2019s protests. He may have identified the problem, but he couldn\u2019t stop it from getting worse.\n\nFellow comic Dave Chappelle just picked up Seinfeld\u2019s baton, and he did so without mercy.\n\nChappelle\u2019s just-released Netflix special, \u201cSticks & Stones,\u201d directly addresses woke culture in 2019.\n\nBreitbart News captured a key sequence from the special, one already inspiring media pearl clutching. Chappelle started with a basic impression, and then he moved on to another, less obvious one.\n\n\u201cUh, Duh\u2026 Hey, der, if you do anything wrong in your life, and I find out about it, I\u2019m going to try take everything away from. I don\u2019t care what I find out. It could be today, tomorrow, fifteen, twenty years from now \u2014 If I find out, you\u2019re fucking\u2026.duh\u2026finished.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the PC scolds scouring social media posts to cancel people out \u2026 get it? It could be busy bodies looking for a social media fix, or reporters lunging for a lazy scoop.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter who does it. The offenders are merciless. And Chappelle is not a fan.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t be coming out doing comedy all the time because y\u2019all [n-word] is the worst motherf***ers I\u2019ve ever tried to entertain in my f***ing life. Goddamn sick of it. This is the worst time ever to be a celebrity. You\u2019re going to be finished, everybody\u2019s doomed!\u201d Chappelle said.\n\nTake that, Seinfeld.\n\nNaturally, one far-left media scribe savaged Chappelle\u2019s routine. Consider it an extension of their outrage following Chappelle\u2019s last Netflix special, which they deemed transphobic and worse.\n\nHere\u2019s the far-left Vice hammering Chappelle for not telling the \u2018right\u2019 kind of jokes in the new special.\n\nChappelle has always been a daredevil comedian willing to take a controversial stance or downplay a serious controversy for laughs, including his early-2000s skits about R. Kelly\u2019s court trials on Chappelle\u2019s Show. But now he chooses to blatantly ignore the historic criticism against his style of comedy[emphasis added] and new loud-and-clear criticism from the trans community.\n\nThe same outlet stood down when comedian Bill Maher cheered on the death of a libertarian mega-donor, for what it\u2019s worth. So did their media peers.\n\nBeing woke means ignoring anyone who attacks conservatives. That\u2019s how you know it\u2019s deeply dishonest.\n\nThe early reviews for \u201cSticks & Stones,\u201d even from reliably woke sites like The Daily Beast, are more measured than the Vice.com piece. Do they fear Chappelle\u2019s cultural clout? Or, more importantly, perhaps they sense all the brickbats they thew at him last time missed by a mile.\n\nRemember what Adam Carolla said about woke culture \u2013 you retreat, they encroach. Conversely, if you stand your ground the Outrage Mob quickly finds another subject.\n\nChappelle is proving that in real time.\n\nThe comic\u2019s direct attack on PC attitudes comes at a curious time. Even some liberals are growing weary of Cancel Culture, even if they\u2019re scared to say so out loud. That extends to the comedy community.\n\nFar-left comic Sarah Silverman just shared how she lost a juicy gig for a decade-old blackface routine for which she repeatedly apologized.\n\nAnd she\u2019s not happy about it.\n\nCenter-left comic Jim Gaffigan bemoaned woke culture during a heart-to-heart with podcaster Joe Rogan.\n\nChappelle left plenty of room for his peers to take the fight to the woke scolds. A comic could point out the glaring double standards tied to Cancel Culture. Pundits and comics alike can say the harshest things about First Lady Melania Trump one moment, then declare a mild jab at Hillary Clinton too sexist the next.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Netflix didn\u2019t cut ties with Chappelle following the press outrage over his last special. The streaming giant gave him another showcase. And, chances are, they\u2019ll continue their ties with the subversive comic, looking past Vice.com and its ilk.\n\nOn that level alone, Chappelle just scored a major win in the Culture Wars. Now, will his peers join the fight?", "description": "Dave Chappelle lets woke culture have it with both barrels in his newest Netflix special.
