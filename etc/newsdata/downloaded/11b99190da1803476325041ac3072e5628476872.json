When she leaves here, winning in her fourth appearance in a main draw, she will celebrate a remarkable season by breaking into the top ten.\n\nIn 11 seasons, 28-year-old Johanna Konta has beaten top-five players just seven times; since Andreescu joined the tour in 2015, she has beaten eight top-10 players in as many matches, and the results have come in a rush, interrupted by injury, over the past year.\n\nBianca Andreescu beats Serena Williams in US Open women's final \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nIf, as many good judges suspect, this is the changing of the guard, it was a privilege to witness it. It was not a great match, but it was a significant one.\n\nHistory almost weighed both of them down, but it was Andreescu, younger by nearly 19 years \u2013 the biggest age gap in a slam final in the Open era \u2013 who held steady. It was the grand dame of tennis who cracked, despite launching a brave and desperate fightback in the second set.\n\nThe very strangest look of the evening was ... the look of the 19-year-old winner. She stood alongside the 37-year-old loser (soon to be 38), as if she always expected to be receiving the plate, and there was no reason to be gobsmacked. This was her destiny. And she sounded as if she knew there would be more nights like this.\n\nOn court she was as composed as Buckingham Palace guard. Later, she cried \u2013 just like a little girl, as someone wrote \u2013 when she revealed she had seen it all unfolding long before the actual match. \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy, man. I\u2019ve been ... Sorry ... I\u2019ve been dreaming of this moment for the longest time. A couple of months after I won the Orange Bowl [in 2015], I really believed that I could be at this stage. Since then, honestly I\u2019ve been visualizing it almost every single day.\u201d\n\nFor Williams, there was dignity and resignation \u2013 in pointed contrast to the horrible scenes of a year ago, when she mentally drowned in her own tears after an unwinnable verbal war with the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos (banished from her sight now), and the ice-cool handling of the crisis by her conqueror, Naomi Osaka.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andreescu after winning her championship point. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA\n\nAsked where she was at the time, Andreescu raised a laugh when she said, \u201cI was at home. I was injured. I was sitting on my butt.\u201d And, she admitted, she doesn\u2019t think she watched it live.\n\nNow the glare shifts irresistibly away from an established legend of the game to a player who has all the qualities to become one. She is added to the cast of prodigies in the women\u2019s game being hailed as successors and saviours when Serena finally leaves the stage. They are stunningly impressive understudies, Osaka and Andreescu.\n\nIf anything, the Canadian has the edge. After Osaka won here and went on to add the Australian Open, she had bewildering dips and flights of fortune, complicated by injury, and repeatedly gave the impression she did not know what direction she was going in. She sacked her coach after winning two slams on the spin. That\u2019s weird. But she is also delightful, and hugely talented. Theirs will be a rivalry to cherish.\n\nAndreescu has capped a year that has also endured injury interruptions in the most spectacular fashion, the first Canadian to win a major.\n\nRafael Nadal wary of in-form Daniil Medvedev in race for ultimate prize | Kevin Mitchell Read more\n\nNow people are comparing her to Williams, who has ruled the game most of the time since she won her first slam here in 1999 and stands tantalisingly one short of the all-time record of 24 majors held by Margaret Court.\n\nAndreescu sees the similarities \u2013 and the differences.\n\n\u201cWe [both] like to keep the points short with our aggressive game style. We like to use our serve to our advantage. I think we fight really, really hard. But, at the same time I want to make a name for myself. I know I have a different game style to many players on the tour right now. It\u2019s been working really, really well. It\u2019s been working to my advantage. I just want to keep improving it.\u201d\n\nWilliams sees it, too. \u201cWe\u2019re really similar in that we both are fighters and we both are really intense. I feel like we both enjoy what we do, but at the same time \u2013 it\u2019s hard to describe \u2013 super intense with what we do.\u201d\n\nLike Williams, Andreescu hits the ball with such power and certainty that opponents are mentally waiting for something impossible to handle. Her serve is big, but occasionally unreliable under pressure \u2013 as when she lost four games in a row in the second set. But she trusts her talent.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Serena Williams congratulates Bianca Andreescu at the end of the match. Photograph: Adam Hunger/AP\n\nHer attitude and demeanour in some matches has been volatile \u2013 but not here when it mattered most. There were no outbursts, not arguments, no reason to see she was reacting to pressure rather than creating it. She was doing what Williams has done for two decades when at the top of her game.\n\nAnd, after losing four slam finals in her comeback after becoming a mother for the first time in 2017, Williams recognises that her dominance is not what it was. It would be remarkable if it were.\n\nAs she conceded later, \u201cI felt like I could have done so many things a little bit better. But she played really well, and she deserves this championship. Today I thought she brought more intensity than versatility. I didn\u2019t give her too much opportunity to have versatility. I love Bianca. I think she\u2019s a great girl. But I think this was the worst match I\u2019ve played all tournament.\u201d\n\nAs for the Court record, Williams is trying her best to downplay the attention it has rightly attracted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily chasing a record,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to win grand slams. It\u2019s definitely frustrating. But, for the most part, I just am still here. I\u2019m still doing what I can do.\u201d\n\nThe game will miss her when she\u2019s gone, an adornment to stubbornness, a proper queen of the court, regally brilliant at her best and most relaxed. It is her challenge to rediscover those qualities in the autumn of her career.", "description": "Bianca Andreescu has become Canada\u2019s first grand slam champion of the open era, beating Serena Williams 6-3, 7-5", "authors": ["Kevin Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a4be183b04a0c1f1d5b30d6b2be8df272c400b/0_42_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3061a19f8d1e00a6a84b6fe94d188154", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
