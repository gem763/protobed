That is worse reading of the Trump presidency.\n\nThe index fell in June and July but had rebounded in August. The September data, while not suggesting a looming recession, does indicate that growth is slowing in the U.S. economy. It follows an earlier report from ISM indicating activity contracted in the manufacturing sector.\n\nReadings above 50 indicate activity is expanding, while those below 50 are a sign of contraction.\n\nAll the components of the index remain in positive territory apart from imports. The most closely watched components\u2013production, employment, and new orders\u2013showed ongoing expansion, albeit at a slower pace than earlier. New export orders for services actually improved for the month.\n\nThe worse-than-expected manufacturing index released on Tuesday has sparked fears that the U.S. economy could be slowing more than expected, dragged down by sluggish growth around the world. Thursday\u2019s report on the non-manufacturing segment of the economy will not fan the flames of recession fears but neither does it put out the blaze.\n\nAll eyes will now turn to Friday\u2019s report on nonfarm employment for indications of whether the labor market\u2019s strength, which is supporting the strong consumer spending that has become critical to the buoyancy of the U.S. economy, has tapered off.", "description": "The ISM non-manufacturing survey came in lower than expected but still above contraction levels. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/fourth-of-july-parade-california-filephoto-american-flags-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
