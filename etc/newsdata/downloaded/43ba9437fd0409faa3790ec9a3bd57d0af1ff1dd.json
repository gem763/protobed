The second is that BHP\u2019s initiative is the most meaningful product so far of The Green Corridor joint venture that has seen Woodside, BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals working in partnership to develop a design for LNG-fuelled bulk carriers capable of running iron ore to Asia.\n\nGreen Corridor is an initiative in emissions mitigation made compelling by the International Maritime Organisation\u2019s decision in 2016 to set a January 2020 date for a requirement that global shipping either move to lower-sulphur fuels or invest a bigger fortune in scrubbing technologies to contain exhaust fumes.\n\nOn Monday, BHP\u2019s head of procurement, Sandeep Singh, reminded an audience at the IMARC conference in Melbourne of the weight of shipping\u2019s contribution to global greenhouse emissions.\n\n\u201cIf shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest emitter of CO2 in the world, with more emissions than Germany or Canada,\u201d he said, reiterating BHP\u2019s commitment to find LNG-powered ships enough to carry 27mt per annum of iron ore northwards.\n\nWith a detail that only a procurement guru might acquire, Singh captured the quality of shipping's contribution to BHP's emissions dilemma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOcean freight is one area at the very end of our industry\u2019s supply chain that hasn\u2019t traditionally been a focus from a sustainability perspective that is vital to our success as a reliable global supplier,\u201d he said.\n\n\"The combined distance these ships travel is the equivalent of 29 trips to the moon!\u201d\n\n\u201cBHP is one of the largest dry bulk charterers in the world. The Commercial Maritime team procure freight for a quarter of a billion tonnes of iron ore, coal and copper and over 1500 voyages each year. The combined distance these ships travel is the equivalent of 29 trips to the moon!\u201d\n\nSingh said LNG-fuelled boats eliminate the nitrogen and sulphur emissions released by burning traditional bunker fuels and would significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nPresently, those emissions land in BHP's scope 3 account. Needless to say then, this tender was a practical anticipation of the commitments that chief executive Andrew Mackenzie made in August to actively assist customers seeking solutions to the greenhouse emissions release when they use BHP\u2019s products.\n\nBlindingly obvious\n\nBack in July, just after news of BHP\u2019s tender, Woodside\u2019s chief operating officer, Meg O\u2019Neill, quantified what the ultimate success of the Green Corridor initiative might look like, proclaiming the potential of LNG as a transport fuel was vast, while assessing it \u201cblindingly obvious\u201d this was a new market that ought be owned by Western Australia.\n\n\u201cIf all shipping from the Pilbara transitioned to LNG, it would be around 4 million tonnes [annually] of LNG fuelling,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put that into context, that is equal to the low end of the targeted production for the new LNG train that Woodside has planned to add to its Pluto project.\n\n\u201cI have been asked recently if our Burrup Hub growth strategy is contingent on the market for LNG fuels taking off,\u201d O\u2019Neill continued. \u201cIt is not,\u201d she assured, before nominating a material future in transport fuel as a \u201ccherry on top\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s a blindingly obvious market for WA to try to capture with the potential for a whole new industry and the jobs and investment that brings. And now is the time to be going after that opportunity.\u201d\n\nAIE delivers as promised\n\nMind you, the geography of that opportunity is not limited to the west. The future needs of LNG-powered bulk carriers is one of the add-on opportunities identified by proposed east coast LNG importer, Australian Industrial Energy (AIE).\n\nAIE is, of course, half-owned by Fortescue\u2019s founder, major owner and chairman, Andrew Forrest. I make that point only because, for the moment, AIE seems more interested in the potential of LNG ships than its owner.\n\nIn response to a question at Tuesday\u2019s Fortescue annual general meeting on whether LNG was a fuel of choice for a cleaner bulk carrier future, the great man said: \u201cIf we had a choice it would be low sulphur fuel, then gas. But ultimately we want to get to hydrogen fuel.\u201d\n\nJust on the subject of AIE, it has made good on a report carried first in The Australian Financial Review that it wanted to nearly double the capacity of the LNG regasification facility it wants to park in Port Kembla\u2019s inner harbour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wannabe gas importers have lodged an application with the NSW government seeking to lift the ceiling in shipments from 26 shipments annually to 46. According to my calculator, that implies an increase in annualised capacity from 100 petajoules to nearly 180/PJ.\n\nThankfully, it appears that AIE\u2019s request for modification of the consent offered earlier this year will again avoid the maze-turned-quagmire that is the state\u2019s Independent Planning Commission.\n\nBecause AIE\u2019s project was deemed Critical State Significant Infrastructure (CSSI), a decision on its progress can only be made by the Minister for Planning. And that means requests for modifications to a consent already made must also be approved by the minister.\n\nAustralia's grumpiest gas customer\n\nNow, we cannot leave the subject of gas without observing that Incitec Pivot and Central Petroleum have pushed the accelerator in plans to turn Australia\u2019s grumpiest gas customer into a producer.\n\nIn March last year the pair, who already have a long history of productive symbiosis in gas, were gifted an unreleased sweet spot in the heartland of Queensland\u2019s coal seam gas by a state government determined to invite competition and new supply to the east coast gas market.\n\nA four-well drill program conducted in July and August delivered a contingent gas resource of 270/PJ, and Central confirmed on Tuesday that the joint venture would proceed immediately to an appraisal pilot program and that they were working to accelerate their way to a final investment decision.\n\nThat acceleration could see early orders made for long-lead time items ahead of FID and in parallel with pre-FID work, which includes securing approvals and completing environmental studies.\n\nCentral says it is now targeting first gas in 2022. As things stand, half of any production is available for contest by east coast gas consumers, while the balance will be directed to Incitec at a price equivalent to the project\u2019s cost of production.\n\nAnd that prospect should come as an enormous relief to a gas sector that would gladly never again have to entertain a contract negotiation with Incitec\u2019s hard-charging boss, Jeanne Johns.", "description": "If shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest emitter of CO2 in the world, according to BHP which is about to announce its first LNG-powered ship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/767ece7fa3a1fedff3225328870bf5388d9029dd", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
