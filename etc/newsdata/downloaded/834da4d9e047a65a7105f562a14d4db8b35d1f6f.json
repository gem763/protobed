In a Friday appearance on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d Burnett said that coming to terms with her authentic self in the public eye was a \u201creally scary\u201d experience.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fear. It was fear of judgement,\u201d the Texas native, who is bisexual, said. \u201cIt was fear of disappointing people in my life, making them uncomfortable. It was just really hard ... But it all worked out.\u201d\n\nIn the early episodes of this season of \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d Burnett began dating contestant Derek Peth. As the season progressed, however, Burnett told Peth that she and Haggerty, who was not previously involved in the franchise, had been dating casually before filming commenced.\n\n\u201cObviously, in the beginning, I was just hesitant to get to know him because of the situation,\u201d Burnett told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cBut everything he\u2019s done, it just speaks so highly of his character and I do wish the best for him. We\u2019re all friends, so it\u2019s a unique situation, but it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nHer experience on the show, she later told People, had taught her that \u201cit\u2019s OK to be myself and embrace that and own it.\u201d", "description": "Appearing on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" the 23-year-old opened up about being part of the first LGBTQ couple in the American \"Bachelor\" franchise.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8551532100002f00e5cd99.jpeg?cache=qcbmh15ixf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
