It\u2019s even more unusual for a suspected spy and defector to be living abroad using his own name.\n\nPublic records show two addresses for an Oleg Smolenkov. One is a six-bedroom house on three acres in Stafford, Va., and the other is the Russian Embassy in Northwest Washington.\n\nDiplomatic records show that Smolenkov worked as a \u201csecond secretary\u201d in the embassy from at least 2006 until 2008. He appears to have received a traffic citation in 2006 in Arlington.\n\nU.S. got key asset out of Russia following election hacking\n\nSenior Russian diplomats would be coveted spies for the United States. And Smolenkov rose through the Russian diplomatic ranks after his tour in Washington.\n\nHe worked for Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Yuri Ushakov, who served as Russia's envoy to the United States from 1999 to 2008. Back in Moscow, Smolenkov was an aide to Ushakov, who has been at Putin's side for years. The former ambassador served as Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser and when Putin became prime minister in 2008 and stayed with him when Putin became president in 2012, according to published reports.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as close to Putin as you can get with respect to foreign policy matters and especially the United States,\u201d said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow who knew Ushakov well. \u201cHe was ambassador for 10 years in Washington. So he\u2019s highly regarded as their country\u2019s expert on America,\u201d and is in every meeting Putin has with a head of state, McFaul said.\n\nIt is not clear that Smolenkov is the source who provided the United States with details on Russia\u2019s election interference. But he was almost certainly a valuable CIA asset, according to current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment.\n\nThe asset who informed on Putin worked for the CIA for more than 10 years and was taken out of Russia around May or June of 2017, current and former officials said.\n\nWashington Post reporter Bob Woodward wrote in his 2018 book \u201cFear\u201d that the CIA felt its source \u201cwas in such jeopardy\u201d that the agency wanted to move the person to another country. \u201cThe source refused to leave, apparently out of fear of repercussions against the person\u2019s family if the source suddenly left Russia or disappeared,\u201d Woodward wrote.\n\nObama\u2019s secret struggle to punish Russia for Putin\u2019s election assault\n\nA neighbor who lives across the street from the Smolenkovs said that the family had moved into the neighborhood earlier this year. He said that Smolenkov, his wife and children left on Monday evening and hadn\u2019t returned.\n\nWhen a Post reporter went to the house Tuesday morning, it appeared unoccupied, save for two black cane corsos, an Italian dog breed sometimes trained as guards. Thick drapes were drawn across the windows on the house\u2019s lower level.\n\nThe family seems to have left in a hurry. Behind the house, toys and clothing were strewn about the yard. A woman\u2019s sweatshirt lay draped over a patio chair. A full ashtray and two lighters were on the patio table.\n\nOne neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said that Smolenkov didn\u2019t have a job. After moving in earlier this year, Smolenkov said that he looked forward to tending the house\u2019s ample lawn and gardens, the neighbor said.\n\n\u201cHe said he had a lot of time on his hands,\u201d the neighbor said.\n\nThere was no answer at a cellphone number listed for Smolenkov.\n\nDeclassified report says Putin \u2018ordered\u2019 effort to undermine faith in U.S. election and help Trump\n\nIntelligence experts were baffled that reporters were able to so quickly glean information about a potentially high-level CIA asset.\n\nJoseph Augustyn, a former senior CIA officer who ran the agency\u2019s National Resettlement Operations Center from 1999 to 2001, said it \u201cboggles my mind\u201d that Smolenkov would be living in the United States under his real name. \u201cThat said,\u201d he added, \u201cwe respect the wishes of the particular defector.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see him saying, \u2018Well, I want to live as normal a life as possible. I don\u2019t want to assume a new name, make it difficult on my wife and kids,\u2019 \u201d Augustyn said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the agency would recommend.\u201d\n\nAnother former senior CIA official said the agency discourages defectors from using their real names or living near the nation\u2019s capital, where Russian intelligence services have an extensive presence. In most cases, \u201cyou come up with a completely new identity and legend, and you want to get the guy out to Colorado\u201d or somewhere similarly outside the Beltway, said the former official, who handled numerous defectors and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss CIA procedures.\n\nThere have been exceptions, typically in cases when the United States and Russia have swapped spies \u2014 trading operatives who had been caught engaged in espionage with the tacit understanding that they would not be targeted after the transaction. There is no known evidence of such an arrangement in this case. If a swap occurred in Montenegro \u2014 where the suspected spy supposedly disappeared in 2017 \u2014 the cover story of a family disappearance might have been concocted by the Kremlin to obscure the departure of a former official.\n\nFormer senior intelligence officials said that Putin doubtless knew that Kommersant, the Russian newspaper, was publishing Smolenkov\u2019s name. Why do that? \u201cIf I\u2019m speculating,\u201d McFaul said, \u201cthis is obviously to intimidate him and scare him.\u2019\u2019\n\nRussia has a long history of targeting former spies and dissidents abroad, most recently last year when operatives tried to assassinate kill former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in England using a deadly nerve agent.\n\nSo far, Moscow has not carried out killings in the United States.\n\nAugustyn said there are \u201cseveral hundred\u201d defectors now living in the United States, coming from countries such as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.\n\n\u201cAt the CIA, our responsibility is to our asset,\u201d he said. \u201cOur responsibility is to make sure that they remain safe, and when it looks like it\u2019s time to bring somebody out, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nWill Englund in Moscow, Julie Tate and Greg Miller contributed to this report.", "description": "The man and his family appear to have abruptly left their home outside of Washington.", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "Ellen Nakashima"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NPCBJ2WUEAI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
