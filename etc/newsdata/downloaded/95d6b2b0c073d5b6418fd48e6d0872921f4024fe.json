There is clearly an enthusiasm gap around the program, now 0-2 and facing down the barrels of one of the best teams in the nation on Saturday night at the Rose Bowl.\n\nNo. 5 Oklahoma visits UCLA this Saturday and there is hardly any buzz around the game. So the program, in its second season under Chip Kelly and still struggling, is offering fans who attended last week\u2019s 23-14 home opener loss to San Diego State the chance to score four free tickets.\n\nFans and boosters are clearly down on this program. Even the heralded Kelly hasn\u2019t provided a spark. The Bruins went 3-9 last season in his first year with the program. An 0-2 start this year doesn\u2019t inspire confidence or create much enthusiasm, especially as the program faces a potential blowout loss in the third week of the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttendance for last weekend\u2019s home opener was announced as 36,951. That isn\u2019t necessarily poor except that UCLA plays in the historic Rose Bowl, a facility with a capacity is 90,088. The place was empty.\n\nAnd given the team\u2019s less-than-inspiring start, attendance could be down even further for the Oklahoma game.\n\nThe Sooners are coming into the weekend\u2019s trip to Los Angeles with momentum. They convincingly beat a very good Houston team and then took care of business last weekend against South Dakota State. Oklahoma has legitimate national championship ambitions and will be expected to take care of the Bruins.\n\nOklahoma also notoriously travels well as a program, making it entirely possible that the Rose Bowl will be dominated Sunday night on the field and in the stands by Oklahoma.\n\nA spokesman from Oklahoma said that the program sold out their allotment of 4,000 tickets for the game. Given the way that the Sooners faithful travel, however, the number at the Rose Bowl will likely swell beyond that official total.", "description": "UCLA football's poor start has the athletics department to offer free tickets for Saturday's game against No. 5 Oklahoma.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/11/0/0/UCLA20UA.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
