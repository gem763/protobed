Here are their stories:\n\n\u2013 \u2018I eat if I\u2019m given something\u2019 \u2013\n\nSoledad Sanchez is a mother of seven children aged two to 19. At 36, she is already a grandmother. She lives near the famed Teatro Colon opera house in Buenos Aires \u2014 but her life is nothing like its gilded halls.\n\nBy day, she sits in front of a supermarket. At night, she tries to sleep in an enclosure housing a bank ATM.\n\n\u201cI eat if I\u2019m given something. If I don\u2019t get anything, I don\u2019t eat,\u201d Sanchez says.\n\nUntil February 2018, the salary of her husband \u2014 a trash sorter \u2014 combined with public assistance allowed the family to pay for lodging.\n\nWhen they lost their benefits, her husband took his own life.\n\n\u201cHe killed himself because of the situation we found ourselves in. They were threatening to take our kids away if we did not leave our hotel room. So one Friday, at 3 pm, he set himself on fire,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBefore that, I had enough to get by, to put a roof over my children\u2019s heads. I could bathe them and feed them. How we live now, this isn\u2019t a life,\u201d she adds, cradling her six-year-old daughter.\n\nThe little girl no longer goes to school \u2014 her supplies were stolen. Sanchez\u2019s other daughter, who is 15 and disabled, sits on the corner nearby.\n\nThe other children, Sanchez says with pride, are at school: \u201cI send them to school so that someday they can be someone \u2014 not like me.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Despair\u2019 \u2013\n\nFour years ago, 37-year-old Jose Rivero arrived in Argentina\u2019s capital from Salta province in the north.\n\nHe didn\u2019t have formal work, but he says he has always managed \u201cto create a job when there wasn\u2019t one.\u201d\n\nJust three months ago, Rivero was recycling items collected at a market to scrape by. But now, he wanders around all day. At night he sleeps in a homeless shelter.\n\n\u201cI have nothing left,\u201d he says.\n\nSome days, he earns about $3 selling coffee and sandwiches outside a hospital.\n\n\u201cYou can feel a lot of despair in the streets,\u201d Rivero says. Despite everything, he still has dreams.\n\n\u201cI came here from Salta hoping to pick myself up. For now, I won\u2019t admit defeat.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Cold, hard reality \u2013\n\nAfter more than a decade of being homeless, 60-year-old painter Francisco Niubo has given up hope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to accept this crappy reality, and no longer dream of things that one can\u2019t have,\u201d he says.\n\nDuring daylight hours, Niubo walks around the city with a case containing his brushes and paints.\n\nHe hopes to find work decorating a store window or making a sign \u2014 but it\u2019s rare.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, if you didn\u2019t get invited for a coffee, you at least got a soda, beer or a sandwich. Now, people don\u2019t have anything to eat, so they are less likely to offer me work to do,\u201d Niubo says.\n\n\u201cBefore, we used to say, \u2018God help me\u2019 but now, it\u2019s like He took a vacation, because we are all starving.\u201d", "description": "Buenos Aires (AFP) \u2013 The streets of Buenos Aires offer a glimpse at how the worst economic crisis to hit Argentina in nearly two decades \u2014 a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/3df4ba_soledad-sanchez-has-children-now-sleeps-in-enclosed-entryway-protecting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
