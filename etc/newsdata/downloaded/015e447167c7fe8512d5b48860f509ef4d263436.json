Let\u2019s stay focused on why the Republican Party needs to win in November.\n\nAccording to U.S. Census Bureau figures, recent evidence suggests that the income inequality between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year grew to its highest level in more than 50 years. Contrary to what Democrats would have you believe, that is great news! People who are finding better jobs, being promoted into more responsible positions, and earning more profit in an expanding economy are leaving behind the people who settle for staying in dead-end jobs and depending upon government subsidies.\n\nTo keep citizens on the government dependency plantation, Democrats preach learned helplessness\u2014there is nothing you can do to make a difference, so don\u2019t even try. Their only hope is to depend on government subsidies at the expense of their more successful neighbors.\n\nTo justify their drive for power and the need for their dependency-creating entitlements, they\u2019re doing everything they can to squash the American Dream for this and future generations. Leftist candidates would have you believe that The Dream is dead and out of the reach for today\u2019s average citizen, justifying their wealth redistribution and expanded entitlement programs.\n\nThey want you to believe that America is \u201cbroken\u201d and you are incapable of picking yourself up by your own bootstraps. They want you to believe that the wealthy don\u2019t pay their \u201cfair share,\u201d in spite of the fact that the top 1% of wage earners pay 37.32% of federal income taxes and the bottom 50% only 3.04%.\n\nThey are mistaken. The American Dream is still alive for those willing to apply themselves. Yes, the gap between those in the top 1% and those in poverty has grown, but a closer look at longitudinal income mobility research indicates that the people who make up the \"rich\" and the \"poor\" change. Americans still move up and move down the income slide.\n\nA 1995 study reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas followed 3,725 currently \"poor\" citizens for 17 years. To generalize from the study, only 1 out of 20 \"poor\" Americans remained poor. Thirteen percent had become \"middle class,\" and six had become \"rich,\" defined by reaching the top 20% of income producers.\n\nIn a U.S. Treasury study on income mobility from 1996 to 2005, we find evidence that there is no permanent membership in the upper-class or the under-class. Those with very high incomes in 1996--the top 1 percent--had their incomes cut in half by 2005. Many \"rich\" lost substantial income. Those trying to aspire to become rich\u2014those in the top 20%--on average, increased their income ten percent. Those originally in the bottom 20 percent saw a 91 percent increase in income. In fact, roughly half of them increased their income right out of poverty! Unfortunately, since others lose jobs or fail in their business efforts, people move down into \u201cpoverty\u201d to take their place. The large gap is still there but the people who populate the groups keep changing.\n\nAn expanded analysis of income mobility reveals some amazing findings. Cornell\u2019s Thomas Hirschl looked at 44 years of longitudinal data to see what percentage of Americans experience different levels of affluence during their lives. He found that 12 percent of the population would experience being in the top 1 percent of income distribution for at least one year, 39 percent would spend a year in the top 5 percent. An impressive 73 percent will spend at least a year in the top 20 percent. From all the studies, it\u2019s clear there is no static income distribution. It is equally true that on the bottom end of the distribution scale, 54 percent of Americans will experience poverty or near poverty at least once between the ages of 25 and 60.\n\nIt's time we focus on achievers who are still innovating, working hard and proving that the American Dream can work...one dream at a time. For every victim the liberals talk about to justify bigger government and more entitlement programs, conservatives should honor a survivor\u2014an individual who found a way to overcome obstacles to achieve their dream. Let their stories inspire and teach others to do the same.\n\nIt's not government that makes America strong. It's our free, hard-working people that ensure our future and give our nation its strength. President Trump has again proven what conservative principles preach. When you stop punishing the productive and enslaving the dependent in programs that keep them trapped in poverty, Americans will find a way to succeed. Cut spending, cut taxes, cut regulations, and unleash the America Dream to take on the world. If we do, America will keep winning.\n\nDemocrats continue to sell low expectations to a new generation of Americans. They sell \u201cyou can\u2019t,\u201d while President Trump sells \u201cyou can.\u201d There are jobs out there. There are entrepreneurs with innovations just waiting to be launched.\n\nRonald Reagan, when asked the secret for his success as president, said,\u201cI appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears, to your confidence, rather than your doubts.\u201d Donald Trump is doing that again and the economy continues to prove that the American Dream is still very much alive.
