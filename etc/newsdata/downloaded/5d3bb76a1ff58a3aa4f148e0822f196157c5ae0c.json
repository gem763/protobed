The overall PMI services index rose by less than expected but still indicated expansion.\n\n\"The survey indicates that businesses continue to struggle against the headwinds of trade worries and elevated uncertainty about the outlook,\" said Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, adding, \"Firms have become more risk averse and increasingly eager to cut costs.\"\n\nThe IHS Markit survey showed stabilization in factory activity, which had dipped into a recession this year.
