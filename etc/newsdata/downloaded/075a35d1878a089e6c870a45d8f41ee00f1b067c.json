My husband and I are having a difficult time agreeing on exactly how much we should set aside for emergencies. How do you determine the exact amount?\n\nErin\n\nDear Erin,\n\nThe exact you amount you have in your emergency fund\u2014whether it\u2019s three, four, five, or six months of expenses\u2014is really more about peace of mind than anything else. Still, there are a few practical things to consider.\n\nIf you both have very stable jobs, you\u2019d probably be okay saving three or four months of expenses. But if one of you is self-employed, makes most of their money through commissions, or only one of you works outside the home, it would make more sense to have five or six months of expenses set aside.\n\nOf course, you can always compromise while leaving room for growth. There\u2019s nothing wrong starting out with three months of expenses saved, then adding more as time goes by. The main thing is that you\u2019re both in agreement, and you both feel safe with the amount of money in your emergency fund!\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,I know you talk about having an emergency fund .10/01/2019 11:22:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/263/f3f188be-8843-4a63-a968-b9c8b16bd0c2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
