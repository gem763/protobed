Who pays for everything? Do you really have to give everyone a plus one?\n\nOne tradition which you would be very brave to ignore is not to wear white as a guest through fear of upstaging the bride and ruining her day.\n\nTo avoid any chance of being out-shone, it seems one bride has come up with a plan to ensure there is no doubt over exactly whose big day it is.\n\nA photo of her four bridesmaids shows them to be wearing shiny, black dresses, which were posted on Reddit - where the look was quickly compared to bin bags.\n\nEach also has a pair of trainers of varying colours poking out the bottom to complete the look.\n\nAs they pose for the snap, two of the bridesmaids are shown to have their hands in the pockets of the dress, which one commenter describes as 'the only redeemable thing I can see here'.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nWhile some were keen to point out they see no problem with the outfits, others were less restrained in airing their views on the post captioned 'I didn't know Hefty (a bin bag manufacturer) made a bridal line'.\n\n\"I have many questions about this photo - what the hell are they wearing on their body and feet?\" asked one.\n\nAnother said: \"Thanks to you guys, this was the sweatiest wedding ever.\"\n\nA third added: \"Well, Hefty makes trash bags so the title implies the dresses look like black, plastic bin liners. The title is not wrong.\"\n\nDo you have a wedding nightmare story?
