Keep checking back this week for more sweet content.\n\nWhen \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d nabbed the Oscar for Best Picture in March 2000, its win seemed forward-thinking. The movie \u201cdealt with sex and drugs, blackmail, homophobia, infidelity and suburban dysfunction,\u201d producer Dan Jinks proclaimed during his acceptance speech. \u201cAnd in the middle of all this was a character named Ricky Fitts, who at one point says, \u2018Sometimes there\u2019s so much beauty in the world I feel like I can\u2019t take it,\u2019 and everyone in the audience knew exactly what he meant.\u201d\n\nFor the better part of two decades, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had mostly handed its top prize to traditional period pieces with a sweeping dramatic scale: \u201cChariots of Fire,\u201d \u201cGandhi,\u201d \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d \u201cTitanic,\u201d the list goes on. But \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d? That was different. A satire about contemporary domesticity that ended with a bitter gunshot didn\u2019t offer the same uplift as, say, \u201cForrest Gump\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d Its rose petals were spiked with thorns, an apt reflection of the country\u2019s ethos after Y2K paranoia and the Columbine shootings.\n\nOh, how the mighty fall.\n\nToday, \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d is, by and large, seen as anything but forward-thinking. In the 20 years since it debuted to rapturous reviews and a global $356 million intake, the film\u2019s reputation has tumbled precipitously. What was once a provocative masterstroke now looks like retrograde hooey. Plenty of classics undergo cultural reappraisals as time amends our ideas about what constitutes valuable storytelling, but few have turned into such a widespread punchline.\n\nHow \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d declined is complex, and why it declined will vary based on whose perspective you hear. That\u2019s often the case when something\u2019s prestige shifts without a common denominator to unite the so-called backlash. But this isn\u2019t a routine example of internet hot takes demanding retroactive wokeness, even if the movie raises questionable suggestions about pedophilia, queerness and violence. Nor we can lay the about-face at Kevin Spacey\u2019s feet, even though the actor\u2019s numerous sexual assault allegations color how one might see his character\u2019s rapey proclivities.\n\nIf we look closer, as the movie\u2019s tagline requests, apprehension around \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d set in fairly quickly, through parodies and national tragedies and many a late-night joke.\n\n\u2015\u2015\n\n\u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d is the story of Lester Burnham (Spacey), an affluent magazine executive fed up with his corporate career and sexless marriage to an image-conscious real estate agent (Annette Bening). Cue the midlife crisis. Lester quits his job, buys his dream car and develops an infatuation with his teenage daughter\u2019s (Thora Birch) blond cheerleader friend (Mena Suvari) \u2014 textbook man-child conduct. Meanwhile, the Burnhams\u2019 new neighbors are a repressed family led by retired Marine Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), whose wife (Allison Janney) is nearly catatonic and whose aforementioned son (Wes Bentley) is a brooding, voyeuristic weed dealer. As their lives intersect, melodrama unfolds.\n\nAlan Ball, who\u2019d written for the sitcoms \u201cGrace Under Fire\u201d and \u201cCybill,\u201d found inspiration for his screenplay in the Amy Fisher scandal, a plastic bag he\u2019d seen blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center, the six-feet-under narration from \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d and his experiences growing up in residential Georgia. DreamWorks, co-founded in 1994 by Steven Spielberg, bought Ball\u2019s script in April 1998 after a bidding war with rival studios, giving the project instant clout. At the time, Hollywood was drunk on tart suburban satires about white America, from \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d and \u201cSerial Mom\u201d to \u201cPleasantville,\u201d \u201cThe Ice Storm\u201d and \u201cThe Truman Show.\u201d The following December, cameras were rolling \u2014 a fast turnaround by industry standards. First-time film director Sam Mendes, who had recently won acclaim for his Broadway revival of \u201cCabaret,\u201d sat at the helm.\n\nBy the time \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d premiered in September 1999 at the Toronto International Film Festival \u2014 a key awards-season springboard \u2014 the buzz was electric. This was the hot property of the fall, and DreamWorks kept the momentum alive by releasing it in theaters the next month, when it could still ride the festival wave. Worried such dark subject matter wouldn\u2019t play well in heartland malls, the studio initially expected the movie to hit 700 screens. (For comparison, \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d released two months earlier, maxed out at approximately 2,800.) But \u201cBeauty\u201d exceeded expectations, climbing to more than 1,500 screens and cementing a position as the year\u2019s Oscar front-runner.\n\nMost critics gushed over the film, rightly praising Mendes\u2019 sleek pacing and Thomas Newman\u2019s hypnotic score, among other hallmarks. But in revisiting those reviews from the more socially enlightened vantage of 2019, it\u2019s striking how few challenged its dodgy ideas about gender, class and sexuality, given that \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d would hardly survive the think-piece cycle that now monopolizes pop culture.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the Angela Hayes of it all. Angela is the Suvari character, introduced through a gymnasium pom-pom routine that morphs into 42-year-old Lester\u2019s sick fantasy: a striptease ending with rose petals flowing from her chest. Multiple reviews likened Angela to Lolita \u2014 she of the famed Vladimir Nabokov novel, told from the voice of an unreliable narrator persuing the titular 12-year-old \u2014 but they didn\u2019t treat Lester\u2019s lust as anything more than a personal dilemma. In practice, Angela\u2019s supposed sex appeal galvanizes Lester\u2019s midlife crisis, becoming a device mined for both humor and sensuality. He starts pumping iron to impress her and seeking out juvenile luxuries that defy his wife\u2019s best interest. \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d doesn\u2019t endorse Lester\u2019s behavior, but it also doesn\u2019t shy away from eroticizing Angela in the name of character development.\n\n\u201cIs it wrong for a man in his 40s to lust after a teenage girl?\u201d Roger Ebert wrote. \u201cAny honest man understands what a complicated question this is. Wrong morally, certainly, and legally. But as every woman knows, men are born with wiring that goes directly from their eyes to their genitals, bypassing the higher centers of thought. They can disapprove of their thoughts, but they cannot stop themselves from having them.\u201d\n\nThen, there\u2019s Frank Fitts. Presented as a virulent homophobe who fetishizes guns, Frank is revealed at the 11th hour \u2014 following a series of misunderstandings that Ebert likened to a \u201cscrewball comedy\u201d \u2014 to be a closeted gay man. (Ball, who is openly gay, created Frank out of suspicions that his own father was suppressing his homosexuality.)\n\nThe denouement of \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d hinges on this plot twist. Frank, who falsely assumed Lester was having sex with his son, Ricky, attempts to kiss Lester during a rainstorm, only to be rebuffed. Rattled, Lester then decides not to sleep with Angela, a gambit that\u2019s meant to redeem him. When Angela reveals she\u2019s a virgin, he finally sees her as a child instead of a carnal object. She is, in other words, a Freudian tool for a middle-aged loser\u2019s self-discovery. Glimpsing a photo of his family nearby, Lester finally realizes that his life is actually pretty swell.\n\nBut Frank, reveling in his late-breaking self-hatred, sneaks in and kills Lester. All of Lester\u2019s supposed growth was for naught.\n\nHardly anyone has sorted out their problems, yet Lester ends the film with pseudo-enlightenment from the afterlife. \u201cI guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it\u2019s hard to stay mad when there\u2019s so much beauty in the world,\u201d he coos.\n\n\u2015\u2015\n\nBall and Mendes were attempting to criticize the materialistic facades that upper-class Americans adopt to preserve manicured reputations. But their ideas about overcoming pedophilia are reductive, and their treatment of gayness as a fatal revelation underlines how much \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d is a product of its time.\n\nEven with a bushel of Oscars, including trophies for Ball and Spacey, it quickly became evident that some of the movie\u2019s intended commentary ran skin-deep.\n\nIn April 2000, the viewer-voted MTV Movie Awards nominated Spacey and Suvari for Best Kiss, apparently paying no mind to the icky implications of said kiss. Even DreamWorks knew it was a step too far. The studio declined to provide a corresponding clip for the broadcast, not wanting to glorify a plot point that \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d sought to condemn. MTV subsequently revoked the nomination. (Tellingly, the network\u2019s viewers had nominated a \u201cLolita\u201d adaptation in the same category the previous year.)\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to declare the MTV Movie Awards, of all things, the source of the film\u2019s lapse, but it\u2019s as good a place as any to start. From there, we seemed to gradually accept \u2014 to the nebulous extent that any piece of wisdom in a mass-media society can be universal \u2014 that \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d was pretentious, misguided or worse.\n\nA more robust audit landed in 2001, when \u201cFamily Guy\u201d parodied \u201cBeauty\u201d twice during the same season. In one episode, the patriarch Peter is capturing his son with a camcorder when he\u2019s suddenly beguiled by a plastic bag fluttering in the breeze, much like the one Ricky films and obsesses over. Echoing Ricky\u2019s words, Peter says, faux-poetically, \u201cThere\u2019s so much beauty in the world it makes my heart burst.\u201d Six episodes later, Peter fantasizes about a blond cheerleader at a sporting event who performs a dance mirroring that of Angela. Her jacket opens, and instead of rose petals, chicken legs soar out.\n\nAn animated TV parody and a minor MTV controversy were enough to plant seeds of discontent, but the downturn\u2019s roots run deeper than anything so ephemeral. In between those two \u201cFamily Guy\u201d episodes, Sept. 11 happened. Overnight, we saw the entire world differently. The profound ideas at which \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d grasped now seemed pass\u00e9 at best and clueless at worst. Here was a saga about blue bloods, whose wealth, education and good looks had bored them to the point of crisis. The class depiction at the center seemed more like low-hanging snark than trenchant analysis. In a roundabout way, Sept. 11 was the beginning of the end for this sort of movie, much like the Vietnam War luring 1970s Hollywood away from the once-prolific Western genre.\n\nIn 2003, with the terrorist attacks\u2019 aftereffects in full swing, Jay Leno hinted at the creeping discomfort of \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d in a \u201cTonight Show\u201d monologue, joking that it\u2019s Bill Clinton\u2019s favorite movie. \u201cIsn\u2019t that odd?\u201d Leno asked. \u201cA distinguished president like Bill Clinton, his favorite film is about a guy trapped in a loveless marriage who\u2019s obsessed with having sex with a young girl.\u201d (In fact, Clinton did at least once publicly express admiration for \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d calling it \u201camazing\u201d in a 2000 interview with Ebert, when the Monica Lewinsky uproar was still fresh. He failed to see his own irony.)\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening in \"American Beauty.\"\n\nIn 2005, Premiere magazine listed \u201cBeauty\u201d as one of the 20 most overrated American movies of all time. Even in a pre-Twitter era, the list was clearly designed to be contrarian, considering \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and \u201cNashville\u201d were among its selections. Nonetheless, the tide had officially shifted. People were looking closer. Amid the 2008 recession, when the intersection of capitalism and culture rewrote Hollywood\u2019s norms for better and worse, its obsoletion intensified.\n\nIn the years since, everyone has joined the \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d backlash bandwagon. At least that\u2019s how it feels. Everyone, that is, except Katy Perry, who earnestly invoked the movie when she sang \u201cDo you ever feel like a plastic bag?\u201d on her 2010 megahit \u201cFirework.\u201d Perry hadn\u2019t gotten the message, but \u201cBroad City\u201d and \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d did. Both shows lightly mocked the overwrought bag scene during their respective debut seasons.\n\nYears after critics had professed their love, the media fully reversed course. A 2012 list published on the website Complex called it one of the 10 \u201cmost heavy-handed message movies.\u201d In 2014, IndieWire wrote, \u201cA victim, perhaps, of its own overhyping, Sam Mendes\u2019 film is by no means bad, it\u2019s just hard to remember now quite what \u2014 aside from Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening\u2019s caustically toxic performances and a terrific, often overlooked Chris Cooper \u2014 we all collectively lost our shit over.\u201d The same year, Entertainment Weekly published a piece headlined \u201cExamining \u2018American Beauty\u2019 at 15: A masterpiece, or a farce?\u201d A 2015 episode of the podcast The Canon found critics Amy Nicholson and Devin Faraci excoriating the film.\n\nAs deeper understandings of sexual abuse, income inequality and gender imbalances have come to dominate the national consciousness, \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d has been stamped out in conjunction. When actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexually harassing him at age 14, the Lester Burnham parallels were glaring. And when other Hollywood men were exposed as power-hungry deviants who preyed on young women, the image of Angela as one guy\u2019s private reverie became a token of unchecked ghoulishness. Art faded to artifice.\n\nOn top of all that discourse, time has shown just how wonderful 1999 was for movies. (Truly: The book \u201cBest. Movie. Year. Ever.: How 1999 Blew Up the Big Screen,\u201d by Brian Rafferty, came out this past April.) In a period with \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d The Sixth Sense,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d \u201cElection,\u201d \u201cMagnolia,\u201d \u201cBeing John Malkovich,\u201d \u201cEyes Wide Shut,\u201d \u201cThe Best Man,\u201d \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d and \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry,\u201d it\u2019s hard to call \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d superior. Handing Best Picture to something whose biggest cinematic impact involves snickering and divisiveness now looks like a fool\u2019s errand. \u201cElection,\u201d for instance, has more to say about suburban ennui and male folly; \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley\u201d is far more astute when it comes to wealth mobility.\n\nStill, there\u2019s something compelling about the trajectory of the \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d backlash that inadvertently makes the movie more worthwhile, too. Most significant cultural reconsiderations in the 21st century ferment online, often in relation to scandals. But this one started on television, in magazines, around water coolers, throughout the ethos. The entertainment landscape is more splintered than ever, yet we can somehow rally behind this film\u2019s changed legacy. Audiences may have known exactly what Ricky Fitts meant in 1999, but they also know exactly what he means \u2015 and what he doesn\u2019t \u2015 today.", "description": "How the Best Picture winner, which turns 20 this year, went from esteemed suburban satire to widespread punchline.", "authors": ["Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7003e83b00009605cd4e06.jpeg?cache=om4am7ulpw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
