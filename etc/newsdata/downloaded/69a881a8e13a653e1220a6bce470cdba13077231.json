A similar strategy was attempted by Theresa May, who was also met with zero success.\n\nPredictably, the EU member states gave strikingly similar responses to advances by the UK, all deferring to the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nA French government official said Emmanuel Macron had told Mr Johnson \"that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier's team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles\".\n\nMeanwhile, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay visited the Netherlands for talks with his counterpart. Stef Blok, the Dutch foreign minister, described the meeting as a \"frank and honest discussion\", adding that \"more realism and clarity [are] necessary this week\". He added that the Netherlands had \"full support for Michel Barnier\".\n\nDowning Street said Mr Johnson planned to speak to his counterparts in Sweden, Denmark and Poland over the course of day, but had no plans to announce for face-to-face meetings with EU leaders over the coming days. Asked whether Angela Merkel had turned down a request for a meeting, the PM\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThere are no confirmed travel plans. The prime minister spoke with the German chancellor shortly after our plans were published on Wednesday and they agreed to to remain in contact.\u201d\n\nPrime minister\u2019s spokesman added: \u201cHe has spoken at length with a number of his EU counterparts. We do need the EU to engage with the offer which we have made. We believe we have taken a significant step in putting forward the compromises which we have and we now need the EU to match those compromises. We are having ongoing talks but we need those talks to take place at pace and we need greater engagement with the compromises we have put forward.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The manner in which this policy is lawfully achieved is a matter for the government.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The end of the week deadline mentioned by the EU capitals is a reference to the fact that the groundwork for any deal would usually have to be completed some days before the meeting.\n\nMr Johnson has publicly said he will not seek an extension to the Brexit deadline, though court documents suggest he has privately promised to do so to comply with a law laid down by parliament. The UK is set to leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of October if no extension is secured, or the UK does not revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit.", "description": "Boris Johnson's last-ditch diplomatic offensive to convince EU capitals to back his Brexit plan has failed to garner support, ahead of a make-or-break Brussels summit next week.
