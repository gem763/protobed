Katie Hill, D-Calif., is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, April 3, 2019. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nAs Red State\u2019s Joe Cunningham wrote last week, the mainstream media are in full Protect The Democrat mode in the aftermath of the eye-opening report from Deputy Managing Editor Jennifer Van Laar on Rep. Katie Hill\u2019s (D-CA) 2 year \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with her soon-to-be ex-husband and a 22-year-old campaign staffer, and allegations that Hill also had an affair with her current legislative director Graham Kelly.\n\nJoe noted in his piece that the story was one of \u201cold fashioned use of power over subordinates in sexual relationships.\u201d And beyond the moral component, the alleged relationships bring along with them serious ethical questions.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of seeing this issue for what it is \u2013 an abuse of power \u2013 Democrats like Sen. Kamala Harris have joined the left-wing chorus of so-called \u201cfeminists\u201d, journalists, and fellow legislators in suggesting that it was Hill herself who was the victim, and that there is a double standard at play:\n\nPresidential candidate Kamala Harris has come out swinging for \u201cthrouple\u201d Rep. Katie Hill \u2014 saying her intense \u201cpublic shaming\u201d highlights a double standard for female politicians.\n\n\n\nSen. Harris told Buzzfeed News that Hill, a close political ally, was the victim of a \u201ccampaign of harassment and intimidation\u201d and \u201ccyber exploitation\u201d after naked photos of her were released to the media.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was clearly meant to embarrass her,\u201d Harris told the outlet.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much that people do about women and their sexuality that\u2019s about shaming them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt just sends a signal to other women that\u2019s discouraging them from running for office.\u201d\n\nThis is such bull sh*t that it\u2019s hard to know where to start. First, Hill\u2019s story is not one where women are held to a higher standard than men when it comes to scandals that revolve around allegations of sexual impropriety or misconduct. As Business Insider documented in 2018, \u201cnine members of the 115th US Congress have had to step down after allegations of sexual misconduct against them became public\u201d\n\n5 of them were Republicans. One of them was Rep. Joe Barton (TX). Guess why he\u2019s no longer in Congress?\n\nBarton announced in November that he wouldn\u2019t seek re-election after a nude photo and explicit messages from him were circulated online. He initially apologized for the posts and suggested he could be the victim of online exploitation, until a tea party staffer came forward with evidence of explicit messages from Barton and prompted him to announce his retirement. He served Texas\u2019 6th congressional district since 1985.\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t recall the mainstream media nor Democrats rushing to defend Barton by way of claiming he was a victim of \u201ccyber assault\u201d or any of the terms they\u2019ve used to describe Katie Hill.\n\nHarris also told Buzzfeed that Hill should be given the benefit of \u201cdue process\u201d in this situation, something that neither Hill nor Harris gave Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 2018.\n\nThe excuses being made for Hill\u2019s behavior by Harris, and other Democrats inside and outside of the mainstream media are appalling, and show where the true double standard resides. There is indeed a \u201cdouble standard\u201d, but it\u2019s not the one Harris has in mind. Instead, it\u2019s one where women are treated with kid gloves in comparison to men who are caught in similar compromising situations.\n\nIn response to the various reports from the so-called \u201cjournalists\u201d and comments from Harris and other Democrats about how Hill is the real victim here, Twitter users read them the riot act:\n\nSpare me. Katie Hill condemned Brett Kavanaugh for things he never did; the least she could do is live by her own standards, such as they are. As I like to say, the left having to live by their own rules is my favorite emotion. https://t.co/0ImsBcBE0A \u2014 Teri Christoph (@TeriChristoph) October 28, 2019\n\nTo every girl and woman: don\u2019t join the fight if you\u2019re going to demand and expect special treatment when caught violating basic ethics rules (and then blame others when you receive equal treatment). Don\u2019t be a hypocrite.

Republicans didn't make you drink until you missed flights. Republicans didn't force you into sexual relations with subordinates. These were your choices alone.
