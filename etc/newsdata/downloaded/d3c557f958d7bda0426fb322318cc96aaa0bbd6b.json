While it remains a significant banker for the fossil fuel industry, its business with the companies most aggressively expanding in the sector has fallen sharply, from $13.1bn in 2016 to $5.2bn in 2018. The first-half figure for 2019 shows the bank is on track to record another annual decrease.\n\nIn response to the figures, JPMorgan, which has faced growing protests over its fossil fuel banking activities, said it recognised the complexity of climate change and actively engaged with stakeholders on the issue.\n\nWells Fargo said it carried out enhanced checks on its energy clients, which represented a small part of its overall business.\n\nSeveral investment banks contacted by the Guardian said they were expanding quickly in renewable industries and had tightened lending policies on financing for Arctic oil and gas, coal and tar sands fossil fuel projects.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greenpeace activists put up a banner showing the Barclays logo dripping with oil at its office in London.

What can help solve the problem is, firstly, the voluntary mechanisms we are working on, like the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and then the new attention from regulators like the PRA [Prudential Regulation Authority].\n\n\u201cThe new requirements make people working in banks think about climate change as a double-sided coin, to look at the risks within our portfolio, but also thinking about the opportunity side in terms of financing renewable energy. That\u2019s leveraging the best of what a bank would offer.\u201d\n\nThe big four state-owned Chinese banks, which have no fossil fuel financing policies, have dominated services for coalminers and coal power companies since 2016.\n\nThe figures come amid growing uncertainty about the long-term viability of the oil and gas industry amid fears of a climate \u201cMinsky moment\u201d, a sudden crash in fossil-fuel-related asset prices as investors and money managers rush for the door when climate risks materialise abruptly.\n\nEnsuring a managed decline of the oil and gas industry while also financing the next wave of renewable energy products is deemed to be vital.", "description": "Exclusive: analysis reveals lenders provided $700bn to expand sector since Paris climate pact", "authors": ["Patrick Greenfield"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78683768dd9cf985391e779927cbbcc09ad5cd4/0_202_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b04859b7c196306de73dc23baf9847d9", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
