I also did my first highlights at the age of fourteen to appear blonder.\u2019\n\nMarcela pictured with her friend in a Barbie car (Picture: MDWfeatures / Marcela Iglesias)\n\nShe then grew into her body and moved to the States where she met her husband. Living in Hollywood also made it more accessible to buy items and procedures that would help her achieve her desired look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I always thought of the possibility of breast implants but for some reason after over 20 consultations I still have hesitations about them. So, I put that idea aside.\n\n\u2018Living in Hollywood helps a lot because there\u2019s a lot of stuff that I can buy to look more like a Barbie doll.\n\n\u2018Lots of people accuse me of looking fake but if you know me in person, you\u2019ll totally see that my beauty is natural. Yes, I usually create the look with makeup but that doesn\u2019t mean that I am a plastic person.\u2019\n\nHer husband Steven loves her look and has been part of her transformation.\n\nOver the course of three years, he has undergone procedures such as a platysma plasty, chin implant, Botox, fillers and PDO threads to tighten sagging skin.\n\nMarcela added: \u2018I admire what the doll represents more than how she looks. I am very respectful of the image of the Barbie doll as I want to encourage all men and women around the world to pursue their dreams and to achieve the look they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But I always say that surgery should be considered the last choice. I want to be perceived as a very strong woman that knows what she wants rather than a \u201cbimbo\u201d.\n\n\u2018Barbie is an inspiration to be whatever you want to be. You control your own destiny.\u2019\n\nMORE: There\u2019s now a Judge Barbie doll to encourage girls to explore different careers\n\nMORE: The UK\u2019s oldest human Barbie has just had her 150th cosmetic surgery\n\nMORE: Model spends \u00a345,000 on a bum lift to become the most enhanced woman in Britain\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Real estate investor Marcela Iglesias has had bum lifts and lip fillers but is scared to go under the knife to achieve her dream look.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89094078_1570621490.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
