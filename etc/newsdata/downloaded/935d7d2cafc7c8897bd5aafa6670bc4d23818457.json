It cannot remain a matter for seasonal outrage.\n\n\u201cThis indicates that, over the five-year period, birth occurrences were likely to be conceived during June or July,\u201d Stats SA said.\n\nTo further cement this, November had the lowest percentage of bambinos joining the human race, showing that much less action takes place during the sweaty, humid months at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe above are the interesting bits.\n\nBuried in the cold stats is also some rather bleak information.\n\nIn the section that spoke about how soon after birth a child is registered, we learnt that more than 95% of mothers aged between 25 and 39 tend to register their children within the first year of birth, while about 94% of those aged between 20 and 24 do the same.\n\nThen came this line: \u201cA high proportion of births registered later than the year of occurrence was observed among age groups 10 to 14 years (60.2%) and 50 to 54 years (48.6%).\u201d\n\nYes, 10 to 14 years old.\n\nThe reported figures added that the highest registrations were in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, which are the most densely populated provinces.\n\nThis applied to all ages and \u201cthe only exception was teenage mothers (aged 10 to 14), where the Eastern Cape had the highest number of births occurring among teen mothers (317), followed closely by KwaZulu-Natal with 310 births registered to teenage mothers\u201d.\n\nYes, again, 10 to 14 years old.\n\nWe reported on the Ratlou Local Municipality in North West, where information gathered from clinics reveals that 487 underage girls are either pregnant or already have children.\n\nIn a population of just 100 000, this is a big figure.\n\nMany of them are impregnated by older men who lure them with offers of money and food. As is the norm, the man vanishes as soon as the seed is planted.\n\nThe mother then has to turn to other men for economic support.\n\nAs one of the girls told City Press, \u201cmy child\u2019s father is not supportive, but things are better now because I have a new boyfriend who is a bit caring and does help sometimes\u201d.\n\nTeen pregnancy is not unique to South Africa. Millions of children are born to girls aged between 15 and 19 throughout the world every year, particularly in the developing world, where poverty makes women more vulnerable to patriarchal abuse.\n\nAnd the same pattern plays out in all these societies as girls are forced to halt their educational development to raise children.\n\nRead: When access to sexual health education and services is a matter of life or death\n\nThe guys move on to other hunts. In the 2017 demographic health survey, Stats SA reported that \u201cearly childbearing among young women is more common in nonurban areas\u201d.\n\nIt also said that the highest wealth quintile had the lowest incidence of teenage pregnancy, while the lowest had the biggest prevalence.\n\nThis again highlighted the vulnerability of poor women, particularly those in rural areas.\n\nThe same survey warned of the health risks faced by children born to very young mothers, and by the mothers themselves.\n\nThe mothers are also \u201cmore constrained in their ability to pursue educational opportunities than young women who delay childbearing\u201d.\n\nThere is also the social dysfunction that comes with children raising children.\n\nNo matter how much love they can give, they lack the maturity to mould a rounded human being as they themselves are not yet fully moulded.\n\nThis phenomenon of teenage pregnancy is not yet being treated as the crisis it is.\n\nFrom time to time, we get alarming statistics from one agency and department of state or another, and the country goes into a tailspin.\n\nThere is outrage and calls for action. The authorities promise to address the situation, whatever that means.\n\nThe moralists and the religious froth, and call for the return to old values.\n\nThen it goes quiet again \u2013 until the next set of statistics come out.\n\nCue the outrage. It is understandable why this is such a difficult issue to tackle in a sustainable way. Sexual intercourse is by its very nature private and therefore virtually impossible to police.\n\nIn cases where power relations dominate, it becomes harder to get disempowered young girls to refuse advances from boys.\n\nThen, when money, other incentives and coercion come into the picture, the battle is lost.\n\nBut we absolutely have to move this issue up on our list of priorities.\n\nIt cannot remain a matter for seasonal outrage.", "description": "This phenomenon of teenage pregnancy is not yet being treated as the crisis it is.", "authors": ["Mondli Makhanya"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5276/8ee30c50b5224933b99bc8f0be78eedb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
