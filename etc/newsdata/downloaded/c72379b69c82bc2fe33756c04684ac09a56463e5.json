We then use this information to create realistic and believable mimics. This means we can deliver suitable content extremely efficiently, tailored to a customer environment and with minimal effort on the part of the defender,\" he said.\n\nHe explained that cyber traps and decoys act as \"digital tripwires\" that allows the company to learn more about the behaviour of attackers.\n\n\"Unlike what you see on CSI, it is hard to detect intrusions and data theft. Not because traditional systems are incapable, but because criminals and people with malicious intent are always looking for new ways to hide their actions in the noise of everyday computer activity. Even when we do find something, traditional tools don't often tell us 'who' or 'why',\" he said.\n\n\"We have been exploring how to fight back against these attackers by interspersing decoy computers and data amongst real assets.\"\n\nAs part of the project, the three organisations are looking to fill two post-doctoral research fellowship positions and offering five PhD scholarships of up to AU$50,000 per annum to work on applying AI and machine learning to create these deceptive defence mechanisms.\n\nThis research partnership will create more than seven full-time research positions across the country, with options to extend the work in future years or grow the research team.\n\nPenten recently received two contracts totalling AU$2.2 million from the federal government to improve the Australian Army's cyber capabilities.\n\nUnder the deal, Penten will develop technology that seeks to enhance the Australian Army's capacity to send communications over unsecured networks.\n\nA statement from Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price at the time said funding has also been provided to help the Canberra-based startup develop a cyber-management capability and enhance security countermeasures.\n\nPenten is also among a handful of companies that have been working with AustCyber at its recently opened Canberra Cyber Security Innovation Node, which designed to grow the local cybersecurity workforce and help industry commercialise cybersecurity technologies in Australia.\n\nRelated coverage", "description": "Announced during D61+ Live, the joint research project will use Data61's AI research to create \"cyber traps\" and \"decoys\".", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/11/02/84fd5e79-6069-42b6-bbfb-406f46c09844/thumbnail/770x578/9762ef3970f3c0d0d6a9ae6d75b9e880/agile-it-nov-2015-traps.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
