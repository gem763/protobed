Photo: Photo: Courtesy of the retailer.\n\nBuying the right car seat for your child is maybe one of the most important decisions you can make as a new parent. How tight is tight enough? Front-facing or rear-facing? And how do you install the thing? To find the best car seats, we spoke to car seat safety-installation experts, including Lorrie Walker, the safety and training adviser at Safe Kids Worldwide; pediatrician Ben Hoffman, who helps write official American Academy of Pediatrics policies on child-passenger safety; Jennifer Saxton, founder of car seat cleaning-and-installation service Tot Squad (who is also a child-passenger safety technician); Jennifer LaBracio, gear editor at Babylist; and Jonathan Gondek, an expert from New York\u2013based crash-testing site Calspan. We also asked a dozen parents across the country.\n\nEach expert pointed out that every car seat on the market has passed the same rigorous safety-testing standards, so they\u2019re all \u2014 at minimum \u2014 equipped to protect your child during a crash. Finding your own best seat depends on the model of your car, your child\u2019s age and weight (for more info, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration provides a guide), and which features make the car seats easier to install correctly (and thus safer). \u201cThe best car seat for any child and family is the car seat that fits the child, fits the car, and that the family will be able to use correctly every time,\u201d says Hoffman. \u201cFrom a safety perspective, we recommend that kids stay in the safest car seat until they outgrow it,\u201d says Saxton. \u201cDon\u2019t try to move your kid too quickly to the next car seat, because you\u2019re actually decreasing in safety each step you go through that four car seat process,\u201d In other words, children should max out the weight limit of their current car seat before moving up to the next stage. Though there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all option, we asked experts for car-seat recommendations that would fit a variety of vehicles, plus make installation smoother and safer.\n\nBest infant car seats\n\nNuna Pipa Lite LX Infant Car Seat Saxton recommends the Nuna Pipa Lite because it\u2019s lightweight, simple to use, and safe. (The Pipa Lite is the lighter version of the Pipa, which, at eight pounds instead of 5.7, is another solid choice and costs about $100 less.) \u201cSimple in that it\u2019s easy to install because of a rigid latch system that holds the seat in, and safe because of the added load leg,\u201d a safety feature exclusive to infant seats that connects down into the floorboards (and a feature also recommended by Hoffman and Gondek). \u201cWhen you use the stability leg, you\u2019re dispersing the crash through the steel frame of the vehicle, and that reduces the forward motion from the crash by 40 percent,\u201d says Saxton. LaBracio agrees that the Pipa Lite is a great option for a lightweight infant car seat. As both of them note, however, it can only be used with its base. The car seat alone cannot be strapped into a car, which means you\u2019d need to bring the entire system with you when you travel. $400 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nUppababy Mesa Infant Car Seat Another infant car seat that came recommended by parents \u2014 such as Mei Ling Starkey of the blog Family Entourage \u2014 and LaBracio is the Uppababy Mesa. This one has a no-rethread harness, which is a feature that Walker recommended for ease of installation as your child grows up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to rethread your harness when your child gets bigger. You pull the tabs to tighten it, and the harness slides right down until it\u2019s right over the child\u2019s shoulder. You can put a tall child in it one day and get a perfect fit, or a tiny, tiny child in it the next day.\u201d Parents also love that it simply clicks into Uppababy\u2019s Vista and Cruz strollers, as well as into the Minu with adapters. As a side note, our experts recommend buying car seats that match with the stroller you\u2019re going to use to form a click-and-go travel system that doesn\u2019t require purchasing separate adapters. But if you want to mix and match stroller and car seat brands, here\u2019s a handy compatibility chart from Babylist that lists all the most popular car seats and strollers and the required adapters to create the travel system of your choice. $300 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nChicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat For something slightly more affordable, the Chicco KeyFit has excellent reviews, and was also a favorite among the parents we surveyed for its ease of installation. Allyson Downey, who runs a consumer review site for child and baby essentials called WeeSpring, says that for her first child, she bought the Chicco KeyFit after doing extensive research. \u201cIt had outstanding reviews,\u201d she says. Lauren Brown, Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital\u2019s lead car seat safety specialist, says the seat is a popular choice among parents she works with, too, because the brand has a YouTube video that demonstrates exactly how to install it. LaBracio and Saxton like it, too. Saxton calls it a \u201ctried and true, solid car seat choice.\u201d $200 at Amazon Buy $200 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBritax B-Safe Ultra Cool Flow Infant Car Saxton also recommends the Britax B-Safe infant car seat, which has added side impact protection, a steel frame, and a safe center LATCH installation system that uses center-pull straps to securely and easily fasten the seat base into the vehicle seat. This particular model comes with an airy mesh fabric Saxton likes. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a hot climate you can keep your baby from sweating,\u201d she says. \u201cI often see sweat stains [in car seats that I\u2019m cleaning]. Their poor babies are roasting, so those airflow seats from Britax are really cool.\u201d $250 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nClek Liing Infant Car Seat Clek is a premium brand out of Canada, and they recently released their first infant car seat, which, according to Saxton, Clek fans have been waiting on for years. \u201cThe Liing is absolutely beautiful,\u201d she says, adding that the brand brings European safety standards to the United States, making it an appealing choice for parents who are really safety conscious. (Generally speaking, European safety standards are higher than in the U.S.) Saxton likes that it\u2019s got a rigid LATCH system, which makes it easier to install for a lot of people. $400 at Buy Buy Baby Buy $400 at Clek Buy\n\nBest convertible car seats\n\nDiono Radian 3 RXT Convertible car seats, the next step up from an infant car seat, convert from rear-facing to forward-facing modes, and the switch is typically made when your child maxes out of the weight limit of the rear-facing mode. Saxton\u2019s favorite seat in this category is the Diono Radian, whose upper weight limit in rear-facing mode is 45 pounds. She loves its steel frame: This means it has a longer expiration date of ten years, compared to an average of four or five years for a plastic-molded seat. \u201cThe reason people love this car seat is that it\u2019s just like a tank. You feel really secure that your child is riding safely,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do not recommend it as a travel car seat because it\u2019s very heavy,\u201d she adds. It\u2019s also narrow-bodied \u2014 one of the narrowest car seats on the market, according to Saxton \u2014 so it will leave you with enough room to fit three in the backseat, making it ideal for a growing family or for carpooling. \u201cThat\u2019s Diono\u2019s biggest selling point,\u201d agrees LaBracio. Because the AAP now recommends that kids be kept rear-facing as long as possible (research suggests that rear-facing kids are at a lower risk for injury in a crash), Saxton also notes that this car seat has a higher weight limit for its rear-facing mode at 45 pounds. When using it as a booster, the weight limit goes all the way up to 120 pounds. $300 at Amazon Buy $300 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBritax Marathon ClickTight Convertible Car Seat We also suggest the Britax Marathon, which has a ClickTight system that makes it very easy to install in the car. Britax in general was a popular choice among the parents surveyed for this reason. Kenny Fried, the vice-president of Brotman | Winter | Fried tells me, \u201cI swap my car seats from car to minivan, and the extreme simplicity of the ClickTight system is THE feature. Instead of having to thread the seat belt behind the seat and have a pro install it, you lift the inside seat up (like on a hinge) and then pull the seat belt over and click in the seat belt. Takes about 30 seconds to install.\u201d This one also has the no-rethread harness Walker suggested, to fit your child as they grow. LaBracio agrees that the no-rethread harness is a plus. If you wanted even more protection in a crash, you could also invest in an attachable anti-rebound bar from Britax that works with its convertible car seats in rear-facing mode: It\u2019s another feature Hoffman recommended for decreasing rebound movement in crashes. $280 at Amazon Buy From $280 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nNuna Rava Convertible Car Seat \u201cNuna is really big in the car seat market all of a sudden,\u201d says LaBracio.\u201d Saxton agrees, saying that Nuna fans are \u201cdie hard.\u201d They both note that Nuna\u2019s convertible car seat, the Rava, is definitely premium, with a price tag of $450 to match, and that it\u2019s only sold through specialty stores like Nordstrom. \u201cNuna is just beautiful,\u201d Saxton says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things about it that are really easy to use, and from a safety perspective, they\u2019re bringing in a lot of those European safety standards.\u201d LaBracio adds that people love that it has a high rear-facing weight limit of 50 pounds. It also has an extended leg rest, slim profile, a 10-position recline, an easy installation system, and is outfitted in flame-retardant-free fabric, among other features. \u201cIt\u2019s a really high quality, lovely seat,\u201d LaBracio says. $500 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest combination and all-in-one car seats\n\nBritax Grow With You ClickTight Plus A combination car seat is forward-facing only car seat that goes from forward-facing mode with a built-in five-point harness to a booster seat that uses the car\u2019s seat belt when the child outgrows the harness weight or height limit. Saxton\u2019s favorite in this category is the Britax Grow With You car seat (an update of the Pinnacle) because of the ClickTight system. She adds that this seat also has added side impact and safe-cell impact protection, which are honeycomb compression towers in the base of the car seat that lower the center of gravity and reduce forward motion in a crash. It can support kids up to 120 pounds in booster mode, and has a steel frame. $300 at Amazon Buy $300 at Amazon Buy\n\nAll-in-one car seats \u2014 seats that convert from infant rear-facing to forward-facing to booster mode, allowing a child to use it from birth to 4 years old and older and up to 120 pounds in weight \u2014 are gaining in popularity due to their one-and-done quality. (Instead of buying two or three separate car seats (infant, convertible, and booster) over the course of your child\u2019s first years, the thinking with an all-in-one is that you can buy just one and save money in the process.) However, it should be noted that one of the experts we spoke to wasn\u2019t so keen on them, hypothesizing that the misuse rate of all-in-one car seats is higher than on other car seats, since there are so many features and parts that they\u2019re harder to get right. And if you\u2019re going to use one car seat over the course of 10 years or so, you should expect to do some work to keep it clean.\n\nNuna Exec All-In-One Car Seat Even with those caveats, there are a couple of new models out there that are worth mentioning, like the Nuna Exec, which both Saxton and LaBracio say will most likely be a popular choice among Nuna fans. \u201cOne of my colleagues is testing it out right now, and she loves it so far,\u201d says LaBracio. \u201cShe said that it was really easy to install, that the material is beautiful and wipes clean really easily, and that the padding is really soft.\u201d It can be used from birth (starting at five pounds in rear-facing mode) to up to 120 pounds as a booster. $650 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nGraco 4Ever Extend2Fit Platinum 4-in-1 Car Seat For something a little more affordable, Saxton and LaBracio both mention that Graco\u2019s 4Ever all-in-one car seat is gaining in popularity among parents. It\u2019s suitable for use for babies starting at 4 pounds (with a 50-pound rear-facing limit) up to 120 pounds in the booster mode. It also has a six-position recline, a feature that LaBracio especially likes. $360 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest booster car seat\n\nClek Oobr Booster Car Seat Booster seats are the last stage in car seats, which is typically going to start around the ages of 7 to 10 years old, though the weight limit for them is around 110 pounds. Some booster seats will be high-back-only, backless boosters, or can convert between the two modes: this Clek Oobr one that Saxton recommends is the latter. \u201cWhat I always recommend is a booster with lower anchors, so it attaches to the car,\u201d says Saxton. This model has a rigid latch system, so it\u2019s easy to use, has energy-absorbing foam, and she also calls out the fact that it reclines, so your kid can take a nap. \u201cIt\u2019s got some of the best crash-test results and has a high weight limit, too.\u201d LaBracio also likes the Oobr, saying that Klek in general makes very durable, well thought-out products, but notes that it is an expensive brand. From $300 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest car seats for traveling\n\nWhile the best and safest car seats are typically sturdier, they\u2019re usually not lightweight, which is why many parents end up buying a separate one for traveling in cars and planes. Saxton adds that for car travel, rental car seats are a no-go because you never know their history (if they\u2019re expired, dirty, or damaged). Here, our experts recommend some popular lightweight, portable car seats, most that comply with Federal Aviation Administration standards (and if not, we\u2019ve indicated so). Saxton and LaBracio also add that it\u2019s always safer for your child to travel on an airplane in a car seat than sitting on your lap (something that the American Association of Pediatrics, Federal Aviation Administration, and National Transportation Safety Board all recommend travelers do) \u2014 even if that means buying an extra seat (babies under 2 years old are not legally required to use a car seat in an airplane and usually ride for free.) \u201cThey strap down peanuts in a plane, why not your baby?\u201d LaBracio says.\n\nGraco SnugRide SnugLock 35 DLX Infant Car Seat When it comes to car seats for Ubers and planes, Renee McCabe \u2014 the Injury Prevention and Safe Kids coordinator for Safe Kids Greater Augusta, with over 20 years of installation experience \u2014 says she looks for lightweight ones with narrow bases (so they can fit on airplane seats, which vary by airline. See Seat Guru for exact widths), and have a clip-in stroller. It\u2019s why she likes this Graco Snugride, which weighs seven pounds, has a narrow base, and a stroller attachment. Rear-facing, it can support babies up to 35 pounds, and it consistently gets good reviews online. $200 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nDoona Infant Car Seat and Stroller Another lightweight infant car seat you might want to consider for an all-in-one traveling unit is the Doona infant car seat and stroller (it\u2019s basically a car seat and stroller in one) Charlie Stein, brand relations manager at Biederman Redevelopment Ventures, says he used the Doona for his firstborn and that it made being a first-time parent much easier. \u201cI have had multiple people ask me what it is, particularly because the Doona fits perfectly in airplane seats, and I say \u2018Transformers for adults.\u2019\u201d He adds that for car travel, it\u2019s very easy to install, and clicks to let you know that the car seat is locked in. It does run slightly expensive at $500 for the seat and stroller, but for the streamlined traveling experience, it could be well worth the investment. Saxton, who used it as her everyday car seat (and stroller) when her baby was an infant, agrees, saying that its convenience cannot be beat. She notes, however, that the only (minor) downside of traveling with the Doona is that it\u2019s just a tad too wide to roll down the aisle of an airplane, which means you have to carry it to your seat instead. $500 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy $499 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nCosco Scenera Next Convertible Car Seat In the convertible category, both McCabe and Saxton suggested the eight-pound Cosco Scenera, which is easily accessible in most retail stores. \u201cIt\u2019s a $40 car seat that you can find at Walmart,\u201d Saxton says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to install in planes, can be installed upright so babies can have neck control, and comes in a one-piece shell, so there are no extra parts you have to deal with.\u201d LaBracio also recommends this car seat for travel, saying that \u201cpeople love it. Everyone in the city has one when their kid ages out of the bucket seat. Easy to install, no-frills, super affordable, and you can carry it.\u201d It can be used in the rear-facing position for infants starting at four pounds and up to 40 pounds in the forward-facing position. $40 at Walmart Buy\n\nSafety 1st Guide 65 Convertible Car Seat McCabe says this Safety 1st convertible car seat is another popular choice for traveling. It weighs 14 pounds, and has a higher weight limit in rear-facing mode, meaning you can keep your child rear-facing for longer. $98 at Amazon Buy $98 at Amazon Buy\n\nWAYB Pico Car Seat For a combination travel seat, Saxton recommends the Pico from new car seat company WAYB. It just launched within the last few months, but Saxton says that it\u2019s already generating a lot of buzz among bloggers. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s one that everybody wants,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s just a little bit pricey.\u201d It\u2019s a lightweight booster seat that\u2019s actually a combination seat, so you can use it with a five-point harness or with the seat belt. It weighs just 8 pounds (Saxton says there\u2019s a picture of her lifting it with one finger) with a compact aerospace-grade aluminum frame and can be easily folded, stowed, and carried, making it ideal for ride shares and airplane travel. It\u2019s suitable for children 2 years and older and weighing between 22 and 50 pounds. It\u2019s available for pre-order. $320 at WAYB Buy\n\nHifold The Fit-and-Fold Booster For a high-back booster seat that\u2019s great for travel, Saxton raves about the Hifold, which she calls \u201cone of the most innovative things that\u2019s hit the market this year in terms of car seats.\u201d \u201cThe Hifold is awesome. It\u2019s made to global safety standards, and those things fold up so portably, if you want to just stuff it in a backpack, for instance,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you still get the security of a high-back booster seat. It\u2019s super cool.\u201d It\u2019s three times smaller than a regular booster seat and is adjustable in the seat width, the body width, the head width, and height, which, according to the website, \u201censures optimal seat belt fit and comfort, no matter the size or shape of the child.\u201d That means it can grow with your child, from 33 to 100 pounds. The Hifold was created by the makers of Mifold Grab and Go Booster Car Seat, a tiny, folding booster \u2014 \u201cmaybe the size of my two hands next to each other, and that width as well,\u201d according to Saxton, \u2014 that instead of lifting up your kid, creates a path for the seat belt that hits your child at the right spot, instead: low on the hips and across the shoulders. Saxton recommends starting with the Hiback then transitioning into the Mifold as your child gets bigger. $159 at Mifold Buy\n\nEvenflo Amp High Back Car Seat Booster Here\u2019s a cheaper alternative for a high-back booster seat that McCabe recommends. It runs about $40 and is only about eight pounds, so it\u2019s very lightweight for travel. This one transitions to a no-back booster seat and has six height settings to adjust to your child, plus a built-in cup holder. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nBubblebum Backless Inflatable Travel Booster $27 (was $30, now 10% off) For something that\u2019s so lightweight, you could keep it in your pocket, Saxton, McCabe, and LaBracio pointed us in the direction of this inflatable Bubblebum travel booster seat, which has a huge following among parents. \u201cThis is an inflatable car seat that\u2019s the size of a balloon. A lot of families love these for carpool because it can fit in a backpack,\u201d says Saxton. Boosters are not approved to use in an airplane, but McCabe notes that it\u2019s ideal for hopping in cars or Ubers. $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
