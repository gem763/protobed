The goal was reportedly to alter the company\u2019s senior management to include Americans, so that business dealings in the Ukraine would become friendlier towards Western countries.\n\nThe allies work was disrupted when former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko lost a reelection bid to Volodymyr Zelensky, who is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Trump. After Zelensky's election, Trump coaxed him to investigate political opponent Joe Biden and his son in a phone call that sparked a whistleblower complaint.\n\nAfter Poroshenko's defeat, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry reportedly picked up the torch on Naftogaz.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the Secretary\u2019s dealings with the company, Perry, the former Texas governor, reportedly had a slate of candidates in mind to join Naftogaz\u2019s board. Perry reportedly floated fellow Texans Robert Bensh, a Houston oil executive currently with Pelicourt LLC, and Michael Bleyzer, head of a private equity firm based in Houston.\n\nPresident Trump has tried to place blame for the July phone call between himself and his Ukrainian counterpart on Perry, claiming that the Secretary asked him to make the call to inquire about a liquified natural gas plant.\n\nAs an immensely powerful state gas company, the makeup of Naftogaz\u2019s supervisory board, a three-person entity, is fraught with political and economic implications the world over. Therefore, selection of board members goes through many bodies before being chosen. The Ukrainian president\u2019s Cabinet consults with international institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the United States and the European Union, before the board is approved by the Ukrainian Cabinet.\n\nThe Trump allies, a circle of businessmen and Republican donors, reportedly used their connections to Trump and Giuliani to try to get sway over a favorable board makeup. At stake for Naftogaz was lucrative contracts to Western companies controlled by the allies. According to sources with knowledge of their tactics, the group was armed with inside knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s diplomatic plans.\n\nAllies reportedly told people of the White House\u2019s plan to recall the United State\u2019s Ukrainian ambassador months before she was pulled out. One source was so alarmed by the exchange of information that he reported it to a U.S. Embassy official in Ukraine months ago, AP reports.\n\nA U.S. Energy Department spokesperson has denied that Perry worked to advance anyone\u2019s personal profit interests as Energy Secretary.", "description": "Rick Perry and allies of Rudy Giuliani reportedly aimed to install new senior management at Naftogaz, according to AP sources.", "authors": ["Audrey Mcnamara"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570405664/GettyImages-803528434_rx3wyi", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
