Maritza Elizabeth posted what, at first glimpse, looks like a normal photo of a baby monitor image. In the shot, her little one is asleep in his crib. But if you look closer, you'll see that he appears to be sleeping with a ghostly baby, lying on its back with its mouth agape. Creepy doesn't begin to cover it.\n\nMaritza wrote, \"So, last night I was positive there was a ghost baby in the bed with my son. I was so freaked out, I barely slept. I even tried creeping in there with a flashlight while my son was sleeping.\"\n\nIn the morning, the unnerved mom went to \"investigate a bit further.\" She discovered the perfectly logical explanation for the \"baby ghost\": \"It turns out my husband just forgot to put the mattress protector on when he changed the sheets. I could kill him.\" In other words, the baby ghost was actually just a photo of a cute L.O. that appears on the mattress label.\n\nThe post has wracked up over 300K shares and 72K comments since the now-amused mom shared it.\n\nIt's heartening to know that the freaky, Halloween-spirited story ended with lots of laughter. And no doubt it also served as a reminder to use a mattress protector, which is clearly more multipurpose than many parents realized.", "description": "A mom says that after seeing what she couldn't help but think was a ghost in bed with her L.O., she was \"so freaked out\" she \"barely slept.\" Turns out there was a perfectly logical explanation for the specter.", "authors": ["Maressa Brown"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
