But while legions of eager sightseers and well-heeled globetrotters descend upon Denmark\u2019s colorful capital city every year, few manage to make it beyond Copenhagen\u2019s border. Despite the fact that it\u2019s a relatively small country (especially when compared to its Nordic neighbors like Sweden, Finland, and Norway), there are still plenty of regions worth exploring just outside the city limits.\n\nNorth Sealand is a prime example, encompassing the northernmost portion of the Danish island of Zealand (which is also home to Copenhagen). Boasting a slew of nicknames, the region is also known as Nordsj\u00e6lland, the King\u2019s Coast, and the Danish Riviera. But with its quaint villages, coveted beaches, and coastal vibe, this laid-back-but-luxe retreat feels more like Denmark\u2019s very own version of Cape Cod.\n\nFor generations, in-the-know Danes have flocked to North Sealand\u2019s pristine shores for a quintessential summer escape (including a long list of royals and other members of Denmark\u2019s upper echelon). These days, the dreamy destination is expanding its appeal and attracting visitors all year long, not just during the sweltering high season. Considering its unique combination of historic castles, stunning properties, and stellar gastronomic gems, it isn\u2019t hard to understand why. So the next time you find yourself exploring ever-enchanting Copenhagen, be sure to extend your visit with a jaunt up north to experience this idyllic slice of Denmark.\n\nSTAY\n\nAnyone who has ever ventured to Copenhagen may already be familiar with the award-winning Hotel Sanders, a five-star boutique property owned by renowned Danish ballet dancer Alexander K\u00f8lpin. Its sister property, Helenekilde Badehotel, is the star of North Sealand, located in charming seaside town of Tisvildeleje. Built in 1896 as a private summer home by a construction magnate, it was acquired by K\u00f8lpin in 2001 and underwent a complete renovation in 2008 to update the landmark property while preserving its familial spirit. Today, the winsome retreat is known for its sun-drenched guestrooms, sweeping overlooks of the Kattegat, and dynamic restaurant serving modern Nordic cuisine.\n\nHotel Hornb\u00e6khus is another beloved seaside sanctuary just minutes away from the windswept shores of Hornb\u00e6k Beach. Originally constructed in 1904, the recently renovated property boasts 36 whimsical rooms that perfectly marry hygge ideals with retro design details. For direct beach access, book a stay at the hotel\u2019s sister property, Villa Strand, which offers 15 rooms and debuted earlier this year.\n\nThe restaurant Tisvilde Kro is a North Sealand gem. Ian Centrone\n\nDINE\n\nRestaurant Sletten has developed a sparkling reputation that continues to seduce both tourists and locals alike, thanks to its Michelin-star prestige and privileged waterfront view. Located in the idyllic town of Sletten, the restaurant is nestled among former fishermen\u2019s cottages and serves an inventive a la carte menu of small plates that showcase seasonal local ingredients.\n\nFor farm-fresh cuisine, reserve a table at Rabarbergaarden. The limited menu constantly changes based on whatever produce is being harvested from the restaurant\u2019s organic farm at any given time. Meat and fish dishes are also available throughout the seasons, with all ingredients being sourced from the region. Be sure to explore their extensive wine list, or try a cocktail made with buzzworthy Botanisk Gin (made using a selection of Danish berries and botanicals).\n\nFrom its bespoke design details to its impeccable menu, Tisvilde Kro is another North Sealand gem that is not to be missed. Danish entrepreneur and multimillionaire Thorvald Stigsen (known for founding travel brands Skygate and Momondo) had the idea to buy a dilapidated building in Tisvilde and save it from demolition by transforming it into a swanky restaurant. After two years of painstaking renovations, the final result proves it was well worth the wait. Just look for the pink building standing on top of the hill.\n\nFredricksborg Castle. Ian Centrone\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nArt aficionados won\u2019t want to miss the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art , located in Humlebaek, just 25 miles north of Copenhagen. As Denmark\u2019s most visited museum, the attraction boasts one of the world\u2019s most impressive collections of modern art. Past and present exhibitions include works by visionaries such as Jackson Pollock, Arne Jacobsen, Henri Matisse, Pipilotti Rist, and more. Known for its \u201chot and cold\u201d approach (mixing accomplished artists with up-and-coming talents), the museum has been mesmerizing guests since it first opened its doors back in 1958.\n\nFor literature-lovers and history buffs alike, be sure to spend some time exploring the port city of Elsinore (also known as Helsing\u00f8r). Here, visitors can tour the 15th-century Kronborg Castle, which served as inspiration for the setting of William Shakespeare \u2019s Hamlet. A designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, the spectacular palace overlooks the \u00d8resund strait with majesty, marked by its ornate columns, towers, and spires. To see more of North Sealand\u2019s impressive collection of castles (hence its \u201cKing\u2019s Coast\u201d moniker), pay a visit to Fredriksborg Castle in Hiller\u00f8d or the Baroque-style Fredensborg Palace and its regal gardens.\n\nElsinore also houses the M/S Maritime Museum (adjacent to the castle). The collection was established in 1915, but its current subterranean location was conceived in 2013 by the renowned architects of the Bjarke Ingels Group. Built around a dry dock and designed to resemble a ship, the 82,000-square-foot museum contains thousands of artistic works and artifacts related to Denmark\u2019s seafaring past.\n\nThis writer was a guest of Visit Denmark .", "description": "The country\u2019s version of Cape Cod features plentiful historical, cultural, and gastronomic options", "authors": ["Ian Centrone"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111779/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
