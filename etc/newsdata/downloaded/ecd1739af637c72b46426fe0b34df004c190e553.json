Sanchez kept walking, arms still raised.\n\nThree seconds and two commands later, the officer opened fire. Body-camera footage now released by police in San Bernardino, Calif., captures the five shots that killed Sanchez and a woman\u2019s screams as he fell onto the lawn.\n\nThe officer\u2019s decisions \u201cdid not meet the standards held by our department or the community we serve,\u201d acting police chief Eric McBride said in a Friday briefing, a year after the Sept. 28 shooting. The employee is no longer on the force, he said, and the San Bernardino district attorney is investigating for potential criminal charges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe alarming video was released as fatal shootings by police continue to stoke outrage around the country and leave communities skeptical that they will receive justice.\n\nThe recent conviction of a former Dallas officer who shot her neighbor in his home, as well as murder charges against a Fort Worth officer who killed a woman playing video games in her house, were hailed by some as encouraging signs of law enforcement being held accountable for unjustified deadly force. But years of cases that did not lead to firings or charges have sown distrust.\n\nSanchez\u2019s family praised San Bernardino police\u2019s willingness to scrutinize Sanchez\u2019s killing in a statement provided to local media.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile Richard\u2019s sudden passing has left a void that cannot be filled in the lives of his family members, the family is honored and encouraged by the swift acceptance of responsibility by the leadership of the San Bernardino Police Department \u2014 whose investigation into this tragic incident was aimed at uncovering the truth, even when this meant acknowledging the mistakes of a fellow officer,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAD\n\nThe family\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPolice say they responded to the home in San Bernardino after Sanchez\u2019s sister-in-law called to say he was threatening family members in the kitchen with a handgun and making odd statements \u2014 for example, that he was \u201cGod.\u201d The woman feared for her safety and escaped the house with children, according to officials. Officers found Sanchez inside the house with his weapon in hand, body-camera footage shows.\n\nAD\n\nWeapons trained on Sanchez through the open front door, police told the man to drop his gun several times. He set it on a couch.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, and without being told to do so, Sanchez advanced toward the officers, taking eight steps,\u201d Sgt. John Echevarria said in a briefing on the video.\n\nCommanded to put his hands up, Sanchez complied. But he kept walking through three orders to stop, Echevarria said.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the officer who fired on Sanchez, whose name was not immediately available, was dismissed or if he resigned, though McBride said that \u201cdisciplinary action has been initiated.\u201d The San Bernardino Police Department did not immediately respond to questions from The Post.\n\nAD\n\nThe other officer in the body-cam footage has returned to duty, police said.\n\nMcBride noted that members of his department \u201crespond to fast-moving and often dangerous situations every day,\u201d adding later that \u201ceach encounter is unique and requires officers to make split-second decisions without the benefit of 20-20 hindsight.\u201d\n\nThe chief did not detail how the officer\u2019s decision-making failed to meet standards and said the police department\u2019s internal review of the officer\u2019s actions did not make a finding on whether he violated the law.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The acting police chief in San Bernardino, Calif., said the officer\u2019s decisions \u201cdid not meet the standards held by our department.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c-UDIHrY4mqhC6kQADMAtPmcBHA=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-26-2019/t_5aa65673ae344c7293d671e5d0ce3bc9_name_gun_thumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
