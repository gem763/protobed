Is there a slim chance?... Because I\u2019m being quite mindful of the fact that she\u2019s up the duff, she\u2019s pregnant, she\u2019s got a baby in there and we need to be mindful...\n\n'All of the stress this might be causing but you know, we cannot stop reading about it \u2013 I\u2019m human!'\n\nIt has been revealed that Rebekah has hired a team of forensic IT experts to prove her innocence after Coleen accused her of selling stories to the press through information she obtained from her private Instagram.\n\nSources close to Rebekah say she is preparing to hit back and is working with her lawyers to prove she had nothing to do with the leak.\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these claims on social media after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and hinted that it was Rebekah\n\nAn insider exclusively told MailOnline: 'Rebekah has been incredibly stressed and hasn\u2019t stopped sobbing all day, which is very out of character for her.\n\n'The whole situation has left her distraught and she still doesn\u2019t understand why Coleen didn\u2019t reach out to her first to ask her outright about the issue.\n\n'She\u2019s flying home early from Dubai as she feels her time abroad has been spoilt and all she wants is to be surrounded by family.\n\n'Rebekah wants to prove she had nothing to do with the leaked stories and is working with a lawyer and IT experts who can look at the forensics of her Instagram, which several people have access to.'\n\nBetrayal: Coleen and Rebekah pictured together at the England vs Wales game in France\n\nA spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'\n\nFans have also praised Rooney \u2013 calling her \u2018Wagatha Christie\u2019 - for the sensational way in which she revealed Vardy was the alleged culprit by concluding her post with a thriller-worthy 'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nThe saga began when Coleen took to social media to reveal she had suspected someone close to her had been betraying her for years and she had conclusive proof that her friend Rebekah was the guilty party.\n\nColeen admitted that stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection were only viewed by Rebekah and these were subsequently followed by media outlets, including MailOnline.\n\nThe Sun has since removed their story about Coleen's basement flooding after discovering she had made it up.\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation - she also slammed her for going public when she is heavily pregnant\n\nColeen wrote: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n'After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while). Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into The Sun newspaper.\n\nWar of the WAGs: Coleen was pictured laughing with her phone in hand before the news broke on Wednesday\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nTune in to Heart Breakfast with Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden, weekdays from 06:30am \u2013 10am", "description": "Additionally, Amanda seemed keen to point out that Rebekah is heavily pregnant, in what was another echo of her denial statement.", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19538416-0-image-a-34_1570710487761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
