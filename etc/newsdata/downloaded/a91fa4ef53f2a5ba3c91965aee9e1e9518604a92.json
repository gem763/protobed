Non-GAAP earnings are expected between 1 cent and 2 cents.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stayed flat at 1 cent over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $129.69 million.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\n\n\nFactors to Watch\n\n\n\nZoom\u2019s expanding customer base is a key catalyst. At the end of first-quarter fiscal 2020, the company had roughly 58,500 customers (with more than 10 employees), up 86% year over year.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) authorization received by Zoom in May is a significant development. The authorization will allow the U.S. Federal Government agencies and contractors to securely use Zoom for video meetings, API integrations and more.\n\n\n\nIn June, the company announced enhanced features for its video-first unified communications platform, Zoom Rooms. The company partnered with the likes of Logitech (NASDAQ: ) and Lenovo (OTC: ) to boost the capabilities of the platform.\n\n\n\nNotably, Zoom has a strong partner base that includes the likes of salesforce.com and Slack.\n\n\n\nThe company also announced the availability of Zoom Phone cloud phone service in Australia and the U.K. in July.\n\n\n\nThe aforesaid factors are expected to have helped Zoom expand user base in the to-be-reported quarter. However, increased expenses related to new sales representative hires are expected to hurt profitability.\n\n\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\n\n\nAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.\n\n\n\nZoom has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.
