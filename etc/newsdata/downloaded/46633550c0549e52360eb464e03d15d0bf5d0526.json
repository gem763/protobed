Plus BoC Outlook", "language": "en", "text": "Kathy Lien, Managing Director Of FX Strategy For BK Asset Management\n\nDaily FX Market Roundup October 29, 2019\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates for the third time this year and the is trading strongly ahead of the . hovers right underneath 109, its strongest level in nearly 2 months, which is unusual because the prospect of easing should be negative not positive for the currency. However with showing a 94% chance of a cut, the performance of the dollar confirms that investors expect this to be the central bank\u2019s last move of the year. If they are right, the dollar could extend its gains after the rate decision. Throughout this year, we\u2019ve seen currencies rally after easing on numerous occasions including the September FOMC and ECB because of guidance, which sets expectations for forward-looking policy actions.\n\nIn the case of the Fed, an October cut would mark the third consecutive move by the central bank. The last time we had a series of back-to-back moves this long was in 2008. We know from the last policy meeting that the Fed is divided and there\u2019s a subset of policymakers who do not believe further easing is necessary. Two FOMC members voted against a cut in September and that number goes up to five when non-voting members are included. Five who agreed with the cut that month did not see further moves this year.\n\nThe economy weakened since the last meeting with falling, slowing, easing and moderating. But there was also good news \u2013 the rate of in the U.S. hit a 50-year low, improved and stocks hit record highs. So while the central bank could justify another rate cut, it probably won\u2019t be unanimous and Fed Chair Powell could downplay the need for additional moves. If that\u2019s the case, will surge above 109 and could even hit 109.50 after the Fed lowers rates. We also expect a decent pullback in as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is the last major central bank that could realistically lower this year.\n\nHowever could see profit taking ahead of the rate decision. are scheduled for release and between the drop in and widening of the , growth is expected to slow in the third quarter. Considering that the market is looking for the Fed to ease, no one will be surprised by softer numbers.\n\nUSD Data Points\n\nThe will also be in focus on Wednesday with a Bank of Canada on the calendar. Although the moves in the will be limited ahead of FOMC, if the Bank of Canada maintains their optimistic/neutral outlook, we could see new lows in the currency. When they last met, the BoC left rates unchanged and talked about the ongoing strength in the , pickup in wages and overall strength in the economy. This time, they have to consider the impact of weaker , lower , softer and moderation in housing. The is still strong with Canada adding more than 50K jobs in September. Wage growth should be firmer as well but weakness in the rest of the economy along with the slowdown in the U.S. could lead to more cautious comments from the BoC. If that happens, Tuesday\u2019s recovery in USD/CAD will turn into a sustainable bottom in the currency, especially if the U.S. dollar rallies.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: USD/JPY, USD/CAD, NZD/USD, US Dollar Index Futures.
