The governor wants an investigation", "language": "en", "text": "Adam Beam\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 California\u2019s governor has asked the attorney general to investigate why the state\u2019s gas prices are so high, pointing to a new report suggesting big oil companies are \u201cmisleading and overcharging customers\u201d by as much as $1 per gallon.\n\nName brand retailers \u2013 including 76, Chevron and Shell \u2013 often charge more because they say their gasoline is of higher quality. But a new analysis from the California Energy Commission could not explain the price difference, concluding \u201cthere is no apparent difference in the quality of gasoline at retail outlets in the state.\u201d\n\nThe commission said California drivers paid an average of 30 cents more per gallon in 2018, with the difference getting as high as $1 per gallon in April of this year. The result is California drivers paid an additional $11.6 billion at the pump over the last five years.\n\n\u201cThere is no identifiable evidence to justify these premium prices,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter to Attorney General Xavier Becerra. \u201cIf oil companies are engaging in false advertising or price fixing, then legal action should be taken to protect the public.\u201d\n\nBecerra\u2019s office said in an email it had received Newsom\u2019s request and \u201cwill handle accordingly.\u201d\n\n'Encouraging news':US highway deaths fell in 2018 for second straight year\n\nThe California Energy Commission said it \u201cdoes not have any evidence that gasoline retailers fixed prices or engaged in false advertising.\u201d But it said the industry did not provide any proof that its gasoline was better than what the state requires all retailers to sell.\n\nCatherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the industry trade group is reviewing the report. But she said it was important to note California\u2019s fuel taxes and standards, which are more strict than other states, account for the first $1.07 per gallon at the pump.\n\n\u201cEveryone has to have a seat at the table to ensure policies provide adequate, affordable, reliable energy to the communities we serve,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rise of 'ghost kitchens':Here's what the online food ordering boom has produced\n\nWhile California is known for its environmentally-conscious fuel standards, the state was the seventh-largest producer of crude oil in the country in March of this year. The oil industry is a powerful force in California politics, working to halt legislation in the state Assembly earlier this year that would have limited new oil and gas production around homes and schools.\n\nBut Newsom has expressed a desire to take on the oil industry during his first year in office. In July, he fired the state\u2019s top oil and gas regulator for doubling the state\u2019s fracking permits this year.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time a governor has requested an investigation and prosecution by the Attorney General in modern history into the oil industry,\u201d said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, which has criticized the oil industry. \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty big step.\u201d", "description": "California drivers reportedly paid an average of 30 cents more per gallon in 2018.
