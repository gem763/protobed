It aligned with my values.\n\n\u201cThey are very keen to explore the sports element and being able to use their yarns to develop sportswear.\u201d\n\nSmalling did not go through the traditional academy structure with one of the big football clubs, instead setting his mind on a degree in economics.\n\nA call from Fulham changed his path and a move to Manchester United followed in 2010 and, with two Premier League titles, an FA Cup, a Europa League title and 31 England caps, football proved a wise career choice.\n\nBusiness has always fascinated Smalling though and he has found the perfect fit with a company that echoes his concerns about the environment and animal welfare.\n\n\u2018GAP IN THE MARKET\u2019\n\nWhile the carbon footprint of the soccer industry might seem at odds with his beliefs, Smalling believes there is an opportunity for clubs to embrace green technologies. Perhaps even replica kits made from pineapple fibre?\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s in its infancy,\u201d Smalling said. \u201cThere is a gap in the market. It\u2019s still early days but I\u2019m enjoying where it\u2019s headed. Sport is an obvious market and it\u2019s exciting to see where this could go.\u201d\n\nSmalling regularly uses his social media platforms to support animal welfare and environmental causes and admits it can be frustrating when he receives negative feedback from people who question his jet-set lifestyle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not perfect but I\u2019m a footballer so I\u2019m used to criticism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting into arguments.\n\n\u201cBut whether it\u2019s the environment, mental health or racism, I think players now feel more confident about sharing things. It seems quite daunting at times because you\u2019re putting yourself out there and you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re going to get back.\n\n\u201cI think through social media, people relate a lot more to footballers because they\u2019ll see them as normal people with the same issues.\u201d\n\nSmalling is not the only high-profile footballer to become a vegan, with Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero following a similar path. For him the switch was gradual, and initially for the health benefits, but animal welfare is now the main factor.\n\n\u201cOnce I knew the facts it was hard to ignore,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people are fearful about environmental issues. They say \u2018no meat\u2019 or \u2018I can\u2019t fly\u2019. But I think ultimately it\u2019s recognising that you want to make small steps.\u201d\n\nSmalling said he had been fully supported in his vegan diet at Old Trafford where, after some initial raised eyebrows and jokes, the vegan food often disappeared first.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nWhile Smalling is busy off the field with a five-month-old son and his business ventures, the day job in Italy is going well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fabulous,\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout my career I always thought it would be nice to play abroad. I definitely would have regretted it if I didn\u2019t at least try.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m contracted here until the end of the season but when I go back I think I will be a more complete player.\u201d", "description": "Chris Smalling says his early steps into veganism owed much to his wife's cooking and the fact that reducing his meat intake appeared to have a beneficial effect on his tendonitis.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445939114&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1HG", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
