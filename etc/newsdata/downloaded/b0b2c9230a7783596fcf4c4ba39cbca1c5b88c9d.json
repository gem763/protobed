Subsequently, communication from Lander to the ground stations was lost.\"\n\n\"Data is being analyzed,\" ISRO added.\n\nIndia's prime minister, Narendra Modi \u2014 who watched the final moments of the attempt \u2014 offered words of encouragement to the Chandrayaan team, which has been working on the $150 million project.\n\n\"India is proud of our scientists!\" wrote Modi on Twitter. \"They've given their best and have always made India proud. These are moments to be courageous, and courageous we will be!\"\n\nScientists were hoping to land the robotic spacecraft between two craters about 375 miles from the moon's unexplored south pole.\n\nThe lander was supposed to release a small solar-powered rover equipped with instruments to collect and analyze the moon's 4-billion-year-old soil.\n\nA successful touchdown would have vaulted India into an exclusive club of countries that have successfully completed a soft landing on the lunar surface. So far, only the former Soviet Union, the United States and China have accomplished it.\n\nSeveral of the early U.S. and Soviet attempts at a soft, robotic, landing on the moon in the 1960s were unsuccessful.\n\nPart of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, an orbiter, remains in operation.\n\nSaturday's disappointing lunar mission comes a little more than a decade after India launched the Chandrayaan-1, a satellite that fired a projectile into the moon's South Pole in search of water.", "description": "The spacecraft's descent was going as planned until it reached an altitude of 2.1 km over the surface. \"Subsequently, communication from Lander to the ground stations was lost,\" scientists explained.", "authors": ["Vanessa Romo"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/06/ap_19249765127647_wide-d8988b45fbfc8f96c45d86e779d4246458c0fc37.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
