Furthermore, the Chinese Basketball Association president is currently Yao Ming, who played with the Rockets from 2002 to 2011. Yao\u2019s NBA success made the Rockets a favourite among Chinese fans.\n\nRockets' manager Daryl Morey ignited controversy on Friday by re-tweeting an image which was captioned: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHe deleted the tweet, and the team\u2019s owner, Tillman Fertitta, quickly distanced the team from Mr Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nMr Morey - one of the league\u2019s most visible officials on social media, with over 200,000 followers \u2013 then backtracked, stating: \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event\u201d and emphasising that his words were \u201cmy own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nHis contrition did not quell the anger, however, and Chinese sponsors announced they were withdrawing their support. Shoe company Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Card Center both said on Sunday that they were \u201cpausing their partnerships\u201d with the Rockets.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association said it was suspending cooperation with the team, and the Chinese consulate in Houston issued a statement expressing anger.\n\nThe NBA on Sunday night described Mr Morey\u2019s statement as \u201cregrettable\u201d in having \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China\u201d.\n\nThe NBA, long known as the most tolerant of sports leagues, defended Mr Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression.\n\nBut in a Chinese-language statement posted on Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese social network, the league took a different tone, saying it was \u201cextremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of Chinese basketball fans,\u201d the statement read, echoing a common trope seen in the Chinese state media.\n\nA protester is arrested in Hong Kong on Monday More\n\nThe timing is awkward for the NBA, with two of its most celebrated teams, the LA Lakers and the Nets, due to travel to the country this week to play two exhibition games.\n\nJoseph Tsai, the new co-owner of the Nets and the billionaire co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, attempted to make amends, describing Mr Morey as being ill-advised.\n\nHe referred to the protests as a \u201cseparatist movement,\u201d a common sentiment in China but a label the demonstrators deny, and framed the movement as a matter of \u201cterritorial integrity of China,\u201d though most protesters insist they are uninterested in independence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Daryl personally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been.\n\n\u201cBut the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d", "description": "China has reacted with fury after the general manager of basketball team Houston Rockets tweeted his support for the protests in Hong Kong.
