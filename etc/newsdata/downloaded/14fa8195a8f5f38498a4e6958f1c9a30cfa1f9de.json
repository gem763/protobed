It\u2019s also full of pirated material.\n\nAudius\u2019 website says \u201cmusic platforms were at their best when they listened to what artists and fans wanted - not corporations or major labels\u201d and that uploaded tracks can \u201cnever be censored or removed.\u201d TechCrunch called Audius\u2019 blockchain move its \u201csecret sauce,\u201d while Yahoo finance said it is \u201cadequately addressing the most pressing needs within the industry.\u201d But one of the most pressing problems in music right now is copyright. Audius contains infringing material \u2014 such as an unlicensed version of Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cProblem\u201d \u2014 that, if its promotional materials are right, the company cannot remove.\n\nAudius is directly competing for SoundCloud\u2019s audience, which may explain its problems. Once SoundCloud was a haven for up-and-coming artists, hosting then-unknowns such as The Chainsmokers and Lorde, but it also hosted a lot of infringing material: remixes, mashups, and often entire songs. Although SoundCloud had a content ID system in place since 2011, it began more rigorously enforcing copyright complaints after inking deals with labels, often with haphazard results, so hardcore users started looking elsewhere. In trying to appeal to these users, Audius is running into the same problems.\n\n\u201cThey say \u2018We don\u2019t have the ability to deplatform you or censor you.\u2019 What I hear when I read that is, \u2018It\u2019s going to be real difficult for us to take down anything that you put up,\u2019\u201d says Kevin Casini, a professor of entertainment law at the Quinnipiac School of Law in Connecticut. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to speak as if they\u2019re talking to people who are afraid of this bogeyman intermediary. And they\u2019re also saying, \u2018Hey, this is a new spot where you can, at least for a brief amount of time, upload something, and we\u2019re not going to look at it and see what it is.\u2019 It seems that they know this is something that is going to happen quickly for them, and they\u2019re signaling and advertising to the people that actually know what they\u2019re saying, which is: \u2018You can come here and do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAudius contains infringing material that, if its promotional materials are right, the company cannot remove\n\nAudius says it\u2019s aiming at the up-and-comers who once would have used SoundCloud. \u201cWe really see ourselves getting into the same niche as SoundCloud right now,\u201d Audius CEO Roneil Rumburg tells The Verge. Audius might even have a shot at it. Indie artists\u2019 hackles were raised by a self-monetization contract rolled out by SoundCloud that allowed it to change payment terms without notification and blocked artists from ever suing the company.\n\nBut the problem is, all of the things Audius says it\u2019s solving with the blockchain \u2014 a more direct line between fans and artists, discovery, self-monetizing \u2014 can be done without the blockchain. In fact, this is being done without the blockchain on Bandcamp and Patreon, among others.\n\nThere are real problems in the music industry: bad and non-standardized metadata, missing contributor credits, unidentified recordings that need to be matched, copyright infringement in every shape and form, and lack of sophisticated audio fingerprinting tools. Human errors with metadata mean musicians miss out on routine payments, for instance. Just recently, a scammer was able to put an unreleased Kanye West album on Apple Music as ringtones. Artist imposters are able to profit off others\u2019 work on streaming services by simply mislabeling songs or making adjustments to the audio, like slightly pitching a song up or down.\n\nBlockchain solves none of this and, in some cases, makes it worse.\n\n\u201cOn the surface, a lot of people think, \u2018blockchain is perfect for this,\u2019\u201d says Jack Spallone, senior product manager at ConsenSys. \u201cNot quite. If [the music industry] could use Excel really well, it might not even be an issue.\u201d\n\nBlockchains make piracy more of a headache.\n\nAudius is trying to avoid SoundCloud\u2019s copyright issues by not hosting the user-uploaded content itself. Its open-source protocol, built on blockchain, means that the responsibility of hosting and making uploaded content available is spread out among people who register as node operators. They say this method should protect them from liability and the claws of major labels. This is actually an open question. Copying and distribution initiated by the user but carried out by a system has insulated some companies in the past, but it has not been a sufficient argument for others.\n\nthere is also no way to file an infringement claim on the website\n\nThere are other red flags with how Audius is set up: the company confirmed to The Verge that there is no content ID system in place to catch potential infringement. Though individual uploaders can be held liable for infringement, there\u2019s no way for Audius to remove infringing material, and there is also no way to file an infringement claim on the website. \u201cA formal process is in the works,\u201d a company representative said.\n\nWhether this business model holds up in court or not, lawsuits from major publishers or labels could easily wipe out Audius\u2019 capital. And if you\u2019re buried with lawsuits, you have no money for anything else. It remains to be seen how labels and other rights holders will react to Audius, which has, in a short time, become saturated with infringing material.\n\nOriginal Ed Sheeran songs are available to play on Audius right now, along with songs registered to labels like Dim Mak and Spinnin\u2019 and scores of unsanctioned remixes using material from the likes of Kanye West and Eric Prydz. None of these artists are getting paid for this use. In fact, Audius says, no one at all is getting paid yet. The implementation of payments is slated \u201cTBD as sometime next year,\u201d Rumburg says.\n\nEven if Audius isn\u2019t directly liable for infringement, it can still be held secondarily liable if a court finds it promotes \u201cits use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement.\u201d\n\nExperts are skeptical about whether being on the blockchain is enough to protect Audius from washing their hands of bad actors. Historically, services like Grokster used similar arguments. After all, Grokster didn\u2019t host any material; it only allowed the means for people to share files with each other. But it lost that fight in the Supreme Court, and it shut down in 2005. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the early peer to peer services said too and it didn\u2019t super work out for them,\u201d says John Bergmayer, legal director at Public Knowledge.\n\nExperts are skeptical if Audius\u2019 model is enough to wash their hands of bad actors\n\nAudius views its role essentially as an open-source software producer, Rumburg says. \u201cWe basically give artists and listeners the tools they need to interact with one another directly. We help steward that community but we\u2019re not actively posting content or operating the code.\u201d\n\nI ask Bergmayer if that\u2019s enough to protect the company. \u201cI\u2019m all for a looser copyright system, but I don\u2019t want people to put forward these legal arguments that have lost,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there is an underlying direct infringer and you\u2019re doing something, anything at all, now or in the past that in some way facilitates that, there is probable claim against you.\u201d\n\nOut of all of the different types of art that can be protected with copyright, music is one of the messiest to deal with. To start, every song has two copyrights: one for the composition and one for the recording. Most songs have a lot of people and entities that need to get paid on both sides every time a song is played \u2014 from the record label to the songwriters to the people actually performing the song.\n\nHere\u2019s an example originally used by Annie Lin, senior corporate counsel at Twitch: Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cFirework.\u201d Capitol Records owns the recording for \u201cFirework,\u201d but five different songwriters with five different music publishers own percentages of the composition rights. Most existing music works this way; imagine the logistical difficulties of convincing everyone from hundreds of territories around the world, which all have varying copyright laws, to switch over to blockchain.\n\nBut can Audius attract an audience?\n\nThis is probably why Audius is taking the SoundCloud route. The easiest way for blockchain to be used with music streaming services is to focus on controlled compositions \u2014 that is, songs that are written, owned, and controlled by a single entity (i.e., many up-and-coming artists). That market\u2019s still a sliver of music as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, focusing on such a niche market means facing the economic reality of competing with the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, and, yes, SoundCloud, all of which have licensing deals in place with the majors to provide massive catalogs. People are already getting music on these services for $10 a month, so convincing them to sign up for another service without any of their favorite popular artists is tough.\n\n\u201cOkay, well, we won\u2019t deal with the majors,\u201d says George Howard, associate professor of music business / management at Berklee College of Music and Brown University, describing this general strategy. \u201cWe\u2019ll just stand up some music thing with a bunch of artists nobody\u2019s ever heard of and wonder why the fuck nobody comes to our thing because they don\u2019t understand network effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand copyright law\u201d\n\nThere are other problems facing any blockchain-based music streaming service. How can a copyright holder identify who is hosting the infringing work other than by issuing a subpoena? How can the service comply with a DMCA notice when content is immutably embedded in a blockchain? What liability does a node operator face for hosting infringing material, which the operator may not have uploaded? Or users for uploading it?\n\nBlockchain technology might be useful in some cases in music. For instance, it could create scarcity with limited edition digital releases or be used to reward and share revenue with fans, like Imogen Heap did on her last tour. But using it for a music streaming service is unnecessary, and claiming that it\u2019s a solution for any of the biggest issues facing musicians is simply untrue. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand copyright law,\u201d Howard says of Audius. \u201cThey have a barrier to assume evil with the big stakeholders, and that\u2019s just going to crash and burn. The problem with it is that, yet again, it sends a signal that blockchain and music doesn\u2019t work.\u201d", "description": "New startup Audius says its blockchain-based music streaming service is the solution that finally pays attention to indie artists\u2019 needs.
