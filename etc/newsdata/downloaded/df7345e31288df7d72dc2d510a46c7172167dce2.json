Beijing did not specify the value of the goods that face higher tariffs from Sunday.\n\nThe extra tariffs of 5% and 10% were levied on 1,717 items of a total of 5,078 products originating from the United States. Beijing will start collecting additional tariffs on the rest from Dec. 15.\n\nSteve Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said on Sunday the new tariffs were \u201cjust in time for our most important selling season of the year. They claim that they are hurting China but, in reality, they are hurting us. Prices will go up, sales will go down, jobs will be lost.\u201d\n\nHe said the United States \u201ccan make progress with China when we engage with them in calm, productive talks, not when we make it more expensive for Americans to get dressed everyday.\u201d\n\nTrump on Sunday cited comments from U.S. economist Peter Morici, who said the tariffs would not affect U.S. consumers that much given a drop in the Chinese currency, and the president called on U.S. companies to find suppliers outside of China.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be servants to the Chinese!\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is about American Freedom. Redirect the supply chain. There is no reason to buy everything from China!\u201d\n\nLater, he told reporters that talks with China were continuing and the two sides would meet in person in September.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to China, the meeting is still on, as you know, in September,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens, but we can\u2019t allow China to rip us off anymore as a country.\u201d\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Trump was right to confront China, but \u201cunfortunately, he\u2019s done it the wrong way. To take on China, there has to be a multilateral approach. One country can\u2019t take on China to try to dry up its overcapacity because they just send it through to you in other ways.\u201d\n\nCHINA REACTS\n\nChinese state media struck a defiant note.\n\n\u201cThe United States should learn how to behave like a responsible global power and stop acting as a \u2018school bully,\u2019\u201d the official Xinhua news agency said.\n\n\u201cAs the world\u2019s only superpower, it needs to shoulder its due responsibility, and join other countries in making this world a better and more prosperous place. Only then can America become great again.\u201d\n\nTariffs could not impede China\u2019s development, said the official People\u2019s Daily of the ruling Communist Party.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s booming economy has made China a fertile ground for investment that foreign companies cannot ignore,\u201d it said, in a commentary under the name \u2018Zhong Sheng,\u2019 or \u2018Voice of China,\u2019 which is often used to state its view on foreign policy issues.\n\nLast month, Trump said he was increasing existing and planned tariffs by 5% on about $550 billion worth of Chinese imports after Beijing announced its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nTariffs of 15% on cellphones, laptop computers, toys and clothing are to take effect on Dec. 15.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office said on Thursday it would collect public comments through Sept. 20 on a planned tariff increase to 30% on a $250 billion list of goods already hit with a 25% tariff set for Oct. 1.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar and China yuan notes are seen in this picture illustration June 2, 2017.
