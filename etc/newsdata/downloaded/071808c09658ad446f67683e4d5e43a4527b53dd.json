Bolton, while intense speculation mounted over President Trump\u2019s pick to replace him.\n\nIran and Israel shared a rare moment of agreement, with Tehran fearing and Jerusalem hoping that the U.S. \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Iran is unlikely to soften with Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cI have no doubts at all that, in any situation \u2026 President Trump and his administration will be very, very tough with Iran,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a television interview, citing U.S. sanctions announced against Tehran on Tuesday, just after Mr. Trump declared he had fired Mr. Bolton.\n\nWith Mr. Trump telling reporters he already has a list of five possible candidates and will decide next week, world leaders watched closely for signs of whether the pick will be someone with less of a hard-liner bent toward adversaries such as North Korea and Iran.\n\nMr. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are the ones who \u201ccrafted the American policy\u201d toward Iran, Mr. Netanyahu said.\n\nBut there was renewed speculation that the departure of Mr. Bolton, long an advocate for regime change in Tehran, could pave the way for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session this month.\n\nIn Iran, Mr. Rouhani said the Trump administration \u201cshould understand that warmongering and warmongers have no benefit and the warmongers should be set aside,\u201d according to Iranian state media reports.\n\nAbbas Ali Kadkhodaei, a spokesman for Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s Guardian Council, said Mr. Bolton\u2019s ouster would not ease tensions. \u201cThe U.S. hostile and arrogant policies do not change by one person\u2019s dismissal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton\u2019s ouster shows [the] failure of Trump\u2019s policy of pressure and admission of the fact that warmonger Bolton had closed his eyes on realities,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMr. Trump, who has Mr. Bolton\u2019s deputy, Charles Kupperman, filling in as interim national security adviser, has not revealed who may be on the short list as a permanent replacement.\n\nNorth Korean policy\n\nNorth Korea may be the one aspect of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy most affected by Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure.\n\nThe president told reporters that Mr. Bolton \u201cwasn\u2019t in line\u201d with his precedent-shattering personal diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and said Pyongyang was rightly angered when Mr. Bolton in April 2018 floated the \u201cLibya model\u201d for ending the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programs in the run-up to Mr. Trump\u2019s first summit with Mr. Kim in Singapore.\n\nLibyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi lost first his power and then his life in a coup after agreeing to give up his nuclear programs in exchange for economic relief in a 2004 deal with the U.S. and Britain.\n\n\u201cHe talked about the Libyan model for Kim Jong-un,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat was not a good statement to make. You just take a look at what happened with Gadhafi. That was not a good statement to make. And it set us back.\u201d\n\nAlthough there was no official reaction on the tightly controlled North Korean state press, the Kim regime \u201cmust be thrilled at the firing of John Bolton,\u201d said Srinivasan Sitaraman, a North Korea analyst at Clark University in Massachusetts. \u201cKim resented Bolton\u2019s maximalist positions on nuclear negotiations and his use of the \u2018Libyan model\u2019 as an analogy.\n\n\u201cKim [also] heaped ire on Bolton and partly held him responsible for torpedoing the Hanoi summit,\u201d Mr. Sitaraman said. \u201cNow that Bolton is out of the way and as the U.N. General Assembly gets underway next week in New York, there is no one to stop Mr. Trump from making a deal with North Korea.\u201d\n\n\u201cNorth Korea will apparently welcome Trump\u2019s ouster of Bolton, as the hawkish figure has long been seen as a thorn in its side from the North\u2019s viewpoint,\u201d Park Won-gon, a professor of international relations at Handong Global University, told the Seoul-based Korean Times. \u201cThis is a positive sign in terms of resuming the nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Park warned that Mr. Bolton at times provided useful reality checks on his boss\u2019 desire to cut a deal with the North.\n\nWhile not remarking on the change in Washington, North Korea did reveal Wednesday that it had tested a \u201csuper-large\u201d multiple rocket launcher a day earlier. South Korea\u2019s military said the North had fired two short-range projectiles eastward from its western region.\n\nDiplomatic opening\n\nIn Europe, some saw an opening for an improved tone in diplomacy with Washington now that Mr. Bolton is gone.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity, not least for the trans-Atlantic relationship,\u201d Norbert Roettgen, chairman of the foreign policy commission of the German parliament and a senior lawmaker from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party, told France24.\n\nMr. Bolton was also a noted skeptic of Russia, but Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Novosti news agency that he had \u201cno expectation\u201d that relations with the U.S. would alter anytime soon.\n\nBut Mr. Bolton was a strong backer of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to renounce the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and a skeptic of Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to welcome Russia back into the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, and some in Russia saw his departure as a positive development.\n\nMr. Bolton \u201calways opposed agreements on strategic stability and arms control, believing that they unnecessarily limit the U.S. and prevent them from demonstrating their superiority,\u201d Sen. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Federation Council\u2019s Committee on Foreign Affairs, told The Moscow Times. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Trump fired Bolton for this reason, but it\u2019s for this reason that I\u2019m definitely not going to grieve about his dismissal.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton was also a visible advocate for regime change in Venezuela. He strongly supported opposition leader Juan Guaido\u2019s challenge to socialist President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nMr. Trump was reportedly frustrated that Mr. Bolton\u2019s argument that the Maduro government \u2014 still clinging to power in Caracas \u2014 would topple quickly in the face of U.S. sanctions and an oil embargo.\n\n\u201cI disagreed with John Bolton on his attitudes on Venezuela,\u201d Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \u201cI thought he was way out of line, and I think I\u2019ve proven to be right.\u201d\n\nMr. Maduro has been quiet so far, but a senior official in the Maduro government expressed delight over Mr. Bolton\u2019s ouster.\n\n\u201cOn days like this, the Comandante would treat himself to some sweet papaya,\u201d the unidentified official told The Associated Press \u2014 a reference to the late anti-U.S. populist President Hugo Chavez\u2019s fondness for a traditional Venezuelan dessert.\n\nBut as with many other issues, Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure leaves major questions on where U.S. policy on Venezuela goes from here.\n\n\u201cMaduro is likely thinking \u2018good riddance\u2019 and that this is sweet revenge for all the macho posturing,\u201d said Chris Sabatini, senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House in London. \u201cBut that would be a mistake. Bolton\u2019s strategy was flawed from the beginning, and his departure may pave the way to bring in a more professional, effective diplomat that could be a greater threat to Maduro\u2019s autocracy.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Tom Howell contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
