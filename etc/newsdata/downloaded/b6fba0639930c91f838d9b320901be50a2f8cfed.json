Elizabeth Warren is backing Jumaane Williams for reelection as public advocate.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator and top-tier presidential candidate sent out a fundraising email Tuesday for Williams, who is up against Republican City Council Member Joe Borelli in next week\u2019s election.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cJumaane has been an outstanding Public Advocate since his historic election in February, but his pro-Trump, special-interest-backed opponent is trying to undo all the progress we\u2019ve made,\u201d she wrote, asking supporters to chip in $30 for the public advocate\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days, I\u2019m going to do everything I can to ensure Jumaane is re-elected \u2014 not just because he\u2019s a dear friend, but because I believe in his ability to make New York City an even better place to live,\u201d Warren added.\n\nWilliams was elected in a special election earlier this year to replace now-Attorney General Tish James, but must win again in the general election to keep the seat.

He went to a rally Warren held in Washington Square Park last month, but told POLITICO he was between endorsing her or Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nBorelli, the Republican nominee, is one of the few full-throated supporters of President Donald Trump in city politics, and is running on a platform of abolishing the largely powerless public advocate\u2019s office unless it is given more authority.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want the support of someone who\u2019s promising to punish the middle class with new taxes, but I suppose there may be one out of every 1,024 voters who disagree,\u201d he said, in a swipe at Warren\u2019s release of a DNA test finding she had a small percentage of Native American heritage.\n\nIn response to Warren\u2019s attack on his support for Trump, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see Elizabeth Warren has been watching me on Fox.\u201d", "description": "Williams has not made an endorsement in the presidential race.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/50/05/c597006e400484b2361108dd2cbf/ap-19068027403974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
