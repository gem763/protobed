Only out there can you feel the greatness \u2013 the huge size of all that surrounds us.\u2019\n\nThe pioneering mission nearly ended in tragedy when his suit inflated, leaving in unable to fit back into his spacecraft.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAlexei Leonov floated in space for about 12 minutes attached by a cord (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe made history by becoming the first human to walk in space (Picture: REX)\n\nAs his suit became looser around his body he couldn\u2019t pull himself back with the cord and it was impossible to get into the airlock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe nearly starved himself of oxygen by letting air out of his suit through a valve to get back inside.\n\nWhen it was time to return to earth, the re-entry rockets failed, meaning they had to fire them manually.\n\nThe move should have separated the landing capsule, but something went wrong and the rest of the craft was still being dragged behind them as they plummeted in a spinning motion.\n\nOnly the heat from re-entry saved them, after burning through a communications cable and releasing them from the orbital module they were dragging behind them.\n\nThe team landed in a remote woodland area in Siberia with -25C temperatures which is home to bears and wolves.\n\nBut the reality of the dangers faced by the crew only emerged many years later.\n\nHis funeral will take place at a military cemetery in Moscow on Tuesday (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAlexei Leonov and US crew commander Thomas Stafford shake hands in July 1975 (Picture: NASA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHe scraped with death multiple times on his first trip into space (Picture: Sovfoto/Universal Images Group/REX)\n\nHe went back to space 10 years later, commanding the Soviet Union\u2019s half of the Apollo-Soyuz 19 mission.\n\nIt was a joint effort with the United States carried out at the height of the Cold War.\n\nTwo Russian crew members on the International Space Station paid tribute to Mr Leonov two days before his 85th birthday.\n\nThey ventured into open space with stickers attached to their spacesuits paying tribute to the astronaut and congratulated him from space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoscosmos said Mr Leonov\u2019s funeral will take place on Tuesday at a military cemetery outside Moscow.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
