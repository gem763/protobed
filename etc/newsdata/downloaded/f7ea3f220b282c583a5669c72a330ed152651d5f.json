It\u2019s the cadre of government workers who are working against the Trump administration in the shadows. They hate the president and will do anything to push back at all costs. It also doesn\u2019t help that there were oodles of Obama holdovers when Trump was inaugurated in 2017.\n\nAnyway, the point is that there is ample evidence that there is a deep state working against the Trump White House. Its members are not really known to the public, and The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Kimberley Strassel details how this anti-democratic club is a cancer to the country in her new book \u201cResistance at All Costs: How Trump Haters are Breaking America.\u201d\n\nStrassel notes that former CIA Director John Brennan and fired FBI Director James Comey are some of the folks used as examples of deep state antics. Their conduct was less than honorable; Comey\u2019s was worthy of termination, which Trump promptly did in May 2017. The Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general report makes that quite clear. Yet, she notes these are political appointments that are subject to scrutiny and can be removed.\n\nThe proper Deep State is made up of those who work in secret, are not known to the public, and are virtually impossible to fire. We\u2019re in the swampy bureaucracy on this one, and they\u2019ve caught a nasty algae bloom in the form of Trump Derangement Syndrome, causing them to infest and rot the very institutions that they work for and have sworn to uphold in their oaths as civil servants. They work for us. Their duty is to serve the country, not act like Dumbledore\u2019s Army working to sabotage policies the American people wanted with the 2016 election results. I know, please forgive the Harry Potter reference, but it seems it\u2019s the only book the Left has read in the last 10-15 years.\n\nStrassel notes that the Fort Sumter moment for this band of undemocratic clowns was when Yates defied Trump. She did it, so should we\u2014and alas, this is where we are in this town (via WSJ):\n\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Yates became acting attorney general on Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and Loretta Lynch\u2019s resignation. A week later, the president signed an executive order restricting travel from seven Middle Eastern and African countries. Ms. Yates instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the order in court on the grounds that she was not convinced it was \u201cconsistent\u201d with the department\u2019s \u201cresponsibilities\u201d or even \u201clawful.\u201d She decreed: \u201cFor as long as I am Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order.\u201d Mr. Trump fired her that day, but he shouldn\u2019t have had to. Her obligation was to defend the executive order, or to resign if she felt she couldn\u2019t. Nobody elected Sally Yates. The Yates memo was the first official act of the internal resistance\u2014not only a precedent but a rallying cry. Subordinates fawningly praised her in emails obtained by Judicial Watch. \u201cYou are my new hero,\u201d wrote one federal prosecutor. Another department colleague emailed: \u201cThank you AG Yates. I\u2019ve been in civil/appellate for 30 years and have never seen an administration with such contempt for democratic values and the rule of law.\u201d Andrew Weissmann\u2014a career department lawyer, then head of the Criminal Fraud Division and later on the staff of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2014wrote: \u201cI am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much.\u201d Ms. Yates set an example to rebels throughout the government: If she can defy the president, why can\u2019t I? That mentality fed the stream of leaks that has flowed ever since. The office of Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, made a study of Mr. Trump\u2019s first 18 weeks in office. It found the administration had \u201cfaced 125 leaked stories\u2014one leak a day\u2014containing information that is potentially damaging to national security under the standards laid out in a 2009 Executive Order signed by President Barack Obama. \u201d Nearly 80% focused on the Russia probe, and many revealed \u201cclosely-held information such as intelligence community intercepts, FBI interviews and intelligence, grand jury subpoenas, and even the workings of a secret surveillance court.\u201d Unauthorized disclosure of classified information is a felony. Employees also started using social media to \u201cresist.\u201d A National Parks Service employee had already used an official Twitter account to troll Mr. Trump, passing along a post that showed side-by-side comparison of the crowd at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and the larger one at Mr. Obama\u2019s. Around the time of the Yates firing, someone in the Pentagon set up the Twitter account @Rogue_DOD, on which was posted a damaging opinion piece about Trump and internal documents about climate change. A former employee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up @viralCDC, with the description: \u201cThe unofficial \u2018Resistance\u2019 page of the CDC.\u201d Its pinned tweet read: \u201cIf they choose to make facts controversial, the purveyors of facts must step into the controversy. #ScienceMarch #resist.\u201d These details come from a Jan. 31, 2017, Washington Post story, which reported that \u201c180 federal employees have signed up for a workshop next weekend, where experts will offer advice on workers\u2019 rights and how they can express civil disobedience.\u201d At the State Department, resisters organized a \u201ccable\u201d protesting Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban. It worked its way through dozens of U.S. embassies and ultimately had at least 1,000 signatures. The cable was part of a \u201cdissent channel\u201d that Foggy Bottom maintains to allow officials to disagree with policy, and it is meant to be confidential. The resisters made the letter public, bragging about the numbers of signers and anonymously slamming Mr. Trump.\n\nSo, you can see that Yates ignited a spark that set off this brushfire. The leaks, the dishonesty, the backstabbing, and the overall unhinged disposition of the professional Left in D.C. has caused damage to the country. Why should anyone trust these clowns? What\u2019s the point of participating in the election process when its institutions are being corrupted by a self-righteous caucus of government workers who think they can quarterback policy they feel is right because of their paycheck? That\u2019s the point Strassel aptly makes.\n\nStrassel also exposes the idiotic nature of the Left\u2019s argument against Trump. They think he\u2019s illegitimate due to the Russian collusion myth, but moreover, the nauseating claim that it was Hillary\u2019s time. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t, which is why she\u2019s a two-time presidential loser. Too bad\u2014they don\u2019t get to make that call. Their job, as Strassel noted, is to serve the government. Pass the memos and paper along and shut the hell up. If they can\u2019t handle that, then resign. But alas, they won\u2019t. They\u2019re taking the \u2018we need to burn the village to save it\u2019 approach, which again exposes how insane and stupid this progressive warrior class has become.", "description": ".10/17/2019 21:04:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/283/807baa68-fabd-4bc0-9952-5cc3f569b468.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
