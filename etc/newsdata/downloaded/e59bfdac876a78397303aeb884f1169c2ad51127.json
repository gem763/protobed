REUTERS/Satish Kumar/File Photo\n\nTV Globo reported on Tuesday that on March 14, 2018, the day of the murder, the suspect told a doorman he was going to Bolsonaro\u2019s house, gaining access to a gated community where he met instead with another former police officer accused of murdering the left-wing politician Marielle Franco.\n\nThe case led to widespread protests by Brazilians outraged to see a black, openly gay human rights advocate gunned down. Investigators arrested two former police officers Ronnie Lessa and Elcio de Queiroz nearly a year later and charged them with killing her in return for about $50,000. Their lawyers said they did not commit the crime.\n\nBolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, 2019, denied any connection to the case. He said he was in Brasilia the day of the murder voting in Congress, where he was then serving as a deputy. TV Globo\u2019s report said that Bolsonaro was in Brasilia the day of Franco\u2019s murder.\n\nThe president accused the media and a former ally of conspiring to attack him and his family.\n\n\u201cThis is rotten, villainous journalism by TV Globo,\u201d an enraged Bolsonaro said in a live video on social media, recorded at 4 a.m. in Saudi Arabia during an official visit.\n\nBolsonaro went on to discuss the timeline for renewing the license of the network, which is part of Grupo Globo, the largest media group in Brazil that includes TV, publishing, internet content and music labels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk in 2022,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope I\u2019m dead by then, because the renewal process won\u2019t be persecution, but ... there won\u2019t be any workarounds for you or anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Globo expressed regret about Bolsonaro\u2019s comments and said its aim was to inform the Brazilian public. Referring to its license renewal, it said that it had complied with its obligations during the past 54 years.\n\nTV Globo said the doorman to Bolsonaro\u2019s gated community in Rio told police that someone in the Bolsonaro residence identified as \u201cMr. Jair\u201d confirmed the visitor on the day of Franco\u2019s murder and then waved off the doorman\u2019s concern that the car went to a different house.\n\n\u201cIt looks like either the doorman lied or someone induced him to commit a false testimony,\u201d Bolsonaro said on Tuesday.\n\nHe accused Rio state Governor Wilson Witzel of leaking details from a confidential investigation to the press to \u201cdestroy the Bolsonaro family\u201d before the 2022 presidential elections.\n\nRelated Coverage Brazil justice minister calls for investigation into testimony linking Bolsonaro to murder case\n\nWitzel denied any political interference with the investigation. \u201cI deeply regret the untimely reaction of President Jair Bolsonaro,\u201d the governor said in a statement.\n\nBolsonaro later told journalists in front of his hotel in Riyadh that he was asking Justice Minister Sergio Moro to question the doorman again, according to press reports.\n\nInvestigators have still not answered the question of who paid for the assassination. In September, Brazil\u2019s top prosecutor charged five people including police officers and a former state lawmaker with sabotaging the investigation.", "description": "President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday he could cancel the license of Brazil's largest TV network Globo after it reported an allegation connecting him with a former police officer accused of the killing of a Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman last year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446573220&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1EG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
