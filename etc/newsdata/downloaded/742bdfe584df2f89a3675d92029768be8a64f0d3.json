An FTC investigation revealed that some Truly Organic products contained no organic ingredients at all, and others contained ingredients that were not vegan, including honey and lactose, according to the FTC complaint.\n\n\u201cThis conduct distorted competition for organic products, inflicting harm on honest producers,\u201d FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a statement. Truly Organic and CEO Maxx Appelman also \u201charmed consumers, some of whom may have purchased their products for health reasons,\u201d it added.\n\nThe case is the latest reminder to shoppers to read labels with a skeptical eye, and to think twice before shelling out extra money for products whose labels are brimming with buzzwords. Consumers are increasingly drawn to products whose labels tout \u201cclean\u201d attributes such as organic or cruelty-free, a 2017 analysis by market research firm Nielsen found. And they\u2019re willing to pay more for brands that market themselves as \u201csustainable,\u201d a broad term that can include organic, a previous Nielsen report found.\n\nBut government regulators only monitor some of these claims, so it\u2019s often up to consumers to make sure they\u2019re getting what they pay for.\n\n\u2018As organic as possible\u2019\n\nTruly Organic did not admit or deny any of the allegations in the complaint under the terms of the settlement. \u201cWe have decided to settle the lawsuit in order to focus on our brand, products, customers and to avoid the distraction of prolonged litigation,\u201d Truly Organic founder and CEO Maxx Appelman told MarketWatch in an email.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always and will always be to create healthy, vegan, clean products that are high performing and offer a luxurious experience.\u201d Appelman said his company\u2019s first priority is affordability, and that the brand strives to make products that are \u201cas organic as possible while being as effective as possible.\u201d\n\nHow shoppers can tell whether a product is really organic\n\nShoppers who want to ensure they\u2019re buying organic food should look for the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s certified seal, which means the product has been vetted by USDA\u2019s National Organics Program.\n\nBut even that\u2019s not always a guarantee, said Katherine Paul of the Organic Consumers Association. \u201cA handful of \u2018bad actors,\u2019 and occasionally some certifiers, do not strictly adhere to USDA regulations,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we continue to pressure the USDA on stronger regulations and better enforcement, and recommend that consumers conduct their own due diligence when possible, when shopping for certified organic products.\u201d\n\nSee also: Beech-Nut baby food and Twinings Tea contain traces of a chemical linked to cancer \u2014 should you be concerned?\n\nBeauty products are a different matter. The Food and Drug Administration doesn\u2019t define or regulate the term \u201corganic\u201d for beauty products. (But if those products contain agricultural ingredients, they can be regulated by the USDA, a USDA spokeswoman said.)\n\nShoppers on the hunt for organic beauty products should read the label carefully, said Gay Timmons, president of the Natural and Organic Health and Beauty Alliance. If it says the product is organic, there should be a certificate and a statement on the back of the bottle that explains which certifier vetted the product, she told MarketWatch.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no federal certification for organic beauty products, the state of California certifies products, and so do some individual retailers and nonprofit organizations like the U.K.\u2019s Soil Association and EcoCert in France.\n\nTips for verifying vegan products\n\nAs for vegan products, the USDA doesn\u2019t certify products as vegan \u2014 meaning they contain no animal byproducts whatsoever \u2014 and neither does any other government agency. The animal advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals maintains an app and online database of vegan, non-animal-tested products that\u2019s grown from 12 companies in 1987 to more than 4,000 currently, said PETA senior vice president Kathy Guillermo.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of lies are rare \u2014 but they do occur,\u201d Guillermo said of the FTC\u2019s complaint against Truly Organic. \u201cMost company executives are either more ethical or more realistic about getting caught. We support the FTC\u2019s important work here, which is crucial for both consumers and animals.\u201d\n\nTruly Organic customers could get refunds\n\nTruly Organic sells its products at Nordstrom JWN, -0.74%, Urban Outfitters URBN, -0.58%, on Ulta.com ULTA, -0.11% and on Aerie.com ANF, -1.97%. None of those companies responded to requests for comment from MarketWatch. The product line includes a rainbow-hued Unicorn Fruit Body Butter for $20 and a $30 CBD \u201cglow serum.\u201d\n\nThe FTC complaint said Truly Organic\u2019s products fall into two categories: \u201cproducts that they \u2018make\u2019 by purchasing wholesale bath, beauty, and home products online, adding ingredients to increase visual appeal, and repackaging; and \u2018bath bombs\u2019 and soaps that they purchase as finished products from online wholesalers and resell at a substantial markup.\u201d\n\nThe FTC gives refunds to consumers harmed by deceptive marketing claims, and the court order in the Truly Organic case indicates shoppers may get some money back. The FTC\u2019s law-enforcement actions led to more than $2.3 billion in refunds for consumers between July 2017 and June 2018, according to the agency. In April, it handed out nearly $515,000 to consumers who paid for unproven \u201camniotic stem cell therapy.\u201d", "description": "A brand sold at Nordstrom and Urban Outfitters \u2018harmed consumers,\u2019 the FTC said.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS070_organi_ZG_20190925163306.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
