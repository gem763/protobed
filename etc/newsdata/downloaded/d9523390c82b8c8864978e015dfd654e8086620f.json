Its design fits right into the company\u2019s lineup of gaming-focused laptops, but this one is built specifically for creative professionals who demand especially high-end specs and who have a lot of money to spend.\n\nThe only configuration that\u2019s currently available costs $3,999 and comes in \u201cmercury white,\u201d which looks silver. Its 15.6-inch touchscreen is a 4K OLED with a 1ms response time that covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. For its processor, Razer selected the 9th Gen Intel Core i7-9750H hexa-core CPU. Inside, you\u2019ll find Nvidia\u2019s Quadro RTX 5000 Studio Edition graphics card with a whopping 16GB of video RAM.\n\nRTX Studio GPUs can handle ray tracing, but they aren\u2019t meant for gaming\n\nRazer\u2019s Blade 17 Pro Studio Edition is also on its way, and it will feature a 4K display with an impressive 120Hz refresh rate, along with the same Quadro RTX 5000 GPU. While the 15-inch Studio laptop tops out at the 6-core i7-9750H, the 17-inch Pro model can be configured with a more powerful 8-core i9-9880H processor. So if you need more oomph (or a larger screen and wired Ethernet jack), that may be the one to wait for. Whether that one features a 4K OLED screen remains to be seen, but those haven\u2019t kicked off like 15-inch OLED panels have, as seen most recently in the Dell XPS 15.\n\nThis Blade 15 Studio Edition is one of 17 machines that are part of Nvidia\u2019s RTX Studio initiative and are fitted with Nvidia\u2019s RTX Studio graphics cards. That includes Nvidia Studio, a suite of APIs, SDKs, and drivers that are specifically tuned for those RTX Studio GPU. Despite RTX Studio GPUs being able to handle ray tracing, these aren\u2019t meant for gaming. Instead, they\u2019re meant for creative applications that demand a huge amount of graphics processing. You don\u2019t have to spend nearly this much money to get a very powerful Razer gaming laptop with a gaming-focused RTX graphics card.\n\nBy default, this machine comes with 32GB of DDR4 RAM, but it\u2019s expandable up to 64GB. Razer includes a 1TB NVMe PCIe SSD, though it supports up to 2TB in the M.2 2280 form factor.\n\nMost of the ports are what you\u2019d expect to get from a modern Razer gaming laptop. There\u2019s a Thunderbolt 3 port, which is all but essential if you\u2019re transferring large files. It also has three USB Type-A 3.2 (Gen 2) ports, a Mini DisplayPort socket, and HDMI 2.0b. Something unique in this Studio Edition laptop is an SD card reader that supports fast UHS-III speeds.\n\nThe Razer Blade 15 Studio Edition is available from Razer\u2019s online store.", "description": "Razer\u2019s new creative-focused laptop is the Blade 15 Studio Edition.
