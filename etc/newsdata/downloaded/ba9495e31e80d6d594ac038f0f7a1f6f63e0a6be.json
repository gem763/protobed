What\u2019s more, Mattis has told these nations personally that the American people will never care about the lives of their children more than they do, and that it\u2019s up to them to provide more to their defense.\n\nFor a few seconds, Mitchell seemed rudderless. She began to speak as if to counter Mattis, but immediately pivoted to his resignation letter in order to change the subject.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis corrects NBC's Andrea Mitchell, says \"NATO is actually stronger today\" under President Trump. Mattis left her SPEECHLESS! pic.twitter.com/pjip4wUEYD \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) September 9, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s always fun to watch the mainstream media get its narrative\u2019s teeth figuratively kicked in as we learn the truth. Mattis has never been one to shy away from reality, and the fact that he\u2019s bringing it onto shows where they were hoping there\u2019d be something damning to attack Trump with is just hilarious.\n\nMattis is currently making the rounds to promote his new book Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead. While many seemed to think it\u2019d be an anti-Trump screed, Mattis is disappointing a lot of people.", "description": "Watch: Jim Mattis Leaves Andrea Mitchell at a Loss for Words After Torpedoing Her Anti-Trump Narrative", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Sister Toldjah", "Dan Spencer", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Brad Slager", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2b066136-6b8b-45e5-b62d-00b82c129d06.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
