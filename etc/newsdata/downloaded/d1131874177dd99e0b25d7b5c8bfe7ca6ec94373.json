DeSantis suspended Israel soon after taking office in January 2019.\n\nThe committee\u2019s decision was divided along party lines, with Democrats backing Sheriff Israel.\n\nNow that the committee has recommended Israel\u2019s removal, the full Florida Senate will vote on the matter on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t understand the magnitude of the failures by law enforcement,\u201d Ryan Petty, whose 14 year old daughter was killed in the shooting, said in testimony to the committee. \u201cThe testament to that failure is 17 dead children and teachers, 17 more with life-altering injuries \u2014 a burden we must bear forever.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s supporters urged the Senate to reinstate him. The Sheriff was elected to office in 2012.\n\n\u201cPlease be the body that doesn\u2019t turn its back on the voters of Broward County,\u201d said Patti Lynn, a backer of Israel. \u201cOur county voted for Sheriff Scott Israel. It\u2019s up to the voters of Broward County to remove him.\u201d", "description": "The Florida Senate Rules Committee on Monday recommended removing the Broward County sheriff accused of mishandling the Parkland shooting.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
