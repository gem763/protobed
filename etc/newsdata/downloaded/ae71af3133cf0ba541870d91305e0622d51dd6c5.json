Now President Trump wants to fill the moat.\n\nOver at the failing New York Times, Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis composed one of the most delightfully revealing paragraphs of the Trump era:\n\n\u201cPrivately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\u201d\n\nI picture Trump explaining to baffled aides how migrants, bleeding from gunshot wounds to their legs, could still crawl across the border, as if they weren\u2019t impoverished humans but the first wave of the Zombie Apocalypse. I picture, too, the unlucky procurement officer, tasked with producing the moat\u2019s \u201ccost estimate,\u201d calling reptile farms for bulk pricing on alligators and water moccasins:\n\n\u201cDo your alligators eat migrants?\u201d\n\n\u201cErrr. I\u2019m not sure I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind. We\u2019ll take 1 million.\u201d\n\nTrump denied the report (much like he denied inquiring about nuking hurricanes), perhaps because it made him sound like Dr. Evil proposing to mount lasers on sharks. But the alligators-and-snakes report had a ring of truth.\n\nThis is because Trump specializes in similarly clumsy strategies, most recently in battling the impeachment inquiry. Moats, alligators, snakes, flesh-piercing spikes and below-the-belt shots: It\u2019s an apt metaphor for the administration\u2019s defense as it tries to block the probe with all the subtlety and nuance of medieval siege warfare. All that\u2019s missing is the flaming pitch and diseased-animal carcasses to be launched at the Capitol from the White House South Lawn.\n\nWatch as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo builds the moat, Attorney General William Barr plays the alligator, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani acts the snake, Trump launches flesh-piercing spikes from his trebuchet \u2014 and the four of them fire shots indiscriminately at whistleblowers, civil servants and investigators.\n\nThe belligerent Pompeo, digging a trench between Trump and his inquisitors, ordered State Department officials not to provide testimony or documents to the congressional inquiry. Pompeo misled the public by implying that he knew nothing about the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, finally admitting on Wednesday that he was on the call. At the same time, Pompeo has presided over a revival of the probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, as The Post reported, this time ensnaring more people by retroactively relabeling old emails as classified.\n\nPlaying the alligator, Barr offers a (crocodilian) smile by day. But by night he submerges himself in the muck, stalking foreign officials \u2014 the Italians, the British, the Australians, the Ukrainians \u2014 for dirt that would hurt Trump\u2019s political opponents. At the heart of Barr\u2019s probe is a conspiracy theory that Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, says he long ago warned Trump had been \u201ccompletely debunked.\u201d\n\nReprising his role of snake in Trump\u2019s impeachment defense is Giuliani, who in Trump\u2019s name has given endless media interviews making the false allegation that Joe Biden bribed Ukrainian officials to get his son out of legal jeopardy. Now, The Post reports, House investigators are examining whether Giuliani has been using his work for Trump to advance his clients\u2019 interest.\n\nTrump produces the flesh-piercing barbs himself \u2014 in great quantity. He shared a warning that impeachment would \u201ccause a Civil War.\u201d On Wednesday, he told his 65 million Twitter followers that the investigation is \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d and \u201cnothing short of a coup.\u201d In the Oval Office with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, Trump sounded off about the \u201ccorrupt\u201d Biden, \u201ccrazy\u201d Nancy Pelosi and \u201cShifty Schiff,\u201d a \u201clowlife\u201d who \u201ccouldn\u2019t carry his blank-strap\u201d \u2014 apparently referring to a jockstrap. Officials, Trump said, \u201cshould look at him for treason,\u201d a capital offense.\n\nResponded Niinisto: \u201cFinland is the happiest country in the world.\u201d\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the shoot-out-their-legs technique. Trump and his team have already mowed down the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a well-regarded civil servant, who was recalled (and disparaged to Ukraine\u2019s president) after Giuliani publicly criticized her; she apparently raised concerns about Giuliani\u2019s shadow agenda in Ukraine. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. representative for Ukraine negotiations, was reportedly forced by Pompeo to resign, serving as scapegoat for Giuliani\u2019s mischief. Trump now hopes to inflict worse injuries on the whistleblower, a \u201cspy\u201d who has committed \u201ctreason\u201d worthy of execution. He claims that he is \u201centitled\u201d to \u201clearn everything about\u201d the whistleblower \u2014 dubbed by the White House a \u201csaboteur\u201d of democracy.\n\nShots fired. The snakes are slithering out of the moat. See you later, alligator.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "His cronies are putting in extra time to protect the president from impeachment.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "October At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
