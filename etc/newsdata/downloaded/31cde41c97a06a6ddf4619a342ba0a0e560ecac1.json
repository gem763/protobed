The new Amazon animated series manipulates time, space, and memory to disconcerting effect, evoking sci-fi fantasies and psychedelic fever dreams. The very look of it is surreal\u2014a blend of live-action and oil-painted rotoscope animation that roots every frame in the space between reality and what might exist beyond it. The result is one of the most original\u2014and best\u2014new shows of the season, as incisive about mental illness, inherited trauma, disability, and spirituality as it is warm, funny, and daring.\n\nFor all the metaphysical questions Undone provokes, the series grounds itself in a firmly human perspective: that of Alma (Rosa Salazar), a sharp, charming, but critically bored day care worker from San Antonio. She\u2019s only 28 but already sagging under the prospect of eking out the remaining days of her life without losing her mind. She\u2019s appealingly witty, prickly and sardonic. But she\u2019s also deeply lonely, despite regular bar meet-ups with her newly-engaged younger sister Becca (Angelique Cabral), her fussy mother Camila (Constance Marie), and Sam, the live-in boyfriend (Siddharth Dhananjay) whose sweetness and loyalty Alma is sure she\u2019s wasting. She\u2019s in need of connection, yet can\u2019t help but perpetuate her own isolation: her brain is \u201cbroken,\u201d she\u2019s convinced, and broken people hurt others. Why put anyone through that at all?\n\nAlma\u2019s routine comes to an abrupt, catastrophic halt after an emotional breakdown and a car accident one-two punch her into a coma. When she wakes, the physical dimensions of her world seem suddenly unmoored. The world whips by outside her hospital window as if she\u2019s in a moving car. The walls bleed into a picturesque forest. She begins to experience time in a loop, piecing together new revelations with every spiral. And she can now see and speak to what appears to be her dead dad, Jacob (Bob Odenkirk), who disappeared and perished one Halloween night when Alma was a child. He comes with startling news: he was murdered, he says, not killed in an accident. And he needs Alma to use her new command of non-linear time and space to figure out whodunnit.\n\nThe show\u2019s rotoscope animation\u2014in which animators trace over live-action footage, in this case with painstakingly crafted oil paintings\u2014seamlessly blends Alma\u2019s everyday world with her surreal post-coma visions. The technique is most often associated with films like Richard Linklater\u2019s Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly, but has never been used to animate a full season of serialized television. (One can see why: eight 23-minute episodes of Undone amounted to \u201cthe equivalent of two feature films\u201d executed in a year and a half, according to Dutch director Hisko Hulsing.) With rotoscoping, the show begins to move fluidly between dreams, memories, reality, and hallucinations. Then a sci-fi mystery unfolds in earnest, as we dive deep into Alma\u2019s flawed, fascinating, not-quite-\u201cbroken\u201d mind.\n\nThat Undone comes from the same team of creators behind another animated series known for its brilliantly devastating emotional and psychological insight is no surprise. Co-creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg is best known as the creator and showrunner of Netflix\u2019s BoJack Horseman. He approached staff writer Kate Purdy after the show\u2019s second season, referencing an episode she\u2019d penned the year before called \u201cDowner Ending,\u201d in which the depressive BoJack trips on drugs and envisions an alternate reality where he might have been happy. The episode, Purdy\u2019s first for the series, was an early landmark of how cannily the show would begin experimenting with form to reflect heightened emotion (in one sequence, BoJack loses the cartoon outlines of his body and melts into the background in a panic). Bob-Waksberg wanted Purdy to envision a series with that wild psychedelia as its starting point, and which would \u201cjust get crazier and crazier from there,\u201d he tells The Daily Beast.\n\nIn planning how Alma\u2019s story would tread the line between banality and fantasy, \u201cRaphael talked about the tension of: is this A Beautiful Mind or is this The Matrix?\u201d recalls Purdy. \u201cIs this someone who has lost their mind and is creating a delusional reality to feel that they have purpose and that the world makes sense, or are they actually tapping into something?\u201d\n\nAlma herself is often skeptical of whether she\u2019s truly transcended reality, though she badly wants to believe she can\u2014both to connect with her dead father, and to escape the dead-end life she once tried to end. The show couches itself in that space: between doubt and belief, rationality and faith. In that way, it\u2019s a mix of both its creators\u2019 philosophies. \u201cI think Alma gets Kate\u2019s eagerness to believe in something, and she gets my trepidation,\u201d says Bob-Waksberg. \u201cI think that tension is a big part of what makes the character work.\u201d\n\nStill, Undone is unmistakably Purdy\u2019s show. Her personal experiences with mental illness and spirituality inform much of the series, and many of its thematic preoccupations parallel her individual work on BoJack. (She penned that show\u2019s gutting, time- and reality-bending \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow\u201d episode, which told the story of a complicated woman\u2019s life before Alzheimer\u2019s.) In Undone, Alma often fixates on the fate of her paternal grandmother, a housewife who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After the accident, her ghost-dad informs her that, like many shamans and spiritual leaders in non-Western countries, schizophrenics typically have enlarged brain ventricles (the cavities which carry cerebral spinal fluid)\u2014just as Alma does.\n\nPurdy\u2019s brain has them, too, as she learned after wrenching the results of a CT scan in college from her reluctant doctor after a bout of viral meningitis. She stared at the gaping dark parts of her brain and thought of her late grandmother, who\u2019d been schizophrenic. \u201cI already had this fear around not knowing what that meant, not knowing if I could develop it, whether it was genetically in me or not, so it increased my fear around losing my mind,\u201d she remembers. She\u2019d once stumbled on a Time magazine article about a study linking enlarged brain ventricles and schizophrenia. It mentioned that women who haven\u2019t developed the disease by age 30 usually don\u2019t. \u201cI started counting down the days \u2019til my 30th birthday,\u201d Purdy recalls. \u201cAnd I was easily triggered whenever anybody said, \u2018You\u2019re so crazy,\u2019 even if it was just off-handedly.\u201d (In the show, Alma snaps at her boyfriend when he jokingly calls her the same.)\n\n\u201c It\u2019s also inherited trauma. What shaped the character of our grandparents, the reality that they existed through and survived through, then shape their children. And in those behaviors, then shape us, whether we have an awareness of it or not. \u201d\n\nBut the anxieties reflected in Undone, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d and another of Purdy\u2019s standout BoJack episodes, \u201cThe Old Sugarcane Place,\u201d concern more than just inherited DNA, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s also inherited trauma. What shaped the character of our grandparents, the reality that they existed through and survived through, then shape their children. And in those behaviors, then shape us, whether we have an awareness of it or not.\u201d\n\nPurdy, a former UCB stand-up who wrote for MADtv and Cougar Town before working her way to BoJack (she\u2019s since moved up to become co-executive producer) recalls experiencing \u201cpretty deep depression and anxiety\u201d in her early-30s. Turning to \u201calternative healing modalities like Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, and also shamanistic traditions from Polynesia and central Mexico and India,\u201d along with meditation and \u201creadings of ancient texts,\u201d she says, helped widen her sense of reality. The show also draws on more science-based ideas, particularly quantum entanglement, in illustrating the limits of what we can perceive.\n\n\u201cSo much of spiritual philosophy right now points to the fact that with theoretical physics, we\u2019re kind of getting to the same point of understanding that these ancient traditions have been talking about for thousands of years,\u201d Purdy explains. \u201cThere is this mystery around quantum entanglement. Like, why is it possible that these two particles that are light-years apart can still have a connection, can still understand each other or move simultaneously in reaction or relation to each other? That there is an invisible something seemingly holding everything together that we don\u2019t know or understand?\u201d\n\nUndone never presumes to have the answers. Instead, it\u2019s content to simply expand Alma\u2019s perspective\u2014of the fabric of space-time, sure, but also of herself and the people in her family. Their shortcomings and good intentions, their patterns and communication breakdowns, and her role in accepting their love. Cosmic provocations and dreamlike surreality aside, the show\u2019s emotional heart stays earthbound. Perhaps surprisingly, the effect of that is heightened, not hampered by the show\u2019s animation style. \u201cThat it\u2019s hand-drawn and hand-painted really gives it an organic feel,\u201d Purdy says.\n\nThe process of rotoscoping Undone involved a number of feats of human imagination. Actors performed in an empty L.A. studio with little more than tape to mark the bare bones of sets and backgrounds that animators would eventually paint. Footage of the performances was then sent to an animation house, Austin\u2019s Minnow Mountain, to be outlined frame-by-frame. Those pages then shipped to Amsterdam, where the artists of the animation production studio Submarine set about inking, oil painting, and animating. \u201cOur composer, Amie Doherty, she right away said, this is a very organic show and I want the score to feel very organic and hand-made as well\u2014you know, real instruments,\u201d adds Purdy. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that you had this cohesion of that feeling.\u201d\n\nApart from its animation style, Undone represents another rarity in television: a series led by a biracial Latina. Alma\u2019s mother is Mexican; their strained relationship bears a handful of telltale signs of first- and second-generation disconnect (as in the way Alma responds in English whenever her mother speaks Spanish). \u201cWe always envisioned her as being Latina,\u201d says Purdy, who spent a chunk of her childhood in Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m not Latina, but I\u2019m from San Antonio. And San Antonio\u2019s about 70 percent Mexican or Latinx and so a lot of our friends were these Mexican-American families. I just felt like there wasn\u2019t enough representation of those kinds of families on television and it felt like a great opportunity to make this world more specific.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd also I think if we\u2019re saying this is set in San Antonio, then it should be a Latinx family because otherwise it\u2019s just not realistic,\u201d laughs Bob-Waksberg. \u201cYou know, we\u2019d be singling out this specific white family in San Antonio when, odds are if you\u2019re going to any given family, it would be a Latinx one.\u201d\n\nAs for Alma\u2019s belief that she is broken\u2014that her life is bad because she is bad, and that this is irreversible\u2014Bob-Waksberg sympathizes, but offers stern, wise words. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily helpful for people to label themselves as a broken individual,\u201d he says, with a full-throated belly laugh that is more Mr. Peanutbutter than BoJack or Alma. \u201cOne of the underlying themes of this show and of BoJack\u2014although in some cases, it\u2019s very underlying\u2014is the idea that nobody is really broken. Nobody is really complete, but also nobody is broken. That we\u2019re all wounded, fragile, difficult, prickly, hard people who are trying to figure things out the best we can.\u201d\n\nHe laughs again. \u201cI would not say when Alma says \u2018broken people break people\u2019 that that is us saying, \u2018Here\u2019s the truth! Here\u2019s Moses coming down from the mountain with this aphorism that we believe!\u2019 You\u2019re supposed to question that and think about that and maybe apply it to yourself, but think about what it means.\u201d", "description": "Amazon\u2019s new animated series \u201cUndone\u201d is \u201cas incisive about mental illness, inherited trauma, disability, and spirituality as it is warm, funny, and daring,\u201d writes Melissa Leon.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon", "Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568541339/unnamed_15_hgbktf", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
