There will be difficult debates and even more difficult decisions,\" said Varadkar, citing a list of issues including tariffs, state aid, visa regimes and aviation landing rights. \"I think it may make the negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement seem simple,\" he added.\n\nIn the scenario of no deal, he said that after a period of living with the consequences, the two sides would need to come back to the negotiating table. But he said the U.K. would not be able to avoid the issues that have dominated the talks for the last two years.\n\n\"The first and only items on the agenda for such negotiations will be citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement with the EU and a solution to the Irish border,\" said Varadkar.\n\n\"Brexit is not a storm to be weathered,\" he concluded. \"It is a permanent change in the political and economic environment in which the European Union and the United Kingdom will exist.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["James Randerson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/irelandB78x67-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
