Over the course of an hour, Cargle \u2014 a 30-year-old undergraduate student in anthropology at Columbia University, who was booked alongside prominent names like DeRay Mckesson, Ijeoma Oluo and Imani Perry \u2014 sped through her material: how the conversation around race is really about power; how the realities of race cannot be intellectualized, despite the fact that we were in an academic setting; how race has been de\ufb01ned and changed over history.\n\n\u201cWho has written the books?\u201d she asked the crowd of 100 or so \u2014 mostly women, but otherwise split evenly between black and white, millennials and middle-aged, tweedy academics and those wearing floral dresses. \u201cWho gets to be part of the canon? Who are knowers, and who gets to be known?\u201d\n\nToward the end, she asked another series of questions, this time just for the white people in the room to consider: Whom do I talk to about race? Whom do I not talk to about race? And why?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk to my dad\u2019s partner, who is very racist,\u201d said one middle-aged white woman. Cargle asked why. \u201cIt would upset my dad,\u201d the woman answered. Another white woman said she worried she would come across as a \u201csuperior, belligerent know-it-all.\u201d A young woman said she doesn\u2019t talk about it to her colleagues at work because she\u2019s worried what they\u2019d think.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Cargle said. \u201cWhite people love to be the victim in the conversation about race. Worried is about your child getting shot in the street. Unless your mom is gonna stab you, I\u2019m pretty sure you should bring it up \u2014 and even then, I bet you have better health insurance than me.\u201d\n\nThen there was a spitfire round of what white people in the room would feel like if they woke up the next morning black: Terrified. Aware. Nervous. Worried. Frustrated. Apprehensive. Careful. Ineffective. Exhausted. Not privileged. Burdened. Confused. Lost. Unsure. Threatened. Angry. Stressed out. A black woman sitting in front of me made quiet, guffawing noises after each word.\n\n\u201cThis is a room of really aware white people,\u201d Cargle said. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you do more?\u201d\n\nRachel Cargle, right, with Dana Suchow at the 2017 Women\u2019s March in Washington. (\u00a9 Kennedy Carroll Photography)\n\nCargle\u2019s activist origin story begins with a photo taken at the 2017 Women\u2019s March in Washington. In the photo, Cargle and her friend Dana Suchow, also an activist, are standing in front of the U.S. Capitol. Both women have raised left fists in the air, reminiscent of the famous photo of Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes. Suchow, who is white, is holding a poster that reads, \u201cProtect: Black, Asian, Muslim, Latinx, Disabled, Trans, Fat, Poor, Women.\u201d Cargle is holding one that reads, \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Fight for All Women You Fight for No Women.\u201d The photo went viral, and Cargle went from being an unknown budding activist to an educator and writer who uses her rapidly expanding social media platform to talk about racial politics.\n\nNow, 2\u00bd years later, she deploys this photo at the start of \u201cUnpacking White Feminism,\u201d her consistently sold-out lecture that covers the racism ignored by the mainstream feminist narrative. Her signature message is one of tough love for do-gooder progressive white women. Cargle\u2019s work is dedicated to intersectionality \u2014 a buzzed-about term that means that inequalities based on class, race, gender and other identities should be seen as intersecting, rather than as separate issues. The idea of intersectionality has become mainstream and oddly fashionable. In March pop star Ariana Grande tweeted, \u201cit ain\u2019t feminism if it ain\u2019t intersectional.\u201d Activist-writer Flavia Dzodan\u2019s 2011 quote \u201cMy feminism will be intersectional or it will be bulls\u2014\u201d is printed on T-shirts. On Etsy, you can buy tattoo-inspired stickers that read \u201cintersectional feminism\u201d inside a heart, or an enamel lapel pin that spells out \u201cintersectional\u201d like a crossword puzzle.\n\nCargle\u2019s Instagram feed is a mix of pithy quotes like \u201cMaybe you manifested it, maybe it\u2019s white privilege\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want your love and light if it doesn\u2019t come with solidarity and action\u201d alongside photos of her dog, Professor Marley, and stacks of books on her bedside table. She has more than 286,000 followers, including comedian Amy Schumer, actor Tessa Thompson, model Karen Elson and every yoga teacher I\u2019ve ever had. Last year in August, she wrote a piece for HarpersBazaar.com titled \u201cWhite Feminism Is White Supremacy in Heels\u201d; it performed so well that she now contributes a monthly column to the site. She\u2019s even ventured into the world of influencers, doing sponsored Instagram posts for the clothing brand Lafayette 148 New York.\n\nWith more than 286,000 followers, Rachel Cargle is using Instagram as a platform for discussions on race and feminism. (Washington Post illustrations based on photos from Instagram and iStock)\n\nWhen she brought \u201cUnpacking White Feminism\u201d to the Wing, the women\u2019s club and co-working space in Georgetown, in May, she asked how many people in the audience follow her on Instagram. Most people raised their hands, applauded or even howled. The conversation around intersectionality, especially when it comes to feminism, has flourished online; Cargle\u2019s account functions as a real-time workshop on racial injustice, much of it playing out in conversations happening in the hundreds of comments on her posts. An example: In August, Cargle posted that, during a conversation about racist words, someone told her to be the bigger person \u2014 essentially, to get over it. Cargle wrote that she refuses \u201cto oblige to the various ways that whiteness demands we simply take what they give.\u201d\n\nInstagram, the hub for Cargle\u2019s teachings, is an image-based platform that makes sense as a home for photos of babies and vacation selfies; it\u2019s seemingly an odd fit for one of our country\u2019s most significant \u2014 and heated \u2014 discussions. America hasn\u2019t figured out a way to have a healthy, productive discussion about race, so how deep can these conversations go on an app that prioritizes responding in a few emoji from your smartphone? Simone Marean, a California-based co-founder of the nonprofit Girls Leadership, started following Cargle in 2018. \u201cI felt like I was microdosing lessons about white privilege and white supremacy on Instagram,\u201d says Marean, who is white. \u201cIt\u2019s digestible, and I stay connected to it every day.\u201d She compares her awareness of her own privilege to a weak muscle that needed to be exercised.\n\nInstagram certainly encourages passionate and seemingly off-the-cuff arguments. And in that sense, Cargle\u2019s account and its community are a kind of fever dream for the right, a place where people take identity politics to the extreme. A white woman whose Instagram handle was mrsdonovanm (bio: \u201cWife, mama, runner\u201d) commented on Cargle\u2019s August post: \u201cThe assumption is made that black folks need to be taught or told when to employ certain feelings, restraint, some kind of filter, emotions, remarks, responses, etc. It\u2019s insidious. We need to be more conscious of our demands that we place upon an entire people. NEED TO BE. I would like to help do away with the soft, gentle encouragement that is friendly to my fellow WASP-woman sensibilities. F\u2014 friendly.\u201d\n\nBut if the online discussions around Cargle can sometimes put the pitfalls of social media on display, they also don\u2019t represent the sum total of her ideas. \u201cI have to remind people all the time that Instagram is a tool of my work. It\u2019s not my work,\u201d Cargle said. \u201cI\u2019m a lecturer, academic, scholar. I use social media to develop communities.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never had anyone cry, but there are body reactions,\u201d Cargle says of her confrontational lectures on white feminism. \u201cYou hear the gasps when I teach something. You see the discomfort in people\u2019s bodies.\n\nCargle grew up in Green, Ohio, outside of Akron. Her father died when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, who has polio. They lived off her disability checks, in Section 8 housing in a wealthy white neighborhood her mother chose for the good schools. She saw her mother speak up about injustice out of necessity. \u201cI played soccer competitively, and the field would always get wet because we would do early morning games. My mom has crutches, and she couldn\u2019t walk with her crutches through the grass,\u201d Cargle told me. \u201cShe demanded that the city build a cement sidewalk from the parking lot to the field so that she could see my games. And they did it.\u201d\n\nShe was often the only black girl, except at a black Baptist church they attended and a university summer camp. She had trouble fitting in there, too. \u201cIt was really hard for me because I didn\u2019t \u2018talk black,\u2019 so I was always made fun of,\u201d she says. \u201cI always \u2018talked white,\u2019 as they would say. I just wasn\u2019t aware of some of the nuances of what urban living looked like. I didn\u2019t know all the songs. I didn\u2019t know all the dances.\u201d But camp was kind of a haven, too, where she didn\u2019t have to be the token black kid.\n\nAfter high school, Cargle enrolled at the University of Toledo, got married and divorced, then moved to Washington, D.C., at 23, where she worked odd jobs. She eventually applied to Columbia University\u2019s School of General Studies, a B.A. program for mature students, and started at 28, after a period of traveling the States and staying in hostels in Asia. \u201cI remember being in Osaka and sitting down and hearing a boy from Korea tell me all the stuff about Malcolm X that he said he learned at school,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018We don\u2019t even learn about Malcolm X in school.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen the photo of Cargle at the Women\u2019s March started making the Internet rounds, it was praised at first. \u201cI thought it was cool,\u201d she told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t think, Wow, my time has come, I\u2019m going to be big \u2014 but something I was part of was starting conversations, and I was part of the collective memory of the Women\u2019s March.\u201d\n\nHowever, when the image was posted on the site Afropunk, which has a largely black readership, the comments were less enthusiastic. \u201cI got a lot of criticism for why I\u2019d be part of this,\u201d she told the audience at the Wing. \u201cI was taken aback and completely questioned what I thought about myself in the feminist movement. And that\u2019s when I realized there were a ton of murky waters \u2014 blatant racism I had to literally trudge through.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point I call the women\u2019s marches \u2018parades,\u2019 with white women doing arts and crafts the night before,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is an event for them. It wasn\u2019t until white women were personally affected that they came out in the millions. All of a sudden they knew how to organize. Women of color have been marching a long time.\u201d\n\nCargle realized that there was a lot about race and feminism she didn\u2019t know. \u201cAnd if I didn\u2019t know it, then there were a whole bunch of white women who also didn\u2019t know what they needed to,\u201d she said. She went through an autodidact phase, reading books and academic journals by black writers she had never heard of (a manifesto from the 1970s Boston-based black lesbian feminist Combahee River Collective was one major influence), watching lectures and interviews, talking to friends. \u201cIt was a lot of me posting as I learned. I gave myself permission not to be an expert,\u201d she says. She decided to give a talk on what she\u2019d learned, and booked a conference room in a co-working space in Harlem with 12 chairs. \u201cTickets were probably 12 dollars, maybe 20. But we sold around 60 and had to move it to a larger space.\u201d\n\nAfter that first talk, Cargle, who was working as a nanny at the time, started to get requests for events at community spaces like Fearless in Winston-Salem, N.C., and the Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio. By June 2018 she was able to quit nannying and focus on the lecture circuit. She charged $3,500 per private talk, or $35 per person for public ones, plus travel, and has lectured at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, Tulane University in New Orleans, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York. She has also done private lectures for corporations and organizations, and has added a three-hour anti-racism intensive workshop called \u201cThe Start\u201d to her offerings. Her income is a combination of writing and speaking fees, donations from people who support her on the site Patreon, and money from consulting work, particularly around projects about art and race, most recently for the public arts organization Creative Time in New York.\n\nHer rapid success has left room for self-doubt. \u201cI have so much impostor syndrome when I go up and lecture,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Am I a good teacher? Am I a good researcher? Am I a good writer?\u2019 I question myself all the time.\u201d\n\nWhen women have come up to me crying, I say, \u2018Let me know when you feel a little better, then maybe we can talk.\u2019 It\u2019s like a man coming up and crying: \u2018Oh, this whole patriarchy thing is so hard.\u2019\n\nCargle usually gives \u201cUnpacking White Feminism\u201d to a room populated largely by white women. That\u2019s by design. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for [black women] to come. They know everything I\u2019m teaching,\u201d she says. She uses an intentionally confrontational tone, including telling the audience what to tweet and how to talk to her after the Q&A: \u201cI need you to think critically,\u201d she said at the Wing in Georgetown. \u201cThese are actual facts, and you need to take [them] as that. If you have feelings about it, take it to your therapist, because this is not the space.\u201d When she told us to take notes and forward them to a friend we didn\u2019t bring \u2014 \u201cnot the people you feel [would be] comfortable with this\u201d \u2014 many of the audience members dutifully took out pens and notebooks.\n\nAt the Wing, Cargle showed a slide of first-wave feminists and suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Carrie Chapman Catt. \u201cLook at them: These are your heroes,\u201d Cargle said in a mocking, babyish voice, while highlighting quotes like \u201cWhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by women\u2019s suffrage,\u201d from Catt, who founded the League of Women Voters \u2014 and whose likeness, along with other women, appears on the custom wallpaper that covers the entryway of the Wing.\n\n\u201cIf the goal of your feminism is to get equal power with white men, you\u2019re going to have to oppress a bunch of people,\u201d Cargle said, then added: \u201cI want you to tweet that.\u201d A few people nervously laughed. (\u201cI\u2019ve never had anyone leave, surprisingly,\u201d she told me later. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anyone just get up and walk away. I\u2019ve never had anyone cry, but there are body reactions. You hear the gasps when I teach something. You see the discomfort in people\u2019s bodies.\u201d)\n\nThe rapid-fire hour of ideas ended with a reminder that the lecture was not meant as entertainment, but as the beginning of much more work for the white people in her audience to do. \u201cAnti-racist work is not self-improvement for white people,\u201d she said. The white women who attend her lectures swear they are attending not because they are masochists overcome with white guilt, but because they\u2019re learning something, and that Cargle is a blunt but effective teacher. \u201cRachel\u2019s approach is, This is for you, listen up,\u201d Marean says. \u201cI feel lucky to be let into this conversation because I imagine these conversations have been happening for hundreds of years behind our backs. She\u2019s telling me the truth.\u201d\n\nAlaina Mauro, a children\u2019s book publisher who started following Cargle soon after the Women\u2019s March photo went viral and who has attended her talks, says, \u201cI\u2019m trying to expand my horizons and not see the world from my own perspective, because it can be so skewed. Part of it was a reaction to the election. I just felt like I never wanted to listen to a white man tell us something ever again. I am a white woman who grew up in New York \u2014 my worldview is exactly what you think it might be \u2014 and I\u2019m always asking how do I learn more.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a growing awareness around anti-racism in the culture at large, with critically lauded books like Ijeoma Oluo\u2019s \u201cSo You Want to Talk About Race\u201d and Ibram X. Kendi\u2019s \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist.\u201d \u201cHistorically, whiteness has remained centered by being unnamed,\u201d says Robin DiAngelo, author of the 2018 bestseller \u201cWhite Fragility: Why It\u2019s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism.\u201d \u201cThis is an interesting time, with the intensity and explicit permission given to express white racism, and the violence that goes with that. The ways white nationalists are recruiting are very open now, in a way that it wasn\u2019t before, but so is the challenge to those things. There is a sense of urgency to the conversation and a receptivity because it is so clear. We are past this post-racial nonsense we had during the Obama years. That\u2019s off the table.\u201d\n\nOne of the most oft-quoted passages of DiAngelo\u2019s book reads, \u201cIt is white people\u2019s responsibility to be less fragile; people of color don\u2019t need to twist themselves into knots trying to navigate us as painlessly as possible.\u201d Cargle and DiAngelo, who is white, have never met; DiAngelo says she isn\u2019t familiar with Cargle\u2019s work. Cargle calls \u201cWhite Fragility\u201d \u201cincredible\u201d but adds, \u201cI have my feelings about a white woman making a profit off racial discussion, specifically one in which she is part of the privileged group. It\u2019s like a man having a book tour about rape culture or something. \u2026 I just hope some of the profits are going to the communities that she claims she\u2019s being a voice for.\u201d (DiAngelo responded: \u201cI can assure her that I am in my integrity in terms of accountability. A percentage of my income goes to racial justice organizations led by people of color. Two-thirds of net income raised from my public workshops go directly to local racial justice organizations led by people of color, so I am not making more than those local organizations I am donating to.\u201d)\n\nDuring the Wing Q&A, someone asked about how Cargle takes care of herself. It\u2019s one of her most frequently asked questions. The modern definition of \u201cself-care\u201d was popularized by the black feminist Audre Lorde, who wrote, \u201cCaring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\u201d Maybe people love asking because the concept is more popular than ever, though it has become commodified and diluted into ways to sell sheet masks and juice cleanses. Or perhaps it\u2019s just a less scary topic to broach than one\u2019s own racism.\n\n\u201cMy biggest form of self-care is being in a space with other black women,\u201d Cargle said. \u201cI have a lot of conversations about what self-care looks like. If a middle-class white woman decides to go to the spa, it\u2019s just \u2018self-care.\u2019 If a poor black woman decides to take a day off work, she\u2019s being irresponsible. Who deserves to care for themselves?\u201d To mark her 30th birthday in November, she started a GoFundMe campaign to benefit women of color seeking therapy; she raised nearly $250,000, named her burgeoning nonprofit the Loveland Foundation, and brought on a consultant to help her grow. More than 460 women have signed up so far.\n\nCargle is always swarmed after lectures, forcing her to set rules. \u201cI refuse to listen to white women cry about something,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhen women have come up to me crying, I say, \u2018Let me know when you feel a little better, then maybe we can talk.\u2019 It\u2019s like a man coming up and crying: \u2018Oh, this whole patriarchy thing is so hard.\u2019 Like, no, we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d\n\nPeople bring her cards and gifts \u2014 \u201cteas and candles,\u201d she says \u2014 and even cash, which she accepts. After one talk, I watched Cargle compliment a pair of statement earrings a white woman in Gucci slippers had on. The woman took them off and pressed them into Cargle\u2019s hands. It was Christine Bronstein, founder of a publishing company called Nothing But the Truth, which focuses on publishing women of color. \u201cShe has inspired me to take a much more holistic understanding of the issues,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a better human and especially open my eyes to where I\u2019m upholding systems that are oppressive.\u201d\n\nCargle likes to observe the way that white women treat black women after her lectures: \u201cA black girl told me that she walked out, and white women parted so she could get through. Like there\u2019s this hyper-awareness of honoring black women based on what they understand about the feminist movement and the racism.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cUnpacking White Feminism,\u201d Cargle talks about an interaction she had online with a white woman, which is saved on her Instagram stories highlights. The white woman wrote to Cargle saying she had one thing she wanted Cargle to hear: \u201cYes, I\u2019m white and privileged but that doesn\u2019t take away from where I\u2019m coming from spiritually,\u201d the woman wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can relate to someone assuming to know something about you.\u201d\n\nCargle wrote her back: \u201cYes I can relate to people assuming things about me, but [the] difference is when people assume things about my black skin it doesn\u2019t just end in me feeling uncomfortable \u2026 I don\u2019t get jobs, I have the chance of getting shot by the police, I don\u2019t get housing loans.\u201d The whole exchange goes on at length: The white woman thinks people should be met where they are, that baby steps are important; Cargle counters that she\u2019s being asked to do emotional labor in educating her on how to be a better ally. The white woman says, \u201cSometimes it feels like your posts are kind of aggressive\u201d and wonders if she can find balance in her tone. Cargle refuses on the grounds that \u201cI have NO interest in coddling my oppressor into listening.\u201d\n\nThis was a common exchange at that point; Cargle used it in her talk to show the kinds of comments she often gets from white women. \u201cI read her comments sometimes, and I just feel like so many of her followers want the result of the work without doing the work,\u201d says her friend Christine Platt, who formerly served as the managing director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I posted a picture of a \u2018Be Anti-racist\u2019 pin we made and on my Instagram people went crazy for it, and I\u2019m like, you just want a pin.\u201d\n\nLayla Saad, another social media activist, who self-published a workbook called \u201cMe and White Supremacy\u201d in the summer of 2018 (it was downloaded by 80,000 people in six months, and Sourcebooks is publishing a version next year), is a supporter of Cargle. \u201cRachel has been doing some important work,\u201d Saad says. \u201cI use my social media platform differently: I tend not to get involved in the debates for the protection of my own energy. But that is a form of education as well, and people really learn from them. More power to Rachel if she can do it and be okay.\u201d\n\nThe crux of Cargle\u2019s work is contained in that exchange with the white woman: that Cargle has no easy answers to impart and that it\u2019s not her job to tell white people how to fix their own racism. This can be a difficult perspective for even the most enlightened white women, who are finally going beyond the now-dated notion of \u201cI don\u2019t see color\u201d or absolving themselves of racism, and realizing that things have been unfair, to say the least, all along in this country. Maybe it activates them, but, Cargle argues, to then turn to a black woman and ask for her advice on what next is the wrong way forward.\n\nAt the \u201cRace 101\u201d lecture at American University, Cargle concluded with a formula for anti-racist work: \u201cHere\u2019s how you can show up,\u201d she said. \u201cKnowledge plus empathy plus action. If you take any one away, you\u2019re performing.\u201d If someone said something racist, it was up to the white audience to get over their own discomfort and tackle the topic themselves. Reticence and recusing yourself is not possible in her world. \u201cRacists should be the most uncomfortable people in your space,\u201d Cargle said. \u201cRacists should be terrified to be around you.\u201d\n\nHer work feels at once electrifying and scary in the importance she places on being uncomfortable and staying uncomfortable. For Cargle, anti-racist work means white people furthering their learning on race, assessing their own interactions, calling out racism where they might not have before \u2014 and teaching other people what Cargle has taught them.\n\nAt her talk at the Antiracist Book Festival, she wore a cashmere sweater from the brand Lingua Franca that had \u201cDecolonize Intellect\u201d embroidered in script across the front. \u201cI refuse to be weathered by the American university system, knowing that I have the same intelligence, the same research ability, the same reading comprehension skills of anyone else,\u201d she told me.\n\nTo that end, in August, Cargle decided to leave Columbia. In April a black male student on his way to a campus center was followed by university police after he declined to show his identification at the main gates of Barnard, an affiliate college. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stomach paying the university money anymore,\u201d Cargle says. She assessed her options, including going to a historically black college or university, but decided to become an independent scholar outside of academia.
