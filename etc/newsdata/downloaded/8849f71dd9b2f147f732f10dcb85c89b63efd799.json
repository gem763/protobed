We can achieve all our dreams or goals. That\u2019s why we want to give our best this week and hopefully do the same in the final.\u201d\n\nKolisi said the team was grateful for the support they had received in Japan, and also from back home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of our people back home and the people who came last week to support us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was a big group that one of our team sponsors brought out to support us and that was huge for us to see.\n\n\u201cAnother of our sponsors has a big screen in the team room with messages coming from South Africa and we really do appreciate the messages of support coming from back home.\n\n\u201cWe know so many people want to be here but can\u2019t make it and we just want to say that we really appreciate it. We are doing this for them - for South Africa. We\u2019re doing it for all the people back at home.\u201d\n\nStanding in their path is a Wales team that briefly held the No. 1 world ranking this year and is aiming for its own piece of history by reaching the final for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re facing a tough opposition but all we can do is focus on what we do best and what got us here,\u201d said Kolisi.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited as a team. We\u2019ve worked hard this week. We have prepped as much as we can and given them the respect they deserve. Bu the most important thing is that we\u2019re effective at what we do - that\u2019s our focus.\u201d\n\nKolisi said the team believed it had been on an upward trajectory since their arrival in Japan.\n\n\u201cWe lost the first game, so we have been under pressure since then,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have been playing knockout rugby from the beginning but being here for so long has helped us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got used to the environment, we\u2019ve adapted quickly and got to know what works for you and what doesn\u2019t work for you while you\u2019re here. And we have been improving as a team.\n\n\u201cI think our team spirit and understanding of one another as a team and knowing what makes each other tick has been really huge for us.\u201d\n\nThe semi-final kicks off at 11:00 SA time and will be broadcast by SuperSport (channel 201) and SABC radio.\n\nTeams:\n\nWales\n\n15 Leigh Halfpenny, 14 George North, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Dan Biggar, 9 Gareth Davies, 8 Ross Moriarty, 7 Justin Tipuric, 6 Aaron Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones, 4 Jake Ball, 3 Tomas Francis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Wyn Jones\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Dillon Lewis, 19 Adam Beard, 20 Aaron Shingler, 21 Tomos Williams, 22 Rhys Patchell, 23 Owen Watkin\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 S'bu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\n\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn", "description": "The Springboks go into their Rugby World Cup semi-final against Wales knowing that this is much more than just two groups chasing an oval ball.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9390/a2d11a7a91bb4b1f807608feffa63c40.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
