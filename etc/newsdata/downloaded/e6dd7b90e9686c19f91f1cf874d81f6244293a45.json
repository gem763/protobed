Explicit details of exactly what this entailed have not been confirmed.\n\n\u201cAfter her repeated violations and attempted interference with royal affairs, His Majesty the King graciously granted her the title of Royal Noble Consort in July out of hope that Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi would lessen her pressure and change her behavior and acts,\u201d an official announcement stated.\n\nHowever, Wongvajirapakdi \u201coverstepped her authority\u201d, according to the notice.\n\n\"Her actions are considered as disloyal, ungrateful, and ungracious of His Majesty\u2019s kindness.\n\n\u201cThey caused division among the royal servants and led to misunderstanding among the public. These amount to acts of sabotages against the country and the monarchy.\u201d\n\nThe king, the statement said, had learned \u201cshe neither was grateful to the title bestowed upon her, nor did she behave appropriately according to her status\u201d.\n\nWhat will happen to Wongvajirapakdi?\n\nWongvajirapakdi\u2019s ongoing relationship with the Thai Royal Family is unknown and how much we learn of her future is entirely dependent on what the Thai Royal Household chooses to share with the public. The country\u2019s lese-majeste law prohibits any criticism of the monarchy, with offenders subject to a substantial prison sentence, contributing to a culture of uncertainty.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn denounced both his second and third wives, but neither have ever issued a statement about this.\n\nAndrew MacGregor Marshall, author of \"A Kingdom in Crisis: Thailand's Struggle for Democracy in the 21st Century\", told The Independent: \"By appointing an official consort and acknowledging royal polygamy for the first time in a century, Vajiralongkorn was sending a political signal - he intends to reign as an absolute monarch like the Thai kings of the past.\n\n\"By suddenly stripping his consort of her status just three months later, he is also signalling his power,\" he said.\n\n\"He wants Thais to recognise that he has the power to elevate people and crush people based on his whims, and nobody can stand in his way.\"", "description": "The recent news that the Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn has stripped his royal consort of her titles and military ranks just months after bestowing them upon her has sent\u00a0ripples throughout the Southeast Asian country.", "authors": ["Joanna Whitehead"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/15/Thailand-consort.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
