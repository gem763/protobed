Biden touted a longstanding strength among \u201cethnic communities\u201d at a Thursday fundraiser in Palo Alto, California.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll kidding aside, I\u2019ve always been able to do very, very well in ethnic communities,\u201d Mr. Biden said, according to a pool report of the event. \u201cAnd I say something outrageous, but it\u2019s true, where I come from, the most loyal constituency I\u2019ve had is the African-American community, I still take a look at the numbers, by far and away, that is the base of my support and loyalty and it has stayed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThough Sen. Elizabeth Warren has caught or even passed Mr. Biden in some recent polls in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, the former vice president has indeed retained strong support among African-Americans, a key Democratic constituency in states like South Carolina, home to the first-in-the-south primary.\n\n\n\nAt the event on Thursday, Mr. Biden also pushed back against a \u201csocialist\u201d vision of the country. That could be seen as a knock on Sen. Bernard Sanders, a top rival for the Democratic presidential nomination who raised more money than Mr. Biden did in the third quarter.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to share in the benefits. That\u2019s been broken. You don\u2019t need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this - you\u2019ve just got to make capitalism work like it\u2019s supposed to work,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\n\n\nHe also said he can\u2019t make the same mistakes Hillary Clinton did in 2016 and get dragged into a mud fight with President Trump.\n\n\n\n\u201cI did 83 events for Hillary, I campaigned like the devil for her,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cBut what happened was, and she talks about it, you got sucked into the trap of the stuff that Trump was laying. He wants you in a mud fight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut when you respond to that, it brings you back down into that and that got us into the whole thing, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I feel confident, based on not just the polling, but all the campaigns I\u2019ve run.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
