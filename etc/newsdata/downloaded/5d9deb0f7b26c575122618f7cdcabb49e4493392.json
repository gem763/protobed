Her backstory is full of sex and science, money and magical illusions. And today she is the world\u2019s most wanted woman\u2014at least by the media and Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims.\n\nShe is the youngest child of the notorious and disgraced British media mogul Robert Maxwell, rumored after his mysterious death in 1991 to have been an Israeli spy. She was the alleged paramour-turned-pimp for Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire pedophile who reportedly committed suicide in his cell on August 10.\n\nBut there are no known criminal charges against her, only allegations in a civil suit. Indeed, there is speculation she may be cooperating with federal prosecutors. And while she might have decided to hide out here in Provence at her sister\u2019s house in the shadow of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s favorite mountain, she was spotted Thursday in California eating a burger while reading a book about CIA heroes.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, in short, is a survivor.\n\n\u201cIn moments of greatest adversity, that\u2019s where they\u2019re the coolest; it\u2019s bred into the family,\u201d an executive with one of Robert Maxwell\u2019s media companies said after his drowning upended his media empire and forced his wife and children to clean up the mess. \u201cMaxwell\u2019s whole life was \u2018Never panic.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs we looked for her in France in recent days, she was, of course, nowhere to be seen. But we did discover enough skeletons in the family closet (including those of her in-laws and their families) to fill a house of horrors.\n\nWe searched near her dead mother\u2019s estate east of here\u2014and even at the bottom of a cliff in Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, a few hours from Meyreuil, where her brother-in-law Al Seckel, giver of TED talks on optical illusions, reportedly fell to his death in 2015 after he was exposed as a swindler in Los Angeles.\n\nWe also looked at the family tree of her other brother-in-law, an American astrophysicist whose genius rocket scientist father Frank Malina at the Jet Propulsion Lab in California pioneered what would become NASA before he fled to France with J. Edgar Hoover's G-Men on his heels.\n\nFor Ghislaine, presumably, outer space is not an option. But in point of fact, she does know how to operate a lot of exotic machinery. In addition to speaking four languages and holding a degree from Oxford, she\u2019s a trained private helicopter pilot, a submersible pilot and qualified to operate undersea robots. Much was made of the latter qualifications when she was fund-raising for her now defunct TerraMar oceanic environmental project, which shuttered after Epstein\u2019s arrest last month.\n\nGhislaine, who wanted to be seen as a visionary, liked to hang out with others who cultivate that rep, and was pictured with Elon Musk, whose Space X program is based in Hawthorne, just south of Los Angeles.\n\nAh, there\u2019s a California connection again.\n\nBut France is still where Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s family history begins. Both she and her mother, the elegant and long-suffering Elisabeth Maxwell, were born here. And while some French officials have called for an investigation into Epstein\u2019s activities in Paris, where he had an opulent apartment, Ghislaine\u2019s French connection goes back decades in the south.\n\nIt also grew out of the horrors of Auschwitz, which wiped out Robert Maxwell\u2019s parents and siblings and eventually inspired his French Protestant wife, Elisabeth, to become a renowned Holocaust scholar.\n\nAnd it includes Ghislaine\u2019s very interesting American in-laws who moved back and forth between Provence, the Dordogne and the United States. Their roots involved the pioneering, often reckless rocket scientists of the 1930s who were called the \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d for their risky work at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Among their circle: L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology fame; the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman; and Briton Aleister Crowley, known for black magic and a sex cult.\n\nMaxwell family observers don\u2019t find it strange that Ghislaine and some of her sisters were drawn to larger-than-life, certifiably strange men.\n\n\u201cThey attach themselves to bizarre psychopaths like their father,\u201d says a researcher who delved into the family years ago. \u201cGhislaine wasn\u2019t the only sister to hook up with a weird guy.\u201d\n\nThe Father\n\nThe daddy issues\u2014and the mysterious death issues\u2014began with Robert Maxwell, born into poverty as J\u00e1n Ludv\u00edk Hyman Binyamin Hoch in Czechoslovakia in 1923. He wanted a big family to recreate, in a way, the siblings he lost to the Nazis, and he very much wanted riches and fame. He achieved all of it, including a seat in the British Parliament. But two of his children died young and greed overtook his ambition.\n\nWhen Robert Maxwell mysteriously disappeared from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, and his naked body was retrieved floating in the waters off the Canary Islands in November 1991, he already had been drowning in debt.\n\nHis business empire was on the verge of ruin and he\u2019d stolen, Bernie Madoff-style, more than $400 million from his employees\u2019 pension funds to forestall bankruptcy. The Pulitzer-Prize-winning reporter Seymour Hersh had recently accused him of being a longtime Israeli intelligence agent in a book about Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal, The Samson Option.\n\nThe conspiracy theories surrounding Robert Maxwell\u2019s death rivaled those of Epstein\u2019s today, although the official take was that he fell off his boat during an early morning walk around the deck.\n\nEpstein, whose pal, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak often crashed at his $77 million Upper East Side apartment in New York, also has been accused of unsavory connections to Israel.\n\n\u201cWhat are the driving forces that make people do things?\u2019 Ghislaine\u2019s mother Elisabeth asked about her husband in 1995 during a New York Times interview to promote her unusually candid autobiography, A Mind of My Own. In it she admitted Maxwell was a philanderer and often treated her badly\u2014but she said she loved him.\n\n\u201cI hope one day there will be a balance. That time passes, passions fall and eventually some truths emerge,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really a Greek tragedy that his path should have finished the way it did.\u201d\n\nThe Kids\n\nTwo of Maxwell\u2019s sons, Kevin and Ian, were investigated for fraud involving their father\u2019s empire after his death and both were cleared in 1996, although at one point Kevin was banned from running a company in the U.K. for eight years. Both landed back in court in 2015 and 2016 facing bankruptcy issues involving another U.K. financial company to which they owed money.\n\nMaxwell biographer Tom Bower was sympathetic to the Maxwell kids, calling their problems, \u201cthe tragic legacy of a crooked father. His children just inherited an awful pack of cards.\u201d\n\nIan Maxwell, now 63, broke his silence about his father in an interview last year with the Sunday Times of London.\n\n\u201cThe embrace was suffocating and so loving and everything came your way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then if you were far away in disgrace or you had blotted your copybook, no matter what you had done you were cast out.\u201d\n\nThe Oxford-educated Ghislaine, who used to be referred to reflexively as a \u201cBritish socialite,\u201d reportedly was her father\u2019s favorite. But two of her sisters, the twins Isabel and Christine, now 69, are the most accomplished of the family. They are internet content pioneers who started Magellan, one of the first search engines, and were featured in Michael Wolff\u2019s book, Burn Rate, about his foray into early startups.\n\nThe sisters (Christine was said to be the brains behind the operation) made millions when Magellan was later sold to the Excite search company.\n\nCuriously, Isabel followed in the family tradition of filing for bankruptcy in December 2015 despite having been a multi-millionaire. That move may have been related to the untimely demise at age 56 of her third husband, the infamous con man Al Seckel who, she later found out, was not legally her husband since he was still married to his first wife. In 2015, when he reportedly died, he was potentially on the hook for millions.\n\nThe Illusionist\n\nSeckel was the subject of an extraordinary 5,000-word investigation earlier that same year by The Tablet\u2019s Mark Oppenheimer that laid bare decades of a convoluted and litigious life as the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest collector of optical illusions.\u201d\n\nSeckel, the son of a refugee from the Nazis, moved to L.A. and used his wile and charm to pass himself off as an Ivy League graduate and double doctoral candidate at Caltech.\n\nSoon, Seckel zeroed in on the movers and shakers. \u201cAn age before Silicon Valley had captured the geek imagination,\u201d Oppenheimer wrote, \u201cCaltech and the surrounding aerospace industry was the frontier of nerd power and glory.\u201d\n\nSeckel befriended and bewitched the Nobel Prize-winning physicists Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann among other neuroscientists, as well as academics and even magicians like James Randi.\n\nSeckel then used those contacts to sell rare books to prestigious customers who were often hoodwinked out of thousands in bad deals. He moved on to co-opt the burgeoning field of optical illusion, popularizing the art of manipulating images by using research from others in books he wrote.\n\n(His daughter, Elizabeth Seckel, has built on her father\u2019s work in optical illusion by pioneering something called \u201cmirror box therapy.\u201d Seckel brought her method, sponsored by the Clinton Global Initiative, to Haiti after the earthquake in 2012 to help recent amputees with their phantom limb pain.)\n\nIn 2010, Seckel hosted a scientific conference on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s infamous private island with Gell-Mann, Leonard Mlodinow, who was Stephen Hawking\u2019s co-author, and MIT\u2019s Gerald Sussman.\n\nOppenheimer told The Daily Beast this week that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Seckel or any of the scientists at the island party were involved in any sexual activity with young girls.\n\nIn 2004 Seckel gave a TED talk that\u2019s been viewed almost 2.5 million times about \u201cperceptual illusions that fool our brains.\u201d\n\nBecause of Seckel\u2019s shady past, it was not surprising that vague reports of his death\u2014a perceptual illusion perhaps?\u2014began popping up just weeks after Oppenheimer\u2019s July 2015 story exposed him to hordes of creditors.\n\nA paid obituary was published on Legacy.com, supposedly after appearing in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, but it does not appear on the paper's website. One report has circulated around various Seckel-obsessed corners of the internet that his body was found at the bottom of a cliff near the home in France where he had moved with Isabel.\n\nBut The Daily Beast could not locate any officials in the town where Seckel was last known to live who had any report of his death. Oppenheimer and others said they have not yet found proof, either. The Daily Beast was unable to reach Isabel Maxwell or Elizabeth Secker for comment.\n\nRocket Men\n\nChristine Maxwell and her astrophysicist husband Roger Malina have, until recently at least, divided their time between their home here in Meyreuil and Dallas, Texas. Malina teaches at the University of Texas there and Christine is a doctoral candidate in the humanities department, a UT spokeswoman told The Daily Beast. Malina was also a director at an astrophysics center in Marseille until last year.\n\nRoger Malina is the son of Czechoslovak-born Frank Malina, an early Elon Musk type who was part of the ragtag group whose daring rocket experiments in 1930s Pasadena led to the formation of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in L.A., the precursor to NASA.\n\nFrank Malina\u2019s best friend, Jack Parsons, was the most charismatic of the group. He led a double life with non-scientist friends like L. Ron Hubbard and Robert Heinlein, author of Stranger in a Strange Land, Starship Troopers, and other sci-fi classics. Parsons also joined an occult group involving the dark arts and sex fetishes founded by Aleister Crowley, an English occultist and magician. The book and CBS TV series Strange Angel are based on Parsons\u2019 life.\n\nIn an odd echo of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s reported desire to seed the human race with his own DNA, Parsons and Hubbard tried for a time to impregnate women to bring forth Babalon, a goddess described as the \u201cScarlet Woman\u201d in the Themelic belief system to which Crowley subscribed.\n\nWhen Parsons died in a mysterious explosion at his home at age 37, he had stopped working for JPL and was for a time a consultant to Israel\u2019s nascent rocket system. Media accounts at the time hinted at \u201csexual perversion,\u201d \u201cblack robes,\u201d \u201csacred fire\u201d and \u201cintellectual necromancy,\u201d according to Vice\u2014and there were also whispers that he might have been murdered.\n\nFrank Malina, Christine Maxwell Malina\u2019s father-in-law, was more of a straight arrow than Parsons and fared better, at first. But some historians say he was cheated of his rightful place as a true hero of the early space race because of years of harassment by the FBI who labeled him a socialist during the McCarthy years because he had campaigned against racial segregation, and raised money for republicans in the Spanish Civil War. After World War II he fled to Paris, where he became a painter and watched the space program soar from afar.\n\nIn a brutal twist, Wernher von Braun, a Nazi rocket scientist who was brought to the U.S. as part of Operation Paperclip, the government program that brought Nazi scientists to build American rockets, became the face of the early space program that some feel Malina deserved to have been.\n\nRoger Malina blogs about his famous father on his website where he wrote last year: \u201cYes, Elon Musk, they triggered in the USA the work that led to your \u2018strange\u2019 vision\u2014and they did it a stone\u2019s throw from where your company SpaceX is currently headquartered. And you are dreaming the same dreams as the \u2018suicide squad,\u2019 as they were called, at Caltech in the 1930s.\u201d\n\nLooking back, that does seem a strange sobriquet, and oddly appropriate, if not for the rocket builders of 80 years ago, then for the Maxwells and those who were close to them.", "description": "The late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s longtime companion and alleged procurer comes from a clan with a penchant for sex, intrigue, science, and illusions.", "authors": ["Dana Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1566088381/190815-Kennedy-Maxwell-hero_oafvph", "published_at": "2019-08-18"}
