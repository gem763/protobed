Passivhaus is a voluntary standard for energy efficient buildings, based on power consumption and air leakage. It was developed in the late eighties and early nineties by German and Sweden scientists Wolfgang Feist and Bo Adamson. Techniques used to meet the standard including orienting compact layouts, to reduce surface area through which heat could be lost, the use of super-insulation and low energy electrical appliances and lighting.\n\nAccording to developer Ssassy Property, the eco-friendly homes are around 30 years ahead of the Government\u2019s 2050 zero-carbon target.\n\nThe company claims they are the first in the country to produce no polluting carbon dioxide at all.\n\nBuyers can choose to customise their house's layouts, kitchens and bathrooms beyond the standard template.\n\nEach home will be constructed from natural, sustainable materials and will come with an electric vehicle charging point.\n\nTwenty-five of the eco-friendly homes are being constructed near the village of Southmoor, Oxfordshire, in a 7.7 acre development dubbed 'Springfield Meadows'.\n\nOf the planned properties, eight custom-built plots have already been purchased \u2014 with the ones remaining on the market retailing for more than \u00a31 million.\n\n'We think this is the first development of zero-carbon, net zero-energy houses in the country,' said Ian Pritchett, director of Ssassy Property and Greencore Construction.\n\n'Our houses are all electric and generate electricity from photovoltaic panels, which can be stored in a battery or used as it is generated.'\n\n'We combine this with mechanical ventilation with heat recovery and mini heat pumps to generate the heating and hot water.'\n\nThe homes being built need virtually no heating or cooling as they are built to the 'Passivhaus' model \u2014 a voluntary, German-derived standard for energy efficiency.\n\nPhotovoltaic solar panels are placed on the roof to generate energy.\n\nThe eco-friendly homes are being powered solely by electricity generated from roof-fitted solar panels, with batteries to store surplus power for later use\n\nAccording to developer Ssassy Property, the eco-friendly homes are around 30 years ahead of the Government\u2019s 2050 zero-carbon target\n\nThe properties will also have mechanical ventilation and mini heat pumps to run their heating and produce hot water. The timber-clad homes will need virtually no heating or cooling, thanks to their energy-efficient design which follows the so-called 'Passivhaus' standard\n\n'Unfortunately, the Government relaxed the proposed 2016 zero-carbon targets after being lobbied by housebuilders,' added Mr Pritchett.\n\n'At present, the main housebuilding corporations control the land and only build at the rate they are sure will sell, maintaining the UK\u2019s housing shortage so that the normal rules of \u201csupply and demand\u201d don\u2019t apply.'\n\n'When there is a shortage of housing, buyers have to purchase what is available rather than what they might want.'\n\nTwenty-five of the eco-friendly homes are being constructed near the village of Southmoor, Oxfordshire, in a 7.7 acre development dubbed 'Springfield Meadows'\n\nBuyers can choose to customise their house's layouts, kitchens and bathrooms beyond the standard template\n\nOf the planned properties, eight custom-built plots have already been purchased \u2014 with the ones remaining on the market retailing for more than \u00a31 million\n\nAccording to Mr Pritchett, current planning legislation and building regulations do not favour the construction of zero-carbon houses.\n\n'In any sensible society, we would expect the planning system to actively encourage zero-carbon houses and be tough on anyone failing to deliver the necessary standard,' he added.\n\n'Instead, we have a planning system that focuses other issues such as numbers of bedrooms, garden sizes, and parking places.'\n\n'These are important issues, but they pale into insignificance compared to the catastrophic implications of climate change.'\n\n'The planning process could be the answer to the problem if only someone had the sense to make real sustainability part of the process.'\n\n'We think this is the first development of zero-carbon, net zero-energy houses in the country,' said Ian Pritchett, director of Ssassy Property and Greencore Construction", "description": "According to developer\u00a0Ssassy Property, the eco-friendly homes in Oxfordshire will be around 30 years ahead of the Government's 2050 zero-carbon target.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19987756-0-image-a-26_1571656544032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
