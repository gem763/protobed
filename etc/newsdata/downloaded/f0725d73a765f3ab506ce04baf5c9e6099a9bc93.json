(AP) - Deshawn McClease\u2019s 3-yard run with 1:03 remaining capped a wild back-and-forth final few minutes and gave Virginia Tech a 42-35 win over Miami on Saturday, in a game where the Hokies wasted a 28-point lead.\n\nDalton Keene caught three touchdown passes for the Hokies (3-2, 1-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), who went up 28-0 in the first half and led 35-14 midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nThat\u2019s before Miami scored three touchdowns in less than four minutes to tie the game - oddly going for a two-point conversion after the second of those scores, then having kicker Bubba Baxa miss an extra point after Deejay Dallas\u2019 62-yard run with 3:16 left tied the game.\n\nBut the Hokies needed only five plays to go 63 yards to take the lead. McClease\u2019s 3-yard run capped the drive, with Keene\u2019s 26-yard catch on third down putting the Hokies on the doorstep.\n\nMiami\u2019s final drive got to the Virginia Tech 10 with 5 seconds left, but N\u2019Kosi Perry - who was brilliant in relief for the Hurricanes, throwing for a career-best 422 yards and a career-high-tying four touchdowns - had his final two throws to the end zone get knocked away.\n\nThe Hurricanes lost despite outgaining the Hokies 563-337. Jeff Thomas had two touchdown catches and 124 receiving yards for Miami, and Brevin Jordan had a TD grab to go along with 136 receiving yards.\n\nIt was a wild end to a wild game, one where Virginia Tech forced five turnovers - including one on each of Miami\u2019s first four possessions - and got a strong first career start from quarterback Hendon Hooker. He was 10 of 20 passing for 184 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Hokies were two-touchdown underdogs, had lost six of their last seven ACC games and were coming off a 45-10 home loss to Duke.\n\nNo matter. They dominated the turnover battle, posted a season-high seven sacks, had the 28-0 lead before Miami\u2019s Mark Pope caught a deflected pass in the end zone on the final play of the half - and then found a way to win after Miami\u2019s huge rally.\n\nPerry relieved starter Jarren Williams and completed 28 of 47 passes. Williams didn\u2019t have any of his seven passes hit the ground - problem was, only four were caught by Hurricanes, the other three by Hokies for interceptions, and he failed to make it out of the first quarter.\n\nThe Hurricanes are still off to their worst five-game start since also going 2-3 in 2011, Al Golden\u2019s first season at Miami.\n\nNew Miami coach Manny Diaz now has the same record in his first season at the Hurricanes\u2019 helm, and even got booed by the home fans when his face appeared on the giant video screens around the stadium in the second quarter.\n\nMiami was bidding for what would have tied the largest comeback win in school history. The Hurricanes were down 28-0 before topping Boston College in 1999.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVirginia Tech: The Hokies hadn\u2019t been 0-3 in conference play since 1951, back when they were members of the Southern Conference - and avoided falling into that hole. The win also gives a huge boost to the Hokies\u2019 bowl hopes; they have been to a bowl in 26 straight seasons, the nation\u2019s longest such streak, and will need to merely go 3-3 in their final six games (next week against Rhode Island is meaningless for bowl purposes) to extend that run. That\u2019s no guarantee, but it obviously is not as daunting as needing to go 4-2 would have been.\n\nMiami: The Hurricanes had turnovers on four consecutive possessions for the first time since the 2010 Sun Bowl against Notre Dame. Williams hadn\u2019t thrown an interception on any of his first 120 Miami passes (117 this season) before getting picked off on Miami\u2019s first drive, setting the tone for a disastrous start. And the last time Miami had more than five turnovers in a game was 2010 - when it had six, against Bud Foster\u2019s defense at Virginia Tech. Saturday was the last time Foster, who is retiring as the Hokies\u2019 defensive coordinator, will coach against Miami.\n\nNO CHAIN\n\nSaturday was the first time since Miami\u2019s \u201cTurnover Chain\u201d debuted in 2017 that the Hurricanes did not force a turnover in a home game.\n\nDEFENSE TRAVELS\n\nThis was the seventh time since 2004 that Virginia Tech forced at least five turnovers. All seven of those games have been road contests for the Hokies - and each of the last three instances have come in the state of Florida (2010 at Miami, 2018 at Florida State).\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVirginia Tech: Host Rhode Island on Oct. 12.\n\nMiami: Host Virginia on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Deshawn McClease's 3-yard run with 1:03 remaining capped a wild back-and-forth final few minutes and gave Virginia Tech a 42-35 win over Miami on Saturday, in a game where the Hokies wasted a 28-point lead.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/virginia_tech_miami_football_99412_c0-115-2752-1719_s1770x1032.jpg?b73c6d45d7351c3647e0d1a2b1340d929bd41805", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
