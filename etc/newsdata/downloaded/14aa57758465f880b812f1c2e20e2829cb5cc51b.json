Tulsi Gabbard on Thursday threatened to boycott the Democratic presidential debate next week to protest what she called the Democratic National Committee\u2019s attempt to rig the primary election.\n\nMs. Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat and presidential hopeful, said the DNC and corporate media were scheming to \u201cusurp\u201d the voters\u2019 role in picking the nominee, similar to the rigging of the 2016 primary to thwart the candidacy of Sen. Bernard Sanders.\n\n\u201cIn this 2020 election, the DNC and corporate media are rigging the election again, but this time against the American people in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said in a video posted on her website.\n\n\u201cThey are attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states, using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic, and holding so-called debates which are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, not inform or enlighten,\u201d she said. \u201cIn short, the DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process.\u201d\n\nMs. Gabbard is among 12 candidates who qualified for the debate Tuesday in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nHer campaign has struggled in the low single digits in the polls. After failing to qualify for the September debate in Houston, Ms. Gabbard was one of the last candidates to meet the DNC\u2019s tougher requirements to get into the Ohio debate.\n\nShe was \u201cseriously considering\u201d boycotting the event.\n\nThe DNC has made a strenuous effort to make the debate and primary process transparent after the 2016 debacle in which it party officials plotted to boost Hillary Clinton by derailing Mr. Sanders\u2018 campaign.\n\nThe DNC did not immediately respond to Ms. Gabbard\u2019s claims.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
