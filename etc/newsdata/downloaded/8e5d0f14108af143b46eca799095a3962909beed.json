Nobody needed much data, or much scouting for that matter, to see that signing Max Scherzer or trading for Justin Verlander was a really good idea. And this much is also true: Analytics vs. scouting is not an either/or proposition for either team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sneaky analytical,\u201d \u00adNationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said Monday on the eve of Game 1. \u201cAnd they\u2019re sneaky scouting. We have an eight-person analytics department \u2014 that we don\u2019t talk about very much. And they know what they\u2019re doing with scouting. I know \u2014 because we\u2019ve tried to make trades with them, and they know our personnel up and down.\u201d\n\nJeff Luhnow, Rizzo\u2019s Houston counterpart, used the same adjective \u2014 \u201csneaky\u201d \u2014 and voiced the same high regard for the Nationals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sort of sneaky in what they do,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk about it a whole lot, but they have good capabilities. We watch their moves. They\u2019re a smart organization, and they\u2019ve got a lot of good people over there. And so do we. We\u2019re sneaky the other way. People label us an analytical organization, but we\u2019ve got really good evaluators, and they use their eyes and their guts. We\u2019re more similar than people think.\u201d\n\nBut the fact remains, on any objective list of baseball\u2019s most analytically oriented organization to its least, the Astros and Nationals might just rank first and 30th, respectively. The fascinating part is how those diverging paths have intersected on the sport\u2019s biggest stage, suggesting there is still room for both philosophies in the sport and that in the end it is simply the team that performs best that will win.\n\n\u201cThe application of game-planning and [the process of] knowing where you\u2019re going to exploit hitters or where your best weapons are \u2014 there\u2019s great knowledge that\u2019s been deployed to these players, more so than ever,\u201d Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201c[But] once you get out on the field, we want our guys to compete. They\u2019re not analysts out there on the mound.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt one time, the Astros \u2014 who hired Luhnow, a former consultant for McKinsey & Co. who has an MBA from the Kellogg School at Northwestern, in December 2011 \u2014 were far and away the most data-driven organization in the game, their methods scrutinized and criticized across the industry.\n\nBut thanks largely to their success on the field \u2014 a playoff appearance in 2015, a World Series title in 2017, a third consecutive 100-win season in 2019 \u2014 the Astros\u2019 gap over the rest of the industry has been reduced in recent years, through the rapid spread of the analytics movement across the game\u2019s front offices, the majority of which are now run by executives with Ivy League degrees and backgrounds in finance and business administration.\n\nThat has left the Nationals as the outlier in a sport that has moved away from traditional scouting. The Astros are one of many teams to have fired the vast majority of their scouts \u2014 including eight as recently as 2017 \u2014 and replaced them largely with data- and video-based analysts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, Luhnow called the culling of scouts a \u201creconfiguring,\u201d telling MLB.com the \u201coverall number of people in the scouting department [will] be roughly the same, if not increased.\u201d Other teams have followed the Astros\u2019 model in cutting loose their traditional scouts and replacing them with nontraditional ones, including most recently the Baltimore Orioles, whose GM, Mike Elias, is a former Luhnow lieutenant with the Astros.\n\nRizzo, a longtime scout who rose through the front-office ranks largely on the basis of his astute talent evaluation, insisted he has no more animosity toward the Astros than he did for the teams the Nationals have already beaten this month \u2014 the Milwaukee Brewers, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cardinals \u2014 just because they have turned away from traditional scouting. But it is also true that others in the scouting fraternity, including some of Rizzo\u2019s guys, would love nothing more than to take down the Astros and, in their minds, win one for the scouts.\n\nAnd at the very least, the \u00adNationals believe their tried-and-true method still works.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re more old-school than [the Astros] are, but I\u2019m saying we trust our guys\u2019 eyes that have seen millions and millions of pitches and at-bats and defensive positionings and outfield arms,\u201d Nationals pitching coach Paul Menhart said. \u201cSo we trust these [scouts] and what they tell us. We still have video and data. We use them both. We\u2019re not exclusive with either. And when you have the talent we have on our pitching staff, giving them the right information and not having them overthink it is key.\u201d\n\nDuring the ALCS, the Nationals had two special assistants, Bob Boone and Ron Rizzi, assigned to the Yankees, and two others, Dan Jennings and Bob Schaefer, assigned to the Astros, with advance scout Jim Cuthbert \u2014 whose job all season was to scout the teams the Nationals would play next and file reports in advance of that series \u2014 doing his regular work on both teams. Two more video-based advance scouts, who travel with the Nationals, worked behind the scenes. Cuthbert eventually peeled off from the ALCS to meet individually with An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin before their starts against the Cardinals. Then he was back in Houston to see the Astros advance against the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Astros, by contrast, do almost all of their advance scouting through data and video and, according to a team official, did not employ a traditional, on-site advance scout during the regular season or postseason.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care where [the information] comes from,\u201d said Nationals reliever Daniel Hudson, who has pitched for teams that are heavily oriented toward analytics and teams that are not. \u201cIf you can tell me what I should do in a certain situation with a certain pitch against a certain hitter, yeah, obviously I\u2019m going to take all that info and interpret it my own way. And I\u2019m also going to feel my way through a game, not just based on numbers \u2014 because if I get beat in a spot where you told me to throw a certain pitch, I\u2019m going to be pissed off.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 belief in traditional scouting was reaffirmed during the NLCS, after their advance scouts believed they detected patterns in the actions of the Cardinals\u2019 hitters during the division series that made them susceptible to certain pitches in certain situations \u2014 information the Nationals\u2019 pitching staff used to limit the Cardinals to six runs, a .130 batting average and a .374 on-base-plus-slugging percentage during a four-game sweep.\n\nOn Monday, as the Nationals went through a workout at Minute Maid Park, Jennings and Schaefer, who had scouted the Astros in person for much of the past 10 days, were preparing the reports they would present to the coaching staff later that night and the coaches would then disseminate to the players.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the other clubhouse, the Astros were doing versions of the same thing, but through different methods and different means. And the only arbiter that will matter, between who was right and who was wrong, would be the scoreboard.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "The AL champs eschew traditional scouts for data and video analysts.
