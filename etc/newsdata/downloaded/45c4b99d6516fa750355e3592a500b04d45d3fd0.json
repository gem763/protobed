Matt Gaetz Kicked Out of Impeachment Inquiry Hearing", "language": "en", "text": "The Democrat chairman of the House intelligence panel pursuing the impeachment probe booted Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) out of a private interview Monday with the top former U.S. National Security Council expert on Russia, Fiona Hill.\n\nIrked by the move, Gaetz, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m on [the House panel on] agriculture,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cWhat are the Democrats so afraid of?\u201d\n\nThe Florida Republican added:\n\nI appeared just to participate, just to observe as a member of Congress, as a member of the Judiciary Committee\u2026 Why is [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff [D-CA] trying to run a kangaroo court? Why is he continuing to limit access to evidence, limit access even from members of Congress?\n\nRep. @mattgaetz: \"I appeared just to participate, just to observe as a member of Congress, as a member of the Judiciary Committee\u2026 Why is Adam Schiff trying to run a kangaroo court?

The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees are conducting the impeachment inquiry into Trump. A frustrated Gaetz aired his disappointment to reporters after being told he was not allowed to sit in on the hearing, venting his anger over what he says are \u201cselective leaks\u201d by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and questioning why he was not allowed to be present during Hill\u2019s testimony. Gaetz added that the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., was involved in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nGaetz also expressed his frustration over being kicked out of Hill\u2019s testimony via Twitter, saying:\n\nChairman Schiff and the radical democrats are now active participants in the coup. To exclude Members of Congress from hearings confirms the American people\u2019s suspicions: this is not a legitimate \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d \u2014 it is a charade.\n\nHe added in a different tweet:\n\nChairman Schiff and Speaker Pelosi are equally complicit in hiding and obfuscating the truth. Blocking Members of Congress from attending \u201cimpeachment\u201d hearings is not only unfair, it runs counter to our Democracy.\n\nChairman Schiff and Speaker Pelosi are equally complicit in hiding and obfuscating the truth.

Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 14, 2019\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, also expressed outrage at Gaetz being kicked out of Hill\u2019s interview.\n\nJordan tweeted:\n\n[Schiff] is conducting his secretive impeachment proceedings in the basement of the Capitol, and now he\u2019s kicked [Gaetz] out of today\u2019s deposition. This testimony should be available to every member of Congress and every single American. What is Schiff hiding?\n\n.@RepAdamSchiff is conducting his secretive impeachment proceedings in the basement of the Capitol, and now he\u2019s kicked @mattgaetz out of today\u2019s deposition. This testimony should be available to every member of Congress and every single American. What is Schiff hiding? \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 14, 2019\n\nRepublican congressmen who have witnessed the testimony provided by the impeachment inquiry witnesses interviewed so far have lambasted the House Democrats for conducting the probe behind closed doors.\n\nJordan revealed that only about 12 members of Congress have witnessed the testimonies so far, telling reporters Monday:\n\nIn those total of 20 hours of interview that [Former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt] Volker and [Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie] Yovanovitch, I think there have been a total of 12 members of Congress in those interviews, which means 423 members of Congress weren\u2019t present to hear testimony from the witnesses that Mr. Schiff has called. Four hundred and twenty-three members of Congress who represent three quarters of a million people don\u2019t know what frankly is going on and at some point it looks like they\u2019re going to be asked to vote on this and that just seems, to me, exactly the wrong way to do this. \u2026 The problem with this whole process is we don\u2019t get to hear some of the substantive stated in these interviews particularly things stated by Amb. Volker where he said there is no quid pro quo whatsoever.\n\nJordan and other GOP lawmakers have called on House Democrats to release the transcripts of the impeachment inquiry witnesses. The Republican lawmakers argue that the transcripts contradict Democrats\u2019 allegation that President Trump made his Ukrainian counterpart a quid pro quo offer to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Trump and the Ukrainian president deny the claims.\n\nOver the weekend, Schiff has defended keeping the impeachment inquiry away from the public eye.", "description": "The Democrat chairman of the House intelligence panel pursuing the impeachment probe booted Rep.
