Elliott Caggins, project manager for soldier weapons, described to Task & Purpose in February 2019\n\n\"Imagine that Steve Jobs and his engineers were trying to convert the iPod Touch to the first 3G iPhone,\" Caggins said at the time. \"There were a thousand technologies they could have put in the first iPhone, but they were looking to mature the platform before they could actually go onto the system.\"\n\n\"We have hundreds of capabilities we can put into this weapons system, but we want to do it by holistically creating a system that that takes advantage of everything we've done in the past,\" he added. \"This means its capabilities will only grow, just as the iPhone's did.\"\n\nAccording to the sources sought notice, the Army is only accepting new tech concepts for the NGSW through the end of 2019. Army modernization officials previously told Congress recently that the service aims to field the NGSW to soldiers by fall 2021.", "description": "If the Army's Next Generation Squad Weapon program is to produce the iPhone of lethality, then the service wants as many killer apps as possible.", "authors": ["Jared Keller", "Task"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/51d0b3d26bb3f77f29000002-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
