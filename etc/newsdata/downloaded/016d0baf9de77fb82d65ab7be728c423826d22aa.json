Twitter Users Know Where He Can Find It.", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump stood up for his pal and personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Friday, telling reporters that the former New York City mayor is a \u201cgreat gentleman\u201d and a \u201cgreat crime fighter\u201d who \u201clooks for corruption wherever he goes.\u201d\n\nTrump was defending Giuliani amid a widening investigation into Giuliani\u2019s role in an alleged shadow campaign pressing Ukraine to launch a probe into Trump\u2019s political rival Joe Biden and his son. Investigators are now also examining whether Giuliani covertly represented foreign interests, as well as his links to associates charged with illegal campaign contributions.\n\nTwitter users were particularly taken by Trump\u2019s boast about Giuliani looking for corruption. They had suggestions about where the attorney might find it.\n\nHe should look in his bank account. https://t.co/vsdNNGhNXi \u2014 Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) October 25, 2019\n\nIt certainly follows him wherever he goes. \u2014 Robbie Sherwood (@RobbieSherwood) October 25, 2019\n\nI think @realDonaldTrump meant to say, \u201cHe generates corruption wherever he goes...\u201d understandable mistake given #Individual1\u2019s difficulty with the English language.
