Fleabag cleaned up at the Emmys, Booksmart had us all in stitches, and I Think You Should Leave has shown how you do sketch comedy.\n\nBut it turns out we\u2019re all wrong for laughing, because according to Todd Phillips, comedy is dead.\n\nPhillips is currently riding high on a wave of success and controversy for directing Joker, a comic book drama that is equally receiving praise for its grittiness and Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance, and criticism for proposed links to real life violence and incels.\n\nBefore Phillips took on DC\u2019s most iconic villain, he was best known for his work in comedy, having directed and written Road Trip, Old School, Starksy and Hutch, the two The Hangover sequels, and having directed and produced the Golden Globe winning original.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it turns out he left comedy because we\u2019re all too gosh darn sensitive and politically correct.\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair, he said: \u2018Go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture. There were articles written about why comedies don\u2019t work anymore\u2014I\u2019ll tell you why, because all the f***ing funny guys are like, \u201cF*** this s***, because I don\u2019t want to offend you.\u201d\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge would disagree (Picture: Christopher Polk/Variety/REX)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard to argue with 30million people on Twitter. You just can\u2019t do it, right? So you just go, \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d\u2019\n\nAt this point in the interview, I rolled my eyes so hard that I briefly viewed life from the back of my head. I can\u2019t stand people getting their knickers in a twist over so-called woke/PC culture at the best of times \u2013 oh wow, you can\u2019t use racist slurs anymore, I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 but Todd\u2019s comments are even more infuriating because they\u2019re just not true.\n\nComedy is absolutely thriving, and yes, edgy comedy is included in this. The aforementioned Emmy award winning, critically acclaimed Fleabag opens series one with Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character engaging in anal sex with a well-endowed man and proceeding to question the size of her anus.\n\nThe hysterical I Think You Should Leave pushes the boundaries of sketch comedy in 16 minute bites. A Girls Trip sequel is planned after the original \u2013 a film where Tiffany Haddish\u2019s character pees all over a crowd, drugs her mates and acts out the oral sex act \u2018grapefruiting\u2019 on a banana \u2013 made $140million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, Girls Trip was an exception to the rule, as comedies aren\u2019t the box office hits they used to be (The Hangover had a worldwide gross of $467 million). But that\u2019s not because people are too \u2018woke\u2019 to go see them anymore.\n\nComedies just aren\u2019t the draw anymore, with production companies preferring to plough their money into comic book movies, which are the trend du jour and will bring in billions. Trends are cyclical, and at the moment, studios just aren\u2019t willing to spend big budgets on comedies.\n\nGirls Trip wasn\u2019t exactly squeaky clean (Picture: Michele K Short/Universal/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t making money elsewhere. Netflix is splashing out on comedy specials from some of the biggest and most bankable stand-ups on the circuit \u2013 and yes, they\u2019re being \u2018edgy\u2019.\n\nIf you like your comedy un-PC, you have Dave Chapelle in Sticks and Stones making jokes about child abuse and not believing Michael Jackson\u2019s accusers. Un-woke comedy is alive and well, folks, so saying people are too sensitive for it to be produced is a lie.\n\nThe actual issue is that this kind of comedy is now being criticised, and the real sensitive people are those who can\u2019t handle having their work critiqued.\n\nTodd Phillips\u2019 last comedy was The Hangover Part III, which has a rating of 20 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. It didn\u2019t receive that rating because PC, woke lefties made it that Todd couldn\u2019t make edgy jokes anymore. It just wasn\u2019t that good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlaming the climate for your movie sucking makes you the sensitive one, Todd. And, side note, The Hangover \u2013 the actually brilliant one of the trilogy \u2013 was the only film not to have been written by Phillips. Take from that what you will.\n\nMillennials still like comedy, in all forms. We laugh at memes all day, for god\u2019s sake. We\u2019re just not that into marginalised communities being made the butt of the joke, when their existence already sees them attacked on a daily basis.\n\nFor me, somebody making a joke about the trans community or minorities isn\u2019t funny because it\u2019s just lazy. It\u2019s very easy to make a joke about a vulnerable target. It doesn\u2019t make you risky, anybody can do it, and no, your rights aren\u2019t being taken away to say them.\n\nShane Gillis was back on stage making jokes about Asians days after being fired from SNL. Louis CK is still touring and mocking Parkland survivors.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think you can make jokes about uncomfortable topics. Take the Scottish comedian Daniel Sloss. On his current tour, X, there is a large section about sexual assault, while on his Netflix special, DARK, he discusses the death of his sister. And I have watched both and belly laughed. That\u2019s because the victims are never the punchline. That takes a good comedian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnybody can use a slur, or slag off trans people, or put on a racist accent. It\u2019s not that hard, and it doesn\u2019t make you revolutionary. To be a clever comedian, you have to aim a bit higher than that \u2013 and you can\u2019t just blame the \u2018woke\u2019 because you\u2019re not funny anymore.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
