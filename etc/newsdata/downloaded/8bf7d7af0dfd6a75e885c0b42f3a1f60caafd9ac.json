In this way the school gates themselves can be a breeding ground for harmful myths to catch on, spread and ultimately infect parents\u2019 judgment.\u2019\n\nExperts believe many parents are being put off the childhood immunisations by a growing presence of the \u2018anti-vaxx\u2019 lobby on social media.\n\nSome of these activists refer to a 1998 study by disgraced ex-doctor Andrew Wakefield, which linked the MMR jab to autism. Wakefield\u2019s findings were later ruled to be \u2018utterly false\u2019 and he was struck off the medical register in 2010.\n\nBut Mr Stevens warns that Wakefield\u2019s \u2018toxic legacy\u2019 still lingers 20 years on.\n\nIn August, the World Health Organisation declared the UK was no longer measles-free following a sudden surge in rates.\n\nA total of 991 cases were confirmed in 2018, more than three times the number in 2017.\n\nMeasles is highly infectious and, while it usually clears up after ten days, it can sometimes lead to deafness or death.\n\nThe Mail is urging the NHS to roll out an alert system with text messages or letters reminding parents of appointments.\n\nWe urgently want to see the fall in uptake reversed, to such an extent that we hit a 95 per cent coverage across all ten childhood jabs.\n\nThis crucial figure is the World Health Organisation\u2019s target as it ensures \u2018herd immunity\u2019 from a virus \u2013 where so few people have it that it cannot spread any further.\n\nMeasles surge is killing thousands worldwide as plummeting vaccine rates lead to an 'alarming upsurge'\n\nBy Eleanor Hayward for the Daily Mail\n\nMeasles is staging a devastating comeback that is killing thousands of children around the globe, the World Health Organisation warned yesterday.\n\nPlummeting vaccination rates have led to an \u2018alarming upsurge in measles cases in all regions\u2019, including the UK, experts said.\n\nThere were 364,808 cases of measles reported to the WHO in the first six months of this year \u2013 triple the amount in 2018 and the highest level since 2006.\n\nSeveral countries are currently battling deadly outbreaks, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 4,000 people have died of measles already this year.\n\nPlummeting vaccination rates have led to an \u2018alarming upsurge in measles cases in all regions\u2019, including the UK, experts said (stock image of child with measles rash)\n\nYesterday Dr Kate O\u2019Brien, director of the WHO\u2019s department of immunisation, said \u2018critical gaps\u2019 in coverage are causing \u2018widespread loss of life and disability\u2019.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Geneva, Dr O\u2019Brien said the UK was an example of a high-income country where falling vaccine coverage is particularly concerning.\n\nShe said: \u2018There are countries that have recently lost their measles-free status, including the Czech Republic and the UK.\n\n\u2018There has been an upsurge in measles in every region of the world, both in outbreaks, the total number of cases and number of deaths.\n\n\u2018The fundamental root cause of that in every country is a failure of children to be adequately vaccinated and receive both doses of the measles vaccine.\u2019\n\nThe WHO says 95 per cent of the population must have two vaccinations \u2013 at age one and age three \u2013 to adequately protect against measles and preserve \u2018herd immunity\u2019. But latest global figures show about 86 per cent coverage with a first measles vaccine dose and less than 70 per cent for a second dose.\n\nThere has been a resurgence of measles around the world since 2016, and WHO experts said the situation was \u2018alarming\u2019.\n\nIn Europe, the number of cases in the first half of 2019 outstripped that for the whole of last year. Nearly 90,000 cases and 37 deaths were reported across 48 of the 53 countries in the European region between January and June this year.\n\nMajor outbreaks of the illness have also killed thousands in Madagascar, the Philippines, Sudan, Thailand and Ukraine.\n\nIn the UK just 90.3 per cent of children had their first dose in 2018-19, down from 91.2 per cent the year before. And just 86.4 per cent had received their second dose by their fifth birthday.\n\nWe MUST stop school gates being a breeding ground for MMR myths, says NHS England Chief Executive SIMON STEVENS\n\nBy Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS England, for the Daily Mail\n\nSimon Stevens (pictured) says school gates have become \u2018breeding grounds\u2019 for toxic myths about childhood jabs\n\nSome of the first patients to come through the doors of the NHS would have been afflicted with the polio virus, responsible for as many as 8,000 cases of paralysis and hundreds of deaths every year during the fearful epidemics of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nAt the time, the world\u2019s solution to polio extended only to the iron lung, with public authorities offering little hope of protection \u2013 or indeed survival \u2013 once anyone was infected with this lethal disease.\n\nThankfully, prevention, treatment and care have come on dramatically in the 70-plus years since the NHS was founded. Only a decade after the birth of the health service, polio cases dropped dramatically as a result of the introduction of routine vaccination.\n\nThanks to greater public awareness, improved research and better health services, we have seen devastating conditions \u2013 including polio and smallpox \u2013 go from being a common concern for every family to relics of a bygone era.\n\nUntil recently we thought the same was true for measles. But worryingly, the World Health Organisation has announced that our country is no longer measles-free.\n\nAnd just last week it was confirmed that the vaccination rate for two-year-olds getting their first MMR dose has dropped for the fifth consecutive year, hitting 90.3 per cent, leaving one in ten children at risk.\n\nCrucially, this rate is below the 95 per cent threshold where a critical mass of people is protected, creating a \u2018herd immunity\u2019 that keeps the whole population safe. That matters, because for children who can\u2019t be vaccinated \u2013 for example, if they are being treated for cancer \u2013 their life depends on other children having had the jab to keep infection at bay.\n\nSo getting vaccinated against killer diseases is not only safe but essential to keeping you, your family and your community healthy.\n\nDropped rates of vaccination mean many more people are vulnerable and exposed to risk, and all it takes for a whole society to be in danger is for one person to catch a disease and start a contagion.\n\nThe recent World Health Organisation report warned that Brits have effectively imported illness following holidays abroad.\n\nThere are, of course, complex reasons why someone may not get their child protected, with no single reason being pinpointed for the steady decline.\n\nOver the coming year, the NHS is going to be making it easier for parents to get their children vaccinated, and GP practices continue to play a key part in vaccinating young people who have missed out.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lively debate about whether children should be expected to be up to date with immunisations before they can start school.\n\nBut among those factors that experts cite for the drop in uptake of this simple health precaution is so-called \u2018vaccine hesitancy\u2019. In the 1990s, a concerted and discredited effort by disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield scared people into thinking vaccinations were dangerous. His toxic legacy lingers, with some still believing his pseudoscience and spurious claims.\n\nTelling parents it\u2019s dangerous to get vaccinated is like telling them it\u2019s dangerous for their child to look left and right before crossing the street.\n\nThe Lancet medical journal reported recently that \u2018vaccine-hesitant\u2019 parents are not just those who are unaware of immunisation, but actually those who have sought out \u2013 often online \u2013 additional information, and no doubt reassurance, about vaccinations. This means that, cruelly, it can be parents who go the extra mile to try to do the right thing and make an informed decision \u2013 whether by doing more research online, asking their friends or fellow parents \u2013 who are liable to stumble on and be deceived by \u2018fake news\u2019.\n\nIn this way the school gates themselves can be a breeding ground for harmful myths to catch on, spread and ultimately infect parents\u2019 judgment.\n\nThat parents\u2019 efforts and anxiety to make the right decision for their children are jeopardised by wilful misinformation is unacceptable. Fortunately, some firms are taking action in response to my calls to both clamp down on fake news and help parents navigate to a safe haven of verified information online.\n\nInstagram has committed to blocking content on its site that promotes demonstrably false health news, Facebook has said it will use its algorithms to make this dangerous content less prominent, Twitter is bringing in a function to direct people to legitimate health resources and Google improved its search function so it prioritises NHS information on vaccinations.\n\nSo, when people search for information on vaccinations, they get the right information first time.\n\nWith parents often taking their cue from other mums and dads, there must be a zero-tolerance approach to misinformation, while the Government\u2019s strategy on improving vaccination levels will help to drive action.\n\nWhile the National Health Service and the families we help must continue to demand more concerted action from websites to stamp out efforts to mislead mums, dads and carers, there are thankfully simple steps they can take to shut out the noise and keep children safe.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is given through two quick and pain-free jabs: one at age one and the next at three years and four months. Both doses are essential for immunity to take effect.\n\nFor any parent in doubt, the health service is making verified information more accessible: the NHS website \u2013 nhs.uk \u2013 is now a trusted source of evidence-based advice, including on the importance of vaccinations.\n\nIn a world where often so much of the focus is on new drugs and cutting-edge technology, one of the most effective tools for keeping us all safe is a simple, free jab, conveniently available at your local GP practice, which can save the life of your child or grandchild.", "description": "Simon Stevens says well-meaning parents are spreading 'harmful rumours' about jabs - particularly MMR - and affecting others' judgment.", "authors": ["Sophie Borland For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/23/19609286-0-image-a-21_1570831475659.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
