That is, in my opinion, a traitor.\u201d\n\nBrexit Party leader and MEP Nigel Farage commented in response to the outburst: \u201cThis man is more unhinged than ever.\u201d\n\nEurophile Verhofstadt Smashes Border Wall With Own Head in Bizarre New EU Election Ad https://t.co/mzYpPaZ1Lq \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 28, 2019\n\nWhile his colleague Martin Daubney responded to the liberal MEP, saying: \u201cMr Verhofstadt, you do not believe in democracy unless it suits you and except for when you win. When you lose, you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nMr Verhofstadt is a committed EU federalist known for his bombastic, and at times inflammatory, language. In February, the EP Brexit coordinator suggested Leavers could end up on the guillotine, like the leaders of the French revolution.\n\n\u201cI think Gove is Brissot, Boris Johnson is Danton, and Rees-Mogg is compared to Robespierre. But we should not forget that the efforts of these men were not appreciated by the Common Man they claimed to represent because they all ended up on the guillotine,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe senior liberal politician recently called for the European Union to become an empire. Speaking at a Liberal Democrat rally in the UK before May\u2019s European Parliament elections, he said: \u201cThe world of tomorrow is a world of empires, in which we Europeans, and you British, can only defend your interests, your way of life, by doing it together, in a European framework, and in European union.\u201d", "description": "Progressive-liberal MEP Guy Verhofstadt has accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson and fellow Tory Brexiteers of being the \"real traitors\".", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Guy-Verhofstadt-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
