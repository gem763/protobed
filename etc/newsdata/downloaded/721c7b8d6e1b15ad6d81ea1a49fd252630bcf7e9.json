The latest is revered director Martin Scorsese, who caused uproar when he claimed that the Avengers franchise \u201cisn\u2019t cinema\u201d.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time someone has taken aim at the apparent lack of artistry in Marvel films, but Scorsese is undoubtedly the most prolific. And while you can understand, in a way, his concern for Marvel\u2019s dominance over the film industry, it\u2019s difficult to see this as anything other than downright snobbery.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He churned out doomed romances such as Romeo and Juliet, or classic tales of madness and revenge like Hamlet or Macbeth, with a few jokes about male genitalia thrown in for good measure.\n\nAs Lawrence W Levine pointed out in his 1988 work Highbrow/Lowbrow, Shakespeare plays were marketed in a very similar way to the blockbusters of today: as epic, spectacular works full of melodrama and special effects. Yet over time, intellectualists wrestled a distinction between Shakespeare the populist and Shakespeare the genius, and with the growth of literacy, the oral traditions that made his work so accessible were abandoned.\n\nSuggesting people can\u2019t enjoy Marvel films and Scorsese movies is like saying those who drink Diet Coke can\u2019t also appreciate a good glass of wine. Nowadays, someone claiming to enjoy \u201chighbrow\u201d culture tends to infer a sense of refinement that comes from limiting their intake of authors, filmmakers and musicians.\n\nIndeed, some people seem to have such good taste in art it\u2019s a wonder they enjoy anything at all. Others try to make their appetite for \u201clowbrow\u201d culture acceptable by over-intellectualising it. Just take a look at the thousands of unnecessary think pieces about shows such as Love Island and Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which simply ruins the appeal of these shows for the masses \u2013 just as it did with Shakespeare.\n\nFor myself and my colleagues who commission pieces for The Independent, there\u2019s a conscious attempt to steer clear of this. Modern audience tastes are more omnivorous than ever, as are my own, so I don\u2019t see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t run a long read about Jane Austen alongside a glowing review of the latest Avengers film, or why my weekly playlist can\u2019t include the latest pop hits next to some of 2019\u2019s critical darlings. I love it all. As Whoopi Goldberg once rightly and wonderfully said: \u201cArt and life are subjective. Not everybody\u2019s gonna dig what I dig, but I reserve the right to dig it.\u201d\n\nYours,\n\nRoisin O\u2019Connor\n\nMusic correspondent", "description": "Numerous public figures have castigated adults who enjoy popular culture, or, as some put it, \u201clowbrow\u201d.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s grown-up fans going to see the latest Toy Story movie or Marvel obsessives freaking out over a new Guardians of the Galaxy trailer \u2013 some people just can\u2019t seem to help but sneer.
