Trump reacted immediately, twitting that the Fed has \u2018no guts, no sense, no vision.\u2019\n\n\n\nJerome Powell downplayed the recent repo crisis, but lowered the excess reserve rate to 1.8% to release the pressure on short-term borrowing costs, and said that the Fed could \u2018resume organic growth of balance sheet,\u2019 hinting that asset purchases may be down the road to remove the need for further repo operations.\n\n\n\nThe Fed decision sparked no enthusiasm among equity investors. The S&P500 closed 0.03% higher; the Dow Jones (+0.13%) did just a bit better. Nasdaq erased 0.11%.\n\n\n\nAsia traded on mixed sentiment. Hang Seng (-1.01%) slid, Shanghai\u2019s Composite (-0.09%) remained quiet, while ASX 200 added 0.45% as communication stocks rallied 2.30%. Disappointing employment data fueled dovish rate expectations in Australia.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained rates unchanged, said it would review economy and prices at the next meeting. The yen strengthened to 107.80 against the US dollar, and Japanese stocks gave back earlier gains.\n\n\n\nUS equity futures were offered in Asia.\n\n\n\nFTSE futures (-0.26%) edged lower, hinting at a soft start in London.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE is expected to slip below the 7300p at the open.\n\n\n\nWTI crude found support near the $58 a barrel, after the US oil inventories increased by 1.1 million barrels last week, versus 2.1 million declines expected by analysts. IEA director Fatih Birol said that there is enough oil on the market and that the US doesn\u2019t need to tap into the emergency reserves as a result of the production disruption in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia accused Iran of being responsible for the Aramco drone attacks, though indirectly. Donald Trump said that the US would respond with \u2018some very significant sanctions\u2019 within the next 48 hours. Escalating tensions between the US and Iran should keep oil prices sustained despite worries of building stockpiles and slowing global demand.\n\n\n\nBoE to leave its policy unchanged despite softening inflation\n\n\n\nThe pound slid after the EU\u2019s Juncker warned that a no-deal Brexit is now \u2018palpable.\u2019 It is fair to say that anyone who discusses with Boris Johnson would turn pessimistic regarding a positive outcome in the utterly complicated Brexit procedure which demands significant compromises from both sides. Anyway, the UK Supreme Court will decide whether British MPs could return to parliament following a controversial suspension before the crucial October 31st deadline. As the UK outlawed to leave the EU without a deal on that date and given that the chances of a Brexit deal are almost non-existent by then, the UK will likely remain part of the EU clique for at least three more months.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the inflation in Britain eased from 2.1% to 1.7% in August despite a significantly weaker pound during that month. The soft inflation read inhibited longer-term interest rate expectations and further weighed on the pound. The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to maintain its monetary policy unchanged at today\u2019s meeting, as Governor Mark Carney will continue assuming an orderly Brexit while keeping an eye on the looming downside risks.\n\n\n\nWith the worst Brexit scenarios fully priced in, the pound traders could find interesting dip-buying opportunities below the 1.25 level against the US dollar. A negative outcome regarding Johnson\u2019s parliament suspension could send the pound rallying past 1.25, the major 38.2% retracement on March \u2013 September decline, indicate a short-term bullish reversal with the possibility of a further rise toward 1.2670 (50% retrace) and 1.2738 (200-day moving average).\n\n\n\nHelvetic rates to stay unchanged, as well.\n\n\n\nSwiss policymakers are also expected to stay pat at today\u2019s monetary policy meeting, as the depreciation in the Swiss franc despite the ECB and the Fed rate cuts gained some time for the Swiss National Bank (SNB), who should think about what to do with the sight deposit rate which stands at an already disputed -0.75% level. Further lowering the Swiss rates may or may not discourage capital from pouring into the franc.\n\n\n\nSmothered with too much love, the strong franc is a serious headache for Swiss exporters. Though luxury and high-priced Swiss products may temper a part of the franc\u2019s strength, the deteriorating global economy inevitably weighs on Swiss businesses beyond its borders.\n\n\n\nThe Swiss GDP growth declined to 0.2% in the second quarter, versus 0.9% expected by analysts. The previous 1.7% read was revised significantly lower to 1.0%. Exports in July fell 1.8%, and the August release may not tell a better story given that the franc hit its highest levels on that month against the greenback since September 2018.\n\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the activity in the Euroswiss futures market hinted at the possibility of lower Swiss rates during August. Although the dovish SNB expectations dulled in September, they revealed that an increased number of investors have started wondering whether a 25-basis-point cut could be on the SNB\u2019s agenda for the upcoming meetings.\n\n\n\nWith the franc giving back gains, more data points should help policymakers assessing if the downturn may have helped to improve the fundamentals. But a thing is clear; a softer franc would do no harm to the Swiss economy. Hence, Helvetic policymakers will be faced with the reality of easing monetary conditions elsewhere, especially in the Eurozone, and could be brought to act sooner rather than later.\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 14 points lower at 7300\n\n\n\nto open 2 points lower at 12388\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
