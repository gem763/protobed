In addition, 700 employees who entered the executive ranks before 2011 will have their supplementary pension benefits put on hold.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHere's how GE employees may be impacted\n\nA GE engineer who makes $150,000 a year and receives a pension benefit of $200 a month for every year of service at that salary level will see this payment frozen\n\nAn employee in their 60s and has been at the company for almost 40 years and is set to receive a pension benefit of $7,700 a month won\u2019t see much of an impact from Monday\u2019s announcement as their time worked cannot be undone\n\nThere is no change for GE retirees already collecting pension benefits or employees with production benefits\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a big deal for someone who is in their 40s and planning to work another 15 years \u2013 that\u2019s another $3,000 a month that they won\u2019t be receiving in retirement\n\nMoore also thinks the decision could cause younger employees to leave the company, but he is specifically concerned about the executives who will have their supplementary pension benefits taken away.\n\n\u201cThose are the executive band level and hire people, and those are the cream of the crop at GE,\u201d he said. \u201cThose supplementary pension numbers, depending on how much you're making and all the other stuff, could add up to a couple hundred thousand dollars a year in lost benefits at this point. The talent drain is a concern.\u201d\n\nMoore says GE employees, and anyone else planning for retirement should take into account three facets of retirement planning: your income, your expenses and how much your investments can plug the difference if your income's going to drop by feasibly half of what you thought it was going to be.\n\n\u201cI think this should be a general wake up call for people to make sure that they're a lot closer to their planning goals and that they get questions answered obviously selfishly from people like us that have done this for hundreds of employees,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut I think that the people that are already engaged with planners it's going to be pretty easy too. Do it yourselfers are going to probably have a wake-up call and they should probably get some help\" he advised.\n\nThe changes to the pension plan will help GE reduce its pension deficit by as much as $8 billion and its net debt by up to $6 billion.\n\n\u201cReturning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today\u2019s decision to freeze the pension is no exception,\u201d said Kevin Cox, chief human resources officer at General Electric, in a press release.\n\n\u201cWe carefully weighed market trends and our strategic priority to improve our financial position with the impact to our employees. We are committed to helping our employees through this transition.\u201d\n\nThe decision will have wide-ranging implications for the financial future of General Electric employees, and the employees of other companies and cities and states that have and will have similar cuts to their pension plans, according to Moore.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The retirement landscape is changing for the American worker.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/istock-622064048-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
