Banks rely on those contracts to fund short-term obligations, but had trouble finding the money they needed on Tuesday. That sent rates spiking to 10% from a little over 2%.\n\nMarket participants said a confluence of events caused the cash crunch. Corporations withdrew funds from money-market accounts to cover their tax bills. On the same day, banks and investors used idle dollars to absorb $78 billion in U.S. Treasury notes.\n\nAnother factor was the Fed's effort to shrink its balance sheet. Bank reserves parked there overnight \u2013 which can be made available to other banks if needed \u2013 are at their lowest level since 2011.\n\nBut bankers also pointed to the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, as an exacerbator of repo-market stress.\n\nThe rule requires U.S. lenders with more than $250 billion in assets to hold a large pool of high-quality, easily tradeable assets that can cover cash outflows during times of extreme stress.\n\nIronically, said Nelson, that meant lenders could not use those idle funds to back overnight trades during this week's stress.\n\n\"Rather than having the Fed lend to banks in stress once every generation or so at some (very minimal) risk to taxpayers, current solutions tend towards the Fed acting as a regular market participant at direct risk to taxpayers,\" he wrote. The Bank Policy Institute had warned in recent weeks that money markets looked poised to encounter volatility, due in part to the liquidity rule. Its members include JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (N: ), Citigroup Inc (N: ) and Wells Fargo & Co (N: ), the four largest U.S. banks.\n\nAt a press conference on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell disputed the idea that the LCR needed to change.\n\n\"It's not impossible that we could come to a view that the LCR is calibrated too high, but that's not something we think right now,\" he said.\n\nThe Fed is in the process of reviewing its capital and liquidity rules after Congress passed a bank deregulation bill in 2018. The central bank's vice chairman, Randal Quarles, is leading the effort.\n\nUnder a \"tailoring\" proposal it drew up, banks with less than $700 billion in assets could see their liquidity requirements drop by as much as 30%. But standards for globally systemic banks like JPMorgan are not expected to change meaningfully.\n\nBankers have complained often and loudly about the LCR's impact on profits since its implementation in 2015. They have also met frequently with Quarles to push their views on liquidity and capital requirements since President Donald Trump appointed him.\n\nHis most recently available calendars show meetings and calls with executives or board members from JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N: ), Capital One Financial Corp (N: ), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N: ), State Street Corp (N: ), as well as representatives of the Bank Policy Institute, the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Forum and the Institute of International Finance.\n\nAt the event on Wednesday, Dimon said the Fed did the \"right thing\" when it intervened in the repo market. But he emphasized that structural issues need to be fixed.\n\n\"It's not a big deal given that it happened in good times,\" he said. \"If we don't fix the underlying problem, it will hurt the economy in bad times.\"", "description": "U.S. bankers seize on repo-market stress to push for softer liquidity rules", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8H1IZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
