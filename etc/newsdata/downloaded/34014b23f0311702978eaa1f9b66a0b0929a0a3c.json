Those shifting some of their investments into riskier assets was 13 per cent.\n\nThe survey called this reaction to the volatility \"knee-jerk\", and Schroders distribution head Graeme Mather said investors were making themselves more vulnerable by chasing high-returns amid global uncertainty.\n\n\"We've always known that investors will typically make decisions when markets become volatile,\" he said. \"Typically, history has taught us they make the wrong decisions. Many investors \u2013 when the market goes down \u2013 invest in cash.\"\n\nExpectations inconsistent with market performance\n\nThe expectations of investors were also inconsistent with the performance of stock markets across the last 12 months, with the S &P/ASX200 Index only ticking up 5.4 per cent and the S &P500 jumping 2.3 per cent in that period.\n\nMr Mather said the high hopes were the by-product of high market returns in the past.\n\n\"The last ten years probably contributes to people's expectations,\" he said. \"They're used to seeing high market returns....when you look at the ASX over the last ten years, returns are probably 8 per cent per annum.\"\n\n\"Expectations of investors are still above what equity markets have done over the last ten years, but people have seen high market returns. They are extrapolating that into the future and aren't thinking about current market valuations as much as they should.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther significant findings included that more than half of the respondents were not satisfied with the performance of their investments over the last five years.\n\nInvestors were also biased towards assets local to their region and lacked confidence in expressing how much money they had invested and saved.\n\nMr Mather said that, overall, the results pointed towards a need for more education around investing.\n\n\"The industry needs to work on providing better education to investors to allow them to make decisions or not make decisions if that's more appropriate.\n\n\"The superannuation fund industry and financial advice industry need to be a little better to help investors in that regard.\"", "description": "A new survey found the average investor expected a 10.7 per cent return on investment a year and had \"knee-jerk\" reactions to market volatility", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f2d543e7cb105731290bdae0bf424b3bfb3c574f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
