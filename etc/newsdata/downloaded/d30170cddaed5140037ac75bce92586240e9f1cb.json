Chain, 69, in August 2018 after he made 14 threatening phone calls to the Globe\u2019s newsroom within the span of two weeks.\n\nChain, a resident of Encino, California, first contacted the Globe after the paper publicly urged other news organizations to join it in a coordinated response to the surge of political attacks on the news media, according to the FBI.\n\nRobert D. Chain, of Encino, CA a was sentenced today in federal court to four months in prison, three years supervised release, a $3,500 fine & was ordered to pay $16,512 in restitution to @BostonGlobe for making violent threats against their employees. https://t.co/NpEHz5SkJY \u2014 FBI Boston (@FBIBoston) October 2, 2019\n\nDuring that call and the others that followed, Chain called the Globe the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and made violent and sexually explicit comments.\n\n\u201cWe are going to shoot you motherfuckers in the head, you Boston Globe cocksuckers. Shoot every fucking one of you,\u201d Chain told Globe employees in one recorded call, according to an FBI affidavit submitted to the court.\n\nOn Aug. 16, 2018, the same day that the Globe published its editorial highlighting political attacks on journalists, Chain told the paper\u2019s employees that he was coming to the newsroom at a particular time to shoot them.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do motherfucker? You ain\u2019t going to do shit,\u201d the affidavit quotes him as saying. \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you in the head later today, at 4 o\u2019clock. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nIn response to that specific threat, local law enforcement was called to the Globe\u2019s building, according to the FBI.\n\nSome of Chain\u2019s slurs echo remarks made by President Donald Trump, who has attacked the news media ever since he launched his first campaign for the presidency. Trump repeatedly calls journalists the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and often declares \u201cfake news\u201d while pointing directly at TV cameras during his rallies.\n\nOn Aug. 22, 2018, per the affidavit, Chain told the Globe he would continue his threats to the paper and \u201cother fake news\u201d if they continued their \u201ctreasonous and seditious acts\u201d against Trump.\n\nIn 2017, Trump tweeted an edited video, originally recorded during an appearance on WrestleMania, showing him body-slamming another man whose head was now replaced by the CNN logo. In response, CNN said the video \u201cencourages violence against reporters.\u201d\n\nIn October of the following year, when a pipe bomb was sent to CNN, Trump said in a tweet that the \u201cgreat anger\u201d in the U.S. was caused by the \u201cFake News Media, the true Enemy of the People.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, Chain pleaded guilty to seven counts of making threatening communications in interstate commerce.\n\nIn addition to his four-month sentence behind bars, Chain has been ordered to serve three years of supervised release and pay a fine of $3,500. He must also pay restitution to the Globe in the amount of $16,512.\n\nIn court for his sentencing on Wednesday, Chain said that issuing those threats was \u201cthe worst decision I ever made\u201d and that he hopes \u201cpeople can forgive me,\u201d the Globe reported.", "description": "Robert D.
