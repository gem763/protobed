(Image: Netflix)\n\nAfter I started recommending The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance to anyone I possibly could, two questions kept cropping up. The first was \u201cDo I have to watch (or re-watch) the movie to understand it?\u201d, but it\u2019s the second that fascinated me the most: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of investing in these characters knowing they\u2019re doomed to fail?\u201d\n\nBecause, yes, Age of Resistance is, as the title implies, a story of resistance, of the Gelfling clans uniting to overthrow the world of Thra\u2019s corrupt overlords, the Skeksis. Except, it\u2019s set many, many years before the events of The Dark Crystal, which \u2014 spoilers but not really, but I guess it does answer the other question \u2014 almost immediately tells the audience that not only do the Skeksis still rule Thra, but that the Gelflings were wiped out almost entirely, save for the movie\u2019s two protagonists, Jen and Kira.\n\nBrea, Deet and Rian, the heroes of Age of Resistance? Even little Hup the Podling Paladin, their adorable friend? They failed. They\u2019re dead. Their resistance doesn\u2019t work.\n\nJen and Kira, just when it seems all hope is lost. (Image: Universal)\n\nOn the surface, this is a depressing realisation to make, especially as you fall in love with these characters and believe in their plight over the course of watching the new show. Depressing enough for some that, as people asked, why should they even bother investing in the first place? But to me, that\u2019s kind of the point of it all, and why a prequel about hope in a time of darkness is much more satisfying for my soul than a tale of tragic inevitability is these days.\n\nThat we know these characters will fail is not important in the context. The point is that they don\u2019t have that foresight. They see that the odds are overwhelming \u2014 when Rian and his allies ultimately rise up against the Skeksis and face them in combat during the climax of the series, they very quickly realise just how hard the battle to come is going to be, and how many of them might not make it. And yet, they resist, they persist, regardless of that fact.\n\nPoor little Hup, bruised by his arc in Age of Resistance, still has more hardships to face. (Image: Netflix)\n\nWhat point is there to resistance without the threat of failure to overcome in the first place? It\u2019s there that hope shines brightest, and at its most beautiful. The ultimate thesis by the end of Age of Resistance isn\u2019t that it\u2019s sad that these characters will fail. It\u2019s that we should take solace in the glimmer of hope that they have achieved, ahead of a fight still to come, and used it to carry on fighting in the face of a dire fate.\n\nIn an age of prequels and cyclical sequels, it\u2019s an idea we\u2019re starting to see a lot of in our pop culture.\n\nIt\u2019s actually something that Steven Universe: The Movie just championed.\n\nSet several years after the most recent events of the show in a \u201chappily ever after\u201d scenario, Steven ultimately realises that \u2014 after confronting a new villain \u2014 not only is his ability to acknowledge change and growth as vital a superpower as his Crystal Gem abilities, but that state of victorious hope, that happily ever after, is not a state to exist in but one that must perpetually be chased for it to feel earned in the first place.\n\nYou can make it different, you can make it right. You can make it better \u2014 we don\u2019t have to fight. You can make an effort, starting with tonight \u2014 \u2019cause you, you can make a change. (Image: Cartoon Network)\n\nFrom one series about space jewels to another, it\u2019s an idea that has come to define Star Wars, both meta-textually and within its narrative. It can be frustrating at times that the Star Wars sequels are dredging up the plot beats of the franchise\u2019s past with a shiny lick of paint \u2014 a new war to fight, a new empire to rise, a new rebellion to defeat them \u2014 from a thematic perspective.\n\nBut there\u2019s something to be said about the power of facing such a despair-laden realisation that some fights have no end, with the idea that the realisation doesn\u2019t make the decision to fight pointless.\n\nIf anything, it makes the pan-generational legacy of Star Wars\u2019 themes of hope and resistance that much more enduring. After all, by having a movie like The Last Jedi pointing its criticisms of that cycle of failed resistances directly at the establishments that perpetuate it in the first place (and saying that lasting change can only be brought about by radically overhauling those establishments, or getting rid of them altogether), its message of hope becomes much more nuanced and subversive than simply Dark vs. Light.\n\nBut we\u2019re also seeing it reflected inversely \u2014 and how the idea of a hero\u2019s deserved rest can come across as incredibly selfish instead of an earned reward.\n\nTake Captain America\u2019s arc in Avengers: Endgame for example, still inspiring frenzied debate (among fans and among the team behind Endgame\u2019s story, who seemingly cannot come to a solid agreement on the actual mechanics of the film\u2019s paradoxical take on time travel and alternate realities) months after the movie released.\n\nOn the surface, Steve\u2019s happily ever after with Peggy is a reward, his decision to leave the fight he has burdened for so long to have time to himself.\n\nA happily ever after earned, or selfishly taken? (Image: Marvel Studios)\n\nUpon the realisation that it requires Steve sitting out on myriad injustices in his own parallel reality before returning to close the loop with Sam Wilson, it can read almost like a betrayal. A character defined by his steadfast hope and persistence \u2014 the man who triumphantly stands back up and says \u201cI could do this all day\u201d \u2014 specifically choosing to peace out of said fight, for the sake of another timeline, and his own desires.\n\nInstead of continuing to fight the good fight with the chance the Infinity Stones give him \u2014 with the context of knowing that it ultimately all has to culminate with one of his closest friends sacrificing his life \u2014 he leaves it up to someone else. A thought far more depressing than the fact that all our Gelfling heroes in Age of Resistance are dead and buried by the time of the movie.\n\nIn the end, however, it all comes back to that idea of having hope even if we know at some point down the line there will be losses \u2014 existential, spiritual, or otherwise (arguably all three in the case of Dark Crystal, considering the Gelfling believe that in death they are returned to Thra\u2019s life essence). It\u2019s not knowing that it will pay off that really matters; it\u2019s about having hope in the first place, and acting upon it without knowing if it will.\n\nIt\u2019s a message we could all do with in our own lives, every now and then \u2014 a reminder that it\u2019s a brave choice to persist in the face of the unknown, in spite of hardship and strife. There\u2019s no better message we can ask of our stories than to inspire a little hope of our own.", "description": "After I started recommending The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance to anyone I possibly could, two questions kept cropping up.
