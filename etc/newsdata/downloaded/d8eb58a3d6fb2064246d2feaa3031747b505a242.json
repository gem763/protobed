Griswold refers to this group as \u201cthe reading class,\u201d and\u2014adding up the NEA\u2019s \u201cfrequents\u201d and \u201cavids,\u201d and considering rates of serious reading in other similarly wealthy countries\u2014reckons that about 20 percent of adults belong to the U.S.\u2019s reading class. She said that a larger proportion of the American population qualified as big readers between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries\u2014an era of reading that was made possible by advances in printing technology and then, eventually, snuffed out by television.\n\nSome people are much more likely than others to become members of the reading class. \u201cThe patterns are very, very predictable,\u201d Griswold told me. First, and most intuitively, the more education someone has, the more likely they are to be a reader. Beyond that, she said, \u201curban people read more than rural people,\u201d \u201caffluence is associated with reading,\u201d and \u201cyoung girls read earlier\u201d than boys do and \u201ccontinue to read more in adulthood.\u201d Race matters, too: The NEA\u2019s data indicate that 60 percent of white American adults reported reading a book in the last year outside of work or school, which was a higher rate than for African Americans (47 percent), Asians (45 percent), and Hispanic people (32 percent). (Some of these correlations could simply reflect the strong connection between education and reading.)\n\nOf course, possessing any of these characteristics doesn\u2019t guarantee that someone will or won\u2019t become a reader. Personality also seems to play a role. \u201cIntroverts seem to be a little bit more likely to do a lot of leisure-time reading,\u201d Daniel Willingham, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, told me.\n\nWillingham also talked about the importance, which many researchers have examined, of the number of books in one\u2019s childhood home. Studies looking at \u201cfamily scholarly culture\u201d have found that children who grew up surrounded by books tend to attain higher levels of education and to be better readers than those who didn\u2019t, even after controlling for their parents\u2019 education.\n\nThe mere presence of books is not magically transformative. \u201cThe question is, I take a child who\u2019s not doing very well in school, and I put 300 books in their house\u2014now what happens?,\u201d Willingham said. \u201cAlmost certainly the answer is, not a lot. So what is it? Either what are people doing with those books, or is this sort of a temperature read of a much broader complex of attitudes and behaviors and priorities that you find in that home?\u201d\n\nIt is almost tautological to observe that being a reader sets a child up for academic success, since so much of school is reading. And that means-to-an-end argument in support of reading says nothing of the many joys it can bring. But even though plenty of people simply don\u2019t enjoy reading (or have trouble enjoying it, possibly because of a learning or attention disorder), it\u2019s a vital skill. It may be dispiriting that people have little, if any, say over many of the predictors of whether they or their children will be readers, but thankfully, there are also a number of other factors that are within people\u2019s control.", "description": "A lot rides on how parents present the activity to their kids.", "authors": ["Joe Pinsker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_949562522/facebook.jpg?1568834805", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
