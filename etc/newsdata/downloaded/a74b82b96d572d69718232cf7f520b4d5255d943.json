Listing the items of that agenda, he said the political difficulty of legislating it all would not deter him.\n\n\u201cA gun registry in this country, licensing for every American who owns a firearm, and every single one of those AR-15\u2019s and AK-47s will be bought back so they are not in our streets, not in our homes, do not take the lives of our fellow Americans,\u201d he said to loud applause. \u201cAnd we are going to do that together.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Freebeacon.Com Politics Orourke-El-Paso-Shooting-Occurred-At-The-Invitation-Of-Our-President"], "top_image": ""}
