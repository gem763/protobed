She went missing on September 19 and was last seen on the campus.\n\nNearly one-third of protesters arrested since June are under the age of 18\n\nHer body was found in the sea near Tseung Kwan O on September 22. The girl, who was a member of her school\u2019s swimming team, was said to have attended anti-government protests regularly.\n\nPolice have said that an investigation found nothing suspicious about her death. The force also confirmed the girl was not arrested during recent protests\n\nChief Superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung said last week that the surveillance footage from Youth College showed she left her possessions on the campus before walking barefoot towards the waterfront near Tseung Kwan O on September 19. She was reported missing two days later.\n\n(Left) Dr. Leung Hing-pong, VTC Academic Director of IT Discipline meets people as students sit-in at Tseung Kwan O to demand VTC release CCTV of the deceased girl.

How could she end up like this?\u201d a masked female student who was protesting at HKDI said.\n\n\u201cRelease the CCTV footage, reveal the truth,\u201d her fellow students chanted.\n\nThe protest started early on Monday morning with dozens of students staging a sit-in on the campus.\n\nStudents plan rally at HKU against alleged police brutality\n\nAround 5pm, Youth College principal Jerry Kwok Lung-kei and the school staff agreed to show selected footage to the press and about 100 students.\n\nTwo clips were shown, the first filmed by a camera in a car park and the second from inside a lift.\n\nThe first clip showed the entrance to a car park, with only a sliver at the top of the screen where people could be seen walking past. When the time reached 18:56, a member of staff paused the video to point out a person dressed in black as the deceased girl. The students voiced their disapproval, as they found it very difficult to identify who the person was from the low-resolution footage.\n\nPeople and students at VTC watch CCTV footage of the deceased student.

At this, the students accused the authorities of showing them an edited version of the video.\n\nThe second clip, which carried no time stamp, was of better resolution. In the footage, the girl was only seen entering a lift, after which the school staff declined to show any further footage. This angered the students who wanted to see what happened afterwards.\n\nThey threatened to escalate their protests if the school authority did not come up with what they believed was complete and unedited footage by 6.02pm \u2013 a 30-minute deadline they imposed on the management.\n\nMental health is at an all-time low in Hong Kong, amid months of protests\n\nAs the authority refused to oblige, the students smashed the school\u2019s glass doors, painted graffiti on its walls, damaged surveillance cameras and also turned on fire hydrant hoses.\n\nThe chaos lasted for about half an hour until all the students dispersed. Fire service personnel rushed in to the campus at around 6.30pm to respond to a fire alarm that was set off.\n\nThe Vocational Training Council later said in a statement that due to the situation on campus, all classes on the Tiu Keng Leng campus of the HKDI, Youth College and other institutions would remain cancelled between October 15 and 17.", "description": "Classes have been cancelled for the next three days after angry students smash glass doors and graffiti walls, demanding full footage of the 15-year-old protester found dead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/ea02cf1e-ee78-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires084717.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
