There is only one Phoebe Waller-Bridge to go round, making her physical presence incredibly valuable. As both an actor and a writer, she is in high demand; she reportedly had to pass on writing for the second series of Killing Eve because her schedule is packed with Bond films and Star Wars cameos and God knows what else. Seeing Waller-Bridge do Fleabag this one final time, therefore, carries potent bragging rights. People I know keep posting Instagram pictures of the set, despite it being ... a single chair.\n\nIt felt less like a traditional theater performance and more like a rock concert: Everyone knew the words. As a play, Fleabag gets its emotional punch from a twist\u2014a revelation of its protagonist\u2019s bad behavior\u2014and so the story line is inevitably less powerful on subsequent viewings. But that didn\u2019t seem to matter to the crowd. Just as everyone attends a Rolling Stones gig expecting to hear \u201cGimme Shelter,\u201d so this audience wanted to hear about Tube Rodent, and the guinea-pig caf\u00e9, and Fleabag\u2019s sister\u2019s monthly hair crisis. They saw the punch lines coming. They didn\u2019t care. The laughs started even before the first joke was out.\n\nThis was an encore performance in every sense of the phrase: a lap of honor for a beloved national treasure. When it was revealed last year that the most-watched show on Netflix was The Office, followed by Friends\u2014a cozy sitcom now old enough to vote\u2014it was confirmation that the array of choice offered by modern life has, paradoxically, driven many of us back to our comfort zones. Yes, Netflix has Chinese-language dramas about an emperor\u2019s wives, and Israeli military thrillers, and French shows about celebrity agents. Such riches! And yet we scroll past these for another dose of Ross and Rachel.\n\nFleabag\u2019s opening night was also notable for the presence of Britain\u2019s feminist aristocracy, including its grand duchess, the journalist Caitlin Moran; the lawmaker Stella Creasy; the host of the BBC\u2019s Late Night Woman\u2019s Hour, Lauren Laverne; and the host of The Guilty Feminist podcast, Deborah Frances-White. From the start, the show has been held up as a groundbreaking feminist show, and a show particularly aimed at women.\n\nRead: \u2018Fleabag\u2019 has a poignant insight about sisterhood\n\nMuch has been written about how Fleabag is frank in its discussion of sex, and how it allows a female protagonist to be flawed, selfish, and self-destructive. The main character discovers that she and her sister are \u201cbad feminists\u201d for saying they would trade five years of their lives for the perfect body. She and her friend Boo, played in the TV series by Jenny Rainsford, sing nonsense ukulele songs about \u201cmodern women.\u201d Fleabag talks about periods, and cystitis, and being attracted to Barack Obama. This focus feels both liberating\u2014women can be rude, too!\u2014and limiting. Why is all this just for girls? Why can\u2019t a woman\u2019s art be universal, in the way that Portnoy\u2019s Complaint, that masturbation odyssey, is a Great American Novel, rather than a Great Male American Novel?", "description": "As the groundbreaking show concludes with a final theater run in London, audiences are left to grapple with its meaning.", "authors": ["Helen Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/Phoebe_Waller_Bridge_in_Fleabag_at_Wyndhams_Theatre._Photography_by_Matt_Humphrey_8/facebook.jpg?1567177342"}
