But Van Hollen said on Wednesday that they will introduce legislation next week and want a quick vote.\n\n\"This sanctions bill will be introduced as soon as Congress returns. Will ask for an immediate vote to send a clear message to Turkey that it must cease and desist its military action, withdraw its fighters from the areas under attack, and stop the tragic loss of life,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe bill, according to a fact sheet shared by Graham, would sanction any assets of Turkish leadership, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, within U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nThe bill would also target Turkey's energy sector and military, including sanctions against \"any foreign person who sells or provides financial, material, or technological support or knowingly does a transaction with Turkish military.\"\n\nIt would also prohibit U.S. military sales to Turkey and restrict the ability for Turkey's leadership to travel to the United States.\n\n\"Today @LindseyGrahamSC and I are announcing a framework for sanctions against Turkey to respond to their military operation in northeastern Syria, which is already underway. These sanctions will have immediate, far-reaching consequences for Erdogan and his military,\" Van Hollen tweeted.\n\nOur bill includes sanctions on:\n\n\u2192 Turkey's political leadership\n\n\u2192 Military transactions with Turkey\n\n\u2192 Turkey's domestic energy sector\n\n\n\nIt will also:\n\n\u2192 Prohibit U.S. military support for Turkey\n\n\u2192 Trigger 2017 CAATSA sanctions\n\n\u2192 Restrict U.S. visas for Turkish leadership https://t.co/nugcPRlMFD \u2014 Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen) October 9, 2019\n\nTrump is facing fierce backlash from both sides of the aisle for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria. Lawmakers warn that it could bolster ISIS and endanger the Kurds, who have allied with the United States to fight the terrorist organization.\n\nUnder the bill, sanctions against Turkey would remain in effect until the administration certifies to lawmakers that Ankara has withdrawn its forces from Syria.\n\nTrump distanced himself from Turkey's military operation earlier Wednesday and indicated that he would support additional sanctions.\n\n\u201cI think Lindsey would like to stay there for the next 200 years and maybe add a couple a hundred of thousand people every place, but I disagree with Lindsey on that,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cBut I will tell you that I do agree on sanctions, but I actually think much tougher than sanctions if [Erdo\u011fan] doesn\u2019t do it in as humane a way as possible.\u201d", "description": "Sens.
