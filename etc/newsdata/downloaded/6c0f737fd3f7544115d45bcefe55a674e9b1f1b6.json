And it should be the end of his political career,\u201d Mr Odeh said in a New York Times op-ed.\n\nMr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party put out a furious statement in response. \u201cAs we warned, the Arab parties that oppose Israel as a Jewish and democratic State and glorify terrorists recommended Gantz for prime minister,\u201d the party said.\n\nThe support of the Joint List means that Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, will almost certainly allow Mr Gantz the first chance to form a coalition government. It will be the first time since 2009 that anyone other than Mr Netanyahu has been given the task.\n\nBut that does not mean Mr Gantz, a former army general, will necessarily succeed in cobbling together a majority. He says he hopes to form a national unity government with Likud but only if Mr Netanyahu, who is facing criminal corruption charges, agrees to resign.\n\nMr Netanyahu is refusing to budge and so far his Likud ministers are remaining loyal to him. If Mr Gantz is unable to form a government within 42 days then Mr Netanyahu will get another chance to take up the task.\n\nIf neither man is successful, Israel could be plunged into an unprecedented third election in a year.\n\nThere were reports last night that both Mr Gantz\u2019s Blue & White and Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud were maneuvering to be allowed to go second in forming a government because they believed the first chance was a poison chalice likely to end in failure.\n\nThe Israeli president said meanwhile that he hoped the two parties could find a way to bridge their differences and come together in a unity government. \u201cA stable government cannot be a government without both of the two largest parties,\u201d Mr Rivlin said.\n\nThe leaders of the Joint List at the president's office Credit: Menahem Kahana/Pool via AP More\n\nWhile the Joint List is backing Mr Gantz to be prime minister, the party will not actually join a potential Gantz government nor adds its 13 seats towards his majority.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman, the leader of a secular nationalist party which holds the balance between pro-Netanyahu and anti-Netanyahu parties in parliament, said he was not backing Mr Gantz or Mr Netanyahu at this stage.\n\nMr Lieberman, who has a history of incendiary rhetoric towards Palestinians, said he could not support Mr Gantz if the Arabs were supporting him. \u201cThey're enemies. Wherever they sit we'll be on the other side.\"\n\nThat leaves Mr Gantz with a perilously narrow path to forming a majority government without joining forces with Likud.", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s grip on power slipped further last night after Israel\u2019s Arab minority party threw its support behind his rival Benny Gantz, virtually guaranteeing that Mr Gantz will get the first chance to form a government.
