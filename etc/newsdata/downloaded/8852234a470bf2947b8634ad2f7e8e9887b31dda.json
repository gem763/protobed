(Washington Post photo/Washington Post photo)\n\nThe signs for tolls along Interstate 66 in Virginia weren\u2019t working properly for about an hour Tuesday morning due to a technical issue, officials said, making it the second day in a row the signs have had troubles.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the signs along the highway inside the Beltway did not come on at 5:30 a.m. as they are supposed to, according to Ellen Kamilakis, a spokeswoman for Virginia\u2019s Department of Transportation. They came on briefly for about 10 minutes around 6 a.m. but then went off. They came back on around 7:15 a.m., she said.\n\nKamilakis said drivers wouldn\u2019t be charged for the time the signs were out and that a 12-minute grace period is being allowed for those who may have been on the road when the toll signs were out.\n\nOfficials said technical experts are looking into the problem.\n\nOn Monday, there was another technical problem with the toll signs as well.\n\nThe tolls run for 10 miles along a stretch of I-66 between the Capital Beltway and the District and charge solo drivers during peak travel times. Motorcycles and vehicles with two or more people aren\u2019t charged.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "Officials said a network outage caused the signs for tolls along I-66 in Virginia to not work properly.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NxXJRe-QTbotMG8u9XgvZjcZsP4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VJL5VRRY34I6RLGVGXVMEMHFCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
