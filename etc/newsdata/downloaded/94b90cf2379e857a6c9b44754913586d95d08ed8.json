I have asked all ministers to make their positions available. We're working to form a new team that represents change,\" Pi\u00f1era tweeted on Saturday, in an effort to assuage the anger of protesters.\n\nJust a day earlier, Chileans had filled downtown Santiago in their calls for change. The city's mayor, Karla Rubilar, estimated that about a million people took part in Friday's demonstration. She wrote that the protesters \"represent the dream of a new Chile.\"\n\nChile had long been seen as a tranquil nation in an increasingly turbulent region. But in the past week, Pi\u00f1era has deployed army troops, and The Guardian reports that hundreds of people were shot during the unrest. The government says at least 20 people have died in the protests, the Associated Press reports.\n\nProtests began over a 4-cent price hike in subway fares, but soon spun out to encompass the significant income inequality in the country.\n\nPi\u00f1era subsequently announced he was raising minimum wage and pensions, capping health care costs, and raising taxes on the wealthy, among a raft of other changes under the name Nueva Agenda Social.\n\nFor some, it's not enough. Thousands of protesters gathered again on Saturday evening in the plazas of cities across Chile, according to the AP.\n\nCurfews were lifted in many places on Saturday and Sunday. The country has been in a state of emergency for nine days, which Pi\u00f1era indicated he may soon lift.", "description": "\"We have all heard and understood the message of Chileans,\" Sebastian Pi\u00f1era said. \"We're working to form a new team that represents change.\" A million people took part in Friday's demonstration.", "authors": ["Laurel Wamsley"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/27/gettyimages-1178326364_wide-9280b80e6b062a20b98b13672095d50792e346de.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
