There are dozens of other places out there with their own water crises,\" Copeny told TODAY, as part of our Groundbreakers series for International Day of the Girl. (Both Newark and Pittsburgh have recently come under scrutiny for potentially contaminated water.)\n\nCopeny was only 8 years old when she wrote a letter to Obama about what was happening in her hometown.\n\n\"Little Miss Flint\" Mari Copeny, then 8 years old, hugs former President Barack Obama during an event in Flint, Michigan, in 2016.

And she just kind of ran with it.\"\n\nShe organized water bottle drives and spread the word about what was happening. Today, Copeny is still focused on bringing attention to Flint \u2014 pipes have been replaced and while officials say the water is safe, many residents aren't convinced; in fact, Copeny's family still drinks only bottled water. But she has also shifted her attention to other causes. This summer, she teamed up with Kidbox to help distribute boxes of clothes and school supplies to kids in need. And she has her eye on politics, too. She has a proposition for all 2020 contenders.\n\n\"I am calling on all the presidential candidates to do a town hall with the youth, where kids are moderating and asking the questions about what is most important,\" she said.\n\nAnd in 2044, Copeny already plans to run for the Oval Office herself. She'll be 36 years old.\n\n\"If she keeps up the momentum, I could see it happening,\" Brezzell said of her daughter's future potential presidential run. \"I'm sure she'll start one place and work her way up.\"\n\nMari Copeny speaks onstage during the 11th Annual Shorty Awards on May 5 in New York City.

While the world knows Copeny as a powerful young activist, her classmates know her as, well, a kid. She likes anime and video games, and says it feels \"weird\" that people consider her an activist. \"I'm just a kid from Flint,\" she said.\n\nShe likes the perks, though \u2014 like meeting some of her favorite celebrities and introducing them to her peers.\n\n\"I brought Elon Musk to my school,\" she said. \"Everyone was so hyped.\"\n\nCopeny knows that even as a kid, she has a powerful voice.\n\nAnd she hopes other young girls know it, too.\n\n\"My advice to girls is to always believe in yourself and in the work that you are doing, even if the work is hard and it sometimes feels impossible,\" she said. \"You can do it. You can change the world right now. You don't have to wait until you grow up.\"", "description": "Activist Mari Copeny, better known as Little Miss Flint, wrote a letter to then President Barack Obama about the water crisis in 2016.
