For the week, the index was down 1%, its worst weekly performance in 17 weeks.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in an 82% chance of a rate cut at the Oct. 30 meeting, Refinitiv data show.\n\nThe pound was 0.45% higher against the dollar at $1.2946 on Friday, even as doubts remained about whether the proposed Brexit deal will get through the British parliament in Saturday's vote.\n\nThe yuan held steady against the dollar after data showed China's economy grew at the slowest pace in more than 27 years in the third quarter, owing to the trade war with the United States and weak factory production.
