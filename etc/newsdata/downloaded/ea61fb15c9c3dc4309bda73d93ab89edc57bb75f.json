Giuliani in the complaint against President Trump, with most of the information coming from Mr. Giuliani\u2019s own public statements and news reports.\n\nWhistleblower complaints typically contain confirmed inside information not known to investigators until they are tipped off.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, who is a private citizen, congressional Democrats could have gathered most of the whistleblower\u2019s tidbits about Mr. Giuliani from the internet.\n\nNonetheless, the complaint has prompted House Democrats to put the former New York mayor under investigation.\n\nOther Giuliani allegations are based on unnamed sources in a style similar to that of the discredited Democratic Party-financed dossier used in 2017 by the FBI to try to bring down Mr. Trump. It quoted unknown Kremlin sources and it was eventually debunked.\n\n\u201cIt is quite dumbfounding that an intelligence community whistleblower is targeting Giuliani, someone who certainly does not have a security clearance,\u201d Brett L. Tolman, a Republican-aligned former U.S. attorney for Utah, told The Washington Times. \u201cThe credibility of the whistleblower is further brought into question when it is apparent that they were not present for any of the alleged misconduct of Giuliani.\u201d\n\nFor months, Mr. Giuliani has been investigating how the Ukrainian government interfered in the 2016 election by cooperating with the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. He has traveled to Ukraine and Europe for interviews, and talked about it with the press.\n\nThe anti-Trump whistleblower disapproves. The nine-page complaint refers to Mr. Giuliani 30 times in a footnoted narrative that implies Mr. Giuliani did something wrong.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort,\u201d the whistleblower wrote in his Aug. 12 complaint to the Senate and House intelligence committees.\n\nA Justice Department memo described the whistleblower as a political partisan.\n\nIntelligence community guidelines make clear that whistleblowers should not use the complaint process because they disagree with policy. The complaint form \u201cis designed for reporting wrongdoing and not personal grievances, policy disputes or management disagreements,\u201d the guidance says.\n\nJay Sekulow, who is on the president\u2019s legal team, told The Washington Times: \u201cRudy was representing his client. Appropriate and ethical.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General, which receives and assesses whistleblower complaints, states on its website that wrongdoing must have occurred \u201cwithin\u201d the community to qualify as an \u201curgent concern.\u201d Once designated, a complaint automatically goes to the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\n\u201cLawful whistleblowing provides information about wrongdoing within the IC to those who can take action,\u201d the policy states.\n\nMr. Giuliani is not a government employee. He is Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney. He portrays himself as a whistleblower gathering facts on Ukrainian corruption and election interference.\n\nSidney Powell is a defense attorney for retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, briefly Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser. She is, in a sense, on a Giuliani-type mission. She has filed motions in U.S. District Court to force federal prosecutors to disclose more documents on how they conducted the nearly three-year Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nOn the whistleblower complaint, Ms. Powell said: \u201cI have little doubt it was all orchestrated and contrived. Stunning things people are doing now.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m the messenger\u2019\n\nMr. Giuliani has been open about his work, depicting it as an anti-corruption investigation in a country that a receives millions of dollars in U.S. aid and is riddled with thieves and bribe-takers.\n\nHe also has looked into Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son\u2019s lucrative appointment to a Ukrainian natural gas firm\u2019s board of directors in 2014. At the time, Mr. Biden was President Obama\u2019s point man on Ukraine.\n\nDuring a 30-minute phone call in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Trump asked him to talk to Attorney General William Barr about the Bidens. That request was contained in a call transcript as well as the whistleblower complaint. The whistleblower described Mr. Trump\u2019s request as \u201cpressured.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower narrative is filled with references to a public Mr. Giuliani. The complainant cites the same liberal press that promoted a Trump-Russia election conspiracy that special counsel Robert Mueller didn\u2019t find.\n\nSome examples of the whistleblower\u2019s dossier-style writing:\n\n\u2022 \u201cIt was also publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani had met on at least two occasions with Mr. Lutsenko: once in New York in late January and again in Warsaw in mid-February. In addition, it was publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\n\u201cShokin\u201d is Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor who was fired at Mr. Biden\u2019s request. \u201cLutsenko\u201d is Yuriy Lutsenko, also a former prosecutor.\n\n\u2022 \u201cOn 9 May, The New York Times reported that Mr. Giuliani planned to travel to Ukraine to press the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations that would help the President in his 2020 reelection bid.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cOn 21 June, Mr. Giuliani tweeted: \u2018New Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 and alleged Biden bribery of Poroshenko. Time for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Clinton people.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPoroshenko\u201d is former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who was defeated by Mr. Zelensky.\n\nThe intelligence inspector general stated there is \u201csome indication of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\u201d according to a Department of Justice memo.\n\nThe whistleblower also relies on hearsay when writing about Mr. Giuliani.\n\nFor example, he writes: \u201cI heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decision making processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kiev and the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani defends his work for the president. He criticizes the New York Times, The Washington Post and other liberal outlets for years of protecting Mr. Biden and not investigating anything he does.\n\n\u201cWP, NBC, and CNN are going after me because I\u2019m the messenger, and covering up the message, Dem corruption,\u201d Mr. Giuliani tweeted. \u201cMeanwhile, they have yet to ask Biden difficult questions because he is protected and immune like the Clintons and crooked Clinton Foundation!\u201d\n\nAlthough regulations by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence say that \u201curgent concern\u201d whistleblower complaints must involve misconduct within the intelligence community, Inspector General Michael K. Atkinson approved the anti-Trump complaint with that designation.\n\nHe did this because the director of national intelligence is involved in countering election interference and the whistleblower argued that Mr. Trump was asking Ukraine to meddle.\n\nA Justice Department Sept. 24 opinion from its Office of Legal Counsel disagreed with Mr. Atkinson.\n\n\u201cThe complaint does not arise in connection with the operation of any U.S. government intelligence activity, and the alleged misconduct does not involve any member of the intelligence community,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cRather, the complaint arises out of a confidential diplomatic communication between the President and a foreign leader that the intelligence-community complainant received secondhand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ICIG\u2019s reporting responsibilities, however, do not concern officials outside the intelligence community, let alone the President,\u201d the legal counsel said.\n\nThe opinion said the IG should have forwarded the complaint to the Justice Department, which would decide whether to open a criminal investigation.\n\nThe day after the opinion was written, the Trump administration relented. The administration publicly released the complaint and the call transcript.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
