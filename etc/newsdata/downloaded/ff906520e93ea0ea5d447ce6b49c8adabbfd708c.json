By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity.\n\nPrincess Diana visited the minefields in Angola 22 years before her son followed in her footsteps (Picture: PA)\n\nPrince Harry urged \u2018everyone\u2019 to \u2018commit fully\u2019 to clearing Angola of mines during his tour of southern Africa (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018Additionally, we can protect the diverse and unique wildlife that relies on the beautiful Kuito river that I slept beside last night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That river and those wildlife are your natural assets and, if looked after, will bring you unlimited opportunities in the conservation-led economy.\n\n\u2018It is fitting that this project starts in Dirico, at the convergence of the two rivers that flow from Angola\u2019s islands down to the Okavango Delta.\n\n\u2018These two rivers provide water and life to over a million people downstream and an essential and incredibly delicate habitat for an abundance of wildlife.\n\n\u2018Just as these rivers extend for miles, so must this project extend far beyond Dirico.\n\n\u2018Outside the national parks, large parts of this crucial watershed also need to be cleared of land mines.\n\n\u2018Clearing the full watershed will take an international effort. Everyone who recognises the priceless importance of safeguarding Africa\u2019s most intact natural landscape should commit fully to this mission.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
