The first nine months of his life were spent in the NICU at Akron Children's Hospital, after Brittany and her husband Steve were told their son had \u201clittle to no chance of surviving birth.\u201d Then, just two weeks into his life, Brantley faced another horrifying ordeal: he had necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious bowel infection affecting mostly premature infants, and had to undergo emergency surgery; doctors said he had just a 50 percent chance of surviving.\n\n\"Our family handles these situations by leaning on each other and turning to God. We give it all to God, always,\" Brittany tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \"We have an amazing support system and people who are always willing to step in and help us. People tell us all the time that we are strong for dealing with everything we go through, but to be honest, we\u2019re just doing what we need to do for our family.\n\nBrantley's first Halloween was spent in the NICU; when his second came around, his family was too nervous about participating.\n\n\"It\u2019s scary when you have a child with a compromised immune system, because this time of year sickness is floating all around,\u201d Brittany explains. \u201cBrantley was still requiring oxygen on a daily basis at that point, so we knew his lungs just were not strong enough to fight anything off.\u201d\n\nIn addition to raising Brantley and dealing with his ongoing medical struggles, Brittany and Steve are parents to a 10-year-old son, Jacob, and an 8-year-old daughter, Maddie; further, Brittany is pregnant with a fourth child, a daughter, who will soon make Brantley a big brother.\n\nThe Morse family aims to get through any hardships they face by always looking for the positive \u2014 which explains their joyous approach to Halloween this year.\n\nBrittany says she knew that she wanted to incorporate her son's medical equipment into his costume, but wasn't sure how. So, she turned to Facebook, where many offered the suggestion of Carl from Up.\n\nIt made sense to her, as Brantley already had the glasses and the walker; after much searching, she was able to find the perfect small bowtie and cardigan. Then, with a couple of balloons tied to his walker, the ensemble was complete.\n\nBrantley made his debut in the adorable costume at a fall festival last weekend, and the photo evidence has taken the internet by storm. Brantley even made the evening news.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think I have fully processed how viral Brantley\u2019s story has gone yet,\" Brittany says. \"My husband and I have always tried to be open about our journey with Brantley, the good and the bad, in hopes that we can help someone else get through a hard time, or be able to relate. So to see Brantley\u2019s story being shared nationwide, and to be contacted by so many news channels and people wanting to learn more, honestly means the world.\"\n\nSince sharing the photos, the family has received many messages from complete strangers stating that Brantley had given them hope, restored their faith, or even put a smile on their face.\n\n\"That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Brittany says. \u201cWe know others can relate, and we want them to know they\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A 2-year-old with cerebral palsy took the internet by storm after his 'Up'-inspired costume was shared to Facebook.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nesy5Rmy5C36YCEAMcV3Og--~B/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/video/video.cbsnewsvideos.com/b868ea0b5a882a85f390c21eec138eba", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
