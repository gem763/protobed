But for the people out there around the track, it is not nice to be sitting there with rain going sideways.\u201d\n\nThe blank Saturday will be a huge disappointment to thousands of fanatical supporters at one of the best-attended races on the circuit.", "description": "Suzuka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 The Japanese Grand Prix\u2019s entire Saturday track programme, including qualifying, has been cancelled as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/357ed9_qualifying-year-grand-prix-suzuka-has-postponed-sunday-morning-huge-typhoon-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
