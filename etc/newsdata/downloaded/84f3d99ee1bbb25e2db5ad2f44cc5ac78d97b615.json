The judge will give his reasons on Tuesday.\n\nCarrie Lam issues new law banning masks, but protesters vow to defy ban\n\nBut Lam said the judicial challenge filed by the lawmakers must be heard by the end of October, an accelerated process the legislators called \u201ca rare move\u201d. The government had initially suggested the hearing take place a year from now.\n\n\u201cObviously the court also sees that this case raises extremely important constitutional issues,\u201d said Dennis Kwok Wing-hang, a lawmaker for the legal functional constituency who led the judicial challenge.\n\nWhile Kwok called it a battle between \u201cauthoritarianism and the rule of law\u201d, another lawmaker, Claudia Mo Man-ching, said it was \u201cthe very last constitutional fight on our part in the name of law\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers took the government to court on Sunday morning, arguing that the chief executive\u2019s move was unconstitutional.\n\nThey accused her of bypassing the legislature when she imposed the ban on wearing masks at public assemblies through a colonial law that preceded the city\u2019s constitution and human rights law.\n\nThe move \u201csubverts the constitutional order\u201d, their barrister Gladys Li SC said in court.\n\nDefying mask ban, tens of thousands of Hongkongers protest over the weekened\n\nLi argued the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO), passed in 1922, gave the city\u2019s leader \u201coverwhelming power\u201d. But since then, the city\u2019s mini-constitution Basic Law and Bill of Rights came in to place.\n\nShe said the Basic Law clearly stated Legco was responsible for making law, not the government as the executive branch. The court in Hong Kong had established the principle of separation of power over the years, she added.\n\nLi warned one consequence of Lam\u2019s sweeping power under the ERO was that it allowed the chief executive to enact the extradition bill \u2013 the controversial legislation that sparked months of anti-government protests \u2013 any time she wished.\n\nPro-democracy lawmakers (from left to right) Dr Kwok Ka-ki, Claudia Mo, Kenneth Leung, Leung Yiu-chung, Dennis Kwok, Tanya Chan, and Charles Peter Mok, filed an urgent application for a temporary suspension on the anti-mask law.

Both were rejected.\n\nTwo activists, including ousted lawmaker \u201cLong Hair\u201d Leung Kwok-hung, failed with the first attempt which was made hours before the restriction came into force at 12.01am on Saturday.", "description": "Pro-democracy legislators are calling the legal action 'the last battle between authoritarianism and the rule of law'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/2325a996-e7f4-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires085127.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
