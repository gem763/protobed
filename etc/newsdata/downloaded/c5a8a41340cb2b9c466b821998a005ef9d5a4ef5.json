To actually come out with it and go into huge detail about all those things, to be honest, is a bit beneath me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have maybe a wider sexual taste than most people, but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m going to go.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018I couldn\u2019t fall in love with a man the way I could with a girl.\u2019\n\nTalking about his almost wife, the icon continued: \u2018Our love affair ended in tears, but a deep bond grew out of it, and that\u2019s something nobody can take away from us.\n\nMary has often praised Freddie long after his tragic death (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s unreachable. People always ask me about sexuality and all those things, right from the early days, but I couldn\u2019t fall in love with a man the same way as I have with Mary.\u2019\n\nHe concluded: \u2018All my lovers asked me why they couldn\u2019t replace Mary, but it\u2019s simply impossible.\u2019\n\nThe pair first met in 1969 when Mary was 19-years-old and Freddie was 24.\n\nThe now 68-year-old lives a quiet life in her London home, which was left to her by the great popstar.\n\nAnd it seems their love for one another was mutual, as Mary has often praised Freddie following his tragic death.\n\nShe once said: \u2018I lost my family, really, when Freddie died. He was everything to me, apart from my sons. He was like no one I had met before.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
