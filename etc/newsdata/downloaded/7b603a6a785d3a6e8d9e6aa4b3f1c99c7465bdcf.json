Roger Goodell gives vague message on Antonio Brown: 'We'll let you know'", "language": "en", "text": "If Antonio Brown was hoping for some sign that his days under NFL investigation were coming to an end, he was undoubtedly disappointed by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIn his first public comments regarding the league\u2019s investigation of sexual misconduct allegations against Brown, Goodell gave no timeline for a conclusion. Instead, Goodell delivered an opaque status update and something along the lines of an I don\u2019t know anything shrug.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working at that,\u201d Goodell said from the league\u2019s fall meetings in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \u201cI will probably be getting an update when I get back to New York, but our folks have been working diligently on that, going through materials. There\u2019s a lot of material to go through. When we reach a conclusion, we\u2019ll obviously let you know.\u201d\n\nAntonio Brown is still under league investigation for alleged sexual misconduct. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHowever NFL teams view Goodell\u2019s words, his open-ended answer will likely only further the notion that Brown seemed to suggest with an Oct. 15 tweet that read \u201cFree AB\u201d. While there\u2019s no implication from that message, it\u2019s believed to dovetail with what sources close to Brown have been privately suggesting: That the NFL is purposely dragging its feet on an investigation to strand Brown on a free-agent desert island. It\u2019s a sort of purgatory that was essentially created on Sept. 20, when the NFL released a statement warning that if Brown were to be signed by a team, his eligibility to be placed on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list \u201cmay become appropriate at any time depending on the status of the investigation.\u201d A stay on the exempt list would mean that a team could sign Brown and have to pay him, but not be allowed to play him in a game while he was still on the list. The statement further warned: \u201c[Brown] may also be subject to discipline if the investigation finds that he has violated the law or league policies.\u201d\n\n\n\nMultiple team officials who spoke with Yahoo Sports characterized that message as a warning shot from the league to essentially stay away from Brown.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a powerful suggestion, particularly when it\u2019s coming on top of all of Brown\u2019s other issues. Lest anyone have lost track of it all, Brown has engaged in or is being engaged by: a federal civil lawsuit alleging rape and sexual assault; a bizarre civil suit involving alleged property destruction; multiple grievances against his past two teams, the Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots; a reported vaguely threatening text-messaging incident toward a woman who spoke about Brown in a Sports Illustrated story; and of course, a stream of high-profile social media posts that have only served to turn up the volume on the drama around him.\n\n\n\nAbsorb all of that and then consider what Goodell said from the fall meetings and it appears unlikely he\u2019ll be signing anywhere until the league\u2019s investigators reach some kind of resolution. To teams that have had players under the league\u2019s nebulous investigation, Goodell\u2019s non-answer response is somewhat reminiscent of the long, drawn-out Ezekiel Elliott investigation, which went on for over one year before the NFL suspended the Dallas Cowboys running back. A length of time that included repeated messages from the league to the Cowboys that investigators were \u201cworking diligently\u201d on the case. If anything, that kind of phrasing involving Brown is another red flag that lets teams know he is under the cloud of an investigation that is not going away until the league announces some kind of sanctions or that it has concluded its work. Making matters more complicated for Brown, he doesn't have a team owner like Jerry Jones to lean on the league to wrap up the work in an expedited manner.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s part of why Goodell can say \u201cwe\u2019ll obviously let you know\u201d about the status of Brown and not have anyone up in arms. There\u2019s little doubt that he wasn\u2019t just responding to reporters about Brown\u2019s status \u2014 he was likely responding to Brown, too.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, Antonio Brown doesn\u2019t seem to be free of the NFL\u2019s probe. And that may not change anytime soon.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "In his first public comments regarding the NFL's probe of sexual misconduct allegations against Brown, Goodell gave no timeline for a conclusion", "authors": ["Charles Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TJ.fODzIGXlQeNNjjSbnfg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5pHHTzdvy0RErPa.WYbX1Q--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7343c990-f090-11e9-bacc-18586249099f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
