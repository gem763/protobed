The draft bill, called the \u2018\u2018Stablecoins are Securities Act of 2019,\u201d seeks to regulate stablecoins under the Securities Act of 1933. This entails \u201camending statutory definitions of the term security\u201d to include the term \u201cmanaged stablecoins.\u201d\n\nThe proposed bill seems to be directed at Facebook\u2019s Libra stablecoin, which is planned to launch in 2020. Lawmakers across the globe weigh in on the discussion in regards to stablecoins, such as Libra, and its perceived threat to the global financial system.\n\nCointelegraph reported today that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, scheduled to testify before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, plans to say that Libra will not launch anywhere in the world until U.S. regulators approve it.\n\nLibra around the world\n\nRecently, the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors stated that they would not allow any global stablecoin to launch without adequately addressing the related challenges and risks.\n\nSimilarly, the global monetary watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), voiced its concerns over Facebook\u2019s Libra and other stablecoins, claiming that mass adoption of such currencies could hinder efforts to detect and stamp out money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nRegulating Libra as a security\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph on Friday, Oct. 18, U.S. Representative Warren Davidson, known for his role in authoring the Token Taxonomy Act, said that Libra is ultimately classified as a security and therefore falls under the purview of the SEC.\n\nEchoing today\u2019s draft bill\u2019s concern with a stablecoin being managed by a company, Davidson said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with stablecoins. It has to do with whether there\u2019s a central authority that can alter it.\u201d He added:", "description": "A draft bill has surfaced in U.S. Congress that claims that all managed stablecoins must be seen as investment contracts and therefore as securities", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8wMGRmOTJkY2QwZDRmMTc5ZGViNmM3Nzg0MWMzY2VjNy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
