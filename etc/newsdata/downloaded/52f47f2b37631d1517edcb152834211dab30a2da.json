Now they don't want the second whistleblower,\u201d Trump said Monday to media about the allegations.\n\nVindman also is expected to say that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, made political demands of the Ukrainians during a July 10 visit to Washington,\u201cFollowing the debriefing meeting, I reported my concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.

In a letter sent to Democratic House lawmakers, Pelosi, D-Calif., said the resolution \"affirms the ongoing, existing investigation\" and \"establishes the procedure\" for future investigative steps.\n\nPelosi on Sept. 24 announced the formalization of the Trump impeachment inquiry, saying at the time that \"the president must be held accountable\" for his \"betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nVindman also is expected to tell lawmakers at his Tuesday morning closed-door deposition about his background and ideology: \u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics.\u201d\n\nHis remarks continued: \u201cFor over 20 years as an active-duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations.\u201d\n\nFox News' Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.", "description": "As part of the House\u2019s\u00a0impeachment inquiry,\u00a0Lt.
