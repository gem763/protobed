However, some Chinese, particularly those with lower education levels, continue to be drawn to Europe and North America by the promise of much higher wages than they can earn at home, despite the considerable risks involved.\n\nParts of China, especially the southeastern province of Fujian, have long histories of sending migrants abroad.\n\nThe issue is a difficult one to confront for China's ruling Communist Party, which is intensely sensitive about China's international image and has staked much of its legitimacy to rule on improving living standards for the bulk of China's 1.4 billion people.\n\nIn an editorial Friday, the party newspaper Global Times said authorities in Britain and elsewhere hadn't done enough to crack down on people smuggling.\n\n\"Such a serious humanitarian disaster occurred under the eyes of the British and Europeans,\" the newspaper said. \"Britain and the related European countries have not met their responsibility for protecting these people from dying in such a manner.\"", "description": "\"But I think that no matter where these victims come from, this is a great tragedy which drew the attention of the international community to the issue of illegal immigration.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/truck-UK-AP-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
