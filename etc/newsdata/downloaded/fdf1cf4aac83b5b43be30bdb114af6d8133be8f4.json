The main opposition Social Democratic Party came second with almost 28%.\n\nThe Socialists, however, are 10 seats shy of a majority in the 230-seat parliament. To ensure its legislation is approved, the government will need support from other parties.\n\nThe obvious candidates for an alliance are the radical Left Bloc, which snared 19 seats, and the Communist Party, which got 12.\n\nThose two parties allied with the Socialists during the four-year term that has just ended.\n\nPortuguese Prime Minister and Socialist Party leader Antonio Costa raises his fist while addressing supporters following the announcement of election results in Lisbon Sunday night, Oct. 6, 2019.
