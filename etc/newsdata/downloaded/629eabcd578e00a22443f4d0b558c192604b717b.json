He was 62.\n\nMost recently Hurd was co-CEO at Oracle with Safra Catz where he focused on sales, marketing and press and investor relations, while she ran finances and legal matters. Oracle announced on Sept. 11 that Hurd had begun a leave of absence for unspecified health-related reasons and that Catz and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison would assume his responsibilities during his leave. The company didn\u2019t disclose a cause of death Friday.\n\n\u201cIt is with a profound sense of sadness and loss that I tell everyone here at Oracle that Mark Hurd passed away early this morning,\u201d Ellison wrote in an online post. \u201cMark was my close and irreplaceable friend, and trusted colleague. Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle.\u201d\n\nHurd began his career in 1980 as a salesman for National Cash Register Corp. (now NCR), before rising in the ranks to the CEO post. In 2005, he was hired away as CEO by Hewlett-Packard Co., then the world\u2019s biggest personal-computer maker. Hurd joined Oracle as a co-president in 2010, after resigning from HP following a sexual-harassment probe. While an internal investigation didn\u2019t find a violation of the company\u2019s sexual-harassment policy, it concluded that he violated company standards by filing inaccurate expense reports to conceal a personal relationship with a contractor.\n\nDuring his Oracle tenure, Hurd produced solid revenue and profits as the Redwood City, California-based company\u2019s stock price hit a historic high in 2019. He was also a key driver in Oracle\u2019s turn from an old model of licensing software toward the use of cloud computing, a burgeoning business dominated by rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\nWhen he hired Hurd, Ellison said, \u201cThere is no executive in the IT world with more relevant experience than Mark.\u201d Ellison described Hurd\u2019s dismissal by HP as the \u201cworst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs.\u201d\n\nTransformed Salesforce\n\nHurd reshaped Oracle\u2019s salesforce. Beginning in 2013, he implemented a \u201cspecialist\u201d model that made each member an expert in a single product category. In that year alone, he hired more than 4,000 people to implement his idea.\n\nHe also created the \u201cClass of\u201d program that was designed to inject a startup feel into Oracle. College graduates were hired for a dedicated program that prepared them to become Oracle\u2019s future sales leaders.\n\nIn 2014, Hurd and Catz were named co-CEOs, while Ellison continued to serve as chairman of the board, orchestrate management changes and develop products as chief technology officer.\n\nHurd was regarded as the most media-friendly of the trio, frequently serving as the public face of the company to outline its goals. At the time Hurd and Catz were named CEOs, Oracle\u2019s central business was selling software designed to run on gear owned by the customer and charging a license fee. Hurd was among those inside Oracle who saw the company\u2019s future in cloud computing \u2014 which would let customers rent software and run their data on servers owned by vendors such as Oracle. He predicted in 2015 that by 2025 all enterprise data would be stored in the cloud and that 100 per cent of software development and testing would run through it.\n\nGrowth Strategy\n\nHurd led the charge to make Oracle one of the dominant cloud players, investing heavily in research and development and acquisitions, such as the US$9.3-billion purchase of NetSuite Inc., sometimes called the first cloud company, in 2016. Oracle also bought Eloqua Inc., a marketing software company, and Taleo Corp., which makes talent-management.\n\nHe secured significant deals with AT&T Inc., Bank of America Corp., and Qantas Airlines to transfer their existing databases to the cloud through Oracle. By late 2019, Oracle served more than 420,000 customers in 195 countries and territories, he said.\n\nHurd had gone on a similar acquisition binge at HP, managing about US$24 billion in deals, including buying Electronic Data Systems (EDS), as part of a larger plan to diversify the computer maker.\n\nHe was also a drastic cost cutter who was responsible for firing thousands of workers when he first took over as HP\u2019s CEO and laying off thousands more after the $13.9 billion purchase in 2008 of a struggling EDS, a move many investors disliked.\n\nStill, under Hurd\u2019s tenure, HP increased profits for 22 straight quarters, while its revenue rose about 60 per cent and its stock price doubled, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He also helped HP surpass International Business Machines Corp. as the largest computer maker by sales.\n\nThere were some dark moments at HP too. In 2006, it was disclosed that Hurd had helped launch an investigation into internal leaks from the company\u2019s board. Outside security consultants conducted surveillance on a journalist and HP board member, and used a subterfuge to acquire phone and fax records for HP employees, board members and journalists. The California attorney general\u2019s office opened a criminal probe into possible privacy violations, and HP\u2019s chairwoman at the time, Patricia Dunn, resigned her post when the scandal broke.\n\nFor his part, Hurd defended the need to investigate company leakers, but claimed he didn\u2019t know about the investigators\u2019 tawdry tactics because he\u2019d ducked out of a briefing on the investigation and, several months later, ignored a verbal and written summary of the leak probe.\n\nAfter Hurd was ousted following the sexual harassment probe in 2010, HP discontinued making smartphones and its tablet computer. Eventually it split into two companies, one focused on personal computers and printers and the other on software and services.\n\nTop CEO\n\nDespite navigating several scandals, Hurd was lauded by the industry. In 2007, he was named one of Fortune magazine\u2019s 25 most powerful business leaders. In 2008, the San Francisco Chronicle named Hurd CEO of the Year.\n\n\u201cSaddened by the loss of Mark Hurd,\u201d wrote Bill McDermott, who stepped down as CEO of SAP SE this month, on Twitter. \u201cHe was a self-made success in the industry & presided over mega accomplishments. While we competed vigorously in the market, we enjoyed professional respect. My heartfelt prayers are with Mark\u2019s family on this solemn day.\u201d\n\nMark Vincent Hurd was born on Jan. 1, 1957, in New York and lived on the affluent Upper East Side of Manhattan. His Yale-educated father was a financier who moved the family to Miami while Hurd was in high school. His mother was a debutante.\n\nHurd received a tennis scholarship to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in 1979.\n\nHe was hired in 1980 as a junior sales person by National Cash Register in San Antonio. He eventually became president, chief operating officer and CEO of the maker of automatic teller machines and cash registers.\n\nBased on his NCR record, HP hired him in 2005 as its CEO and added the chairman title the following year.\n\n\u201cMark just blew everybody else out of the water,\u201d said Tom Perkins, a former HP executive who interviewed Hurd for the CEO job.\n\nHurd served on a number of corporate boards and was a Baylor University trustee since 2014.\n\nHe was married to the former Paula Kalupa in 1990. They had two daughters, Kathryn and Kelly.\n\n\u2013With assistance from Nico Grant and Peter Waldman.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Oracle announced last month that Hurd would be taking a medical leave but did not give any other details", "authors": ["Patrick Oster", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mark-hurd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
