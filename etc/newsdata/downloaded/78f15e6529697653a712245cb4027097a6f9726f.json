The funding will be paid out pending an agreement with the European Commission.\n\nThomas Cook Germany is also based in Hesse and state premier Volker Bouffier said it was in principle willing to step in to help that company too.\n\nIt said that it had long been burdened by the weak Thomas Cook business in Great Britain and by Brexit.\n\nHow are European tourists affected?\n\nA total of 600,00 holidaymakers have been caught up in the collapse of the UK company. Many have travelled from the UK but Thomas Cook's empire stretches across Europe and tens of thousands have travelled with its subsidiaries.\n\nUnder EU package holiday rules, holidaymakers are protected financially from a company's insolvency as well as having the right to repatriation.\n\nThe UK's Civil Aviation Authority has had the task of bringing back more than 150,000 holidaymakers. It repatriated more than 14,000 passengers on Tuesday and was expecting to bring back another 16,500 on Wednesday.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A passenger raises funds for Thomas Cook staff on a flight from Turkey\n\nThousands of Dutch, Belgian and Polish tourists are still abroad, but the biggest group affected outside the UK is from Germany.

A thousand people are employed by the company near Frankfurt.\n\nIt said it was talking to the German foreign ministry as well as the travel bankruptcy insurer, Zurich, about repatriating customers. Like Condor, it has asked the Hesse state government and the federal government for a bridging loan.\n\nThomas Cook's Polish subsidiary, Neckermann Polska, has suspended its activities and said it will also file for bankruptcy.\n\nWhy has Germany's Thomas Cook filed for bankruptcy?\n\nThe German subsidiary believes its brands have a future and is in negotiations with investors and hotel operators to continue in business.\n\nThomas Cook GmbH said it had been forced to seek insolvency to extricate itself from its (UK) parent company's \"financial tie-ups and related liabilities\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Former Thomas Cook pilot explains how he was told he would lose his job\n\n\"We owe this to our long-standing customers, committed employees and other partners who have supported us so much over the years and in the last difficult weeks,\" said chief executive Stefanie Berk.\n\nFounded in 1841, parent company Thomas Cook filed for bankruptcy after failing to secure emergency funding of \u00a3200m from the UK government.\n\nIn the UK, anyone who has bought a package holiday covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol) will have the cost refunded.\n\nHowever, some customers whose future holidays have been cancelled have seen the price of replacement deals spiral.\n\nHow have businesses around the world been affected?\n\nThere is concern in countries such as Egypt and Greece that local businesses could be financially impacted by loss of tourism.", "description": "After the UK parent company's collapse, the German subsidiary tries to save its national brands.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B26B/production/_108957654_056739254-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
