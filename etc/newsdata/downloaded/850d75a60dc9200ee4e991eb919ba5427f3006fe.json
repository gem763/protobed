It affects all kinds of things, your whole life in lots of different ways.\n\n'It would vary day to day - I was sleeping really badly, and then I became anxious about bed time. I was irritable.'\n\nShe went on: 'Everything was dry - my hair, nails and skin were all suffering. And all the tiny things were affecting my mental health.'\n\nGemma credited the supplement Lyma with strengthening her nails, hair, skin as well as helping her sleep and immune system\n\nGemma said she struggled to feel like herself, admitting: 'I felt like life was a struggle, like it was a huge effort to do anything. I felt all out of sync, dull, flat and emotionless.'\n\nThe mother-of-three, who lives with her husband and children, said she found herself in 'the centre of all the arguments.'\n\nShe said it came to a head after her husband asked her: 'Why is it always you?'\n\nGemma's 'first port of call' was her GP - but she was left disappointed with his reaction to her concerns.\n\nThe mother-of-three turned to the 'super supplement' after a friend recommended it - and felt it improved her skin, nails and hair almost immediately (pictured, after taking Lyma earlier this year)\n\nGemma revealed: 'My GP wasn't very receptive or sympathetic - he was sort of like 'Well get on with it'. He offered me HRT or nothing.'\n\nA study finds Hormone Replacement Therapy increases risk of breast cancer HRT was back in the spotlight in September after an Oxford study found it raised the risk of breast cancer by a third. Researchers said women aged 50 to 69 were 32 per cent more likely to get the disease if they had taken the most common form of the hormone replacement therapy for at least five years. The danger was twice as high for patients on the treatment for a decade. The Oxford team said however that the overall risk was still small \u2013 and doctors said the benefits often outweighed the risks.\n\nBut as her mother had suffered from breast cancer, she was warned that she would have an increased risk of developing the disease while on the therapy.\n\nThinking that a female GP might be more understanding, Gemma booked another appointment.\n\nBut she revealed: 'She was more sympathetic, she still couldn't offer much though.\n\n'I just thought 'What else can I do?' and decided to ride out the storm.'\n\nAfter a year, Gemma confided in a friend that she was struggling to cope, and she was recommended a 'super supplement' called Lyma.\n\nLyma, which costs \u00a3149 per month, promises to smoothe skin by 80 per cent, strengthen hair by 47 per cent and nails by 88 per cent, improve sleep and brain energy, maximise immunity and reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nThe brainchild of celebrity personal trainer Russell Bateman, its clients include actress Liv Tyler, singer Ellie Goulding and several Victoria's Secret models.\n\nGemma said she spoke to her husband to persuade him to allow the supplement into their monthly outgoing.\n\nGemma said she felt she had her 'bounce back' within a week of taking the supplement, and has noticed an improvement in her nails, hair and skin\n\nAfter taking the tablets twice in the morning and twice in the evening for a week, the mother-of-three said her mood was almost immediately lifted.\n\nShe said: 'I felt like within a week of taking it that I had got my bounce back.'\n\nThe mother-of-three said she took the supplement for about a month before noticing her nails, hair and skin had also improved.\n\nShe said: 'It also helped with my sleep pattern, I wasn't feeling so anxious at night, and I had a better immune system.'\n\nThe mother-of-three said she now takes four Lyma tablets a day in order to maintain her health and wellbeing\n\nShe added: 'The best effects have been on my joints and body - I feel much lighter and more supple.'\n\nGemma, who runs regularly, said she takes part in 5km long cancer runs yearly - and revealed after taking the supplement she'd beaten her personal best by 2 minutes.\n\nShe said that even her colleagues at work had noted a huge difference, saying: 'I had more energy than girls half my age.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Gemma Asim, 52, from London, said her menopausal symptoms left her feeling 'flat' and 'exhausted', until she started a supplement containing vitamin D and keratin.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19496162-0-image-a-46_1570634549696.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
