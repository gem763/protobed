It illustrates the downside of a founder personality cult that, when it goes wrong, can risk the whole enterprise.\n\nAnd it serves as a warning to the overly optimistic assumptions of investor exits that still prevail in both private equity and venture capital.\n\n...the growing proliferation of what seems to be highly liquid investment instruments on inherently illiquid asset classes ...\n\nNone of these issues will come as a huge surprise for long-term observers of these private markets. But they have yet to sufficiently inform, let alone influence, what has been a huge increase in broader investor interest in an asset class that, almost by definition, is not built to deal quickly and efficiently with massive inflows without a significant increase in already notable investment and operational risks.\n\nWeWork also speaks - or should speak - to risks that go beyond venture capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacing ultra-low and in some cases negative yields because of central banks' prolonged reliance on unconventional policies, investors have been forced well beyond their natural habitat in search of higher returns. This first played out in the acceptance of diminished quality for several investment strategies and in the willingness of investors to underwrite greater potential market volatility and defaults.\n\nWith demand shrinking traditional risk premiums, investors were forced to also sacrifice more liquidity. It's a phenomenon that has played out not just directly but also through the growing proliferation of what seems to be highly liquid investment instruments on inherently illiquid asset classes, like some ETFs and passive products, which too many investors regard as offering immediate liquidity at reasonable bid-offer spreads.\n\nThe WeWork saga is far from over, and it will undoubtedly be the subject of several business school cases. But already its early lessons extend well beyond the company and its investor base, offering a cautionary tale for less-informed investors who might be lured down a similar path.\n\nMohamed A.
