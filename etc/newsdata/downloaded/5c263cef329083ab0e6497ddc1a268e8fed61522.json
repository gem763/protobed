Earlier this summer, a few weeks before her second child was born, Knightley, 34, sat down and talked exclusively to the Observer about why she took the part, and why she felt she believed that the film was coming out at a timely moment.\n\nDid you spend much time with Katharine to prepare for the part?\n\nNot a huge amount. I had lunch with her, and she came to the set once. I really liked her. Gavin Hood, the director, had said he didn\u2019t want a characterisation of her. I mean, I don\u2019t look anything like her. She has an interesting accent because she was brought up in Taiwan. I really wanted to do that, but Gavin wouldn\u2019t let me. I\u2019m not a journalist, of course, so this was the first time I had asked anyone any questions that they legally could not answer. What is amazing about Katharine is that her point of view is so utterly clear. As far as playing her, that point of view had to come across. This is a story told through her eyes.\n\nWas it a story you were aware of?\n\nNo. It was only a week before the war started, wasn\u2019t it? I guess the avalanche of the invasion itself overwhelmed it. I was about 18 at the time. I thought I was engaged. I really remember the run-up to that conflict, but I didn\u2019t remember this.\n\nI was in America shooting Pirates of the Caribbean and feeling utterly stupid that I was in a pirate costume and all my mates were on an anti-war march\n\nIt\u2019s extraordinary to think that it was 16 years ago. Did you join the anti-war march in London?\n\nI wasn\u2019t on the big march; I was on the one before that. When the big march happened, I was in America shooting Pirates of the Caribbean and feeling utterly stupid that I was in a pirate costume and all my mates were on an anti-war march. I remember sitting in the makeup bus and there being a conversation along the lines of \u201cWe are going into Iraq to pay them back for 9/11\u201d and thinking \u201cHold on - I don\u2019t think that was Iraq!\u201d For my generation it was the first time that we had been really politically engaged - and it didn\u2019t change anything. There was disillusionment after that. Quite severe. The way that we viewed politicians and the world was massively coloured by the weeks leading up to that conflict.\n\nAnd led to where we are now? Katharine has that great line in the film, which was cheered at Sundance: \u201cJust because you are prime minister that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re allowed to make things up.\u201d\n\nLook where we are now. The questions we have about government and accountability go back to that. Why are politicians who lie not held to account? The script made me think hard about that.\n\nThe movie is very faithful to the story \u2013 which means that it doesn\u2019t have a Hollywood ending\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a very British story in that way. It has that heroic failure about it. But what are you going to do? Write an ending in which the war didn\u2019t happen? She didn\u2019t stop it. She told the truth and there was little consequence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Keira Knightley as Katharine Gun in Official Secrets.

I\u2019ve always loved a political thriller. I know some people like escapism, and that\u2019s fine, but I like to be challenged. I was watching Paths of Glory last night, the Kubrick film, 1957, black and white, Kirk Douglas, about the futility of war, and political lies, and it\u2019s amazing.\n\nThere is an audience for these films just now\u2026\n\nI hope so. People are politically re-engaged. You know, different times create different audiences. I think the National Theatre was set up when it was because it was a moment when we suddenly wanted to walk in other people\u2019s shoes. And now, at a time when nationalism is on the rise, it seems important to set these questions [of patriotism] out there. Whether they get to the \u2018right\u2019 audience or not is another question of course.\n\nDo you have any qualms about putting your head above the parapet, as it were, and talking about political issues?\n\nOne thing I learned from being in the public eye when I was very young is this: you can say nothing and some people will hate you, and you can say something and some people will hate you. So you might as well, if you are feeling like it, say something. If I am asked my opinion, I generally don\u2019t have a problem giving it.\n\nYou don\u2019t do any social media\u2026\n\nI had an account for about five seconds. I watched it accumulate, like, 100 followers in three seconds and I got so freaked out that I turned it off straight away. . And then Facebook. I was on for a day 10 years ago, and never posted anything on it, but it still emails me all the time as if I am a member or whatever.\n\nThat has obviously been a conscious decision\u2026\n\nIt has. I mean, the thing is, I don\u2019t have very much that I want to share in that way. I have a child and another one on the way, and I want their privacy to be safe and sacred until they are old enough to choose what they want to do with their lives. I don\u2019t write about family life \u2013 though of course I did write a very long essay about my vagina splitting! I am better at that kind of thing. Also I am rubbish at taking pictures, so my Instagram feed or whatever would be an embarrassment.\n\nWhere do you go for news?\n\nI get my news from the Guardian and the New York Times and the Financial Times at the weekend. I feel I should be branching out more, because I am reading papers that I generally agree with. My husband has - really kindly! - forced me into reading all of the climate change books that he has been reading. Which is just great when you are pregnant. I am halfway through Uninhabitable Earth. I have to do the Naomi Klein next. I spend half my time saying sorry to my baby in there. Maybe I should start reading all those rightwing newspapers and then I could pretend everything will be fine\u2026\n\nThe film centres on the courage of Katharine Gun in telling the truth. Can you imagine doing that yourself in that situation?\n\nHonestly, I have no idea whether I would \u2013 and I think that is what I find fascinating about it. It\u2019s funny; we all like to think we are truth-tellers. But we also know what the consequences are for truth-tellers like Katharine. Pretty horrific. What is interesting, culturally, I think, is that America has had relatively more whistleblowers than Britain. I think that generally speaking we do what we are told, and we toe the line. I have no idea why that is. Would I do it? I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. I think it might even depend on how I was feeling that day.\n\nOfficial Secrets is released on 18 October", "description": "The actor talks about Official Secrets, in which she plays Katharine Gun, the whistleblower who tried to stop the Iraq war", "authors": ["Tim Adams", "Richard Norton-Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37816d4a19be7cb1f0f3a31292806e53c9995caa/0_217_7232_4341/master/7232.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bcfdbd0f5830ba9950c619007fbcd150", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
