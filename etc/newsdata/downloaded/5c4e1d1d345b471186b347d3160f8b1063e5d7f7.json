Even if they hadn't got the keys there was a big hole there.\n\nThe masked and hooded burglar stretches up to disable the floodlight sensors of the house\n\nOne of the thieves holds down the chair while his accomplice perches on the backrest to reach the security box of the house which they later ransacked\n\n'They turned the power off for the alarm but the alarm has got battery back-up. They scrambled in, making a mess, pulling clothes out.\n\n'The cheeky burglars even shut the lounge curtains so they wouldn't be seen.\n\nThe female victim, who is asthmatic, suffered a panic attack when she saw the devastation the raiders had caused.\n\nShe said: 'I have been so ill since. I suffer from osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia and have an ectopic heartbeat.\n\n'I was already being treated for anxiety and now I'm even more anxious.'\n\nShe added: 'We now lock a key on our bedroom door at night and lock ourselves in.'\n\nThe couple said they do not own anything particularly expensive, such as high-end electronics.\n\nBut the burglars still took something of value to the wife, who lost a treasured item belonging to her father.\n\nShe said: 'The only thing they took were ring boxes, which were empty and some gold cufflinks that were Spitfires. They were my dad's and he died two years ago.'\n\nOne of the thieves calls to his accomplice to come to help him, as he effortlessly disables the security system\n\nThe couple believe that the thieves were searching for car keys to steal their BMW - which was being used by the couple at the time.\n\n'We have got a BMW and the police think they were looking for the spare key and would try and take it when we got back.'\n\nIt is suspected that this was a carefully planned burglary, as the wife says she was alerted to two men scouting out the property days earlier.\n\nShe said: 'A couple of days before, on the Thursday, I looked out of my bedroom window and saw two lads in a black car. Both had their hoods up and they were looking up.\n\n'A neighbour came around and said two lads with dark hoods in what she thought was a black Ford Focus, had parked behind the hedge.\n\n'I have heard sometimes they get out when you are unlocking or locking the car.\n\n'They may have been looking to carjack it. My neighbour saw them at 2pm and I saw them in the morning.\n\n'Both me and my neighbour had the same suspicion.'\n\nThe police are trying to track down the burglars, but forensics were unable to retrieve prints from the property as the pair were gloved.\n\nA spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Officers were called to reports of a burglary at a home in Queslett Road East, Sutton Coldfield, at about 7.45pm on Sunday, October 20.\n\n'The offenders appear to have broken in through a locked back door and stole jewellery of sentimental value.'\n\nThe husband took a day off work to replace the damaged sensors, lights and cameras.\n\nThe burglars popped the window with a crowbar and the homeowner said she has changed from toughened glass to laminated glass 'which won't shatter', which was recommended by her insurance company.", "description": "The crowbar-wielding thugs bludgeoned the floodlight sensors and smashed their way into the Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham property, on Sunday evening.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/10/20173086-0-image-a-23_1571995762047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
