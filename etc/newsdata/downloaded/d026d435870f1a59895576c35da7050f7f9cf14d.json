Though it was not included in the official statement about the talks, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said China agreed to double its spending on American agricultural products, reaching $40 billion to $50 billion per year over the next two years. The U.S. agreed not to raise to 30% from 25% its tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods \u2014 a move that was originally set to take effect on Tuesday.\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. exported $19.5 billion in agricultural products to China, according to the American Farm Bureau. That number fell to $9.1 billion last year.\n\nIt is unclear what, and in what quantity, China has resumed purchasing.\n\nSoybeans, one of the U.S.\u2019s most lucrative exports, has been among the hardest hit during the trade war. The decrease in purchases of the product has crippled many American farmers and resulted in the Trump administration\u2019s spending billions of dollars to compensate them.\n\nLast year China bought its smallest amount of U.S. soybeans in over a decade.\n\nChina recognizes that the farm belt is among President Trump\u2019s most important election constituencies, and has zeroed in on agricultural products during the trade war. Other products Beijing has targeted include pork, beef, vegetables and sorghum.\n\nSee: Trump agriculture secretary says during Wisconsin visit that family-run dairy farms may not survive\n\nAt last week\u2019s trade talks, China agreed to exempt some American pork imports, state-run CCTV reported. Pork is by far China\u2019s most consumed meat, but its domestic pork industry has been decimated by African swine fever, which has resulted in the culling of more than a million pigs, according to the Chinese agricultural ministry. The price of pork has risen 50% in China over the last year, its commerce ministry said. Dutch bank Rabobank estimates that by the end of 2019, China\u2019s pork production could be cut in half.\n\nAmid the epidemic, which has infected pigs in all of China\u2019s provinces, Beijing has largely turned to Europe for its pork imports, while raising tariffs on U.S. pork twice since 2018.\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are slated to meet next month at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile. That meeting comes just a month before the U.S. is put a 15% tariff on billions\u2019 worth of Chinese goods that have not been targeted already. These include consumer goods such as smartphones and computers.\n\nPostponement of the December tariff increase was not included in the recent trade talks. If that increase goes into effect, it would mean nearly all of China\u2019s $550 billion in exports to the U.S. would face taxation.\n\nRead on: Two maps that show how the U.S. trade war with China has been hurting \u2018Trump country\u2019\n\nTanner Brown is a contributor to MarketWatch and Barron\u2019s and producer of the Caixin-Sinica Business Brief podcast.", "description": "President Donald Trump said Sunday that China has begun purchasing U.S. agricultural products, just two days after the two countries reached a tentative...", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT203_trump_MG_20191013201717.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
