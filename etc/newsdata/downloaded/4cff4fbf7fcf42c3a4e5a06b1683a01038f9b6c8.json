You will be promptly returned home.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview Thursday on \"The Story,\" Bukele, 38, told Martha MacCallum when he sees the high volume of people fleeing El Salvador he understands there are domestic factors that lead to the exodus.\n\nSALVADORAN PRESIDENT SAYS HIS COUNTRY IS TO BLAME FOR MIGRANTS DROWNING IN THE RIO GRANDE\n\n\"We have a problem that we have to fix in El Salvador -- We have been sending migrants to the United States and elsewhere since the 80s and now we have almost a quarter of our population living abroad,\" he said.\n\n\"When you have your own people fleeing their homes it's not because they found a job somewhere else... then you have something to fix in your country.\"\n\n\"Whose job is it to fix? El Salvador's job.\"\n\nBukele pointed to previous administrations in San Salvador that have not helped stem the flow of migrants out of the country nor accepted responsibility for the problems.\n\nHe said there are other Central American nations with poverty and other systemic issues that are not in the same position.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBukele pointed to Costa Rica, saying that nation doesn't \"send migrants away\" but has instead taken in migrants from countries like Nicaragua.\n\n\"We want to change the fact that the country doesn't send migrants forcibly away,\" he said, hoping for a day when Salvadorans \"have their dreams come true at home.\"", "description": "El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said his country must tackle the problems that lead to a large number of his people seeking\u00a0asylum in the U.S.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/The-Story-Bukele.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
