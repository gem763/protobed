Vanessa has just won a Bafta and she\u2019s brilliant, and in a way you have the ghost of the real Margaret and the ghost of the actress who played her.\n\n\u2018You also have the fact everyone has an opinion about the woman and yet ultimately very few people knew what her private life was like and that\u2019s the sort of the joy of the job.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while Helena stressed that the historical drama series is not intended to be a documentary, she hopes the public will be able to relate to the message behind the series, as she mentions she \u2018does not look like\u2019 Margaret.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t look like her. You just hope you get something of an idiom and a blade or a scent of them and it transforms your inner landscape,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018The Crown has been very, very compassionate to most of the members of the family and has been very positive.\n\n\u2018A lot of it is true and there is a whole floor of researchers.\u2019\n\nHelena is taking over the role from Vanessa Kirby (Picture: Netflix)\n\nThe 53\u2013year-old also believes that Margaret was \u2018vulnerable\u2019, and misinterpreted by many.\n\nShe added: \u2018I think Margaret was very much her [Queen Elizabeth II] father\u2019s daughter. She had the anxiety he had, and I think a lot of people interpreted her as angry, rude and tough.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018She wasn\u2019t tough at all, and I think she was quite vulnerable and often attack was the best form of defence.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlongside Helena, Olivia Colman will be joining the cast to take over the role of Queen Elizabeth II, following on from Claire Foy, while Tobias Menzies will portray Prince Phillip, after Matt Smith played him during the first two seasons.\n\nSeason three of The Crown will be released to Netflix on 17 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
