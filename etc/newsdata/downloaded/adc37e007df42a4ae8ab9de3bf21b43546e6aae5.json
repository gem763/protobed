Blizzard is a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, which is partially owned by the Chinese com pany Tencen t .\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Blizzard said the player had violated a competition rule barring any act that \u201cbrings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our e-sports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe political land mines aren\u2019t always easy to see.\n\nThe upscale jeweler Tiffany found itself at the center of a social media firestorm on Monday after posting an image of a model covering her eye with her right hand. To many Chinese internet users, the gesture evoked another symbol of the Hong Kong protests: a woman shot in the eye with a police beanbag round during a demonstration, whose image later appeared in countless posters and memes.\n\nThe photo posted by Tiffany had been taken in May, before the protests started. But it was a no-win situation for the company, which had already warned investors that it would be hurt by the drop in tourism amid the protests in Hong Kong, its fourth-largest market by sales. Mainland China is a much larger market, and the company has been rapidly expanding its presence there.\n\nThe photo \u201cwas in no way intended to be a political statement of any kind,\u201d a spokesman for Tiffany said in an emailed statement, after the offending tweet was deleted. \u201cWe regret that it may be perceived as such, and in turn have removed the image from our digital and social media channels and will discontinue its use effective immediately.\u201d", "description": "The N.B.A. and others are finding it difficult to stay neutral in an increasingly politicized, and punitive, China.", "authors": ["Amy Qin", "Julie Creswell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/world/08china-biz1/08china-biz1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
