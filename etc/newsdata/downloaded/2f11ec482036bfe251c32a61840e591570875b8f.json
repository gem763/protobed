You can sign up for free right here.\n\nPresident Trump began his day with a complaint that Fox News \"doesn't deliver for US anymore.\" Via Twitter, he criticized Andrew Napolitano, Shep Smith, and Donna Brazile. He said the network \"is so different than it used to be.\" And he added, \"Oh well, I'm President!\"\n\nFox declined to comment on Trump's latest jabs. Maybe the network was banking on that old aphorism, \"If you don't like the weather, just wait a few minutes.\" Because on Thursday night, during a rally in Minneapolis, Trump praised his Fox friends in detail.\n\nHe started with the morning show: \"Ainsley and Steve and, by the way, Brian's gotten a lot better. He was a 7, he's getting close to a 10 territory.\" Then he brought up Pete Hegseth and Jesse Watters. Folks in the crowd shouted Tucker Carlson's name. \"Tucker's been very good,\" Trump said. Then: \"The legendary Sean Hannity!\" He praised Hannity's ratings. Then it was Fox Business Network's turn. He gave Maria Bartiromo a shoutout. And \"the great Lou Dobbs.\"\n\n\"And many more!\" he said. I think he was worried about forgetting someone. \"How about Greg?\" he said, talking about Greg Gutfeld of \"The Five\" on Fox News. \"Greg used to hate me, now he's good!\" He mentioned one more host: \"I would be in such trouble if I forget Judge Jeanine!\"", "description": "President Trump began his day with a complaint that Fox News \"doesn't deliver for US anymore.\"", "authors": ["Analysis Brian Stelter", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191010205118-03-trump-minneapolis-rally-1010-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
