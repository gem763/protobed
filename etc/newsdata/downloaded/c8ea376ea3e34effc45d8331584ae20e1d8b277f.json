Trump offered no explanation for the apparent alteration.\n\nThe doctored map is just the latest in an ongoing saga wherein the president has doubled, if not tripled, down on claims that Alabama was in Dorian\u2019s path. The original forecast from Aug. 29 predicted the hurricane making landfall in central Florida and dying out after crossing through the state. The president was briefed last Thursday using that exact map, according to photographs released that day by the White House.\n\nNowhere in that prediction was Alabama slated to be in the storm\u2019s path. And yet, on Sunday, the president warned that Alabama could be \u201chit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d Despite the Birmingham branch of the National Weather Service blasting out that \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian,\u201d the president made the false claim two more times. On Monday, he tweeted that he said nothing wrong, claiming that \u201cunder certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some \u2018hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nAsked on Wednesday why the map appeared to have been doctored, Trump gave a bizarre non-denial. \u201cI don't know. I don't know. I don't know,\u201d he repeatedly said.\n\nHe then quadrupled down on the false Alabama claim: \u201cI know that Alabama was in the original forecast, they thought it would get a piece of it. We have a better map... in all cases Alabama was hit, if not lightly in some cases pretty hard. They gave it a 95 percent chance.\u201d\n\nThe NOAA, meanwhile, declined to address the president\u2019s map discrepancies, referring all questions to the White House. (The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.)\n\nThe president has a longstanding habit of refusing to back down from his incorrect assertions, even when proven definitively wrong; and he has an equally longstanding streak of enlisting aides and associates to help him perpetuate his lie or falsehood.\n\nIn this first year of his presidency, Trump held a meeting with military veterans and advocates in the White House, and refused to concede that it was napalm, not Agent Orange, in the famous scene from Apocalypse Now\u2014even though Vietnam War vets told him to his face that he was mistaken.\n\nAnd during his days hosting reality-TV show The Apprentice, years before he became president, Trump wouldn\u2019t stop calling rapper Lil Jon an \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d even after staffers informed him it was a racial slur and that he meant to say \u201cUncle Sam,\u201d in reference to the Uncle Sam costume the rap artist wore. Producers pleaded with him to stop, but Trump just kept telling them, \u201cNo, that\u2019s a saying, it\u2019s Uncle Tom.\u201d\n\nThis has been a banner series of weeks for Trump and hurricanes.\n\nLate last month, the president posted a tweet complaining that Dorian looked like it was headed toward Puerto Rico, and took the time to snipe at his political enemies on the island. Shortly before that, Axios reported that Trump had repeatedly suggested to senior homeland-security and national-security officials that they look into deploying nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes as they form. The president was serious enough that, according to Axios, his remarks were even noted in a secret National Security Council memo.\n\nAfter the story published, Trump publicly and repeatedly insisted that he never made such comments to senior officials, and that Axios made it all up. (The Daily Beast can confirm Axios\u2019s reporting, per two sources familiar with Trump\u2019s comments.)\n\nIn the past, some of the president\u2019s private discussions regarding hurricanes have been decidedly more tongue-in-cheek than his nuke-the-hurricanes musings or the apparent doctoring of a government forecast map.\n\nSince assuming the office, Trump has on multiple occasions joked about hostile or foreign nations, such as China, using top-secret technology to start hurricanes to attack America, according to two people with direct knowledge of his recurring joke.", "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d the president said when asked why the NOAA map he cited appeared to be doctored with black Sharpie.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2634,w_4683,x_1165,y_204/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567628858/GettyImages-1172258193_jwkqvj"}
