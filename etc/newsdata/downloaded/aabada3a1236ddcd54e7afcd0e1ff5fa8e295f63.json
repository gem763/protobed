(AP) - Pressure is mounting on Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota to perform better or possibly be benched in favor of backup Ryan Tannehill.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what some angry Titans fans would like to see.\n\nWhile Mariota has been inconsistent while being constantly evaluated as to see if he\u2019s worthy of a multi-million dollar long-term extension, fans have been expressing their frustration. One even called into a radio show wanting the Titans general manager to trade the fifth-year quarterback for a block of cheese.\n\nVeteran tight end Delanie Walker knows how the Titans can best help their quarterback.\n\nJust win.\n\n\u201cWe win a game for him, make every play, protect him so he can look like he\u2019s the star that he is,\u201d Walker said Wednesday.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowl tight end said Mariota is not the guy who will ever point the finger at anybody but himself. Yet Walker remains confident in Mariota even with the Titans (1-2) on a two-game losing streak heading to Atlanta (1-2) Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been getting it done,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough being a quarterback in this league. I want to say you take all the blame no matter what and that guy, he ain\u2019t going to say nothing about anyone. It don\u2019t matter that someone dropped the pass on third down or he got sacked multiple times. He\u2019s going to just say it\u2019s his fault, and he got to do better. And that\u2019s the sad part.\u201d\n\nMariota looked his best completing all six of his passes for 143 yards in the second half of Tennessee\u2019s season-opening win in Cleveland with three touchdowns. The No. 2 pick overall has yet to have a pass intercepted through three games. He ranks 20th in the NFL with 706 yards passing but 10th with a 99.3 passer rating.\n\nThen there\u2019s the other side of the ledger.\n\nHe\u2019s thrown only one TD pass in the past two games. Mariota has overthrown wide-open receivers, going 6 of 16 in a 20-7 loss to Jacksonville last week. Mariota has been sacked a league-high 17 times, the most a quarterback has been sacked in the first three games since 2002.\n\nMariota said repeatedly Wednesday that he can play better.\n\n\u201cIf I can do a better job of moving in and around the pocket, I can help our guys out up front and deliver the football to our guys to make plays,\u201d Mariota said.\n\nHe also believes it\u2019s possible to carry over the rhythm from that loss to the Jaguars where he finished with 304 yards passing despite being sacked nine times. Starting faster would help. Mariota was 3 of 6 in the first quarter, something he thinks can be fixed simply by completing passes.\n\n\u201cArt\u2019s doing a great job of allowing our guys to get open, I\u2019ve just got to complete them,\u201d Mariota said of Titans offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s like a jump shooter in basketball, as I see guys kind of catch the ball, I think we get into a rhythm as an entire offense, we\u2019ll find ways to sustain drives and score points.\u201d\n\nMariota thanked Titans coach Mike Vrabel for a practice Monday focused on fundamentals and details. The quarterback said sometimes those things can slip a bit as players study up on opponents during the season.\n\nVrabel believes practicing well is a big key to getting Mariota into rhythm and throwing well in games. The Titans coach also believes Mariota wasn\u2019t all bad in the loss to the Jaguars.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that they were all great, or they were all bad because there were some good throws in there, but there are things that we need to fix, and that\u2019s a collective effort throughout the offense, and me, and the coaching staff,\u201d Vrabel said.\n\nNotes: The Titans practiced in pads Wednesday and focused on first and second downs where they have struggled. \u2026 Walker (left knee), LB Daren Bates (ankle) and RG Kevin Pamphile (knee) did not practice. LB Rashaan Evans (wrist) was limited and wore a yellow jersey. LB Wesley Woodyard (quad) practiced fully after being inactive in Jacksonville.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.
