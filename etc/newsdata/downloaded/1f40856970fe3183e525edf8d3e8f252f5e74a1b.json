This week, TechCrunch\u2019s Connie Loizos hopped on the line with prominent investor, entrepreneur, thought leader, and Techstars co-founder Brad Feld to chat about the latest edition of his book \u201cVenture Deals,\u201d his advice to founders and investors, and his take on hot-button issues of the day.\n\nIn their conversation, Brad and Connie discuss the need to know information when it comes to preparing for, structuring and executing venture deals, and how that information has changed over the past several decades. Feld walks through the major topics that have been added in the latest edition of the book, such as how to handle venture debt, along with tactical attributes that aren\u2019t currently in the book, such as secondary market trading.\n\nBrad also shares his take on the most effective fundraising tactics for founders, and which common pieces of advice might be overblown.\n\nBrad Feld: \u201cI think the approach to the amount of money that you\u2019re raising is both nuanced and evolves based on what financing round you\u2019re at. So if you\u2019re in an early round, some of the characteristics are different than if you\u2019re in a later round. But I think the general truism\u2026 that I like to use when people say, \u2018Well, how much money should I raise?\u2019 I start with two variables and you the entrepreneur get to define those two variables. The two variables are: the amount of money you raise and what getting to the next level means. The amount of money you should raise is the amount of money that you need to get your business to the next level. There are lots of different ways to define what next level is and by forcing yourself internally to define next level and then define what you need in terms of capital to get to that next level\u2026 when you\u2019re raising that first round of financing or even the second or third round of financing, it helps you size rationally what you need versus reactively to whatever the market characteristics are. I actually encourage entrepreneurs to raise the least amount of money they need to get to the next level, or at least that\u2019s the number that they go out to market with. Not a range, not a big number because you\u2019re trying to drive some kind of valuation characteristic off a big number, but the amount of money that you actually think you need to get to the next level. Then if you can be oversubscribed, that\u2019s an awesome situation.\u201d\n\nFeld and Connie dive deeper into current issues in the startup and venture landscape, including Brad\u2019s take on the impact of the SoftBank Vision Fund, what went down internally and externally at both WeWork and Uber, as well as how boards, executives and founders can manage cult of personality and static company cultures.\n\nFor access to the full transcription and the call audio \u2014 and for the opportunity to participate in future conference calls \u2014 become a member of Extra Crunch.

That was at the Autodesk Lab if I remember correctly.\n\nLoizos: Yes. It\u2019s good to hear your voice, and thank you for joining us on this call. We have a lot of readers who are big fans of yours that are on the line and are eager to learn about your book \u201cVenture Deals\u201d and your broader thoughts about the current state of the market. That said \u2014 and I know you only have so much time \u2014 let\u2019s dive first into the book. So Wiley, your publisher has just put out the fourth edition of this book \u201cVenture Deals,\u201d and it\u2019s really easy to appreciate why. I was looking through it and it\u2019s so incredibly instructive how venture deals come together and possible pitfalls to avoid. And given there are always new entrepreneurs emerging, it continues to be highly relevant.\n\nHow do you go about updating a book like this, given that some things change and some things stay the same?", "description": "Extra Crunch offers members the opportunity to tune into conference calls led and moderated by the TechCrunch writers you read every day.
