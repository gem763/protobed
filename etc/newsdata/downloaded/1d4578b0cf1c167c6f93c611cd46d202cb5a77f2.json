But with the upcoming release, the singer and actress is not just aiming to make people feel beautiful. Instead, she wants them to be transformed.\n\n\u201cI never felt beautiful, and I still have days that I don\u2019t feel beautiful,\u201d Gaga told Allure. \u201cAll of the insecurities that I\u2019ve dealt with my whole life from being bullied when I was younger, they come right back up to bite me. Then I put makeup on, and before I know it I feel this superhero within. It gives me those wings to fly.\u201d\n\nLady Gaga is talking about the transformative power of makeup in the October issue of Allure. (Photo: Allure) More\n\nThe 33-year-old, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, appeared on the cover of the magazine\u2019s October 2019 issue where she talked about her passion for cosmetics and a deeper connection to them. For her, it all started somewhat stereotypically as she watched her own mom apply makeup. However, it quickly took on a different meaning for Gaga.\n\n\u201cI grew up with this understanding that you can be brave in many different ways,\u201d she explained, \u201cand one of those ways is makeup.\u201d\n\nEven as she\u2019s evolved into a performer under the stage name Lady Gaga, makeup has been the way that she transforms into that powerful personality, despite whatever else is going on in her life. She even recalled a difficult and busy time when she was on tour, preparing for two of her biggest shows and filming A Star is Born, when the makeup chair was her solace.\n\n\u201cSarah [Tanno, Lady Gaga\u2019s makeup artist] would pick me up off the floor, sit me in a chair, dry my tears, and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to put on your face now,\u2019\u201d Gaga said. \u201cIf I cried while she was putting on my makeup, I would apologize, and she would say, \u2018It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, Gaga hopes that young people who get a hold of her product will be able to feel that same way when using her eyeshadows and lip glosses, and even learn something about themselves in the process.\n\n\u201cI would like all gender identities to know very clearly that they are included, and never exploited, ever,\u201d she said. \u201cI want that little boy at home that might like to be called a girl to say, \u2018Mommy, I want to wear Dynasty. It\u2019s a Glam Attack.\u2019 And then Mommy goes, \u2018Oh, my son wants to be called a girl, and he wants the Glam Attack.\u2019 And then she goes and she gets it for him. And he uses it. And then there\u2019s a bond.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like when kids used to come to my shows with their parents, and they\u2019d lean over and they\u2019d say, \u2018Mommy and Daddy, I\u2019m gay.\u2019 Or, \u2018I\u2019m not a boy; I\u2019m a girl.\u2019 Or, \u2018I\u2019m not a girl; I\u2019m a boy.\u2019 I have heard those stories so many times, over and over, for all of the years that I have been in this business. And I want the same thing that I\u2019ve had in my concerts to happen with this company.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like just being excited that there\u2019s a party going on down the street where everybody\u2019s invited,\u201d Gaga said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not changing people\u2019s lives, what are we doing here?\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Lady Gaga is opening up about the role that makeup played in her superstar transformation, and how she wants others to feel the same with her new line.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J0tH3MwnUcRuoq3ppKbvvg--~B/aD01OTk7dz00ODE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/c2a941b0-d590-11e9-a9fe-8769dc3dfee8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
