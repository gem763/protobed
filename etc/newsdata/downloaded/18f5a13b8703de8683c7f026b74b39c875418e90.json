[There's] A lot of people involved. Guys are trying to surge out the chapel, a lot of these guys are drug dealers. I work very closely with the Imam, to make it as decent and a space as we can.'\n\nIn last night's episode ITV's Inside Prison: Britain Behind Bars, staff at Deerbolt prison revealed they were struggling to manage drug dealers who were hijacking the weekly Muslim prayer service (pictured, inside the chapel)\n\nIn Deerbolt prison there are over 100 practicing Muslim men aged between 18 to 24.

Pictured, Rick Martin with Imam\n\n'People come not to just take part in the prayers, they will come too for association,' he said. 'They will talk to each other and have a laugh at the same time. I have a responsibility of making sure everyone is safe in this area.'\n\nHowever, it was revealed the safety had been threatened in recent weeks after a number of fights had broken out in the chapel between inmates - with some suspecting worshippers were exploiting the service to smuggle illicit items.\n\n'We have intelligence to suggest two guys have been paid to cause violence to create a distraction so another group can pass drugs and pass phones,' said Violence Reduction Officer, Rick Martin.\n\nThe Imam added: 'We look through all the CCTV, all the body camera footage, all the intelligence coming in.'\n\nIn the episode, it was revealed that Jonaid al Hassain was one of the prisoners causing chaos in the prayers\n\nSpeaking of his aims for weekly prayers, Imam said: 'My focus is to have split services. We want people to have access to weekly service in the most safe possible way'\n\n'Anyone who may be part of the problem or creating a disturbance in Friday prayers - we will have to ban them.'\n\nOne prisoner who continued to cause chaos in the prayers was identified as Jonaid al Hassain.\n\nThe 25-year-old was serving time for drug related offences, but also found ways to 'clean up' inside, having accumulated \u00a380 worth of shower gels in his cell.\n\nHis reputation as a wheeler dealer drew unwanted attention from prison security, leading him to be banned from Friday prayers.\n\n'They're saying drugs are being passed, this is being passed - but they're just presuming s***, before they even know what is going on,' he explained.\n\n'You've never caught anyone doing nothing. Looking for anyone to do anything. They let me go to work, they let me go gym, but they don't let me go chapel? Don't make no sense.'\n\nHe added: 'Rules are made to be broken man. It's a game in it. I play the game.'\n\n'Smart phones, little phones, drugs, spice, cocaine. Everything is available man. At a price. You've got to be two steps ahead in jail. They've tried to do sh** about it, but hey can't. We're just too clever for them man.'\n\nOne inmate who was found to be causing mischief said of the policies in place: 'Rules are made to be broken man. It's a game in it. I play the game.' Pictured, inmates\n\nViolence Reduction Officer Rick Martin told how the staff had intelligence to suggest two guys had been paid to cause violence to create a distraction so another group can pass drugs and pass phones (pictured)\n\nThe prison team introduced a metal detector into the entrance of chapel in order to scan the men before they enter the prayer room.\n\nAnd Duty governor Flack spelled out the new safety plan to groups at Friday plans, saying: 'If you don't want to come to chapel, then you don't have to. If you want to mess about, you'll be removed.'\n\nBut the news doesn't go down well, and another fight soon disrupted the prayers.\n\n'We've had weeks and weeks and weeks of the disruption to the Muslim service,' said police officer Nick Martin. 'Nobody wants confrontation in a place of worship, but unfortunately sometimes it must be done.'\n\nLater, Flack went to meet the Imam and asked him how certain men felt from being excluded from prayer.\n\n'They feel the prison can't cater for their needs, they feel violated,' he explained. 'My focus is to have split services. We want people to have access to weekly service in the most safe possible way.'\n\nLater, he told how he'd reviewed who could come to chapel and allowed Jonaid to return to prayer.\n\n'It's important from a faith perspective to teach them about what is expected at chapel,' he said. 'I want people to pray, we want people to have access to prayer.'\n\nThe prison team introduced a metal detector into the entrance of chapel in order to scan the men before they enter the prayer room.
