Once he took flesh, Jesus ceased to be a God and became a man until his death on the cross.\u201d\n\nScalfari goes on to say that the pope told him that Jesus\u2019 words from the cross \u201cMy God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\u201d testify to Christ\u2019s merely human nature.\n\n\u201cPope Francis told me: \u2018There are the proof that Jesus of Nazareth, once he became a man, even a man of exceptional virtue, was in no way a God,\u2019\u201d Scalfari wrote.\n\nThe divinity of Jesus Christ is a central tenet of Christianity. The Nicene Creed, a summary of Christian belief, reads (in part): \u201cI believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the Vatican has been obliged to issue a clarification following papal interviews with Mr. Scalfari, which has led many to suspect that the pope continues to grant him interviews because he desires the confusion and ambiguity that Scalfari\u2019s articles sow.\n\nPope Francis has repeatedly downplayed the importance of doctrine, the official teaching of the Church on matters of faith and morals. Being a Christian does not mean primarily \u201cadhering to a certain doctrine,\u201d Francis has said, but rather in binding one\u2019s life to the person of Jesus. He has moreover often criticized whose who insist on right doctrine as being \u201crigid,\u201d \u201cpharisaical,\u201d and \u201clegalistic.\u201d\n\nOver the years of his pontificate, the pope has granted Mr. Scalfari numerous informal interviews and it has been generally understood that he uses this vehicle to get his ideas out, especially more controversial ones, while always maintaining a certain degree of plausible deniability if something Scalfari relates causes problems.\n\nAfter one such papal interview with Scalfari in 2013, veteran Vatican analyst John L. Allen offered advice as to how these conversations should be read. He noted that though the words may not always be precise, the content is generally trustworthy.\n\n\u201cLook, Italian journalism has many strengths, but a passion for factual accuracy is not among them. It is what it is,\u201d Allen said.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway is, the big picture is accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think, in any fundamental way, he misrepresented the pope\u2019s thought. But I also think it\u2019s impossible to know where Francis ends and Scalfari begins, at the level of detail. I would just be very careful. I, myself, will not take any direct quotes out of that interview and present them as coming from the pope.\u201d\n\nPope Francis himself has never denied anything that Scalfari has written about him and seems content to continue granting him interviews.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Vatican refuted claims Pope Francis had denied the divinity of Jesus Christ, saying this was a \u201cfree interpretation\u201d of words.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
