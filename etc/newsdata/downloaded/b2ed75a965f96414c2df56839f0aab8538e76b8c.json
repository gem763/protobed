While the Senate hearings themselves \u201chad little effect on perceptions of Nixon\u2019s guilt, they did make impeachment more acceptable\u2026 once the clear and convincing \u2018proof\u2019 had been produced,\u201d the Langs wrote. The hearings revealed that Nixon had taped all conversations in his offices, leading to a battle between Congress and Nixon to hand over the tapes, which, in turn, led to the Saturday Night Massacre in October. Nixon would eventually release edited transcripts of the tapes in April of 1974.\n\n\n\nOver this period, support for impeachment grew steadily, but it wasn\u2019t until the House Judiciary Committee recommended impeachment in July of 1974 and the Supreme Court ordered the release of the tapes\u2014including the \u201csmoking gun\u201d\u2014that public opinion shifted dramatically in favor of removing Nixon. \u201cWhen that tape came out and members of Congress heard it, it was black and white what the president was trying to do,\u201d Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton, told me. \u201cHe could lie a million times about it and his supporters could explain it away but in the end you could hear exactly what was going on.\u201d After the release of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d on August 5, 1974, a third of Republicans and over half of independents supported impeachment.\n\nTrump has two firewalls that Nixon did not: party loyalty and conservative media. \u201cIt was such a different time,\u201d Thomas E. Patterson, a professor of government and the press at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, said. \u201cIf you go back to 1973 and 1974, that was the low-mark in terms of party loyalty. There was quite a bit of dissatisfaction with both parties, which took a different form than it does today. You had a real mushrooming in the early \u201970s of the number of independents\u2014and they were really unanchored. Split-ticket voting was very high in that period. When you look at today, you get a lot of dissatisfaction with the two parties but party loyalty is hardened. Split-ticket voting has really collapsed in the last 25 years or so.\u201d\n\nToday, the number of independents is still high, but most voters reliably vote for one party. \u201cThere are fewer persuadable voters\u2014not that there are none,\u201d Amy Fried, a professor of political science at the University of Maine, said. \u201cBut to the extent that people are closely attached to a political party, they\u2019re not going to change their views.\u201d This, the Langs found, was also true during Watergate: Republicans and Democrats who had closely followed the scandal were dramatically less likely to change their opinions than those who were less interested. But there were more Americans in the undecided column than there are today.\n\nThe question, then, is whether Trump\u2019s support among Republicans will eventually erode. This would almost certainly require the conservative media to turn on the president\u2014to stop feeding right-wing voters misleading or downright false narratives in his defense. That may be too much to expect. But as Nixon wrote in his memoir, he knew that \u201cthe main danger of being impeached would come precisely from the public\u2019s being conditioned to the idea that I was going to be impeached.\u201d Trump\u2019s removal doesn\u2019t look inevitable today, but neither did Nixon\u2019s until the very end. With Democrats now united on impeaching Trump, the conditioning of the American public is well underway.", "description": "Democrats who want to impeach Trump would do well to heed history.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e7c93f3a6de28b92f66bc0be13d5368ca003cf2d.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
