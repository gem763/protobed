The court's action came on the first day of its new term.\n\nAccording to Acorda, Ampyra was the first drug approved to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis, an incurable and potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord that can lead to symptoms including pain, visual impairments and difficulty walking.\n\nAcorda's patents covered how to treat patients with a medicine that was first identified in 1902.\n\nAcorda in 2014 sued units of London-based Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC, Pennsylvania-based Mylan NV, and Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, which were planning generic versions of Ampyra.\n\nThe Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court located in Washington, last year invalidated four of the five patents protecting Ampyra from competition. The appeals court said the four canceled patents were not entitled to legal protection because they were obvious when compared to the fifth patent, which preceded them. That fifth patent expired in July 2018.\n\nAccording to regulatory filings, Acorda's sales of Ampyra for the six-month period ending June 30 dropped 67 percent to $84.7 million compared to the same period last year.\n\nAt issue in the case is the Federal Circuit's view that certain pre-existing patents can make it easier to find that later patents based on them are obvious and thus invalid, even if those patents led to commercial success or addressed an unmet need in patients.\n\nAcorda told the justices that this view \"impairs patent rights and deters innovation.\" A group of drug companies including Allergan Plc filed a brief backing Acorda.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Acorda Therapeutics Inc's appeal of a lower court ruling that allowed generic versions of its multiple sclerosis treatment Ampyra and caused the drug's sales to plummet.
