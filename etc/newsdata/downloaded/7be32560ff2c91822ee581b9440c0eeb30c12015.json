The request came after Trump had withheld $391 million in security aid to Ukraine, which he later released.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has coffee with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, U.S. September 20, 2019.

The younger Biden had served as a director of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nParnas and Fruman have been asked, as part of the impeachment inquiry, to produce documents and give testimony.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has described the impeachment probe as a partisan smear.\n\nProsecutors say Parnas and Fruman committed to raise $20,000 for Sessions as part of an effort to get Trump to remove U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nThat effort was carried out at the request of at least one Ukrainian official, prosecutors said.\n\nTrump ordered Yovanovitch removed in May. Yovanovitch testified in the House impeachment inquiry on Oct. 11.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nProsecutors said Parnas and Fruman funneled money from an unnamed Russian businessman to political candidates in several states in order to help the businessman obtain permits needed for a proposed marijuana business, which never came to fruition. U.S. law prohibits foreign donations to political campaigns.\n\nParnas and Fruman were each charged with two counts of conspiracy, one count of false statements and one of falsification of business records.\n\nTwo other men charged in the marijuana business scheme, Andrey Kukushkin and David Correia, pleaded not guilty last Thursday.", "description": "Two foreign-born Florida businessmen who helped President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani investigate political rival Joe Biden pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to illegally funneling money to a pro-Trump election committee and other politicians.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444063482&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0PY", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
