(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers are the favorites to meet in the World Series for the second time in three years, and for good reason. The American League-leading Astros won 107 games while outscoring their opponents by an MLB-best 280 runs, and boast three aces in Justin Verlander, Gerrit Cole and Zack Greinke. The Dodgers, the National League\u2019s top seed, are led by MVP candidate Cody Bellinger, won 106 games, outscored their opponents by only seven fewer runs than the Astros and are the two-time defending NL champs.\n\nSo why is MLB Network analyst Bill Ripken picking the Nationals to not only beat the Brewers in Tuesday\u2019s NL wild-card game, but then to upset the Dodgers in the NLDS, knock off the Braves in the NLCS and overpower the Astros for their first World Series title?\n\n[With a playoff history full of nightmares, the Nats enter this year with eyes wide open]\n\n\u201cI went out there on a limb,\u201d Ripken, the former Orioles infielder, said in a phone interview of his playoff bracket, which he revealed on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMLB Tonight\u201d postseason special. \u201cIt seemed like it was too easy to pick L.A. and Houston, and I didn\u2019t want to do that. Now, I\u2019m not going to make a statement if I don\u2019t believe it could possibly happen. I had a little feeling, had a little hunch.\u201d\n\nRipken approved of Nationals Manager Dave Martinez\u2019s decision to start Max Scherzer in Tuesday\u2019s winner-take-all game against the Brewers. He said Washington\u2019s path to the World Series begins with Scherzer validating that call, and working deep enough into the game to preserve the Nationals\u2019 other front line starters.\n\n\u201cIf they win the wild-card game and they don\u2019t use either one of [Patrick] Corbin or [Stephen] Strasburg, that sets you up to go out to L.A.,\u201d Ripken said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Strasburg and Corbin, probably in Games 1 and 2, then you\u2019ve got a day off and Mad Max comes back in Game 3. With the three guys they have in Washington, that\u2019s the one team that I was looking at down the playoff stretch that probably could go out there and handle the Dodgers.\u201d\n\nRipken picked the Braves to beat the Cardinals in the NL\u2019s other division series, setting up an all-NL East NLCS.\n\n\u201cThe Nats would have all kinds of mojo going,\u201d Ripken said of a potential matchup with the Braves, who went 11-8 against Washington during the regular season. \u201cThe two guys up at the top of the order, [Trea] Turner and [Adam] Eaton, are playing really well setting the table. I think you can make the argument that the 3-4 [hitters] in D.C. [Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto] are as good as any combination that\u2019s out there in the big leagues. I just like the way the Nationals are playing. They\u2019ve had trouble in postseason, but \u2026 they got on a roll and they played well down the stretch. Why not?\u201d\n\n[Nats and Brewers enter wild-card game with different plans to get 27 outs]\n\nRipken\u2019s prediction isn\u2019t all that far-fetched. Nothing is guaranteed in a five-game series, as the Nationals can attest. Since the second wild-card was introduced in 2012, the top two seeds have met in the World Series only once, in 2013, when the Red Sox beat the Cardinals. The following year, two wild-card teams faced off in the World Series, with the Giants defeating the Royals in seven games. One of the top seeds has advanced to the World Series in each of the last four years.\n\nRipken and Verducci think they know how the #Postseason will go down.

Maybe this is finally the Nationals\u2019 year.\u201d\n\nTwenty-six out of 30 experts pick the Dodgers to win their NLDS matchup, with the other four picking the Nationals. Three experts pick Washington to reach the World Series and one picks the Nationals to win it all. With 19 votes, the Astros are by far the most common pick to win the World Series, followed by the Dodgers (6).\n\nCBS Sports\n\nFour out of five experts pick the Astros to win the World Series and the Nationals to advance to the NLDS before losing to the Dodgers.\n\nThe Athletic\n\nSeven of nine experts pick Washington to survive the Brewers in the wild-card game, but no one has the Nationals upsetting the Dodgers in the NLDS. All nine pick the Astros to win the World Series, with seven pegging the Dodgers as the runner-up.\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nSix of eight experts predict the Dodgers will represent the National League in the World Series, with four picking Los Angeles to win its first title since 1988. Jack Dickey\u2019s bold prediction is, uh, not nice: \u201cThe Nationals will lose at home to the Brewers because of a disastrous performance by their bullpen and fire Dave Martinez after the game.\u201d\n\n538\n\nFive Thirty Eight gives Washington a 64 percent chance to beat the Brewers, a 25 percent chance to beat the Dodgers, a 15 percent chance to reach the World Series and a 6 percent chance to win it all.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nNationals offer Anthony Rendon seven-year deal worth $210-$215 million\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history\n\nThe 12 best moments from the Nationals\u2019 wild 2019 season\n\nRyan Zimmerman is at the end of his deal, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the Nats without him", "description": "MLB Network analyst Bill Ripken likes Washington\u2019s chances against the Dodgers if Max Scherzer pitches well in the wild-card game.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
