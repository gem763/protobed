The musicians had famously dated on and off for several years but RiRi eventually put an end to their romance and she\u2019s now happily dating billionaire businessman Hassan Jameel.\n\nBut it sounds as though they\u2019ve put the past behind them and are back on friendly terms again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA source told E! News: \u2018Rihanna made an appearance and stayed for several hours. She was with two girlfriends and was escorted to Drake\u2019s table by security.\n\n\u2018Her and Drake were talking for a while and were smiling and laughing. It seemed like a very pleasant interaction and they looked like they were having fun together as friends.\u2019\n\nThe awkward moment (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nThe insider reveals it was nothing but good vibes between Drizzy and RiRi, who let her hair down and enjoyed a good ol\u2019 dance in the VIP section.\n\n\u2018Rihanna was dancing to the music and bobbing her head and seemed to be in a good mood. The whole vibe was very chill,\u2019 the eyewitness continued.\n\n\u2018Drake had a huge smile on his face and looked excited to see Rihanna when she arrived.\u2019\n\nIt was the beginning of the end of their close friendship in 2016 when Drake delivered an overly complimentary speech to RiRi while presenting her with the Vanguard Award at the MTV VMAs.\n\nIn the speech, Drake said: \u2018She\u2019s someone I\u2019ve been in love with since I was 22-years-old. She\u2019s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life, I\u2019ve looked up to her, even though she\u2019s younger than me.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s a living, breathing legend in our industry.\u2019\n\nRihanna stood beside him looking visibly uncomfortable and later admitted the awkward moment prompted her to put a distance between them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAddressing their relationship in an interview with Vogue later that year, RiRi said: \u2018We don\u2019t have a friendship now, but we\u2019re not enemies either. It is what it is.\n\n\u2018Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don\u2019t like too many compliments. I don\u2019t like to be put on blast.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
