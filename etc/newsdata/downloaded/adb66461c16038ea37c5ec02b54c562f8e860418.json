I\u2019m using the term partisan in the precise sense, to mean an expression of the views of \u201ca part\u201d of the political community, as opposed to the views of the whole. The kind of cancelation I described above \u2014 about Nazis, Stalinists, violent racists, child molesters, and practitioners of incest and cannibalism \u2014 is affirmed, once again, by nearly everyone on nearly every side of every dispute that divides us as a society. It is transpartisan, an expression of the convictions of almost everyone. It is, for the most part, beyond dispute.\n\nBut today\u2019s \u201ccancel culture\u201d isn\u2019t like that. On the contrary, it\u2019s precisely the lack of an overwhelming consensus in favor of ruling morally out of bounds certain views and actions \u2014 especially about race, gender, and sexual orientation \u2014 that provokes the activists to demand that transgressors against these nascent norms be cast out. The activists have leapt ahead of public opinion, in other words, and are attempting to shape it using tactics derived from street politics and amplified by social media.", "description": "", "authors": ["Damon Linker", "Theweek.Com Articles What-Cancel-Culture-Critics-Wrong"], "top_image": ""}
