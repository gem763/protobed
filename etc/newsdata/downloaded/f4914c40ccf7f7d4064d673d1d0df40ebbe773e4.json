He also runs a foundation \u2013 the Mike Rowe Works Foundation, to provide scholarships to students entering the skilled trades. And he has just written a book, which is also called \u201cThe Way I Heard It.\u201d\n\nSo I was honored this week to have him on \u201cNewt\u2019s World\u201d to talk with me about his personal story of how becoming reconnected with work and skilled labor changed his life forever.\n\nMIKE ROWE URGES BUSINESS OWNERS TO HIRE VETERANS: 'THERE'S NO GOOD REASON NOT TO'\n\nWhen Mike was young, he idolized his grandfather, who was a master tradesman. As Mike told me, his grandfather could build a house without blueprints and fix or create virtually anything.\n\nMike grew up believing that he, too, would grow up to build things and follow his family trade. However, as he put it, \u201cthe handy gene is recessive.\u201d When he reached his early 20s, Mike realized he did not have the natural talent required to do what his grandfather did, and so he went to community college, university, and later entered the media/entertainment industry.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHowever, a single call from his mother concerning his grandfather\u2019s health changed Mike\u2019s life in fundamental ways and set him on his current course. It still colors nearly everything he does.\n\nI hope you will listen to this week\u2019s episode, because Mike shared with me the touching story about how \u201cDirty Jobs\u201d came into existence. It was initially Mike\u2019s homage to his grandfather, but it turned into a profound and deep respect for all people who work hard every day to help our civilization function.\n\nBut this was just one story that Mike shared with me. He also talked about his high school chorus teacher (who was also a Golden Gloves boxer) who cured Mike of a stutter by forcing him to audition for theater. He told me how that ultimately led him to fake his way into the Baltimore Opera (yes, Mike also sings opera).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis was one of the most fascinating episodes I have recorded. Mike was incredibly candid, and we had an interesting conversation about how we as a society have lost our connection with skilled labor and trades.\n\nLabor Day is the perfect time for us to reflect and join Mike\u2019s effort to reconnect and fix our relationship with work. It\u2019s also the perfect day to pause and appreciate the millions of people who get up every day to keep America (and the world) running.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "Labor Day is the perfect time for us to reflect and join Mike Rowe's effort to fix our relationship with work.", "authors": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Mike-Rowe-headshot.jpg"}
