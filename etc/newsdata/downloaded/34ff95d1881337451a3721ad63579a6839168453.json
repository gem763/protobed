We are using every available diplomatic and economic tool to disrupt these operations.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcement came a day after the administration leveled sanctions against Iran\u2019s space agency for the first time, asserting that the agency is developing ballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. mandates under the guise of a civilian program to launch satellites into orbit.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
