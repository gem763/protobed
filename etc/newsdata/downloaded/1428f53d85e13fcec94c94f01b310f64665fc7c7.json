The budget must then be approved by Italy\u2019s parliament before the end of the year.\n\nDespite rising debt and a stagnating economy, Conte\u2019s government has promised a mildly expansionary budget that would see the country\u2019s structural deficit -- which strips off one-off measures -- slightly widen in 2020 before narrowing again in coming years.\n\nThe draft plans include scrapping an extra fixed fee to be paid by patients which will result in increased funds being needed for the national health system, changes to the pension system, two funds for state and regional investments and more resources for industrial innovation.\n\nItaly\u2019s fiscal plans are under intense scrutiny given the country\u2019s outsized debt.\n\nThe country\u2019s public debt increased to 138% of gross domestic product in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg calculations based on new data released by the Bank of Italy on Tuesday. That\u2019s just under the high of 138.8% reached in the second quarter of 2015.\n\nStill, investors have been scooping up Italian debt, driving down yields amid optimism over the European Central Bank\u2019s new stimulus effort and the expectation that budget negotiations with the European Union will be smooth.\n\nLast year, Italy\u2019s populist government -- also led by Conte but supported by a different coalition -- twice narrowly avoided EU censure over its spending plans, after tense standoffs that push up yields on Italy\u2019s bonds and raised investor concerns over debt sustainability.", "description": "Italian Government Approves Draft 2020 Budget Plans for Europe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic1a5c002d2a40ef0bc5e8e578d88a373c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
