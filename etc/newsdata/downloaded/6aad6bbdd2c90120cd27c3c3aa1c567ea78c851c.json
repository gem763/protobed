Throughout my life, he has been the greatest support for me when I needed it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pride goes both ways as Jad is also extremely delighted with his son\u2019s choice of profession.\n\nSader added: \u2018It\u2019s possible to see when his eyes are filled with joy and satisfaction as if to express: \u201cyes, I have Down\u2019s syndrome, but I raised this man and did everything in my power to make him become a doctor and help others\u201d.\u2019\n\nIn most cases, Down\u2019s Syndrome is not inherited as it\u2019s caused by a one-off genetic change in the sperm or egg.\n\nAccording to the Down\u2019s Syndrome society, if one parent has it, there is a 35% to 50% chance that the child may inherit the condition.\n\nMost men with the condition can\u2019t have children while some women may be able to, making Sader and Jad\u2019s story even more special.\n\nSader spoke to Metro.co.uk about some of the comments he gets from people about his mum and dad, who are still together.\n\n\u2018One of the concerns people have is how can a woman who doesn\u2019t have Down\u2019s Syndrome marry a man with DS?\u2019\n\n\u2018I believe if the two partners were on the same page then why not get married? They are intellectually suitable for each other; very simple but loving and caring people.\u2019\n\nMost men with the condition are infertile (Picture: @saderissa)\n\nAnother comment Sader often gets is the rarity of seeing a dad with DS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When people search Google they find that men with Down\u2019s Syndrome (DS) are infertile so they get confused when they hear about us,\u2019 he explained.\n\n\u2018I know six more cases of fathers with DS and the studies that show the fertility of men with DS are very few so we cannot say these men are fertile that easily.\u2019\n\nHe wants other people with DS to know that while it might be rare, it is still possible to have a family.\n\n\u2018We really appreciate hundreds of parents who have reached out to me and told me that we gave them hope for a better future for their kids,\u2019 he added.\n\nJad is a huge part of the Syrian community (Picture: @saderissa)\n\nThe chances of a child having DS are even higher where both parents have Down\u2019s syndrome.\n\nThere is also a high chance that pregnancy would end in miscarriage.\n\nWomen with Down\u2019s syndrome are also more likely than other women to have a premature baby, or to need a caesarian section.\n\nSome may choose not to have children or not be sexually active.\n\nMORE: 78-year-old becomes UK\u2019s oldest man with Down\u2019s syndrome\n\nMORE: Parents of kids with Down\u2019s syndrome are the lucky few\n\nMORE: World\u2019s longest Down\u2019s syndrome marriage stronger than ever after 27 years\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Syrian student Sader Issa who is training to be a dentist was raised by a dad who has Down's Syndrome.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90261963_1571563284.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
