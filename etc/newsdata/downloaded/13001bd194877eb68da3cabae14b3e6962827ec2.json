Photo: New York Magazine\n\nCarmen Maria Machado\u2019s second book, In the Dream House is unlikely to resemble anything you\u2019ve read before. It\u2019s both a memoir of her toxic relationship with her first girlfriend and a history of queer domestic violence with chapters that dance between genres. Some read like fairy tales, others like horror stories; there\u2019s a choose-your-own-adventure section. While her story will resonate deeply with some, others may feel that whatever Machado says her ex-girlfriend subjected her to (manipulation, deceit, screaming rages) didn\u2019t rise to the level of abuse. Machado is well aware of this. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d she told me. As she showed in her dazzling 2017 debut, the story collection Her Body and Other Parties, she explores subjects many would rather avoid. \u201cI speak into the silence,\u201d she writes in the new book. \u201cI toss the stone of my story into a vast crevice; measure the emptiness by its small sound.\u201d\n\nYour first book, Her Body and Other Parties, was a huge success; now, there\u2019s a TV adaptation in the works. How did it change your life?\n\nBefore the first book came out, I was just trying to gain purchase in my career in various ways. The success of the book really surprised me. It still does. Every week, there are like 200 or 300 copies sold, and it\u2019s been out for two years now. It gave me space to be an artist. It got me to a place that I thought I would not be in for a long time. It made me able to live a life I want to live.\n\nWhy did you want to do a memoir as your second book?\n\n[Laughs dryly.] I don\u2019t know that I necessarily did. When I was editing Her Body and Other Parties, Graywolf [my publisher] asked if I had anything else for them to look at. I thought the draft was really a mess \u2014 it was so disjointed, obviously unfinished \u2014 but my agent thought we could sell it. He could see the finished thing in the skeletal draft.\n\nPhoto: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images\n\nThe book is such a wild mixture of genres and forms. It\u2019s grounded in your memories, but also weaves in historical episodes of queer domestic violence and fairy-tale tropes. What was the editing process like?\n\nWhen I first handed it to my editor, it wasn\u2019t in any discernible order. The personal material was in a rough chronological arc, but that was about it. I would just go off on these kicks, like, \u201cHere\u2019s a huge chunk of historical material.\u201d I knew it needed to be spread out, but I didn\u2019t even know how to begin. Eventually, I just asked my editor if he could do it for me, and he did.\n\nWhy do you think you couldn\u2019t put it into order?\n\nI was really exhausted and sad. I [had] also never worked on a full-length book before. [My wife] Val told me how an old writing teacher of hers used to say writing a full-length book is like falling into a bowl of spaghetti. You\u2019re trying to pull all the noodles together but it\u2019s really hard because you\u2019re just in this bowl of noodles.\n\nWhat was it like to write about something so personal and so dark as your first full-length book?\n\nIt was horrible. It made me more depressed and kind of killed a little part of me. I was sitting alone in a little cabin in New Mexico trying to write about the worst thing that ever happened to me. I thought I was ready to write the book, and I don\u2019t know if I was but I did it. If I said it was a good experience, I\u2019d be lying. It was not a good experience at all.\n\nHow did you keep going?\n\nI didn\u2019t want to give the money back.\n\nPractical.\n\nI also thought, Well, I could have taken more time with it. But then I would\u2019ve spent more time with it, and I wanted the work to be done. That\u2019s my personality. I had a foot surgery this summer, and I had to do one on the other foot too. I asked my doctors, \u201cCan you do both feet at the same time?\u201d They were like, \u201cNo, that would be terrible.\u201d\n\nDid you at least feel that, by the end, you had exorcised something?\n\nI think so, in the sense that I\u2019d been trying to write about this for a really long time and I\u2019d mostly not succeeded. I\u2019m proud of this book, but it also made me think about stuff I could have done differently. In that sense, I\u2019m not exorcised, because the ghost is still there. It\u2019s still present, it\u2019s just contained. I don\u2019t know, the metaphor\u2019s getting away from me.\n\nThat makes me think of your idea in the book about the theory of time travel, that even if you could go back, you couldn\u2019t actually change anything.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I can do except tell the story. I try not to have explicit social goals for my work, but I\u2019ve already gotten messages from people telling me they have experienced similar things that they\u2019ve never seen represented before. Queer domestic violence is not a topic that\u2019s been written about a lot.\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nI think this is one of the failures of the conversation around #MeToo. People really struggle because they want these super-concrete examples. It\u2019d be easy to say my girlfriend was actually a boyfriend, and she \u2014 he \u2014 gave me a black eye, here\u2019s a photo, here\u2019s the police report. It\u2019s way more complicated to say, what does it mean for somebody to psychologically torture? Can women abuse other women? Of course they can, but what does that look like, and why does it matter, and what kind of betrayal does that feel like?\n\nYou\u2019ve always been interested in the murkier regions of #MeToo.\n\nThat is always my project. How do we think about coercion and sexism as it exists in more subtle ways? We like to think of #MeToo as these perfect open-and-shut cases of, like, Aha! He pushed a button and locked the door behind her. Not to bring up fucking Jeffrey Epstein, but literally that\u2019s the stuff that movies are made of. I\u2019m more interested in the stuff that\u2019s not so easy to name. I\u2019m interested in trying to give people language to talk about things they don\u2019t think they have the language to talk about. Is it the most noble of pursuits? I don\u2019t know. You tell me.\n\nHas anyone challenged the idea that your emotional suffering was abuse?\n\nNot yet. I feel like it\u2019s inevitable. People have already said that to me about the experience itself \u2014 people that I actually cared about. Or people who were supposed to protect me and help me.\n\nAnyone in particular come to mind?\n\nThere was this person in an administrative capacity at Iowa [Writers\u2019 Workshop]. My ex was coming to school there, and I tried to explain to [the administrator] what had happened to me. She told me, \u201cSometimes relationships are just bad.\u201d After, I remember sobbing and thinking, This is what people will always think. The idea of people I respected thinking I was just some weird, hysterical scorned lover \u2014 it was unbearable. Maybe that did play into why I decided to write the book. This feeling that if I don\u2019t, nobody will ever understand.\n\nWhat do you think you wanted from that administrator?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I know what I wanted. I think I thought, very na\u00efvely, I am a student here, if I tell somebody and try to explain this, I will be helped in some way. What I didn\u2019t realize was that that\u2019s not what institutions are for. I\u2019ve learned better now. Institutions are not designed to help individual people. They\u2019re designed to maintain their own longevity.\n\nI spend a lot of time talking to my students about this \u2014 how institutions exist to preserve their own power, and they will only act if they are really pushed into a corner where that power is threatened. I tell them, \u201cYes, the world is full of good people, but it\u2019s also full of people who will think nothing of crumpling you up into a little ball.\u201d\n\nHow do your students receive that information from you?\n\nThey laugh nervously. I want to save all of them from something, and I can\u2019t. I want to tell them that relationships are hard, but if your significant other throws something at your general direction, even if it doesn\u2019t hit you, that\u2019s fucked up. If someone touches you without your permission, even if it\u2019s someone you\u2019re in a relationship with, and you tell them not to and they keep doing it, that\u2019s not okay. Everybody cries in relationships, but if you\u2019re crying every single day of every week of every month, that\u2019s not normal. But I can\u2019t walk around saying that to everybody, so I wrote a book.\n\nYou write quite a bit about your sexual relationship with your ex, especially at the beginning of the relationship. I\u2019m curious how you think your attraction to her played into your willingness to stay, even once things got bad.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t my first female lover, but she was my first girlfriend, and we had a deeply sexually compatible relationship. No one had made me feel that way before. Like \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful and special and I love you and I wanna have sex with you.\u201d There\u2019s no point in denying that it\u2019s really intoxicating. Especially when you\u2019re a fat chick who\u2019s been told, maybe implicitly, that you\u2019re not somebody worth desiring. I was like, Wow, I can have that, this thing I\u2019ve always wanted. It was a perfectly Carmen-shaped hole, and I fell right into it.\n\nI think about my own naked desire. That\u2019s not even about her, it\u2019s about me \u2014 what I needed, and how nakedly I needed it, and how easily I was lured, like it was nothing, like you\u2019d lure a dog with a little scrap of garbage, like it\u2019s not even a steak. That\u2019s humiliating to think about; it\u2019s humiliating to write that; it\u2019s humiliating to remember it.\n\nWhy do you think it\u2019s humiliating to think about that desire?\n\n[Long pause.] I don\u2019t know. I guess because I\u2019m gonna have to stand in front of people and say, \u201clook at me, I wanted this thing, and I wanted it so badly that I gave up almost everything I was and almost destroyed myself in the process to get it.\u201d\n\nHave you had you had any contact with her? Does she know you\u2019re publishing this book about your relationship with her?\n\nI cannot speak to that either way.\n\nDo you feel prepared for all these thorny issues to come up on your tour, or on Twitter, or in books reviews?\n\nI\u2019m prepared for it. At least, I feel prepared for other people to have that conversation. I don\u2019t have to have that conversation with anybody. I wrote the book, you know? I\u2019ve had my half of the conversation. Besides, by now, there\u2019s nothing anyone could say that I have never thought.\n\nIn the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado is out November 5 on Graywolf Press.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
