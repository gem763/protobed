A Republican loss in any of the elections could give the president\u2019s detractors ammunition to argue that he\u2019s politically weakened as he heads into a treacherous 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cMississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana are states where Republicans can win races for governor. Those would be big momentum wins for President Trump heading into 2020, but in the unlikely event we lose in all those states it would clearly be a troubling sign that the president would have to overcome,\u201d said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member and the nephew of former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour.\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump has been quizzing aides and allies on the three contests and been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) about Bevin\u2019s reelection fight. He also speaks regularly with Bevin, a longtime ally and frequent visitor to the White House.\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin. | Mark Humphrey/AP Photo\n\nThe Trump political operation is mobilizing. The RNC, which works closely with the president's team, is expected to spend millions on a get-out-the-vote effort across the three battlegrounds. Chris Carr, the Trump campaign's political director and a Louisiana native, has become increasingly involved in the state\u2019s gubernatorial contest.\n\nYet none are sure bets for the president. Republicans face formidable candidates in each state \u2014 and especially in Louisiana, where popular Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards is seeking reelection. Bevin is one of the least popular governors in the country. And in Mississippi, Republican nominee Tate Reeves, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, has been criticized for his lackluster campaign skills and is recovering from an unexpectedly tough primary.\n\nRepublicans have never won all three states in the same year, despite the conservative tilt of each.\n\nThe White House has calculated that Trump is likely to take the brunt of the blame for a loss whether he campaigns or not. So he's decided to jump in head-first so he can take credit if Republicans win.\n\nTrump is popular in all three states, and his team is convinced he can pull each Republican candidate over the finish line. In Mississippi, the president is so well-liked that the Democratic candidate, state Attorney General Jim Hood, has made a Trump-like promise to \u201c drain the swamp.\u201d\n\nThe president is already talking up his role in positive developments. After Edwards failed to hit 50 percent in the Oct. 12 primary and was forced into a November runoff, Trump claimed that the Louisiana Democrat\u2019s popularity had been driven down because \u201cI explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president \u2014 and his base \u2014 enjoys his boasting during these \u2018winning\u2019 narrative opportunities. Maybe that helps keep the national GOP base energized heading into the holidays, a likely prolonged impeachment slog, and peak Democratic presidential primary season,\u201d said Nick Everhart, a Republican strategist who has worked on an array of governor\u2019s races. \u201cAny morsel to take credit and feed the base is important for enthusiasm and fundraising over the coming months.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump during a rally in Louisiana. | Matt Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe swing will also enable the president to do something he relishes: Attack his rivals before a crowd of adoring supporters. During a rally in Louisiana earlier this month, he accused Democrats of pursuing an \u201cunconstitutional, bullshit impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tend to agree that getting him out there is the correct posture for them,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Kentucky-based Republican strategist who served as a top political aide in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cBeing in a crouch, hiding under the desk \u2014 I think that would be a bad sign.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have been worried about the races for months but have grown optimistic in recent weeks. They believe the House Democratic-led impeachment push has reinvigorated conservative voters who dominate each state. Recently completed voter modeling conducted by the Republican National Committee in Kentucky, for instance, showed Bevin leading by 3 percentage points. He had trailed Democratic state attorney general Andy Beshear since April in the committee\u2019s previous findings in the race.\n\nEach of the Republican candidates are seizing on impeachment. Bevin recently held a press conference in front of the state Capitol to call on Beshear to say whether he supports impeachment. Louisiana's Republican nominee, businessman Eddie Rispone, cut a web video in which he accused Edwards of being part of a Democratic Party \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Reeves has taken to Twitter to claim that Hood once supported impeachment-backer Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cI think there is some evidence that impeachment has helped increase Republican intensity. And in low turnout races, which is what we have, that is incredibly important,\u201d said Phil Cox, a former executive director of the Republican Governors Association.\n\nMuch of the party\u2019s focus is on saving Bevin. Trump attended a fundraiser for Bevin in Kentucky in August, the only time this year the president has raised money for a candidate other than himself. Pence has appeared with Bevin, as has Donald Trump Jr. Republican groups are poised to spend over $3 million on TV ads during the final weeks of the race, over $700,000 more than what Democrats plan to drop.\n\nThe all-out effort to lift Bevin was encouraged by McConnell, a former Bevin rival who himself is up for reelection next year. In conversations with Trump and RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the Senate GOP leader lobbied for resources to be directed to the Kentucky race and made the case it would get outsized attention because it was one of the few high-profile elections this year.\n\nDemocrats are also investing heavily in the three races. But with time running out, Democrats are trying to tamp down expectations for themselves, while putting the onus on Republicans.\n\n\u201cThese are three deep-red areas,\u201d said Democratic Governors Association spokesman David Turner, \u201cthat should be easy lay-ups for Republicans.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/79/c8/568dee314af1869a49157b54dbba/191021-trump-bevin-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
