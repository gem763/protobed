And we will select the appropriate options as a response to the attacks against the kingdom,\" he said.\n\nFrance, Germany and Britain this week said they agreed with US findings that Iran was responsible for the air strikes on the Abqaiq plant and the Khurais oil field which knocked out half of Saudi Arabia's oil production.\n\nIran denies responsibility for the attacks, which have been claimed by Yemen's Iranian-backed Huthi rebels.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani, interviewed on Tuesday by Fox News, said that US intelligence may have been confused by an inscription on the weapons identified with Shia Islam.
