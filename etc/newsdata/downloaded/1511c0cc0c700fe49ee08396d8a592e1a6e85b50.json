And if you fail to do either one of those you will struggle as a retailer,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 14: People gather at a newly opened Starbucks' Reserve Roasteries in the Meatpacking District on on December 14, 2018 in New York City.

We've transformed the focus on beverages away from these limited-time offerings to more of our core beverages. We've reimagined happy hours in our stores,\" Johnson told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cThat has amplified Starbucks as a destination in many ways for millennials,\u201d he added. \u201cLook at the fact that over 50 percent of our beverages are now cold beverages,\u201d citing key offerings like cold brew and Nitro.\n\nAnd while these young consumers are coming to the stores, the digital is just as important, he explained. Specifically, the increase in mobile app users has been a driver of growth for Starbucks.\n\nDuring the last quarter, Johnson noted that the Starbucks Rewards daily active members reached 17.2 million in the U.S., a 14% jump from a year ago. The program has been a critical driver for the coffee company's closely-watched comparable store sales growth, accounting for 42% of tender in U.S. stores.\n\nIn fact, the company's digitally-savvy customers visit the stores more often and spend more.\n\n\"That's allowing us to personalize their experience, personalized the recommendations we give to them and it's that combination of the experience in the store and that digital relationship that is driving our business,\" Johnson said.\n\nSince Johnson took over in April 2017, shares of Starbucks have gained nearly 64%. The stock is up more than 50% since the beginning of this year.\n\nMark your calendar. More\n\n\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
