Once the state-run channel had made that decision, online streaming partner Tencent had little choice but to follow suit.\n\nAdmittedly, preseason games don't quite get pulses racing in the way that regular season games do, but this has become something of a tradition in China, where basketball rivals football as the country's most loved sport.\n\nNBA teams have played in front of Chinese fans in 13 of the past 14 years, with LeBron James - unquestionably the biggest name still active in the league - set to lead his Lakers in Shanghai and Shenzhen this week against the Nets, whose new owner Joe Tsai co-founded Chinese tech giant Alibaba.\n\nBasketball in China is almost as old as the game itself and Chairman Mao was known to be a big fan.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption LeBron is a massive star in China\n\nBut the sport took a great leap forward once Yao Ming joined the Rockets in 2002. Yao played the bulk of seven seasons in Houston from 2002-09, before finally retiring after two more injury-plagued years.\n\nDuring that time, his popularity with fans saw him named to the All-Star team eight times - even during periods when he barely played - firmly establishing the Rockets as \"China's team\".\n\nIt's also big business\n\nHowever, the backlash to Mr Morey's ill-fated social media post has been so strong that Houston has quickly lost that mantle.\n\nMeanwhile, Rockets merchandise has been cleared from various e-commerce platforms in China, while almost every Chinese sponsor of the league, plus others associated directly with the team, have suspended those partnerships.\n\nAccurate statistics in a country of 1.4 billion people are notoriously hard to come by, and the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA)'s claim that 300 million Chinese play the sport is wildly optimistic.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The NBA's largest store outside North America is in Beijing\n\nBut the country still has millions of basketball fans, making China a clear number two market for the NBA, behind only the US.\n\nAnd for a society that doesn't have a long history of paying for online content, Tencent's five-year streaming deal that puts an estimated $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) in NBA coffers is far ahead of anything else in the sporting landscape here.\n\nIn other words, China matters.\n\nThe crisis playbook vs free speech\n\nWe've seen similar incidents with foreign entities play out in China previously. Dolce & Gabbana, Marriott, Delta Airlines and others have all fallen foul of consumer sentiment in recent years for an ad, post or oversight that was perceived in China as a slight on the country.\n\nThe crisis playbook then follows a familiar pattern: the foreign brand in question issues an apology, keeps a low profile and tries to work its way back into the good graces of those consumers.\n\nBut this time it's different.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear he will not apologise for Mr Morey's tweet, citing the American league's values of \"equality, respect and freedom of expression\".\n\nHe has some leverage here. If consumers are annoyed with a fashion brand, hotel or airline, they can easily switch to another option; but the NBA stands apart in China.\n\nThe CBA is a supplementary, complementary league, but in no way is it ready to replace the NBA as the league of choice for Chinese fans.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Adam Silver insists on the league's values of \"equality, respect and freedom of expression\"\n\nClaims that basketball fans might instead follow another sport are also off the mark.\n\nThe impact of this controversy is two-fold. The NBA's regular season starts on 22 October, and the hope is that the dust will have settled by then, and the league broadcast partners can return to regular programming - albeit with Houston Rockets games kept offline for at least a few more months.\n\nIt's still possible, though, that China doubles down on its call for an official apology, meaning that the situation could escalate still further and the broadcast ban extend into the regular season - though if that does happen, enterprising fans will likely find a way to access pirated live-streams from overseas.\n\nBetween a rock and hard place\n\nBut, more importantly, the risk of a backlash back home for companies operating in China is becoming greater.\n\nWith consumers in the West now hearing about the demands placed on those firms in China, the companies - already acutely aware of the political minefields that lie in wait - will have to weigh their moves in the East with the reception those moves get back in the West.\n\nAnd as the NBA has found this week, it's becoming nigh on impossible to strike a balance between those two very different sides, even with carefully-worded statements.\n\nSome may choose to pick sides and prioritise one market over another for a variety of different reasons, while the majority will do their very best to continue the high-wire act and stay out of trouble in the first place.\n\nBut with online mobs all over the world amplifying every perceived misstep, expect to see more companies stuck between a rock and hard place in the future.\n\nMark Dreyer has been covering the sports industry in China since 2007 and runs the China Sports Insider website.
