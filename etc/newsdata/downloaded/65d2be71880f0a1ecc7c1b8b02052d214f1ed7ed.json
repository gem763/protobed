His administration has taken an ax to a slew of environmental regulations meant to curb greenhouse gas emissions \u2015 all part of its so-called \u201cenergy dominance\u201d agenda.\n\nThunberg spent most of the rally surrounded by peers and a throng of reporters wielding cameras. She quietly joined a series of chants, and when finally given a chance to speak, simply expressed her gratitude for such a large turnout.\n\n\u201cThis is very overwhelming,\u201d she said. \u201cNever give up. We will continue.\u201d\n\nNICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images Greta Thunberg speaks at a climate protest outside the White House.\n\nThunberg rose to fame last year when she went on strike from school following Sweden\u2019s hottest summer on record. For weeks, she sat outside her country\u2019s Parliament, holding a \u201cSchool strike for climate\u201d sign and demanding that local politicians enact policies in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate action.\n\nSchool strikes quickly popped up in other countries. And in March, an estimated 1.4 million young people in more than 100 countries mobilized for a global strike, part of what has come to be known as the Fridays for Future movement. Tuesday\u2019s gathering outside the White House comes ahead of a weeklong global strike slated for the week of Sept. 20.\n\nThunberg traveled to the United States by sailboat to reduce her carbon footprint. While in the United States, she\u2019s expected to testify before Congress, speak outside the U.S. Supreme Court alongside youth suing the government over climate change, and attend the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.", "description": "\"Never give up.\" The teenage climate activist joined hundreds of other young protesters on Friday to demand global action on climate change.", "authors": ["Environment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bd6053b00002b88d285c0.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
