Nalley says he's received \"little or no response from teams about an opportunity for Colin.\"\n\nIn February, Kaepernick and former 49ers teammate Eric Reid reached an agreement on a collusion grievance they had filed against the NFL. Reid later signed a three-year contract with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nColin Kaepernick, right, and Eric Reid kneel during the national anthem before a San Francisco 49ers-Carolina Panthers game on Sept. 18, 2016.

But despite a rash of quarterback injuries hitting teams this season, he remains unemployed.\n\nIn the press release, Nalley points out that Kaepernick has never demanded a specific salary from an NFL team in order to sign, and that he \"has the same skill set as many of the young mobile quarterbacks flourishing in the NFL right now.\"\n\nKaepernick played six seasons with the 49ers, leading them to two NFC championship games and Super Bowl XLVII, which they lost to the Baltimore Ravens. He has 13 career rushing touchdowns, 72 TD passes and 30 interceptions.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
