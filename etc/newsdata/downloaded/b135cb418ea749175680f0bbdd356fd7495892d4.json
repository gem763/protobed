Cast: Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, Zoey Deutch, Bill Murray, Luke Wilson, Rosario Dawson, Thomas Middleditch, Avan Jogia. 15 cert, 99 mins\n\nFans of Bill Murray\u2019s cameo in Zombieland (2009) \u2013 he played himself during an undead apocalypse, alive but covered in mottled make-up to fit in \u2013 have a late-arriving treat in Zombieland: Double Tap as the end credits roll. Spoilerphobes beware: it\u2019s a flashback to the moment when things got weird, which appears to have happened during Murray\u2019s press junket for (the fictitious) Garfield 3: Flabby Tabby.\n\nThe standalone sequence \u2013 think furball cough requests in different languages \u2013 must have taken at least a full day to shoot. It\u2019s custom-built to tickle jaded film journos, given that many of us are well-used to sitting around in office suites for whole afternoons, hoping to strike effortful gold during a seven-minute conversation with a fatigued and/or borderline-suicidal celebrity. It\u2019s broad, it\u2019s easy, and it hits the spot.\n\nThe only downside is wading through this nakedly gratuitous sequel, directed again by Ruben (Venom) Fleischer, to get to it. Ten years on, the reunion of the first film\u2019s poster quartet \u2013 Harrelson, Eisenberg, Stone, Breslin \u2013 feels motivated by little but boosted star power (it helped propel all the younger actors to fame) and various agents getting a bigger cut.\n\nThe four of them \u2013 two sisters who don\u2019t come across as related, a surrogate dad, and Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s survival nerd \u2013 are still mooching around America\u2019s ravaged back yard, camping out in all the biggest abandoned homes they can find (the White House, Graceland, etc) and packing enough firepower to obliterate any zombies (\u201czees\u201d, they annoyingly say) who still cross their path.", "description": "Dir:", "authors": ["Tim Robey", "Film Critic", "Julie Burchill", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000212998545-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
