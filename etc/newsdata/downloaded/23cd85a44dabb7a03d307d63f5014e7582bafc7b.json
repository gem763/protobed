London's FTSE\n\nfutures were, however, a tad higher.\n\nChinese shares were in the red, with Shanghai's SSE\n\nComposite stumbling 1.5% while the blue-chip index\n\nwas down 1.65%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index was 0.8% weaker after a\n\nweekend of sometimes violent protests that saw pro-democracy\n\nactivists vandalise a railway station and shopping mall.\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI ended flat after spending most\n\nof the day in negative territory following disappointing trade\n\ndata while Australian and New Zealand shares bucked the trend to\n\nfinish 0.3% and 0.4% higher, respectively.\n\nThat left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares\n\noutside Japan down 0.2% at 510.04 points. It is\n\nstill up more than 3% so far in September.\n\n\"There are real concerns about the impact on economies from\n\nthe trade dispute,\" said Michael McCarthy, Sydney-based\n\nstrategist at CMC Markets. \"People are probably getting an idea\n\nthat this will be a long negotiation. And the longer it lingers\n\nthe more impact it will have economically.\"\n\nDespite the weakness in Asia, E-mini futures for U.S. S&P\n\n500 and the Dow climbed nearly 0.4% each.\n\nOver the weekend, the U.S. Trade Representative's office\n\nissued a brief statement characterising the two days of talks\n\nwith China as \"productive.\" It added that a principal-level\n\ntrade meeting in Washington would take place in October, as\n\npreviously planned. China's Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described\n\nthe talks as \"constructive\", and said they had also had a good\n\ndiscussion on \"detailed arrangements\" for the high-level talks\n\nin October.\n\nAdditionally, the United States removed tariffs from more\n\nthan 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S.\n\ncompanies.\n\nDespite the improved tone, markets still remain unconvinced\n\nabout the possibility of an imminent deal.\n\nInvestors were rattled by news on Friday that Chinese\n\nofficials unexpectedly cancelled a visit to U.S. farms this week\n\nfollowing their two days of negotiations in Washington.\n\nOne Shanghai-based analyst at Tebon Securities said the\n\ncancellation had hit investor sentiment and could be a major\n\ndrag on Chinese A-shares in the near term.\n\nNews that five Yemeni civilians were killed in air strikes\n\nby the Saudi-led coalition further soured investor appetite.\n\nSHOCK\n\nMideast tensions and worries about oil supplies lifted Brent\n\ncrude futures 1.26%, or 81 cents, to $65.09 a barrel,\n\nwhile U.S. crude futures rose 1.17%, or 68 cents, to\n\n$58.77 a barrel. O/R\n\nThe Pentagon has ordered additional troops to be deployed in\n\nthe Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia's air and missile\n\ndefences following an attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the\n\nadditional troops are for \"deterrence and defence\" and\n\nWashington aimed to avoid war with Iran.\n\nMarkets will closely watch September manufacturing activity\n\nsurveys due from the United States and European Union later in\n\nthe day for any signs of a rebound.\n\nAction in currency markets was muted.\n\nThe dollar gained 0.15% against the safe haven Japanese yen\n\nto 107.71 after easing 0.5% last week. The risk-sensitive\n\nAustralian dollar AUD=D3 was up 0.19% at $0.6776.\n\nThe euro EUR=D3 and the British pound were barely\n\nchanged, leaving the dollar index mostly flat at 98.471\n\nagainst a basket of six major currencies.\n\nAsia stock markets https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nAsia-Pacific valuations https://tmsnrt.rs/2Dr2BQA\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares ease on geopolitical tensions, oil up 1%", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA7L0F3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
