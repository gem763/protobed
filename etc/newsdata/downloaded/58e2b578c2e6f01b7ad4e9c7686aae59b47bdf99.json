Nic Walker\n\nHarvey Norman's latest 1-for-17 capital-raise fell $7.8 million short of its $174 million target, despite being issued at an extraordinary 46 per cent discount to the market price during the offer period.\n\nThis has been well-canvassed. But one aspect that hasn't been examined is precisely what that shortfall was worth to executive chairman Gerry Harvey. A detail we can now glean from his directors' interest notice, filed on Monday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Harvey took up his full entitlement to 5.6 million ordinary shares, taking his total direct and indirect holdings to 391.5 million shares. That's 31.42 per cent of the company.\n\nLast month's annual report had him owning 31.34 per cent. So courtesy of some investors not taking up the cheap shares on offer, he's added another 0.08 per cent to his stake. That much of the company, at Harvey Norman's current market capitalisation, would normally cost some $4.1 million.\n\nHad the offer been underwritten, it wouldn't have worked out so advantageously for the company's founder. But doing things the traditional way would mean financial institutions would be the ones creeping up the register. We know how much Gerry hates the thought of that.", "description": "He's added another 0.08 per cent to his stake, which under normal circumstances would cost $4.1 million.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7358%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_171/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2a84509d5b7f4f2cefaa4c45a81380ab63ba9651", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
