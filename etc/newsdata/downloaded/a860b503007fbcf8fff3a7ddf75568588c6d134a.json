his name (Picture: Getty)\n\nEngland blunted a potentially dangerous Argentina side with an impressive 39-10 victory in Tokyo, scoring six tries in their toughest test of the tournament so far to book their place in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe first quarter was an entertaining contest, the Pumas playing with their tournament on the line, punctuated by a Jonny May try, but it was a heavy hit to the head of Owen Farrell that changed the game.\n\nTomas Lavanini was sent off for a clear dangerous tackle and once the extra man started to take its toll, Elliot Daly, Ben Youngs and George Ford profited to secure a try-scoring bonus point that had a little of the shine taken off by Matias Moroni\u2019s late score.\n\nHowever, they would finish on a high as Jack Nowell confirmed his return from injury by shrugging off four defenders to score in the corner and fellow replacement Luke Cowan-Dickie followed a rolling maul over the try-line to complete the rout.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a rabble-rousing depature from the dressing room, with replacements chanting and jumping around in the tunnel, Argentina produced a strong start and a kick in behind had May sprinting back to sweep up, forced to concede a five-metre scrum.\n\nEngland back-pedaled and conceded a penalty to allow Benjamin Urdapilleta a simple kick to open the scoring, but it did not last long as the 2003 champions hit back immediately.\n\nA clever grubber kick from Daly which led to an England lineout was followed by a typically powerful maul, and a textbook blindside two-on-two drill from Ford and try-scorer May.\n\nArgentina were always likely to bring fire and fury \u2013 replacement hooker Agustin Creevy had called them boring during the week \u2013 and those emotions boiled over in just the 12th minute after a late hit on Youngs with Tom Curry and Farrell jumping to their scrum-half\u2019s defence.\n\nReferee Nigel Owens felt it was nothing more than a penalty but six minutes later, he was forced to go to his pocket by a high tackle from Lavanini.\n\nOwen Farrell was hit high by Tomas Lavanini in the first half (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe second row initially got away with the shot on Farrell but Owens asked the TMO to look at it and the very first replay made it clear he had hit the inside-centre\u2019s head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Rugby World Cup\u2019s fifth red card did not appear to dampen Argentina at first but the exhausting effect of being a man short started to hurt as half-time drew near.\n\nMay made two breaks to give them good field position and after several phases on the try-line were held up, Youngs chose to go wide and after a brief fumble, Daly recovered to run in England\u2019s second try of the game.\n\nWith the gong having sounded for half-time, Farrell gave England a final opportunity to hurt the 14 men in blue and white with a fine kick into the corner and eventually they made it pay, scrum-half Youngs diving over from close range to end the half.\n\nOne concern for Jones at half-time will have come from what followed all three tries \u2013 a missed kick from Farrell, who reached the break scoreless despite three opportunities from the kicking tee.\n\nElliot Daly was one of those backs who benefited from England\u2019s extra man (Picture: Getty)\n\nHe was given the chance to atone for his misses early in the second half when heavy carries from Sam Underhill and Manu Tuilagi created enough space for the excellent George Ford to punch in from five metres out, securing the bonus point that would have been England\u2019s secondary objective for the evening.\n\nHaving turned down Ford\u2019s offer to sub in on kicking duties, Farrell split the posts for the first time and Argentina\u2019s efforts started to wane.\n\nEngland too seemed to change down a gear and look to conserve energy in the final 20 minutes, allowing Argentina a foot-hold in their half and allowing Moroni to break through the line from a lineout move and score only the second try under the English posts of the tournament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack Nowell and Mako Vunipola also made their first appearances of the Rugby World Cup having flown to Japan unfit to play initially and the former rewarded Jones\u2019 patience by beating one man, breaking out of a three-man tackle and then sneaking into the corner to remind England\u2019s dangerous back three that there is plenty of firepower on the bench.", "description": "England blunted a potentially
