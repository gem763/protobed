Jurgen Klopp has seen the effect that the young players have had on the Chelsea team and he credits Frank Lampard for that improvement. He said: \"Chelsea had some problems but they have sorted it well. I don't think they expected [to lose to Valencia]. It reminds me of my team in Dortmund a few years ago. Really young but they only played because they were that good. \"Frank Lampard did an outstanding job at Derby so I am not surprised by him at Chelsea. But it is a difficult league. I can see some people are not happy with some results but that is not because of him. He is a really good manager.\" A once fierce and fiery rivalry, one that pitted Frank Lampard against Steven Gerrard, has lost it's spark. How did that happen and can it be reignited?

The Blues pushed the Reds all the way to penalties in the Uefa Super Cup earlier in the season. And now, with their second chance at the Premier League leaders, they will aim for revenge to deny Jurgen Klopp's side a 100 per cent record after six games.\n\nPlease allow a moment for updates to load\n\nFrank Lampard admits he knew Mohamed Salah was destined for bigger things when the pair were together at Chelsea.\n\nSalah moved to Stamford Bridge in 2014 but struggled for game time under Jose Mourinho and made just 19 appearances for the club before joining Roma.\n\nLampard was a team-mate of the Egyptian for six months before his own Chelsea career came to an end that summer.\n\n\"Unfortunately for Mo, it didn't work out here but it is great credit to him. He went to Italy and then came back and now he's a superstar,\" said Lampard. \"As for his path, it's hard to compare what might have been. The talent was obviously there.\n\n\"At the time, I think we had a lot of options in attacking areas. Number 10s, wingers, and he didn't get as many opportunities for whatever reason, but yes, you could see the talent was there.\n\n\"But the player that he is now, or that came back to Liverpool, I think you have to say huge credit is due. You don't have to search for anything more than look at Mo himself.\n\n\"You have to say what professionalism and work ethic, to leave a club like Chelsea is not easy.\n\n\"People then cast you aside and say you won't make it there. He went on to be the superstar he is now. It is completely credit to Mo himself.\"", "description": "Chelsea\u00a0entertain Liverpool\u00a0at Stamford Bridge with the Premier League leaders looking to remain perfect after six games.\u00a0 The Blues pushed Jurgen Klopp's side all the way in Istanbul in the Uefa Super Cup, with the Champions League holders prevailing on penalties.\u00a0 With Manchester City destroying Watford yesterday, a victory, of any kind, will cement Liverpool's title", "authors": ["Michael Jones"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/22/16/Mohamed-Salah.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
