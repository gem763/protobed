This year, Acer says its successor, the Predator Thronos Air, is way more \u201caccessible\u201d thanks to a 25 per cent reduction in weight, smaller footprint, and added massage feature.\n\nI got to check out the Predator Thronos Air in person, and having done so, it\u2019s apparent Acer and I do not agree on the definition of accessible.\n\nThe original Thronos felt like your typical trade show stunt. A perfect example of something Acer built because they could and it would generate buzz that could trickle down to its other products. The existence of the Thronos Air makes me question whether Acer is aware that\u2019s what it was. It very earnestly feels like the company thinks this is something more than a handful of weird millionaires want to buy.\n\nOn the floor, I chatted with an Acer representative about why the company felt the need to even come out with a successor to an obvious niche product. That representative told me it really was about listening to user feedback and making a chair that wasn\u2019t just a concept. \u201cThe Thronos Air,\u201d the rep told me with a straight face, \u201cthis is the chair that people can actually buy and put in their homes.\u201d He went on to tell me that Acer had actually had several potential buyers willing to fork over the $US30,000 ($44,007), if not for the fact their homes couldn\u2019t physically support the chair.\n\nIf you scroll to the bottom of the original Thronos\u2019 product page, you\u2019ll find some fine print. The chair requires an area that measures 2.4m by 2.4m by 2.4m, a floor that can support at least 324kg, and it must be installed on the ground floor of a household or \u201csimilar environment.\u201d\n\nSo no apartment dwellers, no penthouse suites, and I guess your mansion needs its own RGB gaming cave on the ground or basement floor. Honestly, the mental image of the Thronos crashing through multiple floors of a house is equal parts funny and horrifying.\n\nThis chair will give you tender, loving ministrations for the low, low price of $US14,000 ($20,537) (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nThe Thronos Air was meant to alleviate some of that while keeping the decadent indulgence of the original. The Acer rep told me it\u2019s made of lighter materials, hence why it weighs 25-per cent less. (Though, if maths serves, that means you need a floor that can support 243kg. That\u2019s hardly Air-like.) And as an added bonus, they added a massage cushion, because if you\u2019re going to spend a year\u2019s worth of my rent on a chair, why the fuck not.\n\nAs you might imagine, as soon as the press conference ended, the new Thronos Air was swarmed by sweaty tech journalists elbowing each other for the novelty of gaming for a few minutes while having their backs massaged by this monstrous contraption. I, thinking myself clever, snapped some shots, asked my questions, and scheduled a private booth tour to check out the Thronos Air later. Better photos, no crowds, a chance to shoot video, and really formulate my thoughts and impressions.\n\nI thought I\u2019d have more time with the Predator Thronos Air. Alas, it was too thicc to move to the showroom floor. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing. When I showed up for the booth tour at Messe Berlin, I got some sad news. The Predator Thronos Air would not be available on the showroom floor. After the press conference, it was dismantled and shipped elsewhere. The process had apparently taken 3-4 hours, and given the weight, it just wasn\u2019t worth the effort to transport it from a few halls down and up some stairs. It\u2019s not that it couldn\u2019t be done. There\u2019s an original Thronos in the booth (though to be fair, Acer probably has more than one of those). Someone somewhere decided the more \u201caccessible\u201d version just wasn\u2019t worth it, and you know what, I don\u2019t really blame them.\n\nA few months ago, Gizmodo bought a DIY custom 8-monitor rig off Craigslist for $US640 ($939). It\u2019s admittedly lacking in RGB lighting and cupholders, and there\u2019s definitely no massage component. The original owner only spent $US2,300 ($3,374) and a couple hundred hours to build something that functionally, is similar to the Acer\u2019s Thronos chairs. Mayhaps the lesson here is if you can\u2019t resist the thrall of multiple monitors, at least check the internet before shelling out $20,000.\n\nEditor's Note: Unsurprisingly, there is no word on an Australian release or pricing for this chair.", "description": "After launching its ridiculous Predator Thronos \u201cgaming chair\u201d last year, a common refrain Acer heard from hopeful buyers was they regretted they couldn\u2019t plop down the $44,000 for the damn thing as it wouldn\u2019t fit in their homes.
