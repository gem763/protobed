He has abused his power. People can read that in that transcript.\u201d\n\nCastro then claimed Trump had used his position as president to \u201cboost himself\u201d and his own interests.\n\n\u201cIn unprecedented ways, he has used the office of the presidency to boost himself and put his own self-interest above the national interest,\u201d Castro asserted. \u201cHow much more evidence do people need that this man should not be anywhere near the Oval Office?\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, Castro was pressed on poor polling numbers for his campaign out of Nevada.\n\n\u201cThe most recent poll in Nevada showed not good news for you,\u201d Garcia-Navarro told Castro. \u201cYou did not have great numbers \u2013 in fact, close to 0%. It\u2019s a state with a lot of Latinos. That\u2019s got to have hurt to see that you didn\u2019t do as well as you may have hoped.\u201d\n\nCastro responded and claimed, \u201cNevada has gotten very little attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut is it sending a signal to you that perhaps it might be time to move on to something else?\u201d Garcia-Navarro asked Castro.\n\n\u201cNot at all. Not at all,\u201d Castro responded. \u201cWe have four months until Iowa votes and 4 1/2 months until Nevada caucuses. And so we\u2019re going to keep working hard in this campaign.\u201d", "description": "Democrat presidential hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro called for \"not only impeachment, but removal\" of President Donald Trump in a recent interview.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/julian-castro-squint-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
