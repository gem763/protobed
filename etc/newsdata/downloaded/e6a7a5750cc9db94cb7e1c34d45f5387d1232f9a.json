The first case was back in 2016, and involved a convicted felon named Alejandro Jimenez who bought a lower receiver in an ATF sting operation. After a judge ruled that the receiver wasn\u2019t an actual firearm under federal law, the case against Jimenez was dropped.\n\nEarlier this year, according to CNN, federal prosecutors also dropped similar charges against a California man named Joseph Roh, who was accused of running an illegal gun factory outside of Los Angeles. While the judge in the case ruled that Roh was guilty of selling finished firearms without a license, the judge also decided that the ATF had improperly ruled that 80% finished receivers as well as the finished receivers themselves were firearms.\n\nHe rejected the prosecution\u2019s argument that the ATF\u2019s interpretation of the regulation describing a receiver could reasonably be applied to the device at issue in Roh\u2019s case. \u201cThere is a disconnect,\u201d the judge wrote. Selna added that the combination of the federal law and regulation governing the manufacturing of receivers is \u201cunconstitutionally vague\u201d as applied in the case against Roh. \u201cNo reasonable person would understand that a part constitutes a receiver where it lacks the components specified in the regulation,\u201d Selna wrote. Therefore, the judge determined, \u201cRoh did not violate the law by manufacturing receivers.\u201d\n\nInstead of accepting the judge\u2019s ruling, the U.S. Attorney handling the case ended up offering Roh a plea bargain that would keep him out of prison, and keep the judge\u2019s ruling from being used as an argument in future cases.\n\nFollowing Selna\u2019s tentative order, the prosecution and defense agreed to a deal in which Roh would plead guilty to the charge against him, but would be allowed to withdraw that plea if he stayed out of trouble for a year. Prosecutors would then dismiss the case. If Roh abides by the deal, he will have no criminal conviction and serve no time behind bars.\n\nSources familiar with the agreement said prosecutors wanted to strike a deal in order to prevent Selna\u2019s order from becoming permanent, drawing publicity, and creating case law that could hamper ATF enforcement efforts. Roh accepted the deal to avoid a permanent conviction \u2014 and possible prison time \u2014 for dealing firearms without a license. This is not only going to be an issue for the ATF and U.S. Attorneys around the country going forward, but gun control groups could see some of their preferred policies stymied as well. If, in fact, lower receivers don\u2019t meet the federal definition of a firearm, what does that mean for New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 recent order to more than a dozen companies to stop selling unfinished receivers to New York residents. Under the existing definition of a \u201cfirearm\u201d in federal code, not only are the unfinished lower receivers not firearms, finished lower receivers aren\u2019t guns either. Can James really ban the sale of a block of metal to New York residents? I\u2019m not an attorney, but it seems beyond a 2nd Amendment challenge there\u2019s a Commerce Clause challenge waiting to be made.\n\nIn the meantime, it seems as if the DOJ is continuing to prosecute these types of cases, but will back off if a judge issues a ruling that puts their interpretation of the ATF regulations in jeopardy. Rather than change their regulations to comply with the federal definition of a firearm, it seems like they\u2019re taking this on a case-by-case basis and hoping to avoid any \u201cproblematic\u201d rulings in the future.", "description": "According to CNN, federal prosecutors have dropped at least two cases after judges ruled ATF regs don't comply with the federal definition of a firearm", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/80/2272f605-608b-4f82-be15-e6937bdf7548.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
