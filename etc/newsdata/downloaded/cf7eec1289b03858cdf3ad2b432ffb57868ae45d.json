But 2019 is not a normal year.\n\nIn May 2019, Huawei was placed on a US trade blacklist, preventing US companies from doing business with Huawei without permission from the US government. As a result, Huawei cannot use Google\u2019s Android operating system on its upcoming phone, the Mate 30 Pro, a Google spokesperson confirmed to Reuters.\n\nDespite this, Huawei is still planning to launch its Mate 30 Pro smartphone in September. But the anticipation and excitement of a new Huawei phone launch within the company is likely now tainted by apprehension.\n\nWithout the the Android operating system, Huawei\u2019s Mate 30 phones can\u2019t run Google\u2019s suite of apps, nor can they run Android apps from the Google Play Store. That puts Huawei\u2019s upcoming Mate 30 smartphone at a dizzying disadvantage. Faced with the choice of phones with all the apps they want versus a Huawei phone with a limited offering, it\u2019s pretty clear which phone consumers will go for.\n\nTo be sure, Huawei has a backup operating system called Harmony OS, which has the potential to make upcoming Huawei smartphones at least usable. But Huawei faces the gargantuan task of getting app developers to make apps that run on Huawei\u2019s Harmony OS.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s ill-fated Windows Phone has shown that it\u2019s not so easy to get app developers to make apps for an outlying operating system. Windows Phone arguably spiraled out of existence because of a vicious paradox: Windows Phone didn\u2019t have the apps people wanted, so few people bought Windows phones. And since few people were buying Windows phones, app developers didn\u2019t deem it worthwhile to develop apps to run on Windows Phone.\n\nIf Harmony OS lacks just one popular app, Huawei\u2019s competition is already more enticing, no matter how good Huawei\u2019s phone looks, how many features it has, or how good its camera might be.\n\nIf Huawei doesn\u2019t get off the US blacklist, the company\u2019s smartphone business eventually risks suffering the same fate as Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone.\n\nHuawei always has the chance to surprise us and prove history wrong with Harmony OS. After all, as the second largest phone maker in the world, Huawei\u2019s smartphone business already has a large following. App developers are surely aware of that, and they, too, would feel the impact of Huawei\u2019s ban from using Google\u2019s Android. Millions of users suddenly won\u2019t be using their apps. If that impact is big enough, they might just make their apps available on the Harmony OS app store.\n\nHuawei\u2019s blacklisted status in the US isn\u2019t necessarily permanent. Trump has indicated that the US government could lift the ban should a trade deal be reached between the US and China. But the trade \u201cwar\u201d between the US and China still appears far from resolved, and in the meantime, the fate of Huawei\u2019s smartphone business is uncertain.", "description": "Business Insider - Google confirmed that Huawei's upcoming Mate 30 Pro won't run Android, meaning the smartphone won't come with the apps people want..
