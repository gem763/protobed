USA TODAY\n\nDoes it seem like this is a terribly light week on the fantasy football waiver wire? Or are there just not enough startable players to go around? Fantasy teams' depth will be tested in Week 6 with the Bills, Bears, Colts and Raiders getting the week off.\n\nSomeone has to fill those open roster spots. Let's see who might be available.\n\nRecommended bids based on a free agent acquisition budget (FAAB) of $100 for the season.\n\nBEST BETS\n\nTE Gerald Everett, Los Angeles Rams ($10). There weren\u2019t many breakout performances in Week 5, but fantasy owners looking for a tight end may have found one in Everett. He had a season-high 136 receiving yards on Thursday night and has a total of 19 targets the past two weeks.\n\nRams tight end Gerald Everett had a career-high 136 receiving yards in Week 5 at Seattle.

Edmonds had a surprising share of the backfield work on Sunday with eight carries for 68 yards and a TD, plus three catches for 14 more yards. If Johnson's back injury turns out to be something that has him at less than 100% this week, it may take twice as much to land Edmonds.\n\nWR Zay Jones, Oakland Raiders ($6). There are still three weeks remaining until the NFL's trade deadline, but the Raiders and Buffalo Bills got an early start. Jones had only seven receptions in five weeks with the Bills, but a rash of injuries to Raiders receivers could open up some playing time in a better pass offense. No. 1 wideout Tyrell Williams was inactive last week with a foot injury, so opportunity could be knocking.\n\nWR Darius Slayton, New York Giants ($6). The first-year wideout gave Daniel Jones another option in the passing game on Sunday by catching four of his five targets against the Vikings for 62 yards and a touchdown. If Sterling Shepard has to miss time with a concussion, Slayton's value takes a considerable jump.\n\nLikely already on rosters (but check to be sure): WR Auden Tate, Cincinnati Bengals; TE Chris Herndon, New York Jets.\n\nREPLACEMENTS\n\nRB Jon Hilliman, New York Giants ($4). Likely a one-week play due to Wayne Gallman's concussion and Saquon Barkley's impending return, Hilliman could be a fantasy contributor based on volume alone. Just don't expect much production with the top-ranked New England Patriots defense up next on Thursday night.\n\nQB Devlin Hodges, Pittsburgh Steelers ($3). With Mason Rudolph sustaining a concussion, Hodges was pressed into emergency duty on Sunday. Hodges played it safe, completing seven of his nine attempts for 68 yards. Expect the Steelers to give him a little more rope against the L.A. Chargers with a full week of practice under his belt. He'll only have value while Rudolph is out, but could be a starter in 2-QB or QB-flex leagues.\n\nRB Benny Snell, Pittsburgh Steelers ($2). The Steelers have a similar situation at running back with Jaylen Samuels injuring his knee on Sunday. Although James Connor will likely get an even larger share of the workload, Snell will take over the change-of-pace role.\n\nWR Byron Pringle, Kansas City Chiefs ($2). Don\u2019t read too much into the stats Pringle put up on Sunday. Playing in place of an injured Sammy Watkins, he caught six passes for 103 yards and a touchdown. The Chiefs offense can turn just about anyone on the roster into a star, but Watkins \u2013 and possibly Tyreek Hill \u2013 could be back this week.\n\nPotential QB streamers: Jimmy Garoppolo, San Francisco 49ers (at L.A. Rams); Gardner Minshew, Jacksonville Jaguars (vs. N.O.); Kyle Allen, Carolina Panthers (at T.B.); Andy Dalton, Cincinnati Bengals (at Bal.).\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
