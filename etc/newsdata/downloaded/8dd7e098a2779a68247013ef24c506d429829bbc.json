This motivates me more to contribute to the fight against hatred.\n\nMany may feel that they will never be a victim of a hate crime, terror or any form of racist abuse. That\u2019s what I used to think, but Martyn\u2019s death certainly changed my life and how I view the world.\n\nRising hate crime targeting people from different cultures, backgrounds and ethnicities can divide communities in this country, creating an illusion of a clash of cultures which only further emboldens extremists. Hatred in all its forms must be tackled to reduce the terror threat.\n\nBy delivering workshops in schools, universities and other institutions, I not only talk about how my son Martyn\u2019s story has motivated me, but also about the importance of respect to others that may be different to you, with the hope to foster the kind of tolerance and resilience in young people that I saw in my son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHate Crime Awareness Week shouldn\u2019t be seen as a stand-alone opportunity to speak against hatred.\n\nThe week is part of the greater cause to educate ourselves and others on the power of our words and actions. They can destroy if motivated by hate, but words and actions can also be used to uplift and inspire.\n\nEducation is the key to making real change, and it\u2019s important to encourage people from a young age to make a difference.\n\nIn the last year I\u2019ve managed to reach nearly 5,000 children around the country and what I\u2019ve seen gives me real hope.\n\nYoung people are interested, curious about the world and about people who have different opinions to their own.\n\nAnd this tolerance and appreciation for our society starts at home, not through grand gestures. It\u2019s through making a cup of tea, giving a compliment and spending less time on your phones.\n\nI believe critical thinking should be encouraged from an early age and this message shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted.\n\nMany may feel that they will never be a victim of a hate crime, terror or any form of racist abuse.\n\nThat\u2019s what I used to think, but Martyn\u2019s death certainly changed my life and how I view the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t take something so tragic for people to make an effort to stop and think about what they say and how the act. We all have a part to play in making our society better.\n\nMORE: Hate crimes against disabled people are growing and abusers are getting away with it\n\nMORE: Homophobic hate crime prosecutions drop despite reports more than doubling\n\nMORE: In rejecting the definition of Islamophobia government is dismissing the abuse we receive", "description": "When you hear such horrific news about your own family, I think many turn to anger to try and cope with the pain.", "authors": ["Figen Murray"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pri_67340466_1571396230.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
