Donn C. Young, who died on Jan. 18, 1943, will be laid to rest with full military honors Tuesday in front of about 20 of his family members in a ceremony that will include an Air Force flyover, according to Stars and Stripes.\n\nYoung\u2019s remains were discovered in 1998 by Alfred Hagen, a Philadelphia business owner whose great-uncle, Maj. Bill Benn, was flying with him in the cockpit on that fateful day. After advances in DNA technology, they were positively identified as his last year.\n\nThe exact circumstances surrounding Young\u2019s death are unclear.\n\nD-DAY DISCOVERY: REPORTER'S FAMOUS WARTIME RECORDING FOUND IN NEW YORK BASEMENT\n\nHagen told Stars and Stripes that Young and his great-uncle were flying around the Owen Stanley Mountain Range \u2013 which has peaks as high as 13,000 feet \u2013 the day their B-25, dubbed Algernon IV, went down.\n\n\u201cMaybe they got battle damage,\u201d Hagen said. \u201cThey lost their left engine. There were violent thunderstorms that afternoon. The mountains were uncharted at that time, and they were trying to find a pass where they could sneak through.\u201d\n\nHagen says the plane and its seven-man crew crashed while on a mission to search for locations in the jungle that Allied aircraft could land if their planes ever took on damage from Japanese forces.\n\nA local resident discovered the B-25\u2019s crash site in 1956 and remains taken from it the following year were buried in a mass grave in Kentucky, Stars and Stripes reports.\n\nMONTANA HIGHWAY NAMED AFTER MARINE WHO HELPED PROVIDE PATH FOR ICONIC IWO JIMA FLAG RAISING\n\nHagen then visited Papua New Guinea numerous times in the 1990s to search for the crash site himself. He finally discovered it in 1998 and brought newly uncovered remains \u2013 along with Young\u2019s dog tags that he found there \u2013 to the U.S. Embassy in Port Moresby, the website says.\n\nYoung\u2019s grandson, Donn Alexander, told Stars and Stripes that he submitted a DNA sample to the Defense Department in 2005 after being told they were trying to identify the remains, but \u201cdidn\u2019t hear anything for years.\u201d\n\nThen last year, he says he was informed that one set of remains Hagen found were confirmed to be Young\u2019s \u2014 a piece of news that would leave him \u201cvery happy,\u201d as \u201cthere would be some closure on that.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHagen is expected to be alongside Alexander at the funeral Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere is a special pain when you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t understand the fate of a loved one,\u201d he told Stars and Stripes. \u201cIt was a pain that my own family knew all too well.\u201d", "description": "An American pilot whose remains were lost for decades after his B-25 bomber crashed into a mountain in Papua New Guinea during World War II is set to be buried this week at Arlington National Cemetery.", "authors": ["Greg Norman"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/iStock-arlington.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
