(PM) and Altria Group Inc. (MO) on Wednesday said they have called off merger talks and said they will focus on launching the IQOS heated-tobacco product in the U.S.\n\n\"While we believed the creation of a new merged company had the potential to create incremental revenue and cost synergies, we could not reach agreement,\" said Howard Willard, Altria's chairman and chief executive. \"We look forward to continuing our commercialization of IQOS in the U.S. under our existing arrangement.\"\n\nPhilip Morris and Altria last month said they were in advanced talks to reunite the tobacco giants in a blockbuster all-stock deal that would have created a company with a market value of roughly $200 billion.\n\nAltria in early 2008 completed the spinoff of Philip Morris, allowing its giant overseas tobacco division to concentrate on international markets while Altria remained focused on the U.S.\n\nThe companies share many of the same brands, including the top-selling Marlboro.\n\nWrite to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 25, 2019 07:55 ET (11:55 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
