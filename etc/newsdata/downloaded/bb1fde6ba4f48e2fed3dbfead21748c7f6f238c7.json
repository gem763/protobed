REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir/File Photo\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri, leading a delegation to Abu Dhabi seeking support, had told Reuters he was hoping the UAE would inject cash into its central bank.\n\nBefore the lifting of the travel ban was announced, Hariri said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d after visiting the UAE and meeting with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. He said the UAE would announce any support initiative that may come. \u201cThe atmosphere is good,\u201d Hariri said on Twitter.\n\nThe UAE barred its citizens from travelling to Lebanon in 2016. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have both voiced frequent concern over the political situation in Lebanon, which is located next to war-torn Syria and is home to the heavily armed Hezbollah group backed by the two Gulf states\u2019 main adversary, Iran.\n\nLebanon is now seeking a cash injection for its central bank and investments in food, infrastructure, oil and gas, and renewable energy.\n\nFaced with one of the world\u2019s highest debt burdens, low growth and crumbling infrastructure, Beirut has vowed to implement long-delayed reforms. It is also seeking to reverse a sharp loss of confidence among foreign investors and depositors who are turning away from the Lebanese pound.\n\nWhile no deal was formally announced, Lebanese officials portrayed Monday\u2019s high-stakes talks as positive while Abu Dhabi stressed its support for Lebanon. In response, dollar bonds issued by heavily-indebted Lebanon rose.\n\nA Lebanese government source said Hariri would remain in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday for follow-up meetings.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed \u201cstressed during the meeting that the UAE...is keen on supporting its relationships with Lebanon on different levels, and stands by it in all that preserves its security and stability,\u201d the state news agency WAM reported.\n\nWhen asked earlier on Monday whether Lebanon would receive an injection of cash into its central bank from the UAE, Hariri said: \u201cWe are working on everything ... Yes we are hoping, we will work on it.\u201d\n\nThe bank has been drawing down its foreign exchange reserves to repay the state\u2019s maturing dollar-denominated debt, and said last week it was prepared to do more.\n\nCentral bank Governor Riad Salameh, also attending the conference, said it was continuing to provide dollars to local financial markets. He added that Lebanon has \u201cnumerous possibilities\u201d as it looks for assistance, but it anticipates support from the UAE.\n\nSEEKING PUBLIC PLEDGES\n\nLebanon\u2019s traditionally high reserves of foreign currency have been in decline because capital inflows into its banking system from Lebanese abroad have been slowing.\n\nBeirut, which has a debt-to-GDP ratio tmsnrt.rs/2Oj0wKg of around 150%, hopes its Gulf allies or regional sovereign wealth funds will offer support but no public pledges have so far been made.\n\nAt Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sea Palace, the leaders \u201cdiscussed the latest developments in Lebanon and the region and the bilateral relations between the two countries\u201d, Hariri\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nFinancial markets have tightened significantly this year, raising the costs for Lebanon of borrowing and insuring against default. Dollar-denominated bonds, which rose on Monday, remain down some 15% this year.
