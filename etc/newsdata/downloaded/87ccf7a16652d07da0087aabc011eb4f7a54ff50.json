BILLY GRAHAM: 'HAVE FUN IN HELL'\n\nThe official complaint reportedly cited a \"consistent lack of professionalism\" and expressed disappointment with NYU for hiring someone like Duca.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed at the department and NYU as an institution for hiring a professor without a syllabus and classroom management skills. We are disappointed at the department and NYU for hiring a professor without a clear course objective,\" the complaint reportedly read.\n\nMore detailed complaints were shared with BuzzFeed, which published a lengthy profile on the feminist writer on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere was no syllabus or clear expectations of what she would be teaching us. The class kind of banded together to teach each other things so that we weren\u2019t the subject of Lauren\u2019s wrath,\" one student reportedly said.\n\nStudents described her course as a \"waste of six weeks,\" \"a master class in Lauren Duca's personal life,\" while also saying she would disappear for 30 to 45 minutes to meditate. One student said that Duca \"is that 'worst idea' that conservatives think liberals are.\"\n\nFormer students also accused Duca of treating a foreign student disrespectfully.\n\nWhile Duca admitted she took 15 minutes for meditation and claimed she read all the assignments, she explained her course in radically different terms.\n\n\u201cI created a dynamic, experimental, ever-evolving course structure that pulled from my syllabus, added things in based on our conversation and allowed each of them to individually craft their pieces, and I watched the pieces evolve over the course of the semester,\u201d she told BuzzFeed.\n\n'CREEPY' PHOTO COLLAGE GETS MARTIN SHKRELI SUSPENDED FROM TWITTER\n\nAs for whether the class achieved its \"objective,\" Duca indicated students may have just not realized they were internalizing them. \u201cI think that they, on some level, internalized some of the objectives, whether they know that explicitly or not,\" Duca reportedly said.\n\nNYU acknowledged the official complaint, according to BuzzFeed, and has reached out to speak to one of the students in person. On Twitter, Duca didn't respond to BuzzFeed's profile after it was published.\n\nProfessor Ted Conover, Director of NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, indicated that the school was still reviewing the complaints and hadn't determined the appropriate course of action.\n\nDAN GAINOR: SOME 'JOURNALISTS' HAPPY TO PITCH IN ON LAST-DITCH HIT JOB ON KAVANAUGH\n\n\"The quality of the classroom experience is something we take very seriously, and we place a high priority on ensuring that instruction given in our classes helps prepare students for their careers,\" Conover said in a statement provided to Fox News.\n\n\"We received a complaint pertaining to Ms. Duca's course late last week; I have reached out to the student who sent it to me - the only one I have heard from directly regarding this course - and am eager to understand more about the problems she has cited.\n\n\"After the review of this matter is complete, we will determine the course of action that is in the best interests of our students and their education; if there were problems, we don't want our students experiencing them again.\"\n\nAccording to NYU's website, Duca's syllabus planned for students to review a variety of materials, including her own op-eds.\n\nJEFF ZUCKER'S CNN ACCUSED OF 'WORST FEMALE REPRESENTATION' WHEN IT COMES TO ON-AIR HOSTS\n\n\"Through two writing assignments and a fully-conceptualized social media presence, the Feminist Journalist will establish the imperative of interconnected motivations in the ideology of feminism and practice of journalism in the totality of the writer\u2019s communication with the world,\" Duca's syllabus read.\n\nDuca also unloaded on BuzzFeed reporter Scaachi Koul after she pressed her on details surrounding the official complaint. \u201cYou should put in there that my tone was expressly p---ed off and frustrated,\u201d Duca reportedly said during a phone conversation with Koul.\n\n\u201cYou're being so f-----g hard on me, Scaachi, and I really, really, really, really would ask you if you would be grilling a man in this same way. It's amazing. The s--- that I have endured to continue to sustain a voice where I'm just fighting every inch for the same thing that I think that you want, which is public power and equality, and I'm trying my g-----n best, okay?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter the line went silent and Koul asked Duca if she was still there, Duca mockingly congratulated her. \u201cCongratulations, you thrillingly, thrillingly adept journalist, you have discovered that Lauren Duca is not perfect. Put it in the headline, baby,\" she said.\n\nDuca has had a wild few years since entering the spotlight. In addition to receiving journalism awards, she's also faced harassment from Twitter trolls like former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli.\n\nDuca has also called the Republican Party a \"terrorist organization\" and blasted renowned pastor Billy Graham, telling him to \"have fun in Hell\" after his death.", "description": "Writer Lauren Duca taught a class called \"The Feminist Journalist\" at New York University during the summer and it reportedly didn't go well -- according to some of her\u00a0former\u00a0students.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
