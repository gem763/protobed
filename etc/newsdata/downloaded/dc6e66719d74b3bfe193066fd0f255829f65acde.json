The fact that we\u2019ve met our 2020 target ahead of time means the narrative is working.\u201d\n\nMs Trenowden, who was awarded a CBE in 2018, said research has shown that more diverse boards contribute to better overall business performance.\n\nIn relation to gender diversity, research by Rebecca Moss at the University of Nottingham published last year found that female board directors significantly improve banks\u2019 performance during a financial crisis.\n\nHer findings provide support for the business case for more female directors, \u201cespecially within high-risk environments\u201d, she argued.\n\nDespite the progress on gender diversity, equal representation is still a way off. According to the 30% Club, only 13 FTSE350 companies have female chief executives \u2013 a share of less than 4 per cent.
