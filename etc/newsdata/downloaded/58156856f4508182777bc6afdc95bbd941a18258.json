REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nBroadcom Inc (AVGO.O), among the world\u2019s biggest chipmakers, weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq with a 2.6% fall, after it said in results late on Thursday that demand for microchips had bottomed out and that a recovery was not yet on the cards.\n\nThat pointed to more headwinds for tech companies buffeted this year by the trade conflict. Technology stocks .SPLRCT fell 0.6% and were the biggest drag among the 11 major S&P sectors.\n\nApple (AAPL.O) fell 2.3% after Goldman Sachs cut its price target for the stock, citing concerns over its new Apple TV+ service.\n\nAdding to the high-growth tech sector\u2019s losses, a U.S. House of Representatives panel demanded internal emails and other records from Apple and other technology giants - Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).\n\nAll of the FAANG stocks, apart from Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) came under pressure.\n\nStill, the S&P 500\u2019s marginal gains brought it to within 0.6% of its record high, with financial stocks .SPSY providing the biggest boost.\n\nBanks .SPXBK followed U.S. Treasury yields higher after data showed U.S. retail sales rose 0.4% in August, lifted by spending on cars, building materials, healthcare and hobbies. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 0.2%.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Industrial Average .DJI was also within 0.6% of its all-time high and was set for its eighth straight session of gains to match a winning streak from May 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural for the market to take a pause here given the recent trading in the last few days,\u201d said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GlobAlt in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cTo break through from this point, there probably needs to be some incremental news from a global growth perspective or more meaningful developments on trade.\u201d\n\nTrade worries were soothed this week after tariff concessions from both the United States and China, and President Donald Trump\u2019s latest comments that he was potentially open to an interim trade deal with China.\n\nHowever, doubts about U.S. growth remain, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting that the tit-for-tat tariffs could reduce global GDP in 2020 by 0.8%.\n\nAt 1:09 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 47.02 points, or 0.17%, at 27,229.47, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 0.80 points, or 0.03%, at 3,010.37 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 11.42 points, or 0.14%, at 8,183.05.\n\nTyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), the United States\u2019 largest meat processor, rose 2.5% after China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency said the country would exempt some U.S. pork and soybeans from additional tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nThe defensive healthcare .SPXHC, real estate .SPLRCR and consumer staples sectors .SPLRCS were among the laggards on the S&P 500.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.04-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.44-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 19 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 74 new highs and 16 new lows.", "description": "Losses in shares of U.S. technology majors Apple and Broadcom held the S&P 500 just under record levels on Friday, as traders balanced the latest indicators of an uncertain global growth outlook with perceived progress in Sino-U.S. trade relations.", "authors": ["Uday Sampath Kumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429453101&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C10Z", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
