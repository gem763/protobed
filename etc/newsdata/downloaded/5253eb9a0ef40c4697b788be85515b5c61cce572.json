Photo: NBC\n\nIn November 1891, a mere four months after the publication of Sir Conan Doyle\u2019s first Sherlock Holmes story, Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie published \u201cMy Evening With Sherlock Holmes,\u201d the first in a long line of pastiches of the character that continue to be written to this day. From the earliest introductions of detective fiction, comedy has been right there behind them.\n\nThat\u2019s not especially surprising, of course; often comedy is about trying to gain power over that which frightens us. It\u2019s the reason there are so many jokes about death and dying: If we can laugh at it, it\u2019s a little less scary. Things such as crime, being investigated, murder, and stalkers are terrifying, so it\u2019s no wonder that the world of mystery has long been the target of comedy. Sketch comics have found inspiration in the genre dating back at least 50 years, when Monty Python spoofed one of the masters. We\u2019ve rounded up some of the most memorable detectives in sketch comedy, arranged in order of incident (a.k.a. airdate), to examine their caseloads and determine just how effectively they blended mystery with their humor.\n\nAgatha Christie Sketch\n\nShow: Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus\n\n\ufeffFirst Aired: 1969\n\nThe Detectives: Inspector Tiger, Chief Superintendent Lookout of the Yard, Assistant Chief Constable Theresamanbehindyer\n\nThe Case: The body in the room\n\nHow Central Is the Mystery?: Very.\n\nThe classic locked-room mystery. The lights go down, a shot rings out, a murderer is somewhere in the room. Only in this case, we never really get to know the suspects in the room, played by Graham Chapman and Carol Cleveland, because our various inspectors, constables, and superintendents, played by the rest of the Pythons, keep reenacting the murder, only to find themselves as the next murder victim. The bodies (literally) pile up, and the officials with increasingly stupid names continue to arrive with no sign of resolution in sight.\n\nScams and Flams\n\nShow: Mr. Show\n\n\ufeffFirst Aired: 1998\n\nThe Detective: Investigative Reporter Yale Hadarity\n\nThe Case: Wishing Well \u2018N Such: scam or legitimate business?\n\nHow Central Is the Mystery?: It drives Yale, but it also leads him much deeper than anticipated.\n\nSometimes a case goes deeper than you ever could have expected. This is where investigative reporter Yale Hadarity (David Cross) finds himself as he digs into a new local business that seems to be taking money from the naive in exchange for wishes. Yale walks through the business model with the shop\u2019s proprietor, Barn (Bob Odenkirk), and determines that everything is on the up and up, but it turns out he was only scratching the surface of the true nature of Wishing Well \u2018N Such. Or did he actually have the full story the whole time?\n\nFetal Scooby-Doo\n\nShow: TV Funhouse\n\n\ufeffFirst Aired: 2000\n\nThe Detectives: Fetal Scooby-Doo and the Fetal Scooby Gang\n\nThe Case: Mystery at the old amusement park\n\nHow Central Is the Mystery?: Very. Those meddling kids are tenacious!\n\nIn a world where the cartoons age Scooby down from adult to pup, there\u2019s only one stage in the life-cycle left to exploit. Leave it to TV Funhouse to heighten to the extreme with Fetal Scooby-Doo. Fetal Scoob and the gang explore the amusement park to discover the ghost that\u2019s haunting the place, because no umbilical cords are going to stop them from uncovering the truth! In the end, Shaggy and the rest rip the mask off the ghost (through the amniotic sac) and find it was Fetal Old Man Jenkins trying to obtain the uranium field the park was built over. Fetal Scooby Snacks for all!\n\nThe Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar\n\nShow: That Mitchell and Webb Look\n\n\ufeffFirst Aired: 2006\n\nThe Detective: Sir Digby Chicken Caesar\n\nThe Case: \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d (and saving humanity from his nemesis, \u201csome bastard who\u2019s presumably responsible\u201d)\n\nHow Central Is the Mystery?: Depending on your perspective, it is either the only thing that matters or it is completely non-existent.\n\nSir Digby Chicken Caesar (Robert Webb) and his assistant Ginger (David Mitchell) are somewhat-modern Holmes and Watson figures who are attempting to rid the streets of London of crime, from their perspective. Over the course of Mitchell and Webb\u2019s show, Sir Digby and Ginger had several adventures together, and though they usually prevail (or at least Digby does), their fight against \u201cevil\u201d seems to stir up more harm than good, unless Digby is telling the truth and that old woman really did steal that VCR from the government.\n\nPoirot and Miss Marple\n\nShow: The Peter Serafinowicz Show\n\n\ufeffFirst Aired: 2007\n\nThe Detectives: Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple\n\nThe Case: The mistaken heart attack and the case of the fleeing father\n\nHow Central Is the Mystery?: Very quickly ignored by the detectives.\n\nIn a meeting that was destined to happen, both of Agatha Christie\u2019s classic detectives are brought together for a truly memorable team-up. The instant they meet, Poirot (Peter Serafinowicz) and Marple (Bronagh Gallagher) immediately recognize the intellectual prowess of one another and get down to the business of investigating the bedroom for clues, alone. But when the two detectives\u2019 moans and cries sound throughout the estate, Hastings and the inspector barge in and discover that the murderer had attacked the two \u2026 and stolen Poirot\u2019s trousers! Together, these two legendary detectives don\u2019t get any closer to the murderer, but they do get much, much closer.\n\nDateline: Keith Morrison\n\nShow: Saturday Night Live\n\n\ufeffFirst Aired: 2011\n\nThe Detective: Keith Morrison\n\nThe Case: The mystery of the chopped up guy\n\nHow Central Is the Mystery?: Very. Keith Morrison is very focused on every detail.\n\nBill Hader\u2019s version of Dateline\u2019s Keith Morrison hasn\u2019t met a murder he didn\u2019t like. Hang on \u2014 \u201clike\u201d isn\u2019t strong enough. He hasn\u2019t met a murder he wasn\u2019t super stoked about. Keith tells us the sad tale of Elroy Valentine (Bobby Moynihan), who was bludgeoned and hacked to pieces, by talking to the man who discovered his body (Taran Killam), Elroy\u2019s wife (Kristen Wiig), the coroner (Jason Sudekis), and the murderer himself (Steve Buscemi), all while having a hard time containing his excitement for each new, grisly detail he manages to collect.\n\nPrivate Detective\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nShow: Saturday Night Live\n\n\ufeffFirst Aired: 2012\n\nThe Detective: Sam Flint\n\nThe Case: The unfaithful wife\n\nHow Central Is the Mystery?: The solution to the mystery is thrust; it\u2019s the delivery that is unusual.\n\nMr. Morelli (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) suspects his wife of cheating on him, so he turns to Sam Flint (Bill Hader), the best private detective/amateur cartoonist he could get. Flint breaks the news to him with a series of increasingly incriminating caricatures depicting Morelli\u2019s wife, her tennis-playing lover, and eventually Flint himself. Flint gets results at any cost \u2014 just don\u2019t call \u2019em \u201ccartoons.\u201d (Watch it here.)\n\nHonorable mention: Unfortunately, video of it doesn\u2019t exist online, but another wonderfully inept private-detective sketch from Saturday Night Live involves a dame, a man, and a whole lot of burritos. Check out the transcript here.\n\nCat Poster\n\nShow: Key and Peele\n\n\ufeffFirst Aired: 2013\n\nThe Detective: Unnamed\n\nThe Case: Who runs Carter Finley\u2019s crew?\n\nHow Central Is the Mystery?: Our detective is very focused, but has a long way to go.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar story: An angry detective (Keegan-Michael Key) is looking for answers and brings in the one guy they\u2019ve managed to nab: Carter Finley (Jordan Peele). Carter weaves a tale of the big man in charge, Cat Branchman, who hangs out at the Clutching Kitten on the corner of Hang and Fur Street. Before long the twist reveals itself to the detective: Carter is just looking at his \u201cHang in There\u201d poster and making all of this up. Our detective tries his best to get answers out of his perp, but as even more twists are introduced, he ends up raising more questions than he answers \u2026", "description": "A roundup of some of the best mystery-themed sketches from \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d \u201cKey and Peele,\u201d \u201cMr. Show,\u201d \u201cMonty Python,\u201d \u201cThat Mitchell and Webb Look,\u201d and more.", "authors": ["Ramsey Ess"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-bill-hader-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
