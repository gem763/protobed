If you tell the police I will murder you and your children.\u2019\n\nShakur remained at large for a decade before being brought back to Britain to face trial for the three murders.\n\nPolice discovered the bodies on January 10 following calls from Ms Begum\u2019s concerned relatives.\n\nThey found the body of 4ft 8in Ms Begum under a bed cover with Anika lying across her and Thanha beside the bed.\n\nAnika had been strangled with a white sock bound tightly around her neck, the court heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJurors were told that bruising on each side of her face indicated she had been \u2018stunned\u2019 by a blow before she was killed.\n\nThanha died from a severe head injury, having suffered blows to her face and head causing skull fractures, the court heard.\n\nShe could have survived for up to 30 minutes as she bled out on the carpet, it was claimed.\n\nNo fatal injuries were found on Ms Begum\u2019s body, leading to the conclusion she may have been smothered with a soft pillow or cushion, the court heard.\n\nThe absence of any fatal wounds to Ms Begum indicates she was likely smothered, jurors heard (Picture: Central News)\n\nPolice found no sign of Ms Begum\u2019s 22-carat gold necklaces, earrings and bangles worth \u00a315,000 or her gold wedding set, the court heard.\n\nMr Spens took jurors through a catalogue of alleged domestic violence incidents Ms Begum had suffered at Shakur\u2019s hands in the past.\n\nIn June 2001, Shakur lost his temper, grabbed her neck and scratched Thanha, who was then aged just 10 months, it was claimed.\n\nShe said the violence was sparked when Shakur lost his passport ahead of the imminent expiry of his leave to remain in the country.\n\nWithin days, police were called back to her home, the court heard.\n\nShakur was said to have grabbed seven months pregnant Ms Begum and pushed her against the wall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was forced out of the house having threatened to kill everyone in there and smash the windows, jurors were told.\n\nMr Spens said: \u2018These were not isolated incidents but showed a pattern of aggressive behaviour in June 2001 towards his wife and on one occasion with complete disregard for the presence of Thanha, who ended up being scratched, whilst using violence against Juli.\u2019\n\nShakur denies three counts of murder and the trial continues.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
