To put the scale of the wealth of this current crop of people aged 40 and under into context, the richest person on the inaugural list in 2003 was the late John Ilhan, with an estimated wealth of $200 million, which is roughly $282 million in today's money. That would only be enough to put Ilhan, the man who started Crazy John's mobile phone chain, in 16th place this year, sitting behind fintech whiz kid Nicholas Molnar, whose wealth has rocketed from $95 million last year to $341 million as investors flock to his business Afterpay Touch Group.\n\nMolnar is part of this year's big trend \u2013 more than a third of the 21 new entrants are playing in the finance and fintech space. They include co-founders of Prospa, Greg Moshal ($101 million) and Beau Bertoli ($45 million), who built their fortunes out of small business' frustration with accessing finance. In 2012 they launched Prospa, which offers same-day approval of loans with funds delivered within 24 hours. There are also more traditional money mangers joining the list, including Paradice Investment Management's small-cap fund managers Adam Harvey and Rishi Khilnani, Caledonia's New York-based chief investment officer Mike Messara and VGI Partners' Doug Tynan.\n\nMeanwhile there's money to be made from offering the Instagram generation feel-good fixes, from fitness to face fillers. Kayla Itsines and Tobi Pearce are big movers this year as their fitness app, Sweat, booms worldwide. More than 30 million people have signed up to the $20-per-month subscription app since its inception in 2015.\n\nMike Cannon-Brookes (left) and Scott Farquhar, in a rare moment seen dressed in something other than jeans and T-shirts, their preferred office attire.

The business offers anti-wrinkle injections, dermal fillers, teeth whitening and acne treatments. Kate Morris and husband James Height debut with an estimated wealth of $30 million due to the success of their online cosmetics business Adore Beauty. Others benefiting from making people look good are model turned businesswoman Miranda Kerr, who continues to grow Kora Organics skincare, while Alex Tomic and Nik Mirkovic, the Gold Coast entrepreneurs behind LED teeth-whitening kit business HiSmile, are now turning over $50 million.\n\nThere are also debuts from well-known individuals, the most high profile being former captain of the Australian cricket team Steve Smith with an estimated wealth of $27 million. It flows mostly from his investment in mattress maker Koala and his investment property portfolio. His wealth would have been significantly higher had it not been for a ball-tampering scandal in March, which cost him sponsors and cricket income.", "description": "Feel-good fitness and skincare businesses join finance and fintech in generating a record Financial Review Young Rich year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.4034%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1983%2C$x_12%2C$y_348/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e0bac049b5550dfdb6c3b03ce7c4d644cf70193f", "published_at": "2018-09-18"}
