They said McGlockton was in the store, and when he returned with the couple's 5-year-old son, the dispute escalated and McGlockton shoved Drejka to the ground.\n\ntoggle caption Pinellas County, Fla., Sheriff's Office via AP\n\nSurveillance video of the scene shows Drejka, who has a conceal-carry permit, drawing his weapon and firing one fatal shot at McGlockton.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri didn't initially arrest Drejka because he thought the \"stand your ground\" law could apply.\n\nThe law, as described by The Associated Press, is a lengthy one that \"generally says a shooting is justified if a reasonable person under those circumstances would believe they are in danger of death or great bodily harm. But it also says the shooter could not have instigated the altercation.\"\n\nGualtieri said Drejka told deputies, \"When he was on the ground ... he was in fear ... that the next thing that's going to happen is that he's going to be reattacked by McGlockton.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, after protests, Drejka was charged with manslaughter by the state attorney's office. At trial, his lawyer asserted Drejka was defending himself but didn't invoke the \"stand your ground\" law.\n\nJurors took six hours to settle on the verdict. During deliberations, the jurors sent the judge a note saying they were confused by the self-defense law, according to the AP. The judge said he could only read them the law again.\n\nWhen the guilty verdict was announced, the Tampa Bay Times reports, \"In the front row of the gallery, McGlockton's girlfriend, Britany Jacobs, threw up her hands and clapped. A woman broke into sobs. McGlockton's father pressed his elbows into his knees as supporters squeezed his shoulder. His mother embraced family.\"\n\nThe judge ordered Drejka to be held in custody until sentencing. He could get up to 30 years in prison.", "description": "Michael Drejka, who is white, shot and killed Markeis McGlockton, an unarmed black man, who had pushed him to the ground.", "authors": ["Barbara Campbell"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/08/23/ap_18267745026732_wide-1a02fd323f48472852ed65c59137156c65d5086d.jpg?s=1400"}
