They were replaced by what is essentially airline food: microwaved, individual-sized meals, heated from frozen storage.\n\nAmtrak's leadership, to their credit was up-front with passengers about the need for change: the company has a mandate from Congress to save money, especially in the dining cars. But a remark by Andrew Wilander, Amtrak's head of customer experience, in late September, rubbed riders the wrong way.\n\n\"We want to simplify the process,\" he told the Washington Post. \"On the single-overnight, long-distance trains, we have a mandate from Congress to take the loss on the food down, and we're going to keep driving that down. The simplest way to do that is to go to a single food car and then have choice for customers.\"\n\nThe backlash was nearly instantaneous, with a petition to save the dining car's previous service racking up more than 13,000 signatures by the time of writing.\n\nOn Tuesday, I set out on a cross-country Amtrak trip of my own to find out why, among other things, the dining car was such a favorite of rail fans around the country. And it was clear when I first sat down why the changes had left a bad taste in some peoples' mouths.", "description": "Gone are the days of custom-cooked meals on some long-distance Amtrak routes.
