The boy , six, was among the 26 victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012\n\nJames Fetzer (pictured in court Tuesday) must pay the amount but he still insists the defamatory claims are true\n\nIn court video obtain by Channel3000.com, Pozner said: 'It causes people to believe I lied about my son\u2019s death, that my son didn\u2019t die and that I\u2019m somehow doing that for some other reason.'\n\nThe dad - who did not want to be pictured for fear of threats - claimed he was defamed in four separate instances in the 2015 book and on Fetzer's blog in 2018. Fetzer was found guilty in three of the instances.\n\nPozner admitted he said 'a lot of ugly things' after he felt pressured to post his son's death certificate on a Facebook page set up in Noah's memory. He said it was an attempt to be transparent and to defend his son, however things got worse from there.\n\nAttorney Genevieve Zimmerman said in closing arguments that the conspiracy spread by the professor emeritus of philosophy was 'alt-right opium'.\n\n'It went around the internet like a virus,' Wisconsin State Journal reports Zimmerman said. 'This kind of alt-right fact that they want to believe is fact.'\n\nPozner said he had been harassed online and via telephone over the conspiracy. A woman named Lucy Richards was sentenced to five month in prison in 2017 for leaving voicemails telling him 'death is coming to you real soon' and two were played in court.\n\nThe father said his two daughters were with him at the time of hearing the messages and he was concerned too for their safety.\n\nA forensic psychiatrist said that the conspiracy theories contributed to Pozner's PTSD and that Fetzer's claims in particular were 'a key part of why he is still suffering'.\n\nFetzer and Mike Palacek (pictured left) claimed in their book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook (right) that it was staged by federal government under Obama admin for tight gun restrictions\n\n'But were it not for the denial of the death of his son, the harassment and threats, he would have healed and been having a relatively normal life several years ago and he wouldn\u2019t continue to have post-traumatic stress disorder,' Dr. Roy Lubit testified on a pro bono basis for the plaintiff.\n\nFetzer called the damages amount 'absurd' and said he would appeal. He still insists the claims made in the book - now removed by Amazon - are true. He has now made the book available to read for free online.\n\nFetzer's lawyer Richard Bolton denied that his client's actions contributed to the PTSD, arguing that Pozner 'basically said that he's afraid because other people have threatened him, but that's not an element or a symptom of PTSD'.\n\nCo-author Palacek reached a settlement with Pozner last month, terms of which were not disclosed.\n\nPozner thanked the jury 'for recognizing the pain and terror that Mr. Fetzer has purposefully inflicted on me and on other victims of these horrific mass casualty events, like the Sandy Hook shooting,' and emphasized that his case was not about First Amendment protections, the Wisconsin State Journal reported.\n\nFetzer (pictured left and right) has now made the book available to read online for free after it was removed from Amazon\n\n'Mr. Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened,' he said. 'He has the right to express his ignorance. This award, however, further illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr. Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror.'\n\nPozner testified during the trial that he's been repeatedly harassed by people who don't believe the Sandy Hook shooting occurred, including through messages posted to photos of his son on a memorial website.\n\nHe said Fetzer's writing caused him to worry about his safety and his family's safety and how his surviving children could be treated.\n\nOne of his two daughters is Noah's twin.", "description": "James Fetzer must pay Leonard Pozner, whose 6-year-old son Noah was among the 26 victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19792956-0-image-a-6_1571240833491.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
