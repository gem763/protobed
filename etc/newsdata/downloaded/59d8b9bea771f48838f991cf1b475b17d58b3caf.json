It has been a great event in Shenzhen, and it's the biggest WTA event of the year.\n\n\"This is not how I wanted to end this tournament or my season. I look forward to getting healthy and hope to be back here in Shenzhen next year.\"\n\nDutchwoman Bertens made her debut at the WTA Finals last year, reaching the semi-finals before losing to eventual champion Elina Svitolina.\n\nShe reached a career-high ranking of four in May and currently sits 10th having lost to Aryna Sabalenka in the final of the WTA Elite Trophy last weekend.", "description": "Naomi Osaka has withdrawn from the WTA Finals in Shenzhen because of a right shoulder injury.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Judy Murray", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214313056-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqGw_8_YqFn6oOhW46YSWn9SnJ5Axt_dPFfgBF_QqPcg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
