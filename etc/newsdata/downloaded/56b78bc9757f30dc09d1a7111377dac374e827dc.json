The protesters argued that the legislation is desperately needed as the country begins to feel the effects of climate change, citing intensifying wildfires in the senator's state.\n\nThe group also momentarily occupied the office of Sen.

A similar resolution introduced in the Republican-led Senate failed to pass on a floor vote.\n\nThe Sunrise protesters voiced frustration about the level of congressional inaction on climate change so far. Despite Democrats gaining control of the House in 2018, critics have largely been disappointed by the lack of legislation put forward.\n\nPierce said that while the Green New Deal may not offer immediate action for the fires, it continues to offer Democrats a strong option on climate action, something important looking to 2020.\n\n\u201cI think the Green New Deal is the government agenda we see in a decadelong overhaul. I don\u2019t think I see it as a single policy plan or tunnel vision but as a solution that meets the climate crisis at the scale of the problem by covering all facets of society,\u201d Pierce said.\n\n\"By tackling all those things under one governing agenda, we have the power to really invigorate the base of the Democratic Party, bring in lots of new voters, mobilize the youth and win this election in 2020,\u201d she added.", "description": "Youth protesters occupied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-Calif.) office Wednesday afternoon, demanding climate action as a number of fires continue to rage in California.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pelosinancy_101719gn12_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
