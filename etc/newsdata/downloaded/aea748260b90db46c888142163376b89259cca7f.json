who mentored Little Mix - to pay her former landlord more than \u00a370,000, plus the legal costs of the action, after striking out her defence due to her failure to comply with earlier court orders.\n\nTulisa moved into the three-bedroom penthouse apartment in Enfield, North London, in 2014\n\nJudge Saunders told Miss Contostavlos she must pay up, despite her legal team blaming the failure to follow court orders on a 'breakdown in communication' between her and her solicitor whilst she was overseas.\n\nThe court heard that pitta bakery tycoon Mr Charalambous, 44, leased his 'brand new, pristine three-bedroomed apartment' to Miss Contostavlos in September 2014 for a monthly rent of \u00a33,466.\n\n'In July 2016, she returned it to him in what he alleges was an appalling - unlettable - condition,' claimed Mr Thorowgood.\n\nMr Charalambous then sued for the costs of repairing damage done and 'the loss of the replacement tenant to whom he had agreed to let the flat after she vacated it'.\n\nPart of the alleged harm done consisted of damage to carpets and household items, the court heard, with Mr Charalambous complaining that a fridge door had been 'pulled off'.\n\nThe singer denied she had caused the damage to the luxury flat in Enfield, North London\n\nMr Thorowgood claimed that even on the pop star's case it was clear she owed her landlord a substantial cash sum for the trail of havoc.\n\n'It is absolutely clear from the nature of some of the items which are admitted - such as the stains and cigarette burns on the carpets, the sink in the bathroom being smashed and the cigarette burns on the bath - that she did not look after this property as she should have done,' said the barrister.\n\nMiss Contostavlos denies breaching the terms of her lease, her barrister, Mark Brittain, explained.\n\n'It is alleged that my client left this property in a bit of a mess, but she says she did not,' he told the judge.\n\n'Her defence is that she denies that any damage was caused by her or that any damage is over and above normal wear and tear.'\n\nThe star had agreed to pay \u00a33,466-a-month in rent and signed a tenancy agreement in which she promised to pay for any damage or repairs needed because of her 'negligence or misuse'\n\nThe judge dismissed her challenge to a previous ruling which had 'struck out' her defence due to non-compliance with crucial court orders and had awarded Mr Charalambous \u00a370,832 compensation - including interest.\n\nThe court orders mainly concerned directions for preparing evidence about the alleged toll of damage done in the flat.\n\nMr Charalambous' lawyers argued that 'no proper or satisfactory explanation for the breaches has been given'.\n\n'Insofar as any explanation is proffered, it is that she is an artiste who can't be bothered to keep in touch with/pay her solicitor,' his barrister said in court documents.\n\nAnd he told the court: 'It is obvious what happened here: my client let his beautiful new apartment and Miss Contostavlos, who is a pop star, had a lot of parties there.'\n\nThe landlord said the penthouse apartment was in 'pristine' condition when she moved in\n\n'You don't know that,' the judge pointed out.\n\n'But my client should not have to carry the can,' replied Mr Thorowgood.\n\nMs Contostavlos' legal team blamed the failure to follow court orders on a 'breakdown in communication' between her and her solicitor while she was working overseas.\n\nThis 'prevented him from obtaining instructions in time to comply with the order,' they claimed.\n\nMr Brittain urged the judge to give his client a last chance to defend her case, adding: 'The effect of refusing relief from sanction produces the most serious result possible, it will effectively mean she loses.'\n\nMiss Contostavlos said there was nothing more than 'normal wear and tear' to the property\n\nMuch of the evidence in the case was straightforward, he argued.\n\nBut the judge was unconvinced and told the court: 'The suggestion that this delay was due to these reasons is weak.\n\n'It is well established that contact can be made with individuals in this country by either mobile phone or email.\n\n'It may well be that Ms Contostavlos has an agent but, even if not, being abroad is not a bar to remaining in touch with her solicitor - particularly when she is aware of the importance of this case, which involves a substantial amount of money.'\n\nThe trial of Mr Charalambous' claim was originally fixed to go ahead on October 29, but Judge Saunders' ruling means the landlord has now won his case against the singer.\n\nTulisa pictured with Fazer (left) and Dappy (right) as N-Dubz at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2010\n\nMiss Contostavlos must now pay him a total of \u00a370,832 - including interest - and shoulder the legal costs of the action.\n\nBut neither she nor her former landlord were in court for the final hearing of the case.\n\nMiss Contostavlos successfully mentored the girl band Little Mix while a judge on X Factor in 2011.\n\nShe originally became a star with the Camden-based band N-Dubz over ten years ago, and in July released her latest solo single, Sippin'.", "description": "Landlord Andrew Charalambous said Tulisa Contostavlos left cigarette burns in the bathtub, and stains and more cigarette burns on carpets in the brand new flat in Enfield, North London.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/19480612-0-image-a-15_1570607963795.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
