Come over here you\u2019ll be caught by the neck, that chicken neck. You don\u2019t fool me,\u201d said Mr Gracie, a 52-year-old mixed martial arts fighter appointed to public office last month by Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's far-right president.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I've met many gays more manly than this imbecile.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Amazon rainforest swept by fires: In pictures Show all 25 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

wife.\n\nIn a post on Mr Bolsonaro's Facebook page, a user insulted the 66-year-old French first lady by comparing her appearance with that of Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s wife, Michelle, implying the younger woman was more attractive.\n\nThe supporter suggested Mr Macron was jealous, and that that was why he was \u201cpersecuting\u201d the Brazilian leader. Mr Bolsonaro hit \u201clike\u201d on the post, writing: \"Don't humiliate the guy ... ha ha.\"\n\nAsked about alleged derogatory comments he himself had made about Brigitte, Mr Gracie called Mr Macron's wife a \u201cdragon\u201d.\n\n\"I'll ask you a question, is his wife pretty or ugly? Would you do her? If you criticise our country, get ready to listen to a load of bulls***, and also about your relatives. The fact that he is sleeping with the dragon does not make him a fire expert. She\u2019s ugly, my brother,\u201d he said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In return, Mr Macron questioned the Brazilian president\u2019s trustworthiness and commitment to protecting biodiversity.", "description": "Brazil's\u00a0tourism ambassador\u00a0has threatened to choke Emmanuel Macron and called his wife Brigitte \u201cugly\u201d amid a continuing war of words between the French president and the Brazilian government over the fires in the Amazon rainforest.", "authors": ["Tom Embury-Dennis"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/08/18/macron.jpg"}
