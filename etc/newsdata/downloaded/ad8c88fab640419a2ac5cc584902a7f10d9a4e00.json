'I've waited three years for a trial that lasted nearly three weeks. Three years since I was assaulted by my boss at work. 'Three years I've been waiting for justice against a man who thinks he can act any way he wants and not be held accountable. 'And after three years, I finally felt heard by a jury of my peers. I finally felt seen. I want to thank the men and women who sat in a courtroom for three weeks and heard my story and felt my pain. 'The reason I stood up for myself wasn't about money or suing a billionaire, it was about stopping him from doing this to other women. I don't want anyone to go through what I went through. Every woman deserves to feel safe at work. It's unacceptable for any man in a position of power to make a female employee worry she'll be harassed or assaulted. 'It doesn't matter what industry or field you work in, you should feel safe going to work. 'I've been in therapy the last three years to find out why I'm fearful of men after being assaulted. He should go to therapy. 'During the trial he chose to show a video where he picked a woman up and put her in a trash can\u2026 I can't think of anything more symbolic of how he treats women like garbage. So, Time's Up, Alki David.'\n\nThroughout the trial, David had been asked to leave the courtroom on numerous occasions as he defended the claims made against him as examples of 'shock' humor.\n\nIn once instance, the billionaire had argued that his behavior was merely making Reeves aware of the shocking nature of the content he would want her to produce for his media companies.\n\nHe was also said to have shouted insults at Reeves and her attorney Nathan Goldberg throughout the trial.\n\nGoldberg had initially asked the jury for $30 million, which he claimed was a large enough number to teach the Coca Cola heir a 'lesson'.\n\nOn Tuesday, David was ordered to pay $4.35 million in punitive damages and Reeves was awarded $650,000 in compensatory damages on Friday.\n\nSpeaking after the verdict was read, David, who did not appear in court, insisted Reeves will not 'get one cent' of the money she was awarded.\n\nHe said: 'This number is absurd. But any award is absurd in this case, which is based on lies.\n\n'I will keep fighting these con artists and I will prevail. We will win this on appeal and I'll say it again: These people will not get one cent out of me.'\n\nIn April, David was ordered to pay $8 million in damages to another former employee, Chastity Jones, over accusations of sexual battery and sexual assault.\n\nDuring the trial, the media mogul had stormed out of the courtroom shouting 'You are a\u2026 liar, you are disgusting' as Jones' attorney Lisa Bloom presented evidence.\n\nThe outburst came immediately after Bloom announced that her client, 42, would be seeking $10million in damages.\n\nA source told DailyMail.com the mogul was angry that the first day of the hearing was biased and all based on the accuser's claims.\n\nIn David's wake, Bloom warned the jury they had just captured a glimpse of the Greek's unpredictable temperament.\n\nEllyn Garofalo, David's attorney, said that Jones only made allegations against the business mogul after she was fired from positions at two of his companies, Hologram USA and FilmOn.TV.\n\nBefore that, Garofalo claimed that Jones always spoke very highly of her employer, regularly telling associates that she loved her job working in a 'wild and outrageous place', where sexual innuendo wasn't uncommon.\n\nAlong with another former sales accountant, Jones first filed a lawsuit against David in February 2017, claiming she was ousted from the companies for 'refusing to have sex' with him.\n\nDuring the hearing, Bloom detailed a series of alleged instances in which David was deemed to have acted inappropriately towards Jones, making her feel uncomfortable.\n\nShortly after assuming her sales position in January 2015, Jones claimed that David came up behind her, placed his hands on her shoulders and told her to follow him on Instagram.\n\nThroughout the trial, David had been asked to leave the courtroom on numerous occasions as he defended the claims made against him as examples of 'shock' humor\n\nThe single-mother says she pulled away and said no, but apparently David repeated the interaction several days later.\n\nBloom showed the jury one of David's alleged Instagram postings containing a photo depicting Caitlyn Jenner with a stunned look on her face with a caption that read, 'When you play with your vagina for the first time.'\n\nAs Bloom went on to describe another instance in which her client voiced discomfort, regarding a male stripper dressed as a policeman hired to come to the office, David was heard laughing as Bloom referred to Jones as a 'Christian woman'.", "description": "Lauren Reeves, left,\u00a0issued a statement Wednesday after she was\u00a0awarded $4.35M Tuesday.
