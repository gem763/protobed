But anyway, Yandy is no doubt grateful for the Twitter Puritans, since we know that the company openly tries to one-up themselves every Halloween, in terms of sparking pearl-clutching and complaints with whatever subject they decide to sexify (an official term, I imagine).\n\nLast year, it was a sexy Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2013inspired \u201cRed Maiden\u201d costume that put people over the edge, so much so that Yandy ended up yanking the red cloak/fishnets/bonnet costume set from their site. Before that, they pushed the limit with Sexy Ken Bone, Sexy Cecil the Lion, Sexy Slenderman \u2026 the list goes on.\n\nI for one am always in awe of how Yandy has their finger on the political pulse. 2018\u2019s \u201cAnonymous Op-Ed\u201d and \u201cCloudy Affair,\u201d an homage to Stormy Daniels, are far more incisive and satirically brilliant than most political humor columns. In 2019, they\u2019ve upped the ante in this regard, too, with a \u201cSexy Tariff\u201d dress that will no doubt spark some very high-minded discussions of what Trump is doing to strain our relationship with China, in many, many foam parties throughout this nation.", "description": "Notorious Halloween retailer Yandy has outdone themselves yet again by making a \u201csexy\u201d Mr. Rogers costume, and igniting the internet debate they count on every year.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/19/19-yandy-mr-rogers.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
