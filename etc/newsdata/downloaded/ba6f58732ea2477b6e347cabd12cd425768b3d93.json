REUTERS/Kevin Lam/File Photo\n\nInvestors have long viewed Singapore as an island of stability that attracts the super-rich from its less developed Southeast Asian neighbors, as well as multimillionaires from mainland China.\n\nIn the first eight months of 2019, 68 condominium units in the wealthy Asian city-state were sold for S$10 million and more, the highest tally since the corresponding period of 2008.\n\nSales of such apartments also exceeded the numbers racked up for each full year from 2011 to 2018, the consultants\u2019 analysis of transaction data shows.\n\nSome buyers may have sought an alternative to rival financial hub Hong Kong, hit by protests, while others may have shifted funds from China after its yuan currency was devalued in a trade war with the United States, an OrangeTee expert said.\n\n\u201cThis may explain why we have observed more foreign buyers, especially mainland Chinese, coming into Singapore lately,\u201d said Christine Sun, its head of research and consultancy.\n\nMainland Chinese are the biggest group of foreign buyers of Singapore luxury homes.\n\nIn Singapore\u2019s prime districts, Chinese citizens bought 76 apartments worth more than S$5 million in the period from January to August, versus 75 purchases by Singaporeans, data until Sept. 19 show.\n\nExpensive apartments in premium neighborhoods are mainly bought by foreigners, because at such high prices Singaporeans have the option to buy landed property, such as bungalows and mansions.\n\nSingapore does not allow foreigners to buy landed homes, except for those on the resort island of Sentosa.\n\n\u201cWe do see that even though the stamp duties have increased .... we are still seeing people putting big money on these apartments, predominantly it is more for stability than anything else,\u201d said Boon Hoe Leong, chief operating officer of high-end realtor List Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\nHe was referring to measures Singapore adopted last year to cool its real estate market, such as hiking additional stamp duties for foreign buyers to 20% from 15%.\n\n\u201cThey are parking their money here - they know that the Sing dollar won\u2019t depreciate overnight,\u201d he added.", "description": "Sales of Singapore apartments worth at least S$10 million ($7.3 million) have hit an 11-year high, fueled by increased demand from Chinese millionaires seeking safe-haven assets, say property consultants OrangeTee & Tie.", "authors": ["Aradhana Aravindan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431895738&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0GV", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
