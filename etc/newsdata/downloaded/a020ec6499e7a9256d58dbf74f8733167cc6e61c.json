Let's check out the latest charts and indicators for VMW.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of VMW, below, we can see that prices made a steep three-month correction from June to September. Prices sank from $190 to $130 before prices rebounded. VMW is now trading above the rising 50-day moving average line. Prices are below the rising 200-day moving average line but a close above $170 will change that.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is incredibly bullish as it did not decline from June to September when prices declined. Buyers were more aggressive even as prices sank. The OBV line could soon make a new high even though VMW is well off its best levels.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line which is bullish.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of VMW, below, we see a positive-looking picture. Prices are still below the rising 40-week moving average line but a weekly close above $170 will change that.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows no weakness the past year and is thus very bullish, in my opinion. The MACD oscillator just crossed to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly Point and Figure chart of VMW, below, we can see an upside price target of $182 being projected.\n\nBottom-line strategy: I favor the upside on VMW with prices heading back up to retest its July highs for starters. Risk below $145 for now.", "description": "VMware Stock Is Ready to Rally Back to Its July Highs...MSFT", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Vmware Is Ready To Rally Back To Its July Highs", "Favor The Upside On This Cloud Stock.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Jim Cramer", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/45999c24-c524-11e9-848d-af478651c446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
