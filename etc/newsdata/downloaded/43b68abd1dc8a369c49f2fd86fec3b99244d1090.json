When the supersonic parachute deployed at around Mach 2.4, the drag produced a tear in the material, NASA said at the time, and the saucer made a hard landing in the Pacific just 12 minutes later.\n\nGovernment researchers sounded upbeat about what the project taught them, nonetheless.\n\nThe physics involved \"is so cutting-edge we learn something profound every time we test,\" said Ian Clark, principal investigator for the saucer project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBureaucracy at Work is the story of how the government wastes your money and micromanages your life.", "description": "NASA's Low Density Supersonic Decelerator project burned through $222 million before it was mothballed, Sen.
