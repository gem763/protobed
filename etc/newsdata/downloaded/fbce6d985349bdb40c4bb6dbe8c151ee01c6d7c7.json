However, from our liaison with Australian companies, we do know that some companies have lowered their hurdle rates and this is opening up new opportunities for them. It would be good to hear more such reports.\"\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg has already repeatedly urged companies to invest in the growth of their businesses rather than rewarding their shareholders with special dividends and buybacks.\n\nWhile some have suggested cutting interest rates three times this year to a record low 0.75 per cent was hurting consumer confidence, Dr Lowe said the central bank would have hurt the economy even more had it not eased monetary policy and adjusted to a world of lower interest rates.\n\n\"If we did seek to ignore these trends, the exchange rate would most likely appreciate. In the current environment, this would be unhelpful for both jobs growth and for achieving the inflation target,\" Dr Lowe said.\n\n\"We are confident that these reductions are helping the Australian economy and supporting the gentle turning point in economic growth.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The key to a return to more normal interest rates globally is to improve the investment climate.\"\n\nDr Lowe reiterated what he told a high-powered forum at the International Monetary Fund last week, that the bank was \"prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed\".\n\n\"Having said that, it is extraordinarily unlikely that we will see negative interest rates in Australia,\" Dr Lowe said.\n\n'Take Melville\u2019s cue'\n\nDr Lowe, who delivered his speech at the Sir Leslie Melville Lecture at Australian National University in Canberra, pointed to the work done on zero interest rates by Sir Leslie and his calls for business to make use of them for investment.\n\nSir Leslie was Australia's executive director of both the World Bank and the IMF and was chief economic adviser to the Commonwealth Bank for 23 years.\n\n\"The focus needs to be on an improvement in the investment environment, so that investors are prepared to take Melville\u2019s cue and use low funding costs to build new productive assets,\" Dr Lowe said. \"Not only would this help assist with a return to more normal interest rates, but it would be good for our collective welfare too.\"\n\n\"[Sir Leslie] went on to write that at zero interest: 'Roads would be levelled and straightened regardless of cost. In some places mountains would be dug away and valleys filled to provide residential and agricultural land. Deserts would be watered, beaches would be built in places accessible to cities and provided with artificial sea and sunlight.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I found it surprising to read this \u2013 not just because of the obvious engineering challenges, but because in other writings Melville was very sceptical about public works and public debt. Understandably, he wanted public money to be spent wisely.\"\n\nDr Lowe has called upon both federal and state government to borrow at record low costs and spend money on infrastructure.\n\nDr Lowe did raise fresh concerns about persistently low inflation.\n\nExpectations of high inflation, he said, had been \"wrung out\" of the system and such low inflation \"provides fertile ground for the emergence of some financial stability risks\".", "description": "Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has pressured business and government to wake up to the opportunity of cheaper credit by lowering high return hurdles and starting to invest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2163%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_13%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/aeff7ce0c7230da69feb46c2bcef1f72cdc8247e", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
