Both swapped quick laps to top the times as a dry line began to emerge.\n\nLittle of note happened until the closing stages when, with 15 minutes remaining, Kimi Raikkonen was the first driver to switch to slick softs on his Alfa Romeo.\n\nHe was immediately fastest until fellow-Finn Bottas, on mediums, outpaced him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest followed in a blur of activity that included Gasly trying a lap to settle his stomach and Albon lapping quickest until Verstappen trimmed his time followed by Sainz and Bottas in the final minutes.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Charles Leclerc topped the times ahead of his Ferrari team mate Sebastian Vettel to push the title-scrapping Mercedes men down to third and fourth in Saturday's third and final free practice for Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9138/f14b408a5dec42e089bad15e70fe1b99.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
