This guy is a star. \ud83d\udc4a pic.twitter.com/7RMrm9I3MH \u2014 UFC on BT Sport (@btsportufc) October 6, 2019\n\nAdesanya attended the post-fight press conference with his new belt, but the media briefing was interrupted when he received a call from his cousin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a bit tipsy,\u2019 Adesanya told the press, before letting his cousin know he was on TV.\n\nAdesanya had his family cageside for the fight and paid tribute to his parents by placing the belt at their feet when they joined him in the cage to celebrate.\n\nMiddleweight contender Paulo Costa was also in attendance for the fight and was the subject of two middle fingers from Adesanya.\n\nIn a unusual walk-out, Adesanya announced himself to the Melbourne crowd with a choreographed dance routine.\n\n\u2018Nobody is doing anything like I\u2019m doing,\u2019 Adesanya said after his victory.\n\nAdesanya danced and flipped his way to the cage before aiming the finger at his rivals (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018This is a 60,000-seat arena. People, after seeing that entrance, I bet you the green-eyed monsters were like, \u201cI f***ing hope this guy loses. I f***ing hope\u201d.\n\n\u2018I saw some you in here as well, \u201cThis a**hole, look at him. Thinks he\u2019s the f***ing man. I hope he loses. I hope he gets flatlined\u201d.\n\n\u2018Because that\u2019s just that\u2014It\u2019s ingrained in us. It\u2019s this tall poppy syndrome, it\u2019s this jealousy that when you see someone shining you feel like it takes away from your own shine.\n\n\u2018Look, I can\u2019t dim my shine just because some people feel uncomfortable. Everything went full circle tonight.\u2019\n\nMORE: Dustin Poirier turns down Dan Hooker clash because he\u2019s \u2018fighting Conor McGregor next\u2019", "description": "Israel Adesanya briefly halted his press conference to take a call from one of his elated family members.
