The investigations of Attorney General William Barr, U.S. Attorney John Durham as well as the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz are the key to understanding what is really going on here.\n\nThe hoax of impeachment by the Democrats is to prevent what they know will be exposed of their deep-state corruption. Mitt Romney knows what will be exposed of his family\u2019s corruption. These strange bedfellows of Mr. Romney, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, John Kerry, the Clintons, the Clinton Foundation, Uranium One and probably others all reportedly have the same thing in common: Their family relations cashed in on their notoriety in Ukraine, Russia or China to makes millions (and in Hunter Biden\u2019s case, reportedly at least $1.5 billion). How? Through the overt or covert solicitation by the powerful, politically connected lobbying efforts of their elected family members.\n\nThis is the real, under-the-radar, dirty little secret they are afraid will become front-page news should Messrs. Barr, Durham and Horowitz proceed to the conclusions of their investigations. The deep-state expose of \u201cAmerica for Sale\u201d deflection has nothing to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call and everything to do with the decades-long corruption by the political ruling class.\n\nDeep state, be very afraid because the gig is up. You know it and \u201cWe, the People\u201d know it. Mr. President, drain that swamp.\n\nAL QUARTARARO\n\nVirginia Beach, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
