And number two, this is 'unidentified alien phenomena'.\"\n\nUFO VIDEOS ARE FOOTAGE OF REAL 'UNIDENTIFIED' OBJECTS, US NAVY ACKNOWLEDGES\n\nPope said that the U.S government has previously reportedly called such alleged spacecraft \"advanced unknown aircraft.\"\n\nTo that, Carlson said the new videos should be bigger news nationwide.\n\n\"Why is this not page-one news everywhere?\" he asked.\n\nPope agreed there should be more focus on finding the truth behind the new videos.\n\nFORMER BLINK-182 GUITARIST TOM DELONGE TALKS HIS QUEST TO PROVE ALIENS EXIST\n\n\"These aircraft carriers that many of these UFOs have been interacting with -- obviously these are billion-dollar assets -- and if the official position of the most powerful Navy in the world is frankly little more than 'we don't know what this is', I don't think that's good enough,\" he responded.\n\nHe urged Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., -- who he said has expressed interest in investigating the matter -- to request a classified briefing.\n\nDeLonge, who quit pop-punk group Blink 182 in 2015, started the To the Stars Academy with the mission of \"advancing our current understanding of scientific phenomena and its technological implications,\" per its website. One of the tracks from the band's hit 1999 album \"Enema of the State\" is also titled \"Aliens Exist.\"\n\n\u201cThe Navy considers the phenomena contained/depicted in those three videos as unidentified,\" Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher told The Black Vault, a website dedicated to declassified government documents.\n\nGradisher added that \u201cthe \u2018Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\u2019 terminology is used because it provides the basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe statement has been corroborated with other media outlets. Fox News has reached out to the Navy for additional comment for this story.\n\nThe videos in question, known as \"FLIR1,\u201d \u201cGimbal\u201d and \u201cGoFast,\u201d were originally released to the New York Times and to The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (TTSA). In December 2017, Fox News reported that the Pentagon had secretly set up a program to investigate UFOs at the request of former Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.\n\nFox News' Chris Ciaccia and Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "The Pentagon appears to have changed its description of unidentified flying phenomena, after a former Blink-182 singer released three UFO videos that were later published by the New York Times, according to a former British Defense official.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/694940094001_6087230850001_6087228353001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
