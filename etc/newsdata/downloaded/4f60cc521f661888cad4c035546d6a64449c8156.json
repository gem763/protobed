When people fail to tackle their debt until it is of significant worry to them, they find it much more difficult to get out of a spiral of debt.\u201d\n\nThe poll also found the average respondent had a total debt, excluding student loans and mortgages, of \u00a36,936.\n\nThat included two credit cards with a total balance of \u00a31,871.\n\nOne in five said they tended to dip into their overdraft during a typical month.\n\nThree quarters said a mortgage was an example of good debt and a further 47 per cent said the same about student loans.\n\nBut while 61 per cent said dipping into your overdraft constituted bad borrowing, 18 per cent said it is \"good debt\".\n\nSix in 10 said credit card debt is \"debt you don't want\".\n\nHowever, 46 per cent of those polled said they find it \"unusual\" when someone does not have a credit card.\n\nA third of British people have borrowed money to buy a car, one in 10 have taken a loan to go on holiday and 15 per cent have borrowed cash to pay off other debts, according to the survey.\n\nMr Sarkar added: \u201cThe survey shows that people should be careful they don\u2019t take a wider acceptance of debt as a reason to get out of control with their finances. Not only does this lead to a spiral of debt and exclusion from many normal borrowing routes, but it also impacts on wellbeing, with people more likely to suffer from stress and even depression.\n\nSWNS", "description": "The average Briton\u00a0does not\u00a0begin to worry about their debt until it hits \u00a36,012, according to a new survey.\u00a0 The poll of 2,000 adults also found more than one in six would need to owe more than \u00a310,000 before they start\u00a0to feel seriously concerned\u00a0about their debt.\u00a0 The average respondent\u00a0only\u00a0considered\u00a0themselves to be \"in debt\"\u00a0once they were \u00a33,882 in the red.", "authors": ["Gemma Francis"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/28/12/debt-bills.jpg"}
