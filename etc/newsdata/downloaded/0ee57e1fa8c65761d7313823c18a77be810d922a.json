Trump became the 45th President of the United States on Jan. 20, WhiteHouse.gov took down a webpage dedicated to fighting climate change and replaced it with \"An America First Energy Plan.\" Shares\n\nEPA is putting American workers first When President Trump came to EPA to sign an executive order ending the \"war on coal,\" he was flanked by Pennsylvania coal miners. Hosting coal miners at EPA headquarters in Washington served as a stark contrast to the past administration, to be sure. Shares\n\nAn 'America First' energy policy holds 3 powerful benefits The Department of the Interior is the steward and manager of America's natural resources, which in addition to national parks and grazing lands also includes oil, gas, clean coal, hydro, solar and other renewable energy sources. Shares\n\nUnleashing America's energy potential -- in all forms This is a great day for Texas energy diversity [and] the development of these clean technologies ... Shares\n\nTwin energy imperatives: Upgrading infrastructure, strengthening cybersecurity It is not an exaggeration to suggest that our economy, our national security and our way of life all depend on the reliable, secure and efficient operation of energy infrastructure ... Shares\n\nEnergy goals: Jobs, production, modern infrastructure -- and good environmental stewardship American consumers deserve safe, secure and efficient energy that's affordable and meets the needs of the 21st century economy. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce has already begun work on a pro-domestic energy policy that will improve our nation's energy infrastructure, create jobs and reduce energy bills, but much more needs to be done. Shares\n\nFossil fuels are vital to America's energy future President Trump's commitment to fossil fuels could mark a turning point in America's energy future. Certainly, expanded federal support for coal, natural gas and petroleum would create jobs for workers engaged in field construction, coal mining, petroleum and natural gas extraction, transportation and other industries. Shares\n\nUA workers: Ready for 'epic' energy, infrastructure resurgence The United Association of Plumbers, Pipefitters, Sprinklerfitters, Welders and HVAC Technicians (UA) is a multi-craft union that represents over 340,000 members in the United States and Canada. Our members are engaged in the fabrication, installation and servicing of piping systems and many of them work at refineries, power-generating facilities and petrochemical plants. Shares\n\nFuel cells -- The 'Triple Crown' winner for America's energy future America appears divided about almost everything, but there are three generally accepted goals that transcend partisanship: energy independence, environmental stewardship and America's economic security. Today's rapidly growing fuel cell industry plays a role in achieving all three \u2014 a true Triple Crown contender. Shares\n\nThe need for federal energy innovation The human genome project, shale gas revolution, nuclear energy, touchscreens and the discovery of dinosaur extinction have something in common: They all owe their success to the Department of Energy and its predecessors. Shares\n\nNatural gas, plus renewables, light the path toward a bright energy future The global energy landscape continues to experience dramatic changes as we approach the third decade of the 21st century, providing us with immense opportunities to strengthen the energy sector \u2014 and our nation. Advancements in technology have made natural gas more abundant, renewable energy sources more accessible and enabled energy companies to fine-tune their solutions to address specific needs and desires of customers. Shares\n\nWhy it's a critical -- and ideal -- time to upgrade America's energy infrastructure Our nation's aging infrastructure is in significant need of investment and care if we want to ensure a secure future for coming generations. Shares\n\nWind energy: Offering grid reliability, security and diversity Strong national security and a healthy economy share a basic component: access to reliable, affordable energy. Shares\n\nClean coal technologies: Vital for U.S. energy security, export opportunities It remains undeniable that West Virginia and the United States have an abundance of natural resources, and throughout our history, we have used and relied on these resources, particularly coal, to build and defend the nation. But for the last eight years, we had to work with an administration that denied just how important coal is to keeping America secure. Shares\n\nClean coal must be part of our energy future Over the last eight years, America's coal industry has withstood a withering attack from unelected bureaucrats in Washington. While our Constitution makes it clear Congress writes the laws, the president enforces them and the courts interpret them, the Obama administration was determined to impose its radical climate-change agenda by relentlessly governing through executive orders and bypassing Congress. Shares\n\nWhy we can all agree on nuclear energy Renewed interest in nuclear energy is a point of discussion among lawmakers and scientists alike. Of all the topics on which Washington can come together, what is it about nuclear energy that draws us? Shares\n\nYucca Mountain: Finish licensing process on nuclear waste storage As the former deputy general counsel of the Department of Energy during the Reagan administration, serving with Secretary Jim Edwards, I know the department has very competent personnel and we are fortunate for the leadership of Secretary Rick Perry. Shares\n\nThe many benefits of 'turning trash to power' When formulating public policy, regulators and lawmakers should consider the many benefits of using municipal waste as fuel for power generation (aka waste-to-energy technology) \u2014 including cost-competitiveness with other forms of energy, environmental performance that is comparable to natural gas, greenhouse gas reduction, encouragement of recycling programs and greater reliability than many other forms of renewable energy. Shares\n\nU.S. hydropower: Room to grow in renewable energy production and water storage For millennia, humankind has harnessed the power of water. The ancient Romans developed the earliest water wheels to grind grain into flour. In modern times, hydropower emerged as an affordable, clean, and reliable source of renewable energy. Advancing the development of hydroelectricity generation as well as increasing water storage capacity should be a national priority in the interest of American energy independence and drought mitigation. Shares\n\nLook to the U.S. West to see 'all-of-the-above' energy production One of the most commonly discussed themes I've heard during my time in Congress is the idea of an \"all-of-the-above\" energy strategy. This term is tossed around by Republicans and Democrats alike more than a baseball at a Diamondbacks game. Shares\n\nStates' role in the Trump-era energy revolution Throughout the first 100 days of the Trump administration, policymakers in energy-producing states have seen many positive improvements emerging out of Washington, D.C. For example, the onerous Waters of the United States rule, Stream Protection Rule and the Clean Power Plan are all going away. Shares\n\nOil flows into Dakota Access pipeline at long last as project readies for service After nearly a year filled with protests, delays and political machinations, the Dakota Access pipeline has finally been filled with oil. Shares\n\nClean energy powers U.S. economic growth, jobs and lower prices The nation's energy sector is in the midst of a remarkable transformation, providing consumers with far more choices in the way they buy and consume energy. Shares\n\nIt's time to rethink ethanol mandates This year the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has mandated that 15 billion gallons of ethanol be added to gasoline. As a result, most gasoline contains about 10 percent ethanol. Shares\n\nMilitary veterans drawn to ethanol industry; reasons ignite debate over energy independence Military veterans play an outsized role in the corn ethanol industry, but exactly what drives them to the field has become a bone of contention between ethanol proponents and oil and gas industry leaders. Shares\n\nFor first time, U.S. gasoline averaged more than 10% ethanol last year: Report In what industry leaders heralded as proof that the \"blend wall\" is nothing more than a myth, a new study released Wednesday shows that U.S. gasoline contained more than 10 percent ethanol on average for the first time last year. Shares\n\nLeading in the new energy reality Cyclical market volatility will continue to be standard in the energy industry. An impending market rebound has many feeling cautiously optimistic, but the extended cycle of the current downturn \u2014 now being characterized as \"lower for longer\" \u2014 has revealed a new reality in the energy sector that will change leadership imperatives for the foreseeable future. Shares\n\nTwin energy imperatives: Upgrading infrastructure, strengthening cybersecurity The United States has some of the most robust and reliable energy infrastructure in the world. It allows us to harness energy and move it from where it is produced to where it can be utilized. Shares\n\nGreen groups sue Trump over Keystone pipeline Environmental activists on Thursday sued the Trump administration in an effort to stop the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the administration formally approved last week.
