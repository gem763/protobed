This morning, The Verge published leaked audio of an internal Q&A session with Zuckerberg, including a question on Warren\u2019s plan. \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d he responded. \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\u201d\n\nWarren published a cutting response on Twitter. \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhat would really \u201csuck\u201d is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. https://t.co/rI0v55KKAi \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019\n\nWarren didn\u2019t go into specifics about Facebook\u2019s \u201cfumbling\u201d of democracy, but the company has been heavily criticized for indirectly letting political firm Cambridge Analytica access user data as well as failing to curb a Russian misinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential election. It\u2019s already dealing with controversy over how to treat political speech in the upcoming 2020 elections.\n\nFacebook, alongside companies like Google and Amazon, is currently facing multiple antitrust probes. Republican and Democratic politicians have both raised the possibility of spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram into separate companies, but Warren has been one of the most vocal critics of Silicon Valley consolidation \u2014 and if she\u2019s elected, she might pose the biggest threat to Zuckerberg\u2019s empire.", "description": "Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has responded to a leaked transcript from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who was critical of her antitrust plan.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yTs_dXp7L0RB8wt5YBmeE8A4fmg=/0x306:4898x2870/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19249141/1171198004.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
