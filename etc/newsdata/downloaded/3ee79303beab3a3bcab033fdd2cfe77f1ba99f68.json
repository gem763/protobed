In the South, it\u2019s still anyone\u2019s race to win.\n\nA couple of key games this weekend could make the picture clearer. The No. 12 Ducks (5-1, 3-0) visit No. 25 Washington (5-2, 2-2), while No. 17 Arizona State (5-1, 2-1) visits No. 13 Utah (5-1, 2-1).\n\nIf the Ducks win the rest of the way and claim the Pac-12 title, they might have a sliver of a chance to make the College Football Playoff. But it\u2019s a longshot.\n\nThe Utes, favored in the preseason to win the South, dropped a game to USC and now must find a way to separate themselves from a pack of teams that have two wins, including the Sun Devils, the Trojans and Arizona.\n\nThe Associated Press writers covering the Pac-12 voted on the best - and worst - of the league so far. Here are some of the standout teams and players with the second half of the season looming:\n\nCOACH OF THE MIDSEASON: It was unanimous, with Arizona State\u2019s Herm Edwards getting the nod. Edwards surprised many when he led the Sun Devils to a winning record and a bowl game in his first season. This year, he\u2019s showing it might not be a fluke. The Sun Devils are a win away from bowl eligibility again and are right in the thick of the South standings, despite starting a freshman quarterback. Having Eno Benjamin helps, too.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do still. We\u2019re laying bricks, trying to stack them. We have to just keep playing (the freshman) and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. Are we there yet? No. It\u2019s a journey. We\u2019re going to a destination and we haven\u2019t arrived yet but we keep working as hard as we can to get there,\u201d Edwards said this week.\n\nOFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE MIDSEASON: The votes were across the spectrum, with Oregon State\u2019s Isaiah Hodgins standing out despite playing on a team with just two wins overall this season. Washington State\u2019s Anthony Gordon got mentions, too, but more on him later.\n\nHodgins, a junior, ranks fourth nationally with an average of 118.2 receiving yards a game. Oregon State was shut down by Utah\u2019s stout defense in a 52-7 loss last weekend, but Hodgins still managed eight catches for 77 yards. He\u2019s become one of the Beavers\u2019 best offensive weapons, especially with running back Jermar Jefferson hampered by injury.\n\nThe Beavers (2-4, 1-2) visit California (4-2, 1-2) on Saturday.\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE MIDSEASON: Speaking of Cal, linebacker Evan Weaver swept the category. The senior inside linebacker has 84 tackles to lead the nation, and he\u2019s been in double digits for five of the last six games. His career-high 22 tackles at Mississippi earlier this season tied the Golden Bears\u2019 record.\n\nFRESHMAN OF THE MIDSEASON: This one was unanimous, too. Arizona State quarterback Jayden Daniels has surpassed expectations. He\u2019s averaging 301.3 yards of total offense per game, ranking first among freshmen nationally. He\u2019s also averaging 268.3 yards passing to rank among the top 20 quarterbacks overall nationwide. He\u2019s thrown eight touchdowns and just one interception.\n\n\u201cWe recruited him really hard out of high school,\u201d Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. \u201cHe\u2019s a talented kid. He\u2019s not the biggest guy, only about 180 pounds, so he hasn\u2019t filled out yet, but he\u2019s doing a really nice job running the offense.\u201d\n\nSURPRISING PLAYER AT MIDSEASON: It shouldn\u2019t be that much of a surprise considering Mike Leach\u2019s reputation for producing prolific quarterbacks in his system, but Washington State quarterback Anthony Gordon is leading the league - and the nation - in many statistical categories. He ranks first nationally in passing yards (2,612) and average yards per game (435.3), and he ranks second in the country with 25 touchdowns. He\u2019s thrown for 400 or more yards five times this season.\n\nGordon has picked up pretty much where Gardner Minshew left off, except the Cougs aren\u2019t putting up wins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a version of the Air Raid, it\u2019s just a real Air Raid. They really have it down to a science and they have a quarterback that can run it. He can run the offense, he knows how it works and he can put a lot of pressure on your defense,\u201d Colorado coach Mel Tucker said.\n\nThe Cougars (3-3, 0-3) host the Buffaloes (3-3, 1-2) on Saturday.\n\nSURPRISING TEAM AT MIDSEASON: Arizona State is better than most thought, while Washington State has been a disappointment. The Sun Devils were picked to finish third, but if they can stay on track - starting with the Utes this weekend - they might claim the South.\n\nThe Cougars have lost three straight after opening the season 3-0. The slide started with the disastrous 67-63 loss at home to UCLA, during which the Bruins rallied from a 32-point deficit.\n\nDISAPPOINTING PLAYER: More was expected from Dorian Thompson-Robinson in his sophomore season, but a leg injury and a struggling supporting cast have kept UCLA\u2019s quarterback from making more progress. He\u2019s got 11 touchdowns with six interceptions and ranks at the bottom of the league in pass efficiency (137.8). But he had a good outing against the Cougars, throwing for 507 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nUCLA (1-5, 1-2) visits Stanford (3-3, 2-2) on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Pac-12 is a jumble at the halfway point after some surprising early season results but some themes have emerged.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
