By mid-morning, the price was down to around $85 per share.\n\nThe vegan burger maker's quarterly numbers, published after the market closed on Monday, showed its first-ever profit and raised its full-year sales forecast, but also said it would need to offer more discounts as competition heats up for a product that is marketed as better for human health and the environment than meat is.\n\nBernstein analyst Alexia Howard raised doubts on whether the company could scale to a national level its partnership with McDonald's Corp - the world's largest burger chain, which is testing Beyond Meat's vegan burger in Canada.\n\nAt least three Wall Street analysts cut their price target on the stock after the results, with JPMorgan's Goldman reducing his target to $138 from $189.\n\nThe end of the 180-day lock-up period - allowing employees, insiders and other early backers to sell - has been well-advertised. But it also will contribute further to the pool of Beyond Meat shares available after the unusual and unexpected secondary offering of shares by the company in July.\n\n\"Heightened competition from new entries to the plant-based category represents the biggest downside risk to our [price target],\" Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow wrote in a note.\n\n\"We believe that that increased liquidity ... will put the shares into a lower valuation range.\"\n\nOf the 12 analysts who cover Beyond Meat, eight rate it \"hold\", two \"sell\" and only two now suggest buying its shares.", "description": "With many investors free to offload holdings, even an upbeat earnings report could not stop vegan burger maker's dive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/82b7edf1608446b3a45eda8d33fa5dcc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
