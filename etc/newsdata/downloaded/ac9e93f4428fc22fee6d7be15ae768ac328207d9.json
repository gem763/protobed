Launched today at the Geneva Motor Show, the Dendo Drive House (DDH) features solar panels, a home battery, and a bi-directional charger that lets power flow from your home to your car, or from your car to your home \u2014 depending on the economics and which needs the power most. DDH supports cars like the Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer that the company also announced at the show\n\nThere are a number of scenarios when having your car charge your home could be useful. In addition to opening up a world of off-grid living, it could also serve as a backup in the event of a power cut, for example. The system could also be useful if your electricity tariff offers you a discount during off-peak hours, when the electricity grid is under less load and cheaper to use as a result. For example, your car could inexpensively charge itself overnight, and then power your AC during the day. Of course, this will only work if you\u2019re not planning on using the car to make any trips during that time.\n\nThe system supports both pure electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrids like the new Engelberg Tourer and existing Outlander PHEV. Mitsubishi plans on offering both professional installation as well as maintenance services for the system as a package from its dealerships. Self-installation won\u2019t be possible.\n\nMitsubishi is not the only company to have considered using a bi-directional car charger at home. In the UK, the energy supplier OVO announced a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) trial last year, although it lacked the home battery portion of Mitsubishi\u2019s system. Tesla\u2019s original Roadster also supported the functionality before it was removed in later models, and last year its CEO Elon Musk mused that the company could bring it back in the future.\n\nGrid View Mitsubishi\u2019s bi-directional charger, shown here plugged into a Mitsubishi Outlander, was on display at the Geneva Motor Show Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nThe company also announced the Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer, a plug-in hybrid, at the show Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\nHowever, while OVO\u2019s system has only been offered on a trial basis to 1,000 households, and Tesla\u2019s plans are currently just theoretical, Mitsubishi says its system will be available to buy later this year. Don\u2019t expect the system to come cheap however. The bi-directional charger itself could cost as much as \u20ac10,000 (although Mitsubishi says it hopes to be able to sell it more cheaply), and you\u2019ll also need to pay for the solar panels, home battery, and mandatory professional installation.", "description": "Mitsubishi will soon sell a system that lets your share power between your home and electric car.
