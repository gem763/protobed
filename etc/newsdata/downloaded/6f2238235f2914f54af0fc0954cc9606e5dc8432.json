Cruz, R-Tex and Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Sen Tom Cotton, R-Ark. and Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind. also signed the letter.\n\nTed Cruz was one of eight lawmakers signing a letter urging NBA action over its China controversy. (Getty)\n\nConcern over \u2018self-censorship\u2019 in the NBA\n\nThe letter expresses \u201cdeep concern\u201d over statements from the NBA and the Rockets in response to China\u2019s backlash over a tweet from Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting Hong Kong protesters in their conflict with the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned that individuals associated with the league may now engage in self-censorship that is inconsistent with American and the league\u2019s stated values \u2014 and that this incident will only encourage further intimidation of American companies and persons by the Chinese government,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nThe letter, which can be seen in whole here, continues to urge the NBA to \u201cput our fundamental democratic rights ahead of profit,\u201d a reference to the initial response from the Rockets and the NBA that condemned Morey\u2019s tweet as \u201cregrettable.\u201d\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver has since released a statement clarifying the league won\u2019t regulate speech. The league continues to grapple with the situation as state-run media in China is cutting off access of NBA coverage to its 1.4 billion citizens.\n\nStory continues\n\nLawmakers\u2019 suggested actions\n\nThe letter from Congress set out four steps it urged the NBA to take as the league navigates the controversy:\n\n1. Build upon your statement of October 8 in which you said \u201cthe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees, and team owners say or will not say on these issues\u201d by clarifying that (a) NBA players, staff, partners, and fans in the United States are American persons \u2014 as such, you support their right to express their opinions no matter the economic consequences, and (b) while the NBA will follow Chinese law in China, the Chinese Communist Party must respect that the association will abide by American laws and principles in its global operations, including by not conditioning employment on any guidelines of expression on international political issues. 2. Suspend NBA activities in China until government-controlled broadcasters and government-controlled commercial sponsors end their boycott of NBA activities and the selective treatment of the Houston Rockets, and emphasize that the association will stand unified in the face of future efforts by Chinese government-controlled entities to single out individual teams, players, or associates for boycotts or selective treatment. 3. Reevaluate the NBA\u2019s training camp in Xinjiang, where up to a million Chinese citizens are held in concentration camps as part of a massive, government-run campaign of ethno-\u00adreligious repression. 4. Clarify in internal association documents that public commentary on international human rights repression-including in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang-falls within expected standards of public behavior and expression.\n\nThe NBA has a giant mess on its hands with no easy solution in sight and is now getting formal suggestions from the American government on how to solve it.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The NBA has a giant mess on its hands with no easy solution in sight and is now getting formal suggestions from the American government on how to solve it.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mRA5YbXAG7epMESTy0Ju6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kIhmpmcmlm44B6FUghLJAQ--~B/aD0yNjcxO3c9NDAwNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/78bf1a10-eb03-11e9-9b6d-17e0e886de07", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
