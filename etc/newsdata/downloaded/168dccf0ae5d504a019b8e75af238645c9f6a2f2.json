A legend and an inspiration.\u2019\n\nArnie is back on screens for Terminator (Picture: Paramount Pictures)\n\nLikewise Jackie was feeling the love as he shared the same image to social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So happy to run into my good old friend and legend @schwarzenegger,\u2019 he penned, as fans loved the snapshot.\n\n\u2018Just a couple of game changers,\u2019 one fan mused, as another added: \u2018Legends of LIFE.\u2019\n\nTrue fact.\n\nThe pair looked worlds away from their action hero selves, as they dressed casually for the get together; Arnold in a blue t-shirt and Jackie in a grey hoodie.\n\nArnold has returned to his Terminator roots for the latest film, Dark Fate, which sees him play iconic robot T-800. Speaking to Metro.co.uk recently, Arnie made it sound like a walk in the park when he revealed his training regime.\n\n\u2018I train every day. I ride bikes every day, I ski, I still do a lot of sports, so for me it\u2019s a little more normal that I\u2019ll come in and do my action movies that I\u2019m ready and in shape,\u2019 the action stalwart said.\n\n\u2018When someone comes in who hasn\u2019t done it for a while, like Linda, it\u2019s more unusual,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018I always love it. In this movie the director was very demanding and he demanded a lot of action and a lot of work and we worked for hours and hours \u2013 yes even I got sore myself from all the reps.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is in cinemas now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
