One request of Kipchoge since Nike Breaking2 was to involve fans, meaning the route will be lined by spectators in order to provide him with support.\n\nWill it be a world record?\n\nNo, there are no other entrants for the challenge (though Jonathan Korir, Augustine Choge and Gideon Kipketer will act as pacemakers), meaning Kipchoge\u2019s attempt will contravene IAAF rules, as there will be 41 athletes providing him with the requisite pace, rotating in and out, as well as protecting him from the wind.\n\nA world record attempt could be valid if the pacers did not rejoin the race, but this is not the case here.\n\nWhen is the attempt?\n\nThe challenge will take place on Saturday 12 October.\n\nThe final start time is 08:15 CEST (07:15 BST).\n\nKipchoge prefers the weather to be between seven and 14 C, with humidity beneath 80 per cent, meaning it should start in the early hours of the morning.\n\nThe numbers\n\nHere are the numbers Kipchoge must hit in order to break 2:00:00. Kipchoge will need to sustain a 4:34 minutes per mile pace over the distance to complete the challenge.\n\n100m: 17.08s\n\n200m: 34.17s\n\n400m: 1 minute, 8 seconds\n\n800m: 2 minutes, 16 seconds\n\n1,500m: 4 minutes, 16 seconds\n\n5,000m: 14 minutes, 13 seconds\n\n10,000m: 28 minutes, 26 seconds\n\nHalf-marathon: 59 minutes, 59 seconds\n\nWhat Kipchoge\u2019s saying\n\n\u201cI want to unlock that thought that there are limitations in the human being,\u201d Kipchoge told The Associated Press upon the challenge\u2019s launch.\n\n\u201cThere are no barriers when you believe in yourself and try and trust in what you are doing.\u201d", "description": "Eliud Kipchoge\u00a0tackles Ineos's 159 Challenge on Saturday in his second bid to break the two-hour barrier in the marathon.
