With new entrants coming into the fray every few months, it\u2019s getting harder to keep track of all of the battery-powered electric vehicles offered today.\n\nBecause range is a huge consideration for any electric vehicle, we\u2019ve rounded up the 10 EVs that you can buy new today that offer the most range between charges. As of this writing, each vehicle on this list is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit plus whatever your state and local governments offer, which can make a significant dent in the purchase price.\n\nFor this list, we\u2019re leaning on Environmental Protection Agency range ratings from fueleconomy.gov. While there are some much-hyped new EVs on the horizon \u2014 such as the Porsche Taycan, the Mercedes-Benz EQC and the Rivian R1T and R1S \u2014 that will likely place on this list in the future, they haven\u2019t been rated by the EPA yet.\n\n2020 Tesla Model S: 370 miles\n\nWhile many electric vehicles have entered the fray since it first arrived in 2012, the Tesla Model S is still the range king. Tesla TSLA, +0.72% produces two versions of the Model S \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly, the Long Range model offers the longest range, with 370 miles of possible range between charges. The Performance model, which offers an insane 0-to-60 mph time of 2.4 seconds, tops out at about 345 miles. All-new Model S vehicles come with all-wheel drive and an adaptive air suspension. Another of the vehicle\u2019s most noteworthy features is its huge 17-in center screen, which acts as the vehicle\u2019s command center and offers full web-browsing capabilities. (We absolutely do not recommend using this feature while driving.) A Model S Long Range starts around $80,000, while the Performance trim starts around $100,000.\n\n2020 Tesla Model X \u2014 325 miles\n\nBasically an SUV version of the Model S, the bigger, heavier Model X doesn\u2019t range quite as far as its sedan-bodied sibling. In the Long Range guise, the Model X can go about 325 between charges, and its 0-to-60 mph time is about 4.4 seconds. The Performance model\u2019s range is about 305 miles, and it goes from 0-to-60 mph in about 2.7 seconds. Just like the Performance trim of the Model S, the Model X comes with Tesla\u2019s Ludicrous Mode acceleration boost and sporty exterior styling elements. All Model X vehicles come with AWD drive and Tesla\u2019s novel Falcon Wing doors, and they seat as many as seven people. Pricing starts at $85,000 for a Long Range model and $105,000 for a Performance trim \u2014 and climbs quickly once you start adding options.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why it\u2019s only a matter of time before oil runs out of gas and electric vehicles power ahead\n\n2020 Tesla Model 3 \u2014 310 miles\n\nTesla\u2019s newest offering, the compact Model 3, is designed to be a more affordable alternative to the luxe-oriented Model S and Model X, but it still offers impressive performance and great range. Three trims are currently listed for sale on Tesla\u2019s website. The Performance and Long Range trims can go up to 310 miles on a single charge, and each comes in AWD. The Performance trim has some giddy-up, too, clocking a 0-to-60 mph time of 3.2 seconds, and it features performance brakes and a track mode, too. There\u2019s also a basic, rear-wheel-drive Standard Range Plus model, which can go 240 miles before recharging. The Standard Range Plus trim is still pretty quick, with a 5.3-second 0-to-60 mph time. Pricing for the so-called people\u2019s Tesla starts at $39,000 for the Standard Range Plus trim. The Long Range Model 3 starts at $48,000, and the top-of-the-line Performance model starts at $56,000.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Bolt \u2014 259 miles\n\nChevrolet The Chevy Bolt.\n\nLike similar EV offerings from Hyundai HYMTF, +8.73% and Kia, the Bolt is a small, unassuming hatchback packing an impressive EV powertrain. In addition to offering up to 238 miles of range, the Bolt comes with a roomy interior and a great infotainment system packing both Android Auto and Apple AAPL, -0.40% CarPlaycompatibility. It\u2019s also available in all 50 states, which can\u2019t be said for Hyundai\u2019s and Kia\u2019s EVs. Additionally, something prospective EV buyers might forget is that to reap the full benefits of their vehicle\u2019s fast-charging capabilities, a special charging station needs to be installed in their home. In the case of the Bolt, the cost of this charging infrastructure \u2014 typically around $750 \u2014 can be lumped into the financing of the vehicle. The Bolt\u2019s MSRP comes in at between about $38,000 and $45,000, but GM GM, +1.08% incentives help to reduce this figure significantly, even before factoring in federal tax credits. Suffice it to say, the Bolt is a pretty good deal.\n\n2020 Hyundai Kona Electric \u2014 258 miles\n\nThis humble compact crossover from Hyundai is the leading non-Tesla EV when it comes to range, traveling about 258 miles between charges. The Kona Electric also comes in at a reasonable price: about $38,000 for the SEL trim, or $46,000 for the loaded Ultimate trim. Given that the gas-powered Kona offers good ergonomics, great space and a refined interior, we find the Kona Electric to be one of the most enjoyable battery-powered vehicles on sale today. The Kona Electric\u2019s plug is cleverly hidden in its grille. Its battery carries a lifetime warranty, and it offers the equivalent of 201 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, which comes on instantly, allowing for a relatively quick 0-to-60 mph time of 6.4 seconds.\n\nRead next: 7 tips for buying your first electric vehicle\n\n2020 Kia Soul EV \u2014 243 miles\n\nKia Kia Soul EV\n\nThe Kia Soul has been fully redesigned for 2020, doubling down on its sleek, futuristic storm trooper look. Offering great practicality thanks to its boxy shape, the value-packed Soul is already one of our favorite small cars on sale today. Factor in the EV\u2019s electric powertrain and its generous 243 miles of range, and the Soul becomes even more compelling. Previous iterations of the Soul EV could only go about 111 miles, so the new-for-2020 model is a considerable improvement. The Soul EV should be available at select Kia dealerships starting in 2020. Pricing has yet to be released.\n\n2019 Kia Niro EV \u2014 239 miles\n\nKia The Kia Niro.\n\nWhile the Niro comes standard with a hybrid powertrain, Kia introduced a fully electric version in 2019. Building upon what was already regarded as a highly competent and fuel-efficient compact crossover, the Niro EV offers an impressive 239 miles of range. One of the more understated EVs on our list, the Niro EV is only subtly different, stylistically, than its gas-powered brother, with a unique grille (under which is a door for the plug), unique wheels, and light blue exterior accents. Two trims are offered: Pricing for the EX starts at just under $40,000, while the EX Premium starts at about $45,000.\n\n2020 Jaguar I-PACE \u2014 234 miles\n\nJaguar The Jaguar I-Pace\n\nDon\u2019t be confused by Jaguar\u2019s model names \u2014 while the company offers a compact crossover called the E-Pace, its electric offering is the I-Pace. Despite the misleading nomenclature, the I-Pace is one of the most highly regarded new EVs to hit the market in recent years. It\u2019s fun to drive and offers a spacious interior that remains true to Jaguar\u2019s luxury-car roots. (Unlike Tesla, whose minimalist, screen-centric design can take some getting used to.) Additionally, the I-Pace\u2019s dual electric motors \u2014 there\u2019s one at each axle \u2014 provide standard AWD and are rated at the equivalent of 394 hp and a whopping 510 lb-ft of torque, good for going from 0-to-60 mph in about four seconds. Thanks to its height-adjustable suspension and surprisingly competent traction control systems, the I-Pace can also handle some light off-roading, unlike most EVs. The I-Pace starts just north of $70,000 and reaches about $90,000 when fully loaded.\n\nAlso read: The best thing you can do for the environment will also save you $234,000\n\n2019 Nissan Leaf \u2014 226 miles\n\nThe Nissan NSANY, +0.08% Leaf was one of the first mainstream EVs when it made its debut back in 2011. It\u2019s now in its second generation, and with this new generation comes an extended-range model capable of traveling up to 239 miles on a single charge. Pricing for the Leaf Plus starts at about $38,000 for a basic S Plus trim and tops out just shy of $44,000 for the loaded SL Plus trim, which includes a 360-degree surround-view monitor, leather seats and a Bose audio system. The SL Plus trim also comes with Nissan\u2019s clever ProPilot Assist feature, which helps guide the vehicle on the highway. We love the Leaf Plus\u2019s spacious hatchback design, user-friendly interior and standard DC Fast Charge system, which can greatly reduce charging times.\n\n2020 Audi e-tron \u2014 204 miles\n\nAudi The Audi e-tron.\n\nAudi\u2019s first electric-only crossover, the e-tron, was expected to offer around 225 miles of range when it made its debut in 2019. It didn\u2019t \u2014 it showed up with a range of only about 204 miles. Still, it\u2019s a luxurious and spacious battery-powered crossover that undercuts Tesla on price while. It has a better, more established dealer network, too, and it\u2019s soon to have its own fast-charging capabilities via Electrify America. The e-tron boasts Audi build quality \u2014 which is better than Tesla\u2019s \u2014 and an upscale cabin that should be charmingly familiar to most luxury buyers. The 2020 e-tron starts at about $76,000 and tops out at about $88,000 in the fully loaded Prestige guise.", "description": "Tamp down your range anxiety with any of these electric vehicles\u2014all eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit.", "authors": ["Chris O'Neill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS914_at_evs_MG_20191008194220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
