If Brussels do not agree, Britain won\u2019t negotiate further and leave on the 3st October. One unnamed EU member expects it to \u201cgo down like a bucket of sik\u201d. No pressure then\u2026\n\nNZD and AUD are the strongest majors, after a weaker USD provided the heavily oversold currencies a reprieve. The dollar was given a setback in the US session with manufacturing PMI data crashing to a 10-year low.\n\nJapan claim that a North Korean missile has landed in their exclusive economic zone. South Korea suggest it was launched from a submarine.\n\nAll majors and crosses remain within their typical daily ranges, ahead of what appears to be a quiet day for economic data from Europe and US. DXY and tread water near yesterday\u2019s lows, nudged its way to 12-bar low.\n\nAsian Cash Indices % Change\n\nEquity Brief:\n\nA sea of red today for Asian stock markets that have erased all the gains seen in the past 2 days. Tracking the losses seen overnight in the U.S. stock market that has been triggered by a dismal ISM manufacturing data for Sep that contracted for a 2nd consecutive month to 47.8, the lowest level since Jun 2009.\n\nThe Australia\u2019s is one of the worst performers as it tumbled by -1.46% so far that has offset the \u201coptimism\u201d created by RBA\u2019s dovish monetary policy stance. Also, the on-going weakness seen in Australian stocks have been reinforced by a misconduct charge at National Australia Bank, one of Australia\u2019s largest banks. The bank will be slap with a A$1.2 billion charge to compensate customers given poor financial advice or sold junk insurance. The share price of National Australia Bank has declined by -2.49%.\n\nThe E-Mini futures has managed to stage a modest bounce of 0.19% in today\u2019s Asian session to print a current intraday high of 2949 after a decline of -1.23% seen in yesterday\u2019s U.S. session at it staged a test on the key support at 2940.\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nUp Next\n\nUK manufacturing is the next PMI to step into the limelight, although expectations are low given the sector has contracted for the best part of 5-months.\n\nU.S ADP (NASDAQ: ) Employment Change for Sep (a prelude this Fri\u2019s Non-Farm Payrolls) where market participants are expecting an increase of 140K over 195K recorded in Aug. A better than expected print suggests that the U.S. job market is still resilient against a backdrop of deteriorating economic conditions seen in the rest of the world which may offset some of the losses seen in stocks. That said, markets may be more twitchy to a weak print had they otherwise been, following yesterday\u2019s dismal ISM print from US yesterday.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s not a set of first-tier data, so traders will probably react more towards Brexit and / or impeachment updates.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
