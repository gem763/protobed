This week, we\u2019re publishing new stories every day about the creators, their tools, and the platforms where they publish their work.\n\nMore than ever, the web is centered on platforms that thrive off of content submitted by individual creators. Whether they\u2019re making short films, absurdist memes, thoughtful podcasts, brilliant photos, quirky games, sharp blog posts, or just another daily vlog, it\u2019s their creations that shape our experience on the web. They\u2019re what keep us coming back, and they\u2019re what lead the platforms to change \u2014 sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.\n\nThe exciting, complex world of creators as they invent new ways of using their platforms and tools\n\nFor our Creators Issue, we\u2019re talking to some of the artists whose work we spend all day flipping through: the designers, filmmakers, influencers, illustrators, musicians, and more. These are stories about what they\u2019re making, how they\u2019re finding an audience, and the many ups and downs of reaching fans through a platform that\u2019s out of their control. You can also explore the archives of our ongoing creator series What\u2019s in Your Bag? and Art Club.\n\nOf course, the same factors that let our favorites succeed also let troubling content grow in scale. As that happens, platforms have to change, and their choices can have enormous consequences, from amplifying extremist ideologies to disrupting the community of creators and viewers who originally made a platform thrive. This issue also takes a look at how those changes ripple through a community, and some of the problematic content that\u2019s still able to get by.", "description": "YouTubers, Instagrammers, SoundCloud artists, Kickstarter startups \u2014 we now live in a world where passion and the ability to connect with an audience are all it takes to build a business. The Verge\u2019s Creators Issue will illuminate the world of a new generation of entrepreneurs who are changing pop culture.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Cat Ferguson", "Dani Deahl", "Andrew Marino", "Ashley Carman", "Dami Lee", "Lux Alptraum", "Makena Kelly", "Megan Farokhmanesh", "Andrew Webster"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pAqziswxpmHv4bHZ0cMSIEkWco=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15995697/acastro_190328_3326_creators_week_cover_white.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-01"}
