Our policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just mad we look good doing it.\u201d\n\nMany other people came to her defence on social media, pointing out that the congresswoman paid the typical price for a visit to the hair salon - and that men are often unaware how much it costs for women.\n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s pretty standard for a trip to a salon unfortunately,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
