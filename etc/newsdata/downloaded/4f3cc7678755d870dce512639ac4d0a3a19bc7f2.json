(Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nJoe Biden hit back Saturday after being swept up in President Trump\u2019s latest national controversy, providing an early look at how he\u2019ll respond to Trump\u2019s attacks.\n\nThis week, The Washington Post reported that Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate a company with ties to Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Trump\u2019s request seemed designed to elicit damaging information about a political rival ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nBiden, the top-polling 2020 Democratic presidential candidate who beats Trump in head-to-head matchups in battleground states and nationwide, said Saturday that if the president did that, it\u2019s only because \u201che knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nBiden also challenged Trump to release a transcript of his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.\n\nBiden found himself at the center of a massive political scandal that includes unfounded accusations spread by Trump and his allies that Biden used his influence as vice president to help his son with a business deal.\n\nTrump and his allies reportedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden\u2019s efforts in 2016 to convince Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at the time was also investigating a natural gas company that employed Hunter.\n\nBiden said he knew nothing of his son\u2019s business deal and was acting on behalf of the United States, which saw the prosecutor as ineffective at stamping out corruption.\n\n[Scrutiny over Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal may also complicate Biden\u2019s campaign]\n\nThe Biden campaign sent a lengthy memo to reporters Saturday listing quotes from various news outlets, including the Kyiv Post in Ukraine, discrediting Trump\u2019s attack.\n\nThe memo seems part of a larger Biden campaign effort to get ahead of the story and keep history from repeating itself \u2014 if Trump keeps peddling the story, it could dog his campaign just as Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails dogged hers.\n\nBiden, campaigning at the Polk County, Iowa, Steak Fry, wouldn\u2019t say whether Trump deserves to be impeached over his alleged conversations with Zelensky, but said the House should investigate.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power, to get on the phone with a foreign power who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me, if that\u2019s what happened, that\u2019s what appears to have happened,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cTrump\u2019s doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum and is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try and smear.\u201d\n\nOther Democratic presidential hopefuls also referenced the story in their Iowa remarks. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) referenced Trump\u2019s alleged conversation with the Ukrainian president when she spoke to voters Saturday. \u201cJust in the last 48 hours, yet again, we find that he is in cahoots with a foreign government to manipulate the outcome of this election for president of the United States,\u201d Harris said.\n\nTrump has neither confirmed or denied that he spoke to Zelensky about Biden, saying only that his conversations with the foreign leader were appropriate and calling these latest allegations another witch hunt.\n\n[Trump defends call with Ukrainian president, calling it \u2018perfectly fine and routine\u2019]\n\nNews of the call came to light after an intelligence official whistleblower shared with the intelligence agency\u2019s inspector general that the official had heard the president make a promise to a foreign leader that wasn\u2019t appropriate. Subsequent reporting has found that the call was with Ukraine and related to Trump\u2019s desire to get dirt on his possible political opponent.\n\nHowever, no one has seen the actual complaint filed by the whistleblower because Congress hasn\u2019t been provided a copy.\n\nHolly Bailey in Iowa contributed to this report.", "description": "The former vice president says a transcript of the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president ought to be released.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7f2j2xwg9c31YUW7pazerrbahnM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QMO5YW4S4I6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
