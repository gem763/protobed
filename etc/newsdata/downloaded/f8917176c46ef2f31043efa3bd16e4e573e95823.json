All four have had their fair share of struggles with depression and mental illness, so the talk covered everything from what it\u2019s like to spend time in a psych ward (Bamford and Gulman have firsthand knowledge), worrying that going on meds will make you a less funny comedian, dealing with hecklers (Bamford says she\u2019s attempted to respond to them using a \u201cmindfulness meditation\u201d approach), how spending too much time on social media makes everything worse, and the worst therapists they\u2019ve ever had.\n\nOn social media, Apatow shared one solution that\u2019s worked for him whenever he comes across a mean tweet about him. \u201cYou know what I do in that moment? I go through that person\u2019s tweets, and I will go back years and years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there will be something pleasant on it, right? So they\u2019re like \u2018Judd Apatow is shit,\u2019 and then I will find something from three years ago, like a picture of them with their new puppy. And I\u2019ll just retweet it. I am watching you. I know everything.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the conversation, Gulman made the perfect joke about living life in a body that never matches his emotions. \u201cI\u2019m built like the Jewish Gaston, but inside \u2026\u201d he said. \u201cI took the Disney prince test, and I\u2019m a Belle: I love to read, and mental illness runs in my family.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Gulman\u2019s Great Depresh set, Oswalt said, \u201cYou said something that really made me sit up during your set, where you talked about \u2018I spend all day getting way too emotionally angry about the pettiest shit.\u2019 But then that, at night, is what pays my bills.\u201d Apatow summed it up in another way. \u201cWhen you do stand-up or certain types of writing, what I like about it is the worst thing that ever happens, you\u2019re so happy that it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your whole life you\u2019re running through that filter, in a weird way you\u2019re excited for all the bad stuff.\u201d Watch the full chat above.", "description": "At Largo in Los Angeles, Judd Apatow led a conversation about comedy and mental health with stand-up comedians Gary Gulman, Maria Bamford, and Patton Oswalt.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-bamford-oswalt-gulman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
