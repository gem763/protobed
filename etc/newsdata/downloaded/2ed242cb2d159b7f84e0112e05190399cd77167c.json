Appearing on the stage at a Grand Rapids debate called \u201cSchool Vouchers \u2014 Yes or No?,\u201d Booker represented \u201cYes.\u201d He passionately echoed the DeVos view that parents should be able to use tax dollars to pay for a child\u2019s private school education, according to a video of the event obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nThe debate was the prelude to an unlikely alliance with Betsy DeVos. Booker served with her on the boards of pro-voucher groups, attended numerous meetings with her across the country, and supported key parts of her agenda. Like a number of elected officials representing cities with poor education records, Booker sought alternatives to a failing system. He decided to back vouchers and charter schools.\n\nBooker\u2019s political career took off as a parade of wealthy philanthropists, hedge fund managers and others who supported DeVos\u2019s \u201cschool choice\u201d viewpoint poured money into his campaigns and pet projects.\n\nBut as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. Vouchers and charters schools are anathema to many powerful teachers unions, who have outsize power in Democratic primaries, and some candidates in the party strongly oppose them on the grounds that they weaken traditional public schools.\n\nDeVos is also reviled by many on the left, as Democrats have said she is unqualified for her job and have questioned her commitment to public schools.\n\nIn response, Booker has defended his record but also performed a series of reversals and denials. In the most striking instance, Booker said in a recent interview with The Post at his campaign headquarters here that he doesn\u2019t recall his participation in the Michigan debate. \u201cI remember visiting Grand Rapids. But I don\u2019t remember a debate,\u201d Booker said.\n\nBooker now takes a view opposite of his debate stance. He told The Post in a recent candidate survey that \u201cthe evidence has become clear that vouchers do not help \u2014 and in fact, hurt \u2014 the cause of educational equity.\u201d In his interview with The Post, Booker said that while he did initially support vouchers when he was on the City Council, he turned against them by the time he became mayor in 2006.\n\nHe also has separated himself from DeVos. In a dramatic 2017 Senate floor speech, Booker opposed DeVos\u2019s nomination to be Secretary of Education, saying he had \u201cno confidence\u201d in her stance on civil rights issues, without mentioning their prior work together on pro-voucher groups.\n\nDeVos\u2019s allies are stunned by what they call his turnabout. They view Booker\u2019s effort to distance himself from her and her agenda as a betrayal.\n\n\u201cNow that it is politically inconvenient, he has distanced himself from the issue and those who helped launch his political career,\u201d said William E. Oberndorf, who was chairman of the American Education Reform Council when DeVos and Booker were on the board. \u201cCory once told me that his father used to say to him, \u2018Never forget the girl who brought you to the dance.\u2019 I can only conclude that Cory not only forgot one of the girls who brought him to the dance, he missed his . . . moment to stand up for an issue he always said he believed in.\u201d\n\nBetsy and Dick DeVos declined to comment.\n\nBooker said Newark\u2019s public schools were in crisis when he became a City Council member and then mayor. With the state having seized control of the city\u2019s failed school system, he said he was \u201cdesperate\u201d for anything and anyone who could help the city\u2019s children.\n\n\u201cI was looking to anybody who had ideas that could help rescue my children from patently unjust educational circumstances,\u201d Booker said. Initially vouchers, and the backing of DeVos\u2019s network of financial contributors, seemed to provide just the opening he wanted.\n\nBreaking with Democrats\n\nBooker\u2019s support of programs such as vouchers was rooted in his upbringing. Booker\u2019s parents had grown up in the South, where they experienced widespread racism, became employees of IBM, and moved to New Jersey.\n\nBooker said his parents sought to live in what he said was the \u201call-white suburb\u201d of Harrington Park, 22 miles north of Newark, to put their children in good schools. They were able to buy the house only after intervention by a civil rights group, Booker said. As a result, Booker said he obtained a stellar education \u2014 one that he said is denied to countless children in poor areas \u2014 that eventually enabled him to attend Stanford University and Yale Law School, and become a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nBooker was elected to the Newark City Council in 1998 and, after witnessing the frustration of parents of inner-city children in poorly financed school districts, he became one of the best-known early supporters of vouchers among Democrats. He was embraced by conservative Republicans who were waging campaigns across the country to enact voucher programs.\n\nIn September 2000, Booker delivered a blistering pro-voucher speech to the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group.\n\nAt the time, the graduation rate in Newark was 45 percent, and 75 percent of eighth-graders failed math proficiency tests, which Booker said in the speech was a \u201crepugnant\u201d situation.\n\nWealthy people, Booker told the Institute audience, \u201chave vouchers because they have the power to choose schools for their children.\u201d It was unfair, he said, that the country\u2019s leaders in effect \u201csay to the poorest, most vulnerable Americans that they cannot choose.\u201d\n\nBooker later told Dale Russakof, author of \u201cThe Prize,\u201d a book about the effort to transform Newark\u2019s schools, that \u201cI became a pariah in Democratic circles for taking on the party orthodoxy on education,\u201d but it led to him gaining \u201call these Republican donors and donors from outside Newark, many of them motivated because we have an African American urban Democrat telling the truth about education.\u201d\n\nAmong the Republicans most excited about Booker were members of the DeVos family, who had made billions of dollars running the Amway Corporation.\n\nIn Michigan, Dick DeVos was leading a group called Kids First! Yes!, which was behind a ballot initiative that would enable taxpayer dollars to be used for vouchers to pay for private religious education. Betsy DeVos had supported the measure in her role as chairwoman of the Republican State Committee.\n\nA debate on the issue was slated to be co-sponsored by the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty. Betsy DeVos served on the Acton board at the time and the DeVos family was a financial supporter of the institute, Acton officials said.\n\nBooker\u2019s opponent in the debate was Wendy Wagenheim, the legislative director of the Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Wagenheim kept a video of the debate and provided a copy to The Post. It provides an unparalleled view into Booker\u2019s thinking on the issue at the time, one that has not been seen publicly in 19 years.\n\nWagenheim began the debate by noting that Booker didn\u2019t live or vote in Michigan, while she and her fellow residents would have to bear the consequences of a vote for vouchers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not flying out back to New Jersey or wherever he is going tomorrow,\u201d she said.\n\nBooker struck back. \u201cWhen I fly out, I go to the projects,\u201d Booker said, referring to a recreational vehicle that he lived in near an urban housing area in Newark. \u201cWhen she leaves here, she goes to the suburbs.\u201d\n\nBooker argued that vouchers should be provided if it meant a child could get a better education. \u201cIf a better school is across the street, and it\u2019s a Catholic school, they should be able to go there\u201d with taxpayer-financed vouchers, Booker said.\n\nIn November, voters sided with Wagenheim, defeating the efforts to legalize vouchers by a 3-to-1 margin. But Booker didn\u2019t waver.\n\nChampion of choice\n\nBooker lost his 2002 campaign for mayor, but school-choice backers flocked to him.\n\nOberndorf, an investor and philanthropist who remains close to DeVos, helped lead the way. He held at least three fundraisers for Booker in his San Francisco home, each attended by about 50 people, some of them familiar to Booker from his days at Stanford University.\n\nAs chairman of the American Education Reform Council, a pro-voucher group that included DeVos on its board, Oberndorf became convinced of Booker\u2019s commitment to the issue and invited Booker to join the board in 2003. Booker accepted. Then, from 2004 until 2009, DeVos and Booker were on the boards of two related organizations that met simultaneously, according to former board members.\n\nOberndorf said he watched Booker work closely with DeVos at board meetings. \u201cThe purpose of the organization at that time was solely focused on private school choice,\u201d Oberndorf said in an email. \u201cThe board met three times a year, and virtually all of those meetings were held in person where Cory and Betsy DeVos were both present. At no time do I ever remember them having anything but warm and high regard for one another. There also was virtually no disagreement or misunderstanding between them or anyone else at those meetings as to the mission of the organization.\u201d\n\nThe council\u2019s president, Susan Mitchell, recalled it similarly, saying via email that \u201cduring all the years I worked with Cory and Betsy, I never observed anything other than a warm relationship between them. I recall no occasion when Cory was critical of Betsy. Betsy was extremely supportive of Cory.\u201d\n\nBooker, however, said he aired his disagreements with DeVos, Oberndorf and others during the board meetings. \u201cWe fought like the dickens over a lot of issues,\u201d he said, recalling \u201cheated arguments.\u201d\n\nTold that Oberndorf and Mitchell recalled no such arguments, Booker suggested talking to another former board member, Howard Fuller. In a telephone interview, Fuller, a professor of education at Marquette University, disputed Booker\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cI was on the board the whole time,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cThere were no heated arguments about anything. I consider Cory to be a friend, I respect Cory, I believe that people can change their minds, but you can\u2019t revise history.\u201d Fuller said DeVos and Booker \u201cwere friends. Obviously Cory has changed.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s connections to school-choice advocates across the country, as well as many others, helped him raise millions of dollars for his 2006 campaign for Newark mayor, which he won after promising to revolutionize the city\u2019s schools.\n\nAs mayor, he had abandoned his support for vouchers, although he supported a proposal for tuition tax credits for low-income families. He emphasized charter schools as a way of giving students in failing schools other options, and he remained on the board of DeVos-connected groups through the first several years of being mayor.\n\nAt the time, a growing number of Democrats, including President Barack Obama, expressed support for charter schools. The majority of charter schools \u2014 and all of those in Newark \u2014 are nonprofit groups funded with tax dollars. Most are not unionized. Some union officials have opposed the growth of charters on grounds that they diverted money from traditional schools and would draw away the best students, although Booker said that did not happen in Newark.\n\nBooker recently has criticized some charter school programs as \u201creally offensive\u201d and \u201cRepublican schemes\u201d even as he defended those he helped enact in Newark.\n\nBooker\u2019s support for charters gained even more attention when Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg appeared in 2010 with him on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d to announce a $100 million gift to help improve Newark\u2019s schools. Booker agreed to raise another $100 million, much of it from Wall Streeters who backed school choice and his campaigns.\n\nThe money led to a groundbreaking compromise: It helped seal a contract with the union that raised teacher salaries and provided money for charter schools.\n\nShortly afterward, Booker delivered the 2012 keynote speech at the American Federation for Children, which DeVos attended in her role as chairwoman. Booker\u2019s appearance drew derision from many Democrats.\n\nBooker defended his appearance, saying the group had members of both major political parties, but then he took a swipe at then-President Obama. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out there fighting for my president, but he does not send his kids to Washington, D.C., public schools,\u201d Booker said. Obama\u2019s two daughters attended the private Sidwell Friends School in Northwest Washington.\n\nBooker told the group, \u201cWe created a system that if you\u2019re connected, elected, have wealth and privilege, you get freedom in this country, and now you want to deny that to my community.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of progress, the state returned control of the school system to Newark two years ago. The number of Newark students in charters has risen from 10 percent when Booker was elected mayor to more than 35 percent today, compared to 6 percent nationwide.\n\nBooker cited positive findings in a study completed earlier this year by the New Jersey Children\u2019s Foundation. It found that black students in Newark were four times as likely to attend a school above the state average as in 2006, when Booker was elected mayor. The study also, however, said 15,000 students, nearly one-third of the total, attend schools with low proficiency rates.\n\nDeVos supporters stunned\n\nBooker\u2019s emphasis on education resonated with New Jersey voters, and he was elected U.S. senator in 2013 in a special election. He received help from Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who contributed to his campaign and hosted a fundraiser at their home, and he was reelected in 2014.\n\nBooker, 50, said in the interview that he had already broken sharply with DeVos by this time.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a guy in my 20s, I . . . was willing to go anywhere I could, talk to anyone, if it was gonna help inner-city black and brown people get an education. Now as I got older and into my 30s and started looking at these ideal programs that people created, like Betsy DeVos, and saw how bad they were, and also saw that some of the agenda that I felt they held was very dangerous on lots of levels \u2014 including one that I\u2019m very concerned with about race equity in this country \u2014 I fell out and said, \u2018This is not the strategy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut as recently as May 2016, Booker appeared again before the group that DeVos chaired, the American Federation for Children. After DeVos delivered a speech defending herself against attacks from Democrats, Oberndorf warmly introduced Booker, praising his commitment to school choice.\n\nBooker spoke proudly about the growing number of students in Newark\u2019s charter schools, saying, \u201cThis mission of this organization is the mission of our nation. . . . I have been involved with this organization for 10 years and I have seen the sacred honor of those here.\u201d\n\nAs Booker finished his speech, the audience gave him a standing ovation. To DeVos and her allies, it seemed that Booker was still firmly in the fold, according to Oberndorf.\n\nSeven months later, President-elect Trump announced that he was nominating DeVos as education secretary. DeVos\u2019s backers were concerned she could lose the nomination by a single vote, so Booker\u2019s support seemed crucial.\n\nBut when Booker appeared on the Senate floor on Feb. 6, 2017, he made no mention during his 46-minute speech that he had been allied with her. He said he opposed her because of his concern that she would not have an effective Office for Civil Rights.\n\nHe said did not have confidence DeVos would protect those who are harassed in school because of their skin color or sexual orientation. A Booker campaign aide said the senator was also concerned about reports that DeVos and her family had donated to \u201canti-LGBT\u201d groups.\n\nThe \u201creason I fought so hard against her was probably because I knew her really well,\u201d Booker said in the interview, \u201cand there were things about her on LGBTQ issues or things about her on race issues that really bothered me.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s vote shattered his career-long alliance with DeVos and stunned her supporters.\n\n\u201cCory gained a great deal of political support thanks to his association with Betsy and other supporters,\u201d said Mitchell, the president of the American Education Reform Council when Booker and DeVos were board members. \u201cHis abandonment of school choice and of Betsy makes it clear that his professed commitment to the issue and his friendship with her were fueled by political ambition, not principle.\u201d\n\nEvery Democrat and two Republicans opposed DeVos\u2019s nomination. She was approved by the narrowest margin, a 50-50 tie broken by Vice President Pence, the first time in history that such a step was needed for a Cabinet position.\n\nAlice Crites and Laura Meckler contributed to this report.", "description": "Booker appeared as a pro-voucher representative in a debate he says he can\u2019t remember.", "authors": ["Michael Kranish", "National Political Investigative Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GBO2UFWWO4I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
