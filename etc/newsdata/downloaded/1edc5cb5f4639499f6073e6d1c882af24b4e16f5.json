The Iranian regime is not interested in peace \u2013 they\u2019re pursuing nuclear weapons and regional dominance.\n\n\u201cIt is now time for the US to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment.\u201d\n\nUS secretary of state Mike Pompeo also blamed Iran for the attacks on the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility in Buqyaq and an oilfield in Khurais, which cut Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude oil supply by around 50 per cent.\n\nMr Pompeo insisted there was \u201cno evidence the attacks came from Yemen\u201d, even though Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the strikes.\n\n\u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d he said, adding that the US would ensure that \u201cIran is held accountable for its aggression.\u201d\n\nThe growing clamour for a confrontation with Iran comes just five days after the president sacked his national security adviser John Bolton, who was an outspoken advocate of regime change. It had even been suggested that Mr Trump was interested in renegotiating a new deal with the middle eastern country.\n\nRead more\n\nDrone attacks spark huge fire at world\u2019s biggest oil processing site\n\nIran rejected Mr Pompeo\u2019s statement as \u201cmaxium lies\u201d and asserted that it \u201chas always been ready for a \u2018full-fledged war\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cEverybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometres around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\u201d the head of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps Aerospace Force Amirali Hajizadeh said on Sunday.\n\nSaudi Arabia claims Iran is arming the Houthi rebel group and has blamed its regional rival for previous attacks. It intervened in the Yemen civil war against the Houthis in 2015 and the conflict is now regarded as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nHowever, critics of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to blame Iran described it as an \u201cirresponsible simplification\u201d, with some speculating that the recent departure of John Bolton as national security adviser has increased the risk of armed conflict with the country.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how we get into dumb wars,\u201d said Democratic senator and committee member Chris Murphy. \u201cIran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it\u2019s just not as simple as Houthis equals Iran.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Drone attacks spark huge fire at world\u2019s biggest oil processing site", "description": "A key ally of Donald Trump has urged the US to consider attacking Iran in response to the drone attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry.Republican senator Lindsay Graham, a prominent foreign policy hawk, suggested that hitting the country\u2019s own refineries would \u201cbreak the regime\u2019s back\u201d.", "authors": ["Peter Stubley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9ky3D45Ad0oNBZzErvNuZA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/cc0db7385d8c55165301fda5161fd8d3", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
