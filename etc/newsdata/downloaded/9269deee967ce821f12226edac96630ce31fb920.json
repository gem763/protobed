Doctors told her that this time she had a polycystic liver.\n\n\u2018My liver became enlarged and body quickly became full of fluid. I was lucky to hold on long enough for a liver transplant in December 2013, and I received a new liver from an amazing donor family \u2013 I have called my new liver Lionel.\n\n\u2018During both periods of illness I was not living \u2013 I was just existing.\n\n\u2018Everyday tasks were too much for me to complete and I was sleeping upright on the sofa as if I lay down I could not breathe. I did manage to continue to work part time, but it was a struggle.\u2019\n\nSport and fitness has always been really important to Helen, so getting back to being active was high on her priorities after she recovered from her transplants.\n\n\u2018Before becoming unwell I used to be really active, I even owned horses and rode regularly so discovering I was ill came as a real shock,\u2019 explains Helen.\n\n\u2018To be able to do any sport is, I have found, a luxury, and there are a lot of people who are not able to do this even if they wanted to.\n\n\u2018Since my second transplant I have had a go at archery, 100m, 200m, long jump, discus, shot putt and javelin \u2013 having done none of these before I was ill.\n\n\u2018Being able to run, jump and throw has really helped to motivate me as I appreciate being able to do things like this when for a long period of time, even walking was difficult.\u2019\n\n\u2018I appreciate being able to do things like this when for a long period of time, even walking was difficult\u2019 (Picture: Helen Wilson)\n\nThis is why Helen was so keen to get involved with the British Transplant Games. She found out about the competition when staff at King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust encouraged her to attend in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I went along as a spectator to the opening ceremony and became very emotional when I saw the donor families and listened to them talking about how proud they were to be attending the Games,\u2019 says Helen. \u2018I instantly knew that I had to take part and compete in 2015.\u2019\n\nSo Helen started training and taking her fitness really seriously \u2013 she was determined to prove that she could do it, and also wanted to help raise awareness in the process.\n\n\u2018I competed in the 100m, 200m and the archery. I secured a bronze medal in the archery and personal best times in the other two events. I was over the moon.\u2019\n\nOver the past few years, Helen has competed in archery, javelin and the 100m and she has taken home three gold, two silver and two bronze medals, as well as smashing numerous personal bests.\n\n\u2018Since first taking part in the Games, I\u2019ve proved to myself that I can overcome anything and have the mental and physical strength to do things I didn\u2019t think were possible after my transplants,\u2019 she adds.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really grateful to have been offered this opportunity to celebrate life alongside other donor recipients and their families.\n\n\u2018I feel incredibly lucky to have received two organ transplants and I will never forget what my brother did for me or what my donor\u2019s family went through to enable me to receive the lifesaving organ.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelen says that the British Transplant Games have opened up opportunities that she didn\u2019t think possible for her.\n\n\u2018I am now pleased to have as my friends not only other organ recipients, but also members of donor families who have made the generous decision in the hardest of times to honour their loved ones\u2019 wishes to be a donor.\n\n\u2018Attending The Games is like coming home to a whole new family and the opportunities that the Games bring to help raise awareness of organ donation are invaluable.\n\n\u2018The Games are now a massive part of my life and that of my family and friends as well.\u2019\n\nThree people die every day because there are not enough donation organs available. This is what Helen is hoping to change.\n\n\u2018I have been so lucky in receiving both of my transplants and I want to help ensure that more people can have the same opportunities that I have had.\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018The gift of life transforms the life of the person receiving the organ, but it goes wider than that and it affects the lives of their family and friends as well.\u2019\n\nMORE: Grandad becomes fastest 84-year-old in the world \u2013 after recovering from two heart attacks\n\nMORE: You Don\u2019t Look Sick: \u2018Crohn\u2019s is more than just lots of trips to the toilet\u2019\n\nMORE: Debenhams launches \u00a345 beauty advent calendar worth \u00a3190\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Helen had a kidney transplant and then a liver transplant a few years later.
