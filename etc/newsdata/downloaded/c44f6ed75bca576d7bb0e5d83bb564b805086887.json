Crime)\n\nTrue crime documentaries might be everyone\u2019s latest obsession, but many have been left wondering whether the fresh look into old cases has ever helped justice be served.\n\nThere have been multiple cases where a documentary has unearthed new evidence which led to a conviction \u2013 or acquittal \u2013 of the suspects.\n\nThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\n\nThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst follows the disappearance of Robert Durst\u2019s wife Kathie in 1982, the execution-style killing of writer Susan Berman in 2000 and the death and dismemberment of his neighbour, Morris Black, in Galveston, Texas in 2001.\n\nRobert had been accused of involvement in the first two murders and confessed to the third, but was acquitted at trial.\n\nHowever, on the night before the final episode aired in 2015 on HBO, Robert was arrested in New Orleans on a first-degree murder charge related to Susan Berman\u2019s death following new evidence presented in the series.\n\nSince the documentary first aired, Robert Durst was arrested (Picture: Sky Crime)\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the 1999 letter written by Robert to Susan which had been unearthed by the filmmakers was the \u2018key new evidence\u2019 which lead the charges to be filed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the documentary led to Robert\u2019s arrest, his trial has been put back until January 2020 due to various factors including \u2018serious surgery\u2019.\n\nCapturing The Friedmans\n\nThe Jinx isn\u2019t the only documentary which affected the outcome of a case years down the line \u2013 Capturing The Friedmans helped Jesse Friedman to protest his innocence after being accused of child sexual abuse.\n\nThe investigation had begun into Jesse\u2019s dad, Arnold Friedman, in 1987 after a child pornography magazine was intercepted by the US Postal Service being sent from the Netherlands to his home.\n\nIt was discovered that Arnold taught computer classes to children at his home, and police began to suspect him of abusing his students.\n\nJesse Friedman has always protested his innocence (Picture: Sky Crime)\n\nDuring the wait for the trial, the Friedmans were allowed to remain in their home, where they took several home videos showing their lives at this time, for their own records.\n\nArnold\u2019s wife, Elaine, convinced him to confess to protect their son, Jesse, who was also under suspicion, but Jesse also later confessed in order to avoid a longer prison sentence.\n\nArnold died by suicide in prison in 1995, and Jesse was released from prison in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence.\n\nCapturing The Friedmans was released in 2003 and raised questions over Jesse\u2019s involvement and guilt, and Jesse still argues his innocence and has attempted to clear his name.\n\nWith the help of filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, several of the alleged victims and witnesses recanted their claims and the investigation was reopened by the district attorney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the reinvestigation didn\u2019t change the outcome and they upheld Jesse\u2019s guilt, he is still fighting to overturn his conviction, and Andrew has appeared in court on his behalf.\n\nThe Case Against Adnan Syed\n\nAnother cold case in which new evidence was found was the death of Hae Min Lee in 1999, which is the focus of The Case Against Adnan Syed.\n\nAdnan Syed is currently in prison for the murder of Hae Min Lee (Picture: Sky Crime)\n\nThe new documentary looks at Adnan\u2019s arrest for the murder, and the life in prison plus 30 year sentence he is currently serving since 2000, and revealed that he turned down a 2018 plea bargain that would have required him to serve four more years before release.\n\nThe case first drew new attention in 2014 after becoming the focus of a crime podcast, and the Innocence Project called for DNA testing of the physical evidence which was collected at the time of the murder.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by The Baltimore Sun earlier this year, prosecutors tested several items linked to the murder in mid-2018, but Adnan\u2019s DNA was not a match on any of them.\n\nThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, Capturing The Friedmans and The Case Against Adnan Syed are available on Sky Crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: The Disappearance of
