They talk about walking towards the pressure but this week the pressure is going to be chasing them down the street.\u201d\n\nJones said he didn\u2019t necessarily feel the pressure would make them vulnerable but insisted it was something they would have to address.\n\n\u201cThe busiest bloke in Tokyo this week will be Gilbert Enoke, their mental skills coach. They have to deal with all this pressure of winning the World Cup three times and it is potentially the last game for their greatest coach and they will be thinking about those things,\u201d he said.\n\nWith England having won only one of their past 16 games against the All Blacks, it is hardly surprising that Jones has been somewhat obsessing about them since the World Cup draw was made two-and-a-half years ago and their semi-final destiny became likely.\n\nThe teams have met only once since Jones took over, when the All Blacks won 16-15 at Twickenham a year ago after a late match-winning try for England was controversially ruled out.\n\n\u201cWe trialled some things in November against them and we can do things a little bit better in this game and now we have the opportunity to do it,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cIn the first meeting we had with the players (after taking over), we said we wanted to be the world\u2019s best team. You could see the ability was there, we just needed to change a few things, change the way we train, the way we play, the way we think. We have progressively done that over four years, and we have put ourselves in a good position at this World Cup now.\u201d\n\nJones also addressed what he considers the fickle nature of the coverage of his team, saying that after the Argentina game \u201cI was going to get sacked, Owen (Farrell) couldn\u2019t kick and there was going to be blood on the walls at Twickenham. Now we\u2019re 80 minutes away from a World Cup semi-final.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what we\u2019ve done as a team over the last four years, we\u2019ve had some great wins, we\u2019ve had some significant losses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learnt from those and there is a togetherness in this team that will carry them through.\n\n\u201cIn a semi-final there will be big moments that will decide the game. I think we are well equipped to handle those moments,\u201d Jones said.", "description": "Eddie Jones went into his usual pre-match attack mode on Tuesday when he insisted that New Zealand would be buckling under the pressure of trying to retain the World Cup, while his England team had nothing to lose in their eagerly awaited semi-final.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443655175&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0MX", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
