Earlier this summer, a first-of-its-kind bill that would effectively eliminate anonymous American shell companies was passed out of a House committee\u2014a significant victory in the fight against kleptocrats, arms traffickers, and brutal regimes everywhere.\n\n\n\nIntroduced by Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney, and co-sponsored by several other Democrats along with Republican Representative Peter King, the Corporate Transparency Act would change the status quo\u2014in which almost anyone with some spare change jangling around their corrupt pockets could set up an anonymous shell company, easily masking their ill-gotten gains from prying eyes\u2014by forcing companies to identify their true, beneficial owners to American authorities. Tyrants and their cronies would neither be able to hide their assets behind the smiling fa\u00e7ade of Nevada and Wyoming company formation agents, nor use Delaware shell companies to anonymously launder their funds through Cleveland skyscrapers or Houston high-rises or Boise bungalows. Organizations that failed to comply with the bill\u2019s transparency standards would face federal charges and potential fines up to $10,000.\n\n\n\nThe legislation isn\u2019t perfect. The roster of beneficial owners behind these companies would remain private, rather than becoming immediately publicly accessible, thus leaving investigators both at home and abroad reliant on responses from American authorities to access the information. And the bill is facing pushback from small business organizations, such as the National Federation of Independent Businesses, who chafe at the punitive measures the legislation would bring to bear on firms deemed out of compliance, as well as the regularity with which such businesses would have to provide the necessary transparency.\n\nWhile Republican Patrick McHenry, the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, doesn\u2019t seem to oppose the effort with significant vigor, he has expressed qualms over the privacy issues involved in what he calls \u201canother new government database that will be collecting and housing personal identifiable information.\u201d Maloney, in a recent amendment to the bill, attempted to address these concerns by adding additional \u201crobust privacy safeguards\u201d ensuring that the data collected would only be shared with law enforcement and the relevant federal oversight agencies. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from Democrats and Republican offices that they are concerned about the privacy of beneficial ownership information,\u201d she says. \u201cI took their concerns very seriously.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a stretch to conclude that making an effort to ensure one\u2019s business is not in cahoots with human traffickers, narco-terrorists, and foreign dictators is some kind of undue regulatory burden. But those criticisms of the bill\u2014many of which come from self-styled libertarians\u2014emerge from the same rationale that allowed shell companies to flourish in the first place. The people opposed to this transparency would prefer to profit, rather than prod for answers about whether they\u2019re helping unravel democracy and entrench extremist networks abroad. Looking the other way won\u2019t change the fact that American shell company formation has done tremendous damage to countries already ransacked by savage regimes, from Russia to Kazakhstan to Equatorial Guinea\u2014and by extension, American national security writ large.", "description": "New legislation in Congress aims to impose much-needed transparency on anonymous shell companies.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/7594f9f6717d64ac06d80d57829a8e70d0528f1b.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
