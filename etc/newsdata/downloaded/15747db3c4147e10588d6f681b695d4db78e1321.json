You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFrance\u2019s southwest Basque coast doesn\u2019t have the glam of the southeast \u2013 but that\u2019s the charm. For starters, it\u2019s windy here; so come to do all kinds of activities that are suffixed by \u201csurf\u201d. The city has a handful of smart beaches to choose from, but you can\u2019t go wrong with the Grand Plage. There\u2019s a distinct Fifties vibe, with candy-coloured striped umbrellas and windswept promontories fronting Biarritz\u2019s art deco buildings.\n\ntourisme.biarritz.fr/en\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Stretching south from Renaissance-era Ibiza Town, this strip of sand is popular with more than glam holidaymakers. On its shores are the megalith open-air club/hotel hybrid Ushuaia and music-focused Hard Rock Ibiza, which host the White Isle\u2019s best talent each season. The Ushuaia closing party this year takes place on 2 October, with superstar DJ David Guetta playing his last show on 30 September.\n\ntheushuaiaexperience.com/en/\n\nValencia, Spain\n\nUsually overlooked in favour of neighbouring Barcelona, Valencia has a bigger and better city beach. Wide, sandy El Cabanyal is easily accessible from the city in just 15 minutes by the very efficient tram system, and the beach promenade runs the entire length with restaurants, bars and cafes. While in town, stop by the hemispheric City of Arts and Sciences, designed by starchitect Santiago Calatrava.\n\nvisitvalencia.com/en\n\nGdansk, Poland\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But consider Jelitkowo beach, a peaceful stretch of sand popular with Gdansk\u2019s families, easily reached by tram. But also consider that come autumn, the Baltic Sea isn\u2019t the warmest\u2026\n\nvisitgdansk.com/en/\n\nIschia, Italy\n\nVolcanic Ischia, long overshadowed by neighbouring Capri in the Bay of Naples, has so may beautiful beaches that it\u2019s hard to choose a favourite. The crescent-shaped Spiaggia dei Maronti on the south side of the island, immortalised in Elena Ferrante\u2019s My Brilliant Friend, just clinches it. Plus, the Cavascure Natural Springs is right behind, where the water is naturally warmed by the island\u2019s geothermal heat.\n\nitalia.it\n\nMallorca, Spain\n\nThe second you leave the party resort of Magaluf behind, this Balearic island brims over with beauty and has no shortage of idyllic sandy beaches set in sheltered bays. A personal favourite is Cala Llombards to the south-east of the island \u2013 the water is usually a brilliant turquoise and as clear as anything you\u2019ll find in the Caribbean, while the landscape is lent an air of drama by rocky outcrops dotted with scrubby trees.\n\ninfomallorca.net\n\nSicily, Italy\n\nThe largest island in the Mediterranean has sandy beaches galore; the only problem is choosing which one to spend the day at. Calamosche, to the south-east, sits within a nature reserve. It\u2019s a world away from a slick beach resort \u2013 be prepared to walk 20 minutes from the car park and take everything you need for day, including water, snacks, suncream, towels and umbrellas \u2013 but what it lacks in facilities it makes up for in the clearest water, protected from the wind by cliffs, and a wild, unkempt beauty.\n\nvisitsicily.info/en\n\nGozo, Malta\n\nThe tiny island of Gozo off the coast of Malta is definitely worth the trip for the food alone (don't miss the local sheep cheese: pale, creamy and steeped in wine, black pepper and olive oil). Beach-wise, check out the small but perfectly formed Hondoq Ir-Rummien, a local\u2019s favourite known for golden sand and clear waters. Directly opposite the island of Comino, it\u2019s reached through the village of il-Qala and is a top spot for diving and swimming (and even beach barbecues of an evening).\n\nvisitgozo.com\n\nCascais and beyond, Portugal\n\nThe beaches dotted along the Portuguese coast west of Lisbon have a couple of things to recommend them: firstly, they\u2019re accessible by a cheap and regular train service (great news for non-drivers); second, they\u2019re just a 30-minute to an hour hop away from the Portuguese capital, making for a perfect city/seaside combination. Choose from stops Cruz Quebrada, Caxias, Santo Amaro, Parede and Estoril for nearby sandy beaches, or plump for Cascais itself at the end of the line, which is a proper resort town. The sea in these parts can get choppy, which also makes it a brilliant destination for surfers.\n\nvisitcascais.com\n\nCorfu, Greece\n\nThe Greek isle of Corfu is awash with Venetian architecture and glorious beaches lapped by the Ionian Sea. Spilios Beach is tucked away on the east of the island, coupling soft sand with sapphire water that's often calm as a millpond. It's biggest boon is the large number of loungers and parasols, which are completely free to use for the day. There's also a boat hire shop on the shore if you fancy chartering a vessel and exploring further afield.\n\nvisitgreece.gr", "description": "Summer may already feel like an age ago, but there's still a window to catch some sun in Europe before the winter sets in (and we potentially crash out of the Union come 31 October...).
