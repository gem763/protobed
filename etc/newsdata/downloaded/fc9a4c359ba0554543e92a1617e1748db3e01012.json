The ship's master did not survive.\n\nThe report found the catamaran began to fall apart 30 minutes into the journey and had split and sank after two hours.\n\nIt said there was no leadership from the crew, who had limited survival training.\n\nIt blamed the slow rescue response on a lack of information provided by the ship's crew, recommending stricter maritime policing to ensure reporting procedures were properly followed.\n\nIt also called for a tighter inspection regime and better boat building standards.", "description": "Crew members of an overloaded Kiribati ferry which sank in the Pacific claiming 95 lives were drunk, leaving passengers to die slow deaths from starvation and hypothermia, a damning report has found.  \"Most, if not all, victims died from hunger, dehydration and hypothermia,\" it found.
