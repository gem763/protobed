It's like all of your power has been taken away, and I'm very much about how can we hold on to our power in order to deal with hospitals, doctors, people who have qualifications - it's intimidating,' she said.\n\n'How do we retain that so we still have authority over ourselves?'\n\nShe added: 'It's obviously part of one's life, whether it's cancer or another disease or chronic condition, but the point is, it's life. It's living.\n\nShe explained how she likes to hold onto an 'attitude of gratitude' with her at all times, even if she has to 'fake it'.\n\nLeah Bracknell as Zoe Tate in Emmerdale\n\nIn October of last year, Leah revealed she lived 14 months longer than was expected when she was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2016\n\nA statement from Bracknell's manager said: 'It is with the deepest sadness that Leah Bracknell's family confirm that Leah passed away in September, three years after her diagnosis with stage 4 lung cancer\n\nHundreds have paid tribute to the actress on Twitter (above and below), with many describing how inspirational her character was on Twitter\n\nToday, a statement was issued by Bracknell's manager, which said: 'It is with the deepest sadness that Leah Bracknell's family confirm that Leah passed away in September, three years after her diagnosis with stage 4 lung cancer.\n\n'They would like to thank all the public for their support and generosity which contributed to the extension and quality of her life over the past three years.\n\n'Leah continued to embrace life and faced her illness with positivity.
