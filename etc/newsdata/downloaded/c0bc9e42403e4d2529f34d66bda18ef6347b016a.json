Fura spokeswoman Rosey Perkins said: \u201cAll allegations concerning safety and especially our employees are taken seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of mechanizing the mine and adapting operations and safety standards to comply with Colombian and broader international regulations,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nThe alleged problems at Coscuez illustrate the challenges for Colombia in properly regulating miners, as it seeks to garner investment from big-name gold and gem companies.\n\nColombia\u2019s National Mining Agency (ANM) \u2014 which regulates the sector \u2014 told Reuters it was carrying out a rare sanction process against the company, which was at the notification stage. ANM inspectors most recently visited the mine in March.\n\nFura managers said they were unaware of the sanction and the ANM declined to provide further details. The agency said, however, the fine was equivalent to about $4,900.\n\nAround 6 per cent of mines in Colombia are fined or shuttered per year, it added.\n\nThe ANM said it made recommendations regarding worker equipment and asked Fura to adjust ventilation in the mine tunnel, but did not provide specifics.\n\nFura\u2019s license expires in December 2020. The ANM said that its policy was not to consider the viability of any renewal unless a mine is complying with all regulations.\n\nMISSING EQUIPMENT\n\nAbout 120 of Fura\u2019s employees work underground. Miners work 12-hour shifts for 14 days, the company said, then take seven days off.\n\nAbout 70 per cent of the company\u2019s workers are lacking at least one piece of equipment, according to one source familiar with Fura\u2019s safety measures.\n\nWorkers are given a mish-mash of supplies \u2014 for example, assigned emergency oxygen masks but no gloves \u2014 the ex-employee said.\n\nDuring an unannounced visit to the mine, Reuters reporters were taken on a tour steps behind a third-party inspector hired by the mine, who was on a scheduled visit.\n\nReuters saw three jackhammer operators without eye protection in a tunnel and many workers who were not wearing the top part of their safety overalls. Some miners had no gloves or gas masks.\n\nWhen asked by Reuters whether they were provided with eye protection, one of the jackhammer operators said he reported his broken glasses but had not received a replacement.\n\nThe mine\u2019s managing director Rahul Gopal, who accompanied Reuters on the tour, said there was \u201cno chance\u201d workers were going without needed equipment, adding that not all workers required every piece of gear.\n\nWorkers in Fura\u2019s mine have repeatedly been hurt by falling rocks because they lacked protective gear, the former employees said. They said in one incident falling rocks hurt a worker\u2019s feet, while other employees have suffered cuts.\n\nAnother employee suffered burns on his back after being scalded by hot water, one of his former colleagues said.\n\nDeputy general manager Alcides Paiva said there were 45 accidents between January and mid-September, ranging from trivial incidents to more serious ones. Fura confirmed details about the burned worker and showed Reuters reports on workers injured by falling rocks and an overturned vehicle.\n\nDuring the nine months of 2018 that the mine was operating, there were 53 accidents, he added.\n\nThe ANM said it only keeps records for more serious emergencies where a worker\u2019s life was endangered. On average in recent years, there has been 86 such emergencies annually across Colombia\u2019s mining industry, it said.\n\nThe labour ministry said it had a record of only one accident \u2014 classified as \u201cserious\u201d \u2014 at Fura so far this year and said it had no knowledge of the other allegations.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "At the Colombian emerald mine run by Canada's Fura Gems, workers lack basic safety equipment like masks and safety glasses", "authors": ["Julia Symmes Cobb"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/colombia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
