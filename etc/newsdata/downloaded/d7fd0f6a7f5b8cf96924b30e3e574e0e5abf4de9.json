The State Department special representative for Iran is in a commanding position over the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive approach toward a longstanding U.S. adversary. Less than a year since President Trump abandoned the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, the State and Treasury departments have slapped sanctions on nearly 1,000 people and entities to tighten the screws on Tehran.\n\nAnd while staffers typically have short shelf lives in the Trump administration, Hook has managed to become a lasting and growing presence. He\u2019s the rare member of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s inner circle to have thrived under successor Mike Pompeo. According to two sources with direct knowledge, Hook has also cultivated ties at the White House with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2014something that bedeviled Tillerson\u2014and Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt. Last month he traveled with Kushner to Saudi Arabia to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\n\nBut there\u2019s a cloud over Hook. Two sources told The Daily Beast that the State Department inspector general is in the final stages of a probe into reprisals against career department personnel for their perceived disloyalty to the president. Those sources said Hook is amongst at least eight administration officials the inspector general is examining.\n\nRepresentatives Eliot Engel and Elijah Cummings in August 2018 expressed alarm about Hook\u2019s appointment as the special representative for Iran given the allegations. \u201cInternal documents... show [Hook] engaging in significant acts of political retaliation against career State Department employees,\u201d they wrote to Pompeo.\n\n\u201c Internal documents...show [Hook] engaging in significant acts of political retaliation against career State Department employees. \u201d \u2014 Reps. Eliot Engel and Elijah Cummings\n\n\u201cThe personnel accusation is without merit and has no evidentiary, procedural, or legal basis,\u201d said a State Department official.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report is highly anticipated on Capitol Hill. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is set to question Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Wednesday on the department\u2019s budget but members also plan to confront him about the allegations.\n\nBeyond what the watchdog concludes, Hook and his colleagues face concern stretching from Washington to Europe to the Middle East over where the administration\u2019s approach to Iran will lead. (Through a spokesperson, Hook declined to comment for this article.) Several senior officials insist their goal isn\u2019t regime change, and last year, Pompeo laid out an expansive set of conditions that amount to a wholesale transformation of Iranian foreign policy that Pompeo said could anchor a potential diplomatic accord. But there\u2019s no sign of that accord on the horizon, raising questions over how much will be achieved by what Pompeo called \u201cunprecedented financial pressure.\u201d\n\nOutside of Washington foreign policy circles, Hook is an obscure figure, despite his substantial influence over one of the most combustible geopolitical issues the administration confronts. But inside those realms, Hook has substantial influence.\n\nHe\u2019s a bridge to the traditional GOP internationalist foreign policy wing that has largely scorned Trump. A former Hill aide, Hook worked at the Justice Department and then the White House under George W. Bush before transitioning to the U.S. delegation to the U.N., where he worked with U.N. ambassadors John Bolton and Zalmay Khalilizad on, among other things, Iran and sanctions issues, something he kept up during a brief 2008 turn as an assistant secretary of state.\n\nAfter that, Hook was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign and then was tight with Republican foreign-policy stalwarts who became Never Trumpers. While Hook never signed on to their denunciations of Trump, he expressed his reservations. \u201cEven if you say you support him as the nominee, you go down the list of his positions and you see you disagree on every one,\u201d Politico quoted Hook saying in May 2016. Still, his foreign policy experience endeared him to Tillerson, who gave Hook the prestige of running State\u2019s policy-planning shop, a job first held by George Kennan.\n\n\u201c Brian is not an ideologue by any means... He is a critic of the deal. But the fact that he stuck around between Tillerson and Pompeo shows he is a bureaucratic player. \u201d \u2014 Obama administration official\n\n\u201cHe has a close relationship with Pompeo from what I can tell, and has been central to the secretary\u2019s efforts on Iran,\u201d said a frequent Hook interlocutor, Mark Dubowitz of the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\n\u201cBrian is well-respected. He\u2019s not an ideologue by any means,\u201d said a former senior Obama administration official who worked directly on the accord with Iran. \u201cHe is a critic of the deal. But the fact that he stuck around between Tillerson and Pompeo shows he is a bureaucratic player.\u201d\n\nOthers who\u2019ve worked with Hook during the Trump administration put it differently. \u201cHe does what\u2019s expedient to get him ahead. He\u2019s an opportunist,\u201d said a State Department official.\n\nOn the campaign trail, President Trump sold supporters on the idea that he would pull out of the Iran deal. In May 2018, when he officially announced the withdrawal, Trump said the pact was \u201cone of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\u201d\n\nUnder that deal, negotiated by the Obama administration, Iran agreed to significantly diminish its uranium stockpiles, cut its enrichment levels and reduce the number of centrifuges in the country. In exchange for Iranian compliance\u2014which international nuclear watchdogs say still exists today\u2014the U.S. and the EU lifted oil and trade-related sanctions on Iran. Sanctions on Iran\u2019s banking system were also dropped.\n\nBut conservative lawmakers, activists and experts immediately rejected the deal\u2014known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA \u2014 contending that it was a financial windfall to a hostile power. Iran would be unconstrained after aspects of the JCPOA\u2019s provisions expired, they said, which didn\u2019t require Iran to abandon its missile development, let alone what Washington\u2019s Israeli and Gulf Arab allies view as regional aggression.\n\nFormer Treasury and White House officials said the outgoing Obama team knew there was a high possibility that the incoming administration would make changes to the Iran deal. But how Team Trump planned to address the deal was unclear: would they tear it up immediately, expand the deal, extract concessions from European allies for keeping the deal, or structure a withdrawal?\n\nEnter Hook.\n\nWhen Hook came into the State Department in early 2017, Tillerson, who favored staying in the deal, gave him a substantial Iran-related brief. Hook became envoy to three pivotal allies\u2014France, Britain and Germany, known as the E3\u2014about expanding the scope of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to extend its lifespan and add restrictions on Iran\u2019s missile development. That was a priority for Tillerson as part of a failed effort to keep Trump from violating the Iran deal. It didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201c [There's] much more is to come. As Secretary Pompeo has said, the regime can behave like a normal nation or watch its economy crumble. \u201d \u2014 State Department official\n\nHook had called the deal \u201cdisastrous\u201d in a November 2015 Weekly Standard article, but once at State, colleagues found it difficult to disentangle his position from Tillerson\u2019s. Observations vary. Dubowitz, a tenacious critic of the accord who preferred amending it to abandoning it, said he thought Hook negotiated with the Europeans \u201cin good faith,\u201d even if the negotiations turned out not to have moved the Europeans to the position the administration wanted, particularly on the 2021 expirations of certain provisions. But a former State Department official who worked with Hook was skeptical.\n\n\u201cHe was opposed. It was very clear he was extremely suspicious of anyone who worked on the deal,\u201d the former official said.\n\nBut colleagues suspected something was at work with Hook beyond antipathy to the Iran deal. \u201cEveryone, early on in those days, got the sense that whether you would survive in the administration was a question. He was doing what he needed to do to seem on Team Trump,\u201d said a second State Department official who wasn\u2019t cleared to talk to reporters.\n\nThough Hook had his own expertise on Iran stemming from his time at State in the Bush administration, he enlisted outside advisers from FDD, the think tank that led the charge against the Iran deal.\n\nTaking lead was Dubowitz, FDD\u2019s chief executive, who didn\u2019t know Hook personally until the Trump administration, \u201cthough I knew him by his stellar reputation.\u201d Dubowitz ran point for an FDD Iran team that tapped specialists for advice on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, internal Iranian government dynamics, its economy, illicit finance, associated Mideast regional issues and sanctions.\n\n\u201cI was involved extensively in helping Brian and his team through the U.S.-E3 negotiations,\u201d Dubowitz said. \u201cWe were involved in supporting Brian and his team on the core of a supplemental agreement [to the Iran deal], and prior to that, worked closely on framing an Iran strategy and thinking through various aspects of that strategy.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s Iran policy is also intertwined with its overall approach to the Middle East. Several individuals with direct knowledge said Kushner\u2019s push for Middle East peace was motivated, in part, by countering Iran\u2019s influence in the region. Hook last month went to Riyadh with Kushner to talk about the peace plan with members of the Saudi Royal Court and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\n\nAfter quitting the Iran deal, the administration focused its efforts on creating a massive and new series of sanctions. Treasury Department sources told The Daily Beast that the Iran portfolio is by far the most active in the Office of Foreign Asset Control.\n\n\u201cThe lines of effort are to change the regime\u2019s behavior, restore deterrence against all threats, and support the Iranian people in their demands for a more representative government,\u201d a State Department official said. \u201cThere exists no past precedent for Iran changing its behavior absent strong economic and diplomatic pressure. This approach has worked in the past and there\u2019s every reason to believe it will work again.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign has at times suggested a military confrontation. Last year, Bolton, now Trump\u2019s national security adviser, raised eyebrows by stating the U.S. military would remain in Syria until Iranian proxy groups left, something the Pentagon denied was its goal. It remains unclear to observers if the administration is containing Iran, seeking to overthrow its regime or pressuring it indefinitely.\n\nThat\u2019s because Iran, American officials have conceded, has yet to appreciably change its behavior. The State official said it\u2019s only been five months since oil and financial sanctions returned from their suspension under the JCPOA, but noted that Iran\u2019s budget submission this month saw a substantial cut to military funding. The official promised that \u201cmuch more is to come. As Secretary Pompeo has said, the regime can behave like a normal nation or watch its economy crumble.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions are \u201caimed at depriving the regime of the revenues that it uses to spread death and destruction around the world,\u201d Pompeo said in November 2018. \u201cOur ultimate aim is to compel Iran to permanently abandon its well-documented outlaw activities and behave as a normal country.\u201d\n\nBut while he helped America turn the screws on Iran\u2019s economy, a controversy has dogged Hook from practically the beginning of his time in the administration.\n\nIn early 2017, a career official and Iran expert, Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, had her assignment to Hook\u2019s policy-planning directorate cut short. It followed a damaging article in Conservative Review that said Nowrouzzadeh, an \u201cIran deal architect,\u201d had \u201cburrowed into the government under President Trump.\u201d Nowrouzzadeh had started her government career at the Defense Department during the Bush administration.\n\nThe article lit a fire in right-wing circles and quickly migrated to the State Department. David Wurmser, a former aide to Dick Cheney, emailed it to Newt Gingrich on Mar. 14, 2017, commenting \u201cI think a cleaning is in order\u201d at State. Gingrich sent it to Margaret Peterlin, Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff who, as CNN first reported, passed it to deputy Christine Ciccone and White House liaison Matthew Mowers. \u201cWe\u2019re working with Brian [Hook] on how best to organize his team and have discussed where Sahar, a career employee detailed to that office previously, may be of best use to the agency if not in\u201d policy planning.\n\nHook received the article separately and sent it to a career staffer in the policy planning office, Edward Lacey. Lacey, in an email first reported by Politico, called Nowrouzzadeh and other colleagues \u201cObama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nLacey then told Hook, \u201cI succeeded in ousting five whose details expired before your arrival.\u201d\n\nHook replied, \u201cEd\u2013 This is helpful. Let\u2019s discuss on Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201c I\u2019m outraged by reports that State Department employees have faced unfair treatment and retaliation for their perceived political beliefs, national origin, ethnicity or other prohibited reasons. \u201d \u2014 Rep. Elliot Engel\n\nThat same morning, in an email that subsequently caught the eye of House Democrats and the State Department inspector general, Nowrouzzadeh reached out to Hook for help over the \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cmisinformation\u201d-filled Conservative Review article.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve adapted my work to the policy priorities of every administration I have worked for,\u201d she told Hook\u2014who forwarded her email to Lacey. Nowrouzzadeh \u201chelped promote and defend the JCPOA\u2014I would say, with enthusiasm,\u201d Lacey replied.\n\nSoon afterward, Nowrouzzadeh, whose stint at Policy Planning was supposed to last until July 2017, was reassigned to the Department\u2019s Near East bureau. On Apr. 21, Politico reported Nowrouzzadeh\u2019s reassignment. Emails obtained by The Daily Beast showed State officials attempting to craft a response for the piece that Nowrouzzadeh said was untrue. \u201c[H]ow about saying something like: \u2018It is regular practice for detailees to return to their parent office at the completion of their detail assignments,\u2019\u201d Lacey emailed colleagues on Apr. 17, 2017.\n\nNowrouzzadeh replied: \u201cEd\u2014My assignment was not \u2018completed.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce the piece was published, Hook emailed Tillerson press aide RC Hammond calling it \u201ca ludicrous story. At least we aren\u2019t named.\u201d\n\nFour days later, Hook sent himself an email, also obtained by The Daily Beast, with the subject \u201cDerek notes.\u201d Two powerful House Democrats, Engel and Cummings, said that referred to then-National Security Council Mideast director Derek Harvey, who now works for Rep. Devin Nunes.\n\n(Asked for comment, Nunes spokesman Jack Langer said: \u201cYou\u2019d think with their two-year-long string of discredited stories alleging Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, The Daily Beast would stop relying on leaked and spun information fed to them by partisan sources. Clearly, that lesson has not been learned.\u201d)\n\nHook indicates in the \u201cDerek notes\u201d email that Nowrouzzadeh was a subject of conversation . Hook also appears to memorialize a conversation about other individuals in the administration, using the words \u201cleaker,\u201d \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d \u201cWork to damage president,\u201d \u201cTurncoat who said we have to resist.\u201d The email doesn\u2019t indicate anywhere that Hook was outlining his own perspective.\n\nAnother \u201cbig trouble maker\u201d identified in the email is Brett McGurk, then the envoy to America\u2019s allies against the so-called Islamic State; Hook\u2019s interlocutor envisioned \u201clet[ing McGurk\u2019s] office wind down\u201d even as the battle to recapture Mosul raged. McGurk, who resigned in December 2018 after Trump decided to withdraw from Syria, declined comment.\n\nThe State Department did not comment on the record for this story. But two sources tell The Daily Beast that the inspector general interviewed its last witness for its probe into Hook and others\u2019 potential political retaliation against Nowrouzzadeh and the other career officials.\n\n\u201cOur review and report of allegations of political retaliation against Department of State employees are still in process,\u201d said Sarah Breen, a spokesperson for the inspector general, who said that office plans to issue a public report detailing its findings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m outraged by reports that State Department employees have faced unfair treatment and retaliation for their perceived political beliefs, national origin, ethnicity or other prohibited reasons,\u201d Engel told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply disappointed that despite numerous requests from the Foreign Affairs Committee and other Members of Congress, the State Department refuses to explain how they are handling this serious issue. It makes me wonder: what is the Department trying to hide?\u201d\n\nThat question could be addressed soon. Sources say the committee is prepared to hold a hearing on the inspector general\u2019s investigation in the next two months.", "description": "Brian Hook is driving an aggressive Iran policy... while he and several other officials have to deal with a far-reaching probe into allegations of political reprisal.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Spencer Ackerman", "National Security Reporter", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1553652736/190326-banco-ackerman-hook-tease-3_nd0tso", "published_at": "2019-03-27"}
