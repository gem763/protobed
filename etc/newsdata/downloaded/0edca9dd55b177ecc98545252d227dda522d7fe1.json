Bush\u2019s administration has been reunited with her owner 12 years -- and two presidents \u2013 later in Pittsburgh.\n\nDutchess, a fox terrier who is now 14-years-old, went missing in southern Florida more than 12 years ago on Feb. 28, 2007.\n\nShe was discovered last week on Oct. 8 hungry and shivering underneath a shed in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, according to ABC News\u2019 Pittsburgh affiliate WTAE.\n\nShe was brought to Humane Animal Rescue\u2019s North Side Animal Resource Center that evening to be taken care of and it was during her exam that a microchip was found and her owners were discovered to be in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nPerhaps understandably, Dutchess\u2019 owners were in shock when they got the call from the Humane Animal Rescue staff.\n\nSteve Mellon/AP\n\n\"I can't believe you're calling me right now. I can't believe this is happening,\" owner Katheryn Strang said.\n\nStrang immediately made plans to make the 18 hour drive to Pittsburgh to reunite with Dutchess. She arrived on Friday afternoon.\n\nEmotional video of their reunion was posted to Facebook by the shelter that took care of Dutchess while they awaited for Strang to come pick her up.\n\nIt is roughly 1,130 miles from Boca Raton and Pittsburgh. It is not known how Dutchess made the long journey there or how she survived for the past 12 years.\n\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d said Strang to Dutchess when she first held on to her for the first time in over 12 years. \u201cBaby, where have you been?\u201d", "description": "A dog that went missing in Florida during George W.
