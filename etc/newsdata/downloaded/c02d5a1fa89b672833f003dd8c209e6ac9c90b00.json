It treats and stores data related to millions of citizens on benefits. The federal data processing service, Serpro, is also on the privatization list.\n\nThe document, forwarded to the Lower House of the Congress, poses questions around what will happen to the personal data belonging to millions of Brazilians that both Dataprev and Serpro handle, crucially around benefits and tax.\n\nRead this ZDNet Great Debate: Do democracies really need to spy on their citizens?

No statements from the government have been made so far about what measures will be taken to mitigate any risks to data post-privatization of the tech firms.\n\nBoth Dataprev and Serpro are accountable for the development, maintenance, and operations of thousands of government systems. In addition to the platform underpinning tax reporting and social security payments to over 35 million people and wages of millions of public servants, it also develops innovations such a mobile app that uses biometrics to confirm a citizen receiving benefits is alive, released this month.\n\nAs well as arguing that Dataprev is profitable and does not rely on federal funds, the manifesto argued that organizations responsible for such a massive repository of critical data should not be on the privatization list.\n\n\"By relinquishing its own technology to buy third-party solutions, giving up the possibility of developing technologies in this field and becoming just a passive consumer, Brazil is moving in the opposite direction when compared to developed countries,\" the document noted.\n\n\"This is a policy that will widen the gap that separates us from other nations that focus on investing in research and technology.\"", "description": "A manifesto released by the employees at one of the state-controlled firms to be privatized by the government raises concerns over the future of information belonging to millions of citizens.", "authors": ["Angelica Mari"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/31/4529c708-d53d-4bcf-8771-07c9eea3e945/thumbnail/770x578/0135ed8fd7238af1906540153fd1ee5f/data.png"}
