REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nAn intervention by Chinese troops could seriously damage Hong Kong\u2019s standing as a stable international financial center and a gateway for global capital flowing into the world\u2019s second-largest economy. No other Chinese city, not even Shanghai, could step into that role in the foreseeable future.\n\nWHY DOES CHINA NEED HONG KONG AS IT IS?\n\nWhile China still has extensive capital controls and often intervenes in its financial markets and banking system, Hong Kong is one of the most open economies in the world and one of the biggest markets for equity and debt financing.\n\nThe size of Hong Kong\u2019s economy may only be equivalent to 2.7% of mainland China\u2019s now, down from 18.4% in 1997 when it reverted to Chinese rule, but the territory punches above its weight due to its world-class financial and legal systems.\n\nAll that is possible due to its unique system of governance.\n\nUnder the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 formula agreed as part of Britain\u2019s handover of the territory to China, Hong Kong is guaranteed liberties which are unavailable on the mainland such as freedom of expression and an independent judiciary.\n\nThese freedoms give Hong Kong a special status internationally, allowing it to negotiate trade and investment agreements independently from Beijing \u2014 for instance, it does not have to pay the tariffs that the United States is imposing on Chinese imports.\n\nThey also mean foreign investors have more faith in Hong Kong\u2019s legal and governance systems. China\u2019s legal system is accountable to the Communist Party.\n\nGRAPHIC: HK GDP shrinking share of China GDP - here\n\nWHAT IS AT STAKE?\n\nChina uses Hong Kong\u2019s currency, equity and debt markets to attract foreign funds, while international companies use Hong Kong as a launchpad to expand into mainland China. The bulk of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China continues to be channeled through the city.\n\nMost of China\u2019s biggest firms, from state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, to private firms like Tencent Holdings, have listed in Hong Kong, often as a springboard to global expansion. Last year, Chinese companies raised $64.2 billion globally - almost a third of the worldwide total - via initial public offerings (IPOs), but just $19.7 billion of that came from listings in Shanghai or Shenzhen, according to data from Refinitiv, compared with $35 billion in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cConnect\u201d schemes linking the Hong Kong bourse with those in Shanghai and Shenzhen also provide the main gateway for foreigners to buy mainland stocks.\n\nChinese businesses also tapped Hong Kong\u2019s debt market for 33% of their $165.9 billion in offshore U.S. dollar funding last year, Refinitiv data shows.\n\nGRAPHIC: HK hosts most offshore Chinese IPO - here\n\nGRAPHIC: Hong Kong share of Chinese USD bonds Refinitiv - here\n\nChinese banks hold more assets in Hong Kong \u2014 $1.1 trillion in 2018 \u2014 than lenders from any other region, according to Hong Kong Monetary Authority\u2019s data compiled by Natixis. That figure equates to roughly 9% of China\u2019s GDP.\n\nLosing such a massive financing channel risks destabilizing the already slowing Chinese economy, hurting confidence that the Communist Party can continue to deliver prosperity after a strong, decades-long track record. Among other deep linkages, Hong Kong\u2019s port continues to handle a hefty share of China\u2019s exports and imports, and the city was also China\u2019s largest trade partner in services in 2018 with its market share of over 20% topping the U.S.\u2019s 17%, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry says.\n\nHong Kong also has been pivotal to China\u2019s longer-term ambition to turn the yuan into a widely-used international currency, competing with the U.S. dollar. While still a long way out, achieving that goal would increase the world\u2019s stake in China\u2019s success, as well as Beijing\u2019s influence.\n\nGRAPHIC: Chinese bank assets in HK Natixis HKMA - here\n\nGRAPHIC: Total Bank Assets by Region, Natixis HKMA - here\n\nFILE PHOTO: People take part in a general strike at Tamar Park in front of the government buildings in Hong Kong, China September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nHOW COULD IT ALL UNRAVEL?\n\nBeijing has said it would not sit idly by if the unrest in Hong Kong threatened Chinese security and sovereignty. Chinese officials have said the events in Hong Kong were an internal matter and denounced foreign interference. But many world leaders have urged restraint.\n\nSome U.S. senators have threatened to amend the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act and stop treating it as a separate customs area from the mainland. That hinges on their assessment that Hong Kong is sufficiently independent from Beijing. Any action by mainland troops is likely to be a decisive factor in making that call.\n\nEven if Beijing doesn\u2019t resort to the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d of using troops, signs of more open and direct interference in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs and continued street clashes could prompt global investors to seek other low-tax financial centers with highly-respected legal systems, such as Singapore.", "description": "Concerns over Hong Kong's political and economic future are growing as pro-democracy protests drag on and turn increasingly violent, and China makes clear that forceful intervention is possible.", "authors": ["Noah Sin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426337984&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832IK"}
