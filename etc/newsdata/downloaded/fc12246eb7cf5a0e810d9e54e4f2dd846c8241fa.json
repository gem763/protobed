REUTERS/Amit Dave/Files\n\n\u201cDemand from west African countries is weak for non-basmati rice. They have bought a lot from China and don\u2019t need to buy huge volumes now,\u201d said Nitin Gupta, vice president of Olam India\u2019s rice business.\n\nIndia is the world\u2019s biggest rice exporter but its shipments have plunged 27% in the first five months of the 2019/20 financial year, starting on April 1, to 3.8 million tonnes, the data showed.\n\nIran, the biggest buyer of India\u2019s basmati rice, has nearly stopped purchases in the last few weeks as it harvests its own crop, said an exporter based in New Delhi, who declined to be identified.\n\n\u201cIran could resume buying early next year after harvesting the local crop,\u201d the exporter said.\n\nRice supplies from India\u2019s summer-sown crop are expected to improve from next month and this could moderate local prices and make exports competitive, Gupta said.\n\nLast month, the government had said that rice production from the summer-sown crop in 2019 was expected to drop 1.7% from a year ago to 100.35 million tonnes.\n\nNon-basmati rice exports could fall 40% in 2019/20 from a year ago unless the government provided some incentive for exports, said B V Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association (REA).\n\n\u201cThe industry badly needs government support to accelerate exports,\u201d Rao said.\n\nIndia exported 11.95 million tonnes of rice in 2018/19 through March 31, down 7.2% from the previous 12 months, even though it had provided incentives for exports of non-basmati rice for four months of the year.\n\nLower prices from competitors could also be a contributing factor to a fall in exports.\n\nIndia\u2019s 5% broken white rice was quoted at about $368-$372 per tonne this week compared with $350 for supplies from Vietnam.\n\nSmaller shipments from India could help rivals such as Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar raise their exports, according to Indian exporters.\n\nIt could also force Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government to buy more from farmers, even as it struggles to liquidate last year\u2019s stocks.\n\nIndia mainly exports non-basmati rice to Bangladesh, Nepal, Benin and Senegal, and premier basmati rice to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.", "description": "India's rice exports in August fell 29% year-on-year to 644,249 tonnes, government data showed on Thursday, due to weak demand from African countries for non-basmati rice, among other factors.", "authors": ["Rajendra Jadhav", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439234161&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990X5", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
