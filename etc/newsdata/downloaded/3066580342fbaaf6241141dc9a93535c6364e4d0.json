White House lawyers draw new scrutiny.", "language": "en", "text": "The questions being posed expose the delicate position any White House lawyers face who are tasked with handling investigations. Inevitably, the work they do often becomes part of the investigation itself. And with the Democratic-led House now launched on an impeachment investigation, it\u2019s the attorneys tasked with representing the presidential side of Trump who also must prepare to be on the receiving end of their own subpoenas.\n\n\u201cIt is a legitimate avenue of inquiry in an obstruction investigation,\u201d said Jane Sherburne, a former top White House lawyer who handled President Bill Clinton\u2019s responses to investigations by both Congress and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. \u201cWhether they are in legal jeopardy? It\u2019s hard to know, but certainly there\u2019s a risk, if not a likelihood, that they will be called to testify.\u201d\n\nSo far, there are three interrelated issued posing challenges inside the White House counsel\u2019s office, the catch-all location for all government issues dealing with the president and which Cipollone overhauled when he took over late last year.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the whistleblower complaint released on Thursday. It describes a July phone call in which Trump asked the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic front-runner, and reopen an inquiry into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. White House lawyers, according to the memo, directed their colleagues to \u201clock down\u201d the official word-for-word transcript of that call.\n\nThe second issue involves the role the White House lawyers played in delaying the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to Congress. Trump ultimately did not assert executive privilege over the document. But the roundabout way that decision was made and the length of time it took for the declassified complaint to make its way up to Capitol Hill \u2014 finally arriving for lawmakers to review in a secure room on Wednesday \u2014 have also become a fundamental facet of the Democratic-led inquiry.\n\nThird, and potentially most vexing to Trump\u2019s ability to defend himself should the House impeachment inquiry transition into a full-blown floor debate and then a Senate trial, is the wider role Cipollone and his team will even be able to play in the matter. The White House counsel\u2019s office had an integral role in defending Clinton in his 1998-99 impeachment. But the players in that effort also weren\u2019t witnesses themselves in the alleged misconduct.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, where the Trump impeachment inquiry has overtaken pretty much anything else of substance, even a handful of Republicans took issue on Thursday with the way the White House had appeared to handle the Ukraine matter.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning,\u201d Rep. Will Hurd, a retiring Texas Republican who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee subpanel that deals with constitutional issues, added: \u201cI don\u2019t know the names of all the players, but clearly the White House is interested in making as sure as possible that this, all of this, wouldn\u2019t see the light of day but for the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nFormal calls for Cipollone\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill still have yet to materialize. But he did face a deadline Thursday from three House committees investigating his office to submit all White House records connected to the Ukraine scandal, with a subpoena looming if he doesn\u2019t comply. There\u2019d been no movement as of Thursday night on the stand-off, though the chairmen of the panels did take issue with the president\u2019s latest comments about the whistleblower that the still-unidentified person was \u201calmost a spy\u201d who could be punished for treason.\n\n\u201cThreats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security,\u201d said the chairmen, Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Eliot Engel of New York and Elijah Cummings of Maryland.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nImpeachment itself is a new threat to the Trump lawyers \u2014 the White House did not respond to requests for comment for this article \u2014 though some of the ethical and legal issues they\u2019re facing aren\u2019t new. The president\u2019s first White House counsel, Don McGahn, recused himself and his entire office from having any involvement in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation after determining they\u2019d been central to several of the key events in the middle of it, including the firings of national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James Comey.\n\nMcGahn himself is mentioned 529 times in the final Mueller report , and his testimony is at the crux of the case that the president committed multiple acts of obstruction of justice in his attempts to stymie or outright stop the Russia probe. At least two of McGahn\u2019s top aides were also interviewed by the Mueller investigators, and notes taken by his chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, quickly drew the ire of Trump.\n\nIn the case of the Ukraine scandal, Trump\u2019s White House isn\u2019t dealing with a special counsel or Justice Department criminal investigation. But the impeachment effort is a very real live-fire exercise, and a showdown over demands for their testimony and any requests for executive privilege could quickly find their way into federal court.\n\nTy Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer hired specifically to address the Mueller investigation amid McGahn\u2019s recusal, said he didn\u2019t see a similar situation now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any facts yet that\u2019d require recusal,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cI think the White House counsel can be actively involved in this.\u201d\n\nStill, Cobb conceded that his former colleagues shouldn\u2019t be surprised if Congress came knocking for testimony from one or two people in the counsel\u2019s office.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency has indeed involved a revolving cast of lawyers \u2014 both personal and official attorneys representing the businessman-turned-politician. Among the most recognized is Michael Cohen, the longtime Trump Organization lawyer who is serving a three-year prison sentence for his role in a hush-money scheme during the 2016 presidential campaign involving an adult-film actress that also implicated the president. Then there\u2019s Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and current personal lawyer to the president who has spearheaded a controversial media campaign to expose specious claims about the Biden family\u2019s Ukraine ties that has helped create the impeachment storm engulfing the president.\n\nInside the Trump White House counsel\u2019s office, Cipollone retained John Eisenberg, McGahn\u2019s No. 2 for national security issues, and also added three new deputies: Kate Comerford Todd, the former head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s litigation arm, for judicial nominations; Patrick Philbin, a former top George W. Bush Justice Department official, to deal with policy matters; and Mike Purpura, an ex-Bush White House attorney, to spearhead a team of about 20 attorneys tasked with challenging many of the Democratic oversight efforts.\n\nWith the Ukraine scandal, some legal experts have questioned whether the Cipollone-led White House counsel\u2019s office should be playing such a prominent role in an apparent bid to limit the damage for the president.\n\n\u201cCall me old-fashioned, but I really don\u2019t think this is a proper role for a United States government lawyer,\u201d George Conway, a conservative attorney and frequent Trump critic who is married to White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, wrote earlier this week on Twitter.\n\nPhilip Allen Lacovara, a former Watergate prosecutor, recalled how multiple Nixon White House lawyers lost their jobs and went to prison for misusing their government positions to protect the president against political embarrassment.\n\n\u201cThe White House counsel is a government employee whose professional responsibility is owed to the office of the presidency, not to the personal political fortunes of a particular incumbent,\u201d Lacovara said.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s case, Lacovara noted that White House officials had confirmed in the newly disclosed whistleblower complaint that the transcripts of the call between the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents were put on \u201clock down\u201d for political reasons instead of national security ones.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, it was improper for the White House counsel\u2019s office to participate in the scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real prospect of legal jeopardy.\u201d\n\nBut others have thrown out a yellow flag not to jump to conclusions about whether the White House lawyers themselves will be in any trouble \u2014 at least not until more facts are known.\n\n\u201cThey have no jeopardy if they did nothing improper, and I haven\u2019t seen any suggestion that they did so,\u201d Jack Quinn, the former Clinton White House counsel, said in an email.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re only at the beginning of this, of course.\u201d\n\nQuint Forgey contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tom Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/53/0d/d51acb4e4eb8a69d81ab46412819/06122019-patcipollone-900-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
