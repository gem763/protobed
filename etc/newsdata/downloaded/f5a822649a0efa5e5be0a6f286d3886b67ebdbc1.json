We can go away from this tournament with our heads held high.\u201d", "description": "Fiji coach John McKee said the Pacific islanders could leave the Rugby World Cup with their heads held high after showing their quality in a 29-17 defeat by Wales on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438894368&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981KG", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
