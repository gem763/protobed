She believed - just as she had somehow continued to believe through the pain of her very public previous failures - but she refused to succumb to her emotions.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe memories were too raw; the labels still too close. Choker. Bottler. Destined for failure. She could not let it happen again. Not this time. Not with the world title in her grasp.\n\nStep by gentle step she progressed, extending her lead with magnificent run after magnificent jump after magnificent throw until her only real rival, one of the greatest heptathletes in history, tapped out. Nafi Thiam, the Olympic, world and European champion could take it no more.\n\nTroubled by an elbow problem and safe in the knowledge that Johnson-Thompson was untouchable regardless of anything she threw at her, the Belgian donned her tracksuit and walked off midway through the penultimate event. The game was up. With one event still remaining, Johnson-Thompson had all but secured the world title.\n\nStill she gave no hint of what she was feeling. A new target appeared. Within months of appearing on the global stage as a wide-eyed teenager, Johnson-Thompson had been labelled \u201cthe next Jessica Ennis-Hill\u201d. Surely it was unfair to even ask her to compete with Britain\u2019s athletics queen.\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson wins the 800m heptathlon final to clinch gold in Doha Credit: AFP\n\nYet here she was within sight of Ennis-Hill\u2019s incredible national record set when winning Olympic gold at London 2012. In what became an 800m race against the clock, Johnson-Thompson went for it, keeling over after the finish line to hear her final score: 6,981 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetter than Ennis-Hill (by 36 points) and better than Denise Lewis. Having revealed earlier this year that she suffered from imposter syndrome, Johnson-Thompson had proven even herself wrong. She was world champion and she most certainly belonged.\n\nIt is not difficult to see how such deep mental scars emerged. Four years ago, she looked certain to win a first World Championships medal only to crash out when failing to register a legal mark in the long jump. Two years on it was a dreadful high jump that let her down. In between, she finished only sixth at the Olympics.\n\nAn overhaul was required and so she bade farewell to her childhood coach, her home town of Liverpool and her beloved sausage dogs, throwing herself into a new life in Montpellier, France - prepared to sacrifice everything in the quest for glory.\n\nSlowly, her fortunes turned. A world indoor title paved the way for Commonwealth gold and a European silver behind Thiam last year, as the mistakes of her past grew more distant. She seemed - and until this performance in Doha it felt necessary only to whisper it - remarkably consistent. Even then, she could surely never have envisaged anything like this.\n\nDay one had passed more perfectly than any in her athletics career. Personal bests in the 100m hurdles and shot put, combined with a championship best high jump and event-topping 200m, meant she already had a 96-point cushion over Thiam overnight, which only grew.\n\nWith memories of that disaster from Beijing four years ago still fresh, a safe 6.32m opening long jump effort ensured she had points on the board, before she then flew out to 6.77m - her best ever jump during a heptathlon. Thiam could go no further than 6.40m and the gold medal edged ever closer.\n\nIf the Belgian was to somehow deny her, the major swing would have to come in the javelin, an event Johnson-Thompson has long seemed destined never to master. But on a night for fresh storylines, she wrote a new narrative, flinging it 43.93m with the best throw of her life.\n\nHolding a lead of 137 points, victory was already assured before the 800m Credit: Reuters\n\nUnlike at the Rio Olympics, where Thiam threw a personal best despite an elbow injury, this time she had to submit to her body. With heavy strapping on her throwing arm, she managed just 48.04m before surrendering with one attempt remaining.\n\nBut this was no story of Johnson-Thompson taking advantage of a wounded rival. By that point, she had already ground Thiam into submission. Even fully fit, the Belgian would not have won gold.\n\nHolding a lead of 137 points at that stage, victory was already assured before the 800m, which Johnson-Thompson completed in 2min 7.26sec. Some way below her best over the course of the two-day competition, Thiam had to make do with silver in 6,677 points, while Austria\u2019s Verena Preiner scored 6,560 for bronze.\n\nFinally, a smile appeared and then it grew. Who would have thought it? Johnson-Thompson: the woman for the big occasion.\n\nAfter two British gold medals in two days, Laura Muir has faint hopes of completing the hat-trick on Saturday having sealed her place in the 1500m final.\n\nMuir, who had not raced for 10 weeks prior to these World Championships after tearing her calf, dictated proceedings from the front in her semi-final to ensure she crossed the line in third.\n\n\u201cIt went really well and I felt really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I was going to stay out the way for the first half of the race and make sure I was in position for the second half. I did that and I conserved as much energy as I could.\u201d\n\nSifan Hassan, crowned 10,000m champion last weekend, remains gold medal favourite after easing to victory in her semi-final two days after she was forced to find another coach in light of Alberto Salazar\u2019s ban.", "description": "Over the course of one of the finest performances in recent British athletics history, Katarina Johnson-Thompson remained expressionless.
