It's also water-resistant, well-padded, and comes with a detachable shoulder strap in case you want to carry it without a tote bag.\n\nKnowing how long I used my previous case, the $90 price tag is a worthwhile investment for something I know I'll use every day for the next few years.\n\nUpdated 10/15/19: Three months later with daily use, this laptop case still looks brand-new and has even survived several cold brew baths after my travel thermos leaked. The thick neoprene kept my laptop dry and was easy to rinse and hang dry too.\n\nI've always thought of laptop cases as more functional than fashionable, so I bought this one from Amazon within five seconds of seeing more than 1,000 5-star reviews a few years ago. It's something that I need purely to protect my laptop, so I didn't want to waste my last two brain cells thinking about the style or color.\n\nWell, it wasn't until I started testing the new Dagne Dover laptop sleeves that I realized function and fashion could \u2014 and should \u2014 co-exist in something so mundane and practical as a laptop case.\n\nI have the 13-inch Laptop Sleeve in Black, which doesn't come cheap at $89.95. It's definitely a lot more than what I paid for my previous case and what I'd want to pay for a laptop sleeve in general, but the specs, design, and durability sold me.\n\nThe laptop sleeve is durable and water-resistant, it kept my laptop dry even after it took a bath in chicken teriyaki sauce and coffee\n\nLike most other Dagne Dover bags, the laptop sleeve is made with incredibly durable and water-resistant neoprene. I've spilled juice from leftover chicken teriyaki on it, and while there was a puddle at my bottom of my Cuyana tote, my laptop remained dry \u2014 which is great, because the sleeve was holding my work laptop.\n\nI also accidentally drenched it in cold brew after my thermos leaked. I didn't have anywhere to offload the coffee until I got to the office 30 minutes later, but the neoprene fabric was able to keep my laptop dry. Being able to avoid a stern talk with IT is worth the $90 price.\n\nThere's a mesh pocket inside to carry pens or notebooks, with a Velcro closure so nothing falls out.\n\nThe black colorway required no thought on my end, though if I was more stylish, I'd have gone with one of cooler colors like Dune or Dark Moss. The zipper is also the same shade as the sleeve, so the entire look is very monochromatic.\n\nIt's slim at 1.13 inches when zipped and super lightweight at 12.8 ounces\n\nThe 13-inch fit my MacBook Pro perfectly, and the sleeve is only 1.13 inches thick when zipped. It's ever so slightly thicker than my old TomToc, which is 1.10 inches, but the cloth fabric on that one isn't flush against the case itself so it always looks and feels thicker than the stated specs.\n\nThe Dagne Dover sleeve is made with neoprene and is super lightweight at 12.8 ounces. There's no extra decorative fabric that would add more weight or thickness; it remains slim and sleek with or without my laptop inside.\n\nThe slimmer design also means it gives me extra room in my Cuyana tote bag to schlep more things around \u2014 though I don't know if that's a good idea. At least I've been using the Large Arlo Tech Pouch in Storm to organize things more, like charging cables, bandages, and hand sanitizer. I love that it unzips the entire length of the bag so it opens flat and I can see everything instantly. No more digging around the pouch only to poke myself with the tweezer that I never use but think is super important to have.\n\nAnd if I don't want to carry my tote bag around, the Dagne Dover sleeves comes with detachable shoulder straps. I use it when I'm heading to a local coffee shop to do some work or chill, or when I'm trying to force myself to streamline things.\n\nDespite the overall design of the sleeve being really slick, that's not to say it's flimsy \u2014 it's padded really well. In fact, I dropped my laptop a split second after I put it into the case and it made a soft thudding noise when it hit the ground \u2014 no dents, scratches, or bumps that'd indicate what just happened. This was also with my work laptop inside \u2014 sorry.", "description": "I've dropped my laptop and spilled leftovers in my tote bag, but this Dagne Dover sleeve protected my laptop.
