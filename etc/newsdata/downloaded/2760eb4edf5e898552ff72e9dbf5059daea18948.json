The wilderness area is located south of Ocotillo, California. Officials describe the area as being difficult to reach via vehicle.\n\nThe agents interviewed the migrants and narrowed down their location. Dispatched agents and Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) agents initiated a search operation to locate the distressed migrants. About two hours later, the agents located the migrants.\n\nThe BORSTAR agents assessed the migrants\u2019 medical conditioned and found two of the three migrants to be severely dehydrated. They agents initiated emergency medical assistance by starting intravenous fluid treatment. Other agents contacted the Ocotillo Fire Department which dispatched Emergency Medical Services crews to provide additional medical services and transportation to a local hospital.\n\nAgents later arrested all three migrants and transported them to the El Centro Border Patrol station for processing on immigration violations.\n\nOfficials did not disclose the nationality of the three migrants rescued from the mountain region.\n\nSo far this year, at least 336 migrants died while or shortly after illegally crossing the border from Mexico into the United States, according to the International Organization for Migration\u2019s Missing Migrants Project. More than 200 of those died along the Texas border with Mexico.\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2019, Border Patrol agents rescued more than 3,000 migrants whose lives were put in danger by human smugglers, Breitbart Texas reported.
