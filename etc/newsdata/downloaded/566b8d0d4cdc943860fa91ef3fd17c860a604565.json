Johnny Isakson's (R-Ga.) announcement that he will resign later this year due to health problems puts Republicans on defense. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo 2020 Elections Surprise Georgia resignation jolts battle for the Senate Republicans will now be forced to defend two seats in an emerging swing state.\n\nDemocrats' path to a Senate majority after the 2020 elections got a little wider on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson's (R-Ga.) announcement that he will resign later this year due to health problems puts Republicans on defense, with another competitive seat on the ballot in an emerging swing state.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocrats need to flip three states to win back the Senate if they also capture the White House. Only two Republicans are up in states President Donald Trump lost in 2016 \u2014 Colorado and Maine \u2014 meaning Democrats will have to win in red states to control the chamber.\n\nRepublicans now have to defend two seats in Georgia \u2014 which is also likely to be competitive in the presidential race \u2014 increasing the attention and money required to hold their grip on the rapidly shifting state.\n\nDemocrats haven't won a Senate race in Georgia in two decades, and the party had already struggled to recruit top-tier talent to the race after Stacey Abrams passed on running earlier this year. Abrams said Wednesday she won\u2019t run in a special election, either. But new Democrats could consider jumping in to run in the special election, and if the party is able to put the state in play, it gives them a two-for-one opportunity.\n\nNikema Williams, the chair of the state Democratic party, said it has \u201cnever been clearer that the path for Democratic victory runs through Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe are the battleground state, and Georgia Democrats are ready to fight and deliver both the Senate and the presidency for Democrats across the country in 2020,\u201d Williams said.\n\nRepublicans are confident they will be able to hold Isakson\u2019s seat, alongside that of Sen. David Perdue, who is running for a second term. They point out that Abrams lost the 2018 gubernatorial race in a high-turnout contest \u2014 and that Democrats have not attracted top recruits to the first race, let alone to a second.\n\n\u201cDems were having a hard enough time figuring out who they were going to get behind\u201d against Perdue, said John Watson, a former state GOP chairman. \u201cNow they have the double problem of figuring out two races.\u201d\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

John Hickenlooper to drop out of the presidential contest and enter the crowded race to face GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, which Democrats say increased their chances in a must-win state. But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's endorsement of Hickenlooper has infuriated progressives and led to vocal backlash from the other candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, in Arizona, appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally got a primary challenge Wednesday from a wealthy businessman, which could complicate her path against Democrat Mark Kelly, another top party recruit.\n\nRepublicans acknowledge that the pending Georgia vacancy is an unwelcome development, but they argue that it was a state they were already confident they could hold. Some found a silver lining in the effect it would have on the rest of the map.\n\nDan Eberhart, a major Republican donor, said he thinks the special election strengthens Perdue's reelection bid and makes the state that much more expensive for Democrats in a contest that was already an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cThis will ultimately reduce the resources Democrats have in Arizona, Maine, North Carolina and Colorado down the stretch as they strive for two slightly-out-of-reach Senate seats in Georgia,\u201d Eberhart said.\n\nA Republican strategist working on Senate races, however, acknowledged that a second race in Georgia would likely drain the GOP's coffers, as well. \u201cIt\u2019s just another line item in the budget, frankly. That\u2019s the main concern,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nZac McCrary, a veteran Democratic pollster who works on Senate races, said winning an open seat is easier than ousting an incumbent, and said the race would immediately be among the top half-dozen party targets.\n\n\u201cI think it expands the playing field that has been relatively thin so far,\u201d McCrary said. \u201cThis gives Democrats a wider path to retaking the majority.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who will ultimately be in the race on either side. Several Republicans are considered candidates for the appointment after Isakson departs at the end of the year: Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan; state Attorney General Chris Carr; and Reps. Doug Collins and Tom Graves.\n\nOn the Democratic side, operatives listed several potential contenders, including Michelle Nunn, who lost to Perdue in 2014; Jason Carter, who lost the race for governor that year; and Rep. Lucy McBath, who flipped a suburban House district last year.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he would consider running for Senate, Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, said, \"I think anybody would think about it.\"\n\nThree candidates are already running for Senate against Perdue: former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson, Clarkston Mayor Ted Terry and businesswoman Sarah Riggs Amico, who lost the race for lieutenant governor last year and announced her campaign earlier this week. All three confirmed they plan on staying in the race against Perdue.\n\nOne other potential candidate is Jon Ossoff, who lost an expensive and closely watched special election for Congress in the Atlanta suburbs in 2017. Ossof is leaning towards running, according to a person who has spoken with him and was granted anonymity to share private conversations. This week\u2019s developments did not change his timeline but did open up the question of which seat he would run for.\n\nOssoff has already spoken with potential campaign managers and has had discussions with veteran pollster Fred Yang about working for his potential campaign, according to multiple Democrats familiar with the conversations. Yang did not return an email requesting comment.\n\nDemocrats uniformly considered the vacancy a positive for their chances to win back the chamber, pointing to changing political winds in Georgia. While Republicans swept the statewide races in 2018, their winning margins over Democrats were narrow. And Democrats won the Atlanta-area House seat where Ossoff had come up short the year before, another sign of Trump-era GOP weakness in the suburbs.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another seat Republicans will need to defend next year in an increasingly competitive battleground where the president\u2019s approval has plunged by double digits since taking office,\u201d said Stewart Boss, a spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nRepublicans cautioned against handicapping the special election until Gov. Brian Kemp appoints Isakson's replacement early next year, and most Republicans kept their comments focused on Isakson's career Wednesday. Perdue in a statement praised Isakson as a \u201ctrue statesman,\u201d a sentiment other Republican officials echoed.\n\nSen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called Isakson a \u201csteadfast conservative leader\u201d for the state.\n\n\u201cHe will be missed, but we look forward to the men and women of Georgia electing another strong Republican leader in 2020 alongside David Perdue,\u201d Young said.", "description": "Republicans will now be forced to defend two seats in an emerging swing state.", "authors": ["James Arkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/56/fc/1af6d5274ae79585d724d58fcdab/190825-johnny-iaskson-ap-773.jpg"}
