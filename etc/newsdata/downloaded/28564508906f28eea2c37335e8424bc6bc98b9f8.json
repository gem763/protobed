He declined to offer his views of the political situation in China, saying he did not know enough about it to offer an informed opinion.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, I\u2019ve always been welcomed with open arms,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to China probably over 15 to 20 times, and the main reason I\u2019ve always wanted to go back to China is because of the game of basketball. The game of basketball has brought people together in so many different facets, in so many different countries \u2014 people you would never, ever expect.\u201d\n\nAlmost as quickly as his news conference was finished, James was the subject of widespread backlash on social media. Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, was among those who weighed in on Twitter: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see him join the chorus kowtowing to Communist China & putting profits over human rights for #HongKong.\u201d\n\nAbout an hour after his news conference, James began some damage control of his own on Twitter.\n\n\u201cLet me clear up the confusion,\u201d he wrote in one of his posts, referring to his take on Morey\u2019s tweet. \u201cI do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday in Hong Kong, about 100 basketball fans stood on a court in the Wan Chai neighborhood, thanking Daryl Morey for his support at an event they called \u201cStand with Morey.\u201d\n\nNikio Yuen, 24, who was wearing a Celtics Enes Kanter jersey, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in James. \u201cI thought he supported democracy and freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to freedom of speech that affects the business of the league, he doesn\u2019t support it.\u201d\n\nWilliam Mok, 36, drew a comparison to James\u2019 domestic activism. \u201cPlease remember, all N.B.A. players, what you said before,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack lives matter. Hong Kong lives also matter.\u201d\n\nDaniel Victor contributed reporting from Hong Kong.", "description": "The Lakers star said he believed Daryl Morey\u2019s choice to post about protests in Hong Kong could have endangered traveling players.", "authors": ["Scott Cacciola"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/sports/14lebron-lede/14lebron-lede-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
