Some will never support him at all and others might back a deal if it had a confirmatory referendum attached or extra reassurances on workers rights and environmental protections. These are the demands of all the key groups.\n\nConservatives\n\nThe vast bulk of the Conservative party voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal and will be voting for Johnson\u2019s deal, whatever he comes back with. Most of the party now just wants to get Brexit through, making up 260 MPs.\n\nTory \u201cspartans\u201d\n\nThis group of 28 hardline Brexiters hated Theresa May\u2019s deal because the Northern Irish backstop proposal, which contributed to it failing in the House of Commons three times. They may be satisfied with Johnson\u2019s compromise proposal, which involves a form of Northern Ireland-only backstop, and promises of an independent trade policy. However, some still have concerns about Northern Ireland remaining aligned with the EU on customs and it is not clear if all of them could still support a deal if the DUP are not on board. Steve Baker, the chair of the group, said he was optimistic about supporting \u201ctolerable\u201d deal but the group as a whole would be reserving judgement until they had seen the legal text.\n\nThe Tory anti-no-deal rebels\n\nThis group of expelled Tories \u2013 kicked out for trying to block a no-deal Brexit \u2013 numbered 21. Sam Gyimah has since joined the Liberal Democrats, but these ex-Conservatives are mixed on whether they would now back a deal. Most of them will probably back Johnson because it removes the scenario of crashing out of the EU. The former chancellor Phillip Hammond wants a far closer economic relationship than what is being proposed, and the backbencher Antoinette Sandbach would like a second referendum. Another one of the expelled, Margot James, told the BBC she was likely to give a Johnson deal the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d, however she felt his proposed deal was worse than the one proposed by Theresa May.\n\nDemocratic Unionist party\n\nProfile Who are the DUP? Show Hide The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is a Northern Ireland unionist political party, founded by Ian Paisley in 1971. The party is currently led by Arlene Foster. The DUP achieved their best ever general election performance in 2017, and have 10 of Northern Ireland\u2019s 18 constituency MPs at Westminster, where they are led by Nigel Dodds. Since the election they have been supporting Theresa May\u2019s Conservative government in a confidence-and-supply agreement. The DUP supported leave in the EU referendum, and have repeatedly expressed their concerns over the provisions for an Irish border backstop. This led to them voting against Theresa May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in parliament\u2019s three \u2018meaningful votes\u2019. Getting them to back any new Boris Johnson Brexit plan for the island of Ireland is seen as key to him getting parliamentary backing for a deal. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. Devolution and power-sharing in Northern Ireland, where the DUP had held the position of First Minister since 2007, collapsed in January 2017, and has not been restored despite several attempts, most recently in the wake of the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. Martin Belam Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA\n\nThe Northern Irish party is the most important piece of the jigsaw, and the assumption is that if the party\u2019s 10 MPs agree to Johnson\u2019s deal, then Eurosceptics will fall in behind them. Ultimately they want to be able to tell voters in Northern Ireland that it remains part of the UK and will not be cut adrift by Westminster. The significant sticking point now is over how in the future they might give their \u201cconsent\u201d to the deal and their future alignment with EU regulation. They want certainty that they would be able to block continued proximity to EU rules through the Northern Ireland assembly, once it is up and running again.\n\n\ufeffLabour\n\nLabour will never vote for a hard Brexit deal proposed by Johnson and ultimately Jeremy Corbyn wants to broker his own agreement with the EU should he become prime minister. This would have to involve stronger protections for workers rights, the environment, security for EU citizens and a customs union with the EU. However, there could be some pressure from the pro-remain wing of the party to allow a Johnson deal if the government agreed to tack on a confirmatory referendum in order to get it through.\n\nLabour MPs for a deal\n\nWhile the party leadership will not back a Johnson deal, it is a different story for some of the party\u2019s backbenchers in leave voting seats. About 19 Labour MPs are potentially up for voting for a deal \u2013 if there were stronger protections on workers rights, the environment and the future relationship. They might be minded to back a deal from Johnson as it removes the threat of no deal, presents an \u201corderly Brexit\u201d and avoids delay.\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nA second referendum is official policy for this anti-Brexit party and the leader, Jo Swinson, has tabled a motion to get this decision back before MPs via an amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech. She has been fairly warm to suggestions that they could back a Johnson\u2019s deal if it also offered a second vote.\n\nThe Scottish National party\n\nThe party also backs a people\u2019s vote on Brexit but even if this is dangled in front of them by the prime minister, they will not back any kind of deal that takes Scotland out of the customs union and single market. Another Scottish independence referendum is their main priority and since Johnson is almost certainly unlikely to accept that request, or incorporate it into his deal, it is hard to see how they could ever back him. The party also wants a general election urgently and the most likely route to one is if Johnson does not manage to get a deal through parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Parties and factions in House of Commons have their own red lines and demands", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df42c7f59012599f5eb5971941560ea2a29d7671/22_0_1953_1172/master/1953.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9bacf9a54c1c505b396c662908c1c850", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
