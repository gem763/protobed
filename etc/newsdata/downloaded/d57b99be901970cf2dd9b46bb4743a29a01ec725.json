The facilities will need to place a high priority on addressing recommendations relating to general business risk, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said in a statement, following its annual assessment. It has also made a number of other recommendations for the ASX CS facilities, it added. The RBA is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed clearing and settlement facilities, focusing on reduction of systemic risk. It sets standards that these facilities are required to meet.\n\nAustralia's cbank makes recommendations for ASX's clearing & settlement facilities", "description": "Australia's cbank makes recommendations for ASX's clearing & settlement facilities", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB670Y6_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
