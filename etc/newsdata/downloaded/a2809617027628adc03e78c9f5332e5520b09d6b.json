The company investors last night with its news and gathered enough support among investors. Netflix (NASDAQ: ) subscriber growth, according to its latest update, was very much in line with the market\u2019s expectation: 6.77 million subscribers in the third quarter. The growth in this number was dominated from overseas, an area where Netflix is mainly focused on now.\n\nThe critical element is that the firm improved its profit margin. As an investor, what you are concerned about the following: the growth rate, profit margins and an increase in the competitor rate. When it comes to Netflix, competition hasn\u2019t been a significant issue for them because remember during the DVD period, the company easily made its trademark among competitors. Currently, the issue with Netflix isn\u2019t about its subscribers\u2014I strongly disagree\u2014the issue is with their profit margin which is getting squeezed with higher content cost, churn rate\u2014something which company doesn\u2019t report\u2014and the marketing cost. Content is king and for Netflix (NASDAQ: ) to have the right content, it needs to make sure that it has the most important and valuable information about users. Only be knowing what they like can help them to not only make a new successful content but also bring the churn rate down. For this to happen, Netflix needs to flex its R&D lab.\n\nBrexit Derailing? Sterling Is The Best Performer Among G10 Currencies\n\nAs we said a few days ago, traders are really living and breathing every single headline. Further evidence of this statement can be seen by looking at the current Brexit landscape and the \u2019s price action. The currency tumbled as the UK\u2019s prime minister\u2019s political allies refused to support the current framework around the Brexit agreement. The currency is still up more than 3% month-to-date and among G10 currencies, it is the best performer. The euro is the next best performer of the month and in third place.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Naeem Aslam covering: GBP/USD, AUD/USD, Netflix Inc.
