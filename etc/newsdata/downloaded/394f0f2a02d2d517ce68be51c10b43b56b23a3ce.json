To the former, Johnson called for the removal of \u201cvery considerable barriers\u201d barring British goods such as pork pies and U.K. bell peppers from being exported to the U.S. market. To the latter, he warned that the only way to prevent a no-deal Brexit, on which Tusk said he will not cooperate, is to remove the Irish backstop, a provision in the current Brexit deal, negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May, that would maintain an open border on the island of Ireland by keeping Britain closely tied to EU rules and regulations (Johnson has dismissed the backstop as \u201cantidemocratic\u201d).\n\nRead: The clause that makes Brexiteers furious\u2014and why they have a point\n\nThe transatlantic divisions between European leaders and the Trump administration offer a preview of the balancing act that British foreign policy will need to navigate in a post-Brexit world. On Iran, Britain has remained firmly aligned with Germany and France in defense of the 2014 nuclear deal and in opposition of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undermine it through the reimposition of crippling sanctions on the Iranian regime. Still, Britain also announced last month that it would join a U.S.-led mission in the Gulf following the seizure of one of its tankers by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz. Though the British government insisted that the move doesn\u2019t constitute a shift in its position on Iran, Germany and France notably decided not to follow suit, citing opposition to Washington\u2019s strategy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran.\n\nOn trade, Britain is in a similarly difficult position. With just two months left before it leaves the EU and all the trading relationships that membership to the bloc affords, London is desperate to begin striking its own deals\u2014starting with the United States. But a free-trade deal with the U.S. won\u2019t be easy, and Washington is likely to expect any number of concessions from British officials on both the trade and foreign-policy fronts. Without significant leverage at its disposal, Britain is unlikely to be able to negotiate with the U.S. on an equal footing.\n\nTrump has so far taken a shine to Johnson, whom he endorsed to succeed former Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of his state visit to Britain earlier this year. In the days following Johnson\u2019s ascendance, Trump boasted about his British counterpart being called \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump,\u201d and the two have since held several phone calls to discuss issues including Brexit (of which Trump is a vocal supporter) and trade. \u201cHe\u2019s the right man for the job,\u201d Trump said of Johnson in their first meeting since Johnson took over as prime minister.\n\nRead: Inside Donald Trump and Boris Johnson\u2019s special relationship", "description": "The summit has forced the British prime minister to navigate divided priorities: Europe and Trump.", "authors": ["Yasmeen Serhan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTS2NRVQ/facebook.jpg?1566729615"}
