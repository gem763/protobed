It\u2019s more important games and everyone wants to win and taking it serious, so you would be lying if you said no.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn whether he has considered that this may be his last run with the only team he\u2019s ever known, given that he\u2019ll be a free agent this offseason: \u201cYeah, of course. As the human aspect of it, you want to think about your future and you want to wonder what\u2019s going to happen because nothing\u2019s set in stone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nThis was Rendon at his most candid, his most relaxed, and maybe his most publicly expressive since a spring training interview about contract negotiations that were, and remain, entirely stalled. That was in early February. The 29-year-old doesn\u2019t like speaking with reporters much, especially a big group of them. If he could, he would play baseball with no one watching, like he did growing up in Houston, back when the game was just hitting and fielding and having raw fun.\n\nThere are changes that Rendon enjoys. It\u2019s nice to be paid \u2014 and paid a lot \u2014 for something he loves to do. But it\u2019s attention that bothers him, and as an MVP hopeful about to hit the open market, there\u2019s only more coming. Most players would deny that a contract year is nagging at them in any way. Rendon isn\u2019t most players.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s like anything else. It\u2019s a big decision in our life, in my life and my wife and my daughters and my family,\u201d Rendon said after admitting that compartmentalizing between now and what\u2019s next is challenging. \u201cBut you can\u2019t worry about the future. We can only worry about what\u2019s happening right now. And we might have bigger plans for ourselves, but when does that ever come to fruition? If it was up to us every single day, then we would all have a perfect life, but stuff happens, but it\u2019s an imperfect world.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t worry about the future, just try to be the best person we can today.\u201d\n\nSo the short-term view is that Rendon wants to help the Nationals upend the Dodgers. He will be a key component if they do. He finished this season with a league-high 124 RBI, and career-bests with a 34 home runs, a .319 batting average and an on-base-plus slugging percentage of 1.010. He also led the league with 44 doubles. He is the heartbeat of the Nationals\u2019 lineup, its steady pulse, and gets even more critical against left-handed starters such as Clayton Kershaw and Hyun-jin Ryu.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals offered Rendon a seven-year deal in the range of $210 million and $215 million earlier in September, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. That would give him an average annual value of $30 million, the same Washington offered Bryce Harper last autumn, but less than what third baseman Nolan Arenado signed with the Colorado Rockies this past February. Rendon\u2019s representation believes he is more valuable than Arenado, who is a year younger and finished 2019 with 41 home runs, 118 RBI and a .315/.379/.583 slash line. But either way, the Nationals\u2019 proposal seems to set a baseline.\n\nRendon is aware of all this, even if he avoids social media and would rather do a million other things before reading about himself. He has been involved in negotiations from the beginning. He was so productive this season that he shouldn\u2019t have to talk about himself much moving forward. Agent Scott Boras will help, too. Rendon views the constant free agent chatter similarly to how he approaches the MVP race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re yelling at or yelling for. It\u2019s definitely a little crazy,\u201d Rendon said of the regular \u201cM-V-P!\u201d chants at Nationals Park. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m definitely not a fan of the attention. But it\u2019s good to get recognized for, I guess, the hard work that you put in over the years. So it\u2019s definitely humbling and appreciative.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut you do hear them, right?\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d he shot back with a smile. \u201cNo, for sure.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nSvrluga: Stephen Strasburg is the best pitcher in the Nationals-Dodgers series.
