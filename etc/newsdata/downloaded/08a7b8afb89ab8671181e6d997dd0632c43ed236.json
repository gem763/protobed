The deposition was scheduled as part of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Sondland was an intermediary as Trump appealed to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his family. Three House committees are demanding that Sondland appear at a deposition Oct. 16. They are also demanding that he produce documents, including communications from his personal device that have been turned over to the State Department but not to Congress.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, deemed the decision to prevent Sondland from testifying as \u201cstrong evidence of obstruction\u201d by Trump.\n\nIn a statement, Jim McDermott, Sondland\u2019s attorney, explained:\n\nAmbassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena, in order to answer the committee\u2019s questions on an expedited basis. As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the department\u2019s direction.\n\nSondland was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d he was unable to testify Tuesday but is willing to appear on short notice if permitted by the Trump administration, his lawyer added.\n\nThe Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are leading the impeachment probe.\n\nIn a joint statement issued Tuesday, the chairmen of the House panels vowed to subpoena Sondland.\n\n\u201cWe will be issuing subpoena to Ambassador Sondland for both his testimony and documents,\u201d they declared.\n\nA July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky ultimately triggered the impeachment probe. An intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d filed a complaint alleging Trump pressured Zelensky on the phone call to investigate allegations of corruption against Joe Biden and his son.\n\nTrump threatened to withhold aid if Ukraine did not play ball, the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claimed.\n\nSondland has contradicted the quid pro quo claim at the center of the impeachment inquiry. In a text message, the top diplomat clearly said there was \u201cno quid pro quo of any kind\u201d between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nLast week, former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker provided a series of texts to the House committees.\n\nIn written testimony, Volker described the communication exchanges as evidence that the Trump administration did not bully Ukraine into investigating Biden or his son.\n\nHouse Democrats, nevertheless, leaked a \u201csubset\u201d of the texts to fuel their impeachment effort.\n\nThe Democrats used the texts to argue the complete opposite of what Volker testified, saying the communication exchange proves Trump made a quid pro quo offer.\n\nRepublicans are calling on the House Democrats to release the full transcript of Volker\u2019s testimony.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) said making the transcript public would \u201cexonerate\u201d Trump. Meadows witnessed the more than eight hours of testimony provided by Volker.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry proceedings are akin to a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d led by House Democrats who have cherry-picked and mischaracterized evidence, Republican congressmen argued Tuesday.\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that the proceedings fall outside the recognized standards of previous impeachment efforts.\n\nHouse Democrats subpoenaed Sondland on the heels of a White House letter to House Democrats announcing that Trump would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump and members of his administration \u201ccannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d White House Counsel Pat Cipollone declared in the letter.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said he understands the White House decision not to allow Sondland to testify.\n\n\u201cThe reason why the State Department decided not to have Amb. Sondland here today is based on the unfair and partisan process that Mr. Schiff has been running,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe White House letter said the impeachment probe is akin to an effort \u201cseeking to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\u201d", "description": "House Democrat leaders subpoenaed Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, as part of their impeachment investigation.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19281625061631-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
