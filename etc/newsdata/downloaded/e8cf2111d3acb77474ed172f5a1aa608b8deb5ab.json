Today, South Korea has a $1.6 trillion economy \u2013 the fourth largest in Asia after China, Japan and India.\n\nAs South Korea has transformed so too has its population, and very quickly at that, leaving the country in a true population paradox.\n\nIt is undergoing an extreme, rapid example of what demographers call the \u2018demographic transition\u2019, a period of population swell, decline and eventual stabilisation that occurs as countries get richer. For South Korea, this means both a large, rapidly ageing population as well as a low marriage and birth rate that doesn\u2019t adequately replace the dying generations \u2013 quite a conundrum for the future of the nation.\n\nShrinking families", "description": "With a rapidly ageing population, low birth rates and young people who are increasingly shunning marriage, South Korea is in a population conundrum.", "authors": ["Miriam Quick", "Research", "Valentina D'Efilippo", "Illustrations"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7q/qg/p07qqgrr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
