One of them would be dead by noon.\n\nThe war has again found its way back into the political discourse. President Trump invited the Taliban to Camp David, then canceled the invitation after an attack that killed an American soldier. The peace talks are off, but the pressure to bring American troops home seems to be building, even without a deal. Mr. Trump and his aides, and the Democratic presidential candidates, seem to be saying that the war was only about routing Al Qaeda after the Sept. 11 attacks, though Al Qaeda was protected then by the Taliban, who have been fighting us on the ground ever since.\n\n[An American Special Forces soldier was killed in eastern Afghanistan on Monday. The soldier is the 17th American service member to die during combat operations this year.]\n\nThose first few hours in Marja, we felt like we\u2019d won some sort of lottery, like we\u2019d get our shot at a version of Falluja, the brutal Marine battle in Iraq, or Hue in Vietnam.

We were fighting the Taliban to let Afghanistan build a democracy. Or something like that.
