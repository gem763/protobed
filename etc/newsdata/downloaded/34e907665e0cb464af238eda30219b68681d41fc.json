(A previous game was inspired by France, which is the only other time a Pok\u00e9mon Center has come to Europe.)\n\nAs well as selling exclusive items that cannot be had anywhere else there\u2019s also an upstairs area where you can get a demo of the new games. Although they only have set times and you will have to queue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile you wait though, you\u2019ll find that there are increased appearances of Psyduck, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Combee, and other pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon GO, so don\u2019t forget your phone.\n\nIt may be in London but they\u2019ve still spelt centre wrong\n\nWhen is the Pok\u00e9mon Center London store open?\n\nThe store opened on Friday, 18 October and will close forever on Friday, 15 November. That\u2019s the day that Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield comes out, so presumably the idea is that at that point everyone will be too busy playing to shop.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Center is located at Westfield London in Shepard\u2019s Bush, whose opening hours are 10am to 10pm, Monday to Saturday, and 12pm to 6pm on Sunday. So plenty of time to pop in after work if you want some Pok\u00e9mon-flavoured merchandise or early Christmas presents.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what we did the evening before it opened, at a special preview event filled mostly with YouTubers and other fans desperate to spend their money. Curiously, there are very few items directly related to Shield and Sword, but there are plush versions of the starter pok\u00e9mon Sobble, Grookey, and Scorbunny.\n\nGotta buy \u2019em all?\n\nArguably the most appealing merch is that relating to the special Pikachu mascot for the store, who wears a suit and a bowler hat and has a Psyduck umbrella. He\u2019s super cute and the plush version, that goes for \u00a320, is probably the hottest item at the store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(To ensure full disclosure we did get given one for free, and a box of trading cards, but we also bought one ourselves, for a friend.)\n\nLots of the other items have London Pikachu on them though, ranging from socks to mugs to a canvas bag. There were a few other things related to Sword and Shield though, including three different hoodies themed on one each out of Sobble, Grookey, and Scorbunny.\n\nThe most expensive item though was a giant plush (non-London) Pikachu that one YouTuber bought for a whopping \u00a3240, although there didn\u2019t seem to be many of those so it may be sold out by the time you get there.\n\nThat\u2019s not a joke either, as apparently the French pop-up store sold out of all its merchandise within five days, and that was at a time when Pok\u00e9mon fever wasn\u2019t even as pronounced as it is now\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to have been very good this Christmas to get this\n\nThe hoodies are \u00a355 and limited to one per person\n\nWeirdly we didn\u2019t notice the yellow lighting at the time\n\nNothing says London better than a Pikachu branded brolly\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield hands-on preview \u2013 gigantic fun\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Gigantamax Pikachu, Meowth, Eevee, Butterfree, and Charizard officially revealed for Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Go Halloween event has costumed Pikachu, Squirtle, and more", "description": "A pop-up store dedicated solely to Pok\u00e9mon merchandise has opened in West London and it has its own bowler hat-wearing Pikachu merch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/London-City-Pikachu-Plushie-9723_1571392924.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
