His South Carolina firewall shows signs of cracking and he's losing his once-overwhelming lead in Florida, according to a raft of recent polling.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBiden\u2019s descent has been months in the making, the result of continuous fire from progressives, questions about his age and stamina, a drumbeat of negative coverage over lackluster debate performances and frequent misstatements, according to pollsters and party insiders. They also point to a campaign message that at times over-emphasized attacking President Trump and his claim to be the \u201cmost electable\u201d Democrat in the field.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest factor has been the rise of Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has served up a steady diet of grassroots outreach and in-depth policy proposals that have endeared her to progressives.\n\n\u201cBiden has a challenger now. He didn\u2019t have one before,\u201d said Ryan Tyson, a Florida-based pollster who shared three large surveys he just completed in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida that show Biden slipping and Warren gaining.\n\nWhile national polls have shown less movement in the race, the state-based surveys provide a more useful indication of the trajectory of the primary.\n\n\u201cIf you see Warren winning in Iowa and New Hampshire back to back, whoa! Geez! Biden starts losing his argument about electability,\u201d Tyson, who typically surveys for Republicans, said. \u201cCan Biden hang on to South Carolina if he loses in the other early states? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president continues to lead most national polls. He\u2019s run ahead of Trump in general election match-ups in every major poll conducted this year. But the downward trend in Biden\u2019s primary election top-line numbers and favorability ratings \u2014 which began long before reports surfaced recently detailing how President Donald Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate old business ties involving the former vice president\u2019s son -- suggests several bruising months have taken a toll.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s support was always soft. That\u2019s the key,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \u201cUnlike some of the other candidates, Biden\u2019s support isn\u2019t as locked in. He doesn\u2019t have that \u2018it\u2019 factor.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign, which has bristled both at media coverage of the candidate and the attention paid to polls, would not comment for this article.\n\nWith more than four months until Iowa\u2019s Feb. 3 caucus, there is plenty of time for the dynamics of the race to change. But there\u2019s also cause for some alarm for Biden. In New Hampshire, Tyson\u2019s just-completed 600-likely voter poll shows Warren with 18 percent of the vote and Biden 15 percent in an open-ended ballot question. It\u2019s a dramatic change from his last poll, with Biden dropping 18 points while Warren gained 7 \u2014 a 25-point shift.\n\nWhile the methodologies differ slightly, those New Hampshire numbers resemble a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday, which had Warren leading Biden by 2 points in a survey of 401 voters.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing in our poll that people are saying Warren is electable. She\u2019s pragmatic,\u201d said Murray. \u201cI heard that when I talked to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, and we\u2019re seeing that in polls now.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, since May Biden has dropped by another 18 points in South Carolina, though he still remains in first place there with 19 percent of the vote, according to Tyson\u2019s 600-voter poll.\n\nTyson\u2019s polls were conducted for a political nonprofit, Let\u2019s Preserve the American Dream. It does not disclose its donors and has links to Florida business interests, but Tyson says it has also worked with Democratic-leaning as well as conservative groups.\n\nWarren, who has spent relatively little time and money in South Carolina, has gained just a point since May and has 9 percent support in the poll. But she\u2019s now in second because Bernie Sanders has tumbled there as he has in New Hampshire and Iowa.\n\nBiden\u2019s level of support in South Carolina makes it his firewall state, but even in South Carolina there are troubling signs of erosion. While he remains on top, among black voters, who are more than 60 percent of the Democratic electorate, Biden has plummeted 19 points in Tyson\u2019s polls. That\u2019s a potential leading indicator of the problems he could face after South Carolina\u2019s Feb. 29 primary when many of the minority-heavy Southeastern states \u2014 as well as Texas and California \u2014 beginning voting on Super Tuesday, March 3, and thereafter.\n\nFlorida, where about 28 percent of the Democratic primary electorate is black, votes March 17. Biden is in first there with 24 percent of the Democratic vote, losing 15 points since May in Tyson\u2019s polls. Warren moved into second with 11 percent, a 6-point increase while Sanders is in third with 5 percent, an 11-point loss since before the first candidate debate.\n\nThe percentage of Democratic voters who were undecided also shot up by double-digits in polls of the state.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Pollster J. Ann Selzer\u2019s highly regarded survey of caucus-goers showed Warren was benefiting from an enthusiasm gap \u2014 32 percent said they\u2019re \"extremely enthusiastic\" about caucusing for the Massachusetts senator, compared to 22 percent those who support the former vice president.\n\nSelzer said that Warren\u2019s \u201cfootprint\u201d of voters \u2014 the percentage of people saying she\u2019s a second choice or that they would consider caucusing for her \u2014 is bigger than Biden\u2019s by 10 points.\n\nOverall, Warren has 22 percent support to Biden\u2019s 20 percent \u2014 a net 11-point shift in Warren\u2019s favor since the last Selzer poll for the Des Moines Register in June.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s favorability dropped, his unfavorable numbers doubled. In the absence of any context, it\u2019s not bad. But Elizabeth Warren\u2019s numbers are strikingly good,\u201d Selzer said.\n\nSelzer noted that Biden is \u201cstill a force\u201d and that the poll she took was \u201cworse for Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nCompared to the other early states, there\u2019s a dearth in polling in third-in-the-nation Nevada. A survey released Tuesday from USA Today/Suffolk University showed Biden hanging on to a 23-19 percent lead over Warren, whose campaign in the state has earned high marks earned high marks from Democrats.\n\nNationally, Biden\u2019s top-line numbers haven\u2019t fallen as dramatically as in the early states. But pollster Peter Hart said his last national survey for the Wall Street Journal and NBC showed signs of weakness. In April, when Biden first officially entered the race, 32 percent said they were enthusiastic about backing him. In the last poll, 23 percent said that of Biden.\n\nHart said Biden could experience a rallying effect in recent days from Democrats, who are moving forward with impeachment plans over Trump's alleged threat to cut off U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless officials there launched an investigation into Biden and his son.\n\nBut beyond talking about Trump, Hart said, he hasn\u2019t heard Biden emphasize policy the way Warren and others have. And that could leave voters wanting more.\n\n\u201cInstead of controlling the race, the race is controlling him,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThe hardest thing to do is be a front-runner without an agenda when compared to the candidates to the left of him who are presenting bold plans that galvanize people where they say, \u2018I want to be with Joe Biden.\u2019\u201d\n\n", "description": "Recent surveys show the former veep\u2019s leads have vanished in Iowa and New Hampshire, while his South Carolina firewall shows signs of cracking.", "authors": ["Marc Caputo"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/15/5b856f4a41f0b2fd2e1873cb5659/190924-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
