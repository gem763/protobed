Waugh describes those states as or \u201cTrump country.\u201d\n\nNew car registrations, a measure of local consumer spending and confidence, have slowed or declined in so-called red states and are most exposed to China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs, Waugh found in the study distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Those states include Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have 64 electoral votes between them.\n\nSee also: Trump\u2019s Mexico tariffs could drain jobs from America\u2019s economy\n\nRed states appear to be more vulnerable to economic upheaval resulting from the prolonged trade war with China. Earlier this year, Experian ranked 2018 credit scores by state: Massachusetts, Minnesota, Vermont, New Hampshire, South Dakota came out on top with scores of 703 or more. Hillary Clinton won all those states except South Dakota in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum: Nevada, Georgia, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana ranked lowest with scores of 659 or lower. Clinton took Nevada, but the other four states were won by Donald Trump in 2016. Analysts typically say that the higher the ratio of your debt to your credit limit, the more that will adversely effect your credit score.\n\nWaugh\u2019s study tracked data until January, so it missed the latest tariffs. The typical U.S. household will pay $831 more a year due to rising tariffs, a May 2019 New York Federal Reserve Bank study found. The tariffs amount to a tax hike of $86 billion, and will cost about 194,000 jobs, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a low-tax, free-market Washington, D.C.-based think tank.\n\nFurther tariffs threatened by the administration, and retaliatory tariffs by China, the EU and others could end up costing Americans about $233 billion in a year in extra taxes and lost exports, it adds. Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania (all won by Trump in 2016) are major manufacturing states, Matt McAlvanah, a spokesman for trade group Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, said last month.", "description": "New study finds tariffs are taking their toll in battleground Midwestern states.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS930_forgot_MG_20191009092218.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
