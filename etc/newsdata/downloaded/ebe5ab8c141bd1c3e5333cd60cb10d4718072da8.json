Testament to Jamie Carragher for apologising, eight years after the incident.\n\n'I was there on the pitch. At the end of the day, it's bigger than Jamie Carragher - it's the club.\n\n'Liverpool let themselves down that day, wearing t-shirts in support of someone who's been accused of a racist comment.\n\n'Yep, eight years on and still the apology hasn't come from Liverpool in that sense.'\n\nThe whole Liverpool squad wore the shirts in the warm-up at Wigan in December 2011\n\nCarragher, who was Liverpool vice-captain at the time and in the squad, admitted on Monday: 'We made a massive mistake, that was obvious.\n\n'As a family, football club, your first reaction is to support them and that's wrong.\n\n'I'm not condoning Suarez, it was wrong, for clubs that is the first reaction. And we got it wrong, apologies.'\n\nThe Uruguayan then failed to shake his opponent's hand in the return match at Old Trafford later in the season.\n\nEvra admitted on Monday that education is required, instead of necessarily a ban \u2013 Ferdinand agreed with the sentiment that education is the answer.\n\n'I just think the game's moved on from then in terms of the narrative now,' said Ferdinand.\n\nPatrice Evra spoke candidly on Monday Night Football about the incident in the 2011-12 season\n\nUruguayan Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Evra at Anfield on October 15, 2011\n\n'Everything on the edge of everyone's tongue at the moment is racism.\n\n'At that point then it wasn't so people were kind of startled into like \"what do we do, what do we do\". Even more so now \u2013 we're still sitting here saying \"what do we do?\"\n\n'It's not a t-shirt which is going to change it, it's not a day in the season which is going to change it, it's education definitely.'", "description": "Rio Ferdinand, who was on the pitch in October 2011 when Luis Suarez abused Patrice Evra, hit out at the length of time it has taken for any apology to come from those associated with Liverpool.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/20/20052262-0-image-a-12_1571773394457.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
