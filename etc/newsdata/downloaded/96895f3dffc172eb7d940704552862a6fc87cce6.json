I'm serious. I've tried it'", "language": "en", "text": "As she says goodbye to Shelly, the messy matriarch in Transparent, the star talks about nutty grandmas, missing her husband and cat \u2013 and her \u2018sorrow\u2019 over Jeffrey Tambor\n\n\u2018I think we have thousands of people inside of us,\u201d says Judith Light. It\u2019s a midsummer afternoon and Light \u2013 blond, patrician, beautifully manicured\u2013 is sipping a scarlet iced tea in a swanky midtown New York hotel. In a navy blazer and slim trousers, she looks too elegant to contain multitudes.\n\nBut Light is an actress of surprising versatility and astonishing skill. After conservatory training and a stint in repertory theatre, she became a soap star on One Life to Live and a sitcom star on Who\u2019s the Boss? Two decades later, she won back-to-back Tony awards and a special Tony award earlier this year for her activism in support of the LGBTQ community and HIV/Aids programmes.\n\nIn the past dozen years, she has earned four Emmy nominations for series as dizzyingly varied as Ugly Betty, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story and Transparent. A longtime manager spent years telling her: \u201cYou need to let people know what else you do. They don\u2019t know what else you can do.\u201d Now they know.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I wish I could talk about it\u2019 \u2026 Light, right, with Jeffrey Tambor in Transparent.

She has one movie, Before You Know It, out in theatres now, and has been filming a miniseries, flying back and forth to Pittsburgh. There\u2019s also a new series for Amazon, which must remain a secret, and a fresh producing partnership, involving a script from her husband, the writer and actor Robert Desiderio. She would like to do more theatre, but she doesn\u2019t know when she\u2019ll have the time.\n\nLight is a graceful and animated conversationalist, who sometimes calls you \u201cdarling\u201d and occasionally quotes Hugo and Kierkegaard and Eleanor Roosevelt. Her face, lightly made up, is beautiful and expressive. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people that Botox doesn\u2019t work on,\u201d she says. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m serious. I tried it.\u201d\n\nBack when the series began, Transparent\u2019s creator Jill Soloway hadn\u2019t thought of Light as a Shelly type; she didn\u2019t know what she could do. \u201cI was like, \u2018No, Shelly is Jewish. Judith Light isn\u2019t Jewish. She\u2019s like a blond shiksa goyishe goddess,\u201d Soloway recalls. But Light is Jewish. In fact, a casting director once told her she looked so Jewish, she would never work in the soaps. Light and Soloway had a Skype session and spoke mostly about their work on behalf of LGBTQ communities. Light got the part.\n\nTransparent has afforded Light her latest renaissance, allowed her to flourish another of those thousands of people. She doesn\u2019t want to think of the musical, which has just started streaming, as an ending. \u201cI would call it a transition,\u201d she says. I check with Soloway, who identifies as non-binary and prefers a collective pronoun. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it the finale,\u201d they say. \u201cThe name of it is the Transparent: Musicale Finale. It has the world finale in the title.\u201d (Still Soloway hopes it might have another life. Maybe on Broadway.)\n\nFor four seasons, Transparent, which won a slew of Emmys and Golden Globes, centred on Jeffrey Tambor\u2019s Maura. Born Mort, the character had married Light\u2019s Shelly and fathered three children before revealing her gender identity and beginning her transition. Considered groundbreaking for its portrayal of the trans community and its championing of transgender actors and writers, Transparent made other, stickier headlines when an actress on the show and a former assistant both accused Tambor of sexual harassment. Tambor\u2019s option was not renewed. He denies the allegations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to talk about,\u201d Light says, when asked about making the finale without Tambor\u2019s Maura. \u201cThere is still sorrow. And there is difficulty. And it\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s hard to talk about,\u201d she says. I ask about her work with Tambor, whose performance she had praised before the allegations surfaced. \u201cIt really is difficult to talk about,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m \u2013 I wish I could, I wish I could, I just \u2013 I hope you understand.\u201d And when Light looks at you \u2013 with her radiance, with the full force of her attention \u2013 yes, you understand. Or at least you stop asking.\n\nMaura\u2019s absence, courtesy of a convenient aortic aneurysm, meant that some else has to step into the spotlight. That someone is Light\u2019s Shelly, a needy, meddling, achingly vulnerable Jewish mother, part of what Soloway calls \u201ca forgotten generation of women who always feel like they\u2019re waiting for their turn\u201d. In the finale, Shelly takes it, which means that Light sings, she dances, she laughs, she cries, she gyrates in a flesh-coloured leotard and belts lyrics about shoving her grown children back into her vagina. And she inaugurates, to quote one of Faith Soloway\u2019s envelope-pushing lyrics, \u201ca joyocaust / For all the lives we\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018So flexible\u2019 \u2026 Light in Ugly Betty.

She speaks of the Transparent musical as \u201ca glorious creation\u201d, praising her co-workers and somehow minimising her own efforts. Soloway isn\u2019t so reticent. \u201cShe killed it,\u201d Soloway says. \u201cShe\u2019s like dancing her ass off and never tired. She never needed a break. We were just like, \u2018What is she on?\u2019 Can I please be that way when I\u2019m 70? So flexible, so funny, so sexy.\u201d\n\nLight believes that actors are \u201cinvestigative reporters, psychological investigative reporters\u201d, and that acting is a service profession. She will sometimes conduct research into times, places, circumstances, accents. Shelly didn\u2019t require much. Rather, the part meant giving voice and making space for a character she calls \u201cso messy, and so all over the place, like an octopus with flailing arms\u201d, and layering in the fragility and the vulnerability beneath all that flailing. Light felt for Shelly and allowed an audience to feel for her, too. \u201cThat\u2019s the greatest gift that an artist can give,\u201d she says.\n\nEarly in her career, she made more ego-driven choices, she says. \u201cIt was about me, about what was I gonna get?\u201d she says. There\u2019s nothing to get in life, there\u2019s only what you give.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mean it in a saintly way, she says. That\u2019s just how it is. \u201cIt\u2019s like, give it all away! Give!\u201d\n\nHer activism, which she began in the 80s after filming a TV movie about Ryan White, an early Aids victim, is another kind of giving. Does she see a relationship between her advocacy and her acting? Light says that she doesn\u2019t, at least not a conscious one. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it,\u201d she says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sitcom star \u2026 Light with Tony Danza in 80s sitcom Who\u2019s the Boss? Photograph: Craig Sjodin/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images\n\nBut her activism is based on the idea, as Light explains, that \u201cwe\u2019re all of one family, we\u2019re all human beings, we all can relate to each other in a way that is respectful and compassionate and honouring someone\u2019s choice of who they know they are.\u201d And she now chooses her acting projects with an eye to which roles might make a difference, spark conversation, sound an alarm, help us to see each other and our world more clearly and more kindly. Which are different, but not dissimilar ways of incarnating a better, kinder world and more authentic relationships.\n\nThese days, her authenticity involves mostly living in New York while her husband mostly lives in Los Angeles, though they visit each other often. It\u2019s an arrangement they began while Light was filming Ugly Betty, and she is happy to proselytise. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d she says. It\u2019s vital. It\u2019s independent, it is not co-dependent. We both love our alone time. Not everybody can do this, because you have to love your alone time, you really do.\u201d Even the cat, who lives in Los Angeles, seems to understand.\n\nAt the beginning of her career, when she thought that taking a soap opera would demean her, when she thought that sitcoms weren\u2019t where serious actors belonged, she didn\u2019t imagine that at 70 she would be offered a life and an art that was so rich. That owes in part to an industry that is changing, however slowly, and now sees women over 40 as more than, as Light says, \u201cthe nutty grandma, or the kooky sister-in-law, or the bitchy head of the agency who had two episodes. It is not like that any more.\u201d It also owes to women like Light and her peers insisting they are just as interesting and deserving of attention as anyone else.\n\nJust before she leaves, Light quotes Helen Keller: \u201c\u2018Life is either a daring adventure or it\u2019s nothing.\u2019 That\u2019s the way I hold my life,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd within that is tremendous freedom. Doesn\u2019t mean that fear doesn\u2019t come up, doesn\u2019t mean that all things work out the way you think you want them to. But it surely is a journey, an adventure, an aliveness that I would ever have expected.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Transparent: Musicale Finale is on Amazon Prime now.", "description": "As she says goodbye to Shelly, the messy matriarch in Transparent, the star talks about nutty grandmas, missing her husband and cat \u2013 and her \u2018sorrow\u2019 over Jeffrey Tambor", "authors": ["Alexis Soloski"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a9c49dafab46f4077ab056f829602f2cb22065/1101_242_3665_2199/master/3665.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3c75b400276e74a254c9b70c7e0159b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
