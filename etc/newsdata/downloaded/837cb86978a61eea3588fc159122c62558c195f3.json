Mr Leland, a porcelain manufacturer based in Portugal, has since died.\n\nAndrew Gilbert, his heir, believes his family is entitled to the quarter-share and has what he says is the 1964 document of sale.", "description": "A British couple are fighting to be recognised as the co-owners of a painting believed by some to be an early version of the Mona Lisa.", "authors": ["Anita Singh", "Allister Heath", "Fraser Nelson", "Jacob Rees-Mogg", "Madeline Grant", "Iain Duncan Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000213283045-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZavxgBVD_I8nuYCoxkvuzFAANwKXMKr5J4U_ejBUuV8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
