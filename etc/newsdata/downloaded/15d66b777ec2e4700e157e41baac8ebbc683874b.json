A transcript of the phone conversation showed Trump asked Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe US president\u2019s request that Zelensky probe the activities of Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter has sparked an impeachment probe in the US, with the Democrats looking into whether Trump used a delayed aid package as leverage.\n\nTrump wanted Kiev to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukrainian gas firm Burisma.\n\n\u201cThe story with Burisma has nothing to do with weapons,\u201d Zelensky told the press conference, held in a Kiev food court.\n\nThe sole aim of the phone call, he said, was to plan a meeting with Trump.\n\nHe added that there were no \u201cconditions\u201d from the US side to set up the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to establish relations,\u201d he said.\n\nText messages released by Democrats show Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s former US special envoy to Ukraine, telling a top Zelensky aide that he should open an investigation in return for a visit to Washington.\n\nOpponents of Trump say the president used promised financial aid as leverage over the Ukrainian leader in a bid to pressure him into launching an investigation into Biden.\n\nFollowing the phone call, Zelensky said his defence minister told him \u201cthere is a problem, the money has been blocked.\u201d\n\nBut he said the issue was not discussed in the phone call with Trump.\n\nZelensky said the phone call will not affect relations between Washington and Kiev.\n\nTrump alleges that Joe Biden tried to block a Ukraine corruption probe into his son\u2019s business partner, a Ukraine gas tycoon.\n\nBurisma says it is the largest private producer of natural gas and one of Ukraine\u2019s leading gas groups.", "description": "Kiev (AFP) \u2013 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied Thursday that Donald Trump tried to blackmail him by withholding military aid to Kiev in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/6898e1_zelensky-sole-aim-phone-was-plan-meeting-trump-ukraine-zelensky-denies-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
