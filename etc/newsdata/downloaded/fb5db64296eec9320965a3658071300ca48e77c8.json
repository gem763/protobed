REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, was unable to say whether the operation against Baghdadi was successful.\n\nNewsweek said it had been told by a U.S. Army official briefed on the raid that Baghdadi was dead. It said the operation took place in Syria\u2019s northwestern Idlib province, and was carried out by special operations forces after receiving actionable intelligence.\n\nThe official, speaking to Reuters, did not disclose details of the operation and other U.S. officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley announced late on Saturday that Trump would make a \u201cmajor statement\u201d at 9 a.m. EST (1300 GMT) on Sunday.\n\nGidley gave no further details as to the topic of Trump\u2019s statement.\n\nThe president gave an indication that something was afoot earlier on Saturday night when he tweeted without explanation, \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d\n\nTrump has been frustrated by the U.S. news media\u2019s heavy focus on the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, which he calls an illegitimate witch hunt.\n\nHe has also faced withering criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike for his U.S. troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nMany critics of Trump\u2019s Syria pullout have expressed worries that it would lead the Islamic State militancy to regain strength and pose a threat to U.S. interests. An announcement about Baghdadi\u2019s death could help blunt those concerns.\n\nTrump was expected to make the statement in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, which he has used to make a number of major announcements.\n\nJust last week he used the same room to announce that a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds had taken hold.\n\nFor days, U.S. officials had feared that Islamic State would seek to capitalize on the upheaval in Syria. But they also saw a potential opportunity, in which Islamic State leaders might break from more secretive routines to communicate with operatives, potentially creating a chance for the United States and its allies to detect them.\n\nBaghdadi was long thought to hiding somewhere along the Iraq-Syria border. He has led the group since 2010, when it was still an underground al Qaeda offshoot in Iraq.\n\nOn Sept. 16, Islamic State\u2019s media network issued a 30-minute audio message purporting to come from Baghdadi, in which he said operations were taking place daily and called on supporters to free women jailed in camps in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to his group.\n\nIn the audio message, Baghdadi also said the United States and its proxies had been defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the United States had been \u201cdragged\u201d into Mali and Niger.\n\nAt the height of its power Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.\n\nBut the fall in 2017 of Mosul and Raqqa, its strongholds in Iraq and Syria respectively, stripped Baghdadi, an Iraqi, of the trappings of a caliph and turned him into a fugitive thought to be moving along the desert border between Iraq and Syria.\n\nU.S. air strikes killed most of his top lieutenants, and before Islamic State published a video message of Baghdadi in April there had been conflicting reports over whether he was alive.\n\nDespite losing its last significant territory, Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria\u2019s desert and Iraq\u2019s cities.", "description": "The U.S. military conducted an operation against elusive Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Saturday, a U.S. official said, as U.S. President Donald Trump prepared to make a \"major statement\" at the White House on Sunday morning.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445397073&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q05S", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
