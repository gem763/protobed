The last of its kind in Montmartre.\n\nFormerly known as the Cabaret of Assassins (more on that later) the snug, dimly lit interior comprises just two rooms, and is filled with heavy wooden tables and matching benches. A jumble of posters, oil paintings, copper pots, and other bric-a-brac lines the walls, and the light that filters through the red canvas lampshades is the sort of murky crimson that evokes a 19th-century bordello.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

Edith Piaf performed here in the late 1930s before she became a celebrity, and rumor has it that Utrillo was so attached to the place that he requested to be buried right next to it in the adjacent Cimeti\u00e8re Saint-Vincent.\n\nIn her book, In Montmartre: Picasso, Matisse and Modernism in Paris 1900-1910, British author Sue Roe describes the two-room cottage as part bohemian watering hole for down-at-the-heel creatives and part neighborhood pillar, where \u201ceveryone went to be seen.\u201d\n\nIn the early 20th century, according to Roe, \u201cthe Lapin Agile soon became the center of the community in haute Montmartre.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe place,\u201d she writes, \u201cwhere artists gathered with artists manqu\u00e9s, the jobless bourgeois, or the black sheep of the family, the place where the local scoundrel became an autodidact. Dancers who had seen better days came up from the Moulin Rouge to sell opium\u2026 Most people, including Picasso, carried guns.\u201d\n\nLong before a pistol-packing Picasso set foot in the place, however, the tiny cottage on the hill had several incarnations. According to Roe, the building dates back to the reign of Henry IV when it was used as a hunting lodge. In the 18th century, it became a country tavern and gangster haunt called Ma Campagne, before being acquired in the 19th century by a retired can-can dancer.\n\nThe cabaret officially opened in 1860 under the name Rendezvous des Voleurs (Thieves\u2019 Den), but was renamed Cabaret des Assassins in the late 1800s in reference to the images of infamous murderers that adorned the walls. One unsubstantiated rumor claims that the then-owner\u2019s son was indeed killed there by a group of bandits, hence the macabre moniker.\n\nIt was the illustrator Andr\u00e9 Gill who unwittingly gave the cabaret its current name when he painted a sign for the joint in 1875 that depicted a rabbit leaping out of a frying pan. Regulars began referring to the cabaret as \u201cLe Lapin \u00e0 Gill\u201d (Gill\u2019s Rabbit). Over time, the name morphed into \u201cLapin Agile\u201d (Nimble Rabbit). Its new proprietor, the eccentric Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric G\u00e9rard (known simply as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9) put the cabaret on the map as a bohemian Montmartrois hotspot in the early 1900s when Picasso became a regular. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9, who could be spotted strolling in the neighborhood with his pet donkey Lolo, often allowed patrons to pay for their drinks with paintings or poems.\n\nAlthough the cobblestone lanes around the cabaret and the petite vineyard next door still resemble a French country village, Montmartre has changed dramatically over the last century. Forget opium dealers and irascible, gun-toting artists, the biggest danger you\u2019re likely to encounter these days in haute Montmartre is a gaggle of tipsy, privileged teenagers blasting bad pop music, or maybe the odd, mildly aggressive Pekinese at the end of a leash.\n\nMulti-million euro villas have replaced the artists\u2019 squats of Picasso\u2019s day, and housing costs have shot up over the past several decades. Most of the artists have long since moved out, and many small business owners can\u2019t stay afloat in the current housing market either.\n\n\u201cWhen we arrived here 30 years ago, there was still a delicatessen, a baker, a tobacco shop, a haberdashery,\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Loup, a Montmartre pharmacist, told Agence France Presse. \u201cThe problem is that rents have skyrocketed. Like real estate throughout Paris, land prices have exploded.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a quick perusal through local real estate rags reveals 60-square-meter (about 646 square feet) apartments fetching close to \u20ac900,000 ($1 million), while fixer-uppers at the less-chic bottom of the butte go for well over \u20ac1 million. Rental prices aren\u2019t much better. For instance, a 40-square-meter (430 square feet) loft studio with a view of the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur will set you back \u20ac1,861 ($2,072) a month. Not exactly in the realm of possibility for starving artist sorts.\n\n\u201c \u201cThe five performers sang beautifully, but they were all over 60 years old and I felt like it was in the 1800s.\u201d \u201d\n\nThe City of Light\u2019s formerly-ramshackle northern suburb is also feeling the weight of mass tourism. I partially (and perhaps unfairly) blame the tourist influx on Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s whimsical 2001 film Am\u00e9lie, which became an international sensation and sparked a renewed interest in the neighborhood.\n\nToday, some 12 million annual visitors traipse through Montmartre\u2019s warren of winding streets, admire the cake-like, white cupola of the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur basilica (which locals affectionately refer to as \u201cthe meringue\u201d), and pose for selfies in front of La Maison Rose\u2014a photogenic, pastel pink eatery just steps from the Lapin Agile that was once the subject of one of Utrillo\u2019s works. The Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins, where Jeunet\u2019s peppy heroine, Am\u00e9lie Poulain, worked as a server is still a popular stop on the Montmartre tourist circuit.\n\nNowhere is this tsunami of visitors more apparent than at the Place du Tertre, the cobbled square near the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, where sketch artists compete for tourist dollars with cheap souvenir shops and bistros of questionable quality that cater primarily to foreign tourists. Ironically, several of the art stores selling low-cost renditions of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur feature wares that were not produced in the neighborhood, or even in France, but in China.\n\nIn the summer months, the crowds around the square are claustrophobically thick, and the only time I venture there, if at all, is early on weekend mornings when the streets are fairly empty. Bohemian painters may have mingled here a century ago, but the area\u2019s artistic roots and onetime seediness have since become eclipsed by a tacky, theme park atmosphere that residents know to avoid.\n\nThe Lapin Agile, however, remains stalwart. Its nonagenarian owner has likened the cabaret to a boat \u201cnavigating through the heritage of French songs,\u201d but it\u2019s more like a rebellious island unto itself, firmly resisting the weight of passing decades, the changing face of the neighborhood, and the hoards of selfie stick-wielding tourists, some of whom are perplexed by the cabaret\u2019s intractable Frenchness and blatant refusal to step into the 21st century.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t waste your money,\u201d reads one of the more scathing reviews of the joint posted on Google Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s four hours of French-only folk songs with no breaks\u2026 There are no other instruments or acts other than singing with piano\u2026 This is not for tourists who don\u2019t speak French.\u201d\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

As someone whose work schedule involves long hours and very early mornings, the four-hour show took a backseat to getting a decent night\u2019s sleep. Moreover, I had (perhaps a bit too hastily) dismissed it as yet another Montmartre tourist trap \u00e0 la Place du Tertre. However, the indignant reviews intrigued me and prompted me to reconsider. Especially this one:\n\n\u201cThis show was not what I expected. To be fair, the performers were very talented at singing and playing instruments, but if you do not speak French I would not recommend this show.\u201d\n\nThe disappointed tourist added:\n\n\u201cThe five performers sang beautifully, but they were all over 60 years old and I felt like it was in the 1800s.\u201d\n\nThe 1800s? Count me in! I quickly snagged a reservation. The day before the show, I stopped by the cabaret to chat with the owner, Yves Mathieu, a bespectacled 91-year-old who looks at least 15 years younger and has enjoyed a long career as a singer, even performing at Radio City Music Hall back in the \u201850s. On some nights, he still belts out a few tunes at the cabaret\u2014just as his mother did in the late \u201830s when a school-aged Mathieu would watch her act from the sidelines. Mathieu inherited the cabaret from his stepfather almost 50 years ago, and runs it today with the help of his sons, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Vincent.\n\nWe sat on a wooden bench in facing the front door beside a wall lined with china plates, and a photograph of his late wife (a striking Catalan singer) mounted on the other. I asked him why he thought the cabaret had endured for so long, despite the rapidly changing neighborhood.\n\n\u201cHere at the Lapin Agile, we don\u2019t make concessions. It\u2019s very French,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are some French songs performed here that date back to the 15th century.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cYou must always maintain authenticity\u2026 All that is authentic is eternal. In this artificial world people have an increasing need to return to the authentic. To their roots. It\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nOn the night of the show I tried to stop by a little early to get a good seat. No go. The small group of us waiting outside were informed that the doors did not open until 9 p.m. sharp. The silver-haired man who led me to my seat informed me that as it was the start of the country\u2019s October school holidays, many Parisians had left for the week.\n\n\u201cIl sera un peu plus tranquille ce soir que d\u2019habitude.\u201d It will be a bit quieter tonight than usual.\n\nI settled into the long wooden bench and perused the small menu that was placed on top of the dark wooden table etched with dates and doodles, including the name \u201cPauline,\u201d which was carved into the wood in block letters. The menu offers a limited selection of wine, beer, and whisky. Food isn\u2019t served. A reproduction of Picasso\u2019s circa-1905 Au Lapin Agile hangs on one of the walls. In it, the artist is depicted as a morose harlequin who is shunning his former lover\u2014Picasso\u2019s real-life paramour, Germaine Pichot. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9, who commissioned the painting, is visible in the background strumming a guitar. Sotheby\u2019s sold the original in 1989 for $41 million, and it currently hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\nI was soon joined by two American tourists from Washington, D.C., and Chicago, respectively. The pretty young brunettes sported little black dresses that looked somewhat out of place in the cozy room, where slouchy sweaters and casual slacks appeared to be the garments of choice among the staff.\n\nA cute, sweater-clad server stopped by with shot glasses filled with the house specialty\u2014a cloying cherry wine\u2014and explained that he too performed at the cabaret, just not tonight. I looked around the snug space. There were less than a dozen of us, and we were (perhaps unwittingly) segregated, with the French contingent occupying the right side of the room, and the foreigners on the left.\n\nThe show began rather abruptly when a group of six people clustered around one of the tables in front of the piano launched into a bawdy drinking song. The setup reminded me a bit of a tipsy glee club meeting, but the melody wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in a dark, centuries-old tavern lined with wine barrels.\n\n\u201cDo you think these are the performers, or just people from the neighborhood?\u201d the Chicagoan whispered.\n\nThe first two hours of the evening flew by, and included everything from homages to Montmartre to mournful love ballads. A set of performers\u2014a long-married couple\u2014sang a touching duet they had written for their son. There also was a fair share of 20th-century French classics by the likes of Dalida, L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, and Georges Brassens. One singer delivered a particularly moving version of Jacques Brel\u2019s \u201cMon Amour,\u201d and another\u2019s rendition of Edith Piaf\u2019s \u201cLa Foule\u201d was so eerily on point that it seemed as though she were literally channeling the ghost of the iconic chanteuse.\n\nThere are no microphones, and the majority of the songs featured piano accompaniment, although a guitar and an accordion also made an appearance. And the recorder, of course. The man in the tangerine pants continued his serenade with a series of swallow-like trills, before leaning in for a kiss. I obliged him with a peck on the cheek, and the spectators and performers cheered us on.\n\nThese kinds of interactive performances are apparently typical at Au Lapin Agile, and are part of the fun. Thanks to the tight quarters, small audience, and unpretentious vibe, the lines between performers and audience members are blurred, and there were moments during some of the singalongs when I felt like I was at a house party that happened to include a few very talented guests.\n\nAs the show moved into the fourth hour, however, my posterior was starting to feel the effects of the wooden bench. The two Americans had ducked out before 11 p.m., although they claimed to have loved the show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to come back when I speak better French,\u201d the Chicagoan said.\n\nThere were only a few of us left by the time the clock hit 1 a.m.\u2014the enthusiastic French audience on the right and the increasingly befuddled-looking tourists on the left. The show ended as abruptly as it started, and I thanked the performers and stepped outside. A light rain was falling and the streets were quiet. I was back in 21st-century Montmartre with its Instagram-ready facades and bourgeois calm.\n\nSore back (and butt) aside, I had never experienced a Parisian evening quite like this one, and I hadn\u2019t expected to enjoy it as much as I had. It wasn\u2019t just the intimate setting and talented performers, however. There is something admirable about the cabaret\u2019s steadfast devotion to tradition. Bad Google reviews be damned! In this quirky \u201canti-tourist trap,\u201d the show goes on and echoes of Montmartre\u2019s past come alive\u2014if only for a few hours.", "description": "Formerly known as the Cabaret of Assassins, this long-running cabaret is the scourge of selfie stick-wielding tourists expecting France to bend to modernity and online reviews.", "authors": ["Erin Zaleski"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571876354/191023-zaleski-france-caberet-tease-2_tnxuqd", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
