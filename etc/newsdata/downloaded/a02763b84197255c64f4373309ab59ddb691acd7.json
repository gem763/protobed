Nobody mentions it, it\u2019s just about the next game.\n\n\u201cThank God we lost from time to time in the Champions League and other cup competitions so we still know how it feels, because that is really important.\u201d\n\nLiverpool have never won a Premier League match at Bramall Lane and Blades boss Chris Wilder joked that his side might need to play 11 defenders against the European champions.\n\n\u201cWe want to go to Sheffield and make their life as uncomfortable as possible,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re considered a top team but we don\u2019t want to behave like a top team.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why there should be any advantage for Sheffield apart from playing in their own stadium.\u201d\n\nLiverpool impressed in their 2-0 win at MK Dons in the League Cup after Klopp made 11 changes with youngsters coming to the fore, but he said they would have to wait their turn before they were ready for league action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in doubt about these boys and we know what we\u2019re going to do with them and what we expect of them,\u201d the German manager said. \u201cThey have all the time in the world and they\u2019re in a really strong squad, so it\u2019s not easy for them to get in.\n\n\u201cThey have to be patient. We don\u2019t prepare them for one Premier League game, we prepare them for a Premier League career.\u201d\n\nSadio Mane has recovered from a dead leg and striker Divock Origi is also fit but Klopp confirmed Xherdan Shaqiri remains sidelined while goalkeeper Alisson Becker continues his recovery from a calf injury.\n\n\u201cAli looks like he is close but the final work is with the medical department,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIn the last two weeks he has progressed really well. He\u2019s not in contention for tomorrow.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool may be on a 15-match winning run in the Premier League but manager Juergen Klopp said on Friday that he is glad his side has suffered losses in other competitions that have kept their feet firmly on the ground.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434529062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0VL", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
