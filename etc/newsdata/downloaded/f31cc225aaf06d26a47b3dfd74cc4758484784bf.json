Five of the six attacks took place in and around Colombo, the capital.\n\n'Bitter fight'\n\nThe cross-party committee also said \"a bittter fight\" between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that led to a political crisis last year contributed to the security failures.\n\nThe two are from different political parties, and deep differences over policy and a clash of personalities led to Sirisena sacking Wickremesinghe in October. But the president was forced to reverse that decision weeks later, amid opposition from legislators and a series of court interventions.\n\nWednesday's report said Sirisena \"failed on numerous occasions to give leadership and also actively undermined government (security and intelligence) systems\". The president, who is also the minister of defence - had excluded the prime minister and the police chief from crucial national security council meetings, it added.\n\nSirisena has long blamed police chief Pujith Jayasundara and ministry of defence secretary Hemasiri Fernando for lapses, and initiated criminal prosecutions against them.\n\nThe inquiry acknowledged they shouldered some of the blame, but said the director of the SIS, who reported directly to Sirisena, bore \"the greatest responsibility\".\n\nThe report also said further investigation was \"needed to understand whether those with vested interests did not act on intelligence so as to create chaos and instil fear and uncertainty\" in the leadup to the presidential election, due to be held on November 16, the report said.\n\nThe committee recommended reforms in the security and intelligence sectors, improved monitoring of financial transactions, and the monitoring and controlling of religious extremism.\n\nThe report also said there was also no evidence linking the National Thowheed Jamath, which was blamed for the blast - with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS), despite the latter claiming responsibility days later.\n\nThe committee has no powers to indict, but its findings can form the basis of criminal prosecutions or civil action against those identified as being responsible for serious lapses.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Parliament inquiry says bitter feud between president and prime minister led to security lapses ahead of attacks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/4/28/57f7899da32f41759d96e452bf48a6d7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
