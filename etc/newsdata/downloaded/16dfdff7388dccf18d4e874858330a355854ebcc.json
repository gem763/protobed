Prograis boxed with a distinctive guard in which his left glove protected his chin and his right stayed loose, and he southpaw jabbed Taylor, boxing cute, showing superior activity in the early stages of the contest.\n\nTaylor, in contrast, threw less but had superior power, inspiring raucous applause from the partisan crowd whenever he landed a single chin-crunching uppercut. The Briton's defense differed to the American's, keeping both his forearms high to provide a double-gloved shield against Prograis's incoming patter.\n\nThrough four, it was hard to split a winner. The fight, the merging of two champions, always promised to be a technical affair with elite boxing skills on show, and it did not disappoint on the night with both men setting a high pace.\n\nA stamina battle broke out. One decided by who could out-last who. And who could inflict so much misery with their gas-depleting body shots that they'd end up sluggish, with a more porous defense than they had established at the start. Their arms weakening \u2026 that defensive guard loosening \u2014 an invitation for a quick-fire attack.\n\nThat man with the endurance, through six at least, appeared to be Taylor, with Prograis struggling to match the higher tempo. Sensing a shift in work-rate, Taylor worked his way into a higher gear, throwing combinations and attacking Prograis with more purpose than he had shown in the first half of the fight.\n\nWhile Taylor asserted an authority on the fight in the middle rounds, Prograis won a vital eighth, meaning the final four rounds could be essential in deciding a winner in what was a tight, edge-of-your-seat thriller with war wounds developing. For Taylor, it was bruising on the right eye \u2014 a swelling so large it was close to sealing shut. Prograis, meanwhile, had a busted, bloody nose.\n\nSee the damage Prograis did to Taylor here \u2026\n\n\u2026 but see Taylor's superior power here:\n\n\u2014Sporting News Fights (@sn_fights) October 26, 2019\n\nThe championship rounds were not kind to Prograis as blood rushed out of his nose like a waterfall of claret decorating his lips. Neither fighter escaped injury free and will likely be waking up for days to come, wandering into their bathrooms bleary-eyed, looking in the mirror and seeing the damage, then cursing each other aloud.\n\nBut after 12, despite a competitive fight between two athletes at the top of their game, there was only one winner \u2014 Taylor, whose majority decision victory was confirmed by the ring announcer Michael Buffer with scorecards of 114-114, 115-113, 117-112.\n\nWorld Boxing Super Series champion status propels Taylor to the big time\n\nThe World Boxing Super Series is the most prestigious tournament in boxing. Each tournament is worth approximately $25 million in prize money for its competitors combined and forces some of the best fighters in the sport into an easily-consumable product for fans, media, and broadcasters.\n\nAt the end of each season, there are world titles at stake, career-high paydays, and a torso-sized and spiralized Muhammad Ali trophy.\n\nIt also provides a massive platform for the competition winner to go forth into even bigger fights, with the most famous success story from the cruiserweight edition last year, Oleksandr Usyk, recently moving into the heavyweight division where he is eventually expected to provide a reasonable challenge against the best, biggest, and baddest boxers on the planet \u2014 Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury, and Andy Ruiz Jr.\n\nEach of those bouts will be worth millions to Usyk, financially teeing up the charismatic and eccentric Ukrainian for the rest of his life.\n\nThe newest recipient of the Ali trophy, the teak-tough Taylor, has all of this to look forward to. A new potential Usyk who has cleared his division of many of its best competitors, ushering in a new lightweight star.\n\nRead more:\n\nA journalist was told to 'act like a normal guy' after pressing Conor McGregor on the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him\n\nConor McGregor linked with comeback bouts against 4 fighters only weeks after being considered an 'irrelevant' has-been\n\nIreland's next top boxer has a rare shot at retribution after losing at the Olympics because of a 'fixed' fight: 'It's personal for my career, my legacy'\n\nA one-armed athlete returns to Bellator MMA and says he is 'ready to make a statement' in his lightweight fight on Saturday\n\nFormer WWE superstar Jake Hager laughs in the faces of people who think former pro wrestlers can't fight MMA", "description": "Josh Taylor wins the World Boxing Super Series lightweight tournament, unifying his belt with Regis Prograis at the 02 Arena in London.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db4cce0dee01924e758e1d2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
