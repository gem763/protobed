The fact that this really has become a big topic at the IMF speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nAdrian said that to some economies, climate poses a short-term risk, such as in the Bahamas, which was slammed by Hurricane Dorian in September. However, to most economies, the risks are long term.\n\nSome investors have become concerned that climate risk is underpriced in residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, which are pools of home loans sold to investors, with exposure to climate hot spots like Texas and Florida.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund is examining the impact of climate on the world's financial markets and whether it is priced into market valuations, the head of the global lender's markets division said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Megan Davies", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
