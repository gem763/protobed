U.S. Air Force\n\nMELBOURNE, Fla. \u2013 Residents along the Space Coast may have heard a boom early Sunday as the U.S. Air Force's secretive, uncrewed X-37B spaceplane returned to Kennedy Space Center after nearly two years in orbit.\n\nThe X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle completed its fifth mission, landing about 3:51 a.m. Sunday at KSC's space shuttle landing facility for the second time. The 29-foot Boeing spaceplane \u2013 about a quarter the length of a space shuttle \u2013 was greeted by workers in protective suits as it sat on the tarmac.\n\n\u201cThe X-37B continues to demonstrate the importance of a reusable spaceplane,\u201d Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett said in a statement. \u201cEach successive mission advances our nation\u2019s space capabilities.\u201d\n\n'Unbelievable': Samsung space satellite falls out of the sky, lands in rural Michigan neighborhood\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s X-37B landed overnight at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility .

The spaceplane \u2013 initially designed for an orbit duration of 270 days per mission \u2013 has spent 2,865 days orbiting Earth. It is also considered the Air Force's top premier reusable, unmanned spacecraft. Its mission experiments are typically kept top secret but have a focus on Air Force Research Laboratory experiments along with providing a lift into orbit for small satellites.\n\n\u201cThe safe return of this spacecraft, after breaking its own endurance record, is the result of the innovative partnership between Government and Industry,\u201d Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein said in a release. \u201cThe sky is no longer the limit for the Air Force and, if Congress approves, the U.S. Space Force.\u201d\n\nThe shuttle's latest mission launched Sept. 7, 2017, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a Space X Falcon 9 booster. The next flight \u2013 its sixth \u2013 will launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in 2020.\n\nFollow J.D.
