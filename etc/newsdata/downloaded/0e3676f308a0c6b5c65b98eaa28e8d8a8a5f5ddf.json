It has emerged Phil Riley departed the Rugby Football Union earlier this month, becoming the latest member of Eddie Jones\u2019s backroom staff to depart.\n\nRiley had been in his role since last October, though he had been working at age-group level and with the Saxons since 2002. On Friday night a Rugby Football Union spokesman confirmed he had left because of \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. His departure can be considered unsettling to England\u2019s preparations given the importance of a team doctor with an international Test setup, all the more so at a major tournament.\n\nJapan overcome dogged Russia to win opening Rugby World Cup match Read more\n\nRiley was with England on their pre-World Cup camp in Treviso in August as well as for their final warm-up match against Italy in Newcastle earlier this month but he did not travel to Japan. He is the latest example of the high turnover of England\u2019s senior management team since Jones took over. Last summer it emerged Dean Benton, the head of sports science, and Dan Abrahams, the head analyst, were leaving their positions. Before that, Paul Gustard unexpectedly left his role as Jones\u2019s defence coach just over a year out from the World Cup to join Harlequins. Rory Teague also quit his job as skills coach the previous May while a host of other staff members have also left under Jones\u2019s tenure.\n\nRiley has been replaced in Japan by Rob Young, who has previously worked for England under Jones. Young was appointed soon after Jones\u2019s arrival, replacing Nigel Jones, who left in December 2016. Young then left his position in 2018, with Riley taking over in October that year. Riley was praised by Dan Robson, who developed blood clots while in camp with England during the Six Nations and was found to have deep vein thrombosis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known him nine years now and we\u2019ve been very close for that time,\u201d said Robson in May. \u201cWe were chatting every day about it and he\u2019s still been in touch every week, checking up on me. Even just as a friend really which is nice. We\u2019re definitely grateful, not just me but my whole family, are very grateful for all the staff that helped that week and to find it as quickly as we could.\u201d", "description": "England\u2019s World Cup preparations were significantly disrupted after the senior team doctor left his post shortly before the squad flew to Japan", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922da2203f66a3b395ad410a20233470c9c6904e/20_167_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a6ced1692aff6c20cfbc667ba7b177f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
