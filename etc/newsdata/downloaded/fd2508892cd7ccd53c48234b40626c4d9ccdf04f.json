As many as 1.5million Armenians were rounded up, deported and massacred by their Turkish rulers in the early-20th century massacre. Armenians had clashed with Turks as the Ottoman Empire fell apart in the late 19th century and matters came to a head during World War I. The Ottoman Empire entered the war on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1914, and many Armenians were suspected of supporting the Russian enemy. On April 24, 1915, thousands of Armenians suspected of harbouring nationalist sentiments and being hostile to Ottoman rule were rounded up. On May 26, a special law authorised deportations 'for reasons of internal security'. Armenian orphans are deported in 1915, the year the genocide of 1.5million began As many as 1.5million Armenians were killed during the massacre The Armenian population of Anatolia and Cilicia, labelled 'the enemy within', was forced into exile in the Mesopotamian desert. A large number were killed on the way or in the detention camps. Many were burned alive, drowned, poisoned or fell victim to disease, according to foreign diplomats and intelligence services at the time. Others starved to death, or were shot or bayoneted by Ottoman Turkish soldiers. Turkey rejects the term 'genocide', questioning the numbers involved and saying there were fatalities on both sides. In 2014, Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke of 'shared pain' over the killings, but earlier this year he slammed France and Emmanuel Macron for officially commemorating the 'genocide'.\n\nKim was joined on stage with businesswoman Magdalene Yesil, and later engaged in a panel discussion with Alex Chung, Reddit founder and Serena Williams' husband Alexis Ohanian, and PicsArt founder Hovhannes Avoyan.\n\nShe rose to fame as a reality star on E!'s Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2007, but has since transformed into a savvy businesswoman - with a series of successful make-up, clothing and perfume lines under her belt.\n\nThe media personality is said to boast a net worth of $370 million.

The celebrity lawyer, who passed away in 2003 just eight weeks after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, passed on his pride in his heritage to his family, who have been vocal about their Armenian roots. Robert's ancestors fled the Armenian Genocide in the early 20th century, thanks to a 'prophet' who urged them to uproot to America. Known at the time as the Kardaschoffs, in Russian style, the family made their way from their home village of Karakale in the late 19th Century to German ports. From there, they travelled to a new life in America on the passenger vessels SS Brandenberg and SS Koln. Treated like royalty: Kim and Khloe were treated to a special dinner with locals in Armenia when they visited in 2015 By doing so, they escaped the triple horror of the First World War from 1914-18, the 'Armenian Genocide' starting in 1915 - exactly a century ago this year - and the Russian Revolution in 1917. Among those fleeing Erzurum - then in Armenia, and ruled by last Russian Tsar Nicholas II was family patriarch Hovhannes Miroyan and Kim's great great grandfather, born in 1844. He married Luciag Chorbajian, born in 1853. The couple wed in Erzurum, which is now in Turkey, in 1867 but escaped along with their daughter Vartanoosh Mironyan, born in 1886, in the early 20th century. Vartanoosh's distinctly blonde daughter Haigoohi Arakelian - known as Helen, born in America in 1917, the year the Bolshevik Revolution rocked the Russian Empire - was Kim's grandmother, who later married into the Kardashian clan. The glamorous and 'dynamic' Helen wed Arthur who ran the largest meat-packing business in southern California. Helen's son Robert married Kris Houghton and fathered the 21st Century's biggest reality TV stars Kourtney, Khloe, Robert Jr and most famous of all - Kim. Their mother Kris eventually married Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner, now Caitlyn Jenner, and together they raised two more TV personalities, Kendall and Kylie.\n\nKim shared: 'It was really my first tech venture. I was unsure at first, as to how I'd make it authentic to me. But the concept was really cute, and the fact that I'd have a big say in what my character would do and wear.\n\n'Since it's called Kim Kardashian Hollywood, a lot of it has to do with the clothes the character is buying and wearing in photoshoots in Hollywood. I think it's maintained its success due to me just being so involved.'\n\nThe Vogue coverstar recently hinted she's planning to produce SKIMS in Armenia. The Armenian National Committee of America tweeted at the time: 'Thank you @KimKardashian for considering #Armenia as a future site for @skims production!\n\n'We look forward to your upcoming trip to Armenia, value all you do to share our heritage, and love and respect your family's passion for #Armenian #Genocide recognition.'\n\nCheery: The social media sensation beamed with delight as she waved at the crowd during her trip\n\nExcited: Feeling giddy about her trip, the entrepreneur tweeted: 'Almost 3 am in Armenia and I can't sleep I'm so excited to be here and see everyone!'\n\n'I have big plans': Kim recently revealed her plans to produce her shapewear range in Armenia last month\n\nShe replied: 'Thank you! I've been working extremely hard on this matter and hope my trip to Armenia will bring some amazing news because I have big plans!'\n\nEarlier in the week, Kim was joined by sister Kourtney, 40, and her children as they witnessed her kids get baptised.\n\nIn April 2015, the make-up mogul and her husband Kanye West, 42, baptised their eldest daughter North, six, into the Armenian Apostolic Church in Jerusalem, which was held at a 12th Century church within the walls of the Old City.\n\nA baptism or christening serves as a symbol of purification and admission to the Christian Church. In Armenian culture, those being baptised traditionally wear white.\n\nTender moments: In April 2015, the make-up mogul and her husband Kanye West, 42, baptised their eldest daughter North into the Armenian Apostolic Church in Jerusalem (pictured)\n\nFeeling giddy about her trip, Kim - whose family fled the country and relocated to in the early 20th century - tweeted: 'Almost 3 am in Armenia and I can't sleep I'm so excited to be here and see everyone!'\n\nShe first visited Armenia with sister Khloe, 35, mother Kris Jenner, 63, husband Kanye and their daughter North in 2015.\n\nDuring their visit, the reality stars laid red tulips at the memorial commemorating the victims of the Armenian genocide 100 years ago.\n\nThe group visited the eternal flame of the Armenian Genocide Memorial Complex on the outskirts of Yerevan as part of an eight-day tour of the country.", "description": "Kim and Kourtney Kardashian laid flowers at the Armenian Genocide Memorial Complex in Tsitsernakaberd, Yerevan on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/18/19454526-0-image-a-29_1570556697532.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
