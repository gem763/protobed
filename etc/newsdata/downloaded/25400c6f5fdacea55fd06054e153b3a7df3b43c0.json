Vuong was chosen alongside six other writers: graphic novelist Lynda Barry, cultural historian Saidiya Hartman, the Booker-longlisted author Valeria Luiselli, American historian Kelly Lytle Hernandez, literary scholar Jeffrey Miller and classicist Emily Wilson, who in 2017 was the first woman to publish a translation of Homer\u2019s Odyssey in English.\n\nThe MacArthur Foundation praised Vuong for poetry that marries \u201cfolkloric traditions with linguistic experimentation\u201d. His is a \u201cvital new literary voice demonstrating mastery of multiple poetic registers while addressing the effects of intergenerational trauma, the refugee experience, and the complexities of identity and desire,\u201d it added.\n\nOcean Vuong and the new Great American Novel - books podcast Read more\n\nWinner of the TS Eliot and Forward prizes for his debut collection, Night Sky With Exit Wounds, Vuong recently published his first novel, On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous. \u201cOften we demand of the American novel to be cohesive, a monolithic statement of a generation, but having grown up post-9/11, cohesion was not part of my generation\u2019s imagination nor our language or self-identity, and I felt if I was to write my version of the American novel it would have to look more like fragmentation,\u201d said Vuong in an interview for the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nThe loosely autobiographical novel is written as a letter to a mother who cannot speak English or read. \u201cI grew up surrounded by Vietnamese refugee women who used stories to create portals,\u201d said Vuong. \u201cI use language and literature as a way to orchestrate a framework to think and inquire about American life, including the legacy of American violence.\u201d\n\nIn total, 26 fellows have been chosen by the foundation this year, from geochemist Andrea Dutton to visual artist Jeffrey Gibson. President John Palfrey said that all the fellows \u201cgive us reason for hope, and they inspire us all to follow our own creative instincts\u201d.", "description": "The MacArthur Foundation honours, which encourage winners to \u2018continue to innovate\u2019, also won by Valeria Luiselli, Lynda Berry and Emily Wilson", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e05286b6e7ed9e2ead9a96807305e0ce464901/0_1672_12385_7433/master/12385.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6928694657f3530f9dbb19f1d6986e77", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
