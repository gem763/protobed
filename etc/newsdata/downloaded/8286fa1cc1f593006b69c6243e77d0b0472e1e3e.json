CME pointed out that this occurred despite the fact that Bitcoin has dropped almost 25% in price.\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that CME is adding options to its Bitcoin futures contracts in the first quarter of 2020, pending regulatory review. The CME Group global head of equity index and alternative investment products, Tim McCourt, said at the time:\n\n\"Based on increasing client demand and robust growth in our Bitcoin futures markets, we believe the launch of options will provide our clients with additional flexibility to trade and hedge their bitcoin price risk.\"\n\nMcCourt said trading had picked up for the Bitcoin futures, with May being a record month, where 34,000 futures contracts were traded, worth $1.3 billion and equivalent to 170,000 BTC. Meanwhile, institutional interest in CME Bitcoin futures peaked in early summer 2019, with a record 56 large open interest holders reported in July.\n\nIn an SCMP report, McCourt said that he expects futures trading volume to also come from miners seeking more precise exposures, and not just from traders, adding:\n\n\u201cWhile futures give you a one-for-one exposure [\u2026] an option gives you varying strike-price levels and can give you either downside protection or upside exposure at a fraction of the underlying price.\u201d\n\nCME has no plans for physically settled Bitcoin contracts\n\nOn Oct. 1, McCourt stated that CME has no current plans to launch physically settled Bitcoin contracts. Its current Bitcoin futures contracts are settled in cash and McCourt added that \u201cthe number one demand from customers has been for options on our futures\u201d since the launch of its futures product.", "description": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group recently said that, despite the Bitcoin price drop, customer interest in CME Bitcoin futures remained strong", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80NmU1MmMzOGE1M2JmYmEzNGVhMjI5ZTI3YjljZTM1OC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
