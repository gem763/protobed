The process of using one source for multiple media adaptations is called One Source Multi Use (OSMU) and the place where the creators behind these properties meet film studios is the Asian Film Market (AFM) at the annual Busan International Film Festival (BIFF).Here, artists and authors who have been carefully selected among hundreds by event organizers pitch their ideas to local or overseas filmmakers looking for new stories to tell. They each get to present their works for about 10 minutes.The notable trend at this year\u2019s market were stories that contained or reflected sensitive social issues such as misogyny, serial killers and the ever-sensitive relationship between Korea and Japan.The Korea JoongAng Daily attended two of the events hosted by the market - the Comics & Film Pitching Show, which was co-organized by the Korea Manhwa Contents Agency, and Story to Film, which was co-organized by the Korea Creative Content Agency, to find out what stories peaked the interest of movie industry insiders.

The two set out to search for the mysterious artist and, hopefully, to find his missing friend.Creator Kim Hyun-jung said in her pitch that she wanted to highlight crimes against women and the issue of gender polarization in her work. \u201cWomen are striking back,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been holding back for years, and I wanted to show how scary it could be when they don\u2019t.\u201dSeo-wu is an 18-year-old high school student who is 183 centimeters (6 feet) tall and looks more like a handsome boy than a girl.

He and his friend Park Eo-dun are captured by the Tokugawa shogunate (the final feudal Japanese military government) and fight for their land and fishing rights. Ahn even requires a note from the government stating that Ulleung Island is part of Joseon. On his way back, however, the document is confiscated by Japanese forces.Ahn soon realizes that he had become a pawn of Japan\u2019s elaborate scheme to take Ulleung Island as its own under the Japanese name Takeshima. Enraged by Japan\u2019s conduct and incompetence of the current administration to fight for their land, Ahn calls himself \u201cThe Chief of Tax of Ulleungdo and Dokdo\u201d to get rid of Japanese fishermen and protect the land.BY LEE JAE-LIM [lee.jaelim@joongang,co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/10193643.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
