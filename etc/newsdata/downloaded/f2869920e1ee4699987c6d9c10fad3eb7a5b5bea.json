Recent footage was released showing officers kicking what a senior police official described as a \u201cyellow object\u201d \u2013 when it was clearly a human being lying on the ground dressed in a yellow shirt.\n\nLeaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle have made strong statements condemning the Chinese and Hong Kong governments' exploits \u2013 but now is the time to attach action to words.\n\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act will send an important signal that the United States will act to protect the rights of the people of Hong Kong \u2013 and continue to be a leading advocate for freedom in the world.\n\nCongress can do this by passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 introduced by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. The bill would hold Hong Kong and Chinese officials accountable for their promises to protect the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people.\n\nIn 1984, under China's \"One Country, Two Systems\u201d model, China signed a joint declaration with the British that would give Hong Kong a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d after the 1997 handover. It protected Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms, \u201cincluding those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief.\u201d\n\nThe declaration further promised to uphold the rule of law and protect human rights and Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 Basic Law, which identified democratic elections as an \"ultimate aim.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn 1992, the United States passed the Hong Kong Policy Act, which resulted in Hong Kong being treated separately from the rest of mainland China in terms of trade, commerce, immigration, investment, and cultural and educational collaborations. However, while Hong Kong has grown to become an international economic and business hub (America was Hong Kong\u2019s No. 2 trading partner in 2018), it has not evolved into the democratic and free \"special administrative region\" promised decades ago.\n\nAs Hong Kong moves toward what a report by the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee called \u201cOne Country, One and a Half Systems\u201d \u2013 with the Communist Party\u2019s approach being closer to a \u201cOne Country, One System\u201d model \u2013 the United States must not turn a blind eye to the violations against Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and autonomy.\n\nUnder the policy act, Hong Kong\u2019s special treatment is based upon its maintenance of its promised autonomy. These privileges however can be selectively suspended by the president through executive order.\n\nIn Congress, the proposed Human Rights and Democracy Act expands on this by directing \u201cvarious departments to assess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify changing Hong Kong's unique treatment under US law.\u201d\n\nIt requires the State Department to annually certify and report to Congress whether Hong Kong\u2019s status of autonomy, and the government\u2019s adherence to protecting civil liberties and upholding of the rule of law justify its continued special status.\n\nThe Commerce Department would also submit an annual report to Congress that determines if China is exploiting Hong Kong to circumvent U.S. sanctions and export controls.\n\nThis important bill also would ensure that violators of human rights in the region are held accountable by applying sanctions and banning entry to the U.S. It also provides protections for nonviolent protesters who have been arrested for defending human rights or the rule of law in Hong Kong by prohibiting denial of U.S. visas.\n\nThe final version of the Human Rights and Democracy Act must include all of these requirements, and it must be passed into law.\n\nI recently signed a letter to Congress calling for its passage. The United States has a clear moral and economic interest in preserving the autonomy and freedoms allotted to the people of Hong Kong.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Human Rights and Democracy Act will send an important signal that the United States will act to protect the rights of the people of Hong Kong \u2013 and continue to be a leading advocate for freedom in the world.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "Passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act by Congress is urgently needed now.
