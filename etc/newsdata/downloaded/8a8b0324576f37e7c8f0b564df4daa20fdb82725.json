Biden had a 71%-22% favorable-unfavorable split among Democrats and independents who lean Democrat. In January, Mr. Biden had a 76%-11% split.\n\n\u201cOne of the initial senses of what Joe Biden presented was that he seemed to be less of a risk, but his performance so far has not been gaffe-proof, and, as a result, people are not as comfortable, and that opened up the door for others, and particularly Warren,\u201d Mr. Miringoff said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen.
