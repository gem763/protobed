Manulife has staked its success on three key themes:\n\nInvesting heavily in Asia and riding the wave of a rapidly growing middle class;\n\nAttracting new customers through its banking arm in Canada; and\n\nEmbracing technology and innovative digital solutions.\n\nCracking the Asia code According to recent research by Knight Frank LLP, the number of Asian billionaires will increase by 27% by 2023, making up more than one-third of the world\u2019s total billionaire population. To put that super-charged growth in perspective, the billionaire population growth rates for North America and Europe are only 17% and 18%, respectively.\n\nManulife is no stranger to Asia. In fact, it has been there since 1897, when it sold its first insurance policy in Shanghai, China. That equates to a 125-year history in a region that many North American companies have not been able to figure out. The culture and ways of doing business in the eastern part of the world are very different from the west, and Manulife has cracked that code.\n\nManulife has used its long history in the region to deepen its roots, most recently with a joint venture this year with India\u2019s Mahindra and Mahindra, a firm with more than six million customers and growing rapidly. Manulife also continues to build in China and is also active in Japan, Vietnam, and several other key Asian countries.\n\nIt also helps that Roy Gori, Manulife\u2019s CEO, has spent a significant portion of his career working in Asia, first as Citibank\u2019s Head of Retail Banking for the Asia-Pacific region and then with Manulife as the Asian divisional CEO. If any leader can crack Asia, it is Roy.\n\nManulife operates as a retail bank as well You can bet your bottom dollar that Manulife also has a Canadian banking licence, and it is rapidly scaling to provide everyday banking solutions that appeal specifically to millennials, who will represent 50-75% of the Canadian population by 2025.\n\nManulife\u2019s banking arm is completely branchless, which means it avoids costly real estate and can spend its energy designing customer-friendly products, like its 1.2% interest-bearing savings account.\n\nManulife will never be a retail banking powerhouse like RBC or TD, but that is not the goal. The goal is simply to entice customers away from comparable online banks or credit unions such as Tangerine, Simplii Financial, or First Ontario Credit Union, and then offer more services to them over time.\n\nConquering the digital world Manulife CEO Roy Gori has famously said that he wants to bring the dull insurance industry out of the \u201cdark ages.\u201d\n\nRoy has gone on the digital offensive, and an example of this fresh thinking is Manulife\u2019s recently inked partnership with Ireland\u2019s Blink Innovation. Blink and Manulife will collaborate to develop bespoke travel insurance solutions that customers can access with their smartphones.\n\nBlink monitors global flight disruptions as they happen, which will allow Manulife to offer its customers an innovative real-time travel insurance purchasing service to cover the risk of flight delays.\n\nComplimentary services will also be provided to customers purchasing the insurance, such as access to airport lounges, hotel rebooking options, and instant payment if flights are delayed for more than three hours.\n\nThis partnership is a masterstroke from Manulife, because the travel insurance market is growing rapidly, and unpredictable global weather patterns make travel disruption more likely.\n\nThe final verdict Manulife\u2019s razor-sharp focus on these three key themes will ensure growth in cash flow and dividends for many years to come.\n\nWith a stock price of around $22 a share at the time of writing, Manulife should be an extremely compelling investment proposition for smart investors who are focused on the long term.\n\nFool contributor Rahim Bhayani has no position in the companies mentioned.\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s purpose is to help the world invest, better.
