Let\u2019s start with pessimism: Some people are burned out. In her book \u201cAmerican Resistance: From the Women\u2019s March to the Blue Wave,\u201d Dana Fisher, a professor at the University of Maryland, described how a series of \u201cmoral shocks\u201d propelled people who hadn\u2019t thought of themselves as activists to join protests. But after three years of Trumpism, it takes more to shock people than it used to. \u201cPeople have grown accustomed to a certain baseline level of outrage,\u201d Fisher told me.\n\nBut that\u2019s far from the whole story. Fisher surveyed people at the Women\u2019s March and other demonstrations, and then tracked them afterward, doing follow-up surveys six months before the midterms and two days after. \u201cAll of their levels of civic engagement went up,\u201d she said.\n\nMany had called elected officials and attended town halls. Now, she says, much of the Resistance is focused on organizing for presidential candidates, particularly Elizabeth Warren. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019re seeing less protest is that protest is being seen as the beginning of activism and political involvement rather than being the end,\u201d she said.\n\nSo if America isn\u2019t seeing the sort of huge demonstrations roiling other countries, it\u2019s at least in part because those most fiercely opposed to Trump still believe in the power of our democracy to get rid of him. \u201cPeople actually trust the election to sort it out,\u201d said Chenoweth. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s common in democracies \u2014 when you start to see a protest wave really pick up, a lot of time that mobilization really gets filtered into the next election.\u201d\n\nBut the next election is a year away, and American democracy is in danger now. You can\u2019t count on an election to restrain the president when the president is using the power of his office to subvert the election with foreign interference. Each day, it seems, Trump and those around him become increasingly brazen in their lawbreaking.", "description": "With impeachment looming, it\u2019s time to take to the streets again.", "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/opinion/21goldbergWeb/21goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
