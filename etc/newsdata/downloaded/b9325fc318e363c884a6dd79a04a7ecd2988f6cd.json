No this is not a drill.\n\nThe blocks honouring the cult-fave NZ treat, Pascall\u2019s Pineapple Lumps, have been spied in stores across the country, causing folks to suddenly be torn between it and the other limited-edition choc, the Caramilk.\n\nThe limited-edition choccies feature the classic Aussie Cadbury milk chocolate with a bunch of pineapple-flavoured marshmallows on the inside, adequately satiating the cravings your Kiwi mates have had while away from the motherland. I can 100% bet you that my brother\u2019s going to take some home to his NZ-born fianc\u00e9e, and if he doesn\u2019t I will personally go over to his house to rouse on him.\n\nIn New Zealand, there\u2019s also chat of a mashup of Pineapple Lumps and Perky Nana bars with bags of Perky Nana Lumps appearing in shops, and I\u2019m crossing all my fingers and toes that Perky Nana blocks don\u2019t find their way over here because banana-flavoured anything is from the kitchens of hell. Yuck, no thanks. Cast it back into the pits of Dante\u2019s Inferno, thank you.\n\nWe grabbed a block from our local IGA for a tight $3.49, so deeply consider popping down to your nearest shop to grab one on the way home this arv.", "description": "Pineapple Lumps, the NZ cult fave choccy, has been spotted in full Cadbury block form in Aussie shops and we were not ready for this blessing.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pineapple-lumps-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
