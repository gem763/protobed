Be that as it may, you need to note that this investigation was not our own initiative, it was as a result of a complaint being lodged with our office,\u201d said Mkhwebane.\n\nShe said Nkabinde\u2019s complaint alleged irregularities in \u201cprocurement, appointments and administration\u201d relating to the appointment of Botha.\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, he made the following complaints, that Ipid changed and manipulated the requirements of the post of deputy director in order to suit Botha without any job evaluation processes being conducted by a job analyst as required by the institution\u2019s own policies. As a result the complainant and other candidates that had applied for the job were disadvantaged and prejudiced by this maladministration and nepotism,\u201d said Mkhwebane.\n\nShe went on to reveal that Nkabinde alleged that an internal investigation was conducted and adverse finding against senior officials at Ipid was reached, however, its recommendations were never implemented. Instead, the complainant was suspended \u201cin retaliation\u201d for raising the matter and in particular his disclosing of \u201cunethical conduct\u201d.\n\nRead: Mkhwebane fights to keep Sars \u2018rogue unit\u2019 report\n\nthe timing was \u201csuspicious\"\n\nShe added that during her office\u2019s investigation they came across information that suggested that Ipid did not follow proper procurement processes and appointed Botha to a post that never existed before.\n\nMcBride hit back at Mkhwebane\u2019s report, saying the timing was \u201csuspicious in that the release is on the eve of the widely anticipated testimony of senior Ipid investigators at the Zondo commission into state capture at which evidence started today [Wednesday]\u201d.\n\nHe said the report was likely to interrupt Ipid\u2019s investigations into the alleged corruption and looting within the police because the report implicated most of Ipid\u2019s executive members.\n\nHe added that he was likely to take the \u201chighly questionable\u201d report on review.\n\nOn Thursday, spokesperson of the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services, Bulelani Magwanishe, announced 28 candidates, including McBride, who stand in line to take over the role of deputy public protector, which will become vacant when incumbent Kevin Malunga\u2019s tenure expires in December.", "description": "Former Ipid head Robert McBride has hit back at a scathing report by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane that could derail his bid to become the next deputy public protector.", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9107/337f99741ade493cbb3e080e2105c80f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
