Truth is, they probably have no idea just how silly are the things they\u2019re promoting.\n\n\u201cWe, the youth of America, are striking because the science says we have just a few years to transform our energy system, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the worst effects of climate change,\u201d the manifesto of the Youth Climate Strike (one of the event\u2019s sponsors) begins. That sobering sentence is followed by a set of profoundly unserious demands, beginning with 400 words on why this all-consuming threat to the very habitability of the planet is most pronounced for women and minorities.\n\nStrikers assert that \u201cmarginalized communities,\u201d including the impoverished, disabled, LGBT and minorities, and the economically displaced should be foremost on the minds of policymakers.\n\nThe game is further given up when the strikers endorse progressive reforms that relate to climate change only as a result of a stretch of the imagination. Among them, the creation of state-owned banks, affordable housing, \u201clocal living-wage jobs\u201d and \u201cfully paid quality health care\u201d for affected populations.\n\nAll this fits with the organizer\u2019s prime directive: the \u201cimplementation of a Green New Deal,\u201d the bulk of which is only tangentially related to environmentalism.\n\nIt calls for the shuttering of all fossil-fuel-generating power plants, replacing the country\u2019s energy grid, upgrading and renovating \u201cevery residential and industrial building\u201d in America, reducing US productive agricultural capacity, retiring the combustion engine and phasing out fossil fuels entirely by 2030.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn\u2019t originally a climate thing at all,\u201d confesses Saikat Chakrabarti, former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cWe really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.\u201d He wasn\u2019t kidding.\n\nAs for the strikers, clearly they seem to want it every which way. Take their insistence on halting the \u201ccreation of additional fossil fuel infrastructure.\u201d Though the proposal says we should \u201crespect the contributions of fossil fuel workers\u201d (if only to \u201creskill\u201d them so they can be productive members of the new utopia), it also insists the country \u201chold polluters accountable.\u201d\n\nFossil fuel \u201cexecutives\u201d will be compelled to \u201cmake reparations,\u201d pay for \u201cclimate damages\u201d and fund the wholesale transition to technology that doesn\u2019t yet exist.\n\nsee also Birds are disappearing from North America Billions of birds have vanished from North American skies over...\n\n\u201cAll decisions made by the government,\u201d the YCS manifesto adds, should \u201cbe tied in scientific research, including the 2018 IPCC report.\u201d It\u2019s fortunate that the strikers didn\u2019t base their worldview on the IPCC\u2019s 2001 assessment report, which predicted that milder winter temperatures would decrease the severity and frequency of snowstorms (it has not).\n\nNor did the organizers unwisely embrace the 2007 IPCC assessment report, which warned that by 2020 hundreds of millions of people would be affected by \u201cincreased water stress,\u201d reducing the yield from food crops. Today, rain-fed yields from agriculture in developed and developing countries are projected to increase dramatically.\n\nThe strikers further warn that the world is on the verge of a new \u201cmass species extinction,\u201d also based on UN-sponsored \u201cscience.\u201d They\u2019d be heartened to learn how a similar 2007 projection by the UN\u2019s Convention on Biological Diversity failed to materialize. Or, at least, they would if they hadn\u2019t suspended critical thought.\n\nUnfortunately for students, the movement is not about education but indoctrination. One of the final demands, \u201ccomprehensive climate change education,\u201d is to be aimed at children ages 5 through 14 because \u201cimpressionability is high during that developmental stage.\u201d\n\nIf the climate threat eventually leads to radical national action, it will only be because the concept is drilled into youngsters \u201cfrom the beginning.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s unclear why such a long-term strategy is necessary, given that we have only \u201c11 years\u201d left to avert disaster.\n\nJudging from the bizarre, extremist, sloppily composed manifesto, the students who have the city Education Department\u2019s blessing to attend this event clearly won\u2019t be learning much of anything truly \u201cscience-based.\u201d The rest of us, however, are learning quite a lot about the climate change movement, and it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nNoah Rothman is the associate editor of Commentary.", "description": "Judging from the bizarre, extremist, sloppily composed manifesto, the students who have the city Education Department\u2019s blessing to attend this event clearly won\u2019t be learning much of anything truly \u201cscience-based.\u201d", "authors": ["September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-strike.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
