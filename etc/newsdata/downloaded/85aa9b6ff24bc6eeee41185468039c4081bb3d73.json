There's only about US$500 billion currently dedicated to impact investing, far below the US$7 trillion to US$8 trillion needed to reach the goals by 2030. On a positive note, impact investing did double last year, but still only represents 0.5 per cent of total assets managed worldwide.\n\nThe 46-year-old Ms Campbell is former chief executive officer of Swedish private equity firm Ratos AB. She's also adviser and board member of Northvolt, the Swedish battery maker, which she says has \"the vision to take carbon dioxide out of the transportation industry\".\n\nGet the latest on startups\n\nand business news Terms & conditions Sign up\n\n\"A great example of how you can ride a strong and fast transition trend and at the same time also build a very good business,\" she said.\n\nNorthvolt is currently building factories in Sweden and in Germany, as part of a vision to create a European battery industry to take on the Chinese.\n\nShe's also in charge of impact investments at Norrsken, a 300 million krona (S$42.1 million) portfolio of startups. It has a who's who of backers, including Niklas Adalberth, who's behind digital payments powerhouse Klarna, Sebastian Knutsson of Candy-Crush Maker King Digital Entertainment plc, Filip Tysander of watch brand Daniel Wellington and Carl Manneh who helped start Mojang AB, the developer of Minecraft.\n\nThe Norrsken portfolio consists of investments in 20 early stage companies with tech solutions to handle problems in areas like food waste, e-health and green energy.\n\nMs Campbell said she expects large Swedish private equity companies such as EQT and Nordic Capital to soon also start impact funds. Earlier this year, Jan Stahlberg, the co-founder of EQT, left the firm to join forces with Nordea Bank Abp and founded Trill Impact, a fund targeting non-listed companies with strong sustainability targets.\n\n\"I hope and believe impact investing is going to become mainstream, as it's based on very strong macro trends,\" she said. \"It's built on things that must happen.\"\n\nHere are some companies in the Norrsken portfolio:\n\nMatsmart. The company helps food giants such as Nestle SA sell products that are about to expire or have faulty packaging. Germany's Metro AG also invested in the last funding round through its investment arm, LeadX Capital Partners.\n\nEinride. The developer of autonomous vehicles recently raised US$25 million to fund an expansion to the US. It's also backed by EQT and Ericsson Ventures, among others.\n\nHeart Aerospace. Develops electric planes for commercial use. Also backed by California innovation fund Y Combinator.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Garage - [STOCKHOLM] Almost three years after starting her first impact investing fund, Susanna Campbell still finds her market a bit lonely at times. .
