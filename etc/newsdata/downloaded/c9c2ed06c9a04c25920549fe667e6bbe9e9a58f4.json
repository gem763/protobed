It applies to people seeking immigrant visas from abroad, not those already in the country, and doesn\u2019t affect asylum seekers, refugees or children.\n\n\u201cCongress makes laws, the president executes them. This is an egregious attempt to supercede and overturn congressional will, not only in the immigration realm but in the health care realm,\u201d said Jesse Bless, director of federal litigation at the American Immigration Lawyers Association who helped file the case.\n\nJustice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe rule is the Trump administration\u2019s latest effort to limit immigrant access to public programs while trying to move the country away from a family-based immigration system and into a merit-based system.\n\nEarlier this year, the administration made sweeping changes to regulations that would deny green cards to immigrants who use some forms of public assistance, but the courts have blocked that measure.\n\nUnder the government\u2019s visa rule, the required insurance can be bought individually or provided by an employer and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic.\n\nMedicaid doesn\u2019t count, and an immigrant can\u2019t get a visa if using the Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies when buying insurance. The federal government pays for those subsidies.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks class-action status and to block the rule from taking effect.\n\nThe rule is a problem for Iris Angelina Castro, an American citizen from Springfield, Illinois. The former teacher has applied for her husband, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, to obtain an immigrant visa to join her in the United States.\n\nHe\u2019s been preparing paperwork for a consular interview, but now they doubt he will qualify because she quit her job after her son got sick and now has state health insurance, according to the complaint.\n\nShe is pregnant with her second child and wants her husband to be there for the birth of their daughter.\n\nOther plaintiffs in the lawsuit are trying to bring their spouses to live with them from Mexico and Germany. One woman is trying to bring her parents from Nicaragua and hasn\u2019t been able to find them reasonable health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an impossibility,\u201d said Bless, the attorney. \u201cThere\u2019s been no standards provided to show: \u2018How much money do I need to show that I can pay for my own care?\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nTaxin reported from Santa Ana, California.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A lawsuit Wednesday accused the Trump administration of preventing Americans from bringing their foreign spouses and parents to live with them in the United States by requiring those immigrants to prove they can afford health care before they get visas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Amy Taxin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/trump_90305_c0-142-3411-2131_s1200x700.jpg?5f54ca1f356b0ddd0d71bf9e948351403975cc49", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
