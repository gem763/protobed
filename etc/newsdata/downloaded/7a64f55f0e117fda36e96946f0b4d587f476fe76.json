In Gupta\u2019s version, colonial politics are inescapably intertwined with an inflexible patriarchy and, although I have the odd caveat, Rachel O\u2019Riordan\u2019s production gets the Lyric\u2019s new regime off to a rousing start.\n\nFollowing Ibsen\u2019s structure, Gupta turns Tom Helmer into a chief of tax collection who exoticises his wife, Niru, as his \u201clittle Indian princess\u201d. This instantly highlights the isolation of Niru, a sari-wearing Christian convert regarded with equal suspicion by the colonial wives and her fellow Indians. It also allows Gupta to fascinatingly redefine the other characters. Niru\u2019s closest friend, the terminally ill Dr Rank, becomes a fiercely pro-Indian expat who argues that it\u2019s the English that need civilizing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An irredeemable creep ...

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nIbsen\u2019s blackmailing Krogstad, whose power resides in his knowledge that the heroine has forged her father\u2019s signature, is also transformed into the more complex figure of the lowly clerk, Kaushik Das. When he declares that he will rise through the ranks so that \u201cit\u2019ll be me, an Indian, calling the shots,\u201d you hear the stored up resentment of an oppressed people.\n\nEverything in Ibsen has been shrewdly reimagined: Niru shows her command over Rank by getting him to tie dancing-bells round her ankles. Anjana Vasan gives a career-defining performance as Niru. She captures perfectly the gradations in Niru\u2019s character as she moves from the assumed role of skittish, smiling child bride to the suicidal frenzy of a dance that has her beating the walls in despair to the poised, climactic declaration of independence. It\u2019s a measure of Vasan\u2019s success that she seems to age 20 years in the course of the performance. Elliot Cowan is equally assured as Tom and, if I have any criticism of Gupta\u2019s text, it is that it makes his character seem an irredeemable creep as, at the end, he moves from racist abuse of Niru to patronising ingratiation. I miss the note of hope Ibsen offers of Tom\u2019s possible moral reawakening. But there is superb support from Colin Tierney as an anti-colonial Rank, Assad Zaman as the understandably vengeful Das and Tripti Tripuraneni as a self-sacrificing Indian widow.\n\nDeftly staged around Lily Arnold\u2019s tiered courtyard, this is a fine production that makes us see a familiar classic through fresh eyes.\n\n\u2022 At Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 5 October.", "description": "With a career-defining performance from Anjana Vasan, Tanika Gupta\u2019s fine production is moving, multilayered and hugely intelligent", "authors": ["Michael Billington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3c820be53676ad639722306d7862ec2e98d1e3f/0_168_4550_2730/master/4550.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8f189ef2c425476e5a8f5d310465082c", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
