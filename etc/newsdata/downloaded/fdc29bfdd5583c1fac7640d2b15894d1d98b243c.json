Even in leadership settings, women are still expected to be more communal than their male counterparts.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

business news article about an auto manufacturer and then complete a survey about their intent to buy a vehicle from the company.\n\nOne-third of the participants read about an ethical failure, while one-third read about a competence failure and the final third only read the company description.\n\nThe participants were then asked how likely they were to purchase a car from the company the next time they were in the market for a vehicle and reported their trust in the organisation.\n\n\u201cWhen participants were told that the company had previously been made aware of a fuel sensor problem and failed to take immediate action, an ethical failure, they reported less intent to purchase from the company when the CEO was a woman than when the CEO was a man,\u201d said Montgomery.\n\n\u201cHowever, when participants were told that the company was previously unaware of the product issue, a competence failure, they reported greater intent to buy the products when the CEO was a woman than when the CEO was a man.\u201d\n\nThe purchase intentions for the group that read only the company description did not vary based on the CEO\u2019s gender.\n\nFor the second experiment, the researchers altered how female and male CEOs were described, using traits that are stereotypically associated with females, such as \u201chelpful\u201d and \u201csensitive\u201d, or traits that are stereotypically associated with males, including \u201cskilled\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d.\n\nThe 416 participants in this study read the same news article as in the previous experiment and completed the same survey questions about their buying intentions and trust in the company.\n\nSimilar to the previous experiment, when participants read about an ethical failure where the CEO was described using traits consistent with stereotypes participants were less likely to buy from the company led by the female CEO.\n\n\u201cWhen leaders are described in ways that reinforce stereotypes, we continue to find that people penalise female-led organisations more for ethical failures, but we can reduce these penalties for female-led organisations by highlighting traits of their leaders,\u201d said co-author Amanda Cowen.\n\nFor the final experiment, Montgomery and Cowen explored whether consumers\u2019 judgments would change if the female CEOs led businesses that operated in industries that are viewed as more stereotypically feminine, such as a company making children's products.\n\nParticipants indicated they would be less likely to purchase from a female-led organisation in both stereotypically male (automotive) and stereotypically female (child products) industries after an ethical failure, according to the researchers.\n\nHowever, participants\u2019 responses to competence failures differed depending on the industry.\n\n\u201cIn the auto industry, which is typically viewed as more male, participants penalised female-led organisations less than male-led organisations for competence failures,\u201d Cowan said.\n\n\u201cHowever, the opposite was true for a child products company. In that setting, participants who read about a competence failure penalised female-led organisations more than male-led organisations. This further demonstrates how gender stereotypes influence our expectations of leaders and their organisations.\u201d\n\nMontgomery and Cowen believe their findings may have implications for leaders\u2019 career outcomes.\n\n\u201cOrganisational performance affects how leaders are evaluated, how they are compensated and ultimately, whether they retain their positions,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\n\u201cOur research suggests that when ethical failures occur, female leaders may aid their organisations\u2019 recovery efforts by exhibiting traits that are more consistent with male stereotypes.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.", "description": "Female CEOs are more likely to be held accountable than their male counterparts for ethical\u00a0workplace failures, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/13/girlboss-netflix.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
