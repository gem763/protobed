When Fabian clipped the top of the bar with another vicious long shot it seemed Spain would extend their lead.\n\nBut Norway would not go quietly. King raced away but shot over. He then drew a foul from Ramos that was punished with a yellow card my referee Oliver. The caution rules him out of Spain\u2019s game away to Sweden on Tuesday.\n\nSpain manager Robert Moreno watches the action from the dugout at Ullevaal Stadion\n\nOliver had allowed play to continue and Raul Albiol had blocked King, appearing to handle in the process, but Oliver ruled away appeals for a penalty before pulling out the yellow for Ramos.\n\nFabian hit the frame of the goal again but this was far from easy for Spain. Odegaard kept probing from midfield as Norway made Robert Moreno\u2019s team suffer.\n\nThe home side left it late to get their goal but when King beat Kepa Spain had dropped their first points of Euro qualifying and Norway celebrated as if they had won the game.", "description": "PETE JENSON IN OSLO: Bournemouth's Joshua King won a point for Norway against Spain scoring a penalty against Kepa Arrizabalga after the Chelsea keeper had given away the spot-kick.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/22/19637206-0-image-a-2_1570915247061.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
