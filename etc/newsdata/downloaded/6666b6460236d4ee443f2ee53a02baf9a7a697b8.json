Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe Emmys red carpet featured several a red and pink dresses and genteel Southern men (we\u2019re looking at you, Jeremy Strong and James Van Der Beek). There weren\u2019t quite as many showstoppers as there are at, say, the Oscars or the Met Gala, but when you invite Billy Porter, you\u2019re going to get at least one good look. Fortunately, we got even more than that. There was a strong showing of feminine, glamorous, outfits that didn\u2019t bore from actresses like Mandy Moore and Vera Farmiga. And a few wild cards, too, to keep things interesting and conjure up Jesus and dominatrices. Shall we?\n\nBest Celery Impression: Greta Lee\n\nGreta Lee Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nThis iridescent green color is dreamy on Greta Lee, who is nominated for her work on Russian Doll. The puffy top and ball-gown skirt wouldn\u2019t appeal if they were attached \u2014 too much volume. The strip of skin is what makes it work. Christopher John Rogers, the designer, proved to be one of the most exciting talents to show earlier this month at New York Fashion Week. Tracee Ellis Ross wore a similar look, in magenta.\n\nBest Little White Cutout Dresses: Indya Moore and Jodie Comer\n\nFrom left: Jodie Comer Photo: John Shearer/Getty Images Indya Moore Photo: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic From left: Jodie Comer Photo: John Shearer/Getty Images Indya Moore Photo: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nMoore\u2019s barely-there dress is reminiscent of a gladiator. A bridal gladiator, if you will. Meanwhile, Comer\u2019s halter top and flowing skirt scream Marilyn Monroe. That said, the sleeves are more sleek, and more Villanelle.\n\nBest Suit: Ru Paul\n\nRu Paul Photo: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nBy and large, the men of the Emmys went with basic, dark-colored tuxedos. It\u2019s a formula that works, but it\u2019s rarely landing you on any best-dressed lists. But Ru Paul took a risk that paid off. The pink suit with a black floral print and a pussy-bow blouse is something we\u2019d wear ourselves.\n\nMost Vampiric: Vera Farmiga\n\nVera Farmiga Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nMiss Havisham meets Carrie. The sleeves, the shoulders, and the neckline all read very Victorian, but the blood-red hue makes it modern without sacrificing the Gothic vibe. Farmiga is no stranger to this kind of eeriness, being that she\u2019s well known for her roles in celebrated horror films. With a blunt bob, it\u2019s a win. A bun would have been too much.\n\nBest Bows: Dascha Polanco\n\nDascha Polanco Photo: John Shearer/Getty Images\n\nSometimes you\u2019ve got to go big. While I don\u2019t think the extra tulle bow in the back is really working, the giant bows, the fitted silhouette, the neckline, and the kicky pony all look like something Barbie would wear. And what would an award-show red carpet be without a little bit of pageantry? This risk is 100 percent welcome.\n\nMaster of the Trend: Mandy Moore\n\nMandy Moore Photo: (C)Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nAt the Oscars everyone wore big pink dresses, but today we graduated to pink and red. Marisa Tomei, Zoe Kazan, and Taraji P. Henson each wore variations on the budding trend, but Moore\u2019s Brandon Maxwell gown was the standout. Her voluminous hair, elegant neckline, and figure-hugging silhouette are Old Hollywood in the best way. The vivid, contrasting colors together become simultaneously romantic and attention-grabbing. And it all looks extremely expensive.\n\nMost True to Character: Gwendoline Christie and Catherine O\u2019Hara\n\nFrom left: Gwendoline Christie Photo: John Shearer/Getty Images Catherine O\u2019Hara Photo: John Shearer/Getty Images From left: Gwendoline Christie Photo: John Shearer/Getty Images Catherine O\u2019Hara Photo: John Shearer/Getty Images\n\nGwendoline Christie\u2019s look was unlike anything else on the red carpet. It\u2019s been compared to Jesus, the Pope, and an unspecified Roman Emperor. Still, it doesn\u2019t look too costume-y. Part of that is owed to the beachy waves and red lip. Eagle-eyed Game of Thrones fans will notice that her brooch is a lion, a possible reference to the Lannister sigil. Catherine O\u2019Hara also used her red carpet moment to nod to her on-screen character, Moira Rose. Rose wears exclusively black and white on Schitt\u2019s Creek. Referential or not, O\u2019Hara\u2019s mod gown by Greta Constantine is fabulous in its own right.\n\nBest Birthday Suit: Billy Porter\n\nBilly Porter Photo: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nYou knew Billy Porter wouldn\u2019t let you down, right? Today\u2019s ceremony coincided with the actor\u2019s 50th birthday, so it\u2019s only right that Porter was adorned in 100,000 crystals. This sparkly pinstripe suit is a bit like David Bowie\u2019s famous wide-legged jumpsuit, and the peep-toe platforms seal the deal. But let\u2019s look at the hat, which is like a cubist cowboy hat, also adorned with crystals. On a night when the menswear failed to inspire, Porter was characteristically a breath of fresh air.\n\nProm Queen: Sophie Turner\n\nSophie Turner Photo: (C)Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nSophie Turner almost always wears Louis Vuitton for special occasions (she\u2019s a face for the brand). There\u2019s something about this looks that reminds me of the bitchiest girl in your high school, the Regina George all grown up and in 2019. That\u2019s know a knock, though. It\u2019s powerful, sleek, and razor sharp.\n\nBest Cape: Angela Bassett\n\nAngela Bassett Photo: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nIt\u2019s a jumpsuit! It\u2019s a cape! It\u2019s a sparkly lollipop bag! There\u2019s no shortage of great details to latch onto in Angela Bassett\u2019s outfit.\n\nSexiest: Zendaya\n\nZendaya Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nIf there\u2019s any look from tonight that\u2019s going to end up in red carpet lore, I\u2019m betting on Zendaya\u2019s emerald green Vera Wang gown. Euphoria won\u2019t be eligible for Emmy nominations until next year, but she still came to show us what we have to look forward to. The corsetry, the draping, the leg slit \u2013 it\u2019s all gorgeous. And I love how relatively simple the accessories are. The diamond bangle is the exclamation point on an incredible dress that for the most part speaks for itself.\n\nBest Variation on a Theme: Kendall Jenner\n\nKendall Jenner. Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nRemember Rachel Weisz\u2019s great latex and lace oscar look? This has a similar look. The top is BDSM and the bottom is Gone with the Wind. That juxtaposition is interesting on Jenner, who typically sticks to classically sexy red carpet attire.", "description": "The best and worst looks from the 2019 Emmys, including Mandy Moore, Zendaya, Billy Porter, and more.", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/22/22-emmys-best-looks-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
