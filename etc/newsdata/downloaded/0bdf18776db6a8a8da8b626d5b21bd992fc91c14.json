When he was angry. And never \"Hello Sven, how are you?\" It was \"whuurssshhhh\" [straight into yelling]. I thought he should kill me. He said, \"I will kill you. You are finished.\" But I represented England and you have to stand up.\n\n'What\u2019s right is right and what\u2019s wrong is wrong and when you say \"Don\u2019t pick Rooney because I\u2019m going to kill you\" . . . I said, \"F*** off, what\u2019s going on with you?\"\n\nRooney was rushed back to fitness and included in England's squad for the 2006 World Cup\n\nFerguson was so furious with Eriksson's decision he threatened to 'kill' him during the row\n\n'And he was screaming. Whenever he got like that... it has no meaning. That\u2019s why I was, \"Alex, I will pick Rooney. Now, have a nice holiday. Ciao, bye.\"'\n\nBut Rooney never looked quite right during the tournament and failed to score a single goal during England's run to the quarter-finals.\n\nRooney and England's collective misery was compounded after he saw red against Portugal, who then went on to win 3-1 on penalties to advance to the semi-finals.\n\nEriksson left his role as England manager after the disappointing tournament and was replaced by his assistant Steve McClaren.\n\nRooney played poorly during the tournament and was sent off against Portugal in quarter-final", "description": "Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has lifted the lid on his extraordinary bust-up with Sir Alex Ferguson after including an injured Wayne Rooney in his 2006 World Cup squad.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/12/19652298-0-image-a-27_1570964555283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
