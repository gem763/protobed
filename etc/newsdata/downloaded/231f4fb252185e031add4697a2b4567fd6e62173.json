Indeed, in living memory, it is an unparalleled embarrassment for a serving premier\n\nSo from his hotel in New York, where he attended the UN Climate Change summit, the Prime Minister might have smirked mirthlessly on hearing the devastating verdict.\n\nIn an historic and unprecedented ruling, 11 justices on Britain\u2019s highest court delivered him a deeply damaging blow. Citing edicts dating back more than 500 years, they said his attempt to suspend Parliament for five weeks before holding a Queen\u2019s Speech on October 14 was \u2018unlawful\u2019.\n\nHe was guilty of \u2018frustrating or preventing\u2019 parliamentary democracy. And they decreed the controversial prorogation \u2018void\u2019 \u2013 meaning MPs can resume sitting. The only silver lining to this pitch-black judicial cloud was that the court did not accuse him of lying to the monarch.\n\nCharacteristically, Mr Johnson came out fighting, saying he \u2018strongly disagreed\u2019 with the judgment \u2013 and, rightly, that he would not resign.\n\nBut make no mistake, this is a catastrophic defeat. Indeed, in living memory, it is an unparalleled embarrassment for a serving premier.\n\nOf course, prorogation is, typically, an entirely normal procedure \u2013 especially when a new administration takes power. Mr Johnson argued that he wanted a Queen\u2019s Speech to parade his gleaming domestic policy agenda \u2013 on crime, schools, social care and the NHS \u2013 while reminding voters about the terrifying danger to jobs and the economy of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s insane socialist manifesto.\n\nMoreover, the current rancorous, dysfunctional Parliament has sat for longer than any since King Charles I. And don\u2019t forget, Labour and the Liberal Democrats had been screaming blue murder for an election (until \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 it no longer suited them).\n\nCould the bull in a china shop tactics deployed by Mr Johnson \u2013 egged on by his boorish, nihilistic aide de camp Dominic Cummings \u2013 have backfired any more spectacularly? It\u2019s very doubtful.\n\nThe architect of his own downfall, he has found himself tripped and trapped. Yet the hard truth is, he had next to nothing to achieve by suspending Parliament \u2013 and everything to lose.\n\nInstead of being wrong-footed by news of the prorogation, a Remain alliance \u2013 aided and abetted by Tory rebels and a vainglorious and partisan Speaker \u2013 egregiously tore up centuries of Commons procedure (side note: how curious they didn\u2019t holler \u2018constitutional outrage\u2019 then!) to block a No Deal Brexit. Rapier-like, they skewered No 10\u2019s main bargaining chip in negotiations with the EU \u2013 the threat of walking away on October 31.\n\nMoreover, the current rancorous, dysfunctional Parliament has sat for longer than any since King Charles I\n\nMr Johnson had hoped his robust tactics would drag Michel Barnier, Jean-Claude Juncker and their chums back to the table to make concessions, including scrapping the deeply unpopular Irish backstop.\n\nBut following the Supreme Court judgment, Brussels can scent blood in the water. Aware that the PM is badly (although not fatally) wounded, why should the EU budge an inch during future talks? Rather than throw Boris any crumbs of comfort, European leaders can sit back and twiddle their thumbs in the hope he will cave in, ditch his \u2018do or die\u2019 promise to deliver Brexit by Halloween and demeaningly grovel for an extension to our membership.\n\nIt is inescapable that the Prime Minister has been an architect in his downfall. But the only one? We respectfully suggest not.\n\nOf course, this paper fully accepts \u2013 and respects \u2013 the rule of law. We believe an independent judiciary is the friend of a strong Constitution. And the Supreme Court has spoken decisively. But on this case, others found differently. A fortnight ago in the High Court, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett \u2013 the most senior judge in England and Wales \u2013 ruled it was a political, rather than legal, matter.\n\nWhy, not long ago it would have seemed unthinkable for any UK court to rule on the Prime Minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to prorogue Parliament.\n\nIf ministers misused this power, they could be brought to heel by other MPs in a confidence motion or voters in a general election. But since politicians handed the courts new powers \u2013 including Tony Blair bringing in the loathed Human Rights Act \u2013 there have been simmering concerns about judicial mission creep.\n\nWhether the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment was constitutionally appropriate, only history will decide.\n\nErudite and impeccably neutral, Baroness Hale, the president, took great care to emphasise yesterday\u2019s ruling was not about Brexit. Undoubtedly, she\u2019s right. And no one suggests for a second that the Supreme Court acted out of political animus. But the two are inextricably linked.\n\nThe case was a victory for lavishly financed Remainers, including gloating investment manager Gina Miller and thin-skinned ex-PM Sir John Major (who once prorogued Parliament to avoid a cash-for-questions scandal). Having failed to win at the ballot box, they have resorted to the courts.\n\nMr Johnson wanted his Queen's Speech to remind voters about the terrifying danger to jobs and the economy of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s insane socialist manifesto\n\nMany of the 17.4million who voted Leave three long years ago \u2013 giving the largest mandate in our history \u2013 could be forgiven for wondering what it will take for the democratic will to be honoured. With courage and ambition, they said precisely what they wanted: To cast off the sclerotic bloc\u2019s shackles and stride out into the world.\n\nNow, from Barnsley to Bishop Auckland, they are receiving the message that their precious vote \u2013 their voice, no less! \u2013 is not worth the paper on which they wrote their \u2018X\u2019, trampled into the dirt to thwart Brexit at all cost. They are not fools. They know who the main culprits are: Our out-of-touch, elitist Parliament.\n\nNever let it be forgotten that, by a thumping majority of six to one, Government and Opposition MPs voted to back a referendum. Next, MPs overwhelmingly voted to trigger Article 50 \u2013 the legal instrument for our departure. Since then, however, these pitiful politicians have leapt through every possible procedural hoop to frustrate the explicit desire of the electorate.\n\nA motley mixture of incompetent MPs, masochistically intransigent Eurosceptic zealots, treacherous Remainers and a supercilious Speaker have conspired to block Brexit.\n\nThey are the most blatant constitutional vandals!\n\nToday, they will troop back to the Commons. But what will they possibly achieve? They\u2019ve already tied Mr Johnson\u2019s hands by scuppering No Deal. And they stubbornly refuse to coalesce around a single plan to leave the EU.\n\nWhat most MPs really want, of course, is that there should be no real Brexit at all. Unfortunately, they are too spineless to say it.\n\nSo Parliament remains in interminable paralysis \u2013 and furious, exasperated voters, justifiably, wish a plague on all their houses.\n\nThe nation is crying out for resolution. Moderate, pragmatic people are sick and tired of the tawdry self-indulgence of Westminster.\n\nYesterday, Mr Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were among a caterwaul calling for Mr Johnson to resign. There is a simple remedy: Pass a vote of no confidence in him and there can be an election.\n\nBut they obstinately refuse. So far, they are running scared \u2013 terrified of Boris\u2019 popularity and determination to deliver Brexit. But the sooner this zombie Parliament is put out of its misery, the better.\n\nThe Mail believes it is a democratic disgrace that an election is being prevented. Britain desperately needs a chance to give its views, so we can move beyond the whole Brexit maelstrom. With a little luck, we can then put this tortuous saga behind us and focus on the future.", "description": "Make no mistake, this is a catastrophic defeat.
