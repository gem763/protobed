His pitch to voters includes further increases to pensions and the minimum wage.\n\nSpaniards head to the polls on Nov. 10 after Sanchez\u2019s efforts over the summer to forge a new government came to nothing over his refusal to allow the anti-austerity party Podemos to join his Socialists in a coalition.\n\nEven so, the prospect of a new election -- the fourth in four years -- is focusing the minds of Sanchez\u2019s political rivals. Albert Rivera, the leader of the center-right Ciudadanos party, signaled over the weekend he might be open to talks with Sanchez while Pablo Casado, leader of the conservative People\u2019s Party told El Mundo newspaper he might consider pacts with \u201chistorical rivals\u201d such as the Socialists.\n\nSpain needs a coherent government as it faces down threats including the response in Catalonia to a verdict due in coming days on the case of jailed pro-independence Catalan leaders. Other challenges include a potential hard Brexit, and the consequences of a cooling economy amid international trade disputes.\n\nSanchez said the Socialists\u2019 full electoral programs will be unveiled in coming weeks. Listed below are some of the 35 \u201csocial commitments,\u201d he unveiled in Madrid on Monday:\n\nPeg pensions to the consumer price indexIncrease minimum wage to reach 60% of the average wage by the end of his next mandateRoll back the most \u201charmful\u201d parts of the labor market reform passed by the PP government in 2012Improve housing opportunities for young peopleCreate a watchdog to protect banking costumersMake Spain\u2019s tax system more progressive\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Gualtieri in Madrid at tgualtieri@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Charles Penty at cpenty@bloomberg.net, Ben Sills\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez painted himself as the voice of moderation in Spanish politics as the country braces for an election campaign in the shadow of forthcoming verdicts in a trial of Catalan separatists and international disputes over trade and Brexit.\u201cI humbly ask people", "authors": ["Thomas Gualtieri"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gB.AhYK7FKilTTSMv6rsUQ--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/73e7ae336c0aedfd34371b4f39759c62", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
