Magazine from 2000, Mary said that Freddie made the decision to stop medicating himself and how this had an immediate effect.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMary said: \"It was Freddie's decision to finally end it all. He chose the time to die.\n\n\u201cHe knew it was coming. The quality of his life had changed so dramatically and he was in more pain every day.\"\n\nMary recalled that this brought on a number of complications as Freddie's health nosedived.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe continued: \"He was losing his sight. His body became weaker as he suffered mild fits.\n\n\u201cIt was so distressing to see him deteriorating in this way. One day he decided enough was enough and stopped all the medical supplements that were keeping him going.\u201d\n\nMary said that she was 'overwhelmed' at how Freddie looked death in the eye and his bravery at that point.\n\n(Image: EX)\n\nRecalling that time, she said: \"He looked death in the face and said, \u2018Fine, I'll accept it now - I'll go.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut it was peaceful and he died with a smile on his face.\u201d\n\nFreddie ensured that Mary was taken care of financially after he was gone, leaving her the mansion and future sales of Queen songs but she said that it took her a long time to come to terms with his passing.\n\n(Image: Alan Davidson/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nShe remembered: \"Suddenly, there wasn't anyone to help me.\n\n\u201cIt made me realise that I wasn't as self-sufficient as I would have liked to have been.\n\n\u201cHe was always very protective of me. I only realised, after he died, quite how protective he'd been.\n\n(Image: Richard Young/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\u201cIf something happened, he'd say, \u2018Oh darling, don't worry - we'll get over that. He was uplifting.\"\n\nThere were moments though, when Freddie's vulnerability meant that he struggled.\n\nShe continued: \"At other times, when he was aware he had AIDS and only had a limited time to live, there'd be the odd serious conversation when he'd say to me, \u2018Let's go and sit, we don't know how long we have.\u2019\u201d\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
