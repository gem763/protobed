He had also led the India U-19 cricket team to World Cup triumph.\n\nA player of high quality - with the fluid footwork and crafty shot making, it wasn\u2019t long before he made his bow for India.\n\nAFP\n\nHis debut for India was not only memorable but historic too, as he became the youngest Indian cricketer to score a Test century on debut.\n\nDon't Miss 1 K SHARES 497 SHARES 357 SHARES 135 SHARES\n\nThe promise and growing repute that he had shown in domestic circuit was no fluke, as Prithvi Shaw announced himself in some style in international cricket - he was pleasing on the eye and oozing class.\n\nIn his first innings on the big stage, the Thane native showed exactly why he is rated so highly and talked about as the next big thing in Indian cricket.\n\nBCCI\n\nIn the two Test match series, Prithvi Shaw piled on 234 runs at an average of 118.50, with one hundred and a fifty. He was also adjudged man of the series for his superlative efforts.\n\nHe had answered the clarion call of selectors and Indian team with a terrific showing against West Indies.\n\nAfter a sensational start to his Test career, Prithvi Shaw was expected to capitalise and make the opening slot his own. But not only has that not happened, he has has to deal with injuries and a doping ban.\n\nYouTube\n\nOne year is a lot of time in cricket and Prithvi Shaw knows it more than anyone else. The rising star of Indian cricket is now facing an uncertain international future and is serving a 8 month dipping ban.\n\nAfter suffering a hip injury and missing the action, Shaw had missed selection after his debut series. He was undergoing rehabilitation for his hip injury, but the worse was yet to come.\n\nIn July this year, the 19 year-old was handed a doping ban by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after he had tested positive for terbutaline during the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament.\n\nIt came as a big set back to the dashing opener who was getting back to being fit and works his way back into the Indian side. The 19 year-old was given a ban in July, but he had tested positive few months back and his suspension had already begun in March.\n\nAFP\n\nBut BCCI only made it official in July and Shaw's period of suspension stands eight months, starting from March 16 to November 15, effectively ruling him out of India's home season. It has been a year since Prithvi Shaw's debut, but things have begun to unravel for him - it has been a downward spiral.\n\nIn a career that started so brightly, Shaw is in state of desolation and disarray. All is not lost though, he is only 19 and he ban ends next month. Having been seen as a lot term solution for the opening slot, the fight is their for Shaw to win.\n\nBCCI He no doubt will be disappointed and a doping ban will have effected him mentally and it won't be an easy road back to where he belongs - Indian Test side. With age on his side, there's no reason why Shaw can't fulfil his undeniable potential and have a great career.\n\nHe will get back, that's what people with huge temperament and attitude do. He needs to get back at it, and let his bat do the talking.", "description": "When 18 year-old Prithvi Shaw made his debut last year against West Indies, he came with the reputation of being one of the best young batsman in India.
