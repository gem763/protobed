I went diving and the marine life is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nEarliest holiday memory?\n\nDriving to Betws-y-coed, North Wales, in my father\u2019s Hillman Imp. We\u2019d put on our boots and head for the mountains.\n\nIdeal travel companion?\n\nMy darling wife Louise \u2014 we\u2019ve been together nearly ten years.\n\nFavourite hotel?\n\nThe Four Seasons in Hampshire \u2014 we often go there for a good chill-out.\n\nTips for travelling with kids?\n\nDon\u2019t take young kids on long journeys. Once they\u2019re past seven, it gets easier, if there are plenty of activities.\n\nYour idea of holiday hell?\n\nStaying anywhere where the service is bad and the staff are rude.\n\nRussell says his favourite holiday was to Bora Bora, in the South Pacific, pictured\n\nWhat can't you travel without?\n\nMy tennis racquet. If I find out that a hotel hasn\u2019t got a tennis court before I go, I\u2019ll usually book somewhere else.\n\nWhere next?\n\nI\u2019d love to go back to Bora Bora again but Louise won\u2019t do long-distance flights, so it will probably be somewhere closer to home like Vienna.\n\nDream destination?\n\nHorseback riding across the plains of America.", "description": "Singer Russell Watson talks about his earliest holiday memories in Wales, tips for travelling with kids and the one thing he can't travel without...", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/20/21/18736614-0-image-a-74_1569011075776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
