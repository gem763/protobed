But in the year-and-a-half between vanishing from public life and reappearing in court, this 72-year-old had lost his jet black hair and become stooped and haggard.\n\nNow he was the target of the Orwellian security system he himself had built. And he knew better than to resist.\n\n\u201cI accept the sentence. I will not appeal. I realise the crimes I\u2019ve committed and what I\u2019ve cost the Party.\u201d\n\nWhen Xi Jinping came to power, he had promised the public a campaign which would \u201cbrandish the sword against corruption\u201d, caging tigers as well as trapping flies.\n\nHere was one of the biggest tigers of all. Zhou Yongkang was the most senior Party official ever to stand trial for corruption in the history of communist China.\n\nA commentary on state TV news proclaimed: \u201cNo-one is above the law. This case shows that our country is practising the rule of law and our Party is determined to eradicate corruption.\u201d\n\nThe downfall of another tiger \u2013 Bo Xilai \u2013 is now notorious. He and Zhou were accused of plotting together and, with two top military figures and another senior politician, of \u201cwrecking Party unity\u201d.\n\nZhou\u2019s trial came halfway through Xi\u2019s first term. The campaign of shock and awe was well under way with a barrage of high-profile trials and a drumbeat of righteous propaganda.\n\nTo supplement the image of a newly disciplined and frugal political culture, Xi tried to avoid banquets and sometimes travelled in a van with colleagues instead of a fleet of limousines.", "description": "Xi Jinping is tightening his grip on power.
