But Elaaaaaine, you\u2019re just too needy, DeSean protests. Who has the energy?\n\nSarah and Lauren, her trans wife of two years, always had a plan for when they were going to have kids. But Sarah has upped her timeline to, well, right-now-this-very-second, and it\u2019s exposing all the cracks in their relationship.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started about Evelyn and Alan, who six years into marriage have some of the most egregious trust issues I\u2019ve ever seen and quite frankly, Evelyn, you don\u2019t seem to like him very much anyway.\n\nNearly an entire box of crackers and intense dairy indigestion later, I was living my nosy-bitch fantasy.\n\nLast Friday, timed with the premiere episode\u2019s debut, Showtime had made the entire series of Couples Therapy available for bingeing on-demand and on the Showtime streaming platforms.\n\nFor four-and-a-half hours, I watched these couples bitterly fight, cry, make up, weep, accuse, betray, confess, connect, sob, shout, laugh, reminisce, and put it all on the line\u2014as in their marriages\u2014in raw, very real therapy sessions.\n\nGuiding them through was Dr. Orna Guralnik, a New York City-based clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst. With her permanently perched eyebrows, unplaceable accent, and lean, incessantly folded frame, Dr. Guralnik could not be more perfectly cast. Her expressive hands, God\u2019s Gifts to Gesticulation, swirl through the air, gestures that complete leading, half-finished sentences\u2014\u201cAnd that made you feel\u2026\u201d\u2014in fantastic therapist-y fashion.\n\nBut Dr. Guralnik isn\u2019t \u201ccast\u201d in the way we normally associate that word, nor are the couples baring their deepest, darkest truths to her. She is a real therapist, and they couples really seeking help.\n\nCouples Therapy is a voyeur\u2019s dream, extreme titillation for anyone who has never met a closed door they didn\u2019t want to go directly behind. I am obsessed, and, gauging by social media comments from those who have also discovered Couples Therapy, so are a lot of people. You\u2019re about to be, as well. So we had a little therapy session of our own, with filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg (Weiner), who created the show with Eli Despres, to talk about why it\u2019s all so fascinating.\n\nFirst on the agenda: How uncomfortable should we feel while watching? It\u2019s juicy stuff. But it\u2019s all so intimate and ugly, kind of making your skin crawl. Within 15 seconds of meeting each couple, you demand they break up. By the end of each episode, you want these crazy kids to figure it out and make a hearty go of it. It\u2019s... a lot!\n\n\u201cPeople are going to have a wide range of reaction to this,\u201d Kriegman says. \u201cThese are real people who are struggling and fighting for their relationships.\u201d Adds Steinberg, \u201cI think there is some comfort in seeing these struggles and identifying with them personally, making a connection [with the couples].\u201d\n\nSeeds of the idea for the series sprouted when the duo was working on Weiner, the 2016 documentary chronicling disgraced former politician Anthony Weiner\u2019s New York City mayoral campaign, and what it all said about politics, sex, media, and, most fascinating to armchair looky-loos like me, his marriage to political operative Huma Abedin. We had all wondered, despite it not being any of our damn business: How could she stay with him?\n\n\u201cWhat was going on there was more nuanced than it appeared in the headlines,\u201d Kriegman says. \u201cThe real dynamics of a relationship is always more complicated than it appears. With this show, you get to see the relationships from the inside.\u201d\n\nBoth of Kriegman\u2019s parents are therapists. A New Yorker herself, Steinberg is very familiar with the world of therapy, but, more specifically, the reality of it, too. The way therapy had been depicted in the world and especially in pop culture and especially-especially on reality TV is sensationalized. They wanted to debunk those myths and show with authenticity the rawness of a couple going through the process.\n\nThe couples they cast have diverse backgrounds, gender and sexual identities, lengths of marriage, and certainly issues to work through. (We led with the crazy threesome anecdote, but there is some serious, rooted, painful stuff going on here.) The key was that they were already in the market for therapy before there was an opportunity to be filmed while doing it. In a genre of television where people tend to play things up for the cameras and what \u201creal\u201d actually means is a heightened version of real, that these couples would be honest and authentic was the biggest concern.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s rare to check in with couples who are years, even decades, into their own connection, which breeds its own, lived-in authenticity. \u201d\n\nFrom a production standpoint, that meant creating an environment that felt like an actual therapist\u2019s office. Cameras were concealed behind one-way glass, so that the couples wouldn\u2019t be distracted by having equipment in their faces. The result is that they would arrive at the waiting room, have their one-hour sessions, and leave without having ever interacted with production or seeing a camera.\n\nCouples Therapy, then, also doesn\u2019t have the look or feel of other reality and documentary series we\u2019ve become familiar with that explore love and relationships. There are no confessionals recapping drama or used to narrate how characters actually feel. Nothing seems as nakedly manufactured or produced as the reality, so to speak, of reality TV.\n\nAnd at a time when you can\u2019t change the channel without landing on a \u201cnon-fiction\u201d series chronicling first dates and bachelors and bachelorettes and love on islands and seeking perfect matches or whatever a 90-day fianc\u00e9 is, this show stands out. It\u2019s rare to check in with couples who are years, even decades, into their own connection, which breeds its own, lived-in authenticity.\n\n\u201cRight now, we see a lot of curated versions of people on social media,\u201d Steinberg says. \u201cI think what we\u2019re not talking about is the inner lives of the struggles we\u2019re going through. Our hope is that this series can provide a reality check, that our struggles are all human and universal.\u201d\n\nIt goes without saying that Couples Therapy is addicting. You shout at the TV. Elaine, what are you doing? You\u2019re not happy! Next minute, it\u2019s DeSean you\u2019re rooting for. You\u2019re rooting for them both, actually. At the ugliest moments, that means rooting for them to break up, too.\n\nKriegman and Steinberg are right. You do relate to their issues. You do see your struggles in their struggles. You do glare over at your partner sitting on the other side of the couch, recognizing that the beginnings of the same issues you\u2019re seeing on screen are starting to fester in your own relationship. Horrifying!\n\nMostly, the series ends and you\u2019re desperate to find each and every one of them and find out where they are now on their journeys, how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cOne of the things about our culture right now is that we\u2019re inundated with stories of conflict and polarization,\u201d Kriegman says. \u201cThe dominant narrative is one of people entrenched in their corners, digging their heels in, and really bracing for a fight. We were excited with this series to tell a different story. There may be some discomfort in watching. But ultimately these are stories of love and compassion and empathy.\u201d", "description": "Filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg break down the juiciest, most addicting show on TV: Showtime\u2019s voyeuristic look inside real couples\u2019 brutal therapy sessions.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568608341/unnamed_16_bwcf4o", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
