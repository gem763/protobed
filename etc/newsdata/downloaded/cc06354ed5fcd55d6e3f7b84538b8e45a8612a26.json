If we could hit that, and even surpass that . . . ah, one can dream. But then with such wonderful supporters as these, why shouldn\u2019t we?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Larry kindly gives NR $100 and expresses a sentiment that reflects that of many others: \u201cI have come to appreciate your journalistic stance against the political and economic extremes that those of a socialist mindset endeavor to create in our great republic. Keep going.\u201d\n\n\u2022 In line with that is Carl, who also drops $100 into the collection basket, and a common sentiment: \u201cI thank you for your diversity of conservative thought; it is refreshing that we can disagree without rancor among ourselves; that we remain respectful of those with whom we may have disagreements. We all share the same basic philosophy and that keeps us united. Thank you, National Review.\u201d Back at you, and double!\n\n\u2022 Another $100, this time from Robert, who pats our back: \u201cThanks for the thoughtful and always well-written arguments and analyses. Our society desperately needs your voices, and I\u2019m glad to contribute my little bit to that worthy cause.\u201d Nothing little about this. Thanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Sammy does likewise because he digs the Apostle Kat: \u201cBecause of all the great writers and the audience this magazine reaches. In particular, Kat Timpf and the other writers bringing the message to the millennial generation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Daniel was moved to donate $400 thusly: \u201cIn response to Rich Lowry\u2019s request to support the excellent work of Alexandra DeSanctis and your other fine writers on the issue of abortion.\u201d Humbled by this.\n\n\u2022 Natalie gives $50 and admits to a dark secret: \u201cI enjoy Fowler.\u201d A very acquired taste.\n\n\u2022 John spots us $25 and for good reason: \u201cNR is a world class force for free speech and journalistic integrity.\u201d Thanks for having our back in this fight.\n\n\u2022 Maxim sends $100 and shares an important personal warning: \u201cI grew up in the Soviet Union and have seen first-hand the devastating effect of communism on a nation. Most troublesome is not the economic impact on the standards of living, but the moral decay, apathy, and cynicism that traps its citizens. I came here hoping that my kids will never get to experience this kind of life. Please accept this modest contribution to help spread the word of common sense and freedom.\u201d Love this! Thanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Pavel puts $50 into the tip cup and gives a hint as to how much NR has meant to so many, the world over: \u201cReading the NR since 1965. At that time it was only available at the U.S. Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Robin tenders 200 smackers and gives thanks to NR\u2019s ever-thereness: \u201cAfter three decades out of college, living in South America and befriending many expats, I returned to NR as to a lighthouse from the rough seas!\u201d We bet you saw Bill Buckley sailing them!\n\n\u2022 Len sends a grand. Yeah, $1,000. And get this: \u201cNational Review is an essential institution. I am honored that I am allowed and respected for commenting here. To me it\u2019s just showing the flag. To the people who are stationed at this defensive redoubt against the barbarism of hijacked solidarity, I offer this humble donation because your efforts are worth it, and because I can.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Ditto: Chris makes with the $1,000 gift. Zounds! \u201cFrom J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings: \u2018What can man do against so much reckless hate?\u2019 \u2018Contribute to National Review!\u2019 (Actually, Aragorn said, \u2018Ride out with me,\u2019 but we all know what he meant.)\u201d Hoping everyone follows your inspiration and makes donating to NR a regular . . . hobbit.\n\n\u2022 Wow, wow, wow: Cynthia. Five Grand. Wow again. It comes with orders: \u201cKeep up the good work. Please stay civil, decent, and open-minded! I sincerely appreciate the range of conservative opinion in National Review.\u201d We don\u2019t doubt that, but your appreciation cannot come close to ours. Thanks.\n\n\u2022 Pavel puts $50 into the tip cup and gives a hint as to how much NR has meant to so many, the world over: \u201cReading the NR since 1965. At that time it was only available at the US Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.\u201d\n\nWe hope these good people, just a handful of the 1,300 who has so far responded to our appeals, will inspire another 1,300 to do likewise in these final days. Please give what you can, knowing that we know your (deeply appreciated!) generosity is selfless. Help us reach, and even surpass, our goal of $175,000 by donating to the 2019 Spring Webathon here. If you wish to send a check, here\u2019s the drill: Make it payable to \u201cNational Review\u201d and mail it to National Review, ATTN: Spring 2019 Webathon, 19 West 44th Street, New York, NY 10036. Thank you very much.", "description": "NR\u2019s 2019 Spring Webathon now enters the last few days still some $25,000 short of its $175,000 goal.
