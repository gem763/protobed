This Game 4 loss was marked by generating few opportunities at all. Washington loaded the bases with one out in the sixth and could only score a run. Juan Soto plated it by chopping out to first. Howie Kendrick followed with an inning-ending strikeout. And in the next half, with everything slipping, Alex Bregman crushed a grand slam off Fernando Rodney. Cheers boomed out of three sections dotting the stadium. They were all filled with Astros fans. The rest of the crowd was quiet, stewing, stacking patience against their sinking guts.\n\nAD\n\nAnd their silence was loud.\n\nThis weekend began with a line of kids walking through the Navy Yard, just a block from the stadium, chanting \u201cGo! \u2026 Nats! \u2026 Go!\u201d on a cool morning. Nationals banners hung from porches and in storefronts. Nationals talk \u2014 lathered in optimism, lacking the restraint of past falls \u2014 blared through car radios and restaurant TVs. The city\u2019s hosting its first World Series since 1933. That was evident. Then 43,876 people came to see what lies beyond imagination.\n\nAD\n\nBut then the Astros took two days to dent the Nationals\u2019 runaway faith. Washington had won eight straight, going back to the Oct. 7, before Houston had its way against An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and the offense flatlined in Game 3. The Nationals went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position. They were sloppy in the field, making two errors, and it all gave Houston a second life. Saturday became a pivotal turning point.\n\nAD\n\nThe on-paper strategy once favored the Nationals, at least before a pitch was thrown. Corbin is a front-line lefty who signed for $140 million last winter. The Astros turned to Jos\u00e9 Urquidy to kick off a bullpen game. They lack a definitive fourth starter. So after Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke go, they lean on a mash-up of relievers to give their bats a chance. It was always the one contest Washington would be favored in. They just had to turn logic into results.\n\nYet Urquidy was dominant, throwing five scoreless innings, while Corbin couldn\u2019t hold the Astros down. Corbin was tagged for two runs in the top of the first, on four straight hits, and his pitch count spiked up to 26. The Astros turned two get-me-over sinkers into singles. He couldn\u2019t locate his slider, his best pitch, and slipped again when Robinson Chirinos lifted a two-run shot off him in the fourth.\n\nAD\n\nIt was Chirinos who bounced into a double play to help Corbin escape the first. Before that at-bat, with Corbin struggling, pitching coach Paul Menhart walked to the mound for a short conference. Corbin followed by throwing two change-ups to Chrinos, a pitch he typically uses just 5 percent of the time, and soon retired him with an inside sinker. So, in their second matchup, Corbin attacked Chirinos with his ninth change-up of the outing. It fluttered into the middle of the zone, like a one-winged bird, looking ready to be swatted. Then it flew high over the stadium and landed deep in the left-field seats.\n\nAD\n\nChrinos slapped his chest while skipping toward home plate. Corbin stood by the mound, some 60 feet away, his shoulders slumped and his face blank. He is known for handling big moments with a personality that doesn\u2019t even quiver. But that\u2019s been absent for four of his seven playoff appearances. He is the first player in history to make three starts and four relief appearances in the same postseason. If his arm is tiring, and the workload is too big, he\u2019d likely never say. It just lengthens the list of problems Washington has to solve. And fast.\n\nRotation depth was supposed to separate the Nationals in this series. The offense charged back-to-back wins to begin the series in Houston. But Corbin wilted, the offense did, too, and the Astros widened the gap when Tanner Rainey and Fernando Rodney shrank in the seventh inning. Manager Dave Martinez turned to Rainey, then Rodney, to hold a three-run deficit in place. He had Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson sitting in the bullpen after two full days of rest. The decision backfired when Rainey couldn\u2019t find the strike zone, Rodney couldn\u2019t avoid hard contact, and, after Bregman\u2019s blast and five walks in the inning, the deficit ballooned.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals have scored just twice through 18 innings in their own ballpark. They are 1 for 19 with runners in scoring position across those two games. The lone hit did not even score a run. They are picking the worst time to dig up old habits \u2014 a lifeless bullpen, poor situational hitting, caving in October \u2014 and will now face Cole, Verlander and, maybe, Greinke with their title shot back in the balance.\n\nAD\n\nTheir saving grace is that Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg will be on the mound for the next two games. The only way to swallow Saturday was to remember, somehow, that the Astros did all this to catch up.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInning-by-inning recap\n\nby Sam Fortier\n\nNinth inning (Astros 8, Nationals 1)\n\nOne of the loudest cheers of the night from Nationals Park after the first inning came in the ninth. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic comeback or a big home run. But Juan Soto looked, for the first time this series, like the Gold Glove-nominated left fielder he is. He lasered a throw home to beat Robinson Chirinos, who was trying to score from second on a liner into left. He made the catch to end the inning in foul ground too. It was a bright spot on what was mostly a dreary day.\n\nAD\n\nYou know what they say: a series doesn't start until a team wins at home. \ud83d\ude09 #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/1AbmBmqit7 \u2014 MLB (@MLB) October 27, 2019\n\nEighth inning (Astros 8, Nationals 1)\n\nThe eighth belonged to Javy Guerra. This should tell you all you need to know about the state of Nationals Park. Guerra pitched mop-up in the ninth inning of Game 2, allowing a solo home run, but the lead was too large for it too matter. Now you could say the same about the deficit.\n\nAD\n\nNationals Park wanted so desperately to cheer about something. When second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve made a high throw which pulled Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel off the bag and allowed Anthony Rendon to reach, what was left of the crowd \u2014 soaking in the rain \u2014 exploded. They waved their towels. They shouted. They tried to inject some life into a game their team played without any.\n\nAD\n\nNothing came of it. Juan Soto walked but he was just another stranded base runner. Howie Kendrick struck out and Ryan Zimmerman flied out to end the threat which didn\u2019t feel like much of one in the first place.\n\nSeventh inning (Astros 8, Nationals 1)\n\nHopefully you bottled some of that energy when the Nationals were crushing the Astros during that six-run seventh inning in Houston. The Astros have completely taken hold of this series, the latest example a grand slam by Alex Bregman down the left-field line that pushed the Astros\u2019 advantage to 8-1 and sent some of Nationals Park headed toward the exits.\n\nAD\n\nThe inning started auspiciously with back-to-back walks from Tanner Rainey. Then Manager Dave Martinez doubled down on the chaotic energy by relieving him with Fernando Rodney, his second-most inconsistent pitcher. Rodney allowed a quick single, then the big fly to Bregman.\n\nAD\n\nThe chaos didn\u2019t end after Bregman. Rodney walked the bases loaded. Dave Martinez came out to get Rodney and replaced him with Wander Suero who finally, mercifully, ended the seventh.\n\nThis game crawled into its third hour as the Astros made the third substitution of the inning, bringing in Brad Peacock to pitch. He navigated out of a two-on, two-out jam and not even a full-out, diving try by Trea Turner at first base to beat the tag could make a difference.\n\nSixth inning (Astros 4, Nationals 1)\n\nPatrick Corbin proved he really could settle in by retiring the side in order for the second straight inning, giving him eight straight outs. He even got Robinson Chirinos, who crushed a monster home run off him to left the at-bat before. The Nationals left-hander has cruised on this last trip through the order, but the question is whether it\u2019s too little, too late.\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019re left to forever wonder what would have happened if the Astros stuck with Jos\u00e9 Urquidy. The rookie right-hander was cruising through the best start of his career when, at 67 pitches, the Astros lifted him for Josh James.\n\nThe hard-throwing right-hander, the one who buzzed Ryan Zimmerman in Game 3, walked leadoff pinch-hitter Gerardo Parra. (\u201cBaby Shark\u201d was more restrained this time.) He struck out Trea Turner but walked Adam Eaton, so the Astros went to right-hander Will Harris.\n\nAnthony Rendon singled off Harris and loaded the bases with one out. The Nationals needed a breakthrough \u2014 bad. Juan Soto grounded out to first to drive one run home, but it didn\u2019t seem like enough. The Nationals lineup, facing someone other than Urquidy, needed to come through.\n\nThey didn\u2019t. Howie Kendrick struck out. Inning over.\n\nFifth inning (Astros 4, Nationals 0)\n\nPatrick Corbin matched Jose Urquidy by retiring the 3-4-5 hitters in order. That is a sentence which seemed impossible before the game. But the Astros rookie bullpen arm is outdueling the Nationals\u2019 six-year, $140 million ace through 4 \u00bd innings.\n\nThis is the eighth start of Jose Urquidy\u2019s career, and it\u2019s close to his best ever. Urquidy threw six shutout innings against the Los Angeles Angels in late September, but to do what he\u2019s done against this lineup \u2014 which continued with a 1-2-3 fifth \u2014 is remarkable. The rookie right-hander blew a fastball down the pipe by Ryan Zimmerman, and he popped out Victor Robles and Yan Gomes to right.\n\nFourth inning (Astros 4, Nationals 0)\n\nRobinson Chirinos crushes left-handers. His .915 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against them is an elite rate. He showed why when Patrick Corbin missed with a change-up right over the middle. Chirinos put it in the left-field seats and handed the Astros a commanding 4-0 lead.\n\nTime is a flat circle. The Nationals scored no runs. This time, the starter who was supposed to be temporary sailed through the fourth inning against the heart of the Nationals order. Jose Urquidy is dealing and at just 52 pitches.\n\nThird inning (Astros 2, Nationals 0)\n\nOther than Michael Brantley, who\u2019s off to a scorching start at the World Series, Patrick Corbin raced through the middle of the Astros lineup the second time through. Jos\u00e9 Altuve grounded out (on an impressive Anthony Rendon grab). Alex Bregman popped out. Yuli Gurriel struck out on Corbin\u2019s signature slider.\n\nYan Gomes smacked a leadoff double down the left-field line and dared the Nationals, who stranded 13 runners in Game 3, to strand another. They seemed as though they might as the next batter, Patrick Corbin, pushed a bunt back to the pitcher which didn\u2019t allow Gomes to advance. Trea Turner\u2019s groundout to first did, but it gave the Nationals a runner on third with two outs. Adam Eaton lined out to Carlos Correa in short center. RISP-y BIZNESS struck again.\n\nSecond inning (Astros 2, Nationals 0)\n\nPatrick Corbin soothed any anxiety which might have built during his rough first inning with a 1-2-3 second. He retired the 8-9-1 hitters on weak groundballs by using his change-up more than he normally does. Corbin started using the pitch more after pitching coach Paul Menhart visited him after loading the bases in the first. That\u2019s the pitch to watch with Corbin.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive thing Jose Urquidy has done so far in his short start was get Nationals second baseman Howie Kendrick to expand the zone up and strike him out to lead off the inning. Kendrick is the Nationals\u2019 third-best hitter, and he\u2019s known for being selective in his approach at the plate. But Urquidy worked him up, got Kendrick to swing at several balls out of the strike zone and beat him by scaling the ladder on his last 95-mph fastball. Soft contact from Ryan Zimmerman and no contact at all from Victor Robles finished off the second at just 24 pitches.\n\nFirst inning (Astros 2, Nationals 0)\n\nMax Scherzer praised Patrick Corbin for his ability to control the edges of the plate. The left-hander\u2019s slider has excelled at that all season, looking like a fastball all the way to the plate until it dives off the table. But the Astros ambushed Corbin early and they smacked all three pitches on the edges of the plate, all outside to each hitter, for singles. Alex Bregman delivered the game\u2019s first run and an infield single by Yuli Gurriel drove in the second.\n\nCorbin got into serious, bases-loaded, one-out trouble by walking Carlos Correa. Then he pitched Robinson Chirinos backward (change-up, slider, change-up, fastball) and got a groundball that third baseman Anthony Rendon turned into a desperately needed double play.\n\nAnthony Rendon punched a two-out single into left field but, despite that, the Nationals didn\u2019t get many good looks at Astros \u201cstarter\u201d Jose Urquidy. The rookie right-hander is the beginning of what the Astros will call \u201ca bullpen game,\u201d meaning Urquidy will yield to relievers sooner rather than later. The Astros hope for him to go about 75 pitches, which Friday night\u2019s starter Zack Greinke reached in the fourth inning, or five innings total. The Nationals didn\u2019t make much headway into denting his pitch count in the first, as he needed 11 pitches to navigate the first four batters.\n\nPregame\n\nA good sign for Washington?\n\nSoto out here practicing his bat flips during BP. #WePlayLoud pic.twitter.com/lkcEjJwPgB \u2014 MLB (@MLB) October 26, 2019\n\nThis, too.\n\nThe Nationals also received a bit of good news on catcher Kurt Suzuki, who injured his right hip flexor on Friday night.
