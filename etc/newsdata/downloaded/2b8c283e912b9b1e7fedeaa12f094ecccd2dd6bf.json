The weather agency warns that people should be on the lookout for flash floods and water accumulation on the roads.\n\nAnd yet, some 500 kilometres to the northwest in Rouyn-Noranda, 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected, but there are no plans in that community to cancel Halloween.\n\nOther municipalities outside Montreal have also postponed Halloween, including Magog, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Drummondville, Longueuil, Saint-Lambert, Sainte-Julie, Sorel-Tracy and Mont-Saint-Hilaire. Laval officials have said people can choose whether to go out trick-or-treating on either Thursday or Friday night.\n\nAvis m\u00e9t\u00e9o: j\u2019invite les petits et grands Montr\u00e9alais.e.s \u00e0 passer l\u2019<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halloween?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Halloween</a> vendredi en raison de la pluie et des vents violents annonc\u00e9s demain.

With the help of a neighbour, she went door-to-door asking everybody with a decorated house to join.\n\nShe said that's plenty for her three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter.\n\n\"It's just encouraging community and encouraging neighbours to talk to each other \u2014 human interaction that is just rare these days. Halloween should be fun,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"People that have been home have been like 'Yeah, I'm down.' So I'm excited.\"", "description": "Montreal is joining several municipalities across Quebec in urging trick-or-treaters to delay going door-to-door\u00a0for Halloween until Friday, due to\u00a0a\u00a0scary weather forecast that includes heavy rain and high winds.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5341532.1572464139!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/halloween-montreal.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
