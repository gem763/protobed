Guatemala\u2019s president-elect, Alejandro Giammattei, has criticised the deal, but Trump officials reiterated this month that the US will slash government assistance if Guatemala backs out.\n\nKevin McAleenan, who plans to step down as acting DHS secretary as soon as Thursday, has secured similar agreements with Honduras and El Salvador, but those deals have not been implemented.\n\nHe has said the agreements will be implemented gradually to avoid overwhelming Central American nations that until now have typically received few applications from those fleeing persecution.\n\nMr McAleenan has argued that vulnerable migrants should not have to travel all the way to the US to find safety and that the US immigration system has been overwhelmed in recent years amid a flood of applications from Central American economic migrants making humanitarian claims to avoid deportation.\n\nThe many critics of the accords say it is unrealistic to expect weak Central American governments to safely resettle vulnerable groups when they already struggle with widespread poverty and some of the highest homicide rates in the world.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
