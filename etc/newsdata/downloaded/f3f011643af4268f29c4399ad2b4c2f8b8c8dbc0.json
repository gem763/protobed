The tech giant has filed a patent (pictured above) this year that gives a glimpse into what it may be developing behind closed doors\n\nA recent patent application from the company suggests Apple is pursing a technology described as a 'Display Device' that uses a futuristic-sounding 'reflective holographic combiner.'\n\nApple seems to think that this holographic technology - which is apparently capable of reflecting light in one's environment - could more seamlessly blend objects rendered in the headset's display, increasing the depth-of-field and reducing the resulting eyestrain and nausea often associated with AR and VR technology.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple is currently hiring game developers and graphics designers to help pioneer the device category and even grooming the product as an potential replacement for one's iPhone.\n\nA recent research note from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a knack for correctly predicting Apple's forthcoming hardware, previously suggested the tech giant could have the glasses ready by the first half of 2020.\n\nKuo's note also forecasts that Apple will be partnering with 'third-party brands' to design the headset.\n\nLikewise Facebook has reportedly partnered with Rayban to work on its own pair of augmented reality glasses in the coming one to two years.\n\nWHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AR AND VR? Virtual reality is a computer-generated simulation of an environment or situation It immerses the user by making them feel like they are in the simulated reality throughimages and sounds For example, in VR, you could feel like you're climbing a mountain while sat at home In contrast, augmented reality layers computer-generated images on top of an existing reality AR is developed into apps to bring digital components into the real world\n\nFor example, in the Pokemon Go app, the characters seem to appear in real world scenarios\n\nBloomberg suggests that unlike Apple's headset, however, Facebook will not have augmented reality built-in, but will function similarly to Snapchat's Spetacles and work to place calls, take pictures, and more.\n\nKuo's predictions come on the heels of several other hints that Apple may be further along in its development of its first-ever AR glasses.\n\nLast month MacRumors says it saw documentation of an internal iOS 13 build for what looks like support for an augmented reality headset.\n\nThose documents showed evidence of what MacRumors reports is a mysterious 'STARTester' app which can switch to a head-mounted mode as well as code designed to run stereo-enabled AR apps that the outlet said implies the existence of a headset.\n\nDocuments also suggest that Apple may have a prototype of the device which is reportedly code-named 'Garta.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "The glasses will come with holographic lenses that will likely serve as the technical backbone of the device and bring its AR experience to life by overlaying digital displays on real life.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/22/10432470-0-image-a-19_1571693856594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
