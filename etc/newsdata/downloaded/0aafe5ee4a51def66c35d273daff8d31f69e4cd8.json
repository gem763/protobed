Is this a beat poetry thing? A nonsensical yet evocative pairing of random words, like asparagus rebel or potted moon? Inevitably, no: ear seeding is the hot new technique in wellness circles. A self-administered variant of traditional acupuncture, it takes place entirely in one\u2019s lugs, a microcosm for the whole body.\n\nI\u2019m trying out these 24-carat-gold ear seeds (Vie Healing, \u00a329 for 20) to see if they live up to their name. And I\u2019m struggling. The studs are extremely tiny, like the pips on the outside of a strawberry. Imagine trying to manipulate one of those with any precision. An accompanying auricular therapy diagram only adds to the confusion. Fifty spots are highlighted, as if I could place a seed with a specificity that targets my spleen and avoids my lung. (I\u2019m happy to get it in at all, but please don\u2019t quote me out of context.)\n\nThe seeds are fixed to clear, sticky discs that require a frustrating amount of care to remove from the packaging. Six seeds disappear in quick succession, lost to the carpet or the furthest reaches of my ear canal. That\u2019s \u00a38.60 down the old ear toilet. Unthinkably, the seeds are meant to be changed \u201cevery two to three days, but can be kept on for a week\u201d. I\u2019m not convinced these seeds would stay in place for three minutes if I was dead.\n\nThe instructions recommend cleaning one\u2019s ear with alcohol before application: a faff, as I\u2019m guessing they don\u2019t mean a rum and coke. Eventually I find a suitable alcohol cleaner, which dries my skin of oils and means the discs stay put. Unfortunately, my head now smells of a KFC wipe.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest What is the point of these gaudy little pips, these golden nuggets of futility? Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nShould anyone interested in golden ear seeds manage to couple up \u2013 one would assume it was with an equal idiot, but let\u2019s pretend not \u2013 how would they explain the purchase? \u201cI\u2019ve bought a handful of expensive, microscopic marbles\u201d? At least when Jack traded the family cow for magic beans, he had a beanstalk the next day. There was actual produce involved. These aren\u2019t even real seeds. So what is the point of these gaudy little pips, these golden nuggets of futility?\n\nEar seeds are an ancient element of Chinese medicine, sourced from an actual plant, the vaccaria herb. Yet there is nothing bling about medicine made from the seeds of a weed. Vie Healing are based in West Hollywood, a clue as to the real aim here. (Ironically, weed is popular there, too.) \u201cEnjoy the golden look, the nourishing feeling and this unique approach to easing your symptoms,\u201d the box reads. Vanity, novelty and nonsense, together at last. I get the feeling this is mostly about looking special.\n\nMy worry, though, is that I look too special. The seeds are nestled in a part of my body I can\u2019t see, so enjoying \u201cthe golden look\u201d is frankly a bust. A nourishing feeling? I am mostly experiencing profound anxiety that the missing seeds might find their way into my brain and tunnel through it. As for the unique approach to easing my symptoms, I could train a pigeon to answer my emails but nothing would get done.\n\nPress or stimulate the pellets throughout the day, the box says. I walk around, stimulating my pellet and feeling \u2013 this may shock you \u2013 nothing. Well, that\u2019s not strictly true: it turns out it\u2019s quite painful to push tiny ballbearings into one\u2019s sensitive bits. The 24-carat-plated \u201cion seeds\u201d apparently stimulate reflex centres of the brain \u201cto help you achieve your Calm\u201d, a claim so foggy I can see mist coming off it.\n\nOf course, many believe ear seeds placed on meridian lines clear up qi blockages, which may be true. Even if not, the placebo effect is powerful. But I would rather have a trained practitioner apply them, rather than this keyhole surgery with oven mitts.\n\nIn fairness, the seeds remain in place for days, even after sleep and showers. They are non-invasive and harmless but also ineffective. I resemble a poundshop Lady Gaga who has lost his tiny marbles. You would be better off sticking 24 golden carrots up your arse.\n\nThe seeds may be gold, but the name is pure irony\n\nVie Healing? Not v healing at all.\n\nWellness or hellness?\n\nEarful. I mean awful. 1/5\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
