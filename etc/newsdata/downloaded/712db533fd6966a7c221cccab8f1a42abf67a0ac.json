In part, the pile-on reflected the execution of traditional debate stagecraft: conflict generates coverage, and a candidate who isn\u2019t involved gets forgotten.\n\nBut for moderate Democrats, a more revealing calculation was also at play \u2014 that if Biden implodes, the candidate who most sharply contrasts with Warren will be best positioned to pick up the pieces and take Biden\u2019s place in the race.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/1a/24/c2759c964961ba638ee9d87ffee6/elizabethwarren.png\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it,\u201d said an adviser to one candidate, suggesting an offensive that is likely to animate the next month of the campaign.\n\nThe assault against the progressive twin towers began almost as soon as the debate started and carried over in the next day, as Democrats zeroed in on Warren for ducking a question about whether enacting Medicare for All would require a tax increase on middle-class Americans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still been no explanation for a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan,\u201d Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said on CNN on Wednesday. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Senator Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she\u2019s taken than about how this plan is going to be funded.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, Klobuchar and Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, all but accused Warren of engaging in class warfare, while Klobuchar offered a \u201creality check\u201d on her proposals.\n\n\"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,\u201d Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, said.\n\nPaul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster, said Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u201cfinally got to the place where they can best articulate, \u2018We don\u2019t have to go to the extreme.\u2019 \u2026 Having said that, I think Bernie [Sanders] and Warren were both pretty effective in the way they countered it.\u201d\n\nThe result, Maslin said, is that \u201cyou started to see the lines being drawn more clearly\u201d in the campaign, with the electorate witnessing a \u201csubstantive \u2026 fair test\u201d of ideas.\n\nFor Biden\u2019s progressive rivals in the top tier, Sanders and Warren, the former vice president is still ripe for takedowns. Warren snubbed Biden during a conversation about the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, when Biden said he \u201cwent on the floor and got you votes.\u201d\n\nWarren responded, \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\u201d\n\nAnd Sanders responded to Biden\u2019s claim that he was the only candidate who \u201chas gotten anything really big done,\u201d by saying, \"But you know what you also got done \u2014 and I say this as a good friend \u2014 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done.\u201d\n\nYet lower-polling moderates \u2014 the candidates who stand to gain the most from a Biden crash \u2014 largely laid off him. Biden continues to poll well nationally, and direct efforts by his rivals in previous debates to dislodge him fell flat.\n\nIf he is softening, it is because he has fallen behind Warren in some critical early state polls \u2014 and because money is running thin. Biden ended September with about $9 million on hand, far less than Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s collapsing under the weight of his own operation,\u201d said Colin Strother, a veteran Democratic strategist.\n\nBiden\u2019s rivals, he said, are making him \u201cdig his own way out.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden\u2019s opponents did just that. They let him off the hook when he declined to directly answer a question about why it was appropriate for his son to engage in business in Ukraine while Biden was vice president.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting to Trump.\n\nSen. Cory Booker \u2014 who directly attacked Biden in earlier debates \u2014 even took pains to defend the former vice president, scolding the debate moderators for even bringing Biden\u2019s son up.\n\n\u201cWe are literally using Donald Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Booker said. \u201cAnd the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive.\u201d\n\nMichael Ceraso, a former New Hampshire director for Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign, said that before Tuesday, the narrative surrounding the primary consisted almost exclusively of Biden and Warren.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

And in a contest in which many Democrats remain undecided \u2014 and not motivated principally by ideology \u2014 any number of lower-tier contenders believe they can make late-2019 gains.\n\nBut there is risk in pushing hard from the center. Together, Warren and Sanders account for about 40 percent of Democrats\u2019 national primary support, according to the latest Morning Consult survey. And it wasn\u2019t only moderate Democrats who appeared likely to help their cause this week. In his first debate following his heart attack, Sanders did, too.\n\nHe gently challenged Warren on taxes, prompting Klobuchar to say that \u201cat least Bernie\u2019s being honest here.\u201d In addition to his $33.7 million cash on hand, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans to endorse him on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge for the lower-polling moderates is that they\u2019re misjudging where the Democratic electorate is,\u201d said Andrew Feldman, a Democratic strategist. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like the Democratic electorate at this point wants a run-of-the-mill moderate. Joe Biden is not a run-of-the-mill moderate because of his personal connection to voters through his Obama legacy. And Mayor Pete is a moderate, but he is a generational alternative to Biden.\u201d\n\nFeldman added, \u201cEveryone else essentially is just trying to break through.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/97/5a/56c741184dd48e888cb24baea569/191016-biden-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
