It has spoken to \"dozens of financial firms and online merchants\" as it seeks to raise about $1 billion (R14.4 billion) in investment and enlist partners to help launch the system, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.\n\nFacebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social network has courted Visa, MasterCard, and payment-processor First Data, according to the Journal. It has also approached e-commerce companies and apps about accepting its coin and investing in the project, luring them with the prospect of zero card-processing fees.\n\nFacebook plans to back its coin with dollar reserves to stabilize its value and make it less volatile than bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, according to the report. Introducing a \"stablecoin\" may also be a response to mounting concerns about the privacy and safety of its users, as cryptocurrencies claim to offer anonymity and security.\n\nHowever, there are risks as cryptocurrency deposits have been misused, misplaced, or stolen on several occasions.\n\nThe company is also working on a virtual checkout that consumers could use to make purchases on other websites, similarly to how people can use their Facebook credentials to log in to other sites, according to the Journal. It's also considering paying users fractions of a coin to watch adverts, engage with other content, or shop on its platform, the report adds.\n\nBloomberg and the New York Times previously reported that Facebook was developing a digital coin to allow WhatsApp users to transfer money.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The social network reportedly plans to launch a digital coin that users can spend on and off its platform.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8794/4e4a276ea7ca433c970550cdc7e8140a.png", "published_at": "2019-05-04"}
