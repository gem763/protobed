Researchers at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP 14) have now said that three majestic animal species can no longer be found in India and it\u2019s all due to desertification, where fertile land degrades significantly as a result of deforestation and improper agricultural practices.\n\nThe Indian Cheetah, pink-headed duck, and Great Indian Bustard, all of which could mainly be found in parts of India, have now been officially declared as extinct in the country, while more than 150 other species are quickly approaching the point of extinction and been categorised as critically endangered.\n\n\"We have a database of more than 5.6 million specimens, collected from all over India and also from the neighbouring countries before independence,\u201d Kailash Chandra, Director of the Zoological Survey of India, told ANI. \u201cThey give a lot of information about how things have changed in more than 100 years. If you see their distribution in geo-special platforms, you'll realise how much changes have occurred because of the impact of deforestation and desertification.\u201d\n\nChandra pointed out that even the use of insecticides pesticides, conversion of forest to agricultural land, industries and chemicals, and indiscriminate chopping of nature in the name of development (we\u2019re looking at you, Aarey authorities), are responsible for triggering this deadly desertification. This doesn\u2019t mean development must come to a screeching halt, but rather stresses the need to regulate such practices and minimise the damage done to the environment. He also said that such degradation doesn\u2019t just threaten the survival of animals, but also that of humans and other microscopic beings.\n\n\"The entire food chain is affected due to this,\" says Chandra, stressing that a lot of land in India continues to degrade, with more than 30 percent of its land resources being affected by over-cultivation, soil erosion and depletion of wetlands.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more worrying is that India isn\u2019t the only one having aridity issues. At the conference held in Greater Noida from September 2 to September 13, more than 196 countries and 94 environment ministers got together to acknowledge this crucial issue and work towards conserving the environment, especially in terms land management.\n\nIn fact, a recent UN report estimates that over a million plant and animal species are at risk, especially iconic endangered ones because of reasons ranging from pollution to overfishing, meaning that it\u2019s all happening as a result of human activities. It also pointed out that ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves that protect the surrounding area from hurricanes, and wetlands that absorb water to reduce flooding, have declined dramatically, which is why natural disasters are now being increasingly reported. Apparently it\u2019s not too late to unfuck the planet but we have to act now by incentivising the protection of natural resources and shift our development focus to nature-based planning.\n\nAt the conference last weekend, India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a speech promising cooperation in addressing climate change and land degradation, while the other ministers present are expected to announce their targets for land restoration soon and unilaterally agree on ways to deal with threats like forced migration, sand and dust storms, droughts and water crises.\n\nFollow Shamani Joshi on Instagram.", "description": "The Indian Cheetah, pink-headed duck, and Great Indian Bustard are all casualties of climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d76395f666dcf000ea3f0f6/lede/1568030518558-three-animal-species-declared-extinct-in-India.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
