Many members have already voiced skepticism about the need for a second cut.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a big inter-meeting move in bonds. Markets are expecting a lot less inflation and a lot less growth than the Fed is,\u201d Bullard told the Journal in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell may also shed light on the monetary body\u2019s plans during a discussion on Friday with the head of the Swiss National Bank in Zurich.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly called on the central bank to lower rates by at least 1 percent, while blaming officials for hurting the economy.\n\n\"The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed,\" Trump tweeted recently. \"He\u2019s like a golfer who can\u2019t putt, has no touch.
