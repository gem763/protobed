The singer and world\u2019s worst monkey owner returned to LA after celebrating his second wedding to Hailey Baldwin at a North Carolina resort/former plantation, and\u2014get this\u2014the dude had enough audacity to re-wear a T-shirt he first put on last month.\n\nOh, and Bieber paired the Lichtenstein-printed purple top from his Drew clothing line with Crocs. That\u2019s a visual assault on its own, but the offense becomes downright disgusting considering Biebs previously slipped the foam clogs \u201conly a week ago,\u201d as Vogue documented.\n\nThe venerable glossy took an optimistic approach to reporting on the fashion atrocity, titling its post, \u201cWhat We Can All Learn About Justin Bieber\u2019s Outfit Repeating.\u201d\n\n\u201cBieber\u2019s outfit repeat should be applauded,\u201d Vogue decreed. \u201cA standing ovation, even!\u201d\n\nAfter detailing other very rich people who have deigned to put on the same swaths of fabric more than once, like Kristen Stewart and Tiffany Haddish, the piece ended with, \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite a chic concept: Outfit repeating is simply a person showing some genuine love for a piece of clothing. And what\u2019s more stylish than that?\u201d\n\nI\u2019d counter: a closet full of expensive shit you wore for two hours once five years ago and are far too important to ever even touch again.\n\nJust kidding, I am a non-famous plebe, typing this with hands covered in a brown sweater that I napped in last weekend. Perhaps surprisingly to Vogue, which had to pull a feel-good moral out of the sight of a man in an old T-shirt to understand the phenomenon of \u201coutfit repeating,\u201d I often do the same.\n\n\u201cBut should celebrities?\u201d our tabloids bravely wonder. Late last month, readers gleefully dragged Page Six after the gossip site published an urgent, breaking story: \u201cKate Middleton re-wears her blue Alexander McQueen coat for a fourth time.\u201d\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge purchased the piece in question five years ago; the coat I use every winter is older than her first-born son. I don\u2019t blame Kate for re-wearing something that makes her look like a tall glass of Perrier (not complimentary tap) water. If it isn\u2019t broke and doesn\u2019t come from a fashion house that has recently done something culturally insensitive, don\u2019t fix it.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s a $3,000 coat, I would wear that shit every single day \u201d\n\nBut Page Six framed the royal\u2019s decision to not throw it away as brave. \u201cKate Middleton isn\u2019t afraid to re-wear one of her most-loved articles of clothing,\u201d the story opened. CNN journalist Andrea Diaz tweeted what most were probably thinking: \u201cIt\u2019s a $3,000 coat, I would wear that shit every single day.\u201d\n\nMeghan Markle, too, recycled many clothes on her recent 10-day tour of Africa. It\u2019s hard not to draw conclusions the Duchess of Sussex did this to remind fans she\u2019s the relatable, normal \u201cluckiest girl in the world\u201d they first fell in love with. (Easy to believe if you ignore the fact that her wardrobe for the visit reportedly cost nearly $5,000.)\n\nPeople dubbed Meghan\u2019s $824 Noni trench dress a \u201cmeaningful\u201d choice to wear when meeting with Grac\u0327a Machel, an advocate for women\u2019s rights and Nelson Mandela\u2019s widow. This is because a year ago, Meghan put it on for an event celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the anti-apartheid activist\u2019s birth. So: outfit repeating is fine, as long as everything you wear has its own humanitarian theme.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, the fashion industry is public enemy No. 1, a Big Bad Polluter and case study in Americans\u2019 love of all things disposable. Surely then, a magazine applauding a person for wearing something more than once comes off as quite tone-deaf.\n\n\u201c In the sense of wearing what is familiar, mood-enhancing, comfortable, and cherished, these celebrities really are just like us \u201d\n\nThere is more to being an eco-conscious human than wearing a coat that costs as much as some cars do four times in five years. The only thing we can \u201clearn\u201d from Justin Bieber \u201crecycling\u201d a T-shirt is that he knows how to do laundry.\n\nOr\u2014rather like Kate, Meghan and everyone else who wears things more than once\u2014maybe he just likes the T-shirt. In the sense of wearing what is familiar, mood-enhancing, comfortable, and cherished, these celebrities really are just like us.\n\nSo please, let the man re-wear his Crocs in peace.", "description": "Justin Bieber, Kate Middleton, and Meghan Markle all recycle outfits, wearing expensive clothing more than once.
