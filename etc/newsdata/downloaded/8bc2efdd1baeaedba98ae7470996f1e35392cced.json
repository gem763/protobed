CHINA OUT.\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - A Chinese rival offers WeWork a turnaround blueprint. Like Adam Neumann\u2019s office-sharing outfit, over-expansion at the smaller Beijing-based Kr Space led to a cash crunch. The company has started selling office services to corporate clients across the People\u2019s Republic. A similar pivot will not salvage WeWork\u2019s plunging valuation, but it could stem losses.\n\nThe We Company, which may run out of cash as early as next month, is in talks with backer SoftBank for a rescue package that could value the business at just $8 billion, according to Reuters. But well before its initial public offering failed last month, Chinese peers were already grappling with similar funding woes. Slowing economic growth and weak demand in the People\u2019s Republic pushed up office vacancy rates across 17 major cities to a decade-high of 21.5%, according to third quarter figures from commercial property group CBRE.\n\nThat has squeezed the likes of Kr Space, which operated a WeWork-style model of signing long-term leases - often in pricey commercial districts - and renting out trendy shared spaces for short term usage. But bruising price wars and a venture capital funding slowdown primed the sector for a downturn. In the first ten months of 2018, 40 office-sharing brands closed down in the country, according to one estimate from a Chinese industry association. Kr Space slashed jobs, closed locations, and halted expansion.\n\nYet founder Liu Chengcheng is proving nimble. In May the entrepreneur secured a 1 billion yuan ($141 million) financial lifeline from backers including IDG Capital at an undisclosed valuation. The company refocused on catering to larger corporate customers, such as $12 billion local advertising giant Focus Media, and offers services like opening, designing and managing offices. Since Kr Space partners with landlords, it can keep new lease obligations to a minimum. It\u2019s early days, but the new strategy could show results quickly: the upstart is on track to turn cash-flow positive by end of the year, according to someone familiar with the company. Local rivals are adopting Liu\u2019s strategy too.\n\nWeWork\u2019s new bosses might consider following them. Corporate customers currently make up less than half of total memberships; that\u2019s an opportunity to address. The company has put mainland expansion plans on hold, according to media reports, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t learn from China.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - A Chinese rival offers WeWork a turnaround blueprint.
