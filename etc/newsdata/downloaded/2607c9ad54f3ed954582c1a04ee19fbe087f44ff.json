Perhaps his family does at times, one is not sure. He\u2019s not a likeable type. He has no time for pleasantries and he\u2019s cold and reserved. Being obviously unpleasant is not uncommon to politicians. Amit Shah can be uncivil and brusque, even on the first encounter as he was with me many years ago. Chidambaram is usually grouchy and sullen, possibly irritated by the world\u2019s stupidity.\n\nHe called me some years ago for advice on how he could write a syndicated column (me being the leading expert). I spent half an hour of my weekend patiently walking him through his options, answering his many questions and offering to connect him. The next day he sent me a rude mail about a piece I had written on the Congress failings regarding laws like AFSPA in which I had named him. He advised me to spend more time doing research and master the details before I wrote or some such thing, if I have it right (I cannot remember the details unfortunately).\n\nAnyway, so having established that he\u2019s not the sort one enthusiastically jumps to the defence of, I must do precisely that because it is the right thing to do. I can say without compunction or reservation that he is being stitched up and the case against him is absurd. I am not speaking to his morality or ethics. I am referring to his precision and his discipline. This government\u2019s wild accusations against him do not in a single way reflect the actions of the only man to have competently run both India\u2019s home and finance ministries.\n\nThe manner in which he has been gone after, including the comical scenes from outside his house enacted by the clowns of the CBI, a thoroughly compromised body, goes to prove this. It is the media circus that interests those persecuting him and Shashi Tharoor. It is not the principles of justice. Chidambaram, because of his sobriety, restraint and his exactitude, is the most credible and therefore the most effective of this government\u2019s critics. What is sought to be damaged and maligned in his brutalisation is this effectiveness.\n\nThe question we should ask ourselves as citizens is: why is this allowed to happen in our democracy? The answer is that our polity has no defence against strong leaders who want to impose their will. Two reasons for this: one, there is no real rule of law in India; two, the judiciary does not do its job.\n\nLet us take the first one first. A case of sedition was filed this week against dozens of people including Ramachandra Guha, Mani Ratnam, Soumitra Chatterjee and Aparna Sen for writing a letter to the Prime Minister. There are quite precise guidelines on what constitutes sedition and what does not. This letter, needless to say, does not. The case should not have been registered. But it was and neither the police nor the magistrate showed any understanding of the law. I should add here that I have personal, unpleasant experience of the recklessness with which sedition has been used in our times.\n\nThere will be no punishment or admonition handed out to either police or magistrate when this action is reversed or, as usually happens in lawless India, frozen. That is why it will happen again and that is what is meant by an absence of rule of law.\n\nThe second point is obvious but must be referred to because it is important. The Supreme Court is neither infallible nor independent. I am not revealing a state secret. It was the Supreme Court that supported the Emergency, expressing a \u201cdiamond hard, diamond bright\u201d faith that the individual, Indira Gandhi, who imposed it could never do wrong. Our chief justices are prone to setting off on Quixotic missions like making people stand for the national anthem in movie theatres. Our rights and liberties are not as interesting.\n\nBy this government\u2019s admission in Parliament, not a single case Kashmir\u2019s police has filed against India\u2019s armed forces through the decades has been proceeded with in court. Justice for rape, murder and torture has been denied, by admission. Indian courts show enthusiasm for upholding their own dignity through the contempt law, the rest of us can be manhandled in the way Chidambaram currently is and that is fine with them. When he is out and the charges collapse, as they will, there will be no accountability for those who put him through this. We will all, media, judges and the public, move on. Another circus will be showing.\n\nThose accused of criminality in India mumble the mantra: \u2018I have full faith in the judiciary\u2019. The formulation is regurgitated out of fear and not respect. It is the responsibility and the duty of the courts to change that.", "description": "I don\u2019t know anyone who likes P Chidambaram.
