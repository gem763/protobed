Later that night, \u00adauthorities said two people, \u00addescribed by neighbors and police as a man with special needs and his home health aide, were shot during what officials said is being investigated as a robbery at a Northeast Washington rowhouse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe District\u2019s homicide count stands at 133, about 6 percent above last year\u2019s pace, which jumped nearly 40 percent from the previous year.\n\n\u201cTo be quite honest, I\u2019m sick and tired of the shootings that are happening in our city, and I think collectively we have to do something about it,\u201d D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters after the teenager was killed.\n\nNo quadrant of the District has been spared from violence in recent weeks, causing concern in neighborhoods from Columbia Heights to Shaw to Kingman Park to Deanwood. Gunmen have shot from speeding cars and using high-powered rifles.\n\nThe latest fatal shooting came shortly before 1 p.m. Thursday, when police said the housing employee was parked on a street at the entrance to Potomac Gardens, a public housing complex south of Pennsylvania Avenue and east of the Marine Barracks at 8th and I streets SE.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice Cmdr. Morgan Kane, who heads the 1st District station, said patrol officers responded to calls for shots fired and found the victim inside the complex. She said that \u201cthe individual was here on his lunch break\u201d and that detectives are investigating the case as an attempted robbery. Police said they would be reviewing surveillance cameras to see whether the incident was captured.\n\nJose C. Sousa, a D.C. Housing Authority spokesman, would not provide details of the worker or describe his job until police identify him publicly. \u201cWe at the District of Columbia Housing Authority are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our employees,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, police identified a suspect sought in the fatal shootings inside a rowhouse in the 1600 block of Rosedale Street NE in Kingman Park. Davon Peyton, 27, of Alexandria, Va., was charged in a warrant with first-degree murder while armed, police said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe victims were identified as Devon Miller, 24, who lived in the two-story home with his grandmother, and Lekelefac Fonge, 27, of Lanham, Md. Relatives for Fonge could not be reached.\n\nA woman who said she was related to Miller and two neighbors who recalled him growing up described a young man full of smiles who loved to dance but was largely nonverbal. The neighbors and relative declined to provide their names, citing safety fears and to protect the victims\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cThis is a community that is broken,\u201d one woman said. \u201cEveryone here knew Devon as he grew up.\u201d\n\nPolice identified the 15-year-old who was killed Wednesday afternoon in the 1300 block of Half Street SW, in the James Creek public housing complex near the waterfront and Nationals Park, as Thomas Johnson of Southeast Washington.\n\nAD\n\nPolice did not cite a specific motive but said the shooting appeared to be targeted. \u201cIt looks like they were looking for this young man for some reason, and they took his life,\u201d Newsham said.\n\nAD\n\nAuthorities made public a surveillance picture of what appeared to be a young man sprinting from the shooting, which occurred about 1:20 p.m. The FBI doubled a $25,000 reward offered by D.C. police for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case.\n\nPolice said the youth did not live in the neighborhood in which he was shot. His relatives could not be reached. In a letter to the school community, Anacostia High School Principal William Haith said Thomas\u2019s death is a \u201cdevastating loss.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThomas was the ninth juvenile between 11 and 17 killed in the District this year. Nine juveniles between 10 and 17 were slain in the city in 2018.\n\nSeveral times in recent days, Newsham continued his long-standing argument blaming violence on the proliferation of illegal firearms and a criminal justice system he says fails to adequately punish offenders his officers arrest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe also need to start looking at policies and how we\u2019re going to hold people accountable,\u201d the chief said. \u201cWe have to take a close look to see if the penalties that are being handed out for carrying illegal firearms in our community are changing behavior. It is my opinion that they are not.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Authorities in Washington are investigating four homicides in 24 hours.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
