Great picture, color, and sharpness. It was really easy to setup with streaming apps. It automatically knows when I put in a DVD and goes to the right input. Remote has buttons to go directly to Netflix, Amazon prime, and other apps. It also costs half the price of any other 70-inch TV. No repair issues, thankfully. We have had no problems and recommend to all looking for a 70-inch TV.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe bought this TV to downsize to match our new living room, and we were worried that the 70-inch would not be as vivid and impressive like the VIZIO 75-inch,\u201d a Walmart reviewer wrote. \u201cThe worry was for nothing. This TV is just as great as the 75-inch, and a perfect fit, using the articulating mount we purchased at the same time. The TV looks like it's floating on the wall. We also purchased the VIZIO bluetooth sound bar and sub woofer, which is also mounted on the wall. It looks GREAT!\u201d\n\nLooking for more deals on VIZIO 4K and HD TVs?
