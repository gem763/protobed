Photo: Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\nIf all you know about Unbelievable is that it follows a pair of maverick cops as they try to catch a serial rapist, you might assume it\u2019s just another true-crime story depicting violence against women. You\u2019d be mistaken. The Netflix drama is less interested in the rapist and his horrific crimes than in another, more insidious villain: the criminal-justice system.\n\nOver eight tightly constructed episodes, Unbelievable illuminates how police and prosecutors, who tend to be men, routinely disregard and disbelieve the accounts of women who\u2019ve been raped. Based on the story of an actual investigation in Colorado and Washington that was first chronicled in a Pulitzer-winning ProPublica article, it tells the tale of a male cop who botched a rape investigation, and a tenacious pair of female cops (played by Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) who, bucking the system, seek justice for a series of victims. (Kaitlyn Dever is particularly affecting as a teenager who is charged with false reporting after telling the cops about her attack.) This may sound like difficult viewing, but the show is every bit as as riveting as the most gripping thrillers \u2014 a testament to the skill of the writers, who include Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, and the showrunner, Susannah Grant, who wrote the screenplay for Erin Brockovich. Recently, Vulture caught up with Grant to talk about how she turned this heavy material into such propulsive and essential TV.\n\nI was struck by the way you shot the rape scenes. They seemed very different from most depictions of rape I\u2019ve seen in TV or film, in part because they\u2019re never remotely titillating. You\u2019re always shooting from the victim\u2019s perspective. How did you approach these scenes?\n\nI had never a written a scene of sexual violence before. When I sat down to write it, I wanted to make sure that we weren\u2019t doing anything that could, in any way, evoke rape porn, of which there is already way too much in our culture. It was clear I needed to write it from a subjective viewpoint, with very selective images, and that the images should be the memories that Marie [played by Dever] herself is carrying and wrestling with.\n\nYou also dedicate little time to showing the perpetrator onscreen or delving into his psyche. Was there much discussion about how much space he should take up?\n\nReally early on, we said, This isn\u2019t a story about him. I didn\u2019t want viewers to meet him until the detectives met him.\n\nWhy was that?\n\nBecause we wanted to tell the story of these three women. We were telling two stories: the story of one woman who has experienced the worst possible kind of repercussions after reporting a rape, feeling like she was completely alone in the world, and these two other women, hundreds of miles away, who, without knowing it, are busting their asses to save her.\n\nDid you think of it as a consciously feminist project?\n\nUm, no. [Laughs.] I mean, I didn\u2019t not think of it as a feminist project. It wasn\u2019t something I thought about. I didn\u2019t sit down to write a feminist piece. I sat down to write something good and make something good. But maybe, just as a feminist, anything I write is a feminist project.\n\nThe way you talk about shooting the rape scenes, that seems like a very specific choice that\u2019s in contrast to the ways that rape scenes have often been shot in the history of TV and cinema.\n\nI had this really vivid reaction when I watched The Jagged Edge in 1985. I hope I\u2019m remembering this right, but my memory is that the rapist cuts off the nipple of his victim. I remember sitting there going, You disgusting fucker. It was so disgustingly, weirdly, horribly titillating, and I was just like, I\u2019m never doing that shit. I don\u2019t really want to slam [Jagged Edge director] Joe Eszterhas, because it\u2019s hard to make a good thing and I thought he made good movies. But that one scene, I said, The world has enough rape in movies. But it turns out it doesn\u2019t.\n\nWhy do you think you changed your mind on that?\n\nI was just starting my journey as a writer. It shows you that the bold declarative statements you make when you\u2019re starting out in your career \u2026 [trails off and pauses] obviously, there\u2019s always a new way of doing something. If you\u2019re doing it with integrity, it\u2019s worth doing.\n\nWhat was the most important thing you learned about how rape is investigated, and how that process should be changed?\n\nExperience matters and training matters. The experience and training that those detectives had in Colorado was so different from the experience and training of the detectives in Washington. The guy who investigated Marie\u2019s case had just transferred over from narcotics. It was either his second or third sexual assault he\u2019d investigated. He didn\u2019t have a career of interviewing women who had been through this experience. He didn\u2019t have the understanding that those cops in Colorado had.\n\nIt was interesting how the viewer doesn\u2019t necessarily realize how bad the first cop is at his job until we meet the cop who will eventually go on to solve it. We get to see how differently she approaches her own investigation.\n\nI thought about this a lot. A simple villain who is motivated by nothing other than malice is not nearly as interesting as someone who thinks he\u2019s doing all the right things and makes absolutely cataclysmic mistakes in what he thinks is in the name of justice.\n\nBut I was also thinking broadly about the issue of our cultural collective mistrust of rape victims. It\u2019s a crime in which the victims are routinely disbelieved, you know? Nobody says to a carjacking victim, \u201cI don\u2019t think it really happened.\u201d When something is that widespread, it can\u2019t just be because of a few bad actors. We, as a culture, have absorbed some essentially bad information in a way that we\u2019re not aware of. I wanted the audience to be able to understand how this cop would make these bad decisions, because I liked the idea of making the audience complicit in those bad decisions.\n\nAs disturbing as the show is, it\u2019s so entertaining too. How did you balance those forces?\n\nA really propulsive storytelling engine \u2014 these two detectives actively investigating someone that we, as viewers, really want caught \u2014 buys you room to introduce character, to introduce relationships, to introduce the fact that investigating a horrible crime doesn\u2019t mean that every minute is horror. There are moments of levity. That\u2019s just my storytelling instinct. I don\u2019t live in a world of bleakness, myself. I hope I\u2019m willing to look unflinchingly at really bleak things, but I also really hold to the belief that the depths to which you\u2019re able to experience stress and pain are equal to the heights to which you\u2019re able to experience joy.\n\nThe cops played by Wever and Collette are so funny and entertaining and warm. Those characteristics are maybe alluded to in ProPublica\u2019s article, but we don\u2019t really see them in action. How did you develop their storylines?\n\nI took a lot of creative license. We changed all the names of all the characters in the show, primarily out of respect for the privacy of the people involved. For those two characters, I use some of the facts of their lives as inspiration \u2014 and the qualities that their work suggests \u2014 but I don\u2019t know anything about their personal lives or their marriages, nor did the women want that to inform our telling of it. At the same time, you\u2019re not gonna tell a story and not know the fullness of the two main characters\u2019 lives. So I took a lot of creative license there, and then we hired Toni and Merritt, who add so much texture to any character on the page. They\u2019re both so full of surprises.\n\nDid you worry about how difficult Marie\u2019s story would be to watch? How opening with her, as opposed to opening with the cops and the suspense of their unfolding investigation, might lose viewers?\n\nI didn\u2019t worry about it, because I knew this was a real person\u2019s experience. It felt like we would\u2019ve been misrepresenting something that was essential to not misrepresent, you know? I didn\u2019t want to try to soft-pedal it.\n\nPeople often will say, and it\u2019s true, that the rape investigation feels like a second assault. And there are a lot of difficult images in that first episode. But we had a screening for a small group in New York, and the thing that had the audience gasping audibly was when Marie was asked to tell her story again, for the fifth time that day, only write it down this time. I wasn\u2019t worried because I think you\u2019re drawn towards this young woman. I think audiences can handle that. It also helps knowing that all eight episodes are going to drop at once, and that people can roll right into the next episode.\n\nDo you watch any other true-crime shows? Were there any you drew inspiration from?\n\nI didn\u2019t look to other shows for inspiration. You do have to keep in mind, these are real people and you have to treat their stories with respect, which doesn\u2019t mean you have to be just flatly flattering to everyone. You don\u2019t, but you do have to respect the truth of what they went through.\n\nThere\u2019s so much texture and detail about life inside the force and how investigations actually function. Did you have a cop consultants?\n\nWe had a great cop consultant named Liz Devine who worked with CSI for a long time. She had worked in the sheriff\u2019s department in L.A. She had a lot of hands-on experience, but also theatrical experience, so she was there any day that law enforcement stuff was in play. We really gave her authority to tell us when we were doing something that wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\nThere was one line in the ProPublica article that I was struck by, where Stacy Galbrith, the detective who inspired Merritt Weaver\u2019s character, says, \u201cA lot of times people say, Believe your victim. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. I think it\u2019s, Listen to your victim.\u201d It made me curious to hear how you thought about this story in light of #MeToo.\n\nWe sold it right before the revelations about Harvey Weinstein kicked off a massive movement. We had a meeting with our host at Netflix, and they wanted to talk about whether or not the movement affects this storytelling at all. Were there any adjustments we wanted to make, given what the world has become and what our culture has become? We all decided, No, let\u2019s just tell the story we\u2019re going to tell and see where it lands.", "description": "Susannah Grant, the showrunner of Netflix\u2019s new drama \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d turned a Pulitzer-winning investigation into propulsive and essential TV. \u201cI wanted to make sure that we weren\u2019t doing anything that could, in any way, evoke rape porn,\u201d she says.", "authors": ["Lila Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-unbelievable.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
