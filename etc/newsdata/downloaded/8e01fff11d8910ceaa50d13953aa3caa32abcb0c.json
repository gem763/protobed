The protesters, who said they were from Freedom House, held up signs that read: \u201cShame the NBA,\u201d '\u201dSouth Park was right\u201d and \u201cMemo to the NBA: Principles over profit! No censorship! USA loves Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nPRO-HONG KONG NBA FAN BOOTED FROM PHILADELPHIA 76ERS PRESEASON GAME AGAINST CHINESE TEAM\n\nAfter the Chinese national anthem was played, one person shouted: \u201cFreedom of expression! Freedom of speech! Free Hong Kong!\u201d A second person also shouted for a free Hong Kong from the second level during the second quarter of the contest.\n\nSecurity guards at the Capital One Arena then confronted a fan holding up a \u201cFree Tibet\u201d sign and another holding up the Tibet flag. Security tried to take the sign, but the fan resisted and they walked away from their seats and were followed by security.\n\nA sign stating \u201cGoogle Uyghurs\u201d was also held up and then confiscated during the game. Jon Schweppe, who held the \"Google Uyghurs\" sign, tweeted a video showing it being taken away by a security guard. The Uyghurs are a Muslim ethnic group originating from Central and East Asia, with the largest population residing in China\u2019s autonomous Xinjiang region. China has called the group a terrorist collective, which has given the government cause to treat the region like a surveillance state. Scores of Uyghurs have been placed in detention centers across the region.\n\n\u201cThe building security staff removed signs tonight in accordance with Capital One Arena's long-standing signs, banners, posters and flag policy. No fans were asked to leave the game,\u201d A Wizards spokesman said in a statement.\n\nNBA IN CHINA: LAKERS, NETS SHANGHAI PRESEASON GAME TO HAVE NO MEDIA AVAILABILITY\n\nMore than a half-dozen protesters demonstrated inside the arena. They handed out \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts before the game. A Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation spokeswoman said the group was planning to hand out shirts inside the arena as well.\n\nA similar scene unfolded during a Philadelphia 76ers game against Guangzhou on Tuesday night.\n\nThe NBA only prohibits \u201cobscene or indecent messages on signs or clothing.\u201d There are no hard and fast rules on political messages.\n\nThe protests come in the middle of a firestorm between the NBA and China over a tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey that read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThough the tweet had been deleted, the NBA and the Rockets immediately began getting backlash. Several Chinese sportswear brands suspended ties with the Rockets.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said he wasn\u2019t going to prohibit anyone\u2019s free speech but regretted the outcome of Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "While the Chinese government continues its strict censorship of\u00a0media interactions surrounding NBA\u00a0exhibition games in the Communist country, league-linked entities have also taken steps to crack down on potential protests\u00a0in the U.S.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
