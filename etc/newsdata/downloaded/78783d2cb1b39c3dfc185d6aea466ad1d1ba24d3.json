Their average attendance this season was 14,734 as they drew 1,178,735 overall. The only team worse in attendance was their Florida counterparts, the Miami Marlins, who drew well under a million people as they won just 57 games.\n\nCastor is hoping the city sees the value of the team despite the paltry attendance figures, and will be attempting to revive talks of a new stadium in Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cI really feel like we should probably maybe just start over again,\u201d Castor said as she settled in behind home plate on Tuesday night. \u201cEverybody just come back to the table and start over again. Finding out what the Rays want and need, and then which community can best fulfill those needs.\u201d\n\nCastor was referring to the 2018 discussions between the Rays and Hillsborough County. Enough progress was made building a new ballpark in Ybor City that renderings of the park with a translucent roof were revealed, and that it would come with a price tag of $892 million. Talks on the Ybor project fell apart in December 2018 as there was a lack of details on the project, and as a result, progress stalled. This also marked the end of St. Petersburg\u2019s lease exemption allowing the Rays to talk to Hillsborough, and Rays owners did not ask Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred to step in and ask for an extension.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very important to keep the Rays in Tampa Bay. We\u2019ve shown that we can support all of our sports teams, and we just need to work with the Rays to decide what the best location is for the stadium.\" - Tampa Bay Mayor Jane Castor\n\nAt the time, Rays principal owner Stu Sternberg said a future home in Ybor represented the \"best opportunity\" for the team\u2019s long-term success. At a news conference when the renderings were introduced, the Rays would not say how much the team intends to contribute. A number of elected officials responded that taxpayers won't be footing the bill for the proposed stadium.\n\nThat was a point Tampa Bay\u2019s Mayor reiterated Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf a decision was made to build a stadium in Tampa, I have said from the beginning that taxpayer dollars would not be used to build a new stadium, and I stand by that,\u201d Castor said. \u201cThere are many ways to get a stadium built.\u201d\n\nTropicana Field has been the Rays\u2019 home since the team\u2019s inception in 1998, outdated in today\u2019s baseball environment - the stadium is the only domed facility without a retractable roof.\n\nWhile the capacity of the Trop is 40,000 fans, the team has repeatedly tarped off sections of seats to hide how empty it is. This season\u2019s \u201ccapacity\u201d was a mere 25,025, and they opened up more seats for their two home playoff games against Houston, which both drew north of 32,000.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCastor confirmed that, as of now, there are no active discussions to bring a stadium and the Rays to Tampa or Hillsborough County. She said the Rays\u2019 playoff run reminds the community of the need to work together to keep the team in Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cWe need to support that as a region and show the Rays we want them here,\" Castor said. \"I just want to sit down and have those discussions with the Rays. If it\u2019s in conjunction with St. Pete, with Pinellas, with Hillsborough, with Tampa, just bring everybody together and figure out what\u2019s best for the region.\u201d\n\nCastor\u2019s vow to not use public funds on the stadium will be tested since several of Major League Baseball\u2019s newest stadiums - including Atlanta\u2019s SunTrust Park (2017), Miami\u2019s Marlins Park (2012) and Minneapolis\u2019 Target Field (2010) - have all been supported with local funding.\n\nThis past June, the Rays\u2019 ownership group made the bombshell announcement of a plan to eventually split home games between Tampa Bay and Montreal.\n\nThis plan, which was roundly criticized, would have started in 2024, with the Rays playing in an open-air, 27,000-seat stadium on the St. Petersburg waterfront or amid booming downtown Tampa before then playing the section of their schedule in Montreal.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThat was inspired by the Montreal Expos\u2019 playing half of their schedule in Puerto Rico their final few years in that city before moving to Washington in 2005 and becoming the Nationals.\n\nThe Rays, Tampa Bay and St. Petersburg have plenty of time to come up with a solution. The Rays\u2019 deal with Tropicana Field ends in 2027.", "description": "The Tampa Bay Rays are still battling in the playoffs, while another long-term one continues off the field.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Mayor-Jane-Castor.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
