They only gave her blue paper towels and didn't believe it was burning her.\"\n\nEmelia and Phebe were then led off into a treatment area where other children with similar injuries were being looked after.\n\n(Image: Emelia Southam)\n\nStacey had to find her own way into the emergency room - despite her mobile number being written on her daughter's wristtag.\n\n\"Phebes's mum didn't even know she had a burn and waited over ten minutes before she even got to see her daughter\", Stacey added.\n\nMedics gave Emelia and her friend an antihistamine, but staff admitted to both parents they had no idea why the slime was causing burns.\n\n(Image: Emelia Southam)\n\nStacey says she is yet to hear back from organisers of the event, despite leaving her contact details.\n\nShe said: \"I was told someone would be contacting me but no one has even bothered to see how my daughter was.\"\n\n\"It's just disgusting - you would never imagine that something like this would ever happen at a family friendly event.\n\nKelly Pullinger, Phebe's mum, added: \"I\u2019m in total shock that the event was allowed to go on the following day, it could have been tragic\".\n\n(Image: Emelia Southam)\n\nTickets for adults and three children at the Nickelodeon Slime Fest cost \u00a395.\n\nEvent organisers sold out shows, on Saturday, Sunday and Monday with two shows each day.\n\nDozens of other kids were also apparently affected by the toxic slime during the event.\n\nMum Vivienne Hannah said her two kids and one of their friends are still being treated for the injuries sustained there on Saturday .\n\n(Image: Emelia Southam)\n\nDavid McGavin, 12, and Hannah McGavin, 11, plus David's pal Arron MacKay, 11, needed treatment.\n\nVivienne, 43, had travelled from Dunoon in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, to Blackpool, Lancashire, over the weekend with the three youngsters and Arron's mum Laura MacKay.\n\n\"I am absolutely raging about this. The medical centre at the arena was full of crying children being treated for burns,\" Vivienne said.\n\nA Nickelodeon spokesperson said: \u201cProtecting children\u2019s safety and wellbeing is of paramount importance to us.\n\n\"A small number of children of the thousands who were slimed during Slimefest 2019 experienced a minor skin reaction. As is standard practice with our events, trained medical practitioners were on site. They provided assistance to those affected.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Stacey Southam, from the West Midlands, slammed the reaction of staff at the Nickelodeon Slime Fest and claims they initially ignored her daughter's complaints", "authors": ["Neil Murphy", "Image", "Emelia Southam", "Vivienne Hannah"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20701271.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mums-anger-after-daughter-8-left-with-burns-on-neck-and-face-from-toxic-slime.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
