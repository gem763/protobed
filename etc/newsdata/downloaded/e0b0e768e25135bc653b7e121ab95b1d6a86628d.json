A lot of the language is designed to trigger [emotions] rather than elucidate.\u201d\n\nQ&A What is a customs union? Show Hide A customs union means that countries agree to apply no or very low tariffs to goods sold between them, and to collectively apply the same tariffs to imported goods from the rest of the world. International trade deals are then negotiated by the bloc as a whole. For the EU, this means deals are negotiated by by Brussels, although individual member state governments agree the mandate and approve the final deal. The EU has trade deals covering 69 countries, including Canada and South Korea, which the UK has been struggling to roll over into post-Brexit bilateral agreements. Proponents of an independent UK trade policy outside the EU customs union say Britain must forge its own deals if it is to take advantage of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies. However they have never explained why Germany manages to export more than three times the value in goods to China than Britain does, while also being in the EU customs union. Jennifer Rankin\n\nIn the same way as business language fell in line with increasingly complex corporate practices in the 80s and 90s, and the vocabulary around technology flowered alongside online culture in the 00s, there has been an eruption in English political coinages in the years after the Brexit vote, says Thorne.\n\nThe vocabulary is often \u201cskunked\u201d or twisted, so it becomes hard to pin down, sometimes usefully so for its users. On the left, \u201ccentrist dad\u201d, something many people call themselves, can also be a pejorative term; \u201cmagic grandpa\u201d is used to describe Jeremy Corbyn by both fans and detractors; and a \u201cnormie\u201d is someone who can be found on both the left and the right, who wrongly accepts social standards and mainstream media.\n\nThe right tends to have the wider lexicon, says Thorne. Remain supporters are variously identified by opponents as \u201canywheres\u201d and \u201cremainiacs\u201d engaged in \u201c\u201cremoanathons\u201d. There are dozens of pejorative nouns including \u201csoyboy\u201d, \u201clibtard\u201d, \u201csnowflake\u201d, \u201ccrybaby\u201d, \u201celite\u201d and \u201cestablishment\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson has revelled in using military metaphors such as \u2018surrender\u2019 to deride parliamentary opposition to no deal. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nRarely used terms have gained increasing currency to describe new tactics of argument, Thorne says. There is \u201cwhataboutery\u201d (rebutting an attack only by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy), \u201cbothsidesism\u201d (false balance in political debate) and \u201castroturfing\u201d (pretending a campaign has grassroots support).\n\nBoris Johnson has refused to back down over his use of military metaphors, including \u201csurrender\u201d. He jokingly asked a crowd at the Conservative party conference this week: \u201cAm I fighting a losing battle to use these military metaphors? Or should I stick to my guns?\u201d\n\nLast month Johnson described as \u201chumbug\u201d calls from Labour MPs to moderate his language in the light of the murder of their colleague Jo Cox in 2016, and has been criticised for talking of \u201ca terrible kind of collaboration\u201d between opponents of Brexit and EU states.\n\nQ&A Brexit phrasebook: what are citizens' rights? Show Hide Citizens\u2019 rights are the rights and protections offered to all EU citizens, including free movement and residence, equal treatment and a wide range of other rights under EU law regarding work, education, social security and health. They are held by some 3.5 million citizens from other member states in the UK and about 1.2 million British nationals on the continent, and are a key part of the negotiations that are taking Britain out of Europe. Read more on citizens' rights\n\nMore from the Brexit phrasebook\n\nAll the main UK political parties this week signed a pledge to use moderate language. It urged leaders to \u201cweigh their words carefully, bearing in mind that there are stark divisions across the country on Brexit\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe right in the UK has only recently fired up the war metaphors, ramping up the notion of violent conflict and the associated notion already used against the EU of uniting against an \u2018enemy\u2019,\u201d says Thorne. \u201cNow it\u2019s a little different \u2013 the enemy is here at home and is anyone who disagrees. The left\u2019s vocabulary is more varied mixing jokey derision \u2013 melt [moderates], unicorn [impossible dream] \u2013 with more savage descriptions such as pathocracy [leadership by people with personality disorders].\u201d\n\nThorne has identified confusing \u201csemantic clustering\u201d around contentious words such as \u201ccollusion\u201d, which has been used on both sides of the debate. Downing Street described the drafting of the Benn act opposing a no-deal Brexit as collusion, while the same term was used to allege that Johnson\u2019s backers may profit financially from Britain crashing out of the EU.\n\nGiven it is hard to keep up, some observers have suggested the new semantic flowering suggests politics is becoming untethered from reality.\n\nSteve Buckledee, the author of The Language of Brexit, a book about the language of the referendum campaign, says the elaborate and codified nature of the language being used more than three years on could be evidence that most of the population has tuned out.\n\n\u201cPerhaps Joe Public is fed up with it all,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the people who are still interested are having a private conversation among themselves which only they understand.\u201d\n\nGlossary\n\nAirfix patriotism \u2013 caricatured vision of our heroic past based on war comics and model aeroplanes.\n\nCosmopolitan \u2013 dogwhistle term for internationally influential Jewish person (eg George Soros).\n\nQuitlings \u2013 whining supporters of Brexit.\n\nReplacement theory \u2013 racist idea that a white population is being replaced by people of other ethnic groups.\n\nAttitudinarianism \u2013 assuming a pose or belief for effect.\n\nCancel culture \u2013 mass boycotts of celebrities who voice divergent opinions.\n\nFinger-sniffer \u2013 someone who revels in toxic behaviour.\n\nKing Baby \u2013 an adult who requires the self-centred gratification of an infant.
