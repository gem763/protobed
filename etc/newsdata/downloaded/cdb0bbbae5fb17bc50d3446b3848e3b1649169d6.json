Despite the Lionesses enduring four losses in five matches before they stuttered to an unconvincing 1-0 victory over Portugal on Tuesday night, spectators have at least gained lasting insight into a player that has been long-touted as the future of this team.\n\n\"What you've seen over the last few days is one or two players have come in and cemented their place in the team for the Wembley game,\" manager Phil Neville said on Tuesday night, referencing England's next fixture against Germany where nearly 80,000 are already expected. You can only assume Williamson is one of them.\n\nThe 22-year-old defender, who often doubles up as a holding midfielder for her club Arsenal, started for England against Brazil and Portugal, her first appearances in Neville's XI since the SheBelieves Cup in March. Pairing up with Steph Houghton in central defence Williamson exuded confidence on the ball, not a description you can often attribute to the England captain's usual partner, Millie Bright. Despite England conceding two disappointing goals in the Brazil loss, Williamson was an asset for her team, and she reaffirmed that with another assured display against Portugal.\n\nHer emergence as a starter has been aided by injuries which have kept Bright and Abbie McManus out of the running during this international break, but many would argue it has been a long time coming. Williamson has played consistently for WSL champions Arsenal since last season, and Neville revealed this week that he receives \"about 20 direct messages on Instagram a day\" from fans asking why he was not playing Williamson more regularly.\n\nHer bit-part role for England at the World Cup this summer, where she accumulated just six minutes of game time, was something Neville said on Monday was a \"disappointment\" for him.", "description": "The main positives for England to take from their worst run in seven years are Leah Williamson's performances this past week.", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee", "Sam Wallace", "Luke Edwards"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212458582-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqb1PXEmBvOgdkNRrMiZFIJDlfanSBx7_j1KSp5m7WJo8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
