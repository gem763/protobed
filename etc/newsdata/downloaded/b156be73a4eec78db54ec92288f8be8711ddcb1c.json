I can point to the First Amendment protecting their freedom of speech, but I can\u2019t point to anything that explicitly says men and women are people of equal stature,\u201d she said, holding her pocket Constitution.\n\nShe said she would like to be able to tell her grandchildren the equal stature between men and women is part of the country\u2019s legal system, but she acknowledged the U.S. Constitution is hard to amend.\n\nThe Equal Rights Amendment had been a cause in the 1970s, when it cleared both chambers of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification. It fell short when the required three-fourths of states had not ratified it by its original 1979 deadline nor an extended 1982 deadline signed in to law by President Jimmy Carter in 1978.\n\nOpponents of the measure, led chiefly in the 1970s by the late conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, warned the amendment would have led to women being forced to serve in the military and the loss of alimony, among other protections.\n\nThirty-five states had approved the ERA before the ratification deadline, leaving it three shy of the 38 needed to be added to the Constitution.\n\nEarlier this year, House Democrats held the first hearing in more than three decades on the Equal Rights Amendment, hoping to revive the proposal.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
