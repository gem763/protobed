The 22-year-old made manager Dave Martinez look like a genius for plugging him right back into center field despite Michael A. Taylor\u2019s homer in Game 2.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a debate for Martinez, who Sunday said Robles would \u201cget a chance to play\u201d over Taylor when 100% healthy. Robles took swings in the batting cage and made it an easy decision.\n\n\u201cHe ran the bases (Sunday) and ran them at full tilt,\u201d Martinez said before the game. \u201cHe looked really good.\u201d\n\nHis swings against Cardinals pitching looked even better. Robles, batting eighth, lined a base hit up the middle off starter Jack Flaherty in the third inning and crushed reliever John Brebbia\u2019s 2-1 fastball over the fence in right center in the sixth.\n\nRobles hit .255 with 17 home runs, 65 RBIs and 28 stolen bases during his first full season in the majors. He had last played in Game 2 of the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe Cardinals made only one lineup change after putting up just one run on four hits in the first two games. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez started in right field, with Tommy Edman shifting to third base in place of Matt Carpenter.\n\n\u201cJos\u00e9 has just had good at-bats, putting good swings on the baseball,\u201d manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cJust looking to mix it up a bit, nothing too crazy, obviously. But Jos\u00e9\u2019s earned the opportunity to get in there and create some length in the lineup and in a spot where guys are doing their part in front of him and he can do some damage.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Victor Robles made an immediate impact in his return to the Washington Nationals' lineup.
