In their announcement, the IIHS noted that the Tesla Model 3 \u201cearns good ratings across the board for crashworthiness\u201d and specifically noted a superior rating for its standard front crash prevention system. It is Tesla\u2019s first-ever safety award and two years removed from a ho-hum \"acceptable\" rating given for their 2017 model.\n\nThis is welcome news for Tesla, who has had some struggles keeping insurance rates for drivers down. In large part due to high expenses for fixing and maintaining the vehicle, Tesla\u2019s insurance has cost consumers as much as ensuring a luxury car.\n\nThe high rating from the IIHS should calm some of those fears. In an effort to combat high insurance rates, Tesla unveiled its own insurance company in late August. First offered in California, there are plans to expand into other states.\n\nBut is it enough to help push Tesla mainstream?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg TSLA TESLA INC. 246.60 +3.11 +1.28%\n\nGabe Hoffman, founder of Accipiter Capital Management and someone who has been critical of Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, doesn\u2019t think the safety rating will move the meter all that much for the company. Of the safety rating, Hoffman said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure it really matters in light of the substantial quality issues that they have.\u201d Tesla has noted logistical and service issues throughout its production history.\n\n\u201cThe ownership compared to a normal car is completely miserable. You\u2019re talking about insurance costs that are about 70 percent higher than an [Internal Combustion Engine] car of the same price,\u201d Hoffman told FOX Business. \u201cYou have to wait a tremendous amount of time for repairs and spare parts. Plus you have quality issues that are so much more important.\u201d\n\nThe safety rating news was tweeted by both Tesla and Musk on Thursday morning.\n\nThe buzz about the safety report is a welcome U-turn for Tesla. The IIHS rating for the Model 3 comes just weeks after claims from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that Tesla had mischaracterized and exaggerated crash-test results.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe rating partners with good news for economy drivers wanting to wade into the market for electric cars. The Model 3 is the most affordable offering from the company, a fact made easier on the wallet by what will likely be slightly lower insurance premiums for drivers.", "description": "Tesla's Model 3 achieves first ever safety rating, welcome news for consumers who pay a premium for insurance to drive the electric car.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/AP19142678009836.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
