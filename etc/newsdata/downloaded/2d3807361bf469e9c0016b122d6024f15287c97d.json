REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nBERN (Reuters) - The Swiss parliament on Wednesday approved Attorney General Michael Lauber for a third term, opting for continuity despite disciplinary proceedings against him triggered by his handling of a soccer corruption probe.\n\nThe narrow vote keeping Lauber attorney general through 2023 contradicted a parliamentary committee\u2019s recommendation against his re-election this month. It had said a scandal surrounding undocumented meetings he held with FIFA President Gianni Infantino had damaged the reputation of Switzerland\u2019s highest prosecutorial office and put federal attorneys\u2019 ability to act at risk.\n\nLauber held at least three confidential meetings in 2016 and 2017 with Infantino while his office was carrying out an investigation into several cases of suspected corruption involving Zurich-based FIFA. The prosecutor has defended his office\u2019s handling of the case.\n\nWhile Lauber had acknowledged two meetings with Infantino that occurred in 2016, he had denied a third meeting reported by media, prompting a disciplinary probe. He later said he did not recall the third meeting but that it must have occurred based on diary entries and text messages.\n\nWith 129 votes, Lauber eked out the majority he needed to stay in his role after some lawmakers spoke out in favor of keeping his office running smoothly and not prejudging his actions before the disciplinary probe wraps up.\n\n\u201cIt is important to me as a member of parliament that institutions continue to function properly,\u201d said Christian Luescher of the pro-business Liberals, warning against making the attorney general\u2019s office a political football.\n\nA tense-looking Lauber watched from the visitors gallery during parliament\u2019s debate, his jaw working furiously.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to parliament for the confidence it has placed in me,\u201d he said after the vote. \u201cStrengthened by this election I will continue to commit myself to an effective, independent and modern prosecution.\u201d", "description": "The Swiss parliament on Wednesday approved Attorney General Michael Lauber for a third term, opting for continuity despite disciplinary proceedings against him triggered by his handling of a soccer corruption probe.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433660891&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0E5", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
