USA TODAY\n\nAs usual, not much movement at the top of the rankings but plenty of it at the bottom.\n\nAlabama still isn't going anywhere. The champ sits at the top until someone knocks em off. LSU has the best chance of anyone to do that in two weeks. It's almost time, everybody!\n\n1. Alabama (8-0, 5-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 1\n\nBackup quarterback, 41-point victory. That's what happens when the best team in the conference plays the worst at home. Sophomore QB Mac Jones lit Arkansas up, but the Crimson Tide sure hopes junior Tua Tagovailoa is ready to go on Nov. 9.\n\nUp next: Nov. 9 vs. LSU, 3:30 p.m. ET, CBS.\n\nAlabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, hugs fellow quarterback Mac Jones (10) during the Crimson Tide's game against Arkansas on Oct. 26, 2019.

None of them matter if LSU can't notch a fourth against Alabama in two weeks though.\n\nUp next: Nov. 9 at Alabama, 3:30 p.m., CBS.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nRE-RANK: Oklahoma falls to No. 9 and the American Athletic shows strength\n\nTIGERS MOVE UP: LSU now No. 2 behind Alabama in Amway Coaches poll\n\n3. Florida (7-1, 4-1 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 3\n\nYou have to think last year's 19-point loss to Georgia stuck with Florida head coach Dan Mullen for a while. This week is the Gators' chance for revenge. A win would put them in the driver's seat to win the SEC East.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Georgia, 3:30 p.m., CBS.\n\n4. Georgia (6-1, 3-1 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 5\n\nLast week's bye week couldn't have come at a better time for Georgia. The Bulldogs were reeling after a loss to South Carolina and a lackluster win over Kentucky. If they play like they did in those two games this week against Florida, it won't end well.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Florida, 3:30 p.m., CBS\n\n5. Auburn (6-2, 3-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 4\n\nAuburn was nearly doubled up in yards gained by LSU last weekend, but the scoreboard still showed a narrow defeat on the road. The clash of the Tigers was close throughout the day. The visiting version of the Tigers earned a lot of respect across the nation for nearly taking down the ones that call Death Valley home in their own house.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Ole Miss, 7 p.m., ESPN.\n\n6. Texas A&M (5-3, 3-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 6\n\nThe Aggies have won consecutive games for the first time all season with a third victory in a row imminent this week. Junior quarterback Kellen Mond is perhaps playing the best football of his career.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Texas-San Antonio, noon, SEC Network.\n\n7. Tennessee (3-5, 2-3 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 9\n\nThis is the highest Tennessee has been ranked in these rankings this season and it's probably as high as the Volunteers will ever get. But they deserve it. The last four weeks have been good for the Vols; competitive losses to Georgia and Alabama and wins over Mississippi State and South Carolina.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Alabama-Birmingham, 7 p.m., ESPNU.\n\n8. Mississippi (3-5, 2-3 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 10\n\nAh, the pleasure of not having to step onto a field and still moving up two spaces in the rankings. Ole Miss obviously didn't do anything to slide up. It's what they didn't do that has the Rebels here, though. They didn't suffer bad losses like teams lower in the rankings did.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Auburn, 7 p.m., ESPN.\n\n9. South Carolina (3-5, 2-4 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 7\n\nJust when you thought the Gamecocks were on their way to six wins and a bowl berth, they go out and lose to Tennessee. Now South Carolina has to find three wins against Vanderbilt, Appalachian State, Texas A&M and Clemson to make it to the postseason.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Vanderbilt, 7:30 p.m., SEC Network.\n\n10. Kentucky (4-4, 2-4 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 12\n\nKentucky has now manufactured two wins while starting a wide receiver at quarterback. The Wildcats ran for 297 yards on Missouri last week to take pressure off Lynn Bowden, who only threw the ball seven times.\n\nUp next: Nov. 9 vs. Tennessee.\n\n11. Missouri (5-3, 2-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 8\n\nIt was all a tease. Missouri actually had folks thinking it could win the SEC East. Now the Tigers have two SEC losses and have to play the division's top two teams in successive weeks. Those losses on the Tigers ledger, by the way, are to the division's two worst teams in the standings: Vanderbilt and Kentucky.\n\nUp next: Nov. 9 at Georgia\n\n12. Mississippi State (3-5, 1-4 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 11\n\nThe Bulldogs have lost four games in a row for the first time since 2005. If the slide continues at Arkansas this week, head coach Joe Moorhead will never hear the end of it from a fan base that has already had enough.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Arkansas, 4 p.m., SEC Network.\n\n13. Vanderbilt (2-5, 1-4 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 13\n\nYou can't lose when you don't play. Bye weeks must be nice for teams like Vanderbilt.\n\nUp next: Saturday at South Carolina, 7:30 p.m., SEC Network.\n\n14. Arkansas (2-6, 0-5 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 14\n\nYou can lose when you do play. Arkansas got drubbed by Alabama but has a chance to get its first SEC win under Chad Morris' leadership when Mississippi State limps into town this weekend.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Mississippi State, 4 p.m., SEC Network.", "description": "Alabama and LSU continue to lead the SEC power rankings ahead of their Nov. 9 clash.
