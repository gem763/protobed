But his campaign never caught fire: He qualified for the first two rounds of Democratic presidential debates but has failed to make the cut for the others.\n\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics average, de Blasio was polling at less than 1 percent nationally. The Democrat had recently hinted that he would end his long-shot bid if he didn't qualify for the October debates.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to do everything I know how to get into them,\" de Blasio said earlier this month.\n\nBut Blasio faced an extremely uphill climb to meet the debate thresholds ahead of the Oct. 1 qualifying deadline.\n\nPresident Trump mocked the mayor in a tweet Friday morning.\n\n\"Oh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years!\" the president tweeted. \"Part time Mayor of New York City, @BilldeBlasio, who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race. NYC is devastated, he\u2019s coming home!\"\n\nOn his campaign's first day, de Blasio dived into an insult match with Trump. \"He's a con artist. I know his tricks. I know his playbook,\" the mayor said.\n\nTrump tweeted in response at the time that de Blasio was \"considered the worst mayor in the U.S.\"\n\nThe Republican president said, \"He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he's your man. NYC HATES HIM!\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen de Blasio took office in 2014, he seemed briefly poised to become a leading voice for an emerging left wing of the Democratic Party. His central message was fighting income inequality, a theme he hit in the video announcing his presidential candidacy.\n\n\"There's plenty of money in this world. There's plenty of money in this country. It's just in the wrong hands,\" he said.\n\nLiberal enthusiasm faded during his first term, partly because of political missteps.\n\nJust this week, Hollywood comedian and lifetime New Yorker Billy Crystal called on the mayor to get out of the race.\n\n\u201cDe Blasio, what are you doing in Iowa? You\u2019re going nowhere, come back and clean up this city,\u201d Crystal said on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday he is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, ending his campaign after struggling to gain traction in the race.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
