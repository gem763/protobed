He returns to the role in the Netflix movie \"El Camino,\" out Friday. (Oct. 9) AP, AP\n\n\"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\" has failed to rev everyone's engine.\n\nNetflix's two-hour film, which picks up in the moments after the 2013 finale of the AMC series starring Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, dropped Friday, and the reviews are in. (The flick is also available for viewing in select theaters.)\n\nSome critics are questioning the necessity of the movie written and directed by Vince Gilligan, who created the original drama about a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher Walter White (Cranston), who becomes a meth manufacturer aided by his partner and former student Jesse Pinkman (Paul).\n\nBefore taking in the feature, see what the critics are saying. (The Metacritic aggregation site currently lists a rating of 72 out of 100).\n\n'It felt like a 'Star Wars' set': Aaron Paul on making the top-secret 'Breaking Bad' movie\n\n'You ready?': The latest 'Breaking Bad' trailer shows Jesse Pinkman on the run again\n\n\"Fans may get a kick out of revisiting old haunts and reconnecting with familiar faces, at least one of whom who made the jump from 'Breaking Bad' to the brilliant spinoff, 'Better Call Saul.' However, there aren\u2019t enough of those reunions, at least with key figures, to gird a strong, compelling tale that connects past with present.\n\n\"'El Camino' isn\u2019t horrible, but it\u2019s not commendable either, and given the legacy of 'Breaking Bad,' mildly entertaining isn\u2019t good enough.\"\n\n\"'El Camino' is a high-quality piece of suspense and action filmmaking carried by Paul's still-tremendous performance as Jesse Pinkman. It looks great, sounds great and if you're a fan, it's full of cameos and references that are sure to amuse. It's also \u2013 and this is not an insignificant problem \u2013 largely unnecessary as it pertains to the larger 'Breaking Bad' narrative. At least it's unnecessary in an innocuous and entertaining way. It doesn't do any harm. It just gives answers I'm not sure I cared about to questions I'm not sure I asked.\"\n\n\"El Camino is a playful project, very fun, not always necessary. It\u2019s an alternate series finale, a reunion special \u2013 and, maybe, an elaborate make-good. I love a lot of 'Breaking Bad,' and I still think the show whiffed when it mostly banished Jesse in the last few episodes. His central role became a sidelong ramification, one more piece of collateral damage in the fallrise of Walter White (Bryan Cranston).\n\n\"Not a big deal, maybe; Paul won his third Emmy for that season. Did Gilligan feel, deep down, like he owed the character something more? With Walt left for dead in the 'Bad' finale, 'El Camino' becomes Jesse\u2019s story, through and through.\"\n\nEarly ratings hits and misses: 'Stumptown,' 'Prodigal Son' lead TV's new season\n\nAaron Paul stars in Netflix's \"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,\" now available for streaming. (Photo: Ben Rothstein/Netflix via AP)\n\n\"'El Camino,' out today, lives up to 'Breaking Bad\u2019s' legacy of propulsive storytelling. The film is a visceral, ruminative, and emotionally satisfying epilogue in which the broken Jesse reconciles with his past and searches for the hope and humanity he\u2019d lost \u2013 or, rather, been denied by Walt.\"\n\n\"'El Camino' began life as a short film Gilligan wanted to make for the series\u2019 10th anniversary. Though it expanded to feature length... it still feels like the gift to fans it was originally designed to be, rather than something essential to the larger 'Breaking Bad' experience. But when you have Vince Gilligan operating near the peak of his powers, and taking the time to fix one of the few things the show didn\u2019t get quite right, it makes for one hell of an entertaining gift.\"\n\n\u201c'El Camino' makes choices that limit its success and that don\u2019t serve the legacy of 'Breaking Bad.' But its arrival at a place of wholeness after two hours of painful anxiety suggest that, though the path Gilligan and company took was at times a dubious one, 'El Camino' can\u2019t, finally, be said to have lost its way.\"\n\n\"Aside from a few unnecessary character cameos, most of which you could easily guess but none of which I will spoil here, 'El Camino' avoids the pitfalls of this year\u2019s many feature-length sequels to TV shows. There\u2019s little of the fan-service inanity that abounded in the 'Downton Abbey' film and none of the sentimental self-indulgence of 'Transparent\u2019s' insufferable musical finale. Like AMC\u2019s 'Breaking Bad' prequel 'Better Call Saul,' as well as morally flexible saloon owner Al Swearengen\u2019s (Ian McShane) storyline in HBO\u2019s 'Deadwood: The Movie,' it completes the unfinished portrait of a character who remains on viewers\u2019 minds.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/11/el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-netflix-reviews/3942391002/", "description": "\"('El Camino') doesn't do any harm.
