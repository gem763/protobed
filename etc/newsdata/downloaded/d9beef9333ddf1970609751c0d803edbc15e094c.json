Sales are rising, while shares of AMD stock have surged more than 900% since its all-time lows reached a few years ago. And now it seems that it\u2019s chief rivals are starting to run scared.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is being forced to dramatically cut prices for its chipsets in order to compete with AMD and its more advanced products. INTC seeing declining market share and such an aggressive pricing policy underscores that Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 strategy is working. That should put a huge smile on AMD stock investors\u2019 faces.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the end, AMD could finally gain the crown after so many years as the underdog.\n\nAMD Has the Goods\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about it before, but AMD can\u2019t be considered a distant second fiddle to Intel any longer. The key for the semiconductor leader comes down to innovation. During the dotcom boom, AMD\u2019s chips were often seen as the cheap alternative to Intel\u2019s products. Sure, they did the job and cost less, but if you needed real computing power or needed to run a server, you went with INTC\u2019s semis.\n\nHowever, over the last couple of years that started to change. Thanks to advances across its entire semiconductor line-up, AMD\u2019s chipsets have started to perform better than Intel\u2019s in a variety of ways. Its third-generation Ryzen chips for PC are simply a monster when it comes to computing power. The chips can come with an amazing 12 cores, while a 16-core chip is being launched before the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, it has been able to apply this innovation across a few other avenues as well. AMD\u2019s EPYC server chips express similar high speeds of processing capacity, while its advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) has found a place in the cloud. Thanks to their rapid speed at processing information, GPUs have quickly become the go-to chips in many data centers that power A.I., healthcare, science, and engineering applications.\n\nAs if the computing power wasn\u2019t enough, Advanced Micro Devices semiconductors are kicking Chipzilla\u2019s butt in another way. That comes down to pricing. Since AMD has long been the cheaper option for CPUs, the firm has kept its prices low. With better performance metrics and cheaper prices, the firm started to see it\u2019s market share climb significantly.\n\nIndustry group Mercury Research\u2019s latest report highlights just how powerful AMD has become. According to Mercury\u2019s numbers from the second-quarter 2019, Advanced Micro Devices held 17.1% of the CPU market. That\u2019s up from just 12.3% a year ago. The same could be said for servers- with AMD seeing its market share just from less-than-1% to nearly 3% of the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Has INTC Scared\n\nFor INTC, this slippage in market share hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. As we said, Intel has long been able to charge premium prices for its premium chips. But with AMD now catching-up and surpassing its own offerings, Intel has been forced to do something it hasn\u2019t done in a very long time and that\u2019s cut prices.\n\nLast week, Intel announced a new group of X-series chips that promise similar computing power to many of AMD\u2019s Ryzen products. The kicker was that prices for these chips were significantly lower than before. For example, back in 2017, INTC was able to charge $1,199 for its 12-core processor chip. Now it\u2019s less than $700. Its most advanced chip in the line-up has had its price cut more than half.\n\nHowever, that not enough and Intel is still worried about losing more market share to AMD. In a leaked internal slide show dubbed \u201cAMD Competitive Profile,\u201d INTC estimates that it has to cough up an additional $3 billion worth of discounts and other incentives for its Core and Xeon processor line-ups in order to keep the fight vs. AMD going.", "description": "It's amazing just how fast fortunes can change in the technology sector.
