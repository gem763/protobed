Can I Say That?\"", "language": "en", "text": "Could there be any profession less eco-friendly than Formula 1 motor-racing?\n\nDutch F1 driver Max Verstappen doesn\u2019t think so. And now he is taking a stand against those of his competitors who have come over all green and squeamish about the ethical implications of motor sport.\n\nAccording to France 24:\n\nVerstappen said: \u201cYeah, I like fuel. Can I say that? I don\u2019t like electric stuff. Well, I like my little electric moped at home, but not for an F1 car. \u201cI know the environment is very important, but F1 has been around for a long time as well and I don\u2019t think we should over-react or be drama queen about it.\u201d Speaking ahead of Sunday\u2019s Mexico Grand Prix he added: \u201cJust get on with it. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t watch it\u2026.\u201d\n\nVerstappen\u2019s position is in marked contrast to that of British F1 champion Lewis Hamilton, who recently urged his fans to go vegan as \u201cthe only way to save the planet\u201d.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of principled position you can afford to take when you are personally worth $500 million, are sponsored by a Malaysian oil and gas company (Petronas), and your earn your living flying round the world in order to race round a track burning up fuel and rubber.\n\nLewis Hamilton; Owns a \u00a325 million private jet. Races cars for a living. Has a \u00a313 million car collection. Owns a \u00a33 million yacht. Avoided taxes on his jet using tax avoidance scheme. Sponsored by Petronas, a Malaysian oil and gas company Lewis Hamilton is a Grade A tw*t! https://t.co/YpeFzikP79 \u2014 Mark (@markantro) October 15, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a measure of the stupidity, hypocrisy and virtue-signalling now rampant in international sport that, instead of laughing at Hamilton, at least one of his fellow F1 champions chose to support him.\n\nOn Thursday four-time champion Sebastian Vettel \u2014 according to France 24 \u2014 \u201curged Formula One to step in and play a more positive role in the climate change crisis.\u201d\n\nOthers, though, aren\u2019t playing this silly game.\n\nVettel\u2019s former Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, now of Alfa Romeo, said that if the sport became too involved \u201cwe should all stay home and forget the racing\u201d. \u201cObviously, I think it involves everybody who lives on this planet,\u201d Raikkonen added. \u201cIn the end, we all try to do what we can, but honestly we are probably not in the best place to start making big stories out of it because we\u2019re burning fuel for what? To be first, second?\u201d\n\nI think I know who I want to win in Mexico this weekend. And it certainly ain\u2019t tofu-munching, kilt-wearing, eco-loon Hamilton.", "description": "Could there be any profession less eco-friendly than Formula 1 motor-racing?Dutch F1 driver Max Verstappen doesn't think so.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Max-Verstappen-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
