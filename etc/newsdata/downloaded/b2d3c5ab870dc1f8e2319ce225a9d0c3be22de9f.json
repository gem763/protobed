It's possible that those new demands forced the Edomites to adopt different innovations.\n\n\"We are going to continue and explore the regional connections of this kingdom, to see if we see any evidence for their connections with other kingdoms in the region, including Ancient Israel,\" Ben-Yosef told LiveScience.", "description": "A mysterious kingdom from Biblical times that underwent a major technological transformation almost 3,000 years ago might have been influenced by the Egyptians.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/erez-ben-yosef-excavation-image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
