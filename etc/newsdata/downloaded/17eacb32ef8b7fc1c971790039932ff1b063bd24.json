Both decisions were mocked and defended, crystallizing just how disputed the terrain of content moderation on platforms has become. The idea of \u201ca platform\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense anymore, and it\u2019s being challenged from every direction.\n\nBeyond the Maza-Crowder dispute, just in the past week, researchers demonstrated that YouTube\u2019s algorithm seemed to lead users to sexualized videos of children, and The New York Times ran a front-page story about how a young man was radicalized by right-wing videos on the site.\n\nTo defend themselves, the so-called platforms have developed byzantine sets of rules. If they follow the guidelines they make up, they say, they are fulfilling their obligations to their various kinds of users. This week, YouTube\u2019s CEO, Susan Wojcicki, tried to explain her company\u2019s actions at the Code Conference. She mentioned the word policies 14 times. \u201cWe need to have consistent policies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be enforced in a consistent way. We have thousands of reviewers across the globe. We need to make sure that we\u2019re providing consistency.\u201d Of course, the policies are always changing and can be revisited at any time, and yet these inconsistent rules will be enforced consistently. It\u2019s a mess.\n\nEven simple brand-promotion moments have become complicated. YouTube\u2019s annual \u201cRewind\u201d video, which the brand uses as a showcase for its stars, has become a battleground about what YouTube is. When last year\u2019s version left out old-school YouTubers such as the controversial PewDiePie, it became the most disliked video in the site\u2019s history. Fans who saw themselves as part of the \u201creal\u201d YouTube community panned YouTube for catering to more advertising-friendly, professional creators. \u201cThe community, which was once celebrated by YouTube, no longer feels included in the culture YouTube wants to promote,\u201d The Verge summarized.\n\nMany disputes\u2014about \u201ccommunity,\u201d white-supremacist content, online harassment, or the supposed liberal bias of these services\u2014devolve into the carefully massaged language of some policy team. Perhaps the labor model of content moderation is questioned, or the accuracy or ethics of particular algorithmic decisions.\n\nDon\u2019t let the minutiae distract from what\u2019s really happening: An era-defining way of thinking about the internet\u2014\u201cthe platform\u201d\u2014has become unstable.\n\nThere was a time when there were no \u201cplatforms\u201d as we now know them. That time was, oh, about 2007. For decades, computing (video games included) had had this term \u201cplatform.\u201d As the 2000s began, Tim O\u2019Reilly and John Battelle proposed \u201cthe web as a platform,\u201d primarily focusing on the ability of different services to connect to one another.\n\nThe venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, then the CEO of the also-ran social network Ning, blasted anyone who wanted to extend the definition. \u201cA \u2018platform\u2019 is a system that can be programmed and therefore customized by outside developers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe key term in the definition of platform is \u2018programmed.\u2019 If you can program it, then it\u2019s a platform. If you can\u2019t, then it\u2019s not.\u201d My colleague Ian Bogost, who co-created an MIT book series called Platform Studies, agreed, as did most people in the technical community. Platforms were about being able to run code in someone else\u2019s system.", "description": "For years, tech companies have relied on a rhetorical sleight of hand.
