It's hard not to when you go anywhere and you see your face on the front of a newspaper or you turn the telly on and people are talking about you.\n\n\"It's not like they're talking about little things, they're talking about stuff that can change your life, really.\n\n\"But the expectation is half what I've done as well and it's probably a good thing. It just goes to show that I did impress people when I played last year.\n\n\"For me, it's about not listening to them and sticking to what I do.\"\n\nLongstaff found himself thrust into the limelight when then manager Rafael Benitez handed him a top-flight debut as a substitute in a 4-0 defeat at title-chasing Liverpool on Boxing Day last year.\n\nHe will return to Anfield on Saturday, this time under Steve Bruce, with his stock having risen significantly, to the extent that he has been mentioned as a future England international, although he can still count on relative anonymity even on Tyneside.\n\nLongstaff recently moved out of the family home and into his own abode, and has since discovered - through a conversation about last month's 1-0 victory at Tottenham, in which record signing Joelinton scored the winner - that at least one of his neighbours does not yet know who he is.\n\nHe said: \"He was reading the newspaper and big Joe was on the front and he stopped me and started speaking, and I could tell he didn't realise I'd played.\n\n\"He was talking about how good Joe was and how good the result was at Spurs. He turned the page and I was on it, and I had to stop myself from laughing, and then he was talking about me.\n\n\"I thought, 'I hope he's not going to slag me off here, I hope he's not going to batter me', which was pretty funny, but he said some nice things.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Newcastle\u00a0midfielder Sean Longstaff has admitted summer speculation over a move to Manchester United was a distraction to him.
