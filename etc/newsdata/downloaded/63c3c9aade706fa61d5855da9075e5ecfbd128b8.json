After debating its \u201clapability,\u201d its lack of USB-C ports, and its staid design, I\u2019ve used the Surface Pro 6 on and off as a regular laptop for nearly 12 months now. I\u2019ve been trying to think of why I\u2019ve picked the Surface Pro over the many other laptops I\u2019ve also been testing, and it comes down to a unique mix of hardware. It\u2019s small and light enough to slip into a variety of bags when I travel, and I can transform it into different modes so I can work on trains, planes, and everywhere else. These are all things Surface Pro owners have known for years, it just took me a little longer to discover them myself.\n\nSo when I picked up the Surface Pro 7 last week for this review, it felt very familiar. I called the Surface Pro 6 a familiar bet last year, and this time around the Pro 7 is an equally familiar bet. You could now place four year\u2019s worth of Surface Pro devices next to each other, and they\u2019d all look identical. This is yet another minor refresh for the Surface Pro line, and the design I really want on this hardware (slimmer display bezels, rounded edges, and built-in LTE) is coming next month with the Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro X.\n\nThankfully, Microsoft has finally added USB-C this time around and the performance and general usability has improved as you\u2019d expect with the latest generation processors and hardware. I just wish the Surface Pro 7 looked like a Surface Pro X with an Intel chip inside.\n\nOur review of Microsoft Surface Pro 7 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Quad-core performance is great inside this lightweight tablet\n\nCool and quiet with quick resume\n\nUSB-C, finally! Bad Stuff Still no Thunderbolt 3\n\nDated design that looks old next to a Surface Pro X\n\nLack of built-in LTE / removable SSDs Buy for $749.00 from Microsoft Buy for $899.00 from Best Buy\n\nThe new Surface Pro 7 starts at $749 this year, which is $150 less than last year\u2019s base model. Microsoft dropped the Intel Core i3 model last year, and bumped the RAM up to a reasonable 8GB. Sadly, this year we\u2019re back to the Core i3 base model with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. I\u2019ve been testing a Core i5 model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage ($1,199), and it\u2019s hard to recommend a Core i3 model with just 4GB of RAM. For most people, the $899 Core i5 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage should be sufficient, providing you\u2019re mostly using cloud storage options. You\u2019ll need to step up to the $1,199 model I\u2019ve been testing for a black variant \u2014 the base versions are only available in silver.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 7 specs Display: 12.3-inch, 2736 x 1824 (267 PPI) touchscreen, 3:2 aspect ratio\n\nDimensions: 292 mm x 201 mm x 8.5 mm\n\nWeight: 1.7lbs (i3 and i5) 1.74lbs (i7)\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i3, i5, or i7\n\nRAM: Up 16GB LPDDR4x (non-upgradable)\n\nStorage: Up to 1TB SSD\n\nWireless: Wi-Fi 6: 802.11ax compatible, Bluetooth\u00ae 5.0. No LTE option.\n\nPorts: 1 USB-C, 1 USB-A, 3.5mm headphone jack, Surface Connect\n\nPrice: $749 to start ($1,199 as tested)\n\nLike always with the Surface Pro, the keyboard isn\u2019t bundled so you\u2019ll also need to spend at least $129.99 on a Surface Type Cover. Without it you\u2019re just getting a tablet, and it\u2019s definitely not the primary way you\u2019ll use the Surface Pro 7. Microsoft also sells covers with Alcantara fabric for $159.99, and there are a few new color options this year. I\u2019ve been testing the Poppy Red Type Cover, which looks like a fall mix of red and orange. Combined with the Type Cover, the realistic entry price is $878.99 for the Core i3 model. You can also purchase an optional Surface Pen for $99.99. All told, the rig I\u2019ve been testing tallies up to two pennies shy of $1,360.\n\nMuch like the Surface Pro 6, the hardware remains very similar on the outside. The big new addition on the Surface Pro 7 is USB-C. It\u2019s been a long time coming, but sadly it doesn\u2019t include Thunderbolt 3 so it\u2019s limited to USB 3.1 speeds (10Gbps). I\u2019m disappointed Microsoft still hasn\u2019t made the switch to Thunderbolt 3, as the dream of using this as a single machine and hooking it up to an external GPU and monitor just isn\u2019t here yet. The USB-C port does let you hook up an external monitor directly, or you can plug into one of the USB-C docks that have flooded the market to get more ports. Naturally, you can also use this to charge the Surface Pro 7 with the same USB-C charger you use on your Android phone, or to attach accessories. Microsoft still includes its regular Surface Connect magnetic charging port, too so all older chargers and accessories will work just fine.\n\nWith most of the hardware unchanged from the outside, it\u2019s really the internals of the Surface Pro 7 that have changed once again this year. Microsoft has placed Intel\u2019s 10th Gen processors inside the Pro 7, and you can pick between a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 variant. I\u2019ve been using the Surface Pro 6 with an 8th Gen Core i7 over the past year, and I\u2019ve been impressed with its performance. It\u2019s equally impressive here, and the Surface Pro 7 remains silent even during times when I pushed it with some video editing.\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that instant on seems to finally be working with the Surface Pro 7. I\u2019ve heard promises of being able to stop working and instantly resume hours later in the past but I\u2019ve found that most Surface Pro models simply go into a deep hibernation after just a few hours of not being used. Even the quick resume on the Surface Pro 6 wasn\u2019t always snappy as you\u2019d have to wait for the Windows Hello camera to wake up occasionally. The Surface Pro 7 feels different and far more responsive. Every time I\u2019ve left it for a few hours, it instantly wakes and Windows Hello logs me in before I\u2019ve even got the kickstand fully in position.\n\nAgree to Continue: Microsoft Surface Pro 7 Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. As with other Windows 10 computers, the Surface Pro 7 presents you with multiple things to agree or decline upon setup. The mandatory policies, which agreement is required to use the laptop are: Windows 10 License Agreement\n\nA Microsoft account for sign in (this can be bypassed if you don\u2019t connect the computer to the internet during setup) In addition, there are a slew of optional things to agree to: Activity History\n\nOneDrive back up\n\nOffice 365\n\nCortana (which allows Microsoft to access your location, location history, contacts, voice input, speech and handwriting patterns, typing history, search history, calendar details, messages, apps and Edge browsing history)\n\nDevice Privacy settings: online speech recognition, Find My Device, Inking and Typing, Advertising ID, Location, Diag data, Tailored experiences Add it all up and you have two mandatory agreements and eleven optional ones.\n\nOn the Surface Pro 6 you have to tap the power button to get it to wake up, but on the Pro 7 it just resumes instantly when you fold open the keyboard. This is a great usability improvement, but it also means Microsoft has tweaked the way this device goes into hibernation. On last year\u2019s Surface Pro 6 it would hold in a standby state for six hours, allowing you to instantly resume. With the Surface Pro 7, it will hold in standby for a massive 72 hours.\n\nThe most obvious tradeoff for this constant quick resume feature is battery life. I left the Surface Pro 7 with 86 percent battery life at 11AM one day, and resumed using it nine hours later at 8PM to find it had 80 percent battery left. That\u2019s less than one percent per hour, and definitely worth the small drain tradeoff for instant wake. The Surface Pro 7 also has a quick charge feature, allowing you to get to 80 percent battery life in an hour. I found it takes roughly an hour and 40 minutes to get to full charge from nothing at all.\n\nSpeaking of battery life, I haven\u2019t seen any major improvements this generation. On average I\u2019d get around 7 to 8 hours of battery life using a mix of apps like Chrome, Word, Discord, Twitter, Spotify, and more. If I watched more web video, or graphically intensive apps / web pages then this could drop to around 6 hours.\n\nThat\u2019s practically the same as my experience with last year\u2019s Surface Pro 6. I\u2019ve been using that device regularly, and it\u2019s mostly enough to cover you for a day of work but you\u2019ll always need the charger with you just in case. I\u2019m hoping the Surface Pro X will offer the ability to not have to carry around a charger as much, and here\u2019s hoping that Microsoft improves the main Pro hardware next time around.\n\nI wrote last year that the Surface Pro deserves a bigger refresh, and it still does. I still love this hardware, and being able to squeeze into a tight train seat and work using full desktop apps is still a big selling point for me. But the Surface Pro X has left me feeling more excited, and it makes the Surface Pro 7 feel even more dated. I want to see a Surface Pro 8 with slimmer bezels, a rounded chassis, built-in LTE, and removable SSDs, all with the power and legacy app compatibility that Intel\u2019s processors provide.\n\nThe Surface Pro 7 is still best in class, and it\u2019s undoubtedly the 2-in-1 to beat, but there\u2019s more that Microsoft could do here. I do wonder if Microsoft has been waiting on Intel to get its act together on 10nm and beyond, and perhaps opted for the Surface Pro X design with Qualcomm instead. Either way, the usability of the Surface Pro 7 has certainly improved with quick resume and USB-C this year, but things like the clever Surface Slim Pen that slots into the Type Cover on the Surface Pro X just aren\u2019t here. It\u2019s all too familiar.\n\nThe Surface Pro X looks like it\u2019s now attempting to set the stage in terms of raw hardware for competitors to catch up to, and we\u2019ll now need to see if the Pro X can even come close to matching the performance of the Surface Pro 7. That\u2019s highly unlikely, which will leave the Surface Pro 7 needing to catch up to the design of the Surface Pro X next year.\n\nFor now, the Surface Pro 7 still offers everything you\u2019d expect from a Surface Pro, but in a hardware package that\u2019s in need of a little attention. I love the versatility of the Surface Pro 7 hardware, but the Surface Pro X represents the future of this 2-in-1. I just wish the future was here now.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Pro 7 is a refinement over previous models.
