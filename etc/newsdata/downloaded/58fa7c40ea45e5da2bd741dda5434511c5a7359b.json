Prior to the inquiry, some had wondered if taking up impeachment proceedings might divide a Democratic rank-and-file that has been long concerned with other policies like health care and guns. However, these findings suggest that it this is not the case: most moderate Democrats side with liberal Democrats in supporting impeachment proceedings. Of those who say they voted for a Democratic House candidate in 2018, nine in 10 feel this inquiry is necessary.\n\nCharacterizing the president\u2019s actions in particular, just under one-third of Americans say the president\u2019s handling of matters with Ukraine may have been improper but were nonetheless still legal. Just over a quarter, including most Republicans, says the president acted properly. Another four in 10, including most Democrats, feel he has acted illegally.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cbsnews.Com News Trump-Impeachment-Inquiry-Poll-Cbs-News-Poll-Finds-Majority-Of-Americans-And-Democrats-Approve"], "top_image": ""}
