Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\n\nThe United States has never been richer. In 2018, American households boasted a collective net worth of over $98 trillion. If that wealth were divided evenly across the U.S. population, every human being in our country would have roughly $298,000 to their name \u2014 and every family of four would be millionaires.\n\n\n\nFew Americans feel entitled to full communism. But many do have trouble reconciling their nation\u2019s unprecedented wealth with the increasing insecurity of middle-class life. In the 1960s, economists worried that 21st-century Americans would struggle to find purpose once economic progress turned full-time employment into an archaic chore practiced solely by the eccentric, like churning butter or collecting CDs. And yet, in 2019, middle-class Americans are working harder than ever. We were promised flying cars. Instead, we got 60-hour workweeks.\n\nSo, what went wrong? How did we miss the exit for fully automated comfort-plus capitalism?\n\nThis week, an excellent New York Times feature titled \u201cThe Middle-Class Crunch\u201d shed some light onto these questions by dissecting the finances of four model middle-income families, and by illustrating the macroeconomic trends that undergird their disparate struggles.\n\nAfter reading the Times\u2019 report and other recent analyses of our postindustrial discontents, I\u2019ve come to think that the decline of America\u2019s middle class can be attributed to three distinct (though related) policy failures. Namely, the failures to sustain American labor\u2019s bargaining power; to contain rent-seeking in the housing, health-care, and higher education sectors; and to update (and expand) the social welfare state for the 21st-century economy.\n\n1) We let the wages fall too damn low.\n\nThis one is the most familiar (and, as an explanation of middle-class decline, arguably tautological). Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth briefly reviewing the grim facts about working-class wage stagnation in the U.S. and how it came to be. From 1948 to 1973, the median worker\u2019s hourly compensation rose in tandem with productivity. Which is to say: As innovation enabled the U.S. economy to extract more value per hour from the typical worker\u2019s labor, it also enabled that worker to secure a higher rate of compensation. In the disco era, America was 96.7 percent more productive than it had been in 1948, and the median American worker was 91.3 percent better paid than her post-war analogue.\n\nBut then, times changed. Between 1973 and 2013, America\u2019s labor force became 74.4 percent more productive \u2014 but the median U.S. laborer\u2019s paycheck grew just 9.2 percent fatter.\n\nOn one level, it\u2019s a bit unfair to describe this development as a policy failure, since it was at least partly intentional. Amid the stagflation crisis of the 1970s, a consensus formed among policymakers that the excessive bargaining power of American workers had broken the economy. Unionized laborers had secured compensation in excess of their marginal productivity, which had forced firms to raise prices, which had led those workers to demand further wage increases, which had led to further price hikes, which had led to even more excessive wage demands, in an inflationary spiral. Beyond taking a toll on price stability, the greed of our working class was also enabling foreign competitors to eat corporate America\u2019s lunch. The New Deal bargain might have worked in an era when Japan and Western Europe lay in ruins, and American capital reigned supreme. But with Japanese and German industry ascendant, the U.S. could no longer afford to coddle its proletariat. Thus, to get a handle on inflation, protect the U.S. dollar, and restore our firms\u2019 global competitiveness, wages would have to go down. Or, as Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker put it in 1979, \u201cThe standard of living of the average American has to decline.\u201d To that end, Volcker engineered a recession by raising interest rates to unprecedented heights. This policy had its intended effects; many a worker\u2019s will and union were broken. Inflation was licked.\n\nBut Ronald Reagan\u2019s election ensured that the war on workers would persist even after price stability was restored. His firing of the PATCO strikers signaled that Uncle Sam no longer frowned on union-busting. Corporate America kicked its class war into a higher gear. Over the ensuing decades, as automation and globalization reordered the U.S. economy \u2014 and shrank the heavily unionized manufacturing sector \u2014 policymakers in both parties did little-to-nothing to facilitate the expansion of collective bargaining into service industries. As a result, America\u2019s unionization rate fell by more than half between 1980 and 2018. This development, combined with a monetary policy that continued to prioritize low inflation over full employment, largely explain the decline in labor\u2019s share of productivity gains.\n\nSome may reject this analysis, on the grounds that the stagnation of middle-class wages in the U.S. is the result of ineluctable economic forces. After all, in recent decades, such stagnation has been ubiquitous throughout developed countries, despite their profoundly different policy environments and rates of unionization.\n\nThere are a lot of problems with this argument. But the most fundamental is that America\u2019s workers have suffered a far greater setback than their Western European peers. Between 1995 and 2013, labor\u2019s share of national income in the U.S. dropped by 8 percentage points, a steeper decline than in any other nation except for South Korea and Poland, according to a 2018 OECD report.\n\nAnd the American capitalist class has been claiming an exceptionally high share of national income for much longer than just two decades \u2014 as this stunning chart from the 2018 World Inequality Report makes clear:\n\nAll this said, tepid wage gains are still wage gains. If eviscerating workers\u2019 bargaining power had been our policymakers\u2019 only sin, America\u2019s contemporary middle class would enjoy more economic security than its predecessors. Unfortunately:\n\n2) We let the costs of housing, health care, and higher education rise too damn high.\n\nIf you\u2019re already growing tired of skimming this article \u2014 and are willing to settle for a partial understanding of the American middle class\u2019 predicament \u2014 this chart from the \u201cThe Middle-Clash Crunch\u201d will tell you 95 percent of what you need to know:\n\nThe neoliberal era has scored American households cheaper groceries and electronics. But it\u2019s also enabled extractive interests in the health-care, housing, and higher education sectors to bleed middle-income families dry.\n\nThe health-care industry may be our economy\u2019s most enervating parasite. Due to our central government\u2019s exceptional refusal to combat rent-seeking in the medical sector through price controls, the United States spends several times more than similar nations on health-care administration, pharmaceuticals, and physicians\u2019 salaries. In return, Americans enjoy the 29th best health-care system in the world (just behind the Czech Republic\u2019s), according to the Lancet.\n\nTo appreciate just how thoroughly we\u2019re being ripped off, consider our neighbors to the north. In 2018, Canada spent roughly 11 percent of its GDP on health care, which was enough to provide all of its citizens with premium-free access to the world\u2019s 14th highest performing health-care system. That same year, the United States spent roughly 18 percent of its GDP on health care \u2014 which, in our system, was not sufficient to provide any form of insurance to nearly 30 million Americans, nor to prevent more than 50 percent of our people from delaying or forgoing medical care due to affordability concerns.\n\nA common misconception about the American political economy is that U.S. workers are lightly taxed. The Europeans may have a plusher safety net, the story goes, but at least we get to keep more of our take-home pay. But this is only true if one regards health insurance as a discretionary expense, which is not how the vast majority of adults in developed countries see it. And once you stipulate that insurance premiums function effectively as taxes on labor in the United States \u2014 which is to say, as (de facto) compulsory payments deducted from Americans\u2019 paychecks to finance social insurance \u2014 then American workers\u2019 labor income is taxed at one of the highest rates in the OECD. As Matt Bruenig of the People\u2019s Policy Project has shown:\n\nIn other words, the American middle class is already taxed like Europe\u2019s. But instead of buying us universal health care and other forms of social protection, our paycheck deductions go toward sustaining redundant private insurance bureaucracies, Big Pharma\u2019s high profit margins, and American doctors\u2019 extraordinary salaries. We aren\u2019t choosing to put \u201csmall government\u201d above social welfare. We are choosing to be ripped off.\n\nAnd the costs of our government\u2019s refusal to confront the health-care lobby grow higher every year. In 2019, the average annual premium on an employer-provided family health-insurance plan is $20,756 \u2014 54 percent higher than it was just ten years ago. This form of inflation not only increases Americans\u2019 out-of-pocket health-care costs, but also depresses their wages; the more employers need to spend on their share of premiums, the less they can provide in direct compensation.\n\nA similar dynamic prevails in America\u2019s higher education system. A 2018 OECD report found that the U.S. spends more per student on higher education than any developed country save Luxembourg. A wide variety of factors contribute to America\u2019s outsize college spending. But the primary one is the same basic policy failure that\u2019s breaking our health-care system. As The Atlantic reported last year:\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is in a class of its own,\u201d says Andreas Schleicher, the director for education and skills at the OECD, and he does not mean this as a compliment. \u201cSpending per student is exorbitant, and it has virtually no relationship to the value that students could possibly get in exchange.\u201d \u2026 Ultimately, college is expensive in the U.S. for the same reason MRIs are expensive: There is no central mechanism to control price increases. \u201cUniversities extract money from students because they can,\u201d says Schleicher at the OECD. \u201cIt\u2019s the inevitable outcome of an unregulated fee structure.\u201d In places like the United Kingdom, the government limits how much universities can extract by capping tuition.\n\nFinally, restrictive zoning on the local level \u2014 and policies that favor homeowners over renters, and foster asset-price inflation on the federal one \u2014 have enabled landlords (and longtime home owners who sell their properties) to extract a rising share of middle-class workers\u2019 earnings, especially in the nation\u2019s most prosperous metro areas. As the Times notes, the average U.S. household now devotes 33 percent of its expenditures to housing, up from 27 percent in 1950.\n\n3) We let our social welfare institutions (such as they are) grow too damn outdated.\n\nAfter helping bosses drive down middle-class wages \u2014 and landlords, hospitals, insurers, and college administrators heavily garnish what remained of its take-home pay \u2014 the least policymakers could do was update America\u2019s (meager) social welfare institutions for the modern age. Alas, despite some modest efforts by Democratic administrations at the state and federal levels, our political class as a whole has failed to clear this threshold.\n\nThe New Deal bargain that briefly brought a pale facsimile of social democracy to the United States was built around several premises that no longer obtain. Chief among them: that the corporate sector would provide middle-class workers with social benefits akin to those doled out by the state in European nations, and that a \u201cfamily wage\u201d that would enable middle-class women to either stay home, or work part time, so as to provide the services necessary for social reproduction. Of course, all middle-income Americans (let alone, all Americans period) were never cut in on this deal. And its prevalence is often exaggerated in pop-culture depictions of the period, and thus, popular memory. But it remains the case that, for many millions of middle-class Americans, this social contract provided a robust degree of economic security.\n\nThe past four decades have rendered that contract null and void. One aspect of this development merits celebration \u2014 through political mobilization, women have secured greater autonomy and freedom in their economic lives, and have therefore drastically increased their participation in the workforce. But as the Times\u2019 report suggests, this jump in women\u2019s working hours wasn\u2019t driven solely by female empowerment; the necessity of compensating for male wage stagnation or decline was also ostensibly a factor:\n\nFrom 1979 to 2018, middle-income families\u2019 incomes rose 23.1 percent, adjusted for inflation, according to the study. Professional families\u2019 incomes, by contrast, rose 68.3 percent. Over the same 39 years, the average American woman experienced a 21 percent increase in annual working hours, according to [Center for Equitable Growth economist Heather] Boushey\u2019s analysis. Most of the earnings gains among families in the period Ms. Boushey studied can be traced directly to working women. They accounted for three-quarters of the rise in income among middle-class families in that time. Among professional families, women\u2019s earnings were the most important factor, but men\u2019s incomes rose, too. \u201cMany families would have seen their income drop precipitously over the past few decades if it had not been for women going to work,\u201d Ms. Boushey said.\n\nWomen\u2019s growing economic participation has made a massive contribution to our collective prosperity. But it has also made America\u2019s aberrant lack of family welfare policies \u2014 such as public daycare, child allowances, and paid family-leave benefits \u2014 even more conspicuous and burdensome for middle-class households.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. employers have gradually withdrawn from the \u201cTreaty of Detroit,\u201d lowering the benefit standards many embraced in the postwar period, either by leaning on contract laborers instead of employees, or simply downgrading their offerings. As the Times writes, \u201cPensions have been largely replaced by 401(k) plans. Comprehensive health coverage has given way to high-deductible plans.\u201d\n\nLike women\u2019s heightened labor-force participation, the decoupling of social provision from employment could have been an entirely positive development \u2014 if Uncle Sam had stepped in to pick up the slack. But it didn\u2019t. The disappearance of the defined benefit-pension plan didn\u2019t coincide with increases in Social Security benefits, but rather, with effective cuts to such benefits. And the rise in women\u2019s working hours did not coincide with the establishment of universal public childcare, but rather, soaring private childcare costs.\n\nAs a result, economic life for the American middle class has grown more volatile and insecure, with sharp drops in annual income becoming an increasingly common experience.\n\nIn sum: The \u201cmiddle-class crunch\u201d is a choice. The American Dream isn\u2019t dying of natural causes. We know what must be done to revive it.
