USA TODAY\n\nThe Chinese government won\u2019t put up with this sort of thing. And LeBron James darn well knows it.\n\nThe NBA star suggested Monday it\u2019s better to just shut up and keep your head down than risk offending the rulers of China. Even a seven-word message on Twitter from an NBA general manager can get under their skin, as James and the NBA learned last week.\n\n\u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually,\u201d James told reporters Monday. \u201cJust be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. We do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too.\u201d\n\nLeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers joined the Brooklyn Nets in playing in Shenzhen, China last week.

They deal with it and move on. By contrast, nuclear-armed China practically threatened to shut down the NBA\u2019s business there after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey temporarily posted an image on Twitter Oct. 4 that said, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIs that really all it takes to hurt the feelings of the ruling Communist Party in China?\n\nYes, experts say, that\u2019s really all it takes. And that\u2019s also why they suggest this issue won\u2019t be forgotten by China and is bound to flare up again. The bigger question now is what happens the next time China gets bothered by something else.\n\nOPINION: LeBron James undermines values he's espoused in most disgraceful moment of career\n\nBASKETBALL DIPLOMACY:What's at stake for the NBA in China?\n\n\u201cThe paradox is that the Chinese leaders, with all their power in the world and control at home, are deadly frightened that their regime might topple,\u201d said Stein Ringen, a Norwegian political scientist and author of The Perfect Dictatorship: China in the 21st Century. \u201cThese men, who seem so assured, do not sleep at peace at night. As a result, they react with brutality against any slight.\u201d\n\nWhen the next slight comes, experts say China will expect the offender to fall in line with the usual response. At a minimum, that means an apology and muting of any message that even remotely challenges the power of the authoritarian regime or its \u201csovereignty.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the NBA, Commissioner Adam Silver said last week the league was \u201cnot apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression\u201d but said he regretted that people got upset over his tweet. The NBA also shut up about Hong Kong, where protesters have been fighting for democracy and autonomy apart from mainland China and its one-party government in Beijing.\n\nEven James, who has been outspoken about domestic politics, apparently would rather side with China against Morey than risk billions of dollars in business in China with media, apparel and other deals, including an estimated $500 million in annual NBA revenue from China alone.\n\nChina\u2019s warning shot\n\nJames said Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d or not properly educated about the potential consequences of his tweet before he posted it. He said, \u201cWe all do have freedom of speech but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others, and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself.\u201d\n\nThose ramifications all but crushed James and NBA during their preseason tour there last week. State TV in China blacked out NBA games. NBA advertising in China was torn down or removed. NBA press conferences in China were canceled.\n\nOn the other side of the geopolitical divide, the league also got bombarded with criticism in the U.S. for not more strongly supporting freedom of speech against China. Yet the NBA still seemed somewhat brave compared to the many other American companies that have faced the same choice between making money in China or sticking up for American values.\n\nOne side often wins that battle, even when the whims of Beijing seem increasingly less reasonable. For example, Twitter is blocked by the government in China. Chinese citizens technically shouldn\u2019t be able to see it or use it as a result. A deleted tweet on a blocked website from some guy in Houston shouldn\u2019t really matter then, either. But it does.\n\nLikewise, clothing retailer The Gap last year apologized for selling a T-shirt of a Chinese map that didn\u2019t include the island of Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that China still claims as its territory. The Gap said it would destroy the shirts in China and said it mistakenly failed to reflect the \u201ccorrect map\u201d of China.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese leadership can pressure companies to play by Beijing\u2019s script, it will do so,\u201d said Margaret Lewis, a law professor at Seton Hall whose research focuses on law, criminal justice reform and human rights in China. \u201cIt\u2019s worked.\u201d\n\nThough the NBA has billions at stake in China, its global brand and beloved celebrity players also give it lots of leverage \u2013 much more so than, say, The Gap. James and the Los Angeles Lakers still attracted a sellout crowd in China for a preseason game last week amid the controversy.\n\n\u201cGiven the high popularity of NBA in China, perhaps over time this conflict could soften,\u201d said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor at Georgia State and author of the book Media Politics in China: Improvising Power under Authoritarianism.\n\nThe key words are \u201cthis conflict,\u201d which doesn\u2019t apply to the next one or the one after that. Repnikova notes that Morey\u2019s tweet came at a particularly sensitive time in U.S.-China relations. Besides the conflict in Hong Kong, China is engaged in a trade war with the U.S. that\u2019s led to global economic anxiety. Against that backdrop, Repnikova told USA TODAY Sports that China\u2019s reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet can be viewed as a warning shot to others \u2013 a \u201csignaling mechanism for other U.S. companies and entities to practice more caution in discussing China's politically sensitive issues publicly.\u201d\n\nIn that regard, China\u2019s reaction succeeded, for now, though experts say it\u2019s only a matter of time before a similar crisis emerges.\n\n'It\u2019s not their habit to back down\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s because this is what happens when companies from a country that values democracy and freedom of speech try to make money in another country that considers such values to be threatening to its very existence.\n\nThey try to toe the line, even if the line isn\u2019t clear. Government officials in China also recently have tried to crack down on foreign names on buildings in China, suggesting such names aren\u2019t appropriate because they hurt the nation\u2019s feelings.\n\n\u201cThis happens all of the time within China itself,\u201d said Carl Minzner, an expert on Chinese governance at Fordham and author of the book End of An Era: How China\u2019s Authoritarian Revival is Undermining its Rise. \u201cDomestic (Chinese) firms and international companies are perpetually altering their self-depictions to correspond with tacit or direct political signals. This is just part of being in an authoritarian one-Party state which doesn't have a free press, has been pushing a strongly nationalist line among the public for decades, and in which lower-level bureaucrats are always worried about making a misstep that might cause them to fall out of favor with their superiors. \u201c\n\nMinzner said this has gotten worse in China, devolving into a more closed, nativist autocracy under Chinese President Xi Jinping. This, in turn, suggests that American companies there will be expected to continue to bend in even more away from the direction of democracy. But their choice isn\u2019t necessarily binary between following orders from Beijing or not doing business in China at all, Lewis said.\n\n\u201cThis is the lightning rod right now,\u201d Lewis told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThis hits any American or foreign company involved with China. There needs to be deep think about a company\u2019s values: what they stand for and what compromises they are willing to make in order to have market access.\u201d\n\nSome kind of trade-off still will be required, now and over the longer road ahead. The question is how big it will be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not their habit to back down,\u201d Ringen said.\n\nFollow reporter Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer.
