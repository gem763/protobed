The Wrap reported yesterday that Adult Swim has set a premiere date for the long-in-the-works third season of the series, which wrapped up its last season way back in 2015. The show will be making changes this season in the wake of star Charlie Murphy\u2019s death in 2017, a loss cast member Corey Holcomb spoke about later that year. \u201cThey decided to bring Black Jesus back, so we\u2019re getting ready to start filming again in September and that should be fun. It\u2019s gonna be weird without Charlie Murphy on set,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get this thing going without him, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re still gonna make the show good, but it will be different not seeing him on set.\u201d\n\nCheck out the trailer for the new season above, then catch the rest when it makes its way to Adult Swim Friday, September 20, at midnight.", "description": "After four years, Aaron McGruder and Mike Clattenberg\u2019s Adult Swim series \u2018Black Jesus\u2019 will return for a third season later this month.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/11-black-jesus.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
