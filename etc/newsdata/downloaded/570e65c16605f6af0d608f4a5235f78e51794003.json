His question to reporters, many of them Saudi, drew applause.\n\nThe state-run company\u2019s ability to quickly recover from an attack of this magnitude on its most important processing facility highlights not only its resilience, but its importance as the kingdom\u2019s crown jewel.\n\nThe attack early Saturday struck a Saudi oil field and the world\u2019s largest crude oil processing plant in the kingdom\u2019s eastern region, taking out 5.7 million barrels of crude oil production per day for the kingdom, or about 5% of the world\u2019s daily production.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz said Aramco will honor its commitments to its customers this month by drawing from its reserves of crude oil and offering additional crude production from other oil fields.\n\nHe said production capacity would reach up to 11 million barrels a day by the end of September and 12 million barrels in November.\n\nHe said production at the Abqaiq processing facility is currently at 2 million barrels per day.\n\nHis briefing to reporters was highly anticipated around the world, with oil prices spiking more than 14% on Monday on the first day of trading after the attacks on Saudi Arabia. It was the biggest single-day jump in years due to the damaging attack.\n\nFollowing reports of how quickly the kingdom could restore production, oil prices fell on Tuesday. Brent, the international benchmark, was down 6% to $64.89 a barrel. U.S. oil was down 5.4% to $59.50.\n\nThe attack also took out 2 billion cubic feet of daily gas production. Aramco, the Saudi oil company targeted, said no workers were wounded in the attack.\n\nIranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia are at war with, claimed responsibility, saying drones were launched in the attack. The war in Yemen, the Arab region\u2019s poorest country, has sparked the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis and killed tens of thousands of people, with many of those deaths blamed on Saudi coalition warplanes.\n\nSaudi Arabia, however, has claimed the attack did not come from Yemen and said initial investigations show Iranian weapons were used. The kingdom, though, has not yet said where the attack was launched from or what kind of weapons were involved.\n\nThe U.S has made similar allegations, going so far as to say the attack may have been launched from Iran itself or nearby Iraq, where Iran has powerful proxy militias on the ground.\n\nIran has denied the charges.\n\nTrump declared Monday it \u201clooks\u201d like Iran was behind the explosive attack on the Saudi oil facilities. But he stressed that military retaliation was not yet on the table in response to the strike against a key U.S. Mideast ally.\n\nTrump, alternating between aggressive and nonviolent reactions, said the U.S. could respond \u201cwith an attack many, many times larger\u201d but also \u201cI\u2019m not looking at options right now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, he had said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded.\u201d He also said the impact of oil production shortages would not be significant on the U.S., which is a net energy exporter.\n\nThe American Automobile Association, known as AAA, said Americans can expect local pump prices to start to increase this week by as much 25 cents per gallon throughout September, but that how long the higher price lasts for depended on how quickly Saudi Arabia could restore production.\n\nThe attack was the among the most serious escalations in tensions in the Persian Gulf in recent months. The crisis stems from President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. He also re-imposed and escalated sanctions on Iran that sent the country\u2019s economy into freefall, including targeting its oil exports.\n\nIran\u2019s supreme leader said Tuesday \u201cthere will be no talks with the U.S. at any level\u201d. His remarks appear to end all speculation about a possible U.S.-Iran meeting between the two countries\u2019 presidents at the U.N. later this month.\n\nIranian state TV quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who\u2019s been personally sanctioned by the Trump administration, as saying the U.S. wants to prove its \u201cmaximum pressure policy\u201d against Iran is successful. \u201cIn return, we have to prove that the policy is not worth a penny for the Iranian nation,\u201d Khamenei said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why all Iranian officials, from the president and the foreign minister to all others have announced that we do not negotiate (with the U.S.) either bilaterally or multilaterally,\u201d he said.\n\nThere had been reports about a possible meeting between Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, during the upcoming U.N. General Assembly next week in New York.\n\nOne U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the U.S. was now considering dispatching additional military resources to the Gulf but that no decisions had been made. In recent months, the U.S. has boosted its military presence with an additional aircraft carrier in the area, as well as fighter jets, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and air defenses.\n\nThe Saudis invited the U.N. and other international experts to help investigate, suggesting there was no rush to retaliate and that the kingdom is looking for an internationally backed response to the attack.\n\nSaudi Arabia also called on the international community \u201cto shoulder its responsibility in condemning the perpetrators\u201d and \u201cclearly confronting\u201d those behind the attack.\n\nFor his part, Khamenei on Tuesday reiterated Iran\u2019s stance that if the U.S. returns to the nuclear deal, Tehran would consider negotiations.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, no talks will happen \u2026 with the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither in New York nor anywhere\u201d else.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran and Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's energy minister said Tuesday that more than half of the country's daily crude oil production that was knocked out by an attack had been recovered and that production capacity at its targeted plants would be fully restored by the end of the month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aya Batrawy", "Jon Gambrell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/saudi_persian_gulf_tensions_39823_c0-241-5760-3599_s1770x1032.jpg?5744a6e428d626295d3fe14d6d300f488e16a9a8", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
