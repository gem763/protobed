Trump has urged American companies to return home.\n\nBritain, on the other hand, is still mired in its Brexit crisis, which started when the nation voted to leave the European Union amid the rise of nationalistic sentiment and the immigration crisis in Europe.\n\nBut Jia said: \"I don't think (decoupling is) reasonable and ... going to serve our interest.\"\n\nIn fact, China has been successful partly because it hasn't been \"dogmatic\" in following the models of others, he said. He called on countries to follow their own paths, taking into account individual domestic conditions.\n\n\"People in Washington would say: this is China trying to set up another alternative model of development for developing countries. This is wrong. China is saying that every country should form their path ... in consideration of their own national situation,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of people in Washington are ... trying to demonize China and develop policies on that basis. I think the world should get over that,\" Jia told the conference.", "description": "Experts say the world may face a \"multi-dimensional cold war\" as nations are \"pressured to take sides\" between the U.S. and China.", "authors": ["Weizhen Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105912849-1557862472926trumpxi.jpg?v=1569378814", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
