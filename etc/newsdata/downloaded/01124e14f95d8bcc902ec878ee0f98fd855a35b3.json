But by wiggling around the egg, embryos can find the \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d which means they are able to shield themselves against extreme thermal conditions and produce a balanced sex ratio, according to the new study published in Current Biology journal Ye et al/Current Biology 2/20 Elephant poaching rates drop in Africa African elephant poaching rates have dropped by 60 per cent in six years, an international study has found. It is thought the decline could be associated with the ivory trade ban introduced in China in 2017.

Our idea is that we are going to get breath, and we are going to sniff it. Smelling breath gives access to the body\u2019s biological process. We are trying to reduce the number of people being prescribed medication \u2013 if you can reduce this by 20 per cent, that is a massive saving.\u201d\n\nPreliminary trial results from the BreathSpec project, which was led by Imspex, suggest it has 80 per cent accuracy, Prof Covington told the British Science Festival, which is being held in Coventry and Warwickshire.\n\nOver 18 months, the scientists recruited 1,112 participants from seven hospitals and two GP surgeries \u2013 two hospitals and two GP surgeries in Liverpool, two hospitals in Leicester and hospitals in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Blackpool.\n\nThey found that of these, 406 had an upper respiratory infection, of which 376 were non-bacterial and 30 were bacterial.\n\nThere were 520 people with lower respiratory infection, 272 of which were non-bacterial and 248 were bacterial. Some 186 had neither.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This could be a cold or a flu or one of the other ones \u2013 that is pretty good for a general screening situation.\n\n\u201cBut to an extent, you could also say that we could accurately state that eight out of 10 patients had the flu or common cold.\u201d\n\nPress Association", "description": "The prescribing of antibiotics could be drastically reduced by a device that detects bacteria in human breath, scientists have said.
