Thunder and lightning shook the skies as thick and grey clouds seemed to give back to Sicily all the water it had not received that entire summer.\n\nA few metres from her small apartment in the Oratory of Saint Lawrence in Palermo, where her mother was a housekeeper, one of the most notorious art thefts in history was taking place, as a Caravaggio that had hung for more than three centuries above the altar was cut out of its frame.\n\nFifty years have passed since 17 October 1969, but Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio\u2019s Nativity with St Francis and St Lawrence remains one of the world\u2019s most sought-after works of stolen art.\n\nLampone was 15 at the time and living with her mother, Maria Gelfo, and her aunt in the church. \u201cMy mother and aunt were the first to arrive on the scene,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were wailing and screaming.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Antonella Lampone and her mother, Maria, in 1969\n\n\u201cI fell out of my bed and ran to the altar of the church where the painting was hanging and that now was missing. We spent the next days mourning over that loss. They hadn\u2019t stolen a painting; they had kidnapped a member of my family.\u201d\n\nBack then in Palermo, only one organisation had the power to steal such a treasure: the Sicilian mafia.\n\nIn a video interview filmed in 2001 but locked in a drawer and revealed last month exclusively to the Guardian, the parish priest of the oratory, Rocco Benedetto, said the painting was in the home of a powerful mafia boss who had sliced off a piece of the canvas in order to convince the Catholic church to come to the negotiating table for its return, contacting him twice by letter.\n\nLampone has confirmed Benedetto\u2019s statements. \u201cI recall that the parish priest told my mother that he had been contacted by the thieves to make a deal,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Benedetto, the painting was in the home of the mafia boss Gaetano Badalamenti, who at the time was one of the most powerful mobsters in Sicily, running a $1.65bn (\u00a31.3bn) heroin trafficking network to the US.\n\nBenedetto informed the police of the letters and the piece of canvas, but the files of his statements seem to have vanished.\n\nA month ago, Sicilian investigators questioned Lampone. \u201cI asked the police whether my mother\u2019s formal statements were still in the police archives. She had been questioned dozens of times, but I was told that her files had disappeared,\u201d she said.\n\nInvestigators are racing against time. Many suspects and witnesses of the crime are deceased, including Badalamenti, who died in 2004, and Benedetto, who died in 2013. Lampone\u2019s mother passed away two years after the theft.\n\nPlay Video 1:19 Monsignor Rocco Bendetto testifies about Caravaggio's Nativity - video\n\nThe 'kidnapped' Caravaggio: how the mafia took a razor blade to a masterpiece Read more\n\nIn the weeks preceding it, Lampone recalls her mother requesting greater security for a window in the church after several suspicious individuals had asked her to let them in so they could admire the painting.\n\n\u201cMy mother was alerted, and she asked the Vatican Curia to secure a window in the oratory that was accessible from the street where the Caravaggio was displayed. But the Curia said that there was no need follow through,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was precisely from that window that the thieves entered the church on a rainy night 50 years ago.\n\nHopes of solving the mystery behind the Nativity, the one and only painting signed by Caravaggio, were reignited in June last year after Italian investigators announced Gaetano Grado, a mafia informant, said Badalamenti had been put in touch with an art dealer in Switzerland.\n\nProsecutors are now looking to Switzerland, where new witnesses might hold the ultimate secret of one of the greatest mysteries in art history. The foremost question is whether the painting is in a good condition, even if the evidence strongly suggests otherwise.\n\nIn 1989, another mafia informant named Francesco \u201cMozzarella\u201d Marino Mannoia revealed to the magistrate Giovanni Falcone that he had stolen the Caravaggio, rolling up the canvas to smuggle it out of the church. Lampone recalls a rug was also stolen that night, which was likely used by the thieves to roll up the canvas and protect it from the rain.\n\n\u201cThat decision proved fatal,\u201d said Maurizio Ortolan, a police officer who was present during Mannoia\u2019s interrogation, since paint, hardened over centuries, easily cracks.\n\n\u201cMannoia said that when they opened the canvas, the paint had partially disintegrated.\u201d\n\nMichele Cuppone, an expert on the missing Caravaggio, said: \u201cRolling up from the inside a canvas from the 1600s is one of the worst mistakes one can make.\n\n\u201cThere have been other cases of stolen paintings that had been rolled up. When rediscovered, they were marred with deep horizontal cracks the entire length of the canvas.\u201d", "description": "Investigators are racing against time to find one of world\u2019s most sought-after stolen artworks", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f996ab0b977bf3e6f610c2d551e068b41d96c8b8/808_1071_2664_1599/master/2664.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c0622645edbe634ea0448d782890523", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
