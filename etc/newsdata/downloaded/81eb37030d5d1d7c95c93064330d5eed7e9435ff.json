Tang Wu, manager of the Forever Health Pharmacy on East Broadway, told The New York Times: \"They have nowhere to live and you beat them to death. How terrible.\"\n\nThe crimes come at a time when Chinatown is experiencing a rising number of homeless people on its streets along with an increase in real estate prices.\n\nEric Lee, manager of Dim Sum Go Go, said the number of homeless in Kimlau Square has more than doubled, from about four to more than 10, he told the Post.\n\n\"They're sleeping here \u2014 on mattresses, benches. They're hanging out here, drinking, smoking. Overnight. It's not good. It affects our business. They drink a lot, they get rowdy and loud,\" he said.\n\nKarlin Chan, a member of the local community board, told the Post that the homeless relieving themselves in city parks also has been a major concern.\n\nAccording to a report published by the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, there were 61,674 homeless people in New York City in August, with more than 3,500 of them camping out on city streets and other public places.", "description": "The deadly bludgeoning of four sleeping homeless men in Manhattan's Chinatown has startled the city.
