A veteran Romanian government minister, she already faces scrutiny over a 2017 corruption case, in which she was accused of aiding the leader of her Social Democratic Party in an illicit real estate deal involving an island in the Danube River.\n\nSome MEPs argued that Plumb's financial situation raises potential financial conflicts of interest.\n\nShe has previously denied any wrongdoing in that case and did not respond to a request for comment from POLITICO on the new financial questions.\n\nClosed-door meeting\n\nAhead of their confirmation hearings, 10 members of von der Leyen's proposed team were asked by the committee to provide further information on whether their assets could lead to conflicts of interest in the performance of their duties. Committee members are set to determine at a closed-doors meeting Wednesday if the extra information \u2014 in the form of letters seen by POLITICO \u2014 passes muster.\n\nIf the committee deems it insufficient, they may decide to suspend that commissioner-designate's confirmation hearing. The hearings are scheduled to take place between September 30 and October 8, with the new Commission expected to take office on November 1.\n\nUnder the Parliament's rules, if the committee identifies a conflict of interest, it can draw up recommendations aimed at resolving the conflict \u2014 such as directing the nominee to renounce the financial interests in question or recommending changes to the candidate's portfolio. \"In more serious cases,\" the committee can conclude \"on the inability of Commissioner-designate to exercise his/her function.\"\n\n\"If the things that circulate come true, then we have a serious problem\" \u2014 Daniel Caspary, MEP, European People's Party\n\nIn a letter addressed to Lucy Nethsingha, the chair, Plumb argued that neither loan had to be declared under the Code of Conduct for commissioners. In the letter, she confirmed that she included an \u20ac800,000 loan received in 2007 \u2014 to be paid back by 2030 \u2014 in the declaration of assets she submitted to the Romanian parliament when she was an MP.\n\nShe said she did not include it in the EU financial declaration because loans for the purchase of real estate for private purposes do not \u201cnormally\" have to be declared under the Commission's code. In the case of a donation of 800,000 Romanian lei (almost \u20ac170,000) she made to her Social Democratic Party ahead of the European election this year, she said it did not generate any conflicts of interest or constitute an investment or placement on the market.\n\nPlumb says she received the money for the donation as a loan from an individual she does not name in the submission to the Commission, although she said the lender had been registered with the Romanian parliament. According to that parliament's register of financial interests, the loan is due to be paid back over two years.\n\nAccording to the Code of Conduct, commissioners-designate are obliged to declare any financial interests, including assets and liabilities, \"which could be considered to be capable of giving rise to a conflict of interest. Bank accounts, specific goods or loans for the purchase of real estate for private purposes do normally not have to be declared. Investments of a value of more than EUR 10 000 have to be declared in all cases.\"\n\nSome MEPs argued that Plumb's financial situation raises potential financial conflicts of interest. Daniel Freund, a German MEP and former head of EU advocacy at NGO Transparency International, said he regards Plumb's letter to the committee as unsatisfactory.\n\nNine others from von der Leyen's proposed team were asked by the committee for more information.\n\n\u201cShe did not answer the questions of the Parliament, and she did not take away any of the concerns,\" said Freund, who serves as the Greens/EFA group's coordinator in the Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is responsible for ethics rules.\n\n\u201cShe merely says that different rules in Romania and in the European Commission lead to differences in the declaration,\" he said, adding that the submission does not explain her \"financial situation, donations to her party, loans where nobody knows how she manages to pay them back.\"\n\nReferring to the earlier corruption allegations, Daniel Caspary, a prominent German MEP from the center-right European People's Party, said: \"If the things that circulate come true, then we have a serious problem.\"\n\nFinancial interests\n\nNine others from von der Leyen's proposed team were asked by the committee for more information. The nominee for foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in his letter to the committee dated September 23 that he had been asked to \u201cconsider the possibility of disposing of my shares in Bayer, Iberdrola and BBVA in order to prevent any conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cI have not considered this possibility so far, since these shares represent a small amount of my financial assets. More importantly, the sectors of activity of these companies (renewable energies, pharmaceutical and banking) are not related with the responsibilities for which I have been designated.\u201d\n\n\"We need an independent ethics body that will investigate any possible violations of ethical conduct and sanction offenders\u201d \u2014 Daniel Freund, MEP, Greens/EFA group's coordinator\n\nHealth nominee Stella Kyriakides wrote in her letter dated September 20 that \u201cas of last Friday,\u201d she had sold her \"bonds\" in the Starbucks Corporation. She also resigned \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d from the breast cancer patients group Europa Donna Cyprus and the Miracle Babies association, which helps infants born prematurely.\n\nPortugal's Elisa Ferreira, the proposed nominee for cohesion and reforms, confirmed in her letter that she had decided to \u201csell the shares\u201d she had in the Portugal-based company Sonae. The shares' value amounted to \u20ac13,789 on September 19.\n\nFrance's Sylvie Goulard, the commissioner-designate for the single market, explained in her letter dated September 23 why her declaration of interests submitted as a member of the European Parliament is different to the one she submitted as a commissioner-designate.\n\n\u201cI scrupulously declared to the European Parliament some activities before taking them up, which turned out to be non-existent,\u201d Goulard wrote.\n\nDidier Reynders, Belgium\u2019s foreign minister and proposed justice commissioner, was asked to clarify \u201cthe field of activities\u201d of his SICAV, a collective investment fund in Belgium. \u201cThe investor has no influence on the investment choices made by the SICAV\u2019s managers,\u201d Reynders wrote in his letter, which came with a 44-page annex.\n\nOther commissioners-designate who sent additional information on their finances include the Czech Republic's V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, Poland's Janusz Wojciechowski, and Lithuania's Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius.\n\nDespite the committee's work in scrutinizing the nominees' financial declarations, Freund said that ultimately, the committee is likely to wave through any potential conflicts of interests because it \"neither has the time nor the resources to properly investigate conflicts of interests.\u201d The committee can only examine financial declarations. It cannot carry out investigations.\n\n\u201cThe current procedure is not enough to scrutinize the future Commission thoroughly,\u201d Freund added. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need an independent ethics body that will investigate any possible violations of ethical conduct and sanction offenders.\u201d\n\nToussaint echoed Freund\u2019s remarks, saying the committee\u2019s examination is \u201conly an initial filter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work we do is incomplete, and we don\u2019t even interfere into any political issue,\" Toussaint said.\n\nCarmen Paun contributed reporting.", "description": "MEPs are concerned the loans could lead to potential conflicts of interest.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Hans Von Der Burchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55206876-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
