Picture: Michael Klein\n\nThe 32-year-old played 101 games for the Blues across six seasons but it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing, enduring a number of injuries and at times struggled for form.\n\nHe tore up a lucrative games-based clause in his contract in 2017 that would trigger an extension as speculation about his future intensified when he was dropped mid-season and instead won new deals on merit.\n\nIt means if he doesn\u2019t find a new home for next season, while he\u2019d initially be disappointed, Thomas is content with moving on to the next phase of his life.\n\n\u201cTo be completely honest I sort of feel like I\u2019ve been on borrowed time for the last couple of years,\u201d Thomas said on SEN.\n\nMORE NEWS:\n\n\u2018Lids\u2019 a chance for playing role at Hawks\n\nPower issue bizarre guidelines to media\n\nPodcast: Champion Data\u2019s trade winners\n\n\u201cA few years ago my form wasn\u2019t great, my body wasn\u2019t great either and there was a realistic opportunity I could have been delisted. So the club was good enough to put some faith in me and I feel like the last couple of seasons I repaid that one, with what I was able to do on the field and two, what I was able to do off the field in developing some of the younger kids.\n\n\u201cFrom a personal point of view it\u2019s very disappointing but at the same time I fully understand (not being offered a contract).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to craft out a career that lasted 14 years, so in that sense now reflecting, I\u2019m happy with where it all sits but I thought my footy may have been good enough to keep me going.\u201d", "description": "Dale Thomas hasnt given up hope of extending his AFL career into next year after receiving some interest but reveals the surprising reason why hed be happy to retire from playing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6c8d0b2440ca03a04eaa33b03976cc79", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
