Typically, he weighs 135 pounds.\n\nThat may seem surprising given that chess is a sedentary game, but a mental workout can burn calories too.\n\nMany people associate \"burning calories\" with exercising, but calories are simply a unit of energy that you can get from eating. Your body needs energy to perform all of your daily activities, including using your brain.\n\nThe brain relies heavily on glucose, a form of sugar, to complete functions such as thinking, memory and learning, according to the Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute.
