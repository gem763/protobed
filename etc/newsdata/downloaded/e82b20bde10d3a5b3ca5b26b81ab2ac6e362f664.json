(\u201cBriaCell\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V:BCT) (OTCQB:BCTXF), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in targeted immunotherapy for advanced breast cancer, announces that it has filed on SEDAR an amendment to its management information circular dated September 23, 2019 (the \"Circular\") to amend the maximum share consolidation ratio from 100:1 to 300:1 (the \"Amendment\"). BriaCell\u2019s Board of Directors retains the discretion to fix the ratio and determine the timing for implementation of the share consolidation. As indicated in the Circular, BriaCell is considering applying for listing on a recognized US stock exchange. The conditions to any such listing would include the common shares trading at a minimum prescribed price and would, based on current trading values, require a significant share consolidation. There is no assurance that the Company will apply for or successfully obtain a US listing.\n\n\n\nAbout BriaCell\n\nBriaCell is an immuno-oncology focused biotechnology company developing targeted and safe approaches for the management of cancer.\n\nBriaCell is conducting a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of Bria-IMT\u2122, BriaCell\u2019s lead candidate, in a Combination Study with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as the Incyte drugs INCMGA00012 (an anti-PD-1 antibody similar to pembrolizumab [KEYTRUDA\u00ae; manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK)]) and epacadostat, an orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). The combination study is listed in ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03328026.\n\nBriaCell currently has a non-exclusive clinical trial collaboration with Incyte Corporation to evaluate the effects of combinations of novel clinical candidates. Under the agreement, Incyte and BriaCell will be evaluating novel combinations of compounds from Incyte\u2019s development portfolio with BriaCell\u2019s drug candidates in advanced breast cancer patients.\n\nBriaCell is also developing Bria-OTS\u2122, an off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapy, for advanced breast cancer. Bria-OTS\u2122 immunotherapy treatments are personalized to match the patient without the need for personalized manufacturing. Bria-OTS\u2122, which is expected to cover over 99 percent of the patient population, is designed to produce a potent and selective immune response against the cancer of each patient while eliminating the time, expense and complex manufacturing logistics associated with other personalized immunotherapies.\n\nFor additional information on BriaCell, please visit: https://briacell.com/.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\n\nExcept for the statements of historical fact, this news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of the applicable Canadian securities legislation which involves known and unknown risks relevant to the Company in particular and to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in general, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual events to differ materially from current expectation.
