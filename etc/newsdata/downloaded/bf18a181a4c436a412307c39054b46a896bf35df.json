Will Hurd (R-TX), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that during the committee\u2019s depositions of State Department officials, there were no reports of Ukrainian officials believing there was a quid pro quo in regards to military aide.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nBRENNAN: Do you think that there was, if not a quid pro quo, an understanding or a perception of one between the White House and Ukraine?\n\nHURD: That- that\u2019s a good question and to me that\u2019s the heart of this- this- this matter. And what was the- you know, if there was a quid pro quo, what was it for? Was it for investigation of the previous election? Or was it to get dirt on- in- it for- for 2020? And what we haven\u2019t heard yet- we haven\u2019t heard from any Ukrainian official that felt like there was this arrangement. We haven\u2019t even had an- a Ukrainian official tell a State Department official that their- that they felt like their arms were being twisted. I would have thought based on some of the State Department officials that we\u2019ve met- that we\u2019ve interviewed so far, that you would even get an inkling of that was happening. When I was in the CIA, I participated in, you know, diplomacy as well. And this is very often that a- the country you\u2019re posted to, in this case let\u2019s say Ukraine, if they hear something, they\u2019re going to go to their contacts at the embassy and say, \u201chey what does this actually mean?\u201d And we haven\u2019t gotten any whiff of that when it comes to this- to this issue. I also want to know who did Rudy Giuliani actually talk to.", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Rep.
