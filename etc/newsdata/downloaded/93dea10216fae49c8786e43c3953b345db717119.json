I've never been so tired,\" Leclerc told Sky after the win.\n\n\"I made a few mistakes but in the end I finished first so I'm very happy with this. I need to be careful with the mistakes but obviously none of them made me lose position today.\"\n\nLeclerc stands on the podium in front of a sea of Ferrari fans.\n\n'Not our day'\n\nChampionship leader Hamilton kept in close pursuit of Leclerc for most of the race, but when he left the track with 11 laps to go, it was down to his teammate Bottas to try and spoil the home fans' party.\n\nThe Finn narrowed the gap between his Mercedes and Leclerc's Ferrari to just half a second, but a braking error in the closing stages effectively settled the result.\n\nHamilton still holds a comfortable lead at the top of the championship, 63 points clear of Bottas.\n\n\"Congratulations to Ferrari and Charles, he did a great job,\" Hamilton told Sky after the race. \"There was a lot of pressure from both Valtteri and I. I did the best I could.\n\n\"Obviously following so closely for such a long time, the tires eventually just went off a cliff. But nonetheless they were just quicker today, much quicker in a straight line and so even if we did get close we couldn't pass.\n\n\"Not our day but still strong points for the team. We pull away from Ferrari in the constructors' championship and that's what really matters.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED 22-year-old Formula 2 driver killed in crash Replay More Videos ...
