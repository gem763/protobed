As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the 'white crow' will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.\" StudioCanal 15/41 Border \"Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent \u2013 a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.\" TriArt Film 16/41 Fighting with My Family \"Certain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won\u2019t let you go.

Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?\" James Field 17/41 Us \"Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele\u2019s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.\" AP 18/41 Avengers: Endgame \"The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.\" AP 19/41 Eighth Grade \"It\u2019s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade \u2013 the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham \u2013 breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we\u2019ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that\u2019s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.\" A24 20/41 Vox Lux \"Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet\u2019s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman\u2019s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking \u201cfloozy\u201d whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.\" Neon 21/41 High Life Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a \u201cclass-one suicide ride\u201d. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time. A24 22/41 Amazing Grace Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It\u2019s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the \u201cfirst lady of soul\u201d, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation. Neon 23/41 Aladdin Disney\u2019s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 24/41 Booksmart \u201cOlivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clich\u00e9s.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Annapurna Pictures 25/41 Late Night \u201cLate Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It\u2019s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writer/producer/star Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it. The film has a glorious performance from Emma Thompson and a very sly one from Kaling. Thompson is at her most imperious as Katherine Newbury, a legendary entertainer, the only female in a male-dominated field, but one whose career is beginning to slide.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Amazon Studios 26/41 Gloria Bell \u201cGloria Bell is somewhat exhausting \u2013 both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove \u2013 but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.\u201d Geoffrey Macnab Curzon 27/41 Toy Story 4 \"The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who\u2019ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments.

It\u2019s also bound to be one of this year\u2019s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.\" A24 31/41 The Lion King \"The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it\u2019s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.\" AP 32/41 Varda by Agn\u00e8s \"For a film that\u2019s almost entirely narrated by Agn\u00e8s Varda's own voice, it doesn\u2019t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.\" 33/41 Animals \"Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity.

Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that\u2019s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.\" AP 37/41 For Sama For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It\u2019s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors. 38/41 Ad Astra The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt\u2019s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt\u2019s performance and Gray\u2019s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 39/41 The Farewell Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it\u2019s one of the best films of the year. 40/41 Judy This is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s Judy. It doesn\u2019t belong to Rupert Goold, its director.

Path\u00e9 41/41 Ready or Not As absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn\u2019t mess around with its social commentary.
