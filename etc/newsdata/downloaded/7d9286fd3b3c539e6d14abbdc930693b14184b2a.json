Mitchell Starc or Lasith Malinga? Rashid Khan or Shakib Al Hasan?\n\nThese are just a few of the questions facing the eight teams competing in The Hundred competition ahead of Sunday\u2019s draft.\n\nEach city-based side will select 12 players \u2013 and a maximum of three overseas stars \u2013 to fill their 15-man squads, with one England Test player and two \u2018Local Icons\u2019 already assigned to teams.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe Hundred: Metro.co.uk\u2019s dream XI\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Warner (overseas, Australia) \u2013 \u00a3125,000\n\nDavid Warner is one of the most destructive batsmen in the world (Picture: Getty)\n\nEndured a shocking Ashes series but remains a world-class white-ball batsman, as he showed in last summer\u2019s World Cup, when he scored over 600 runs and three centuries.\n\nAlso a brilliant fielder, which narrowly makes him a better option than West Indies great Chris Gayle, who is also priced in the top bracket of \u00a3125,000.\n\nSam Billings (domestic, Kent) \u2013 \u00a350,000\n\nSam Billings is expected to be snapped up at the draft (Picture: Getty)\n\nOne of England\u2019s most exciting one-day cricketers and a superb wicketkeeper. Missed much of the 2019 season with a shoulder injury but hit three successive hundreds upon his return to county cricket.\n\nCan bat anywhere in the top six although a role at the top of the order may suit in this shortened format.\n\nTom Abell (domestic, Somerset) \u2013 no reserve price\n\nTom Abell produced a number of superb innings for Somerset last summer (Picture: Getty)\n\nEnjoyed an impressive T20 Blast campaign for Somerset, scoring over 350 runs at an average of 44.75. A strike-rate of almost 180 also bodes well for The Hundred.\n\nCould conceivably join his Somerset team-mate Tom Banton at Cardiff-based Welsh Fire.\n\nAndre Russell (overseas, West Indies) \u2013 \u00a3100,000\n\nWest Indies all-rounder Andre Russell is a white-ball superstar (Picture: Getty)\n\nA genuine superstar, capable of winning matches with bat and ball. A finer fielder will also be hard to find.\n\nWill not come cheap, having entered the draft with a base price of \u00a3100,000, but is worth every penny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex Blake (domestic, Kent) \u2013 no reserve price\n\nKent star Alex Blake could be a bargain (Picture: Getty)\n\nOne of the most dangerous players in county cricket, who generally produces two or three match-winning innings a season for Kent in T20 cricket \u2013 that will appeal to The Hundred coaches.\n\nCould also be a steal with no reserve price.\n\nLewis Gregory (domestic, Somerset) \u2013 no reserve price\n\nLewis Gregory will make his England debut this winter (Picture: Getty)\n\nWill make his international debut this winter after earning a place in England\u2019s T20 squad for the tour to New Zealand.\n\nInjuries limited him to just four appearances in last season\u2019s T20 Blast but he is a consistent contributor for Somerset in all formats and will be fit and firing by the time The Hundred comes around.\n\nSamit Patel (domestic, Nottinghamshire) \u2013 no reserve price\n\nSamit Patel looks set to secure a contract (Picture: Getty)\n\nWas a contender to be named one of the \u2018Local Icons\u2019 for Nottingham-based Trent Rockets but just missed out to England batsman Alex Hales and white-ball specialist Harry Gurney.\n\nContinues to shine for Notts in all formats and helped the county reach T20 Blast Finals day last month before their semi-final defeat to defending champions Worcestershire. A talented batsman and a shrewd spinner.\n\nRavi Bopara (domestic, Sussex) \u2013 no reserve price\n\nRavi Bopara guided Essex to the T20 Blast title last summer (Picture: Getty)\n\nWants to focus more on T20 cricket after leaving Essex to join Sussex, so will naturally be desperate to secure a gig in The Hundred.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan contribute with bat and ball, as he showed on Finals Day when he took two wickets and scored an unbeaten 36 to guide Essex to the title.\n\nSimon Harmer (domestic, Essex) \u2013 no reserve price\n\nEssex\u2019s Simon Harmer claimed sensational figures on Finals Day (Picture: Getty)\n\nAlso played a starring role in Essex\u2019 T20 Blast triumph, claiming the best figures of any bowler in the history of Finals Day before seeing the Eagles home with a flurry of boundaries.\n\nA former South Africa international, the 30-year-old is regarded as the best spinner in England and would bring valuable leadership skills to a new format of cricket.\n\nLiam Plunkett (domestic, Yorkshire) \u2013 \u00a350,000\n\nLiam Plunkett helped England win the World Cup last summer (Picture: Getty)\n\nWill surely attract much interest at the draft as a key member of England\u2019s World Cup-winning squad. His range of skills will be key as teams attempt to limit the inevitable carnage.\n\nAt \u00a350,000, would be a cheaper and more sensible alternative to the likes of Dale Steyn (\u00a375,000) and Chris Morris (\u00a360,000).\n\nRashid Khan (overseas, Afghanistan) \u2013 \u00a3100,000\n\nRashid Khan boasts an incredible T20 record (Picture: Getty)\n\nTwenty20 franchise leagues have shown the value of world-class bowlers, so the Afghanistan superstar will surely be the first pick for a number of coaches at the draft.\n\nHis T20 record \u2013 269 wickets at an average of 16.75 and an economy rate of 6.24 \u2013 is brilliant and gives him the edge over Sunil Narine and Shakib Al Hasan.", "description": "Chris Gayle or David Warner?
