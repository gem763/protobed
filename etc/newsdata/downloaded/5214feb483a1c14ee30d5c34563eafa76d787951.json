Months or year later, how are they doing? If they\u2019ve shipped to backers, are they still supporting the gadget? If they haven\u2019t shipped, why haven\u2019t they met their shipping deadline? We hope this column will give us all a place to understand.\n\nWhat\u2019s today\u2019s gadget, and what does it do?\n\nThe Podo camera launched on Kickstarter in September 2016 with the goal of shipping by December of that same year. It reached its $50,000 goal in days and exceeded it to reach $761,130. The idea was that the Bluetooth-connected camera could be stuck anywhere and then controlled through a user\u2019s phone. Its companion app allows users to take photos, record video, or record audio. It also provides a live preview of what the camera\u2019s seeing, so users could line up their shot.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s first Kickstarter project \u2014 its first project, which was essentially the first generation of this camera, shipped.\n\nWhat happened after funding? Did it ship?\n\nSome units have shipped. President and co-founder of Podo Labs, Eddie Lee, tells me they still have between 6,000 to 8,000 units left to send out, so it\u2019s now been two years since that original ship date. Lee said the company had to ship 25,000 units and that the remaining devices are being produced now. The company ran into multiple issues, he says, including a transistor shortage and holdups in the device\u2019s supply chain.\n\nBackers seem to be complaining not that they haven\u2019t received their camera, but that their accessories never showed up. The company was updating its Kickstarter page regularly with updates until November of last year. Now, Lee says, it\u2019s emotionally taxing to update the page and that he wishes he had better news.\n\n\u201cI have to apologize to the backers. In the very beginning it was easy to be very involved and handle all responses right away and have all this energy and optimism, and over time, it\u2019s like, \u201cthree-month delay.\u201d I\u2019m not making the products myself. I\u2019m not over there in the factory. Sometimes I wish I could do more but I can\u2019t. It wears on you. \u201cThree-month delay, six-month delay, nine-month delay,\u201d and then I\u2019m slower on the responses. On the other hand, I understand the backers are frustrated because they\u2019re left more out of the loop. It comes sometimes out of your frustration to want to do more and give better news but sometimes you just can\u2019t handle it.\u201d\n\nWhat are backers saying?\n\nThe comments section is a dark place. Here\u2019s a snippet:\n\nSome people do seemingly love theirs, though.\n\nWhat does the company have to say for itself?\n\nI called Lee to chat about his crowdfunding experience and how he\u2019s feeling now. About the shipping delays, he says, \u201cSometimes it does get emotionally and physically draining giving people bad news all day. Like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry your product\u2019s not there. I\u2019m sorry that it\u2019s delayed.\u2019 You wish you could give them better news, but you just can\u2019t because of circumstances.\u201d\n\nThis seems to be the biggest reason for the lack of communication on the company\u2019s end. \u201cFor us it wasn\u2019t a matter of hiding something, but it just got emotionally difficult,\u201d he says. But he followed up to say the company will ship all its units.\n\nFor future gadget makers, he recommends being \u201creally real based on costs and timeline and not [to] be too exuberant or overconfident.\u201d He also says, \u201cCrowdfunding is this amazing tool that lets a good idea be funded no matter who has it. It\u2019s way more democratic than VC funding. It does have this great potential \u2014 we just have to tweak the system and have people be more realistic about it.\u201d", "description": "The second version of the Podo camera launched on Kickstarter in 2016 and rapidly exceeded its funding goal. It raised more than $700,000 in funding. The company says it\u2019s still working on shipping units, but is committing to getting them out.
