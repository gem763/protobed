A complex deal embracing its creditors and the Chinese conglomerate, Fosun, had promised \u00a3900m of \u201cnew money\u201d in exchange for ownership of the company.\n\nBut barely a week before the rescue plan was due to be signed off, the lending banks demanded that Thomas Cook establish a \u00a3200m line of credit to cover losses in what was anticipated to be a dismal winter for travel firms. The government failed to step in.\n\nAt the CAA headquarters in central London, a \u201cwar room\u201d has been established to coordinate the repatriation.\n\nCAA chief executive, Richard Moriarty, said: \u201cWe have launched, at very short notice, what is effectively one of the UK\u2019s largest airlines.\n\n\u201cThe nature and scale of the operation means that unfortunately some disruption will be inevitable. We ask customers to bear with us as we work around the clock to bring them home.\u201d\n\nMr Shapps said: \u201cOur contingency planning has helped acquire planes from across the world \u2013 some from as far away as Malaysia \u2013 and we have put hundreds of people in call centres and at airports.\u201d\n\nThe basic idea is to mimic the Thomas Cook schedule of flights. But with a mix of aircraft that have very different capacities to the defunct company\u2019s fleet, managers of the \u201cpop-up\u201d airline are combining some flights and splitting others, with some passengers facing long journeys by coach once back in Britain to return to the airport from which they originally flew.\n\nOn day one, 64 missions were flown, carrying an estimated 15,000 passengers.\n\nMeanwhile, 800,000 UK customers of Thomas Cook with future bookings began the process of obtaining refunds \u2013 which could take two months or longer.\n\nFares on other airlines and prices for alternative package holidays soared on a surge in demand from people determined to travel.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s closest rivals, easyJet and TUI, saw their share prices soar \u2013 up 5 and 7 per cent on the day.\n\nThe market view is the removal of a giant competitor will allow these and other travel companies to increase prices over the winter and beyond.\n\nMark Tanzer, chief executive of the travel association, Abta, said: \u201cAlong with many others in the industry, I am extremely saddened by today\u2019s news about the demise of Thomas Cook.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the UK\u2019s most iconic travel companies and today thousands of staff are facing losing their jobs.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook was mired in debt at the time of its failure, and has very little of value beyond its take-off and landing slots at key hubs \u2013 notably Gatwick, the busiest single-runway airport in Europe. The portfolio of slots could raise \u00a350m.\n\nGovernments of Thomas Cook\u2019s destination countries expressed alarm at the collapse of the company.\n\nTunisia, in particular, has been reliant on the company for rebuilding its business from the UK. Tens of thousands of winter holidays to the North African nation have been cancelled, with little prospect of other airlines adding capacity to make up for Thomas Cook\u2019s demise.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u00a0has criticised travel firm bosses for paying themselves millions of pounds as their businesses \u201cgo down the tubes\u201d, following the collapse of Thomas Cook.
