There was also a chance that some EU countries, notably France, could demand a shorter extension, possibly of just days or weeks.\n\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said if the EU offers a delay until the end of January there would need to be an election in Britain, and this could be held before Christmas.\n\nJohnson paused the bill that would implement the agreement he reached with the other EU members, after votes on Tuesday in which parliament accepted the deal in principle but rejected the three-day timetable to enact it.\n\nThe government argued a tight schedule was necessary to meet next week\u2019s deadline but lawmakers said they needed more time.\n\nEU ENVOYS TO MEET ON FRIDAY\n\nAmbassadors of the 27 made no decision on an extension at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, senior diplomats said. The envoys will meet again on Friday and hope to decide then, and avoiding an emergency summit of leaders on the issue.\n\nThe one big uncertainty is whether France will agree. A source at President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said on Tuesday Paris was ready to grant an additional few days to facilitate the British parliament\u2019s vote but opposed any extension beyond that. On Wednesday, French officials stuck to that view, despite Tusk\u2019s recommendation for a longer delay.\n\n\u201cThe additional delay will be a few days, a few weeks maybe, but not up to January as some people are saying, that\u2019s just not possible,\u201d Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade, a member of the French parliament who handles European affairs for Macron\u2019s party, said.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seen at the House of Commons in London, Britain October 22, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\nAn EU official said Paris needed more time to decide its position because Macron is visiting the French island of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAny extension must be agreed unanimously among the EU 27. They have agreed twice to postpone Brexit from the original deadline of March 29 this year. Both times, the French complained but eventually relented.\n\nA \u201cGET BREXIT DONE\u201d ELECTION\n\nJohnson confounded some of his critics by emerging last week with a deal with the EU, which differs from an agreement reached by his predecessor Theresa May, mainly over how it handles the land border of British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nMay had agreed to apply some EU rules across all of the United Kingdom unless a new arrangement could be found to keep the Irish border open. Johnson would effectively create a new border in the Irish Sea, leaving Northern Ireland to apply EU rules while the rest of the United Kingdom goes its own way.\n\nThat has cost him the support of a Northern Irish party that had propped up his minority government, but could unlock the support of parliament that eluded May.\n\nIn the latest day of Brexit drama in Britain on Tuesday, lawmakers handed Johnson the first major parliamentary victory of his premiership by signalling their support for his deal in an early legislative hurdle.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson reacts as MPs gesture at the House of Commons in London, Britain October 22, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBut that was overshadowed minutes later when lawmakers defeated him on his timetable. Johnson had hoped to make the delay request unnecessary by passing the Brexit law within days.\n\nJohnson has suggested he would push for a new election, campaigning on a platform to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d if the EU agrees the full three-month delay that lawmakers forced him to request.\n\nHe cannot however call an election without the support of the opposition Labour Party, which has suggested it will support one only if the Brexit deadline is extended beyond election day.\n\nBrexit and fractured political allegiances are causing a headache for pollsters. Opinion polls put Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party either ahead of or level with Labour.", "description": "EU member states on Wednesday delayed a decision on whether to grant Britain a three-month Brexit extension, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said if the deadline is deferred to the end of January he would call an election by Christmas.", "authors": ["John Chalmers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444061333&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L21W", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
