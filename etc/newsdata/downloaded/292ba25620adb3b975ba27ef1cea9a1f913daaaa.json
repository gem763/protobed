'It's a cruel, cruel world nowadays when you're asked those questions two minutes after your World Cup is finished.\n\n'If you'd find it inside you to find a little bit of compassion just to ask more relevant questions... think about people's feelings for a minute. Just chill.\n\n'I came here with only one thought in my mind about winning and that thought's just disappeared now. Not 15 or 20 minutes ago. When the time comes, I'll tell it. Sweet?\n\nAustralia suffered a humiliating World Cup quarter-final defeat by England on Saturday\n\n'I know that is what the papers demand but perhaps whatever your news outlet is should think about people's feelings just for a minute.\n\n'When the time comes I'll tell them (Australia Rugby Football Union). They don't need to know today. It's not going to kill them.'\n\nBut now the Wallabies coach has left his role. He took over Australia in 2014 and led them to the World Cup final of 2015 \u2013 but this early exit has seen him fall on his sword.\n\nGlasgow Warriors boss and New Zealander Dave Rennie, has been linked with the post.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN OITA: Michael Cheika quit as Australia coach after his seventh consecutive mauling by England having been dumped out of the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/08/19949020-0-image-a-14_1571555329512.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
