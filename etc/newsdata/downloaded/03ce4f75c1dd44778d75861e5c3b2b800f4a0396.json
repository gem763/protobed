The movement has since snowballed into an anti-Chinese campaign.\n\nSeveral smaller rallies are occurring in further districts under a tight security clampdown. At least 11 subway stations were closed, and scores of police stood guard outside government offices.\n\nAt the Wong Tai Sin area, riot police twice fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters. Outside a city hall in the Tuen Mun area, police with batons charged at protesters who hurled umbrellas and other objects in their direction.\n\n\u201cToday we are out to tell the Communist Party that Hong Kong people have nothing to celebrate,\u201d said activist Lee Cheuk-yan as he led the downtown march. \u201cWe are mourning that in 70 years of Communist Party rule, the democratic rights of people in Hong Kong and China are being denied. We will continue to fight.\u201d\n\nActivists carried banners saying \u201cEnd dictatorial rule, return power to the people.\u201d\n\nChina's National Day is a tale of two cities: Beijing is celebrating with a show of military might and a massive parade, while Hong Kong is bracing for big pro-democracy protests. @willripleycnn and @David_Culver report: https://t.co/oi3ulA4iAQ pic.twitter.com/h1whQSIHtL \u2014 CNN International (@cnni) October 1, 2019\n\n\"It's quite a contrast in Hong Kong compared to Beijing.\"@AlexCrawfordSky is live from the banned protest march in Hong Kong as China marks 70 years of Communist rule.\n\n\n\nRead more: https://t.co/gXdvz1Bjtr pic.twitter.com/0GCPbow9pp \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) October 1, 2019\n\nMany shopping malls across Hong Kong were shut amid fears of chaos. Posters in the city called for the Oct. 1 anniversary to be marked as \u201cA Day of Grief.\u201d\n\nDressed in a black T-shirt and dark jeans, 40-year-old Bob Wong said his clothing expressed \u201cmourning\u201d over \u201cthe death of Hong Kong\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe popular LIHKG online chat forum used by protesters was inaccessible on cellphones, a move believed to have been made to prevent communication by protesters.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, as the city\u2019s government marked the anniversary in a solemn ceremony, police used pepper spray to break up a brief scuffle between Beijing supporters and a small group of pro-democracy protesters. Police lined up to separate the groups, but some minor scuffles ensued. Two pro-Beijing protesters were arrested.\n\nHong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung told hundreds of guests at a reception that the city has become \u201cunrecognizable\u201d due to violence by protesters. Cheung was representing the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, who led a delegation joining the National Day festivities in Beijing.\n\nCheung said Beijing fully supports the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that gives Hong Kong freedoms and rights not enjoyed on the mainland. The system was implemented when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nPolice warned Monday that hard-line protesters may engage in extreme acts that are \u201cone step closer to terrorism,\u201d such as killing police officers, posing as police officials to kill civilians and large-scale arson, including at gas stations. Activists ridiculed the assertion as a scare tactic.", "description": "Black-clad demonstrators held multiple pro-democracy rallies in Hong Kong on Tuesday as China\u2019s Communist Party celebrated its 70th year of rule.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d92fb8c210000330050eed1.jpeg?cache=djwchmlwfa&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
