PRECIOUS-Gold flat as markets eye trade talk cues, Brexit deal\n\n* Investors await gold pull back to step in -analyst\n\n* Japan, South Korea see weak exports in midst of trade spat\n\n\n\n(Adds technicals, details; updates prices)\n\nBy Karthika Suresh Namboothiri\n\nOct 21 (Reuters) - Gold prices were little changed on Monday\n\nas investors waited for more clarity on U.S.-China trade\n\nnegotiations, and Brexit after British parliamentarians delayed\n\na crucial vote on the divorce deal.\n\nSpot gold was flat at $1,490.03 per ounce as of 0519\n\nGMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 dipped slightly to $1,493.50.\n\nAsian shares edged higher, limiting bullion's gains, with\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nup 0.2%. MKTS/GLOB\n\n\"The markets are quite long, and people are worried about\n\nthe trade war. Investors are waiting for pull backs in gold to\n\nstep in again,\" AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes said.\n\n\"What has been supportive for gold are recessionary fears,\n\nand provided that remains in the headlines, it is a significant\n\nreason to stay long gold. Right now, there is no major catalyst\n\nto drive it any direction.\"\n\nThe long-standing Sino-U.S. trade war has taken a toll on\n\neconomies around the world with Japan's exports down for a 10th\n\nstraight month, South Korean exports plunging 19.5% in October,\n\nand Thai exports missing expectations.\n\nIn China, new home prices grew at a steady pace in\n\nSeptember, a relief for policymakers who remain wary of high\n\ndebt and bubble risk, and are refraining from stimulating the\n\nsector as the economy cools. Providing little comfort to market sentiment, British\n\nLawmakers on Saturday voted to withhold a decision on Prime\n\nMinister Boris Johnson's deal, a move that forced him to seek\n\nfrom the EU a third postponement of Britain's departure from the\n\nbloc. The vote for an extension dealt a blow to optimism that a\n\ndeal agreed last week would ensure Brexit happens with little\n\neconomic disruption.\n\nSpot gold looks neutral in a range of $1,479-$1,502 per\n\nounce, and an escape could suggest a direction, Reuters\n\ntechnical analyst Wang Tao said. Among other precious metals, silver rose 0.2% to\n\n$17.57 per ounce, and platinum XPT= rose 0.4% to $892.64.\n\nMeanwhile, palladium XPD= gained 0.9% to $1,770.07 an\n\nounce, slightly lower than a high of $1,783.21 it struck on\n\nThursday.\n\n\"Sell rates for palladium reached the highest level since\n\nJanuary. This suggests the recent rally has been driven by\n\nfundamentals, rather than speculative interest,\" ANZ Bank said\n\nin a note.\n\n\"And with the market likely to remain tight for the\n\nforeseeable future, we believe there is plenty more upside for\n\n(palladium)prices.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold flat as markets eye trade talk cues, Brexit deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8N174_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
