Hours later, he agreed to terms with the Patriots, who added Brown to a stacked receiving corps that also includes Julian Edelman and Josh Gordon.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Brown\u2019s former trainer filed suit against him alleging he sexually assaulted her in 2017 and 2018.\n\nBrown was not placed on the NFL\u2019s commissioner\u2019s exempt list this week because there is no criminal charge against him at the moment. He practiced with the Patriots during the week and traveled with them to Miami.\n\nNFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport reported that Patriots owner Robert Kraft said he would not have wanted New England to sign Brown if he had known about the rape allegation at the time.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
