Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) leading the charge to pass legislation aimed at warding off what he called \u201can imminent threat\u201d to the country\u2019s most iconic national park.\n\nHouse passage of Grijalva's bill, slated for a Wednesday floor vote, would ban mining on all federal land in Arizona, essentially creating a safety zone around the Grand Canyon. The Natural Resources Committee chairman said the measure also reflects the reality of climate change.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFundamentally ... this is what we need to be doing to deal with climate change in our public lands \u2014 to begin to reduce the extraction and promote the conservation side of it,\u201d Grijalva said.\n\nThe legislation, Grijalva said, is designed to guard against forthcoming recommendations from a White House Uranium Mining Group, consisting largely of industry leaders. As early as next month, the group could recommend mining uranium near the Grand Canyon.\n\nGrijalva said he previously thought a two-decade moratorium on mining near the national park, implemented in 2012, would be enough to ward off efforts to extract uranium and other minerals in nearby federal land. But now he isn\u2019t taking any risks.\n\n\u201cBefore the working group, the motivation for this was: We've wanted to do this for a long time, even during [the Obama administration]. But then the motivation became: They're going to lift the moratorium,\u201d Grijalva said during a sitdown interview with The Hill on Oct. 18.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always felt that we could wait these people out and then get back to it when we had an administration to work with. But then it was verified for us when we saw the working group. And then I said, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s pretty real.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump began signaling support for renewed uranium mining near the Grand Canyon early on in his presidency, starting with a 2017 decision to declare uranium a critical mineral for national security purposes. And earlier this year, the Commerce Department recommended mining reserves of uranium, a key component of nuclear weapons.\n\nBy July, the White House was putting together a working group to advise on methods of maintaining a strong nuclear fuel supply chain.\n\nThe working group, which has postponed its recommendations until mid-November, is including in their considerations a Cold War-era law that mandates the federal government buy uranium for enrichment for national security purposes. Uranium mining and utility industries argue the government is risking national security by relying on foreign governments for its uranium needs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping for immediate relief. ... We need long term demand that supports a viable front in nuclear fuel cycle, mining, conversion and enrichment,\u201d said Mark Chalmers, president and CEO of Energy Fuels, the largest uranium producer in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the largest consumer of uranium products in the world by country mile for nuclear power,\u201d he added in an Oct. 11 interview. \u201cEffectively looking to 2020 without relief we\u2019ll have zero capability.\u201d\n\nCritics of the working group argue the federal government already owns large stockpiles of uranium, used both for energy and atomic bombs. Additionally, they argue the fuel source is easy to obtain from U.S. allies like Canada and Australia, and that any move by the federal government to bolster domestic production would be akin to propping up an industry. The price of uranium is at its lowest level in more than a decade.\n\n\u201cSo the industry wants a sweetheart deal. They want to expedite their critical minerals so they can just keep skip the process. And then more importantly, a guaranteed buyback,\u201d Grijalva said. \u201cTalk about creeping socialism. My God, we\u2019re guaranteeing a revenue-based system. That rarely, if at all, happens.\u201d\n\nIf the White House decides to adopt suggestions by the working group that benefit the uranium industry, it could then choose to overturn the 2012 mining ban that put nearly 1,562 square miles off limits outside the boundaries of the Grand Canyon. Energy Fuels, a uranium producer, holds 84 claims on mines within the Grand Canyon mining ban boundary.\n\nGrijalva said his bill aims to cement that ban, an action he wished he could have done under the Obama administration, but lacked the political backing to do so with then-Sen. Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidWarren's careful approach with media pays off Trump thanks Reid for warning Democrats not to underestimate him Reid warns Democrats not to underestimate Trump MORE (D-Nev.) as Senate majority leader.\n\n\u201c[The moratorium] was a pretty significant victory for us at that point because, you know,\n\nHarry Reid was in charge of the other side from Nevada and wasn't always open to restricting mining or reforming,\u201d Grijalva said.\n\nNow, a number of Democrats, including presidential hopefuls like Sen.

Republicans have largely pointed to the potential for job creation in their support of mining.\n\nGrijalva\u2019s bill, though, is likely dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate. There is no companion legislation in the upper chamber, even though his measure has support from some White House hopefuls.\n\nBut even without making it to the president\u2019s desk, Grijalva said House passage will mark a political victory, much like the 20-year ban during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to profile momentum, and get the fact that there is an alternative out there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it's against what the administration is doing.\u201d", "description": "Democrats are preparing to counter any White House efforts to allow mining near the Grand Canyon, with Rep.
