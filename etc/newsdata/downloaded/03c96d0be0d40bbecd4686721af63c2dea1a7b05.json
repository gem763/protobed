U.S.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate futures were at $58.15, down 49\n\ncents.\n\n\"Financial data was anything but encouraging yesterday,\"\n\nsaid Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM, pointing to sluggish\n\nmanufacturing numbers in leading European economies and Japan.\n\nReuters reported on Monday that Saudi Arabia had restored\n\nmore than 75% of crude output lost after attacks on its oil\n\ninstallations and would return to full volumes by early next\n\nweek. But the Wall Street Journal said repairs at the plants could\n\ntake months longer than anticipated. \"There remains conflicting news coming out of Saudi Arabia,\n\nbut an increasing number of reports pointing to Saudi Aramco\n\npurchasing external products and potentially also crude to meet\n\nits term commitments do not give the impression that an imminent\n\nreturn to full capacity is in sight,\" consultancy JBC Energy\n\nsaid.\n\nState-run oil company Aramco has stepped up purchases of\n\nproducts such as naphtha, gasoline and diesel from Europe and\n\nelsewhere. Still, oil prices remain at comparatively elevated levels\n\nfor the year in the wake of the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi\n\nArabia's largest oil-processing facility that halved output in\n\nthe world's top oil exporter.\n\nAn increase in U.S. oil exports to Asia to replace Saudi\n\ncrude and a reduction in U.S. imports from Iraq meant crude\n\ninventories in the United States could be lower than expected,\n\nsaid Mike Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nEuropean powers - Britain, Germany and France - backed the\n\nUnited States in blaming Iran for the Saudi attack, urging\n\nTehran to agree to new talks with world powers on its nuclear\n\nand missile programmes and regional security.\n\nMeanwhile, a preliminary Reuters poll found on Monday that\n\nU.S. crude oil and distillate stockpiles were expected to have\n\ndropped last week. EIA/S\n\nSeven analysts estimated, on average, that crude inventories\n\nfell by 800,000 barrels in the week to Sept. 20.\n\nThe poll was conducted ahead of inventory reports from the\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute, an industry group, to be released\n\non Tuesday and from the U.S. government's Energy Information\n\nAdministration on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 5-Oil prices fall due to weak economic data, Saudi output recovery", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
