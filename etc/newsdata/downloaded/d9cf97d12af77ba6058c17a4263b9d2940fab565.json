Pendley's email shows the move is proceeding despite pushback from lawmakers. Democrats have been particularly vocal in opposing the move, but both the House and Senate Interior appropriations bills for next year lack funding for the relocation.\n\nPendley's timeline also lands as the downsides of agency relocations are coming into sharper focus.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture similarly announced it would move its two research agencies to Kansas City, but internal memos obtained by The Hill showed one of those agencies, the Economic Research Service, was delaying or canceling many of its projects and reports after losing nearly 80 percent of its staff.\n\nPendley said BLM would consider delayed move dates for employees with extenuating circumstances and also laid out options for those who do not wish to move, including retirement or help moving elsewhere within Interior.\n\n\"If you wish to continue working in the Washington, D.C., area, we will help you identify positions in the BLM or the Department,\" he said.\n\nRead more on BLM's plans here.\n\nHappy Tuesday!

The government agency anticipates 2019 will be one of the top five hottest years on record. This past July was recorded as the hottest month on Earth.\n\nRead more on the NOAA report here.\n\nD-LISTED: The Trump administration announced Tuesday that a songbird once threatened to the point of near-extinction has rebounded to the point where federal protections are no longer necessary.\n\nThe Kirtland's warbler, officially added to the Endangered Species List in 1967, will be removed from the list of protected species on Nov. 8. Interior Department officials made the announcement at a news conference in Michigan alongside local environmental officials, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"We've transitioned from bringing this species out of the emergency room to providing it with long-term stability,\" Dan Kennedy, endangered species coordinator for Michigan's Department of Natural Resources told the AP. \"The job now is to ensure that this species continues to have a healthy population.\"\n\nAt the species' most-threatened point, just 167 pairs of Kirtland's warbler were counted in the wild. That number has since surged to as many as 2,300 estimated pairs, according to officials.\n\nHabitat destruction remains a top issue for the birds, which roost in rural northern Michigan during the spring and summer before heading for the Bahamas when the weather changes.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nOUTSIDE THE BELTWAY:\n\nOil lower as tensions grow ahead of U.S.-China trade talks, Marketwatch reports\n\nQatar seeks Exxon, Shell, other 'big players' for gas expansion, Bloomberg reports\n\nPG&E considers power outages in Northern California as fire danger rises, the Los Angeles Times reports\n\nICYMI: Stories from Tuesday\n\n-Emails show BLM relocation could begin within five months\n\n-September ties record as second hottest ever for that month\n\n-Trump administration removing songbird from endangered list\n\n-Poll: Warren closing in on Biden's lead with climate-focused voters\n\n-300 arrested in London climate protests", "description": "COUNTDOWN TO BLM MOVE BEGINS: The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) controversial move out west could begin within as little as five months, according to an email sent by the agency's acting director William Pendley.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/coloradoriver-drought-getty2015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
