After months of on-record only communication, would they take the meeting?\n\n'There's no escape': Weinstein accusers on hope and despair in the #MeToo era Read more\n\nThe fittingly cinematic episode is one of many explosive revelations in She Said, Twohey and Kantor\u2019s book detailing their sprawling investigation into Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual predation \u2013 which won a Pulitzer, along with Ronan Farrow\u2019s expos\u00e9 for the New Yorker \u2013 and its aftermath as gasoline for the #MeToo movement.\n\nTwohey and Kantor\u2019s 3,300-word article, the first of many on Weinstein, triggered an avalanche of women\u2019s accounts of sexual harassment and assault under the hashtag #MeToo, first coined years earlier by the activist Tarana Burke. Since then, the tide of pent-up frustration and calls for accountability have exposed and stalled the careers of prominent men such as Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, and Les Moonves, to name a few. (Weinstein, whose criminal trial for rape and predatory sexual assault has been delayed until January 2020, has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex and pleaded not guilty).\n\nThe final showdown with Weinstein is just one of several revelations in She Said that portend a much deeper story than the one which seized headlines two years ago.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harvey Weinstein arrives to court with his lawyer for arraignment over a new indictment for sexual assault on 26 August 2019 in New York City.

It details the previously unrevealed story of Irwin Reiter, Weinstein\u2019s corporate accountant for over 30 years, who served as the investigation\u2019s \u201cdeep throat\u201d by providing crucial company documents in the final stages. And it describes how the famed attorney Gloria Allred cultivated a public reputation as a feminist crusader while she and her firm privately negotiated and buried sexual harassment settlements for victims \u2013 including of Weinstein and the Olympic gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar \u2013 from which they took a 30% to 40% cut. There\u2019s also a damning memo from Allred\u2019s similarly notorious daughter, Lisa Bloom, who was paid $895 an hour by Weinstein for counsel on \u201cpositive reputation management\u201d. (Bloom later told the reporters that her work for Weinstein was a \u201ccolossal mistake\u201d.)\n\nWe pretty quickly realized that our first Weinstein articles were actually just the beginning Megan Twohey\n\nSupporting these bombshells are a mountain of smaller, quieter yet still powerful actions \u2013 Kantor fielding nervous texts from Gwyneth Paltrow as she deliberated going on the record (which she ultimately did in the second article, published 10 October), or crafting the perfectly calibrated email to coax the actor Rose McGowan into a phone call. There\u2019s Twohey, knocking on the door of a woman who mysteriously left Weinstein\u2019s company in 1990, skillfully volleying small talk into an interview pitch. And there\u2019s an email from Laura Madden, one of the first women to go on the record against Weinstein, recounting how a conversation with her teenage daughters anchored her decision to speak.\n\nMore than anything, She Said depicts the incremental work of pulling at long neglected threads as well as the institutional heft and individual bravery required to hold powerful abuses to account.\n\nBut She Said goes much deeper than a compelling play-by-play of nailing the first Weinstein story. The immediate aftermath of publication, when the dam broke on story after story of sexual indignity, workplace harassment, or assault, \u201conly made us feel greater responsibility\u201d, Kantor told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cWe said to ourselves: we\u2019ve got to try to finally answer some of these lingering questions from the Weinstein story. How can a company become so complicit in predation? What are the systems that enable this kind of abuse? In the face of a \u201cstaggering\u201d wave of personal and institutional responses, said Twohey, \u201cWe just decided that the most important thing we could do was keep reporting.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Producers of the film Shakespeare in Love, including Harvey Weinstein, and Gwyneth Paltrow, who was later an early, crucial source in Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor\u2019s reporting.

Rowena Chiu, who didn\u2019t tell her family about her 1998 settlement with Weinstein until after Kantor arrived at her Silicon Valley home, now on the record for the first time. And Perkins, formerly of the Miramax London office, who \u201calways had a larger vision of what this was about\u201d, said Kantor. \u201cShe said even as early as that, this isn\u2019t about getting Harvey; this is about an entire system that silences women.\u201d\n\nIn the preface, Kantor and Twohey explicitly pose the question: did the cultural change go too far? Or not far enough?\n\nYou can\u2019t fix a problem you can\u2019t see. All of us collectively are still in the process of seeing this problem clearly Jodi Kantor\n\nIt\u2019s less the reporters\u2019 paradigm than \u201cthe question we saw play out in the world\u201d, said Kantor. \u201cWe experienced the power of the post-Weinstein reckoning and this feeling of buried truth pouring out \u2013 this display of mass accountability without precedent.\u201d\n\nBut they also watched the conversations around #MeToo get complicated, and polarizing. The past two years have revealed \u201cthree questions about #MeToo that remain totally unresolved\u201d, said Kantor \u2013 what behaviors are under scrutiny? What tools can evaluate truth? And what are the appropriate measures for accountability and punishment?\n\nNearly a year ago, Kantor and Twohey watched as a previously unknown psychology professor from Palo Alto, California, testified before the Senate judiciary committee about her allegation of sexual assault, in high school, by then supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The final two chapters of She Said follow the personal journey of Dr Christine Blasey Ford as she deliberated over going public with her story \u2013 a journey more fraught than previously revealed.\n\nThe book recounts a meeting, earlier this year, of several high profile figures of the #MeToo stories \u2013 Ford, Paltrow, Madden, and others as they reflect on the personal effects of coming forward and ponder the unresolved questions of the movement. What is clear, said Kantor, is that \u201cnone of us are done dealing with what\u2019s happened in the past. You can\u2019t fix a problem you can\u2019t see. And it\u2019s become clear that all of us collectively are still in the process of seeing this problem clearly.\u201d\n\nFor the book, part of that clarity resides in upholding and demystifying the \u201crigorous standards\u201d of investigative journalism.\n\nWith She Said, \u201cI want [readers] to feel ultimately that carefully documented stories, high quality journalism really can fuel social progress,\u201d said Kantor.\n\n\u201cAt a time when even the truth can feel so compromised and everything can feel so stuck, I want them to believe in that power, that potential.\u201d", "description": "Journalists Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor spoke to the Guardian about their sprawling investigation into Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual predation as detailed in their new book", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5bde3b34b1b78ffd31357bee6b7b4601def5170/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0187b8e80a0d123e61c3e4c9f63fac1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
