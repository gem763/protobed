About whether the actions of a young American woman, a missionary without any medical training, contributed to Twalali Kifabi\u2019s death.\n\nZuriah is not the only relative in Uganda demanding answers over the work of the US missionary organisation Serving His Children (SHC) and its founder, Renee Bach, who has now left the country.\n\nFamilies of other children who died subsequently seeking help from SHC \u2013 at least 105 other cases over several years \u2013 are also seeking accountability in a court case to be decided next year. It is alleged that Bach, 30, involved herself in medical interventions with children, including blood transfusions, despite having no qualifications either as a doctor or a nurse.\n\nAmid growing unease about the behaviour of so-called \u201cwhite saviours\u201d in Africa \u2013 often unqualified evangelicals working for small missionary outfits \u2013 the long-running allegations against Bach and SHC have taken the issue to a whole new level of seriousness.\n\nThe case being played out in Uganda, and in the international media, has presented starkly contradictory accounts of what occurred at SHC on Bach\u2019s watch.\n\nFounded in Uganda in 2009 by Bach \u201cto promote evangelism, provide welfare for the needy and empower families\u201d, SHC was registered in the country as an NGO two years later.\n\nOn its website, the group describes itself in grandiose terms as a \u201cGod-breathed and directed ministry working to end malnutrition in families and communities\u201d that \u201cpartner[s] with the government of Uganda to provide inpatient therapeutic care for children suffering from severe acute malnutrition\u201d.\n\nBut critics of SHC and Bach paint a different picture \u2013 not least in its early years \u2013 of an amateur and enthusiastic group whose staff, including Bach, sometimes participated in medical treatment for which they were not qualified.\n\nIt is a depiction that SHC and Bach\u2019s lawyer, David Gibbs, have pushed back against in the strongest terms, defending their work and describing accusers in Uganda of being \u201creputational terrorists\u201d spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d. They have suggested in court papers that some of those making allegations were former and disgruntled employees and associates with axes to grind.\n\nAccording to Zuriah, SHC, then based in the eastern Ugandan town of Jinja and run by Bach, seemed at first a world apart from the local health centres.\n\nCaretakers and patients received free food, and Bach herself came across as warm, engaged and compassionate, offering hugs and comforting the mothers whose children were sick.\n\n\u201cWe thought she loved us. She would hug you to calm you down. She told us our children would be well,\u201d Zuriah recounted to the Guardian.\n\nZuriah says she knew Bach well enough by sight to be able to be certain of identifying her, adding that she took her grandson to SHC when he fell ill. She insists she saw Bach administer medicine to Twalali and place him on oxygen.\n\nBach\u2019s lawyers say that is impossible, claiming she was out of the country when Twalali was treated. They have provided passport pages to the court as evidence.\n\nOther witnesses in Uganda have told similar stories to media outlets, including the Guardian.\n\nMothers of children who died at SHC \u2013 including Twalali\u2019s mother, Zubeda Gimbo \u2013 claim in a court case, filed earlier this year in Jinja, that they were led to believe Bach was a trained doctor. Bach emphatically denies she ever sought to give that impression.\n\nOne focus of contention has been a series of photographs depicting Bach in situations with a medical care context.\n\nAnother issue has been claims that Bach herself carried out interventions, including administering IV drips into veins. On this there is less argument.\n\nBach has admitted sometimes inserting drips, claiming that she had been trained how to do this by a health professional on a \u201cwilderness first aid course\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, SHC deny Bach passed herself off as a doctor, but admit she regularly helped in \u201ccrisis situations\u201d using \u201cskills\u201d learned from Ugandan healthcare professionals.\n\n\u201cAs Ms Bach worked along[side] Ugandan medical professionals, she learned skills to help provide assistance as necessary; and she often assisted nurses and other healthcare professionals to serve in crisis situations. She never represented herself as a doctor or nurse, but she made nutritional care provided by qualified medical professionals more accessible for families in rural areas,\u201d said the statement.\n\nIt is not only those involved in the case making accusations. Grace Adikin, 35, said she became concerned about the circumstances of her two-year-old child\u2019s death after the allegations about SHC emerged.\n\nShe was referred to SHC by a friend in 2014. When she reached the mission, she said, the infant was quickly taken away from her by a woman she identified as Renee Bach herself.\n\nThree hours later, when the child was brought back to her, she could see a cannula had been inserted. She alleges that she was told a blood transfusion had been necessary.\n\nThe infant was then taken to a children\u2019s hospital but died shortly after arrival.\n\n\u201cRenee put us in her car and drove us to a nearby Nalufenya children\u2019s hospital,\u201d Adikin said. With all the allegations about Renee\u2019s work now, I have also become suspicious,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey did a blood transfusion without telling us what the child was suffering from.\u201d\n\nDespite three approaches from the Guardian, which contacted both Bach\u2019s lawyer and SHC, the NGO did not engage with specific questions. They instead replied with a press release issued in June \u2013 despite having put Bach forward for TV interviews in the US.\n\nIn responses to the allegations over recent months, SHC and Bach\u2019s lawyer have insisted that the lawsuit filed against Bach by two mothers is \u201centirely without merit\u201d, insisting that one of the children named in the lawsuit was never treated by SHC, while the other child was treated there while \u201cBach was not in Uganda\u201d.\n\nIn the release, the organisation defended its work, suggesting that media reporting had put Bach and SHC at risk.\n\n'We see mothers die and children die': Uganda's teen pregnancy crisis | Suzanne Moore Read more\n\n\u201cFor the last 10 years, Renee Bach and Serving His Children have served malnourished children in Uganda. Reputational terrorists are attacking Renee Bach and Serving His Children with false allegations using the platform of social media to create a false reality without factual evidence.\n\n\u201cThese escalating attacks are currently threatening the personal safety of Ms Bach and her family, as people are believing these lies about her and the services provided by the organisation. Several media outlets are escalating these safety risks by globally sharing grossly false information.\u201d\n\nThe press release quoted Gibbs: \u201cIt is sad when people spend their time attacking the good work of others. Renee is innocent of the nonsensical allegations being levelled at her by people who are leveraging the power of social media for their own agenda without verification of facts.\u201d\n\nDespite the denials, Primah Kwagala, the executive director of Women\u2019s Pro-bono Initiative, the Ugandan organisation representing the women, said she was anxious to see Bach in court in Uganda, primarily to underline the message that organisations such as SHC cannot come to the country and operate without proper checks and balances.\n\n\u201cI want Renee to know that she did something wrong and she needs to be held accountable,\u201d said Kwagala. \u201cIt is for people to know that if they do what Renee has done, including Ugandans, they will have to pay.\u201d", "description": "Unqualified American missionary denies she sought to portray herself as a doctor at centre where at least 105 children died", "authors": ["Alon Mwesigwa", "Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba427a6344029c00dce6b2d04e87926e50414cf3/0_16_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f31d13f7d2fc77493c4e0e176757060d", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
