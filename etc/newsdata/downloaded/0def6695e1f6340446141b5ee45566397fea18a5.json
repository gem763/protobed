The Dealmaster is back with another round of deals to share. Today's list is headlined by a discount on the 128GB variant of Apple's 10.2-inch iPad, which is currently down to $399.99 from its standard $429. While that's not a huge drop, it's worth noting since Apple only just released this seventh-gen iPad last week. So if you were thinking about picking one up from an Apple Store anyway, you might want to save a few bucks by shopping online instead.\n\nAs for the iPad itself, we haven't reviewed it, but it's not a massive update over the sixth-gen iPad. It runs on the same A10 Fusion chip, still has a non-laminated display, and still has thicker bezels than an iPad Air or iPad Pro. But it increases the display size from 9.7 inches to 10.2 inches, now works with Apple's Smart Keyboard\u2014which remains fine as a keyboard but generally causes less friction than a Bluetooth keyboard\u2014and bumps up the RAM from 2GB to 3GB, which makes multitasking with the new and improved iPadOS more manageable. Most importantly, it remains the most affordable tablet in Apple's lineup.\n\nIf you don't envision yourself treating your iPad like a pseudo-laptop, you can save a few bucks by picking up a sixth-gen iPad before stock runs dry, but this is a useful deal for the new model this early in its lifespan.\n\nIf you don't need a new iPad, though, we also have deals on Vizio and Samsung 4K TVs, robot vacuums, Philips Hue smart bulbs, and more. Have a look for yourself below.\n\nNote: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTop 10 deals of the day\n\nLaptop and desktop PC deals\n\nAsus ROG Strix G gaming laptop - Intel Core i5-9300H, 15.6-inch 1080p 120Hz, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, GTX 1660 Ti 6GB for $999 at Walmart (normally $1,299).\n\nat Walmart (normally $1,299).
