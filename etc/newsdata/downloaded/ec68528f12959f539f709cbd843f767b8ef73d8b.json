The Senate voted 54-41 to block the national emergency, and the House voted 236-174, with 11 Republicans in each chamber voting with Democrats.\n\nThe measure was aimed at preventing the diversion of $3.6 billion for military construction projects toward the construction of Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border without congressional approval.\n\nThe vote marked the second time this year that Congress has approved legislation challenging Trump\u2019s authority to invoke emergency powers to build his wall. The president vetoed an earlier resolution in March.\n\nTrump has in recent weeks simultaneously insisted that the national emergency is necessary to address the situation at the border while touting progress on barriers and a steady drop in apprehensions of illegal crossings.\n\nHis administration has made cracking down on illegal and legal immigration a focal point. It also has issued a number of executive orders and new policies to pursue that agenda and urged Congress to pass stricter immigration laws.", "description": "President Trump on Tuesday night vetoed a joint resolution that would overturn\u00a0his emergency declaration at the southern border to aid construction of a wall, the second time he has been forced to do so.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpun_092319getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
