But risks can be managed, and fear can be tamed. That\u2019s the theme of an upcoming event focused on entrepreneurs hosted by HSBC Bank Canada, which features outspoken \u201cdragon\u201d investor Lane Merrifield, one of the stars of CBC\u2019s Dragons\u2019 Den.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine that Merrifield \u2014 once the youngest executive vice-president at Disney, and founder of Club Penguin, the world\u2019s largest social network ever built exclusively for young users \u2014 started out as a child who was once paralyzed by fear.\n\n\u201cDeathly afraid\u201d are the words he uses to describe his early life. He turned down opportunities to attend summer camps because he was afraid to be separated from family and afraid of the dark. Worried about sleeping alone in his room, he camped out on the floor of his siblings\u2019 bedrooms until he was a teenager.\n\n\u201cI needed to run my own life,\u201d says Merrifield, \u201cinstead of letting fear take the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had some real anxiety issues,\u201d he said recently. \u201cBut I decided that I couldn\u2019t live like that any longer. I needed to run my own life, instead of letting fear take the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager, he made his first concrete steps to address his fears head-on with a detailed step-by-step approach. At the time, Merrifield found it challenging to even walk into a video store and select some movies to rent.\n\n\u201cI concentrated on just taking the first step,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI used to count how many steps it would take to get into that video store and back out again. What\u2019s it going to take for me to just get out of the car, and then once I\u2019m out of the car now I\u2019m just going to walk into that video store. Now once I\u2019m in that video store, I\u2019m going to look up but I\u2019m going to find the children\u2019s section and I\u2019m going to hang out there for a little bit. It was always about that next step.\u201d\n\nMerrifield also took a big risk when he told Dave Krysko, his boss at New Horizons Interactive, that he and co-worker Lance Priebe were so passionate about developing the idea that became Club Penguin that they would have to resign if they couldn\u2019t work on the project there.\n\nBut that risk paid off, when his boss agreed to develop the product in-house. Club Penguin became wildly popular among kids worldwide and spurred a US$350-million buyout by Disney in 2007. Merrifield continued on as executive vice-president of Disney Interactive until 2013, when he helped found Wheelhouse Ventures, a group that invests in tech companies and helps small start-ups to grow.\n\nTaking the fear out of taking risk is a theme that also resonates with HSBC Bank Canada, which continues to find new ways to serve small business clients across the country. As these ventures face the risks and challenges of growing their businesses, HSBC Bank Canada has their backs \u2013 by providing financial solutions tailor-made for their needs and challenges, including a range of everyday banking solutions, credit and lending tools, payment solutions and business credit card offerings.\n\nFor example, with HSBC Small Business Banking, small business owners can manage and track transactions through mobile and online banking, receive support from a dedicated HSBC Business Relationship Manager and enjoy a tailored banking solution that fits their small business. They can apply for a small business line of credit and receive a decision quickly when they use HSBC eCredit\u2122.\n\nHSBC Bank Canada also helps small businesses to manage their cash flow by offering a range of payment choices that allow them to easily receive funds from customers and make payments to vendors. In addition, the HSBC BusinessVantage\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae also provides features designed to suit small business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fearless and I don\u2019t love risk,\u201d says Merrifield. \u201cBut today, I can easily talk to audiences about Club Penguin and the sale to Disney. I appear on television on Dragon\u2019s Den, which is watched by viewers from coast to coast. But that all started with taking the first step to conquer my fears.\u201d\n\nThe HSBC Bank Canada event is scheduled for Nov. 28 in Toronto. The event also offers a workshop by Canadian technology trend guru Amber Mac on how small businesses can benefit from tech disruption.\n\nThis story was created by Content Works, Postmedia\u2019s commercial content division, on behalf of HSBC Bank Canada.", "description": "Lane Merrifield of Dragons\u2019 Den will share his thoughts on fear and risk-taking at an HSBC Small Business Banking event in November.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/lanemerrifield.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
