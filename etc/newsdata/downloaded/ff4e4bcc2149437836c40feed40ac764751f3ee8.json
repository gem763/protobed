It was Svensson\u2019s first goal of the season, and Lodeiro provided the capper 17 minutes later.\n\nWhen the final whistle blew, Rimando stood in the penalty area for a few minutes, accepting handshakes and hugs from teammates and opponents. It was a memorable farewell to MLS after 20 seasons for Rimando, who was the best player for Salt Lake but couldn\u2019t withstand all of Seattle\u2019s pressure and was eventually beaten late.\n\n\u201cThis is the end of my career, but maybe I\u2019ll stay in the game somehow,\u201d Rimando said. \u201cRight now, it sucks because we wanted to go a bit further, even though people didn\u2019t have us in mind. The guys gave it their all. All we could have done is give it our all and that\u2019s what we did. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t come out on the right side of the results.\u201d\n\nRimando finished with seven saves in his final game. He will leave MLS as the league leader in wins, saves, shutouts and games.\n\n\u201cTomorrow? I\u2019m going to take my kids to school in the morning. \u2026 I\u2019ll wake up and get them breakfast and check them into school. Then kick my feet up and have a couple whiskeys maybe, and relax,\u201d Rimando said.\n\nSeattle will face Los Angeles FC or the LA Galaxy in the conference final next Tuesday. The Sounders will host if it\u2019s the Galaxy; they will go to Southern California if LAFC is their opponent. Seattle won each of its last two trips to the conference final under the old format of the MLS Cup playoffs.\n\n\u201cOrganizationally this franchise has always been about winning and we want to continue that,\u201d Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer said.\n\nSvensson\u2019s role for Seattle is a defensive midfielder, but he was the scorer the Sounders needed on a night Rimando kept RSL in the game.\n\nWhile RSL controlled possession, Seattle dominated scoring chances, seemingly each one getting closer to finally getting past Rimando. Leerdam had a pair of chances denied early in the second half. Rimando first batted away a volleyed attempt then made a quick reaction to keep Leerdam\u2019s deflected cross off Nedum Onuoha from going in for an own goal.\n\nJust moments before Svensson\u2019s goal, Rimando tipped Cristian Roldan\u2019s header over the crossbar at the last moment.\n\nBut Rimando was helpless on Seattle\u2019s breakthrough. The corner kick from Lodeiro came to the near post and without a defender on the goal line at the post Rimando couldn\u2019t react in time.\n\n\u201cIt was a great corner. We\u2019ve been working on that for a long time now,\u201d Svensson said.\n\nLodeiro\u2019s insurance goal was started by a perfect pass from Brad Smith to Raul Ruidiaz, who smartly left it off for Lodeiro to finish.\n\nSalt Lake\u2019s Everton Luiz was shown a red card in the 85th minute for a challenge on Svensson. RSL finished with just seven shots and only one on target.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nick Rimando did all he could for the first hour in an attempt to prolong his career for one more game and frustrate the Seattle Sounders.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/mls_real_salt_lake_sounders_soccer_15671_c0-99-2377-1485_s1200x700.jpg?b8cd2a888e12967d1cb3f401e67bbad612550ed7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
