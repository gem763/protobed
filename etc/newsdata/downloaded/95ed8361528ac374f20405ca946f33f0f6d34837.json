And with just one goal scored for Chelsea the following season, his reputation as one of Europe's most prolific scorers lay firmly in tatters.\n\nFalcao now plays for Galatasaray following spells at Manchester United and Chelsea\n\nFalcao was a spectacular flop on loan at United, scoring just four times despite huge wages\n\nHe then tried his luck at Chelsea, but endured just as disappointing a season there\n\nYet Falcao fought on and returned to his former scoring ways at his parent club, and captained the principality side to the league title and Champions League semi-finals in 2017.\n\nBut with the club struggling to survive in a surprise relegation battle last season, Falcao opted to move to Turkey in search of a fresh challenge, having scored 83 goals in 140 games in France.\n\nThe 33-year-old's spell in Istanbul has failed to spark into life so far.\n\nDespite Falcao contributing just one goal in his first five appearances, former Turkish international Tuncay Sanli has backed him to find his feet sooner rather than later.\n\nHe told Goal: 'When he is in the 18-yard box, he will score. He is a big player but he still needs time.\n\n'Everywhere it is the same if you are a big name and that means pressure. It is too early now [to make judgements]. Lots of teams have started poorly. That's the situation.'\n\nRyan Babel\n\nHolland international Babel represented Liverpool between 2007 and 2011, but the current Galatasaray star has reflected on his experience at Anfield negatively.\n\nThe wideman scored just 22 goals in almost 150 appearances for the Reds, and became increasingly marginalised under Rafa Benitez, Roy Hodgson and Kenny Dalglish.\n\nFormer Liverpool winger Ryan Babel struggled to make an impact during his time in England\n\nRyan Babel scored for Fulham against his former side Liverpool last season but soon left\n\n'I wanted to develop well and \u2013 as they promised me back then before I joined \u2013 just to be given the guidance I needed to become a better player,' Babel told The Guardian last year. 'That didn't happen and for a lot of different reasons I didn't fulfil my potential I guess.'\n\nThe 32-year-old later experienced a turbulent one-season spell with UAE side Al-Ain, which ended after he was demoted to the reserves following a social media post seemingly criticising supporters, and eventually returned to the Premier League with Fulham last season.\n\nBut after the London outfit were relegated, Babel secured a move to Istanbul on a three-year deal and has since scored two goals this term in seven appearances.\n\nJean Michael Seri\n\nFulham flop Seri is currently spending the campaign on loan at Galatasaray from Craven Cottage, having been lambasted for his struggles last campaign following a big-money switch from Nice.\n\nHaving once been on the verge of a huge transfer to Barcelona, Seri eventually moved to London in a club-record \u00a325million deal and was a regular under Slavisa Jokanovic, Claudio Ranieri and Scott Parker.\n\nFulham flop Jean Michael Seri is spending the season on loan in Turkey from the London side\n\nSeri could not stop Fulham suffering relegation from the Premier League last season\n\nBut his performances in the centre of midfield were widely criticised following a meagre return of just one goal and two assists in 32 top-flight appearances, and Seri departed the club following their relegation.\n\nSince joining Galatasaray on a one-year deal, which features an option to buy for \u00a315.2m next summer, Seri has enjoyed a steady start to life at his new side. He has already netted his maiden goal in the Super Lig within his first three appearances, and has also featured twice in the Turkish outfit's Champions League group stage campaign.\n\nSteven Nzonzi\n\nNzonzi's arrival at Roma from Sevilla last season was originally viewed as another shrewd piece of business from sporting director Monchi.\n\nBut the midfielder struggled to adjust to Eusebio Di Francesco's style of play despite being part of France's World Cup-winning squad, and was only able to slightly revive his confidence under successor Claudio Ranieri. And the arrival of the new man at the helm, Paulo Fonseca, Nzonzi was sidelined and openly floated on the transfer market.\n\nDespite a return to his home nation appearing the most likely move, Nzonzi instead joined Galatasaray on loan and with an option to make the deal permanent.\n\nBefore his switch to Istanbul, the 30-year-old boasts 195 Premier League appearances during spells with Blackburn Rovers and Stoke City.\n\nSteven Nzonzi struggled to fit into Paulo Fonseca's system at Roma and was also loaned out\n\nNzonzi was a success as a defensive midfielder at both Blackburn and Stoke\n\nNzonzi had joined the former in 2009 from Amiens and rapidly established himself as a star performer under Sam Allardyce. In his first campaign, the midfielder was named as the club's player of the season and subsequently penned a new five-year deal. However, the next term saw the Blackburn relegated and Nzonzi expressed his desire to leave.\n\nHe then ensured he would remain in the top flight by moving to Stoke, and Potters boss Tony Pulis expressed his belief that the Frenchman would one day play in the Champions League. But his spell in the West Midlands was soured by two consecutive transfer requests, both of which were rejected.\n\nNzonzi later forced through a transfer to Sevilla in a \u00a37m deal, where he was a success. His performances in Turkey have already seen him linked with a move to Torino.\n\nSofiane Feghouli\n\nGalatasaray's clash with Genclerbirligi earlier this month was marred by Feghouli's substitution. When the former West Ham winger was removed he headed straight to the dressing room, seemingly astonished at his manager's decision.\n\nThe 29-year-old has struggled to repeat his performances from last season in Turkey, and is yet to score in the top flight this term. His reaction to his withdrawal hinted at mounting frustration, despite originally impressing following his switch from London in 2017.\n\nSofiane Feghouli had played an integral role in Galatasaray's domestic treble last campaign\n\nFeghouli previously had a forgettable spell at West Ham before leaving to no-one's dismay\n\nFeghouli had played an integral role in Galatasaray's triumph in Super Lig last campaign, and the Turkish giants also clinched the domestic treble with the Algerian wideman often found in relentless form.\n\nBut the star had failed to impress after joining the Hammers from Valencia in 2016, and scored just three English top-flight goals in 21 appearances.\n\nMario Lemina\n\nFormer Juventus midfielder Lemina was shipped out to Galatasaray on loan after demanding to leave Southampton in the summer. The Gabonese international had openly revealed he wished to depart St Mary's after two seasons in the Premier League, in a move which drew ire from large groups of the club's supporters.\n\nHe had revealed to France Football: 'As early as last year, I had set my conditions: I wanted to go elsewhere this summer. I had just decided to go to Southampton for two years, and see if I could take another step.'\n\nMario Lemina moved to Turkey on loan from Southampton on last day of the transfer window\n\nLemina clearly only saw Southampton as a stepping stone to a big move and forced his way out\n\nDespite being the subject of enquiries from Manchester United, Arsenal and Leicester, Lemina instead switched to Istanbul on the final day of the transfer window, having attempted to force through a move throughout the entire summer.\n\nIn Turkey, the 26-year-old has made four appearances for his new side, and also declared on social media that he was 'in love' with the electric atmosphere at Galatasaray home games.\n\nFlorin Andone\n\nAndone's explosive departure from Brighton has almost certainly burnt the Romanian's bridges with the seaside town and ensured a Premier League return is extremely unlikely.\n\nAfter becoming frustrated with his limited opportunities at the Amex, Andone was loaned out to Galatasaray and revealed that he had been the architect behind the move. He even went as far as blaming former manager Chris Hughton for not playing him enough, and slammed Seagulls striker Glenn Murray whilst questioning why he hadn't been afforded more opportunities to lead the line.\n\nThe 26-year-old had also attempted to downplay the severity of his challenge on Southampton's Yan Valery, which had forced Paul Merson to describe the collision as 'one of the worst tackles you will ever see'.\n\nFlorin Andone has struggled for game time since forcing through a switch from Brighton\n\nAndone left Brighton in a blaze of bad feeling, having made little impact up front in England\n\nWith just four goals to his name in the English top flight, Andone left for Istanbul and is yet to net for his new side, albeit after making just two appearances so far.\n\nBut reports in the Turkish media have claimed that Galatasaray boss Fatih Terim may look to abandon Andone's loan move in January after becoming frustrated with a handful of his summer acquisitions.", "description": "Sportsmail takes a look at Galatasaray's host of ex-Premier League players, including Radamel Falcao and Steven Nzonzi, and gives you the lowdown on their progress since moving to Turkey...", "authors": ["Daniel Davis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/22/19859538-0-image-a-31_1571349102081.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
