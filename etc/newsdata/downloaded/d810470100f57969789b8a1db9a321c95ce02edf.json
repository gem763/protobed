The company was a member of the Y Combinator Winter 2019 cohort.\n\nCEO and co-founder Veronika Riederle says that the fact it\u2019s so closely focused on sales separates it from other more general meeting tools like Zoom, WebEx or GoToMeeting. \u201cWe are building the first intelligent online meeting tool for customer facing conversations. So that is for inside sales and customer service professionals,\u201d Riederle explained.\n\nOne of the key pieces of technology is what Riederle calls, \u201ca unique approach to screen sharing.\u201d Whereas most meeting software involves downloading software to use the tool, Demodesk doesn\u2019t do this. You simply click a link and you\u2019re in. The two parties online are seeing a live screen and each can interact with it. It\u2019s not just a show and tell.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in a sales scenario with a slide presentation, the customer sees the same live screen as the salesperson, but while the salesperson can see their presentation notes, the customer cannot.\n\nShe said while this could work for any number of scenarios from customer service to IT Help desks, at this stage in the company\u2019s development she wants to concentrate on the sales scenario, then expand the vision over time. The service works on a subscription model with tiered-per user pricing starting at $19 per user per month.\n\nWhen they got to Y Combinator, the company already had a working product and paying customers, but Riederle says that the experience has helped them grow the business to over 100 customers. \u201cYC was extremely important for us because we immediately got access to an extremely valuable network of founders and potential customers, and also just a base for us to really [develop] the business.\n\nRiderle founded the company with CTO Alex Popp in 2017 in Munich. Prior to this seed round, the founders mostly bootstrapped the company,. With the $2.3 million it should be able to hire more people and begin building out the product further, while investing in sales and marketing to expand its customer base.", "description": "Demodesk, an early stage startup that wants to change how sales meetings are conducted online, announced a $2.3 million seed investment today.
