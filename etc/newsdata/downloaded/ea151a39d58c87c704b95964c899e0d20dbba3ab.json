Firms: What you Should Know", "language": "en", "text": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 The Chinese high-tech companies blacklisted by Washington over alleged ties to rights abuses are rising stars in China\u2019s ambitious drive to overtake the United States in the technology sector.\n\nThey make surveillance cameras, facial recognition software and other technology that has become ubiquitous in Xinjiang, the heavily policed northwestern region where an estimated one million mostly Muslim minorities, like ethnic Uighurs, are held in internment camps.\n\nThe eight firms were added on Monday to a list of 28 entities that US companies are barred from selling components to without government approval.\n\nHere is a look at the companies targeted:\n\n\u2013 Hikvision \u2013\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of surveillance equipment, Hikvision is the poster child of Chinese tech firms benefiting from Xinjiang\u2019s booming security apparatus.\n\nIn 2017, it won at least five security-related contracts totalling 1.85 billion yuan ($260 million) in Xinjiang \u2014 including a \u201csocial prevention and control system\u201d featuring tens of thousands of cameras.\n\nBut the company also has a global presence, with nearly 30 percent of its revenue last year coming from outside China.\n\nHikvision has said the US listing lacks \u201cfactual basis\u201d, and downplayed its impact in a conference call aimed at investors and media on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the majority of US components can all be directly replaced or replaced with new designs,\u201d said board secretary Huang Fanghong.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s necessary, we will design our own chips.\u201d\n\n-Megvii-\n\nAn AI company backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, Megvii\u2019s facial recognition technology is used across a broad range of applications in China, from \u201csmile to pay\u201d mobile payments to identifying individuals for law enforcement.\n\nThe firm plans to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong but one of its joint sponsors, Goldman Sachs, said it was \u201cevaluating\u201d its role in the wake of the blacklisting.\n\nMegvii said the US move \u201creflects a misunderstanding of our company\u201d.\n\nOnly one percent of its 2018 revenue was from projects in Xinjiang, and no revenue was generated from the region in the first six months of 2019, it added.\n\nIn April, the New York Times reported that several Chinese AI firms, including Megvii, Yitu, and SenseTime, were behind software used to racially profile and track Uighurs.\n\nAccording to media reports, former US vice president and presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who has been accused by President Donald Trump of corruption, is a director at BHR Partners, a fund that invested in Megvii.\n\n\u2013 SenseTime \u2013\n\nSenseTime is backed by an illustrious list of investors, including SoftBank, Alibaba, and US chipmaker Qualcomm.\n\nFounded by MIT alumnus Tang Xiao\u2019ou \u2013- a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong \u2014 the AI company develops facial and image recognition applications, such as crowd monitoring and identity verification for lending apps.\n\nThe firm has a research lab in Silicon Valley and is partnering with universities around the world, including MIT, on AI research.\n\nIn an emailed statement, MIT said it would \u201creview all existing relationships\u201d with organisations added to Washington\u2019s entity list, and \u201cmodify any interactions, as necessary\u201d.\n\nSenseTime said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the blacklisting and would \u201cwork closely with all relevant authorities to fully understand and resolve the situation\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Dahua \u2013\n\nDahua Technology is another leading video surveillance equipment provider with an increasing footprint overseas and has projects in Brazil, Italy, and other countries.\n\nAccording to its 2018 financial report, about 36 percent of the Shenzhen-listed company\u2019s revenue came from abroad.\n\nIn August, the US also formally banned Dahua and Hikvision, along with telecom giant Huawei and other firms, from obtaining government contracts.\n\n\u2013 Meiya Pico \u2013\n\nMeiya Pico, a digital forensics company, drew scrutiny from rights groups after security researchers said the firm was behind \u201cMFSocket\u201d \u2014 an app that enables police to extract contacts, messages, and other personal data from smartphones.\n\n\u2013 Yitu \u2013\n\nYitu Technology has developed apps for facial and speech recognition, such as identity authentication at banks, cancer screening, and monitoring transport hubs to assist law enforcement.\n\n\u2013 iFlytek \u2013\n\nShenzhen-listed AI firm iFlytek is one of the top speech recognition companies in China.\n\nIn 2017, Human Rights Watch said iFlytek was working with China\u2019s public security ministry to collect \u201cvoice pattern\u201d samples and develop a surveillance system that could identify targeted voices in phone conversations.\n\n\u2013 Yixin \u2013\n\nYixin Science and Technology Co. Ltd is a Beijing-based security firm that sells video surveillance, facial recognition, and counter-terrorism products.\n\nDuring the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the company provided wireless surveillance systems at bus stops to monitor for terrorist attacks.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 The Chinese high-tech companies blacklisted by Washington over alleged ties to rights abuses are rising stars in China\u2019s ambitious drive", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/7270c7_china-ai-technology-companies-are-rising-stars-people-faces-scanned-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
