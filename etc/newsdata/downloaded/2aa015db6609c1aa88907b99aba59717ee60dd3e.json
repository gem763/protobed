One was a shoelace \u201cpackaged in a way that someone could perceive them to look similar to a noose.\u201d Another was a lightning cable that broke loose after a tree limb fell on it. The \u201cnooses\u201d found at the University of Delaware after Katie Pavlich\u2019s speech weren\u2019t nooses at all, but actually string and wire hangars for paper lanterns hung from the trees during an earlier event.\n\nBut in this latest case, a 19-year-old allegedly found a piece of rope in a residence hall elevator, tied it into a noose, and was arrested and released on $5,000 bond.\n\nIllinois student charged with hate crime after a noose was found hanging in a dorm elevator. https://t.co/yg6KcB2qc1 \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) September 4, 2019\n\nNBC News (or, more precisely, NBCBLK reports:\n\nA 19-year-old student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been charged with a felony hate crime after a noose was found hanging in a residence hall elevator Sunday. Andrew Smith was arrested at about 9:30 p.m. Monday after he was questioned by authorities at his residence hall on College Court in Urbana, the university police said in a statement. He was charged with committing a hate crime, which is a felony, and a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct. During an arraignment Tuesday afternoon, Champaign County Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Kristin Alferink said Smith found some rope in an elevator in Allen Hall over the weekend and tied it into a noose. About 1 a.m. Sunday, staff at Allen Hall found the noose hanging inside an elevator in a public area of the building. A female friend who was with Smith in the elevator Sunday reported him to authorities, Alferink said. Smith pleaded not guilty Tuesday and was released on a $5,000 bond. He requested a trial by jury.\n\nThat was a felony hate crime?\n\nI have so many questions. \u2014 Kieran Eleison (@KieranEleison) September 4, 2019\n\nWas Jussie Smollett around? \u2014 Cathy Wright (@Oldnblonde) September 4, 2019\n\nCharge with a **felony** for \"hate crime\" for merely tying a noose. \u2014 Alt (@alternativepols) September 4, 2019\n\ntying a knot is a hate crime? \u2014 Frog Capital\ud83c\udf10 (@FrogNews) September 4, 2019\n\nI was gettin anxious for the evening racism headline.
