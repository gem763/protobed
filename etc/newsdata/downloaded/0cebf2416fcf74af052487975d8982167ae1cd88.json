He filmed himself ahead of going to the gym asking Sophie to consider saying yes to George's proposal\n\nHe said: 'She had no idea at all but as so many people knew as they were in the video, I wanted to propose as soon as the video was finished.\n\n'I told her I was at work when I wasn't and made a nice romantic meal. I then fooled her by saying I had a hypnotist video that had worked on a few people. Sophie, being quite competitive, said it wouldn't hypnotise her.\n\n'When I started playing it she looked at me weird and said, \"what is this\", but still did not know what was going on.\n\n'She always said it would take me years to propose so it didn't even cross her mind. It could not have gone any better.'\n\nFormer footballer turned TV presenter Chris Kamara plays a staring role as does American singer-songwriter Ne-Yo, who both sent a message to encourage Sophie to accept the proposal.\n\nGeorge played the part of himself several times over to reenact scenes from US television show Friends\n\nThe carer also took inspiration from Netflix series Peaky Blinders, pretending to shoot a teddy bear and smoke a pipe while wearing a flat cap\n\nGeorge said that he wanted to use the television shows as that's what he and Sophie liked to do on an evening together\n\nSophie's romantic boyfriend spent five months compiling the video which featured clips of their close friends encouraging her to marry George\n\nThe video George has shared is a sped up version of the original because the one Sophie watched had a two minute gap for him to propose.\n\nIt features George in various roles including ones for television shows Friends, Vikings, Peaky Blinders and as a news reader.\n\nHe said: 'I got down on one knee and proposed and she said, \"are you joking?\" and I said, \"no I'm clearly not\". I had been very, very worried and was shaking before I proposed and it was such a relief when she said yes.\n\n'The rest of video was clips sent from her family and friends which we then watched.'\n\nGeorge also played the role of a newsreader where he spoke about random clips of people saying Sophie's name\n\nSophie's friends filmed a clip asking her to marry George which was played after the actual proposal was to take place in the clip\n\nTheir family and friends were all in on the secret video proposal, helping George to create the perfect proposal for his girlfriend\n\nTo add to the video, George secretly filmed her reaction to the video and proposal which will form a unique keepsake for many years to come.\n\nRevealing how he managed to get two celebrities in the video, George said: 'Originally I had the idea of getting Sophie's friends and family involved and then when I met with Luc we bounced ideas off each other.\n\n'I thought that as we like to watch TV programmes together in the evening it would be quite funny to do parody of them and we went to town on it.\n\n'Months ago I looked online how to get to celebrities and emailed so many people. I was very shocked when Chris Kamara and Ne-Yo agreed to be in it. One of the songs Sophie and I sing is Ne-Yo so that made it even more special.\n\n'He asked for an invite to the wedding so I will hold him to it.'\n\nThe couple have been together for two years but previously dated when they were teenagers but had to separate when she moved away to Scotland\n\nChildhood sweethearts George and Sophie have currently been together for two years but first got together when she was 16 and he had just turned 18.\n\nTheir romance ended when Sophie, an insurance salesperson, moved to Scotland - where her mum still lives - and they did not see each other again for six years.\n\nGeorge said: 'I'm quite a believer in that things happen for a reason. Too many things had to fall into place for us to meet again and it was the best thing that has ever happened to me to be honest. When you know you know.\n\n'We are thinking of getting married in to two to three years' time. We both like festivals so want a festival-themed wedding.'\n\nIn the meantime, the couple are busy celebrating their good news with family and friends and are enjoying seeing the reaction the proposal video is getting online.\n\nGeorge said: 'Everyone who has seen the video has said it's amazing. A few people I play football with so they have a lot to live up to.'", "description": "George Minty, 25, spent five months making a proposal video to play to his unsuspecting girlfriend Sophie Norman, 24, both from Devon.
