Kavanaugh more than once in the year since he barely survived a politically motivated, evidence-free smear campaign by liberal activists and Senate Democrats aimed at blocking his elevation to the high court.\n\nBut now, nine Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee may soon provide an answer, of sorts, for Justice Kavanaugh as to where he could go to get his reputation back.\n\nThe nine lawmakers are pressing the Justice Department and the FBI to pursue criminal charges against four people who made false rape and sexual-assault allegations against Justice Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings last year.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh vehemently denied the accusations, and none of them was ever even remotely corroborated. To the contrary, the most high-profile charge \u2014 leveled by his primary accuser, Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 was never corroborated, not even by her longtime friend Leland Keyser. Ms. Keyser refused to change her story despite being pressured by mutual acquaintances of the two women.\n\nMrs. Ford\u2019s credibility was totally shredded after she was unable to support her accusation of a sexual assault at a private party in the early 1980s with even the most basic details of when and where it supposedly happened, or how she got there or got home afterward. Moreover, no one she said was at the same party backed up her claim.\n\nAll but three of the 12 Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee signed a letter sent Oct. 8 to Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray seeking information on the status of the committee\u2019s four referrals for criminal probes, initially submitted a year ago.\n\n\u201cThe Committee referred four individuals to the [Justice Department] and FBI for investigation of potential violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001 (materially false statements) and 1505 (obstruction), for false statements made to the Committee during the course of its investigation,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cIt also referred two of those same individuals for potential violations of 18 U.S.C. 371 (conspiracy). We seek information about what actions [the Justice Department] and FBI are taking in response to these referrals.\u201d\n\nThis pushback by the Judiciary Committee Republicans is as necessary as it is overdue, because as long as there are no legal consequences for making false accusations, liberal activists will continue to employ these hateful, scurrilous tactics.\n\nCharacter assassination is the end justifying the means at its most disgraceful. What\u2019s also disgraceful is that none of the 10 Judiciary Committee Democrats (and the other three Republicans) signed the letter. Their silence equals complicity.\n\n\u201c[W]hen individuals intentionally mislead the Committee, they divert important Committee resources during time-sensitive investigations and materially impede its work,\u201d the Republican senators\u2019 letter says. \u201cSuch acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal.\u201d\n\nCuriously, Mrs. Ford is not among the four referred by the senators for possible criminal prosecution. Two of them are Michael Avenatti, an ambulance-and-TV-camera-chasing lawyer with a long and ugly record of legal misconduct, and a client, Julie Swetnick, who accused Justice Kavanaugh and some friends of \u201ctargeting women with alcohol/drugs in order to allow a \u2018train\u2019 of men to subsequently gang-rape them.\u201d\n\nThe third is Judi Munroe-Leighton, who claimed Justice Kavanaugh and a friend had raped her \u201cseveral times each in the back seat of a car,\u201d but later admitted to having said so \u201cas a way to grab attention\u201d and that she had never even met the judge. The fourth is Jeffrey Catalan, who claimed the nominee had \u201cassaulted a close friend on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1985,\u201d but who later \u201crecanted and apologized on social media for making the false allegation.\u201d\n\nThe senators asked that the Justice Department and FBI respond to their inquiry by Oct. 21. Messrs. Barr and Wray should not continue to stall on decisions about prosecuting this foursome\u2019s falsehoods.\n\nAbsent severe legal consequences, there will continue to be no downside to the far left\u2019s practice of character assassination against conservative judicial nominees and others it opposes politically.\n\nThe legal maxim \u201cJustice delayed is justice denied\u201d even applies to a Supreme Court justice, one who was slimed by leftist ideologues. Justice Kavanaugh deserves to get his good name \u2014 and reputation \u2014 back.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
