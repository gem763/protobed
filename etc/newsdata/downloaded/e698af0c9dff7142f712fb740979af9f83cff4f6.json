Impeachable offenses like \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" are not defined within the document \u2014 leaving them open to legal analysis. House rules regarding impeachment are mostly based on precedence and past impeachment proceedings.\n\nHow an impeachment inquiry starts:\n\nAs a result of various events, including receiving \"information from an outside source,\" congressional investigations, or a House resolution introducing articles of impeachment.\n\nThe House can then begin 3 formal stages of congressional action:\n\nAuthorize an impeachment inquiry by directing the Judiciary Committee to investigate the president. The committee can subpoena people or written records, and conduct hearings. The Judiciary Committee \u2014 or another specially selected committee \u2014 prepares articles of impeachment in a \"markup,\" and reports them to the House. For the past 2 presidential impeachments, the Judiciary Committee held a public, televised markup of the impeachment articles for several days. The full House considers the articles of impeachment and, if they are adopted, appoints managers from the committee to present the articles in the Senate. On the House floor, members are encouraged to abstain from language \"personally offensive\" to the president.\n\nWhat's next: After the Senate receives the House resolution, the Senate informs the House when it can present the articles of impeachment to the Senate \u2014 which is charged in Constitution with trying the president.\n\nYes, but: There is no \"obvious enforcement mechanism\" if the Senate majority leader refuses to hold a trial for a president who has been impeached by the House, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe Senate's impeachment rules of procedure dictate that the Senate will \"immediately inform\" the House that it is ready to receive managers to exhibit articles of impeachment.\n\nThe bottom line: Only 3 presidents have undergone impeachment proceedings. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached in the House and acquitted in the Senate, while Richard Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment.\n\nGo deeper: Impeachment inquiry could be the best way for Democrats to get Trump documents", "description": "House rules on impeachment are mostly based on precedence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/pJSbQzX92G-xH8HxgG6LfrtDeIo=/0x390:4769x3073/1920x1080/2019/09/24/1569363732721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
