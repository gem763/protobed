Bush at 94 years and 172 days old.\n\nIt's been 38 years since Mr. Carter left office, and he's continued to work hard even in his retirement. In 2002, he became the only U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for work done after his time in office.\n\nHe's written over 30 books and served as University Distinguished Professor at Emory University for more than three decades. He finally got tenure at the school at age 94 \u2014 37 years after he began teaching there. Over the years, he's also been a leading force behind Habitat for Humanity, volunteering to build homes for people in need.\n\nMr. Carter has also battled through many health struggles. In 2015, he was diagnosed with melanoma that spread to his brain and liver. \"I was prepared to go, but things turned out for the better,\" he told CBS News, after immunotherapy treatments beat back the cancer.\n\nThe former president also holds another important title: husband. He and his wife Rosalynn Carter have been married for more than 72 years.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Carter broke his hip at his home when he fell while leaving to go turkey hunting. He subsequently had hip replacement surgery. But less than a month later, the tenacious 94-year-old was back to teaching Sunday school.", "description": "The former president, human rights activist and Sunday School teacher is celebrating in a wholesome way \u2013 by dropping the admission to his presidential library to just 95 cents", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/13/ff59117e-b4a3-496c-b99e-214bfaed02e8/thumbnail/1200x630g3/6a8cd93f75cdf4aad2f25b336b4a0289/gettyimages-1043567870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
