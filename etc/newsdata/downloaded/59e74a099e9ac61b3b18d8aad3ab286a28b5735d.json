Charles S. Robb (D).\n\nAD\n\nOne of his signature accomplishments was to open doors in government for women and minorities in the commonwealth, which had been the capital of Confederacy and was often proudly slow to change its ways.\n\nAD\n\nHis lieutenant governor was L. Douglas Wilder, who succeeded Mr. Baliles and became the first African American elected governor of any state. Attorney general Mary Sue Terry, elected with Mr. Baliles and Wilder, was the first woman to hold statewide office in Virginia.\n\nThe three-person Democratic ticket that Mr. Baliles headed in the 1985 election was \u201creally revolutionary\u201d for Virginia, University of Virginia political analyst Larry J. Sabato told The Washington Post at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a Southern state and is one of the most conservative.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs governor, Mr. Baliles appointed the first woman to the Virginia Supreme Court, Elizabeth B. Lacy. He launched an initiative to raise taxes for an ambitious road-building project, primarily in Northern Virginia. He called the legislature into special session and, to the surprise of many, succeeded in getting the bill passed.\n\nAD\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Elijah Cummings, Cokie Roberts, Toni Morrison and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image John Conyers Jr. | John Conyers Jr., who became the longest-serving African American in Congress, co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus and helped create a national holiday in the name of the Rev.

Clifton \u201cChip\u201d Woodrum (D-Roanoke ) said in 1988, \u201cyou learned at that moment that underneath his pinstriped exterior lurks the heart of a riverboat gambler.\u201d\n\nMr. Baliles traveled to more than 20 countries to tout Virginia as a place for international business, and he pushed a $100 million cleanup effort for the Chesapeake Bay, which included a ban on offshore oil drilling.\n\nAD\n\nHe also led efforts to increase spending on day care, preschool programs and Virginia\u2019s colleges. In 1987, he delivered a stern commencement speech at Virginia Tech, then in the midst of an athletic department scandal.\n\n\u201cWe have glimpsed an ominous future, a future few of us ever thought possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a future of misspent financial resources, of million-dollar coaching contracts and lavish expense accounts. It is a future that invites unethical conduct and humiliating publicity. It is a future this institution never dreamt of. It is a future that Virginia Tech does not need.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLongtime football coach and athletic director Bill Dooley was dismissed, and the university\u2019s football and basketball programs were placed on probation by the National Collegiate Athletic Association for two years. Mr. Baliles replaced several member\u2019s of the university\u2019s governing board in an effort to emphasize academics over sports.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Mr. Baliles left office in 1990, prohibited by state law from running for two consecutive terms, Virginia\u2019s financial fortunes had fallen, and budget shortfalls began to doom some of his more ambitious goals.\n\nNonetheless, Wilder predicted that \u201cthe Baliles legacy will be that you don\u2019t talk about what you do, you do it. He\u2019ll go down as perhaps one of the most effective governors we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nGerald Lee Baliles was born July 8, 1940, in Stuart, Va. After his parents separated, he and a brother were raised by their grandparents on a farm in Patrick County, near the North Carolina border.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Baliles graduated from Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Va., then attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in government in 1963. He graduated from the University of Virginia law school in 1967.\n\nAD\n\nThroughout his life, Mr. Baliles had a scholarly mien and, even while campaigning for office, could be seen reading biographies, books on Chinese history or treatises on philosophy.\n\n\u201cI consider Jerry to be the most intelligent officeholder in Virginia,\u201d Sabato said in 1985, before adding, \u201cI think he\u2019s a terrible speechmaker and speechwriter.\u201d\n\nMr. Baliles was a deputy attorney general before being elected in 1975 to the first of three terms in the Virginia House of Delegates. He was elected attorney general in 1981 and resigned in 1985 to focus on his gubernatorial campaign. Considered a long shot at first, he handily defeated Fairfax County Republican Wyatt B. Durrette Jr. in the general election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Baliles\u2019s first marriage, to the former Jeannie Patterson, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife of 16 years, the former Robin Marshall Deal, of Charlottesville, survivors include two children from his first marriage, Jon Baliles, a former Richmond city council member, and Laura Baliles Osberger, both of Richmond; two stepdaughters, Katherine Stone Walsh of Charlottesville and Danielle Deal Hudak of Ashland, Va.; and four granddaughters.\n\nMr. Baliles was under consideration as a possible U.S. attorney general in the administration of President Bill Clinton, but he kept a low profile after leaving the Virginia governor\u2019s mansion. He was a partner at the Hunton & Williams law firm in Richmond, and served on educational and environmental task forces. He was director of the Miller Center, a University of Virginia research institute on politics and public policy, from 2006 to 2014 .\n\nMr. Baliles \u201clifted Virginia\u2019s profile nationally, and helped Virginians see themselves differently,\u201d Terry, the Commonwealth\u2019s first female attorney general, said in 1988. \u201cJerry then flipped the state\u2019s image, from the Old Dominion to the New.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "After winning Virginia\u2019s top office in 1985, he emphasized increased funding for transportation, education and the environment.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tbE4hdG9Zl7WQDSjaPuw4Gg118c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZHSQXCHBFQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
