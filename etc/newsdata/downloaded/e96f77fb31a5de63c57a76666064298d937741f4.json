REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis\n\nLebanese lenders remained closed for a seventh working day on Friday, with the small, heavily indebted Mediterranean country paralysed as hundreds of thousands of people protest over economic strife, leaving schools and businesses shut.\n\nThe government has responded by promising reforms which involve banks stumping up 5.1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($3.4 billion) towards deficit reduction in next year\u2019s budget, partly through a rise in tax on their profits.\n\n\u201cThese measures should weaken the banking sector as they will cut into their profit margins over the next year,\u201d said Natasha Smirnova, portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, pointing out the levy was just a one off for next year.\n\nFinancial services make up 8% of gross domestic product in the country of 6 million. Bank deposits to GDP stand at 243%, the third highest ratio globally after Luxembourg and Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cBanks have an enormous role in government funding, as they are almost their only source of financing, and the cabinet/ central bank will proceed with utmost caution so they do not hurt the sector too much,\u201d Smirnova added.\n\nLebanon\u2019s unorthodox \u201cfinancial engineering\u201d relies on them drawing in FX deposits from abroad by offering high interest rates to help shore up the country\u2019s pressurised FX reserves.\n\nLebanon has 66 registered lenders, with commercial banks holding just over $260 billion of assets, central bank data showed, though a handful of large players dominate.\n\nBut while banks in Lebanon have an unusually wide geographic spread due to its estimated diaspora of around 14 million, their closure so far appears to pose relatively little threat to wider financial stability.\n\nThe Lebanese have a long history of emigration and settling around the world, with large, mostly Christian, expatriate populations in Brazil and the United States in addition to Shi\u2019ite communities in Africa.\n\n\u201cLebanese banks have significant operations in the region, but this is mainly through a subsidiary model, where those operations are ring-fenced,\u201d said Farouk Soussa, senior economist with Goldman Sachs. \u201cThis minimises the risk of financial contagion either way.\u201d\n\nBank Audi (AUDI.BY) (AUSRq.L) - Lebanon\u2019s biggest bank by assets - operates in 11 countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, France and Switzerland. Its annual report showed that of its total assets of $47.2 billion, nearly 70% came from Lebanon at the end of 2018 compared to just over 60% the previous year.\n\nIts Turkish arm Bank Odea, in which Bank Audi holds a 75% stake, accounted for nearly 13% of assets while Egypt accounted for 8.2%. However, the share of both countries in total assets had declined due to currency depreciation.\n\n\u201cBank Audi\u2019s branches and subsidiaries abroad are stand alone entities and are therefore not affected by the crisis Lebanon is currently witnessing,\u201d it said on Friday in response to questions from Reuters.\n\nBlom Bank (BLOM.BY) operates in around 10 countries including Britain and Romania. But of the bank\u2019s $36.7 billion of assets at the end of 2018, nearly 83% came from Lebanon, with another 9% from MENA, including Egypt, Jordan and Iraq.\n\nAsked what effect the crisis in Lebanon was having on its branches and subsidiaries abroad, Blom Bank said it had \u201cwitnessed an increase in its foreign operations\u201d, without giving any further details.\n\nBank of Beirut (BOB.BY) in 2011 bought Australia\u2019s Bank of Sydney, which offers mortgages, home loans and savings accounts and states on its website that deposits were covered by the Australian Government Deposit Guarantee.\n\nSalim Sfeir, chairman of Bank of Beirut and the Association of Banks in Lebanon said he expected banking operations will fully resume once banks re-opened. Bank Audi said it was servicing and replenishing ATMs, collecting cheques deposited at smart ATMs and \u201cprocessing emergency requests\u201d.\n\nWHENEVER, WHEREVER\n\nMany of Lebanon\u2019s lenders focus on banking expatriates rather than being systematically entangled in the financial ecosystems of other nations.\n\nThe other factor limiting the potential repercussions of the stresses in the Lebanese banking system is that many western banks have limited exposure to the country, which was shattered by civil war between 1975 and 1990.\n\nIt now faces sluggish growth and high unemployment.\n\n\u201cIt might make you think of Ireland where banking sector stress will completely bring down the whole economy,\u201d said Nafez Zouk at Oxford Economics.\n\n\u201cBut Lebanon\u2019s banking sector is pretty plain vanilla - it is not risky, there is lot of macro-prudential regulation...it\u2019s very, very pure and simple banking.\u201d\n\nOf the major western banks, Citigroup (C.N) remains one of the few with a presence, with 35 staff offering corporate and investment banking as well as trade finance, the U.S. bank\u2019s website shows.\n\nJPMorgan has just a handful of people based in Lebanon, who work in Treasury Services, which is part of wholesale payments.\n\nOthers have withdrawn altogether.\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L) sold its Lebanon subsidiary to Blom Bank some two years ago, while banks from other Arab countries have also dialled down their activities.\n\nSome are pointing to cooling relations between Beirut and some of its historic allies such as Saudi Arabia over Hezbollah and the group\u2019s growing influence in Lebanon\u2019s government.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s largest lender, National Commercial Bank (1180.SE), closed its two branches in Lebanon in 2016.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nQatar National Bank (QNBK.QA), the largest bank in the Middle East, still has operations in Lebanon, yet a spokesman said on the ground it has just one branch with limited business.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Lebanon is idiosyncratic and unlikely to have any contagion on emerging markets as we have seen historically with political developments there,\u201d PineBridge\u2019s Smirnova said.\n\n($1 = 1,505.7000 Lebanese pounds)", "description": "Lebanon's economic crisis is a litmus test for the resilience and domestic support of its banks as well as their potential for sparking contagion abroad.", "authors": ["Karin Strohecker", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444887506&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O12N", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
