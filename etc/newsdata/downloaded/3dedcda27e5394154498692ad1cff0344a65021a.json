Samsung\u2019s third financial quarter ended on September 30th.\n\nBack in April Samsung CEO Hyun-suk Kim (who runs the company\u2019s consumer electronics division) told The Korea Herald that the speaker was planned for launch in the \u201cmid-second half of the year.\u201d According to other Samsung executives, this launch window was widely interpreted to mean it would launch in the third quarter of the year.\n\nThis is just one of the many release dates that the Galaxy Home, which was first announced back in August 2018, has failed to hit. In February the company said the speaker would launch in April, but after it failed to appear the company then said the speaker was still planned for release \u201cin the first half of 2019.\u201d\n\nRelated The Galaxy Home looks like everything but a speaker\n\nThe situation was further complicated at the end of August when Samsung quietly announced a second Galaxy Home speaker called the Galaxy Home Mini, and invited Galaxy smartphone owners in South Korea to sign up to beta test the new smart speaker. At the time, it made no reference to its original smart speaker.\n\nSamsung did not respond to a request for comment on the current status of the Galaxy Home. The most recent comment from the company was back in August, after the speaker failed to make an appearance at Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 10 launch. At the time the company said that it was \u201ccontinuing to refine and enhance the Galaxy Home prior to launch, and look forward to sharing more with Galaxy fans soon.\u201d", "description": "The Samsung Galaxy Home did not ship in Q3 of this year, the most recent launch window that the company announced for the smart speaker.
