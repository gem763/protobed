While South Korea and India have halted purchases, customs data show that China is still regularly taking crude from the Persian Gulf nation, albeit at much smaller quantities.\n\n\u201cMaximum pressure is our policy and our policy is to bring Iranian oil exports to zero,\u201d Donnelly said in an interview in Singapore. \u201cSanctions are biting.\u201d\n\nIran has continued to transport oil to customers despite U.S. sanctions, utilizing a fleet of tankers consisting of ships owned by the Persian Gulf nation and other entities. The U.S. recently slapped penalties on companies that continue to facilitate this flow, imposing trade restrictions on Chinese oil-importers and shippers such as Zhuhai Zhenrong Co. and a unit of COSCO Shipping Corp.\n\nSee also: Millions of Barrels of Iran Oil Are Sitting in China\u2019s Ports\n\nVessels can avoid detection by employing tactics that include vanishing from tracking screens and clandestine transfers on the high seas in order to hide their activities. Chinese imports from ship-to-ship transfers surged last month to about 910,000 tons of crude, three times as much as in August, although it\u2019s unclear where the oil originated.\n\nAmple Supplies\n\nGlobal markets remain well supplied, despite sanctions on Iran, restrictions on U.S. trades with Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA, and a recent attack on Saudi oil facilities, Donnelly said.\n\n\u201cLooking at the global oil market, there hasn\u2019t been shortages even when we had the attack on Saudi facilities,\u201d said Donnelly. While sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have taken some supplies off the market, the U.S. has so much capacity that it can fill some of those supply gaps. The reduction of supplies \u201chasn\u2019t disrupted oil markets, oil prices aren\u2019t skyrocketing,\u201d he added.\n\nLast month, about half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s output was hit by one of the worst disruptions in history, although production was fully restored within two weeks of the incident. In the weeks following the attack, exports of expanded to just shy of the nation\u2019s highest-ever record outflows of oil set in June this year.", "description": "U.S. Keeping Eye on Iran Oil Buyers as Sanctions Squeeze Flows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic2f0e30358aa0cfe19009b1dc313a8ba3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
