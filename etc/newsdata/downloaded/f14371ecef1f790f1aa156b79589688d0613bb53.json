Paramedics stabilised her at the scene, but she died the next morning at Wagga Wagga Base Hospital.\n\nRiverina district police have established a taskforce \u2013 Strike Force Lamson \u2013 to investigate Bruno\u2019s death.\n\nA 31-year-old Wagga Wagga man was arrested on Sunday afternoon. He was charged with manslaughter and bailed to appear in Wagga Wagga local court on 6 November.\n\nBruno\u2019s brother, Leonel Bruno, told Rappler by phone his family was pleading with the Philippines authorities to assist with repatriating his sister\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cOur call is for the government to help bring our sister home. I hope they can help us. There is no one handling our case. We were already expecting her to come home, but this happened.\u201d\n\nTransgender people suffer grossly disproportionate levels of interpersonal violence, and are regularly subjected to hate crimes, media representative for Transgender Victoria, Sally Goldner, told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThe statistics that have come out repeatedly show that transgender and gender diverse people experience physical assault or threat of physical assault at a rate of 25%. That\u2019s compared to 2% for the general population, so 12 times the rate. When it comes to people who don\u2019t fit expectations of how someone is supposed to look in relation to gender, it gets even worse, up to 50%.\u201d\n\nGoldner said that the continued disproportionate level of transgender violence was driven by \u201cthe fact there are still too many people who think it\u2019s OK to ridicule, vilify, and incite hatred against transgender and gender diverse people\u201d.\n\n\u201cViolence doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere, it comes out of these discriminatory attitudes.\u201d\n\nAnd Goldner said statistics, particularly those emerging out of the US, show transgender people of colour face additional discrimination and even higher levels of violence.\n\n\u201cSome people face, if you like, double discrimination, even triple discrimination, simply because of who they are. We must treat all people with respect.\u201d\n\n'It\u2019s like we\u2019re not even human': the reality of being a trans black woman in America Read more\n\nEighteen transgender people have been killed in the US this year, according to the the Human Rights Campaign.
