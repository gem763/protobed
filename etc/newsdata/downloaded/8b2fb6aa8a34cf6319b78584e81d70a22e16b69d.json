Private Data Show a Sharper Slowdown.", "language": "en", "text": "A photo of China from space. San Francisco-based SpaceKnow uses satellite images to gauge how China\u2019s industrial hubs are performing.\n\nIn the second quarter of this year, official Chinese data showed economic growth of 6.2%, close to Beijing\u2019s target and within a percentage point of what it has reported every quarter for the past 4\u00bd years.\n\nA few months earlier, satellites monitoring Chinese industrial hubs suggested parts of the world\u2019s largest trading economy were contracting. An index of Chinese industrial production created by a multinational manufacturer was pointing to lower growth than official figures. And a web-search index used to gauge how many workers return to their jobs after the Lunar New Year holidays was down sharply from a year earlier.\n\nBeneath China\u2019s stable headline economic numbers, there is a growing belief among economists, companies and investors around the world that the real picture is worse than the official data. That has analysts and researchers crunching an array of alternative data\u2014from energy consumption to photos taken from space\u2014for a more accurate reading.\n\nTheir conclusion: China\u2019s economy isn\u2019t tanking, but it is almost certainly weaker than advertised. Some economists who have dissected China\u2019s GDP numbers say more accurate figures could be up to 3 percentage points lower, based on their analysis of corporate profits, tax revenue, rail freight, property sales and other measures of activity that they believe are harder for the government to fudge.\n\nChina, whose GDP topped $13 trillion last year, is still growing, and the alternative data points to that. It indicates the deceleration is happening in areas such as manufacturing. In many cases, alternative indicators have previewed the path of official data and show the depth of the challenges Chinese authorities face.\n\nSeeing is Believing China's reported GDP growth has been close to official targets in recent years, while an alternative measure of economic activity shows a lower reading. 15 % GDP growth, official series GDP growth, State Council target Capital Economics China Activity Proxy 10 5 0 2009 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u201919 15 % GDP growth, official series GDP growth, State Council target Capital Economics China Activity Proxy 10 5 0 2009 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u201919 15 % GDP growth, official series GDP growth, State Council target Capital Economics China Activity Proxy 10 5 0 2009 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u201919 15 % GDP growth, official series GDP growth, State Council target Capital Economics China Activity Proxy 10 5 0 2009 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u201919\n\n\u201cManufacturing is being hit really hard,\u201d said Leland Miller, chief executive officer of China Beige Book, which measures China\u2019s economic strength based on thousands of survey responses from mainland companies. \u201cInvestment is down, hiring took a serious hit, a huge hit to new orders.\u201d\n\nChina on Friday released billions of dollars to banks in an effort to revive business sentiment as the U.S.-China trade battle continues. The People\u2019s Bank of China reduced the amount of money commercial banks have to hold in reserve, enabling lenders to finance projects.\n\nMuch of the data \u201cis telling us nothing good about the China economy,\u201d said Eric Pratt, head of global marketing at AVX Corp. , a maker of electronic components based in Fountain Inn, S.C., which has two Chinese factories producing parts for cars and mobile phones. Mr. Pratt said over the past year, as alternative indicators and forecasts pointed to more weakness, his company cut some jobs and slowed production.\n\nOver the past decade, China\u2019s growth has made up between a quarter and a third of the world\u2019s economic expansion. The country\u2019s size and interconnectedness around the globe now means small changes in output impact the performance of all major economies, including the U.S. and trade-oriented ones such as Germany and Japan.\n\nSince the escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict, suspicion that China may be massaging its official data to paint a picture of broad economic health has become a challenge for Washington. U.S. trade negotiators have been seizing on any signs of weakness in their attempt to squeeze more concessions from Beijing.\n\nAs the effects of tit-for-tat tariffs filter into China\u2019s economy, the country\u2019s government has also tightened access to data that has proved reliable in the past, in some cases stopping the release of indicators that paint an unfavorable picture.\n\nIn December, a manufacturing index for the trade-intensive Guangdong province was suspended after trailing national figures for months. The country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said the local government that produced the index didn\u2019t have permission to do it.\n\nJob Stability China\u2019s official unemployment figures haven't changed much since the trade war began, raising questions about their reliability. 6.0 % Surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas 5.5 5.0 4.5 The registered urban unemployment rate 4.0 3.5 3.0 2018 \u201919\n\nOne challenge for businesses and investors is that China\u2019s economy can\u2019t be easily deciphered using measures such as unemployment and real GDP growth because those numbers don\u2019t change much or are carefully managed. Where China\u2019s central bank sets interest rates also isn\u2019t a good gauge of growth, because most large Chinese banks are state-owned entities whose lending is driven by policy goals rather than profit motives.\n\nOne official measure of China\u2019s unemployment rate has hovered between 3.5% and 4.5% for the last 15 years, a pattern that has led many economists to conclude it is unreliable. About two years ago, China began publishing an unemployment rate for urban areas derived from a labor survey that authorities said was more accurate. It recently showed a higher reading of 5.3%, but has also moved in a fairly tight range.\n\nAuthorities have defended their data. Earlier this year, after China reported stronger-than-expected GDP growth, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said the state wasn\u2019t ironing out economic fluctuations. In August, another representative of the body said its survey of the country\u2019s labor force was relatively reliable, scientific and accurate.\n\nGenerally speaking China\u2019s data has captured some degree of slowdown, though sometimes later than private measures. But government efforts to keep the economy from cratering, such as infrastructure spending, lending and other stimulus, can obscure areas of weakness or smooth headline growth numbers. As a result, they often don\u2019t capture what companies are seeing on the ground, independent economists say.\n\nThat has left the door open for dozens of proprietary data providers who are competing for a growing field of financial and multinational clients, global central banks and government agencies around the world. They face a challenging task given China\u2019s vast and diverse economy where labor conditions, incomes and business activity levels vary widely between modern cities, manufacturing hubs and swaths of rural areas.\n\nChanges in China\u2019s economic output affect all major economies.

American apparel company Brooks Brothers Group Inc. is expanding in China, but after detecting weaker retail sentiment in conversations with mall operators and in customer traffic and tourist numbers, the chain is in some cases setting up shop in smaller spaces instead of larger stores.\n\n\u201cThere has been some softening,\u201d said Andy Lew, president of Brooks Brothers\u2019 international division.\n\nLondon-based research firm Capital Economics has its own gauge of Chinese economic growth constructed from measures such as the amount of property floor space under construction, electricity output, freight and passenger traffic, and seaport volumes. \u201cThe problem is not a lack of data but more the quality,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, its Singapore-based senior China economist.\n\nThe firm\u2019s index, called the China Activity Proxy, has shown growth below official figures for the past seven years. It recently indicated an expansion rate of around 5.7% due in part to stronger construction activity. But electricity production\u2014a proxy for heavy industry\u2014has slumped and credit growth remains weak, supporting the idea that parts of the economy aren\u2019t doing well.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you think China\u2019s economy is faring worse than it looks? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn July, China reported 4.8% year-over-year growth in industrial output, its slowest pace in 17 years. A large multinational company had seen the signs much earlier.\n\nEaton Corp. , a global manufacturer of electrical components and power systems for buildings, industrial facilities, planes and other machinery, has about $2 billion sales in China. Last year, its in-house index showed 2.7% industrial production growth while China\u2019s official reading was above 5% over the course of 2018. The company\u2019s index estimated 2.5% growth for the first half of 2019.\n\nThe index was constructed by a team of in-house economists about a decade ago, when Eaton noticed demand in its markets was weaker than Beijing\u2019s growth numbers, said its former chief economist Jim Meil. The index was built from Chinese data combed from domestic sources that included automotive sales, steel production and construction activity, Mr. Meil said.\n\nAnalysts and researchers look at alternative data to track China\u2019s economy. Photo: jason lee/Reuters\n\nIn late 2018, months before China\u2019s purchasing manufacturing index pointed to a contraction, satellites operated by SpaceKnow, a San Francisco-based research company, detected a significant slowdown in industrial activity.\n\nSpaceKnow tracks about 6,000 industrial locations in China and analyzes data on night-light luminosity and infrared bands\u2014indicators of heat produced by electricity or factories\u2014from about half those sites roughly every two weeks. It produces a proprietary index that has become a leading Chinese PMI indicator used by hedge funds, central banks and policy makers, said CEO Jeremy Fand.\n\n\u201cYou can see factories suddenly go quiet, giant subdivisions, huge construction projects just get halted,\u201d said Mr. Fand. In August, SpaceKnow\u2019s index pointed to a slight expansion, coming close to official figures that analysts said reflected a pickup in production before more U.S. tariffs came into effect.\n\nMr. Fand said the company is also working on a project for a U.S. government agency that is trying to analyze the impact of U.S. tariffs on China\u2019s economy and certain industries.\n\nLast December, U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq Inc. bought an alternative-data business called Quandl Inc. Bill Dague, a data scientist leading alternative research at Quandl, has traveled to China in recent months to hunt for new data sets for clients.\n\n\u201cBecause it is so hard to get data out of China, demand has surpassed supply,\u201d he said, adding that escalating U.S.-China tensions have made domestic data vendors less willing to share information with U.S. companies.\n\nQuandl\u2019s data includes satellite images of aluminum stockpiles and containers of concentrate sitting outside Chinese smelters and storage facilities before and after the U.S. imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese aluminum in March 2018.\n\nSatellite images of metal stocks outside an aluminum smelter in Inner Mongolia from February 2018, above, and June 2018, below. Photo: RS Metrics/Quandl\n\nPhoto: RS Metrics/Quandl\n\nBefore the duties took effect, geospatial images indicated factories were ramping up aluminum production. By the summer of that year, the stockpiles had run down and the production supplies weren\u2019t replenished at many smelters, indicating slower production and slackening demand weeks before it was reflected in Chinese government data.\n\nGeorge Mussalli, who oversees research and investments at Boston-based PanAgora Asset Management Inc., said one metric he monitors yearly is a \u201cSpring Festival Index\u201d produced by Chinese web-search giant Baidu Inc. PanAgora is a quantitative investment fund that uses data, mathematical and computer models to develop trading strategies.\n\nBaidu\u2019s index is compiled from the number of people who use its search engine to find information about travel and transportation options around the weeklong festival, which coincides with Lunar New Year. During that period, millions of workers embark on long commutes from big industrial cities to rural areas in central China to spend the holiday with their families.\n\nOne index showed a drop in the number of people searching about travel for a weeklong spring festival this year. Photo: Su Yang/SIPA Asia/Zuma Press\n\nThis year\u2019s festival took place in early February, and the index showed a 12% drop in the number of people searching about travel in contrast to the previous year. Mr. Mussalli said the lower reading was a sign of slower economic activity.\n\n\u201cIn years where factories expect less production, some of the workers go home and stay home,\u201d Mr. Mussalli said.\n\nChina\u2019s automotive sector, which makes up about a 10th of GDP, has been in a slump since late 2018. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the organization that puts out official sales numbers and forecasts, had earlier estimated that 2019 sales would be flat year on year. In the first seven months of the year, they fell 12.8%. Despite that, the official forecast is now for a 5.4% full-year decline.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch are less optimistic. They forecast a 3.6% drop in car sales at the start of 2019 and now expect a 12% drop for the year.\n\nMing Hsun Lee, a Hong Kong-based autos analyst at the bank, has been using data from a domestic vendor that collects weekly numbers from companies on production levels, sales to dealers and retail car sales. He said he uses it to calculate inventory levels at manufacturers, and considers price discounts, government stimulus and other factors in developing his forecast.\n\nMr. Pratt at AVX, the U.S. electronics component maker, said the company has been using the bank\u2019s data to help gauge demand and adjust production. \u201cWe don\u2019t use what the government says because they are always really protective of their automotive industry,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014Zhou Wei in Shanghai and Serena Ng in Hong Kong contributed to this article.", "description": "Beneath China\u2019s stable headline numbers, there is a growing belief the real picture is worse.
