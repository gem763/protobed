Other data showed an unexpected decline in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week. Layoffs remained low even as companies were becoming hesitant to hire more workers because of a slowing economy.\n\nThe strong labor market helps explain why Treasury yields did not fall on the news of tepid inflation. Across maturities, yields rose in morning trade. The benchmark 10-year yield was up 6.4 basis points to 1.649%, with the two-year yield, a proxy for investor expectations of interest-rate moves, up 4.6 basis points to 1.520%.\n\nPredictions that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its October meeting were 77.5% on Thursday morning, slightly lower than the 80.2% on Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nLater on Thursday, $16 billion of 30-year bonds will be reopened by the Treasury Department, the end of a week of heavy supply totaling $78 billion in notes and bonds. Ahead of the auction, 30-year yields were up 6.4 basis points to 2.150%.
