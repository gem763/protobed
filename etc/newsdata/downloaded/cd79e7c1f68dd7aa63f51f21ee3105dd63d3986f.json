And Mercedes are desperate to keep hold of him even it means granting a significant rise on his current \u00a340million-a-year salary.\n\nHis contract runs until the end of next season, as do those of the other top drivers. They are all unwilling to rush into committing their futures beyond then with new regulations due in 2021.\n\nBut Mercedes boss Toto Wolff revealed: \u2018Discussions with Lewis have slowly but surely started.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t see this coming to any sort of closure in terms of the 2021 driver line-up any time soon. It will go into next season.\u2019\n\nMercedes boss Toto Wolff wants to help Hamilton write the most successful story in F1 history\n\nFerrari are a potential rival suitor. Hamilton sounded them out before signing his current deal and has long understood the allure of the famous red cars.\n\nBut in recent weeks he has spoken of his deep sense of loyalty to Mercedes \u2013 while the emergence of Charles Leclerc as the Scuderia\u2019s new young hope may anyway preclude Hamilton from a romantic coda to his glittering career.\n\nThere is also the question of age. By the start of the 2021 season, Hamilton will be 36, only a year younger than Schumacher when he drove a Ferrari for the last time in Brazil in 2006.\n\nIt is questionable whether the Italian team would want to begin a relationship with even a superstar driver at such an advanced stage.\n\n\u2018This Ferrari thing has maybe been blown out of proportion,\u2019 said Wolff. \u2018Lewis has a clear opinion where he sees himself in the future and we have always been very loyal to our drivers.\n\n\u2018But with 2021 everything is different and drivers and teams will be evaluating the options that are on the table. At the end of the day the car\u2019s performance is what counts most for the top guys.\u2019\n\nFerrari are a potential rival suitor. Hamilton sounded them out before signing his current deal\n\nHamilton has shunted talk over his future to the back of his mind while he tries to win the title before the circus heads to Austin for the US Grand Prix. One destabilising factor is the absence on Sunday and next week of the Briton\u2019s race engineer Peter Bonnington.\n\nEver present over the last 136 races, \u2018Bono\u2019 is back in Britain receiving medical treatment. His place is being taken by Marcus Dudley, who moves up one notch from his position as performance engineer.\n\nHamilton has secured the title here in the past two seasons but has not finished higher than fourth on either occasion.\n\nOn Sunday, he must make it on to the podium today to have any chance of extinguishing Bottas\u2019s mathematical involvement in what can only loosely be called a contest.\n\nFerrari are to blame for the lack of competition, having only found form belatedly since the summer break.\n\nHamilton has won just then, in Russia. Wolff said: \u2018Ferrari have become the benchmark so I wouldn\u2019t put any lack of recent success down to Lewis as a driver.\n\n\u2018He is still in a good place.\u2019", "description": "JONATHAN McEVOY IN MEXICO CITY: Mercedes have opened contract talks with Lewis Hamilton in an attempt to help him write the most successful story in Formula One history.", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcevoy For Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20226538-0-image-a-40_1572124415521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
