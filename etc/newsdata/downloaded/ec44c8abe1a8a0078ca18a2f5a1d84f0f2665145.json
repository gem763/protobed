The qubits in Sycamore are laid out in a roughly rectangular grid, with each qubit able to interact with its neighbors. Control signals, sent by wire from classical computers outside the dilution refrigerator, tell each qubit how to behave, including which of its neighbors to interact with and when.\n\nIn other words, the device is fully programmable \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a \u201ccomputer.\u201d At the end , the qubits are all measured, yielding a random string of 53 bits. Whatever sequence of interactions was used to produce that string \u2014 in the case of Google\u2019s experiment, the interactions were simply picked at random \u2014 you can then rerun the exact same sequence again, to sample another random 53-bit string in exactly the same way, and so on as often as desired.\n\nIn its Nature paper, Google estimated that its sampling calculation \u2014 the one that takes 3 minutes and 20 seconds on Sycamore \u2014 would take 10,000 years for 100,000 conventional computers , running the fastest algorithms currently known. Indeed the task was so hard, Google said, that even directly verifying the full range of the results on classical computers was out of reach for its team. Thus, to check the quantum computer\u2019s work in the hardest cases, Google relied on plausible extrapolations from easier cases.\n\nIBM, which has built its own 53-qubit processor, posted a rebuttal. The company estimated that it could simulate Google\u2019s device in a mere 2.5 days, a millionfold improvement over Google\u2019s 10,000 years. To do so, it said, it would only need to commandeer the Oak Ridge Summit, the largest supercomputer that currently exists on earth \u2014 which IBM installed last year at Oak Ridge National Laboratory , filling an area the size of two basketball courts. (And which Google used for some of its simulations in verifying the Sycamore results.) Using this supercomputer\u2019s eye-popping 250 petabytes of hard disk space , IBM says it could explicitly write down all 9 quadrillion of the amplitudes. Tellingly, not even IBM thinks the simulation would be especially easy \u2014 nor, as of this writing, has IBM actually carried it out. ( The Oak Ridge supercomputer isn\u2019t just sitting around waiting for jobs .)\n\nWe\u2019re now in an era where, with heroic effort, the biggest supercomputers on earth can still maybe, almost simulate quantum computers doing their thing. But the very fact that the race is close today suggests that it won\u2019t remain close for long. If Google\u2019s chip had used 60 qubits rather than 53, then simulating it s results with IBM\u2019s approach would require 30 Oak Ridge supercomputers. With 70 qubits, it would require enough supercomputers to fill a city. And so on.\n\nIs there real science behind the spectacle of these two tech titans locking antlers? Is \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d divorced from practical applications, an important milestone at all? When should we expect those practical applications, anyway? Assuming Google has achieved quantum supremacy, what exactly has it proved \u2014 and is it something anyone doubted in the first place?\n\nLet\u2019s start with applications. A protocol that I came up with a couple years ago uses a sampling process, just like in Google\u2019s quantum supremacy experiment, to generate random bits. While by itself that\u2019s unimpressive, the key is that these bits can be demonstrated to be random even to a faraway skeptic, by using the telltale biases that come from quantum interference. Trusted random bits are needed for various cryptographic applications, such as proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies (environmentally friendlier alternatives to Bitcoin). Google is now working toward demonstrating my protocol; it bought the non-exclusive intellectual property rights last year.", "description": "The company says its quantum computer can complete a calculation much faster than a supercomputer.
