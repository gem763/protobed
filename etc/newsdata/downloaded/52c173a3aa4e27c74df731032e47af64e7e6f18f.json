It also cited weakened consumer spending after two straight years of population declines and concerns about U.S. and global economies will further weigh on growth.\n\nThese factors prompted UHERO to darken its outlook compared to its prior forecast in May. It now expects weaker results for jobs, personal income and visitor arrivals.\n\nEconomists expect a 1.2% statewide decline in the number of visitors to Hawaii next year and a 0.1% drop in 2021.\n\nInternational travelers are expected to reduce their travel and spending because of a weaker global economy and a stronger dollar, which makes a Hawaii vacation more expensive, the report said.\n\nUHERO said international visitor spending in Hawaii, when adjusted for inflation, is down about 9% this year.\n\nHawaii residents are also depressing growth by moving away.\n\nThe report said the local population fell in each of the last two years, which cuts into consumer spending. UHERO said the last time there were two consecutive years of population loss in Hawaii was during the 1950s.\n\nOne strong area is the construction industry. The organization expects \u201cmodest\u201d growth in construction over the next several years.\n\nHawaii\u2019s unemployment rate is predicted to rise to 3.2% next year from 2.8% this year.\n\nUnemployment around 3% is still considered roughly full employment, so employers will still be pressed to find good workers and be competitive with pay.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hawaii's economy will likely slow to a near standstill in coming years, according to a new report published Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
