(AP) \u2014 Best-selling country duo of all time Brooks & Dunn, comedian and singer Ray Stevens and record executive Jerry Bradley joined the Country Music Hall of Fame in a star-filled ceremony on Sunday evening that was full of tributes to their hit songs and their lasting legacies in country music.\n\nReba McEntire, Luke Bryan, Trisha Yearwood, Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart and Travis Tritt were among the guest performers during the medallion ceremony in Nashville, Tennessee at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. Each inductee received a medallion and a plaque that will be placed inside the Hall of Fame rotunda.\n\nBrooks & Dunn were an unlikely pairing of two artists who both started out solo. Neither Kix Brooks nor Ronnie Dunn thought the partnership would last, but decades later they are the most awarded and best-selling country duo of all time, with 19 CMA Awards, two Grammys and 25 Academy of Country Music Awards and 20 No. 1 hits. Brooks\u2019 flamboyant nature and guitar playing brought the perfect counterpoint to Dunn\u2019s stellar singing, but more understated personality.\n\nWith hits such as \u201cBrand New Man,\u201d \u201dBoot Scootin\u2019 Boogie,\u201d \u201dMy Maria,\u201d \u201dNeon Moon,\u201d the pair filled arenas and sold more than 28 million albums in the U.S. alone. They took a break in 2010, but nearly a decade later, they reunited in the studio to release new duet versions of their hits with today\u2019s country stars in an album called \u201cReboot.\u201d\n\nReba McEntire, who has been playing alongside Brooks & Dunn since the \u201990s and has an ongoing longstanding Las Vegas residency with the duo for several years, came to put the medallions over their heads and joked that she considered them her \u201cbig brothers.\u201d\n\nBrooks has often said he never understood why they made such a good pair, but it happened immediately.\n\n\u201cPutting the two of us together on a Tuesday, and us writing our first two No. 1 records on a Thursday and Friday is just weird,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nDunn acknowledged that he was often over-analytical of himself and noted that even his therapist was in attendance that night. But he said that he tried hard to keep himself from getting too emotional.\n\n\u201cI have never been so proud and humble,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cReboot\u201d album and the induction has put them back in the spotlight again and they are nominated for two CMA awards for duo of the year and musical event at the CMA Awards in November.\n\n\u201cWe had every intention of quitting, and we did for a few minutes,\u201d Brooks said, \u201cBut I think we realize now how lucky we are.\u201d\n\nComedian and country singer Ray Stevens, who learned to play piano as a child in Clarkdale, Georgia, is known for his novelty songs like \u201cThe Streak\u201d and \u201cAhab the Arab,\u201d but also the earnest and Grammy-winning \u201cEverything is Beautiful.\u201d He is an all-around entertainer, who worked as a TV personality, producer, a session musician and a songwriter. He currently still performs at his own dinner theater in Nashville called CabaRay.\n\nRicky Skaggs performed the jazz standard \u201cMisty,\u201d which Stevens rearranged into a country bluegrass version that became his biggest country hit in 1975 and earned him a Grammy for arrangement. The McCrary Sisters performed a gospel version of \u201cEverything is Beautiful,\u201d which brought tears to Stevens, who was seated in the front row.\n\nStevens, 80, said that since his induction was announced earlier this year, he said people had been saying it was about time he was honored.\n\n\u201cAnytime is a good time to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d he said. But he joked that if the induction had come sooner, he \u201ccould have upped his booking fees.\u201d\n\nJerry Bradley came from a legacy of Country Music Hall of Fame inductees, including his father, producer Owen Bradley, the architect of the Nashville Sound, and his uncle Harold Bradley, a famed guitarist. Jerry Bradley became head of RCA Nashville in 1973, succeeding Chet Akins and bringing in new artists like Alabama and Ronnie Milsap. He helped market the outlaws of country music in a platinum-selling album called \u201cWanted: The Outlaws.\u201d Under his leadership, the careers of Dolly Parton and Charley Pride flourished.\n\nMarty Stuart and Travis Tritt performed \u201cGood Hearted Woman,\u201d a song made famous by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson. Americana star Yola gave an electrifying performance on \u201cJolene\u201d and Old Crow Medicine Show made Alabama\u2019s \u201cDixieland Delight\u201d into a frantic bluegrass breakdown with Molly Tuttle.\n\n\u201cThis business has given me a wonderful life,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cI am grateful for the people I\u2019ve met, the songs I\u2019ve heard and the part I\u2019ve played.\u201d\n\n__\n\nOnline:\n\n__\n\nFollow Kristin M.
