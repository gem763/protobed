Marijuana is federally outlawed, however, creating obstacles for growers, sellers and other stakeholders hoping to do business with licensed banks.\n\n\u201cThe SAFE Banking Act is focused solely on taking cash off the streets and making our communities safer,\u201d Rep. Ed Perlmutter, Colorado Democrat and the bill\u2019s main sponsor, said when he introduced it in March. \u201cOnly Congress can provide the certainty financial institutions need to start banking legitimate marijuana businesses \u2014 just like any other legal business \u2014 and reduce risks for employees, businesses and communities across the country.\u201d\n\nThe bill has since garnered the support of 206 co-sponsors in the House, including 26 Republicans, while companion legislation pending in the GOP-controlled Senate currently lists 33 co-sponsors, mostly Democrats.\n\nSkeptics on in both chambers of Congress have been recently vocal about the effort, however, including notably progressives seeking broader reform. A staffer for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, indicated that the congresswoman may vote against the bill because it lacks provisions addressing social equity, saying she \u201cfeels strongly that addressing racial justice should be the first priority,\u201d the Marijuana Moment news site reported.\n\n\u201cAs I said earlier this year, any marijuana legislation moving through Congress must include restorative justice for those most harmed by the War on Drugs in order to get my vote,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker, New Jersey Democrat, echoed Friday.\n\nMr. Hoyer said the House bill will be considered under a process known as suspension of the rules, meaning it will require approval from two-thirds of the chamber, or 290 members, in order to pass.\n\nMr. Perlmutter, its main sponsor, plans to make changes ahead of the upcoming vote to broaden the bill\u2019s appeal among Republicans, Marijuana Moment reported.\n\nNo vote has been scheduled for the Senate bill.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
