At $699, it is also $50 cheaper than the starting price of the iPhone XR.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone 11, Apple announced the iPhone 11 Pro, which is being touted as \u201cthe most advanced and detailed iPhone yet\u201d, with a three-lens \u201cpro\u201d camera system, more energy efficiency and spatial audio sound. It will start at $999.\n\n\u201cIt enables a whole new level of photography,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, of the iPhone 11 Pro. \u201cIt\u2019s the first phone we have called Pro.\u201d\n\nApple Watch Series 5 launched with always-on screen Read more\n\nApple underscored the ambitiousness of the new pro system by showcasing images taken on the devices by professional photographers. A short black-and-white film, shot by the director Diego Contreras and the cinematographer Guillermo Garza, on the iPhone 11 Pro and played before the crowd at Tuesday\u2019s event, highlighted \u201cthe computational photography mad science\u201d of the new three-lens system with 4x optical zoom. The Oscar-nominated film director Sean Baker, who shot his 2015 feature film Tangerine entirely on an earlier model of the iPhone, was also invited onstage to speak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always excited when I see new evolutions in the craft,\u201d Baker said, adding the new tools will help in \u201creducing the number of takes and giving me more options in post [production]\u201d.\n\nThe iPhone 11 has a dual camera, which includes a second camera featuring an ultra-wide lens as opposed to a telephoto lens as in past devices. Artificial intelligence capabilities in the camera will auto-adjust lighting and reduce noise to allow users to take low-light images and more detailed portraits. It also features a front-facing portrait mode and slo-mo video capabilities in the front-facing camera.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro has even more advanced photo capabilities, with the three camera lenses allowing for more details, smart lighting and wider shots. Videos made with the iPhone 11 Pro cameras will shoot in 4k resolution at 60 frames per second.\n\n\u201cWe think this is the most exciting iPhone we have made yet,\u201d Schiller said.\n\nThe announcements on Tuesday come as Apple faces a host of business challenges, from the US-China trade war to antitrust investigations by the federal government. The company has also faced privacy setbacks \u2013 in July the Guardian revealed that contractors regularly listen to confidential details about people\u2019s lives while reviewing Siri recordings, and in August researchers at Google revealed an unprecedented iPhone hacking operation.\n\nSiri, sex and Apple's privacy problem Read more\n\nIt also marks the first product launch since Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s longtime chief design officer, announced his upcoming departure.\n\nApple also revealed the Apple Watch Series 5 at Tuesday\u2019s event, which will have an always-on screen while maintaining up to 18 hours of battery life.\n\nThe iPad also got an update. The new 7th generation of the product will have a larger screen of 10.2 inches, up from 9.7 inches, and support for the Apple Pencil and Smart Connector, which lets users attach Apple\u2019s own keyboards to the device to turn it into a pseudo-laptop. The device will retail for $329 and start shipping on 30 September.\n\nAs device sales have fallen in recent years, Apple has placed more of an emphasis on new services such as Apple TV+, the company\u2019s answer to streaming platforms such as Netflix and Hulu. Tuesday\u2019s event revealed more details about those services, including Apple Arcade, a subscription service announced in March 2019 that will provide access to exclusive mobile games. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ will launch in more than 100 countries on 1 November at $4.99 a month. It will not have commercials and will feature original series.\n\nThe pivot to apps and services comes at a time when it is also facing antitrust scrutiny over complaints that the App Store favors its own services over others.\n\nApple also took the opportunity on Tuesday to promote its privacy capabilities, saying privacy is \u201cbuilt from the ground up\u201d in each device. The focus on privacy may be an attempt to draw attention away from other shortcomings, said John Maeda, the chief experience officer at digital consultancy Publicis Sapient.\n\n\u201cAs Apple starts to become less relevant to consumers with diminishing impact from fancy industrial design tricks and their cloud software offerings that cannot compete with Google\u2019s, they\u2019re subtly doubling down on how their device ecosystem is inherently more private than any other ones out there,\u201d he said.", "description": "iPhone 11 Pro is being touted as \u2018the most advanced and detailed iPhone yet\u2019 with a three-lens \u2018pro\u2019 camera system", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57267f098593e61833d3bce131b816cb6fcd3d9b/0_0_5287_3172/master/5287.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=76c7501d01b805d31d3e3b0f732adfc4", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
