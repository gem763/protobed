His appointment comes about seven months after the company\u2019s new Chief Executive Mark Clouse took over in late January.\n\nMr. Beekhuizen, the finance leader of yogurt maker Chobani LLC, replaces Anthony DiSilvestro, who has served in the role since 2014.\n\nAnalysts and recruiters said they expected the company to appoint a new CFO less than a year into the tenure of the new CEO.\n\n\u201cNew CEOs really want their partner,\u201d said Peter Crist, the chairman of executive recruitment firm Crist|Kolder Associates.\n\nKraft Heinz Co. , which in June got a new chief executive, on Monday appointed a new finance chief. Kellogg Co. appointed a new CFO in May, about 19 months into the tenure of Chief Executive Steven A. Cahillane. And Mondelez International Inc. took less than a year to name a new finance head after CEO Dirk Van de Put took over in November 2017.\n\nThe bond between a company\u2019s chief executive and its finance chief is crucial, especially at companies dealing with a range of challenges such as Campbell, Mr. Crist said. \u201cIf those two people don\u2019t feel good about each other, there will be a change,\u201d he said.\n\nCampbell didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a press release Thursday, Mr. Clouse, the CEO, praised Mr. DiSilvestro, the CFO who is leaving the company on Oct. 15. \u201cAnthony has been a strong leader during his Campbell career and a valuable partner during my first seven months with the company,\u201d he said.\n\nCampbell faces shifting consumer tastes toward products perceived as fresher and growing competition from store-brand products developed by retailers. The company is expected to report financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Friday.\n\nChief executives and finance chiefs must share a vision for the company\u2019s strategy to succeed, said Cathy Logue, a managing director at executive search firm Stanton Chase. \u201cThey have to work hand in glove,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Beekhuizen is expected to help bring down the company\u2019s debt level as well as finding around $315 million in cost savings as part of a $850 million cost reduction effort to be completed in fiscal 2022, analysts said.\n\nCampbell had $9.1 billion in net debt at the end of its fiscal third quarter, down from $9.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2018, according to S&P Capital IQ. The company\u2019s debt spiked following the $6.1 billion acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance in late 2017.\n\nThe company also needs to ramp up investments in its soup business, said Diane Shand, a senior director at S&P Global Ratings. Mr. Beekhuizen will have to convince investors that he can run the finances at a much larger company than Chobani, she said.\n\n\u2014Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Campbell Soup\u2019s move to replace its finance chief follows an expected pattern in which new a chief executive selects his or her own finance chief to execute a strategy.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102702/social"}
