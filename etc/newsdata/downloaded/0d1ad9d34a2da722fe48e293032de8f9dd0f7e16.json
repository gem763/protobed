He got the job.\n\nTaylor said Cummings made an equally meaningful impression when rioting erupted in 2015 at this very intersection after the funeral of Freddie Gray, who had suffered fatal injuries in police custody. For several nights, the congressman was a fixture at the crossroads, using his own bullhorn to implore people to return home, even as some cursed and taunted him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was out here, and it was good to see him on the front lines,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cHe did the right thing. Mr. Cummings always did the right thing.\u201d\n\nAs this city has endured a litany of political and police corruption scandals in recent years, Cummings, 68, distinguished himself as the rare local leader whom many residents felt they could still trust.\n\nDuring crises, he had the capacity to express the city\u2019s anguish with eloquence and passion, his presence a measure of reassurance to many who worried that chaos was overwhelming Baltimore.\n\nHis constituents expressed their loyalty at the ballot box, reelecting the congressman every two years since 1996. They were quick to defend him when President Trump in July belittled Cummings as an ineffectual leader who presided over a rat-infested district.\n\n\u201cWe respected him,\u201d said Chanda McDonald, 36, a West Baltimore mortician, sitting on a stoop with a friend near Pennsylvania and North avenues. \u201cTo have him out here during the rioting showed that he was trying to help us. It showed that he was for us, and that we needed to pull together.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCummings\u2019s death early Thursday stunned a predominantly black city in which he had been a political leader since the early 1980s, first in the Maryland House of Delegates and then in Congress.\n\nA local Baltimore radio station, WBAL, devoted hours of broadcast time to the news, with leaders calling in to express their sorrow.\n\n\u201cBabe! Elijah Cummings died!\u201d Antonio Haire, 62, a retired machine operator, recalled telling his wife as he woke her up in their East Baltimore home.\n\n\u201cI feel like we lost a leader who spoke for us,\u201d Haire said after eating lunch at Lexington Market. \u201cHe was a black politician, someone we could say, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s a chance for us.\u2019 Someone our kids can look at and say, \u2018Hey, I can do better \u2014 I don\u2019t have to be someone who is washing windows with a squeegee.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA couple of tables over, Henry Jackson, 56, a procurement specialist, described Cummings as \u201cone of the standing pillars in this city,\u201d a leader who never lost his connection to the voters who elected him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis was his city,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSo many work here but don\u2019t live here day-to-day. That he didn\u2019t run off to his house in the hills speaks volumes to me.\u201d\n\nCummings was a staple of Washington power circles, a regular on Sunday talk shows as he presided over the House Oversight Committee and helped represent the Democratic Party on the national stage. But he also commanded a prominent place in the day-to-day life of his hometown, where he was born in 1951, the son of sharecroppers who had migrated to the city from South Carolina.\n\nEven as he dealt with presidents and senators in the nation\u2019s capital, he kept a careful eye on what was happening in his city, whether it was how the Orioles or the Ravens were faring, or what was happening with a tightly contested mayor\u2019s race or a political neophyte trying to win a council seat.\n\n\u201cWe all kind of stand on his shoulders,\u201d said state Del. Nick Mosby (D-Baltimore City), adding that Cummings became a mentor for him after he met the congressman when introducing him as the guest speaker at his high school graduation more than two decades ago. \u201cI always would sort of pinch myself that he would answer my calls.\u201d\n\nCummings didn\u2019t always tell Mosby what he wanted to hear. In 2011, the congressman advised him not to run for City Council, arguing that he had already lost a previous election. \u201cHe said, \u2018You can\u2019t lose again, you don\u2019t want to become a loser,\u2019 \u201d Mosby said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMosby ran and won, picking up Cummings\u2019s endorsement just before the election.\n\nAt his victory party, Mosby recalled, the congressman pulled him aside and \u201cwas telling me how to set up my office, who I needed to call, and what I needed to do. I always thought it was cool how he would call me to get the temperature of the city.\u201d\n\nBut the congressman often didn\u2019t have to ask anybody. Until his death, he lived in West Baltimore, in an elegant red-brick rowhouse less than a mile from the intersection of Pennsylvania and North.\n\nA man of seemingly modest tastes, Cummings liked to hold breakfast and lunch meetings at places such as at Jimmy\u2019s, a well-known Fell\u2019s Point diner. After the 2015 unrest, when he walked into the Village Square Cafe, another favorite haunt, patrons stood and gave him a standing ovation, said Robert Glick, the owner.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCummings, he said, never wanted special treatment.\n\n\u201cHe generally valued his privacy and was a gentleman,\u201d Glick said.\n\nOver the years, Cummings was a visible presence in his neighborhood, though he faded from view as his health deteriorated.\n\nDarrine Timpson, 23, who grew up on the block where Cummings lived, recalled knocking on his door as a little boy, dressed as Batman for Halloween. The congressman gave him a handful of Tootsie Rolls.\n\nBy then, Timpson said, he had grown accustomed to seeing his neighbor on the television news, a recognition that a man from his neighborhood \u2014 a neighborhood with a long history of drug abuse and violence \u2014 had achieved great success and had the ears of mayors, governors and presidents.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so unexpected,\u201d he said of Cummings\u2019s death. \u201cMy mind is blown.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBarbara Fryson, 61, a retiree who lives a block away from the congressman\u2019s home, said she often dropped notes inside his front door, advising him that \u201cthis block or that block needed cleaning up or that a school needed extra teachers.\u201d\n\nWhen she ran into him, she said, \u201cHe would stop and ask, \u2018How you doing? Everything okay? How\u2019s the neighborhood?\u2019 If I told him about a problem, he\u2019d say he\u2019d look into it. It was comforting that he showed interest.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one you remember the most because he always spoke up for us,\u201d she said, her voice infused with sadness. \u201cHe was the city\u2019s voice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn that moment, she said, it was hard to imagine who would now speak the words that seemed to come so easily to the congressman.\n\nAD", "description": "Longtime congressman who died Thursday was a powerful presence in Washington and on his city\u2019s streets.", "authors": ["Paul Schwartzman", "Reporter Specializing In Political Profiles", "Narratives About Life", "Death", "Everything In Between"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_389OhiURrBGGcA6aVH4tAkbvmE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L3BLP7HRBQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
