During the discussion, he laid out their failures, the biggest one being that most are corrupt and want to get rich off politics.\n\n\"Is Hillary Clinton someone who could get in there and do at least as good as they can?\" Pirro asked, referencing Democratic frontrunners Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\n\"She can't and she wouldn't win and she knew she wouldn't win and this whole thing is another ploy because she wants to stay relevant in this whole process,\" he explained, referencing Clinton calling Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) a Russian asset.\n\nTrump reminded Pirro that Democrats are fighting a strong economy, record unemployment, high consumer confidence and a kind of patriotism that hasn't existed in decades.\n\n\"They're fighting all of this yet they have a candidate that lies about being a Cherokee Indian when she's 1/1024th Cherokee,\" he said, referencing Warren.\n\n\"You have a guy whose son is embezzling money from everyone and enriching himself off his father's position,\" Trump said, referencing former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\"Where does Joe Biden get off being so pompous and above it all?\" Pirro asked.\n\n\"You know, I think the American people are going to see that. He is pompous and they are above it all,\" Trump replied. \"If I was doing the same thing that that family is doing, I'd be in jail. Why is it that every family goes into politics and enriches themselves?\"\n\nAccording to Trump, his family is the only family in politics who didn't get rich based off position or political ties.\n\n\"We stopped doing deals when my father became [president],\" he explained. \"He's a businessman and we were business people. We stopped doing deals when he went into politics. Guess what? All these kids started doing deals when their family went into politics and it's sickening.\"", "description": "Boom..10/20/2019 12:57:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/293/43a4a498-8f91-4dbe-8a28-afa7e412f2b6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
