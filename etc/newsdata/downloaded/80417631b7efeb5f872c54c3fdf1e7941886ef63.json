Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWarren has said she wants to rein in Wall Street and break up big tech while Sanders has taken on the likes of corporate giants Walmart and Amazon.\n\nBoth candidates have called for health care for all and the forgiveness of student debt. Each would come at a hefty price tag. Health care for all would cost an additional $34 trillion over the first decade, according to the Urban Institute, a center-left leaning think tank.\n\nWarren\u2019s student debt plan would cancel student loans for millions of Americans while Sanders\u2019 would place the burden on Wall Street. Both plans would come at an enormous burden to taxpayers say, experts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The straight-talking banking CEO is straightening out the true meaning of social policies.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/Jamie-Dimon-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
