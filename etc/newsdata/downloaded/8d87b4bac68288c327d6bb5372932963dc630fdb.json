Bernard Sanders said in a new interview that he plans to pay for \u201cevery nickel\u201d of his universal \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care system, but that he doesn\u2019t think he has to provide an exact, detailed plan at the moment about how the proposal would affect individual Americans\u2019 taxes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to pay for the damn thing,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview with CNBC published on Tuesday. \u201cBut I think at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, it is my view that the wealthiest people in this country, the top 1/10th of 1%, should be paying substantially more than they\u2019re paying right now.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders\u2018 office has outlined a list of potential pay-fors, including a wealth tax and an increase in corporate taxes. But they only cover about half of the plan\u2019s estimated $34 trillion price tag over 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe fight right now is to get the American people to understand that we\u2019re spending twice as much per capita, that of course, we can pay for it,\u201d said the Vermont independent and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. \u201cWe\u2019re paying it now in a very reactionary, regressive way. I want to pay for it in a progressive way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to come up with an exact detailed plan of how every American \u2014 how much you\u2019re going to pay more in taxes, how much I\u2019m going to pay. I don\u2019t think I have to do that right now,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a top 2020 rival from Massachusetts, has promised more details on how she plans to pay for her universal health care plan, and Mr. Sanders said it\u2019s not \u201cfoolish\u201d for Ms. Warren to do so.\n\n\u201cAll that I\u2019m saying is that we have laid out a variety of options which are progressive. \u2026 We\u2019ll have that debate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we will pay for every nickel of Medicare for All, and it will save the overwhelming majority of the American people, who will no longer pay premiums.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
