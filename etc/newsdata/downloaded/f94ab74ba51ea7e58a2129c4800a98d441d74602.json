Myers Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe pair were both entered in the 100 metres even though they had said they did not intend to take part. Under IAAF rules, they were then barred from the rest of the competition for failing to turn up for the races.\n\nHowever, on Sunday the IAAF jury said it accepted their appeal and agreed to reinstate them. \u201cOduduru and Okabare will be added to the start lists of round one of the 200 men and women respectively\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nOduduru then made the most of his reprieve as he finished fourth in his heat to qualify for the semi-finals as one of the fastest losers.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. I had a sleepless night. I was up all night thinking. Then devastated.\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), which had tweeted on Friday that the pair would only race 200 metres, has been criticised over the failure to withdraw them from the 100 metres.\n\nOduduru agreed that the AFN should take more responsibility.\n\n\u201cThey should stand up to what they are supposed to do and get things right so people don\u2019t think that we the athletes are the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a system that is supposed to do something for us the athletes.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister for Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, was among the critics of the situation.\n\n\u201cDoha - all day I have followed the developments around two of our Athletes, Divine and Blessing,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cOur officials are at the IAAF Technical Information Center as we speak. Nigerians deserve an explanation.\u201d\n\nOduduru added that he was proud to represent Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI go to school in the U.S, everyone knows that I\u2019m going to run for my country because I am a Nigerian. I\u2019m ready to fly my country\u2019s flag anytime, any day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI came out here to prove to my people that I\u2019m not running away from my country. I\u2019m out to do what I\u2019m supposed to do as an athlete.\u201d", "description": "Nigerian pair Divine Oduduru and Blessing Okagbare have been reprieved after an apparent bureaucratic mix-up and will race in the men's and women's 200 metres races respectively at the world athletics championships.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435447100&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0DH-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
