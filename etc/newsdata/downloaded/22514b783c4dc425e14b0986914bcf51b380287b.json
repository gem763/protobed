He writes that hypothetical John, if he were to opt out of compulsory super and choose to take it as wages, would be more than $500,000 worse off in his retirement balance and would pay more than $100,000 additional tax over his working lifetime by virtue of higher wages.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not sufficient to leave it at that, as if such partial analysis self-evidently proves the case for compulsory super. It does not.\n\nFor what Mr Combet did not state was the present value of the age pension foregone by having a higher super balance. Nor did he state the present value of the extra wages earned. All four components need to be considered, not just two, before drawing any conclusions about the merits of compulsory superannuation.\n\nDavid McNeice\n\nBalwyn North, Vic\n\nDrought aid shows welfare hypocrisy\n\nAaron Patrick\u2019s \u2018\u2018Morrison takes his own Greta Thunberg on drought trip\u2019\u2019 (October 3) on drought aid for farmers should have had front-page billing. Farmers with $5 million of assets who cannot survive normal climatic variations should not be in the business. Pity the non-farmer small business people in drought-hit regions who can only watch on with dismay as these \u2018\u2018fat cats\u2019\u2019 collect the \u2018\u2018demoralising and dehumanising\u2019\u2019 Farm Household Assistance welfare, while they can still earn income off-farm, and get the usual tax breaks. The hypocrisy of successive Coalition governments pandering to this group while demonising other welfare recipients is breathtaking.\n\nBarry Cook\n\nSoldiers Point, NSW\n\nNo Nanny State for lazy borrowers\n\nBecause the recent 0.15 per cent reduction in mortgage lending rates falls short of the 0.25 per cent reduction in the RBA\u2019s rate, there has been widespread claims that \u201cthe government should do something about it\u201d. However, it is also reported that new borrowers can get a lower rate than existing borrowers, by 0.4 per cent apparently.\n\nSo, if a borrower can save 0.4 per cent by walking down the street to another bank, why should the Nanny State be expected to do what individuals are too lazy to do themselves?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge McGregor\n\nMalvern, Vic\n\nTime for re-think on think tanks\n\nAs Parnell Palme McGuinness correctly observes (\u2018\u2018Time to invest in ideas factories\u2019\u2019 October 2), in the early 1970s, free market think tanks were highly successful in seizing on Keynesian stagflation to advance their ideas. The restructuring of advanced economies that followed undoubtedly generated dynamism and growth.\n\nNow free market capitalism faces its early seventies moment. The confluence of problems it faces could be be termed \u2018\u2018stagtration\u2019\u2019: dwindling economic growth caused by upwards concentration in wealth. The motors of capitalism\u2019s halcyon days of the 50s and 60s \u2013 the rising working and middle classes, are in retreat.\n\nThink tanks offering more of what got us here aren\u2019t much help, as McGuinness points out. Rebooting the advanced economies this time around will involve sacrificing some IPA and CIS sacred cows. What businesses are going to tip in money to promote that?\n\nDan Murphy, School of Education, University of Melbourne\n\nChina already world\u2019s largest economy\n\nThere is one problem with Angus Grigg\u2019s (September 28-29) argument that China may not become the world\u2019s largest economy. It already is.\n\nThe World Bank and the IMF calculate that the Chinese economy is around 20 per cent larger than that of the US. This is using the conceptually preferable purchasing power parity measure, rather than converting all countries\u2019 GDP into US dollars using volatile exchange rates that do not take into account price differences between countries. When we want to calculate how much Australia\u2019s real GDP in 2018 has grown since 2017, we use a \u2018constant price\u2019 measure to strip out price differences between the years. The PPP measure does an analogous thing for cross-country comparisons, adjusting for price differences across countries. China of course has a much larger population so still trails the US in per capita measures, which are generally used when classifying countries as high income or developed.\n\nDr John Hawkins\n\nUniversity of Canberra", "description": "Alfred Deakin, superannuation, farm welfare, interest rates, neo-liberalism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
