I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you come to us young people for hope. How dare you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering,\u201d the 16-year-old continued through tears. \u201cPeople are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are at the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say you hear us and understand the urgency, but no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe.\u201d\n\nTrump, whose administration has rolled back environmental protections and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, was not scheduled to attend the event, but he showed up briefly, arriving after Thunberg had spoken and leaving after about 10 minutes.\n\nThunberg, though, did see Trump in the hallway.\n\nLast week, the teenager testified on Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d who say climate change is real and that humans are responsible \u2014 conclusions that Trump has resisted.\n\n\u201cI want you to unite behind science,\u201d Thunberg said in her testimony before the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis on Wednesday. \u201cI want you to unite behind science. And then I want you to take action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not political views or my opinions,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is science.\u201d\n\nThunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel Prize for her work raising awareness about climate change, has become an inspirational figure for fellow teens. Last month, she sailed from Europe to the United States on a zero-emission yacht.\n\nArriving in New York City after her 15-day trip across the Atlantic Ocean, she was asked if she had a message for Trump.\n\n\u201cMy message for him is listen to the science,\u201d Thunberg told reporters. \u201cAnd he obviously doesn't do that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "\u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist\u2019s bio now reads.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qryLjo9hxskJ5pyqQDxUUg--~B/aD0xMDI0O3c9MTgzMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/ab20e730-dee8-11e9-b655-7dfca9216873", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
