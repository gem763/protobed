Here\u2019s one example I\u2019d like to share with readers that straddles the \"jerk\" line: On a recent flight, I was seated next to a woman who seemed perfectly normal and polite. After a brief disagreement on political events \u2014 I\u2019ll spare you the details, but it somehow came up \u2014 we continued to sit amicably alongside one another, despite our differences.\n\nUpon landing, she suddenly broke out into applause and was joined by at least a handful of other passengers. It was nearly 1am when we landed, and naturally, I was startled. Upon seeing my reaction and refusal to clap, she turned to me \u2014 and without hesitation \u2014 called me a \u201csnob\u201d.\n\nLook, it\u2019s great that we were alive but the pilots will not hear my applause, nor will they care. But am I just being an arsehole? Generally, I don\u2019t care if others clap, I just don\u2019t want to nor should I be made to feel bad about it. But maybe this was just a miscommunication; perhaps she believed I was judging her for applauding, in which case, \u201csnob\u201d might be totally fitting.\n\nThe Washington Post recently took a deep-dive into the origins of why some people clap after landing. There are reasons to believe it might just be a coping mechanism for infrequent fliers and particularly after long or turbulent flights.\n\nAccording to our managing editor, Virginia, it may also simply be a matter of cultural differences. (A Travel and Leisure story from 2016 suggests this premise, too.)\n\nSo to our readers, we ask: Do you clap when your plane has made it to its destination? (If so, please tell us why.) And do you care if other passengers clap?", "description": "Sometimes, it\u2019s not exactly clear if you're being a jerk, so the Lifehacker team spent the last week tackling this exact topic through \"Jerk Week\".
