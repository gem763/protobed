That gold Toyota that police are investigating is registered to this address and the name on that registration is the same as the man police identified as the alleged shooter.\n\nA neighbor says she would see a man at the property shoot guns randomly at night. She says he owned at least two \u2013 a rifle and a handgun -- and one time he came to her door with that rifle.\n\nRELATED: 'Action is needed': Gov.

They used a loudspeaker, telling anyone in the home that they have a search warrant and to come out with their hands up.\n\nThey also used an Odessa Police bomb squad robot inside the home. It\u2019s unclear right now what they were looking for and it\u2019s also unclear if the suspected shooter lived here.\n\nOther people who live in this neighborhood say watching all this unfold puts them on edge.\n\n\u201cI lived in El Paso and when I was out there, that happened,\u201d said Chris Alvidrez. \u201cNow this happens here. I just kind of want to go back home, I guess.\n\nAnother neighbor says the man who lived there was very aggressive. She says she called police a month ago, but they couldn\u2019t find the address on GPS.\n\nNow the FBI is scouring the property for any evidence that could help them piece this puzzle together.\n\nPolice say people in town should expect to see lots of police activity with search warrants being executed in the next few days.", "description": "The FBI, ATF and DEA agents wearing tactical gear used an armored vehicle to get inside the home.", "authors": ["Author", "Chris", "Published", "Pm Cdt September", "Updated"], "top_image": "https://media.newswest9.com/assets/KWES/images/4bce4b28-0942-4b38-bd79-1467bdc26329/4bce4b28-0942-4b38-bd79-1467bdc26329_1140x641.jpg"}
