NBC has long claimed that Farrow\u2019s reporting, as presented to it, was not fit to run with. Farrow\u2019s work ultimately appeared in The New Yorker, which is known for its vigorous fact-checking, so numerous theories have since been floated about why the Peacock Network passed.\n\nLAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'\n\nThe son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen has been expected to tell his side of the NBC saga in \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d But it's just one of the bombshells he shared with The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Marisa Guthrie in an interview published on Wednesday, along with information from Guthrie's advance look at the book in an office at publisher Little, Brown.\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment to a series of questions about Farrow's interview with The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nFox News has not seen the book, that is scheduled to be released on Tuesday. But here are six takeaways from Farrow's blockbuster interview:\n\n\u2018TODAY\u2019 ADDRESSES \u2018APPALLING\u2019 NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT\u2019S JUST VERY PAINFUL'\n\nTHR: Farrow\u2019s book will detail Weinstein\u2019s alleged attempts to silence NBC\n\nWeinstein attempted to \u201cbully\u201d NBC News into killing the story by leveraging information about then-NBC News anchor Matt Lauer, according to Guthrie. An executive from National Enquirer publisher American Media helped Weinstein formulate a plan to silence NBC News, according to Guthrie, and the duo found a \u201cpressure point\u201d against the network when he learned of alleged behavior by Lauer.\n\n\"Weinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it.\" The book documents \"a period in which secrets at NBC were under threat of exposure,\" Farrow wrote in his book, according to Guthrie. \"And it is very clear from the conversations I document how heavily those secrets weighed on their [reporting] judgment.\"\n\nIn a statement to THR, NBC News denied this claim and said \u201cthe idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.\u201d\n\nRONAN FARROW'S TEAM 'CONFIDENT IN THE FACTS' IN NEW #METOO BOOK, DISMISSES LEGAL THREAT FROM EX-NATIONAL ENQUIRER EDITOR\n\nTHR: Farrow will directly name high-powered NBC executives\n\nThe book details \"Weinstein's personal interactions with NBC News and MSNBC chairman Andy Lack, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC president Phil Griffin,\u201d according to Guthrie, who notes that the disgraced movie mogul called them frequently enough \u201cthat Weinstein's assistants who were asked to place phone calls to the men dubbed them \u2018the triumvirate.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCatch and Kill\u201d will also detail \u201cjust how deep Weinstein's connections ran within NBC and reveals his aggressive effort to court additional executives,\u201d Guthrie wrote.\n\nTHR also indicated that claims of sexual misconduct against NBC executives themselves will be included in the book.\n\nNBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK SLAMMED FOR KEEPING SEX MISCONDUCT REVIEW IN-HOUSE\n\nTHR: The book will reportedly contradict NBC\u2019s internal review\n\nAfter an internal review, NBC declared in 2018 that NBC News management was oblivious to Lauer\u2019s alleged pervy past. The controversial review was conducted by in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an independent investigation.\n\n\u201cFarrow uncovers seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by Lauer that seem to contradict the network's stance that management had no knowledge of his behavior as well as seven nondisclosure agreements \u2014 many with hush-money payouts \u2014 to accusers of Lauer and others at NBC. Multiple Lauer accusers, including the woman whose complaint to NBC's human resources department resulted in the star's ouster, tell their stories in detail,\u201d Guthrie wrote. \"NBC maintains that it had no knowledge of Lauer's behavior before he was fired.\"\n\nNBC News maintained it had no knowledge of Lauer\u2019s misconduct in a statement to THR.\n\nMADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY\n\nTHR: Publisher Little, Brown has gone to great lengths to keep the book under wraps.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to avoid any leaks, the publisher has gone to great lengths to secure the book's contents before publication. The Hollywood Reporter is one of only a handful of outlets allowed an early read, and even that had to be done in a conference room at Little, Brown's Midtown [Manhattan] offices under the gaze of a minder,\u201d Guthrie wrote.\n\nGuthrie indicated that she was eventually given a watermarked copy that she promised not to read in public.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED TO ACCUSE\n\nTHR: Weinstein allegedly used his friendship with Hillary Clinton, too\n\n\u201cWeinstein also attempted to leverage his long-term relationship with Hillary Clinton to pressure Farrow,\u201d Guthrie reported.\n\nGuthrie said Farrow was attempting to interview Clinton for an unrelated project in the summer of 2017, and the former secretary of atate\u2019s publicist later informed Weinstein that Farrow was working on a concerning story.\n\n\u201cThen, in September 2017, according to an email cited in the book, Weinstein wrote to Deborah Turness, the ex-president of NBC News who now runs NBC News International, to propose a docuseries on Clinton,\u201d Guthrie wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTHR: Farrow says he is banned from NBC with one exception\n\nFarrow appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d in October 2017 following the release of his Weinstein scoop and famously hinted that NBC News passed on the report. \"I walked in the door at The New Yorker with an explosive, reportable piece that should have been made public earlier,\u201d he told Maddow.\n\nGuthrie wrote that this segment \u201cset off a firestorm at NBC\u201d\n\n\u201cThe moment they were off the air, Maddow's phone rang, and Farrow could hear {MSNBC President Phil] Griffin screaming through the receiver,\u201d Guthrie wrote. \u201cFarrow believes that he is blacklisted from NBC News and MSNBC. Only Maddow has had the clout to flout this ban; she had him on her show in April 2018, to discuss his foreign policy book, \u2018War on Peace.\u2019 NBC's executives deny Farrow is banned, but multiple sources tell THR that their attempts to book Farrow have been quashed.\u201d\n\nMSNBC did not immediately respond when asked if Farrow is subject to such a ban.", "description": "Ronan Farrow has been tight-lipped about his highly anticipated book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d but the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter spoke to The Hollywood Reporter for his first interview about the top-secret project.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
