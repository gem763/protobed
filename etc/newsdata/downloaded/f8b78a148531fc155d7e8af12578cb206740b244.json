REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nSpeaking to Fox News Sunday, Pompeo added that he was confident U.S. President Donald Trump would take action if such deterrence measures fail and that this was well understood by the Iranian leadership.\n\n\u201cOur mission set is to avoid war,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cYou saw what Secretary Esper announced on Friday, we are putting additional forces in the region for the purpose of deterrence and defense,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo said Washington was taking measures to deter Tehran, but he added that Trump would take necessary action if Tehran failed to change its behavior. \u201cIf that deterrence should continue to fail, I am also confident that President Trump would continue to take the actions that are necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nTensions between Washington and Tehran have further escalated after an attack last weekend on Saudi oil facilities that initially disrupted half of the oil production from the kingdom, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, and was blamed on Tehran by the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n\nU.S. has slapped more sanctions on Iran, penalizing the Iranian Central Bank while the Pentagon said it was sending U.S. troops to bolster Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defenses after the largest-ever attack on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nIran denied involvement in the attack. Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen\u2019s civil war, has claimed responsibility.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking to CNN, said the attack on Saudi oil facilities was an attack on the world economic system. He said the United States expects that any country attached to the U.S. dollar system will abide by the sanctions on Iran.\n\nTrump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year and ramped up sanctions to strangle its oil exports, a mainstay of the Iranian economy.\n\nThe move dismantled part of former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy and upset U.S. allies who were party to the agreement, which was designed to restrict Tehran\u2019s pathway to a nuclear bomb in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump had weighed the possibility of easing sanctions on Iran and suggested he could meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is due to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York this week. Rouhani has said that Iran, which denies seeking nuclear weapons, would not talk to the United States until Washington lifted sanctions.", "description": "The United States aims to avoid war with Iran and the additional troops ordered to be deployed in the Gulf region are for \"deterrence and defense,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Humeyra Pamuk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432642390&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0FX", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
