The cost of that is $750 million and to replace it with a new plant would be $2 billion.\"\n\nThe bedrock\n\nCoal-fired plants were the bedrock of keeping energy costs down and retaining jobs in Australia, he said.\n\n\"If we don't keep it going, we won't keep business and jobs in this country.\"\n\nMr St Baker dismissed the need for Australia to do more to reach international climate targets, saying it was more important to protect jobs and the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"All of this pantomime that goes on about how we have to have 100 per cent sun and wind,\" he said, was not focusing on the big issue of power reliability.\n\nGrattan Institute energy program director Tony Wood said that instead of squeezing coal-fired power stations out of the market early, they should be allowed to reach the end of their natural life.\n\n\"I think it's more about a commercial life. I think technical life is really irrelevant,'' he said.\n\nMr Wood said problems emerged when governments started intervening.\n\n\"The problem is that as soon as governments become worried, they start doing stuff,'' he said.\n\nAustralian Energy Council chief executive Sarah McNamara agreed, saying that ideology should be stripped out of the whole debate about the future of coal.\n\n\"I don't think ideology is very helpful when it comes to talking about our energy mix,'' she said.\n\n\"We should be technology neutral. Coal is absolutely 100 per cent going to be part of our energy mix through to 2050.\"", "description": "Keeping older coal-fired plants operating for longer makes economic sense and will help keep jobs in Australia, the coal baron says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3006%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_27%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c3d1c229c51d8a73d36706b44122bb3acfc0d07e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
