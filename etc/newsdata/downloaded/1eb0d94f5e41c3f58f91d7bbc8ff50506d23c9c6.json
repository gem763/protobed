In a number of instances, those sources were uncited Wikipedia pages created before the book\u2019s publication in early 2018.\n\nMany of the passages included citations of the works from which language was drawn, but did not put that language in quotation marks. In one case, Schweizer\u2019s book used language nearly identical to a post on a website of a prominent progressive think tank, but cited not that think tank, but a news article based on the same data.\n\nThe Daily Beast presented Schweizer\u2019s spokesperson and his publisher, HarperCollins, with a detailed spreadsheet comparing the book\u2019s text with that of the sources from which he appeared to have lifted language. That spokesperson, Sandy Schulz, denied that the examples constituted any sort of journalistic or academic misconduct.\n\n\u201cThis is not plagiarism,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cSecret Empires was run through Grammarly\u2019s plagiarism checker years ago. The examples you cite are trivial snatches of words occurring in a straightforward recitation of publicly available facts... If the analysis you apply to these selected passages were to become the standard, research-driven journalism, including yours, would become near-impossible.\u201d\n\nSchweizer\u2019s book unearthed extensive details of allegedly corrupt schemes involving, among others, Hunter Biden, the youngest son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. The most explosive allegations stemming from Schweizer\u2019s reporting, chiefly that the elder Biden helped unseat a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect a company whose board included Biden\u2019s son from investigation, have been largely debunked. But the allegations are nevertheless central to a rapidly escalating scandal that threatens to envelop the Trump administration.\n\nNone of the passages examined by The Daily Beast came from the section of the book that deals with the Bidens. The most problematic portion of Secret Empires appears to be a chapter focused on former Chicago mayor Richard Daley. That chapter contains four passages that are largely copied from the Wikipedia page for Daley\u2019s son Patrick. The book\u2019s footnotes cite news stories that are cited in the same Wikipedia page, but the language appears to be lifted from the latter.\n\nThree other passages in the book also appear to draw on Wikipedia pages, though with smaller sections of the sentences at issue, and in less specific language.\n\nOther sections of the book more directly cite the sources from which language appears to have been lifted. But those sections nonetheless copy large portions of text from those sources and do not place quotation marks around them.\n\nA section on the family of Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, for instance, draws from and cites a Chicago Tribune article about a federal clean energy grant to a Chicago-based company with ties to the Pritzker clan. But significant portions of the passage mirror, word-for-word, language in the Tribune piece, and do not appear in quotation marks.\n\nThe Daily Beast found five other instances in which Schweizer uses similar or identical language to sources that are cited in the text, but without denoting any direct quotation.\n\nIn one instance, Schweizer appears to have lifted language from a piece on the website of the Center for American Progress, a prominent progressive think tank, regarding Trump\u2019s business activities abroad. The book cites not that piece but a Washington Post story on the underlying data. But Schweizer\u2019s language mirrors not the Post\u2019s, but CAP\u2019s, down to the names of the same four countries, out of 18, in which Trump did business and the order in which they\u2019re mentioned.\n\nColumbia University defines \u201cintentional\u201d plagiarism to include a \u201cdirect copy [and] paste\u201d of source text or a \u201csmall modification by word switch.\u201d Its definition of \u201cunintentional\u201d plagiarism includes a \u201cfailure to \u2018quote\u2019 or block quote author's exact words, even if documented\u201d and a \u201cfailure to put a paraphrase in your own words, even if documented.\u201d\n\nHard-and-fast definitions of plagiarism are nonetheless disputed, especially in the digital age. \u201cBoth journalism and plagiarism have fallen into a murky new reality in which there\u2019s no clear consensus about the old rules. Even the authorities who make the rules disagree over basic definitions,\u201d wrote Washington Post senior editor Marc Fischer in a 2015 column in the Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cThe same technology that has softened the definition of plagiarism has also made it radically easier to plagiarize, intentionally or not.\u201d\n\nAccording to the acknowledgements in Secret Empires, Schweizer, who leads the nonprofit Government Accountability Institute, received assistance for the book from eight researchers and two interns.\n\nIt\u2019s not his first work to upend American politics heading into a presidential election. His previous book, the bestseller Clinton Cash, detailed extensive conflict-of-interest allegations against then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Scrutiny of her family\u2019s charitable foundation dogged Clinton\u2019s candidacy until her eventual defeat.\n\nThe investigative work in Secret Empires is sure to have a similar effect if Biden wins the Democratic nomination and challenges Trump next year. But already it\u2019s fueling a national scandal that has congressional Democrats eyeing impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nThe book\u2019s allegations against the Bidens were front and center in Trump\u2019s mind during a now-infamous July phone call with the new president of Ukraine, whom Trump asked to rekindle an official investigation into the elder Biden\u2019s efforts to get the former prosecutor in Kiev fired.\n\nTrump has also credited Schweizer\u2019s work publicly, quoting and name-checking him in a recent tweet going after Biden.\n\nAll the attention has made Schweizer\u2019s book a bestseller once again, as noted by Breitbart News, where he serves as a senior contributor. \u201cSchweizer\u2019s \u2018Secret Empires\u2019 Rockets to #17 on Amazon 1.5 Years After Release,\u201d declared a headline on Sunday.", "description": "In more than a dozen instances, Peter Schweizer\u2019s book \u201cSecret Empires\u201d  appears to have copied complete sentences or large parts of them from other sources.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570060894/191003-markay-peter-schweizer-plagiarism-hero_swugws"}
