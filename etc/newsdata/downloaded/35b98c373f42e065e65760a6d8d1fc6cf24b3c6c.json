This has changed and the change is not one for the better,\" union GMB said.\n\nIt comes as the trade union for staff members prepare to a march outside Asda\u2019s head office in Leeds today to hand deliver thousands of customer letters to Asda\u2019s CEO \u2013 Roger Burnley.\n\nIt'll be followed by a 28,000 strong petition demanding a further review of the clauses that staff told Mirror Money have left them feeling like prisoners.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nAsda workers who declined to sign the new contracts were put on 12 weeks' notice earlier this year.\n\nThe protest is in relation to grocer\u2019s decision to issue their workforce with dismissal letters advising them they will be sacked if they refused to sign a \"one-sided punitive\" new contract.\n\n\"Asda Colleagues are to be sacked upon 3 November due to them having second jobs, having childcare responsibilities and wishing to have a personal life,\" GMB said.\n\nBut a statement from Asda today said comments about \"colleagues being sacked due to commitments outside work are untrue\".\n\nThis period comes to a close on 3 November - when those who've not yet signed, will face termination.\n\nA covering letter provided by Keith Dixon, GMB regional organiser states: \"During discussions with those customers GMB London Region spoke at length upon the way in which Asda Colleagues were being threatened with the sack and are having your \u2018Contract 6\u2019 forced upon them.\n\n\"A contract as you know is flexible purely for Asda\u2019s benefit.\n\n\"This flexibility will clearly provide financial savings for the business and is one of the key parts which the business failed to discuss or disclose during the consultation period. This we feel is underhand and deceives your colleagues.\n\n\"Your customers were disgusted with the way your loyal colleagues are being treated and as such have willingly signed the letters and agreed for them to be presented to you.\n\n\"Most of your customers have included a home address or an email address for you to respond directly. The rest have requested that a response is forwarded to my office.\"\n\n\"You have the power and the authority to correct the direction the business has driven Asda to; however, you have an uphill battle to win back the respect and trust your employees had of Asda.\"\n\nMirror Money put GMB's comments to Asda - which responded with claims that the changes will leave 100,000 workers better off.\n\n\"Whilst we respect the right of the GMB to express its views, the comments from them this morning around Asda colleagues being sacked due to commitments outside work are untrue,\" An Asda spokesperson said.\n\n\"This change represents an investment of over \u00a380m and an increase in real pay for over 100000 of our hourly paid colleagues.\n\n\"Throughout the consultation process on these changes we have taken colleague concerns and feedback from colleague representatives on board and have been clear that we understand our colleagues have responsibilities outside of work and we will always help them balance these with their work life.\n\n\"We have been clear that we don\u2019t want any of our colleagues to leave us and whilst the vast majority of colleagues have chosen to sign the new contract, we continue to have conversations with those who have chosen not to, to try and understand their concerns.\n\n\"It is vital that we make sure we are prepared to adapt to the demands of our market. Change is never easy, but we are determined that Asda remains a sustainable business for its customers and colleagues \u2013 now and in the future.\"", "description": "A long-running dispute over the Walmart-owned supermarket's new employment terms will come to an end next month when those who refused to sign will have their contracts terminated", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Bloomberg", "Daily Record"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11848537.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Wal-Mart-Stores-Incs-UK-Asda-Supermarket-Store-Operations.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
