Her father ascribed her actions to \"nervous troubles\" in an interview with Iranian state media, feeding a portrayal of her as mentally unstable. And yet those who walked the same path to win their right to watch a football match in person know differently. \"The blue girl\", they call Khodayari, draped in Esteghlal's colours and forever a martyr to the systemic exclusion and misogyny that has held sway in Iran since the Islamic Revolution.\n\nWearing her colours proudly, a fan shows her support at the Iran match. Getty Images\n\nSuch is the clerics' omnipotence, even presidents have been overruled in their attempts to roll back the restrictions. When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tried in 2006, voices in the conservative establishment condemned him. \"Women looking at a man's body, even if not for the sake of gratification, is inappropriate,\" decreed Fazel Lankarani, one of the grand ayatollahs. \"Furthermore, Islam insists that men and women should not mix.\"\n\nThe edict was never formally enshrined in law, but Iran's Islamic scholars concluded that women should be kept away from football for fear of glimpsing half-naked male bodies or overhearing crude language. For almost four decades, those risks have been rather outweighed by the likelihood of violent reprisals for any women daring to flout the ban. Still, many have tried. Photographer Forough Alaei has even documented herself doing so, inveigling her way into Persepolis games by bandaging her body and wearing a fake beard.\n\nThe courage required for such disguise can hardly be overstated. In his memoir, Christopher Hitchens, considering who to choose as his heroines in real life, wrote: \"The women of Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, who risk their lives and their beauty to defy the foulness of theocracy.\" One could see his wisdom yesterday in the sight of 3,500 Iranian women filing through the Azadi's turnstiles, incredulous at having overcome the once-insurmountable obstacle of religious intolerance.\n\nFor Fifa, the test now is to see whether the progress can be sustained.\n\nThere is a strong argument that the governing body should have acted far sooner in putting pressure on Iran to change its access rules, or at least before a young woman decided the outlook was so hopeless that she was consumed by fire. Asked whether it had blood on its hands over the death of Khodayari, Fifa dodged the question, saying that its sole focus was on ensuring that women in Iran had free access to matches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a promise to which it should be held. After all, the Iranians have not been above purely symbolic gestures before. In October last year, about 100 women were let in for a home friendly against Bolivia, only for a ban to be reimposed as soon as the world's gaze was turned.\n\nLoading\n\nIn fighting for change, Fifa must be in no doubt as to the power it wields. For it is football, not politics, that has brought about the signs of reform in Iran's gender apartheid. President Trump's threats to strangle the country into submission by economic sanctions have not worked. But when a Fifa delegation told Tehran last month that women had to be granted access to all matches, there was a rapid - if reluctant - response. Only this level of directness cuts through. Football is a significant source of soft power for Iran on the global stage. If Fifa was to threaten the country with punishments that limited its participation in tournaments, it can be sure that the internal reaction would be instant.\n\nNow is the time to strike. In a few days, attention will shift away from Tehran, and the barriers to women attending domestic matches will remain. It is for this reason that Amnesty International fears that yesterday's spectacle was a publicity stunt.\n\nAzadi, the stadium that has at last opened its doors to women, means freedom in Persian. For the sake of Iran's women, Fifa must ensure that such freedom is no longer in name only.\n\nThe Telegraph London", "description": "Given that Iran's highest clerics had spent 38 years imposing a blanket ban on women attending football matches, they were never likely to disavow all remnants of the past in the space of a single World Cup qualifier.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3473%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_200%2C$y_467/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2de9d5469f95ab459066e54d1fee4c3dea52c047", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
