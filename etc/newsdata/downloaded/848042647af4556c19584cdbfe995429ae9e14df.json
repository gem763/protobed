Email webnews@mirror.co.uk.\n\nSources told the Telegraph it is \"very unlikely\" Robinson, from Portadown, knew about any alleged plans to smuggle migrants into the UK.\n\nPolice were investigating a suspected Irish people-smuggling ring with possible links to Bulgaria, the report claimed.\n\nA neighbour of Robinson's parents said he would see his mum and dad every few weeks, telling the Belfast Telegraph: \"His parents are away to England and all.\"\n\nHis father is the manager of Laurelvale FC, a local amateur club in the Mid-Ulster Football League.\n\nPaul Berry, a local councillor, said he spoke to Robinson's dad, Mark, \"a couple of times\" on Wednesday before the father found out about the arrest on social media.\n\nMr Berry told the Belfast Telegraph: \"When I was talking to him nothing had been confirmed to him that it was Mo. The police or nobody of that nature had informed him.\"\n\nHe stressed Mo Robinson was \"innocent until proven guilty\".\n\nThe councillor told PA: \"He had said he had been getting messages via people on social media on what was happening and at that stage it was not confirmed to him or his family that his son had been arrested.\n\n\"In the local area the feeling is one of complete shock and hope this is not a true story in terms of his involvement.\"\n\nMr Berry, who knows the father well, said the family were \"very well respected\" in the area.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe added: \"The local community is hoping that he (Mo Robinson) has been caught up innocently in this matter but that's in the hands of Essex Police, and we will leave it in their professional hands to try to catch the perpetrators of this.\"\n\nHe said the family had been left upset by the \"unwelcome spotlight\" the incident had shone on them.\n\n\"It was very distressing for the family as they just felt they were captive in their own home,\" he said.\n\nIt is believed Robinson picked up the trailer two hours before the migrants were found dead.\n\nTemperatures in the refrigerated container get as low as -25C.\n\nThe trailer had entered England via a freight ferry service from Zeebrugge, Belgium, into Purfleet, Essex, on the River Thames.\n\nBelgian authorities said the container arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm local time on Tuesday and left the Belgian port the same afternoon.\n\nThe ferry docked in Essex just after 12.30am on Wednesday and the lorry left the port in Purfleet about 35 minutes later.\n\nThe tractor that hauled it away from the port had come from from Northern Ireland, according to police.\n\nIt had \"Ireland\" emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message \"The Ultimate Dream\".\n\nThe Bulgarian ministry of foreign affairs said the truck was registered in Varna in Bulgaria \"under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen\".\n\nParamedics were alerted first after the bodies were discovered and Essex Police were notified just after 1.40am.\n\nThe migrants were found dead in the trailer at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays.\n\nBritish authorities are now trying to identify the 39 people who died.\n\nThe lorry was moved to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies can be recovered while preserving the dignity of the victims.\n\nBelgium's federal prosecutor's office has launched its own investigation to find out where the trailer originated and how long it had been in the country.\n\nThe office said it is not yet clear when or where the victims entered the container.\n\nC.RO Ports, which manages the ferry terminals in Zeebrugge and Purfleet said it was \"deeply saddened\" and assisting investigators.\n\nThe incident follows warnings from the National Crime Agency and the Border Force of the increased risk of people-smuggling via Belgium.\n\nSecurity checks for people smuggling are believed to be less stringent at both ports than at Calais and Dover.", "description": "The 25-year-old man, named locally as Mo Robinson, was still being questioned by Essex Police after 39 bodies were found in a refrigerated trailer at an industrial estatae in Grays", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707524.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_THP_CHP_231019SLUG_6899JPG2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
