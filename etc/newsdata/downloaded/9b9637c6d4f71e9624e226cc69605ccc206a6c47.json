U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude\n\nsettled at $56.41 a barrel, down 8 cents, after briefly\n\nturning positive following the Pentagon statement.\n\nCrude futures pared losses late in the session after the\n\nU.S. Department of Defense said it would deploy radar systems,\n\nPatriot missiles and about two hundred personnel to bolster\n\nSaudi Arabia's defenses after an attack on the kingdom's oil\n\nfacilities this month. Details about the deployment clarify the Pentagon's Friday\n\nannouncement about U.S. plans to send more forces to Saudi\n\nArabia after the Sept. 14 strike, which Washington has blamed on\n\nIran.\n\n\"The complex saw a late session rally on reports that the\n\nU.S. was sending military equipment to Saudi Arabia with the\n\nheadlines driving another dose of risk premium into the pricing\n\nstructure,\" said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates.\n\nOil took a hit earlier in the session after the U.S. House\n\nIntelligence Committee released a declassified version of a\n\nwhistleblower report alleging Trump used his office to solicit\n\ninterference in the 2020 presidential election from a foreign\n\ncountry. \"When the odds of impeachment go down, the market goes up.\n\nWhen the odds of impeachment go up, it goes down,\" said Phil\n\nFlynn, an analyst with Price Futures Group in Chicago. \"The\n\nmarket doesn't like the prospect of impeachment - that's going\n\nto be a negative for the U.S. economy, it's going to be a\n\nnegative on U.S.-China trade.\"\n\nPrices were also under pressure by the faster-than-expected\n\nrecovery of Saudi output after the drone and missile strikes on\n\ntwo of its oil-processing plants, as well as a surprise 2.4\n\nmillion-barrel build in U.S. crude inventories last week.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, has restored its\n\nproduction capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day, sources\n\nbriefed on state oil company Saudi Aramco's operations told\n\nReuters. Comments by Trump on Wednesday, which signalled that a\n\nresolution to the U.S. trade dispute with China might be near,\n\nhelped limit losses.\n\nA day after delivering a stinging rebuke to China over its\n\ntrade policies, Trump said Beijing wanted to make a deal and it\n\n\"could happen sooner than you think.\"\n\nTrump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also signed a\n\nlimited trade deal that would open Japanese markets to $7\n\nbillion of U.S. products annually.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 8-Oil steady as Middle East conflict fears support, Trump probe weighs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA740RP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
