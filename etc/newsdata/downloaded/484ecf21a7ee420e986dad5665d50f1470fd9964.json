This is very much one of the smallest and most treasured group, the story of an event that threatened but ultimately failed to destroy hundreds of clubs across the country, is still regularly quoted in legal circles more than 70 years later, and also made 48-year-old Bessie Stone of Cheetham Hill, Manchester really quite upset.\n\nThe story starts on 9 August 1947 when, midway through Denton St Lawrence CC\u2019s away match against Cheetham, Miss Stone left her house on Manchester\u2019s Beckenham Road and stopped for a chat with a neighbour. Meanwhile, over the road, beyond a 7ft fence, down a further 10ft of natural slope and across 75 yards of playing field, a certain Walter Leadbetter, teacher at a Southport school, was batting for the visitors. The bowler\u2019s name has been lost to history, which is probably as he would have wanted it: with one ball of his first and final over of the game remaining, Leadbetter had already hit two sixes and a four. The final delivery was no better than those that had preceded it, and Leadbetter swung his bat, connected sweetly, and sent the ball soaring.\n\nThe Spin | The Hundred sees ECB double down on ludicrous marketing-drivel Read more\n\nThe ball flew over the outfield, it screamed over the boundary, it cleared the fence and it sailed over Beckenham Road before landing, some 98 yards away from Leadbetter\u2019s bat, on Bessie Stone\u2019s head. So it was that when someone arrived to fetch the missing ball, they found it lying next to the prone body of a passing, and passed-out, neighbour.\n\nStone was rushed to Manchester Northern Hospital, where she was treated for shock and concussion. The wound required two stitches, two months\u2019 treatment as an outpatient and the removal of a considerable amount of hair. What remained, Stone said, suddenly turned white. Claiming terrible long-term effects \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m just a bundle of nerves,\u201d she sniffed, nearly two years later \u2013 Stone sued. And suddenly every cricket team, golf course and tennis club within hitting distance of the general public was at risk (or, at the very least, at risk of having to pay for costly insurance policies).\n\nShe came up against a cricket-loving judge at Manchester Assizes, Mr Justice Oliver, who decided against her but, particularly given the lack of precedent on the issue \u2013 which he considered astonishing \u201csince balls are always flying out of all sorts of grounds in all sorts of places\u201d \u2013 he granted leave to appeal.\n\nStone\u2019s case was Cheetham were guilty of negligence and nuisance for allowing humans to roam within six-hitting range\n\nAnd so it was that 70 years ago this week the Court of Appeal in London was hearing evidence about how far WG Grace could throw a cricket ball (about 150 yards, apparently), how far Albert Trott, then as now the only player to have cleared the pavilion at Lord\u2019s, could hit one, and discussing whether that would be a fair way to decide the minimum size of a club\u2019s grounds.\n\nStone\u2019s case was that although Cheetham CC had come into existence in 1864, roughly 85 years before Beckenham Road, they were guilty of negligence and nuisance for allowing innocent humans to roam within six-hitting range. Even though several witnesses insisted that no one at Cheetham had ever struck the ball as far as Leadbetter, such feats were clearly possible, and a near-neighbour of Stone\u2019s \u2013 whose house was closer to the ground \u2013 testified that cricket balls did turn up in his front garden occasionally, even if he couldn\u2019t be quite sure how often. The crux of the argument, and the idea that really scared so many other clubs, was that if it was possible for a ball to be struck out of the ground and hit someone on the head then an offence was committed every time cricket was played, even if the ball remained grounded and heads unhit. \u201cI appreciate that goes a long way and seems to be an attack on cricket but it is the logical conclusion,\u201d Stone\u2019s lawyer insisted.\n\nIt was clear that the case\u2019s importance was not confined to north Manchester, and when two of the three judges sided with Stone the situation was suddenly critical. Cheetham were small and could not afford to fund lengthy legal battles \u2013 particularly having hired the eminent Sir Walter Monckton, who by the time the case concluded was MP for Bristol West and minister of labour as well as being president of Surrey CCC, to represent them \u2013 but neither could they simply accept defeat. To help them, clubs across the country contributed to a fighting fund that was quickly big enough to take the case to the House of Lords.\n\nIn the final battle Monckton successfully convinced the Lords that just because the club knew a ball might bounce into a quiet road in suburban Manchester, it would not be reasonable to expect them to know that it would land on someone\u2019s head. \u201cThe existence of some risk is an ordinary incident of life,\u201d said Lord Porter, in conclusion, \u201ceven when all due care has been \u2013 and it must be \u2013 taken.\u201d Porter suggested that if the Lords found for Stone, it would mean that no one could drive a car or fly an aeroplane, or for that matter undertake any activity that might, however unlikely, result in injury to someone else. \u201cThe remote possibility of injury occurring is not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be sufficient probability to lead a reasonable man to anticipate it.\u201d\n\nSo sport was saved, and Stone ordered to pay costs for both sides, a sum of around \u00a33,000 \u2013 about \u00a395,000 in today\u2019s money. Even though she had dragged her local cricket club through the legal system for four years, she was not minded to do so. \u201cCricketers claim to be sportsmen, and I suggest that as sportsmen they could make a gracious gesture by offering to pay the legal costs they incurred,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they might go even further by paying my legal costs as well. I think I have suffered enough from this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister enjoyed normal health before the cricket ball accident, but her health has declined terribly because of all the worry about these long and expensive legal proceedings,\u201d said her brother Mark. \u201cAbout anything that looks unsportsmanlike the English people instinctively say: \u2018Well, it isn\u2019t cricket.\u2019 And I think it isn\u2019t cricket if the cricketers expect Bessie to pay the whole costs. The money that cricketers up and down the country raised to contest this action is probably adequate to cover the costs of both sides.\u201d\n\nCheetham, the cricket community and all lovers of sport and slight risk had already secured the only victory they needed. They did not force Stone to pay their costs. The case is still regularly quoted in court. In 1952, the year after the case finally concluded, the ball that struck Stone was mounted on an oak plinth and presented to Monckton, a token of every cricketer\u2019s appreciation for his work in ensuring that they should be free to hit the ball as far as they possibly can in the knowledge that while they might end up getting caught, they will not end up in court.\n\n\u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.
