Americans held higher opinions of unions in March 1999 (66%), August 1999 (65%), and August 2003 (65%).\n\n\u201cHigher public support for unions in the past few years likely reflects the relatively good economic conditions in place, particularly low unemployment,\u201d Gallup said in a statement released with its findings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy contrast, the lowest union approval ratings in Gallup history came from 2009 through 2012, years of high unemployment that followed the Great Recession.\u201d\n\nThis year is something of a milestone: It\u2019s the 125th anniversary of Labor Day, a holiday dating back to President Grover Cleveland\u2019s signing in 1894 of a law to create a federal holiday to honor and celebrate the nation\u2019s working people.\n\nGallup noted that over decades of measuring the public\u2019s opinion toward organized labor, from 1936 through 1967, positive attitudes consistently exceeded 60%. From 1967 onward, positive views tracked about 10% lower on average and rarely exceeded 60%.\n\nGallup said Americans of all stripes and political persuasions \u2014 Democrats, Republicans and Independents \u2014 all view unions more favorably than they did at the low point a decade or so ago.\n\n\u201cDemocrats (82%) remain far more likely than Republicans (45%) to approve of unions,\u201d Gallup said, adding that those positive views are double-digits higher than in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet for all the upbeat feeling associated with unions, membership is on a downward spiral, falling by about half over the past 35 years, according to a Pew Research Center fact sheet released on Thursday to coincide with the Labor Day weekend.\n\n\u201cUnion membership peaked in 1954 at nearly 35% of all U.S. workers (excluding the self-employed), but in 2018 the unionization rate was just 10.5%,\u201d wrote Drew DeSilver at Pew.\n\nAccording to figures complied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), union membership dropped by 0.2% to 14.7 million workers last year, little change from 2017. By comparison, however, union membership rate was 20.1% in 1983, the first year for which the BLS has comparable figures, and there were 17.7 million union workers.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the BLS reported that a persistently stubborn wage gap separates some groups of workers from their colleagues. For example, women are paid just 85 cents for every dollar men are paid. White males have a higher median hourly wage ($21) than every other racial, ethnic, or gender subgroup except Asian men ($24).\n\n\u201cThe wage gap between young workers with college degrees and their less-educated counterparts is the widest in decades,\u201d the BLS reported, noting that despite the high cost of college attendance young college graduates fare better than young people with only a high school degree or less.\n\nSpecifically, the bureau found that in the July survey period, only 2.2% of adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher were unemployed, compared to 3.6% for adults with only a high school diploma and 5.1% for adults who didn\u2019t graduate from high school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile unemployment among all groups has fallen since the depths of the Great Recession to levels not seen since the 1960s, it\u2019s still true that the higher someone\u2019s educational attainment is, the more likely they are to have a job.\u201d\n\nAll this job-related data tends to take a backseat to other holiday weekend news that serves as another indicator of the nation\u2019s economy: Labor Day sales.\n\nIt\u2019s only true, of course, if one is well employed enough to take advantage of retailers\u2019 mark-downs, but as USA Today reported recently, \u201cthe glorious long weekend \u2026 also happens to be a fantastic shopping holiday.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-602276154.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
