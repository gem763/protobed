Return on equity in the banking sector is between 11 and 13 per cent and there is a consensus in the market it is headed toward 10 per cent.\n\nThe senior banker\u2019s joke about now being an ideal time to be underweight mortgages draws attention to the more diverse retail and institutional banking businesses of ANZ and NAB. ANZ was this week named by Dealogic as the fourth-largest provider of loans in the Asia-Pacific in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHigher exposure\n\nIt is a good time to have higher exposure to consumer loans, which are about 8 per cent of sector profits and earn return on equity of about 57 per cent according to Matthew Wilson, respected banking analyst at Evans and Partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisruption is hitting the consumer loans market as shown by the forecasts in the Latitude Financial Group prospectus. It has become the third-largest player in consumer lending from the fifth-largest a year ago.\n\nWilson recently explored the problem facing the banks and their shareholders as official interest rates fall, and this was well described in a lengthy note published in September.\n\nHe argues that the big four banks' long-term game of offering new borrowers lower rates than existing borrowers, also known as the \u201cfront book, back book\u201d strategy, does not really work when interest rates head below 1 per cent.\n\nWilson says loyal and long-standing customers are paying about 50 basis points more than they should. The emergence of risk-based pricing for the borrowers stuck in the back book will put about 5 per cent of group profits at risk, according to Wilson.\n\n\u201cBanks are spread (asset and liability) businesses and perform best with a normal cash rate and upward sloping yield curve,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe financial system is built on the premise of the term structure of positive interest rates.\u201d\n\nNormally a lower spread between loans and deposits is offset by higher volume, but experience in Europe and Japan is that lending volumes have declined. In Europe, there is discussion about negative deposit rates for retail bank accounts and government support for increased wholesale funding of bank balance sheets.\n\nThe big four rely on deposits for about 60 to 70 per cent of their funding. Wilson argues that as interest rates and net interest margins are squeezed lower the return on equity at banks falls below 10 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsequently, free cash flow from the same pool of capital invested results in cash dividends collapsing by 28 per cent; with the retail banks most impacted,\u201d Wilson said. He is not alone in predicting declines in bank dividends. Most analysts are warning of dividend cuts in 2020.\n\nInvestors in banks have to get used to return on equity of about 10 per cent or less. But the revenue streams are dependable even if the mortgage back books have to be repriced.\n\nSuper exposed to banks\n\nWhen Prime Minister Scott Morrison accused the banks of profiteering for not passing on the entire 25 basis points rate cut Chanticleer wondered if has a secret desire for the big four to emulate the bank owned by 26 industry super funds, ME Bank.\n\nIts return on equity went backwards last financial year to 7 per cent and after more than 20 years in the banking sector it has not paid a dividend to its owners. Morrison should remember there is one thing worse than a profitable bank and that is one that does not make enough money to maintain its capital.\n\nME Bank is profitable and well capitalised but it fails to justify its existence by delivering acceptable returns to its owners.\n\nMorrison should not forget that the average Australian superannuation account has about 8 to 10 per cent of their savings exposed to the banks because they form such a large part of the stockmarket index.\n\nIn other words, the health of the super system is partly dependent upon a healthy and profitable banking system. It would be a mistake to wash over the strong connection between bank profitability, super savings and government tax revenue.", "description": "The decline in official interest rates will put the spotlight on the strategy of the big four banks to charge loyal customers more for their mortgages than new customers.
