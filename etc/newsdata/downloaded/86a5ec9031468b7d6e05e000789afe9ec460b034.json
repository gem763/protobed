Low-income countries included: Tanzania, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Middle-income countries consisted of Iran, South Africa, Philippines, Colombia, China, Brazil, Malaysia, Turkey, Poland, Argentina and Chile. And the richest countries included were Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Sweden and Canada. (There was no accurate estimated income for Palestine, another country that was included, researchers noted).\n\nThe study found that cardiovascular disease is still the major cause of 40% of deaths globally, however, death from cancer kills twice as many people as heart disease in high-income countries.\n\nMedicines to treat high cholesterol and blood-pressure in wealthier countries have helped lower heart disease-related mortality rates in the past few years, scientists noted. Gilles Dagenais, lead author on the study, and a professor at Quebec\u2019s Laval University in Canada, explained that higher rates of death from heart disease in lower income countries could be the result of poor quality health care or less access to treatment.\n\nCancer could soon be the No. 1 cause of death globally, researchers noted.\n\n\u201cAs cardiovascular disease decreases in many countries, mortality from cancer will probably become the leading cause of death. The high mortality in poorer countries is not related to risk factors, but it might be related to poorer access to health care,\u201d the study claimed.\n\nThe United States was not featured in the research, but heart disease and cancer have both been the primary and secondary causes of death in America, responsible for 46% of deaths in the U.S., according to Healthline.com.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSpending on cancer treatments in the U.S. has surged from $26.8 billion to $42.1 billion between 2011 and 2016, the highest-ranked treatment area in specialty drug spending, according to a separate study published in the Journal of Oncology Practice last year.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "People living in higher earning countries like Sweden, Argentina and Canada are more likely to die from cancer than a cardiovascular disease like a heart attack, according to new research.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"}
