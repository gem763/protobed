Too bad they don\u2019t have any better ideas.", "language": "en", "text": "The 2020 Democratic candidates all hate President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China. They also seem to have no real idea what they would do instead.\n\nAt least, they didn\u2019t have any great answers onstage during Thursday\u2019s 2020 debate in Houston. When it came to questions on US-China relations, trade negotiations, and tariffs, candidates were quick to condemn Trump\u2019s strategy. But when it came to delivering their plans on how to handle China, the candidates sounded a bit like, well, Trump.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg both slammed Trump for the fallout from his trade war; Yang noted the suffering of farmers and Buttigieg said Trump\u2019s inability to deal and work with our allies hurt America\u2019s standing.\n\nBut Yang also said he wouldn\u2019t remove those tariffs immediately. \u201cWe have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that\u2019s had victims on both sides,\u201d Yang said. \u201cSo, no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, too, said he would include tariffs as \u201cleverage\u201d as part of his strategy, as opposed to Trump\u2019s all-in approach on tariffs.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MI) said she wouldn\u2019t have put the tariffs in place on China (she broadly defended steel tariffs, though not against our allies). But her suggestion was basically, well, to keep talking. \u201cWhat I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiate table, that\u2019s what I would,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro essentially said the same. \u201cWhen I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war. We have leverage there,\u201d he said, without saying how he\u2019d do it or what leverage the US has.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also said the US had to \u201chold China accountable\u201d for its unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. Former Vice President Joe Biden, too, said that the US had to set the rules or \u201cwe\u2019re going to find ourselves with China setting the rules.\u201d\n\nAll of which is exactly what Trump says he\u2019s trying to do. And not doing particularly well, if the jitters over a recession and the frustrations of America\u2019s farmers are any guide.\n\nThis slate of Democrats, on the whole, has shown that they\u2019re fairly sympathetic to the protectionist policies this administration has pursued. Klobuchar largely defended steel tariffs on Thursday (albeit not ones applied to our allies), and Warren blasted America\u2019s trade deals for hurting America\u2019s workers, which is a line straight from the current president.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews wrote on Thursday, \u201cbasically no one spoke up for free trade as it\u2019s been traditionally pursued by presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nDebates are debates, so expecting a multi-pronged plan on US-China trade is unreasonable. But in an area where Democrats could successfully challenge Trump, they\u2019re struggling to say what success with China would look like.", "description": "Thursday\u2019s debate showed that candidates are struggling to define a China trade policy to counter Trump\u2019s.", "authors": ["Jen Kirby", "Anya Van Wagtendonk", "Anna North", "Li Zhou", "Emily Todd Vanderwerff", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/in295FQd4VoWxJG8LokeoktOQWA=/0x486:5063x3137/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19196151/1174331245.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
