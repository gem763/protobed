They are: Polish novelist Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian Peter Handke.\n\nIn other news: Next week, it will have been 50 years since Caravaggio\u2019s Nativity was stolen from the Oratory of Saint Lawrence in Palermo. Have the police been chasing red herrings all this time?\n\nThe Mona Lisa is back in its old spot at the Louvre, and a new \u201cqueuing system promises shorter waiting times and a more intimate experience with Leonardo\u2019s celebrated oil-on-poplar painting, the museum insists.\u201d\n\nThe crisis in psychiatry: \u201cAnne Harrington begins Mind Fixers with a fairy tale. Once upon a time, psychiatry (or at least German psychiatry) rightly saw mental illness as rooted in biology, more specifically in the brain. Its laboratories developed new ways of slicing and dicing brains, and new techniques to stain and fix slices of brain tissue as it sought the sources of craziness. Then Freud came along and turned people\u2019s heads. Talk of egos and ids, Oedipus and the unconscious, of murdered memories and hidden meanings, seduced generation after generation, luring psychiatry off into a \u2018scientific wasteland\u2019 and condemning sufferers to analysis terminable and interminable. From this nightmare, we suddenly awoke in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Advances in genetics, neuroscience and psychopharmacology all at once reminded psychiatrists that biology ruled, that talk could be dispensed with, and a truly medical psychiatry could finally emerge . . . Like all good fairy stories, this one has a happy ending. It is a fantasy, Harrington immediately asserts \u2013 indeed, deeply wrong \u2013 in every particular. It wasn\u2019t the siren song of psychoanalysis that heralded the demise of German biological psychiatry; it was its own failures. Further, psychoanalysis did not replace it all at once. Analysis rose to prominence and dominance only after the Second World War. And Freudianism did not fall \u2018because science triumphed over dogmatism\u2019. The \u2018science\u2019 has turned out to be remarkably thin. Psychiatry continues to rely not on biological markers of disease but on clusters of clinical symptoms. Its vaunted diagnostic process is, in the words of a recent director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Thomas Insel, \u2018equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever\u2019. That problem is now obvious.\u201d\n\nDominic Green laments the decline of American arts: \u201cEverything is derivative and nostalgic. Nothing of note happened in painting or dance \u2014 or criticism, because the task of the American critic is to write obituaries and rewrite press releases. In music, Taylor Swift, once the Great White Hope of a dying industry, emitted a scrupulously bland album by committee. The jazz album of the year was, as it was last year, a studio off cut from John Coltrane, who died in 1967. The show, or what remained of it, was stolen by Lizzo, an obese but self-affirming squawker who, befitting an age of irony and multi-tasking, is the first person to twerk and play the flute at the same time. Meanwhile at the Alamo of high culture, 87-year-old John Williams marked the Tanglewood Festival\u2019s 80th anniversary by perpetrating selections from Star Wars and Saving Private Ryan for an audience of equally geriatric and tasteless boomers.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nIn The New York Review of Books, Adam Kirsch surveys the work of Minae Mizumura:\n\n\u201cThe writer from an immigrant background who exchanges his or her ancestral language for English is an American literary archetype. From Henry Roth, who arrived in Brooklyn in the 1900s from what is now Ukraine, to Junot D\u00edaz, who came to New Jersey in the 1970s from the Dominican Republic, these writers often tell tales of alienation and hardship, but they also reinforce the idea, sometimes even despite themselves, that America is the land of the future\u2014a place where people come to be remade, with all the gains and losses that process involves.\n\n\u201cBut this model of what it means to be an immigrant writer may be breaking down in the twenty-first century. From Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Americanah to Mohsin Hamid\u2019s The Reluctant Fundamentalist to Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s The Sympathizer, some of the most accomplished twenty-first-century English-language novelists explore globalized and diasporic lives that self-consciously resist Americanization. Jhumpa Lahiri, whose stories about Bengali families in New England bridge the gap between these older and newer models of immigrant writing, has recently turned to writing in Italian, hoping, she told The New Yorker, \u2018to free my work from geographic co\u00f6rdinates, and to arrive at a more abstract sense of place.\u2019\n\n\u201cMost subversive of all, however, is the writer who has the chance to become American and write in the American language but deliberately rejects it. That is the story of Minae Mizumura, a distinguished Japanese novelist who has made her ambivalent feelings about English a central theme of her work.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhotos: Moving Hasankeyf\n\nForthcoming:\n\nFlannery O\u2019Connor, Good Things Out of Nazareth: The Uncollected Letters of Flannery O\u2019Connor and Friends, edited by Ben Alexander (Convergent, October 15): \u201cA literary treasure of over one hundred unpublished letters from National Book Award-winning author Flannery O\u2019Connor and her circle of extraordinary friends.\u201d Available at Amazon.\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
