Before being injured, he had racked up 28 saves, third-most in the National League.\n\nDoolittle asked manager Dave Martinez to use him in lower-leverage situations as he works his way back to 100%, and Martinez was on board.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018In order for us to be super effective, we need you to be that guy again, but we\u2019ll get there,\u2019\u201d Martinez said. \u201c\u2018But let\u2019s just take baby steps. You\u2019re doing good, you\u2019re healthy. Just got to go ahead and build you back up.\u2019\u201d\n\nMartinez said Doolittle would be available for the Nationals\u2019 game Sunday against the Miami Marlins.\n\nZimmerman \u2014 who missed 36 games with another bout of plantar fasciitis in his right foot and has not played for Washington since July 21 \u2014 apparently \u201creintroduced\u201d himself to Martinez Sunday, and Martinez and some players joked that the 34-year-old vet was a September call-up.\n\n\u201cZim\u2019s a consummate professional. He gets it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI told him, \u2018You\u2019re going to play against some lefties. You\u2019re gonna come off the bench.\u2019 His defense is still really good \u2026 He understands that we have other guys that are having an unbelievable year, and he gets it. He just wants to be part of it, and I want him to be part of it.\u201d\n\nHellickson was on the 60-day injured list with a right shoulder strain, while the other three were on the 10-day injured list. He and Voth each spent time in Washington\u2019s No. 5 starter role earlier in the year, to varying results, but Martinez said both of them will serve as \u201clong men\u201d out of the bullpen for now.\n\nMLB rosters expand from 25 players to 40 at the start of September each year, so the Nationals did not have to send any players down to the minors to return Doolittle, Zimmerman, Voth and Hellickson. Washington also called up catcher Raudy Read, infielder Adrian Sanchez and outfielder Andrew Stevenson to join the major league roster.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
