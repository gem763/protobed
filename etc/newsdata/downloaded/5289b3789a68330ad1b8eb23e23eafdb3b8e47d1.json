We\u2019re more used to the pastel-coloured agonies of Anton Chekhov\u2019s tragicomedies.\n\nBut Maxim Gorky\u2019s black farce Vassa, written in 1910, has a much rougher, more proletarian swagger.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure rookie director Tinuke Craig knows how to handle it in Mike Bartlett\u2019s adaptation starring Siobhan Redmond.\n\nRedmond, despite her last-minute addition to the cast, has a good stab at Vassa. Like Irn Bru, she\u2019s made in Scotland. From girders. But it\u2019s a role with little variation, and even less empathy\n\nRedmond came late to the show after Samantha Bond pulled out of rehearsals, on doctor\u2019s orders, because of a back injury.\n\nShe is the play\u2019s titular matriarch, who is trying to save her middle-class family from debt. The story opens with the impending death of the family\u2019s paterfamilias, who\u2019s been breathing his last for . . . five weeks.\n\nBartlett, best known for writing TV\u2019s Doctor Foster, updates Gorky with the usual modern profanities.\n\nAt the heart of the story (if it has such an organ), is Vassa, who bins the velvet glove and rules her family with an iron fist.\n\nMost alarmingly, for modern sensibilities, Vassa dismisses one son, who is disabled, as \u2018a freak\u2019; and another as a lazy \u2018fatso\u2019, who\u2019s found an even bigger wife.\n\nThe most sympathetic character, Michael Gould\u2019s lothario uncle, is having an affair with his nephew\u2019s wife. Oh yes, and one of the servants hangs herself. Anyone laughing yet?\n\nCraig\u2019s production tries to play down this brutalism with a multi-ethnic cast, for what would surely have been a mono-ethnic family of knuckle-dragging in-breds.\n\nRussian comedy may be too hard-core for modern tastes. We\u2019re more used to the pastel-coloured agonies of Anton Chekhov\u2019s tragicomedies\n\nFly Davis\u2019s design also seeks to render it more tasteful, with oddly anachronistic, Soviet-style brown formica doors opening onto a carpeted bear-pit arena.\n\nRedmond, despite her last-minute addition to the cast, has a good stab at Vassa. Like Irn Bru, she\u2019s made in Scotland. From girders. But it\u2019s a role with little variation, and even less empathy.\n\nHer eventual emotional breakdown comes completely out of the blue, and would be a tough ask for any actor. Gorky\u2019s character is probably just too mean for Redmond\u2019s warmer ways.\n\nGertrude bell was one of those daughters of the British Empire of whom we can be justly proud. She was an explorer and archaeologist who travelled round the world \u2014 twice \u2014 and set up The Baghdad Antiquities Museum in 1926 (now the Iraq Museum).\n\nWith a CV like hers, it must have been possible to give a colourful account of her life.\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company has, however, opted for Hannah Khalil\u2019s dry and dutiful presentation of Bell\u2019s work.\n\nThe museum caused cultural disputes at the time, became known as Saddam\u2019s gift shop, was looted in the Iraq war and reopened in 2006 amid renewed political and cultural tension.\n\nBell is shown dividing Mesopotamian spoils with the British Museum at the flip of a coin, while keeping the remainder to give to the newly formed Iraqi nation.\n\nEighty years later, after the 2003 Anglo-American invasion, the new boss of the museum is shown fighting similar battles before returning to London.\n\nPreferring to teach post-colonial theory rather than dramatise the action, the play focuses on Bell\u2019s opinions on the proper excavation of national treasures versus imperial plundering.\n\nWe are solemnly reminded colonialism was bad, and that men have been misogynists for, oh, at least four-and-a-half thousand years.\n\nEmma Fielding is decent and diligent as Bell; Rendah Heywood, as her 2006 successor Ghalia Hussein, comes across as tetchy, high-handed and stressed out.\n\nIronically, much the best character is a cheerfully colonialist male: David Birrell, as Bell\u2019s hearty archaeological friend and rival Leonard Woolley.\n\nErica Whyman\u2019s production creates atmosphere with regional music and tasteful special effects, including a dust storm in an empty display cabinet. But that miniature hurricane also, I fear, serves as a metaphor for the show itself: blustery and dry.\n\nA tasty pick and mix of little gems\n\n[BLANK] (Donmar Warehouse)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: A fascinating surprise\n\nIt\u2019s 40 years since Clean Break, an all-women theatre company, started from a drama workshop led by prisoners.\n\nIt concentrates on inequalities and illogicalities in the justice system, and how female imprisonment \u2014 often for small offences, and for only a few months \u2014 wrecks families.\n\nDon\u2019t shudder and turn away: these shows are dramatic and surprising, rather than preachy guilt-trips, because they reflect real people: flawed, confused, but often trying harder than most of us have to.\n\nThis collection of 30 playlets (don\u2019t panic . . . many are very short) by Alice Birch is fragmented, not every story finished.\n\nIt reflects the precariousness of these lives, and the hard task of those who deal with the victims of neglect, addiction, abuse, coercion, mental collapse and nihilistic rage.\n\nFifteen actors move through its bare two hours: offenders, mothers, children, a grandmother, fosterers, sex workers, officials (who are not caricatured as villains).\n\nThere are moments of lyrical beauty, sincerity, and dark jokes.\n\nWell-known performers such as Ayesha Antoine and Jackie Clune mesh brilliantly with newcomers, like the fierce Zaris-Angel Hator and a terrifying tot played by Taya Tower, who wrecks a dinner table with a baseball bat. The effect on children is always there, in these stories.\n\nThe only lengthy sequence is a middle-class dinner party with a journalist, lawyer, two teachers and a police officer, visited by their friendly cocaine dealer and finally, tremendously, exposed for their liberal hypocrisy by a poorer outsider.\n\nIt\u2019s too long, but maybe worthwhile for the realisation these people are as much the problem as the struggling women on the edge of the law.\n\nThere is something exhilarating, despite the sadness, in seeing these stories executed so elegantly: Maria Aberg directs, Rosie Elnile designs a two-tier set mixing intimate domestic spaces with a wide dangerous world below; sometimes close-up videos of faces remind us that this is about private inner battles as well as systems. It\u2019s fascinating.\n\nLibby Purves\n\nBack with a touch of class\n\nTranslations (National Theatre, Olivier)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Lovely language, but slightly\n\nRapturous reviews greeted Ian Rickman\u2019s production of Brian Friel\u2019s Translations at the National last year, so back it has come, with some of the original cast.\n\nYou can see why the play was a hit. The set is a makeshift schoolroom surrounded by turf sods, but the greater part is the sky, like a Paul Henry painting that is seven-eighths cloud.\n\nIt\u2019s an Irish hedge school, where, Hugh, a dipsomaniac classics lover, played with dignified aplomb by Ciaran Hinds, educates the peasantry. His students include fellow Greek and Latin scholar, Jimmie Jack \u2014 lovable Dermot Crowley. Both class acts.\n\nFriel\u2019s play with language is dazzling, but Translations, 40 years on, shows its age. The Irish get all the breaks, moral and comic and is it likely two English officers wouldn\u2019t know Latin? Or that an officer would try to join a village girl at the crossroads for a dance?\n\nBut it\u2019s 1833, a world that\u2019s going to change when a new national school is set up and English soldiers arrive, to measure for an Ordnance Survey map.\n\nWe meet stuck-up Captain Lancey (Rufus Wright) and shy Lieutenant Yolland (Jack Bardoe). They don\u2019t speak Irish, the locals don\u2019t speak much English and the Brits have no Latin.\n\nSo the officers have to rely on schoolmaster\u2019s son Owen \u2014 the engaging Fra Fee \u2014 to be linguistic intermediary, and to rebaptise the place names of his landscape with Yolland.\n\nHe is not only in love with Ireland, but with Maire (Judith Roddy), who\u2019s already engaged. They communicate through the recitation of place names.\n\nFriel\u2019s play with language is dazzling, but Translations, 40 years on, shows its age.\n\nThe Irish get all the breaks, moral and comic and is it likely two English officers wouldn\u2019t know Latin?\n\nOr that an officer would try to join a village girl at the crossroads for a dance?\n\nAnd I think we can work out the connection to the Troubles without the point being rammed home.\n\nMelanie McDonagh\n\nCyrano (Old Vic, Bristol)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: The winner, by a nose\n\nThis is the best nasal prosthesis I\u2019ve yet seen in Cyrano de Bergerac, Edmond de Rostand\u2019s bittersweet comedy about the French musketeer, lover and lyricist inhibited by an unusually large conk.\n\nThis Bristol Old Vic hooter is a work of art: fine, faintly translucent latex-rubber. Blood seems to supply it, and it also seems capable of giving a satisfying blast. But its very best feature is that it doesn\u2019t upstage Tristan Sturrock\u2019s wistful turn as the lovelorn poet.\n\nTom Morris\u2019s delightful new production of the play is part Ealing Comedy (complete with bearded nuns), but he perfectly matches the language of love with the language of theatrical make-believe.\n\nTi Green\u2019s design uses little more than A-frame ladders, bits of scaffold and an upright piano, plus a big fat harvest moon to weave its magic.\n\nMost audaciously, it\u2019s an almost entirely middle-aged cast; but they, too, are well matched to the story of lost love and youth. Even the school posse behind me was entranced.\n\nAnd who can blame them? Sturrock\u2019s silver-haired Cyrano has the flickering eyes of a nervous teenager.\n\nAn uncertain palm rubs his knee in hope of inspiration or courage before he leaps, tragically, into a flurry of words or swords.\n\nTragically \u2014 for his seductive verse is in the service of pretty-boy rival Christian, for whom his beloved Roxanne has fallen.\n\nBut Sturrock seems to relish the subterfuge as much as he rues it, and is transported by it.\n\nThe play may be too long, at nearly three hours, and it can feel overblown (forgive the pun).\n\nBut there\u2019s a lack of affectation about Peter Oswald\u2019s translation that wooed me. It\u2019s a joy to hear the play given a visceral, even spiritual translation by a real-life poet mixing 17th-century and modern idiom.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Sturrock who flies with it. Sara Powell gives Roxanne personality as well as an attentive ear, and Felix Hayes is a pompous peacock fanning his linguistic tail feathers as Cyrano\u2019s other rival, De Guiche.\n\nNor does the show shy away from a sentimental sigh, with a melancholy refrain on piano echoed by yearning violin \u2014 timed to flow from Cyrano\u2019s quill as he writes his billets-doux.\n\nPatrick Marmion", "description": "PATRICK MARMION: Russian comedy may be too hard-core for modern tastes.
