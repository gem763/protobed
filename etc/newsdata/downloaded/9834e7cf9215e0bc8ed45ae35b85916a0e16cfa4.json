If I feel sad, I wear sexy and bright colours to boost my mood. I rock whatever comes to mind. But, on red carpets I have Arato, my designer by my side,\u201d says the actress.\n\nREAD MORE: \u201cI want to have an impact greater than I can fathom,\u201d - Peal Thusi\n\nShe shares her beauty skincare routine and admits she gets regular skin breakouts, but there is nothing a few litres of water cannot cure. \u201cI try to eat organic food as much as I can and I make my fruit and veggie smoothies with lots of water. Another secret is that I do not sleep on pillows. Apart from the fact that they are uncomfortable to sleep on, I hate the oil and dirt they collect,\u201d she says.\n\nHer acting career started with a few eKasi, Our Stories a few years ago but it was on SABC1\u2019s variety show, Selimathunzi that she became a recognisable face back in 2016. She's also previously worked with various brands including Swarovski, Revlon and Daniel Wellington.\n\nREAD MORE: Skeem Saam couple Rachel and Marothi talk about their controversial onscreen love story\n\nShe is still adjusting to the public attention she has been getting ever since she joined Isithembiso in 2017. \u201cI will probably get to a point where I am used to the attention. It feels weird that I am known by a lot of people and my life is no longer private. I appreciate the love though,\u201d says Nolo.\n\nThough she isn't new to the fame game, she is still stunned at what comes with being a public figure. \u201cI get DM\u2019s from people talking about my weight gain. My body is changing because I am growing and there is nothing, I can do about it. So, I have learned to accept growth and embrace it as it comes,\" she shares. \u201cI'm very good at ignoring people who are saying things that are not pleasing to my ears. On a good day, I just laugh it off but on some days it upsets me a bit.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Nomzamo, Bonang and Thuso: Here are our favourite looks from SA stars who are working in the U.S. right now\n\nEven though she is portraying the role of a daddy\u2019s girl, Nolo says she is a mommy\u2019s girl all the way and has no idea what a daddy\u2019s girl is. However, her on-screen father Banzi (Hamilton Dlamini) helps her a lot by sharing about his relationship with his daughter.\n\nNolo is hardly ever seen at events. \u201cI am very picky about the events I go to,\u201d says Nolo.\n\nWith her journey in the entertainment industry, she has learnt that the show can go on without you, no matter how big you are. So, one needs to be kind, respectful, authentic and willing to help others.\n\nSign up to W24's newsletters so you don't miss out on any of out hot stories and giveaways.", "description": "A new age of young, talented stars is taking over the entertainment industry, and one of them is Nolo Seabi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9515/ffb39d6b67f1433aa4bbf21e3234cecf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
