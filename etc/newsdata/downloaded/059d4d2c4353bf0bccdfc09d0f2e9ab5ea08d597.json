The present moral panic was triggered by a long message from Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, to James Forsyth, political editor of The Spectator.\n\nThe message said, \u201cThe negotiations will probably end this week\u201d, and blamed Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister. It said that if he rejected the latest proposal, and Boris Johnson won an election, the plan would be dead and Ireland would end up worse off with a no-deal Brexit.\n\nForsyth didn\u2019t say it was Cummings, just that it was from \u201ca contact in No 10\u201d, but the unrestrained language and the length (800 words) made it as hard to identify the culprit as if we were looking at a toddler\u2019s face covered in chocolate.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It wasn\u2019t clear whether Cummings\u2019 message had helped or hindered this breakthrough, but it undoubtedly helped journalists to understand the thinking of the prime minister\u2019s main adviser.\n\nSo what is the fuss about? I think it is mainly a reflex that assumes the government is manipulating the media by secret means, a belief that is as old as time. But as everyone assumed it was Cummings, this particular example wasn\u2019t very secret.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In my view, this is a minor sharp practice in which the Labour Party engages as much as the government. Labour press officers sometimes ask to be quoted as \u201ca source\u201d rather than as someone speaking officially for the party or for Jeremy Corbyn. This means their bosses cannot be held to account for what they say.\n\nJill Rutter, a former civil servant, says that when government special advisers do this it allows them to avoid the rules about their conduct. There is a code for special advisers \u2013 political appointees who act as temporary civil servants \u2013 that says, among other things, that they are not allowed to engage in personal attacks, but if they are quoted as \u201csources\u201d, no one knows if they\u2019ve done it. Unless they are Cummings sending 800-word text messages to The Spectator.\n\nRutter\u2019s concern is high-minded but unenforceable. People have always told journalists things anonymously. If we agree with the outcome, such as bringing Richard Nixon down over Watergate, it is all about protecting sources and investigative journalism and free speech. If we disagree with the outcome, such as Cummings winding up opponents of a no-deal Brexit by suggesting, anonymously, that the prime minister will not obey the law, it\u2019s an outrageous abuse of power.\n\nAll it is is news. If a source tells a journalist something that makes an interesting story, which would sell papers in the old days or drive web traffic now, we\u2019ll publish it if we think it is true and not libellous. And if the source asks not to be identified, we will usually decide that it is better for the public to know than for the story not to be published at all.\n\nOnce upon a time, the relationship between politicians and Westminster journalists might have been too friendly, but the rules were changed. One of the biggest changes was when briefings by the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson were put on the record and published by the government \u2013 a change made by Alastair Campbell, when he worked for Tony Blair.\n\nYet he is remembered as an arch-practitioner of the dark arts of \u201cspin\u201d. And of course, he was sometimes an anonymous source. He has never quite admitted saying Gordon Brown had to get a grip on his \u201cpsychological flaws\u201d, but everyone knew it was him then just as everyone knows what Cummings is up to now.\n\nThe relevant questions to ask are: Is it true? And, does the public have the right to know? Not, why won\u2019t this journalist name their source?", "description": "Westminster is having one of its fits of indignation about anonymous sources.
