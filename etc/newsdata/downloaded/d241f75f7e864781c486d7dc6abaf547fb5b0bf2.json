This would mean Parliament losing its anti-Brexit edge, and hence its ability to keep delaying Britain\u2019s withdrawal itself.\n\nElection Looks Likely as Labour\u2019s Corbyn Said He Will Back PM\u2019s Proposal https://t.co/kHvGzdVOrB \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 29, 2019\n\nSpeaking in the debate ahead of the Tuesday evening vote which will decide whether an election indeed happens this year or not, several ploys to adjust the electorate deciding the future of the United Kingdom in that vote emerged, in an apparent bid to engineer an anti-Brexit election outcome.\n\nFirst was the demand of Britain\u2019s third party the Liberal Democrats to change the day of the election \u2014 a demand received as a cynical move to make sure more of their supporters would vote.\n\nSince the 1930s, elections in the United Kingdom have always been held on Thursdays \u2014 a convention now enshrined in law \u2014 a practice in contrast to continental Europe where they are generally held on Sundays.\n\nBut because of the onset of the Christmas vacation for students, holding an election on a Thursday rather than a Tuesday within the same mid-December week would mean many would have gone home to their parents or on holidays. This, it is reported Lib Dem strategists worry, would reduce their turnout in key university town seats where they perform well.\n\nLib Dems, SNP Push for December 9th Election to Stop Boris #Brexit Deal Being Passed https://t.co/wfS7dvL6we \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 27, 2019\n\nWhile major constitutional changes tend to be debated at length and pursued with caution, the prospect of a snap election which pollsters say would deliver a majority for the Conservatives has also prompted calls among left-leaning Members of Parliament to push for the largest change in the electorate itself in generations.\n\nAmong other submitted amendments that could have been selected for the election-triggering vote Tuesday night are lines that would have seen children and foreign citizens get the vote in national elections for the first time. Labour spokesman Richard Burgon said Tuesday morning as Labour\u2019s about-face on opposing the election was revealed: \u201cWe\u2019ll be pushing to get votes for 16-year-olds, we\u2019ll be pushing to allow EU nationals who can vote in other elections to be able to vote in this general election.\u201d\n\nLowering the voting age to 16 was in the 2017 Labour party manifesto, but the party lost that election and was not able to implement the policy.\n\nThe calls were subsequently discussed in Parliament and could have been voted on Tuesday evening, but were not selected by deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle, increasing the chance of the election vote going ahead.\n\n.@RichardBurgon says Labour will be 'pushing' for both 16 year olds and EU nationals to be able to vote in a pre-Christmas general election.

And with free movement and general elections at different times, one can see why that might be.\n\n\u201cLooking at international norms\u2026 the United Nations of which we are part sees 18 as an adult. Refugees are seen as children if they are under 18 years old\u2026 All EU member states apart from Austria allow votes only from 18.\u201d\n\nIt has been frequently argued by anti-Brexit campaigners that the 2016 referendum was unfairly won because it did not consult children who, so the claim goes, will live longest and therefore be impacted longest by the outcome. Dr Johnson tackled this claim as well, as it was being made to argue for children voting in the snap election, remarking: \u201cThe point was made that our children should have a vote because it matters to their future.\n\n\u201cIt matters to my four, eight, and 12-year-old\u2019s futures even more, but that is not a rational argument for them to vote. I am concerned about these amendments being potentially put forward being wrecking amendments because what they are doing is trying to change the franchise just before the election.\u201d\n\nBoJo Tells Corbyn to \u2018Man Up\u2019, Even the \u2018Commies\u2019 Want an Election https://t.co/foDtHOyc9u \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 25, 2019\n\nThe Prime Minister himself also rejected the notion of changing who is entitled to vote. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said of the proposals Tuesday: \u201c18 is widely recognised as the age people become an adult. Below the age of 18 you are treated as a minor in both the foster care system and the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cFull citizenship rights including voting should be gained at adulthood\u2026 It would also mean EU nationals in the UK enjoy wider voting rights than UK nationals in any other country other than Ireland.\n\n\u201cCitizenship requirements are the norm in national elections in democracies, including in the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThis story is developing and more follows", "description": "Members of Britain's Parliament moved to make a last-minute three-million strong extension to the electorate itself as the nation faces a Brexit-forward snap general election, potentially within weeks.", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1145566873-e1572371725372-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
