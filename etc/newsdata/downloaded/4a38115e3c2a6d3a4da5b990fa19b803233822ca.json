Biden. He also engaged in a feud with Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican, who has criticized the president\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cNot only are the Do Nothing Democrats interfering in the 2020 Election, but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 Election. They must be stopped!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nThe former speaker sat down with The Washington Times to discuss impeachment during a leadership summit in Japan sponsored by the Universal Peace Federation, at which he delivered a keynote address. Mr. Gingrich said the president is understandably resentful of the impeachment inquiry after special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s long-running investigation found no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the great dangers he faces,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s now been through three years of this. And it does wear on you. If you\u2019re president, there does get to be a point where you wonder how are you supposed to cope with this.\u201d\n\nBut he believes Mr. Trump will emerge in a stronger position to win reelection, and he views Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, as the president\u2019s most likely opponent as Mr. Biden grapples with his own Ukraine controversy.\n\nMr. Gingrich said the impeachment effort has fired up the Republican base like nothing he has ever seen.\n\n\u201cFor the first time really in my lifetime, you have an aroused conservative base out there that wants a fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are totally prepared to go to the mat. If you look at the initial [Republican] fundraising reaction, it seems to me that Trump\u2019s base is reacting a lot stronger than [Democrats\u2019] base. And I think that makes it much more dangerous for the Democrats.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s reelection effort raised $45 million online in the third quarter, fueled by 313,000 first-time donors and a big spike in small-dollar donations. The online donations, part of an overall haul of $125 million by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, rose 29% over the second quarter.\n\nAsked whether he believes Democrats will succeed in impeaching Mr. Trump, Mr. Gingrich replied, \u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime you\u2019re willing to commit suicide, you can get a lot done,\u201d he said, adding that Speaker Nancy Pelosi is endangering Democrats in pro-Trump districts \u201cwho are going to lose their seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at [Rep. Collin C.] Petersen in Minnesota \u2014 a 30-point Trump district,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s rural. It\u2019s the kind of district where people just look at this stuff and think it\u2019s all garbage.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats consider the impeachment of Mr. Clinton more than 20 years ago as the same sort of partisan-motivated effort that Republicans say Mr. Trump now faces. Mr. Gingrich said the two cases have significant differences.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s not an impeachment,\u201d he said of the investigation of Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a coup. There\u2019s no characteristic comparable to impeachment.\u201d\n\nMr. Clinton was impeached for lying under oath and obstruction of justice, charges that arose from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones. The impeachment was preceded by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr\u2019s report to Congress, which substantiated allegations of perjury and obstruction.\n\n\u201cStarr listed 11 things that he believes Clinton\u2019s guilty of, each of which is impeachable,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cSo we were faced with a report from a reasonably competent person who uses the word \u2018guilty.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said Republicans during Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment established procedural rules, including allowing subpoena power for the minority party.\n\n\u201cUntil [Democrats] actually vote for the process and they actually set up a set of rules, this is just a bunch of politicians on a witch hunt,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re proposing on two levels is crazy. One is that the Congress can override executive privilege randomly on fishing expeditions. And the other is that any foreign government leader who speaks with an American president needs to be aware that whatever he or she says may be captured by the Democratic Congress. It\u2019s about as deep a hit on national security as you can get.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans who participated in Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment now view it differently. Former Rep. Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who helped draft the articles of impeachment and voted to impeach Mr. Clinton, said the accusations against Mr. Trump are more troubling. He said Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged \u201cquid pro quo\u201d communications with Ukraine \u2014 the president was withholding military aid, a matter not discussed in the call \u2014 are more relevant to the operations of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThe allegations against President Trump are really far more serious. They involve abuse of power, abuse of the office,\u201d Mr. Inglis said Saturday on Fox News. \u201cI think in retrospect it was a mistake to impeach Bill Clinton because the substance of the matter really wasn\u2019t all that essential to the nation. In retrospect, I think it really didn\u2019t go to the heart of the operation of the United States. What we\u2019re dealing here with President Trump does go to the heart of American foreign policy and to the heart of the office. I think we [House Republicans] were sort of blinded by our dislike of President Clinton. In retrospect, I wish we hadn\u2019t done it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Clinton was impeached, the Senate failed to muster the necessary two-thirds majority to remove him from office, and he completed his second term.\n\nMr. Trump and his allies are targeting Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, as the partisan leader of the impeachment probe. Many in Mr. Trump\u2019s camp also believe they have nearly succeeded in mortally wounding the campaign of Mr. Biden over his alleged strong-arming of Ukraine\u2019s leaders in 2016 to oust a prosecutor who had been investigating an energy company that paid his son Hunter $3 million.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of helpful to have Biden disappear,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cI think it increases the chaos on their side. If I were a moderate Democrat right now, I\u2019d be really worried.\u201d\n\nHe expects Ms. Warren to emerge as the party\u2019s nominee next year and views it as a good outcome for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that as long as the economy does reasonably well, that Trump will win,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd [if] the Democrats do what I think they\u2019re going to do, which is nominate Warren, it could be like \u201872 \u2014 you could have a cataclysmic effect.\u201d\n\nThat was the year President Nixon defeated Democrat George McGovern in a landslide, capturing every state but Massachusetts.\n\nBut two years later, facing certain impeachment and removal from office over the Watergate affair, Nixon resigned.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
