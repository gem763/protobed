Martin.\n\n\u201cToday was a VERY IMPORTANT day for me,\u201d the actress gushed on Instagram. \u201cI read every single Babysitter\u2019s Club book when I was a kid. Once when I was 9, I waited in line for hours at my local bookstore to meet Ann M Martin. And today I got this in the mail from her.\u201d Based on Portman\u2019s pic, the BSC edition she received seems to be 1989\u2019s Kristy and the Walking Disaster, a seminal work of the series in which Kristy starts her softball team Kristy\u2019s Krushers and must coach them to victory against Bart\u2019s Bashers, despite her crush on the coach, Bart Taylor.\n\n\u201cI feel so lucky that I grew up with books about girls who worked together, supported each other, were entrepreneurs and who all had very different personalities.\u201d In her inscription, Anne M. Martin writes: \u201cFor Natalie Portman - BSC 4-ever!\u201d Concludes the actress, \u201cI still identify as a Kristy mixed with Stacey and a dash of Dawn.
