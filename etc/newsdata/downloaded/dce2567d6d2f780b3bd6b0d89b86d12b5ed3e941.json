I have known some of these people, like Katie Grand and Marc Jacobs, for years and still feel so honored to be the face of Marc\u2019s new launches,' she shared.\n\nThe teenage model was particularly happy about getting the opportunity to work with Nikkie, who built her brand on YouTube, where she now boasts more than 12 million subscribers.\n\nAll that's glam: The 17-year-old modeled the eyeliner with a double wing cat eye\n\nA star is born: Lila, who is the daughter of Kate Moss, first started working with Marc Jacobs Beauty in 2018 after she was announced as the new face for the brand\n\nSharing techniques: Lila, pictured with Kate at NYFW, revealed how she taught her supermodel mom how to apply highlighter while Kate taught her how to curl the eyelashes\n\n'When I found out Nikkie would be doing my makeup for the shoot, I was so excited. I\u2019ve followed her for so long and even got the chance to meet her in Paris a while ago. She\u2019s so talented and funny, so that made this photo shoot super fun and relaxing,' she said.\n\nAlthough the new campaign entails modeling eyeliner, Lila confessed to not yet feeling comfortable nailing the winged look on her own.\n\n'I still haven\u2019t fully mastered eyeliner application, but I\u2019m practicing with these new eyeliners,' she said, adding: 'They're much easier to use because the applicator is really good and it's smudge-proof.'\n\nThe double wing cat eye Nikkie created for Lila for the beauty campaign was something the fledgling model wanted to get down before the holidays, she admitted.\n\n'I love trying new beauty techniques and this was something bold I had never done before,' she said. 'I will definitely try to perfect it for the holidays especially.'\n\nLila's mom has been in the fashion industry for years and is even personal friends with Marc Jacobs, so one would think the teenager would get some of her beauty tips from Kate.\n\nBut, due to the ever-changing beauty industry, Lila has also taught her mom some tips when it comes to applying makeup.\n\n'I\u2019ve taught her how apply highlighter in the right places. Once, I noticed she did it completely wrong, so I had to correct it,' she said. 'She's shown me the best way to curl my eyelashes. She\u2019s always used an eyelash curler, and I used to be so scared to do it.'", "description": "Lila is the daughter of model Kate Moss and magazine editor Jefferson Hack.
