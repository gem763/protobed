This was apparently a big decision for the notoriously private Apple executive.\n\nAs he wrote in 2014: \u2018While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven\u2019t publicly acknowledged it either, until now. So let me be clear: I\u2019m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.\u2019\n\nNow, years later, speaking to People en Espanol, Cook has reiterated his thoughts.\n\nTim Cook is notoriously guarded about his private life (Reuters/Stephen Lam)\n\n\u2018I can only speak for myself, it gives me a level of empathy that I think is probably much higher than average because being gay or trans, you\u2019re a minority. And I think when you\u2019re a majority, even though intellectually you can understand what it means to be in a minority, it\u2019s an intellectual thing,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Gay is not a limitation. It\u2019s a characteristic that I hope they view, like I do, that it\u2019s God\u2019s greatest gift,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s what I hope: to get that message out there to all the young kids struggling with their identity who aren\u2019t certain that they\u2019re resilient enough or good enough, or [they] are made to feel inferior in some way, or worse, are ostracized or whatever.\u2019", "description": "'God's greatest gift'", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pri_52685969_1572008402.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
