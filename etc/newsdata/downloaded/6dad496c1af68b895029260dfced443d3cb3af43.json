The perception is that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock. This inference is drawn on the simple logic that a stock\u2019s current market price does not justify (is not equivalent to) its higher earnings and therefore has room to run.\n\nBut have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P/E can also be worth buying. We\u2019ll tell you why this often-overlooked approach may go a long way to cherry pick some solid stocks.\n\nWhy Rising P/E a Valuable Tool?\n\nInvestors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance. If earnings come in stronger, the price of a stock shoots up. Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts, leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price.\n\nSo, if the price is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of the stock\u2019s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it. Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30, it means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings. This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals.\n\nAlso, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.\n\nEPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year\u2019s actual growth\n\nPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero\n\n(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)\n\nPercentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks\n\nPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks\n\n(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes.)\n\nPercentage price change for four weeks relative to the greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500\n\nPercentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&P 500\n\n(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)\n\nPercentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%\n\n(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal.)\n\nIn addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) can get through.\n\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.\n\nJust these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 57.\n\nHere are five out of the 57 stocks:\n\nColumbia Sportswear Company ( (NASDAQ: ) ): The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is a global leader in design, sourcing, marketing and distribution of active outdoor apparel and footwear, with operations in North America, Europe and Asia.
