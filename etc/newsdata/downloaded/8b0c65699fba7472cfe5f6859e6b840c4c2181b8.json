It\u2019s important to me that we lead the DFB into a successful future, with efficient and transparent new structures. There won\u2019t be a one-man-show. The only way to further develop German football from the bottom to the top is together, as a team.\u201d\n\nKeller fills the position held on an interim basis by vice presidents Rainer Koch and Reinhard Rauball since April 2, when Reinhard Grindel resigned under pressure following allegations of undeclared earnings, the receipt of a luxury watch and general discontent with his leadership.\n\nRauball said Keller faced a \u201cHerculean task\u201d for the DFB to win back some of the trust lost in scandals under Grindel, and under his predecessors Wolfgang Niersbach and Theo Zwanziger.\n\n\u201cLost trust must be regained, even if the road will be a tedious one,\u201d Rauball said.\n\nNiersbach stepped down in November 2015 amid the fallout from allegations that Germany\u2019s bid to host the 2006 World Cup was helped by bribery, while Zwanziger stepped down in 2012.\n\nBoth Niersbach and Zwanziger face fraud charges brought about by Swiss prosecutors, and charges of tax evasion made by a prosecutor in Frankfurt.\n\nThe DFB is still burdened with the fallout from the affair. Treasurer Stephan Osnabr\u00fcgge reported tax refunds of 22.6 million euros ($24.7 million) in 2017 because the year 2006 lost its \u201cbenefit to the public\u201d status, while more than 7 million euros ($7.7 million) has been spent on legal fees.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After years of scandal, crisis and internal conflict, the German soccer federation is hoping former Freiburg president Fritz Keller can unite the body and usher in a new era of integrity.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
