They only way that should happen is if there was no extras\"\n\nWhile another penned: \"Agreed 100% - will turn Alex into (even more of) a comedy contestant - not sure what Gorka has done to be dropped & surely the non partnered dancers should have a chance before someone who\u2019s already been voted out? But then - Clifton. I rest my case.\"\n\n(Image: TV Grab)\n\n\"I said that!! Give the guy a chance this year. Making sense as always James!\" a third added.\n\nIt comes as former footballer Alex and her partner Neil have said there is no romance between them, and they are too \"immersed\" in the show to consider otherwise.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nNeil has also said that he is content being single after splitting from his wife and co-star Katya Jones, and that he is not interested in going on dating apps to find love.\n\nAlex and Neil\u2019s chemistry on the dancefloor sparked some speculation among fans, but Alex swiftly batted off the rumours, saying: \"It's great that everyone can see how well me and Neil get on, and that we do have this great partnership and it's not just for TV.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n\"But we're not thinking anything about that. We're together all the time training, and we're so immersed in Strictly and doing everything for the show, so that stuff hasn't even entered our thoughts.\"", "description": "The former Strictly pro slammed bosses on Twitter as Kevin stepped in for Neil with just 45 minutes to learn the routine", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Tv Grab", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734835.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2019-10-26-at-201138.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
