We - all of us working in the criminal justice system - need to come together now to discuss this.\"\n\nAndrea Simon, head of public affairs at End Violence Against Women, said the numbers showed women subjected to rape were being \"further victimised by a system that does not take them seriously\".\n\nShe added: \"These shocking and unjustifiable failings speak to a clear and concerted shift in how the CPS has decided to prosecute rape.\"\n\nFollowing the publishing of the report, it was announced that the independent CPS watchdog, Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, would review charging decisions in rape cases \"to increase accountability and reassure victims of sexual offences\".\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?
