The Great Gatsby character may have had a voice \u201cfull of money,\u201d but that voice does not have a six-pound, twelve-and-a-half-ounce trophy to prove it. Succession\u2019s theme \u2014 which sounds like tongue-kissing pyramids of cash \u2014 beat those of Castle Rock, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Good Omens, and Our Planet to win the Emmy for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music at Sunday night\u2019s Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Congratulations, Nicholas Britell, light of our lives and the internet\u2019s favorite composer. To celebrate, Britell and his bling gave us simple serfs a glimpse of him playing the theme on piano. \u201cI can\u2019t express enough how honored I am by this recognition @TelevisionAcad! Thank you to @jessearmstrong1, @GhostPanther, to our incredible cast and crew on Succession, to @HBO, and to all of the support from fans of the show!\u201d he wrote.

Some people \u2014 all right, us \u2014 want to dance to it, spend money we don\u2019t have on it, bathe in it! Maybe next year, Mrs. Buchanan.", "description": "Succession\u2019s theme \u2014 which sounds like tongue-kissing pyramids of cash \u2014 beat Castle Rock, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Good Omens, and Our Planet to win the Emmy for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards.", "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/18/18-nicholas-britell.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
