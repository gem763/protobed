Oil prices spiked by 2% on the news.\n\nIranian state television said the explosion damaged two storerooms aboard the unnamed oil tanker and caused an oil leak into the Red Sea near the Saudi port city of Jiddah.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency, quoting Iran\u2019s National Iranian Tanker Co., identified the stricken vessel as the Sabity. That vessel last turned on its tracking devices in August near the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas, according to data from MarineTraffic.com. Iranian tankers routinely turn off their trackers as U.S. sanctions target the sale of Iran\u2019s crude oil.\n\n\u201cThe oil tanker named SABITY belonging to the company sustained damages to the body when it was hit by missiles 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the Saudi port city of Jiddah,\u201d IRNA said.\n\nThe agency did not say whom Iranian officials suspect of launching the missiles.\n\nLt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet overseeing the Mideast, said authorities there were \u201caware of reports of this incident,\u201d but declined to comment further.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude oil rose over 2% in trading Friday to reach some $60.40 a barrel.\n\nThe reported attack comes after the U.S. has alleged that in past months Iran attacked oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, something denied by Tehran.\n\nFriday\u2019s incident could push tensions between Iran and the U.S. even higher, more than a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions now crushing Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nThe mysterious attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone and other incidents across the wider Middle East followed Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nThe latest assault saw Saudi Arabia\u2019s vital oil industry come under a drone-and-cruise-missile attack, halving the kingdom\u2019s output. The U.S. has blamed Iran for the attack, something denied by Tehran. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, whom the kingdom is fighting in a yearslong war, claimed that assault, though analysts say the missiles used in the attack wouldn\u2019t have the range to reach the sites from Yemen.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.", "description": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Two missiles struck an Iranian tanker traveling through the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia on Friday, Iranian officials said,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/889bf1_persian-gulf-tensions-03288-in-image-aboard-royal-navy-wildcat-helicopter-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
