Last night we saw Elly evicted for spending more time worrying about Abbie than Matt, which leaves us down to five girls for tonight\u2019s serving of beef.\n\nBut tonight was the long-awaited hometown dates, which in my humble opinion is when you really start to get to know the girls. Matt meets their family and finally gets to see them outside of the glammed-up mansion they pretend is their real life.\n\nThere were a few l-bombs from Abbie and Emma, and of course, Chelsie worried about whether she\u2019s going to get hurt. But HELENA. Phwoah! Helena was the real drama queen of this episode. Here\u2019s a tweet from jussssttttt before shit hit the fan. A simpler time.\n\nI love Helena. She's so down to earth a level headed. #TheBachelorAU #BachelorAu pic.twitter.com/Hn47xlH6vv \u2014 Hallwayhighway, Special Snowflake Squawking Bird (@hallwayhighway) September 12, 2019\n\nOn her home date, Matt forgot that one time she spoke French on the first date and she lost her fucking marbles. Obviously, Twitter thought it was hilarious because we had all forgotten too.\n\nHelena I don't remember what I asked my tutor at uni yesterday let alone what someone said to me 6 weeks ago please don't read into it #BachelorAu \u2014 Katie (@Clockwork_Katie) September 12, 2019\n\nHelena is a ball breaker. He met so many girls on the same night, and he's under pressure with your family. Relax. #BachelorAU \u2014 Jayde Mills (@jaydeskittle) September 12, 2019\n\nHe chose me over the 23 women he sent home\u2026. \u2026.but he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m special! #BachelorAu pic.twitter.com/AZwktbS6LQ \u2014 NRG (@NRG18335509) September 12, 2019\n\nThen she dumped his ass. Girl power? Or pathetic overreaction?\n\nomfg what the fuck is this meltdown even? Helena I\u2019m so confused #TheBachelorAU pic.twitter.com/7mKT9OvAS3 \u2014 Shauna O\u2019Carroll (@ShaunaOCarroll) September 12, 2019\n\nHelena looking for any excuse right now. Pretty sure her Mum just wants her to move out and would support the Honey Badger if it came down to it. #BachelorAU \u2014 cheyron (@cheyron4) September 12, 2019\n\nMatt comes grovelling back wanting her to love him so he can add her to the list of five girls he might want to date. She forgives him, then she dumps him again. Everyone was obviously confused.\n\nHelena when she finally came to her senses #TheBachelorAU pic.twitter.com/ywu2cObT7n \u2014 Isha Anand (@isha_anand20) September 12, 2019\n\nThen, when you thought she was out of the picture for good, she comes back right before the roses are given out to stir some more shit.\n\nHelena going for the trifecta of break ups #TheBachelorAU \u2014 Emily Daniels (@pineappleemily) September 12, 2019\n\nThe girls weren\u2019t happy, and Twitter lived for it.\n\nis chelsie the only one who isn't going to be a see you next tuesday about this? #TheBachelorAU \u2014 taryn \u0295\u0e07\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\u0e07 (@thereafter) September 12, 2019\n\nEmma is not playing, she did not give up her aging uterus for this #TheBachelorAU \u2014 Kiera (@UnderYourPorch) September 12, 2019\n\nShe forgives him again and ultimately gets a rose. Was this all a ploy to do the whole \u201ctreat \u2019em mean, keep \u2019em keen\u201d thing? I hope so. Helena seems like a force to be reckoned with, or is she just a drama plot?\n\nHelena brought the drama and in true form I predict he will keep her till next ep then send her home as he has done with every other dramatic person. #TheBachelorAU #BachelorAu \u2014 Hallwayhighway, Special Snowflake Squawking Bird (@hallwayhighway) September 12, 2019\n\nAlso, everyone fucking hates Matt\u2019s dumb suit.\n\nWho dresses this man? #TheBachelorAU \u2014 Andrei Wightman (@andrei73) September 12, 2019\n\nDon't accept a rose from anyone dressed in a suit like that\u2026#TheBachelorAU \u2014 Alison (@alijcoles) September 12, 2019\n\nSadly, Emma cops the boot. That\u2019s what you get for being an emotionally open person who isn\u2019t trying to fuck around and cause drama. Gosh Emma.\n\nAnd that\u2019s everything Twitter had to say about episode 14 of The Bachelor. I need to sit down, or drink. I\u2019m not quite sure yet. Feeling a little queasy after that roller coaster.\n\nSee ya next week, folks!", "description": "All of the best Twitter reactions from The Bachelor episode 14's home dates, meltdowns and unexpected breakups.
