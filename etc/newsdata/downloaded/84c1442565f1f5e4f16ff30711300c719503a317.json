'Please, please, Barclays,' says one. 'Think of your loyal customers.'\n\n'We have other problems to deal with in our 80s,' adds another.\n\nBarclays executives should feel ashamed \u2014 and must be heartless to ignore their customers' pleas.\n\nConsidering the outpouring from our readers, you have to wonder if those responsible for the bank's decision have ever travelled outside of London.\n\nIt seems they have forgotten that, while the capital is fast becoming a cashless bubble, access to physical money is still vital to everyday life in smaller towns and villages.\n\nMany businesses and traders in rural areas still take only cash, and the wifi signal isn't always strong enough for card machines.\n\nThis is a classic example of a major bank putting greed above customer needs.\n\nAnd the worst part is that the bank stands to save only around \u00a37 million a year \u2014 a drop in the ocean, given it made \u00a33.5 billion in profit last year.\n\nIt's also just twice the \u00a33.4 million pay cheque chief executive Jes Staley took home in 2018.\n\nBarclays, Mr Staley \u2014 it is not too late to right this wrong.\n\nWe may be more than a decade on from the financial crisis, but banks still have a long way to go to earn back our trust \u2014 and this is not the way to do it.\n\nIn the meantime, my message to those affected is to switch to a different bank that doesn't treat you with such disdain.\n\nWoodford woes\n\nThe decision to close Neil Woodford's fund yesterday was yet another blow for the financial sector's reputation.\n\nInvestors had trusted the fallen fund manager with their life savings.\n\nNow, they may get back only a fraction of the cash they had earmarked for house deposits, weddings and retirement.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority needs to launch a full investigation into what went wrong.\n\nIt must also examine its own culpability to prevent this calamity from happening again. If the regulator doesn't act quickly, any trust that is left will evaporate.\n\nPension payback\n\nThank you for all your letters and emails in support of our Unlock Our Pensions campaign.\n\nToday, we report how one Money Mail reader, Colin Jones, successfully fought his insurer for two years to reclaim his money.\n\nOne of Colin's annuities paid him just \u00a312 a month and the other \u00a348. He knew he didn't need this money for everyday expenses and would be far better off with a lump sum \u2014 but it took writing to his MP to convince ReAssure.\n\nIt's a brilliant reminder that perseverance can pay off \u2014 and proof that, despite their protests, insurers can hand back their customers' pension pots.\n\nTo help you unlock your pension, we've included a template letter on Page 47 that you can send to your insurer. Tell us how you get on.\n\nv.bischoff@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Is it any wonder that savers and investors have so little trust in the financial services sector?
