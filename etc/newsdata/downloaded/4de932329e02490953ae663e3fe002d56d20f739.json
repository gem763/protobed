Children shouldn\u2019t have to learn hungry,\u201d he added.\n\nLevy posted about his experience on Facebook soon after and started a chain reaction of people interested in doing the same thing all across Palm Beach County.\n\n\u201cI even have had some clients over the last 48 hours say, \u2018You know something? I want to help. I want to give, too,'\u201d Levy told WITI. \u201cEvery quarter, I\u2019m going to do either a GoFundMe page, or a fundraising page that can raise money every quarter so lunch debt never accumulates.\u201d\n\nLevy initially got the idea to pay off students lunch debts back in August after looking at a Facebook post from the Jupiter Mamas Facebook group in August pleading for help in paying off student lunch debt.\n\nWFTS reported that the post, from Angie Vyas-Knight, pleaded for help and listed the total lunch debt for more than 400 students in the Jupiter, Florida, area.", "description": "A Florida man paid off school lunch debt for over 400 children at nine different schools after learning that students were not being fed.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/School-Lunch-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
