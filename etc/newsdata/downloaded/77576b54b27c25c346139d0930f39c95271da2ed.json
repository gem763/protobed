You're messing with the wrong guy. I'll knock you into next week. I'll kill this ****.\"\n\nMs Masters said: \"He threatened 12 times that he would kill him.\"\n\nThe victim had to be protected by other passengers who intervened, bringing the victim's eight-minute ordeal to an end.\n\nHe was left shaken, upset and bleeding after Harding finally left the bus, the assault captured on CCTV.\n\nHe later said in a statement the encounter affected his mental health and made him upset, depressed and anxious about travelling by himself.\n\nAfter arrest, Harding said he could not remember anything of the incident and lost his temper under the influence of alcohol.\n\nHe said he would not have acted on his threats.\n\nHarding, of Billingham, admitted assault by beating and making threats to kill - his first conviction.\n\nHe came to court with references from his mother, former partner and friends speaking highly of him.\n\nDamian Sabino, defending, said the dad-of-three did not appreciate the other passenger's vulnerabilities at the time.\n\nWhen told about them by police, \"his face dropped, he felt great shame, he was sick to the stomach\", and made a frank confession.\n\nMr Sabino said Harding drank more than usual at a friend's birthday celebration and became paranoid that night.\n\nHe added: \"There's been a backlash. He's received online threats, abuse in the locale where he lives.\n\n\"The impact is that in fact he doesn't go out and he's become abstinent from alcohol. There's been an impact on his family.\"\n\nHarding had a relative with autistic traits and this was a \"constant reminder of what happened\".\n\nHe wrote a \"quite moving\" letter to the victim, said Mr Sabino: \"He extends through me his genuine remorse and deep shame.\"\n\nJudge Peter Armstrong told Harding: \"If this had been a single punch, a single threat, it might have been possible to avoid an immediate custodial sentence.\n\n\"But this was a persistent and sustained incident where you punched him more than once and threatened to kill him on numerous occasions.\n\n\"Obviously you did not intend to kill him but the intent was to cause him to believe that. He was understandably extremely upset.\n\n\"It was in public on the bus when someone was just going about their lawful business going home.\n\n\"They are entitled to the protection of the courts from people who behave in this appalling way.\n\n\"This was a drunken ranting episode.\n\n\"Your remorse is genuine. I've read the letter which you've written to the victim. It'll be a matter for him whether he reads it or not.\n\n\"It has to be immediate custody. The nature of this attack on a vulnerable person I'm afraid means that only immediate custody can be justified for the offences, but I keep the sentence as low as I can.\"\n\nHarding was jailed for six months, his first time in prison.", "description": "Billingham labourer Mark Harding, 31, threatened to kill his fellow bus passenger 12 times during the violent assault where victim screamed in terror", "authors": ["Gareth Lightfoot", "Image", "Ian Cooper", "Teesside Live", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20499511.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_COURT-SNATCH-NO-PICTURE-CREDITMark-Robert-Harding-31-of-Mendip-Road-Billingham-appeared-at-Tees.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
