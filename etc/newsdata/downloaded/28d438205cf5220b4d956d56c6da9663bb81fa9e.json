Namely: Is this a fetish thing? Perhaps I was being a little too adult and cynical at the time. In this very sweet comic by Vaugh Pinpin, this pile of goo is Luigi\u2019s closest confidant.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Luigi isn\u2019t still having a hard time. In one strip,, his pal melts into a pile of goo before he can work out the issues he\u2019s having with Mario.\n\nThese strips, which began on July 5 and just finished up over the weekend, are a charming and empathetic look into the green-outfitted plumber. The year of Luigi is long over, and Mario\u2019s reign has returned. Feeling overshadowed by a family member or friend is a feeling that lots of people experience in real life. Who\u2019s to say that Luigi doesn\u2019t get lonely, too?\n\nPinpin said on Twitter that he originally planned on compiling the comics into a zine but had gotten so many donations that it felt unfair not to share the happy ending with the world.\n\n\u201cIt felt weird not to just put the ending up here as a thank you for people\u2019s generosity,\u201d Pinpin wrote. I appreciate this generosity, made in the spirit of Luigi, at the start of the work week\u2019s grind. Remember, if you don\u2019t have a friend to talk to right now, you can always make your own.", "description": "When I first saw Gooigi, a puzzle-solving Luigi clone made of goo who first appeared in the 3DS remaster of Luigi\u2019s Mansion and will also be in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, I had a few questions about him.
