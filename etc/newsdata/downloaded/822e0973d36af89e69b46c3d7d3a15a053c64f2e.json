'We know the talent there. It's great his contract is signed now, weeks ago.\n\n'I thought the problems he gave Newcastle consistently were things that I really want to see from him which are end product, delivery into the box, getting at people, running behind people, all those things are what we all know Callum has as a young talent.'\n\nLampard has favoured a 4-3-3 system since he took over from Maurizio Sarri with Tammy Abraham the first-choice No 9 and Willian a regular down the right. That has left real competition down the left since the summer departure of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid.\n\nHudson-Odoi has impressed since returning to fitness and got the vital assist on Saturday\n\nWhile it was 'impossible' for Chelsea to get a like-for-like replacement, Lampard insists he is trying to change the mentality to take the onus off one individual player.\n\n'Whether I became manager or not, Eden Hazard was not going to be replaced by anyone anywhere near similar to what he did for this club,' the Chelsea boss added.\n\n'I don't think it was possible, unless you went to the absolute top with the Messis and Ronaldos, because I think Eden pushes him around that bracket.\n\n'The next question is how do we change that? Of course we've seen a bit of youth come through with different ideas. I work consistently on the team as a group that we can create chances from different areas of the pitch. It's great that a left-back scored inside the box at the weekend, for instance.\n\n'So it will be hard to replace him. It's impossible. But as a team we can find a way and hopefully we're working towards that.'\n\nAjax are top of the group standings after two matches and with a double-header against Chelsea, they know victory on Wednesday night can see them take a big stride towards securing a place in the knockout stages.", "description": "Frank Lampard admits that Callum Hudson-Odoi (bottom right) and Christian Pulisic (top right) are adding to his selection headache ahead of Chelsea's Champions League visit of Ajax.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/18/20048046-0-image-a-19_1571766056627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
