This is not about split screens, or the ability to see CarPlay on the dashboard screen and your phone at the same time. This is about multiple in-car screens displaying CarPlay simultaneously. There aren\u2019t any cars that can do that yet. I apologize if this story was confusing. But read on!\n\nCar owners looking to test out some of Apple CarPlay\u2019s newest and coolest features that are rolling out with iOS 13 may have a little while longer to wait than they\u2019d prefer.\n\nOne of the biggest changes coming to CarPlay is the ability to project your iPhone\u2019s display on two different screens in the vehicle at the same time. Think Spotify running on your main infotainment screen while Apple Maps is displayed on the digital instrument cluster behind your steering wheel or a head-up display. \u201cAutomakers can develop CarPlay systems that show information in a second screen, such as in a cluster or HUD,\u201d Apple says. Sounds cool, right? Well, unfortunately, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any cars on the road today that support this function \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nThe Verge reached out to 10 major automakers about the updated version of CarPlay\n\nThe Verge reached out to 11 major automakers about the updated version of CarPlay. Most of them said their vehicles will be compatible with the updated version of CarPlay, including the ability to support various-sized screens. But none of them said they would be able to support the multiscreen feature at this time.\n\nHere\u2019s what they told us:\n\nHonda: \u201cFor the Honda lineup, our cars all use single infotainment screen displays. And, iOS 13\u2019s new CarPlay works across all of the vehicles, regardless of the size of the display in our cars. : )\u201d\n\nToyota: \u201cYes, it will work on multiple sized screens. Additionally, we do support the new multifunction dashboard within CarPlay which can display multiple applications (map, audio, etc.) on the same screen at the same time. Currently, we do not have any vehicles with multiple screens.\u201d\n\nGM: \u201cAll GM vehicles that are CarPlay capable will support the iOS13 update.\u201d Will it work on multiple screens though? \u201cWe don\u2019t have any more details to share beyond what I already sent. Stay tuned...\u201d\n\nFiat-Chrysler: \u201cAny FCA vehicle with CarPlay support can run it, so all of our vehicles 2017 or newer are included.\u201d Will it work on multiple screens? \u201cMore info on that at a later date.\u201d\n\nHyundai: \u201cWith iOS 13 we have support for our various screen sizes, including the All-New Palisade which features a large 10.25 display (it looks great!). I just tested it out. We don\u2019t support the displaying on both displays (instrument cluster in this example) at this time \u2013 only the Main AVN screen.\u201d\n\nFord: \u201cAll CarPlay capable SYNC 3 [Ford\u2019s brand name for its infotainment system] vehicles in the field and newly produced will be compatible with the new Apple iOS 13 interface.\u201d What about multiple screens? \u201cI am not aware of such an availability currently, and cannot comment on future product plans.\u201d\n\nVolkswagen: \u201cBasically, iOS 13 updates to CarPlay will be shown on the OCU, even on an older gen vehicle that has App Connect.\u201d No response to our multiple screens follow-up.\n\nBMW: \u201cBMW vehicles with Apple CarPlay compatibility will support the new version of Apple CarPlay in iOS13 when it is released. No vehicle update will be required.\u201d No response to our multiple screens follow-up.\n\nWe\u2019re still waiting to hear back from Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, and Volvo.\n\nWe\u2019re already hearing some people grumbling about their car being unable to keep pace with their phone\u2019s software upgrades, and it\u2019s an understandable gripe. Car companies have tried to keep Apple and Google at arm\u2019s length for years, believing they could build in-car technology that rivaled the mobile industry for its usability and functionality. Now, we\u2019re seeing carmakers basically throw in the towel and admit that their customers prefer their phone\u2019s interface to their car\u2019s.\n\nAnother issue that has the auto industry dragging its heels is over-the-air (OTA) software updates. Legacy automakers have struggled to catch up to Tesla, which has long been the leader in shipping OTA updates to its customers to change everything from its advanced driver assistance system to the layout and look of its touchscreen displays. GM is the first major automaker to implement an OTA system after Tesla. Ford has also said it would start rolling out software updates for its 2020 models.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t help Tesla owners who are hoping to use CarPlay, however, as the company doesn\u2019t support it at all.", "description": "The Verge reached out to 10 major automakers about the updated version of CarPlay.
