Giuliani, on Thursday as part of their impeachment investigation.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two key players in Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine investigate the Biden family, are being required to turn over documents to the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees by Oct. 16. They must also testify before the committees, although that date was not specified.\n\nThe chairs of those three committees \u2014 Reps. Adam B. Schiff, Elijah E. Cummings and Eliot L. Engel \u2014 warned that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman cannot claim executive privilege to avoid cooperating with the investigation.\n\n\u201cYour clients are private citizens who are not employees of the Executive Branch. They may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani, and they may not defy congressional subpoenas merely because President Trump has chosen the path of denial, defiance, and obstruction.\u201d\n\nMr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were initially required to turn over documents by Oct. 7 and testify by Oct. 11.\n\nEarlier this week, the White House sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi informing her that the administration would not cooperate with any requests or demands from Democrats as part of the impeachment investigation until the House authorized it with a full vote.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, both Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman \u2014 who were born in Ukraine but now live in Florida \u2014 were indicted on campaign finance charges, although apparently unrelated to the Ukraine incident.\n\nThe two men connected Mr. Giuliani to a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to push the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings abroad.\n\nThe allegations that Mr. Trump, along with Mr. Giuliani, used the office of the presidency and military aid as leverage to pressure the foreign ally is at the center of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have maintained that their interactions with the Ukrainians were not illegal.\n\nThe investigation into Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman originated from a complaint filed by the Campaign Legal Center in July 2018.\n\n\u201cThe public is now learning just how dangerous dark money can be in U.S. elections, including the potential for illegal foreign funds, which DOJ says were used here,\u201d CLC President Trevor Potter, a former Republican FEC chairman, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe fact that these two individuals were working with Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials to alter U.S. policy in that country will obviously be relevant to the impeachment investigation,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2022 Jeff Mordock contributed to this article.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
