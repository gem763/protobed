Some experts, including Beightol, say wood combs can be better for more voluptuous beards. \u2018For thicker beards, larger-size wooden combs are popular with our guys,\u2019 he says. \u2018These combs tend to have wider-spaced teeth to help detangle curly and thick hair.\u2019 And Priore likes wood \u2018because it\u2019s usually sanded very smoothly; it keeps the snagability down.\u2019 He admits that a piece of wood might not be the most practical thing to slip in your pocket, but \u2018if you want a nice comb you can keep at the house, go for a wooden comb.\u2019 And when we asked other experts about tools for trimming beards, they recommended using wooden combs over plastic, which one expert said \u2018can cause static in facial hair.\u2019\n\nWooden beard combs are typically available in two options: a double-sided comb with fine teeth on one side and wide teeth on the other, or a simple single-sided comb. According to the experts, it really comes down to personal preference, but three said that double-sided is the way to go. As Beightol explains: \u2018A two-sided comb is good for using if your beard has different patches of thickness, which is common with long, thick beards. So the wider teeth help with thick patches and the narrower teeth help with thinner or finer hair.\u2019 Ruscetta suggests this one from the Art of Shaving. \u2018All beard combs look pretty similar,\u2019 says Ruscetta, but he likes that this one is on the thicker side and should be strong enough to carry around if you want to. It\u2019s made from sandalwood, so it will have a light natural scent, and it comes with a pouch to store it in. [Editor\u2019s note: The Art of Shaving doesn\u2019t ship outside the US, so we\u2019ve chosen a similar item with great reviews.]", "description": "The best beard combs include a set of acetate beard and mustache combs from Kent, a double-sided sandalwood beard comb from The Art of Shaving, and wood beard comes from Parker and Breezelike and Beardoholic.
