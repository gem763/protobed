Weird and not especially appetising: a bit like when someone mistakenly pours some red into your glass while there\u2019s still some white left in it. The practice actually used to be quite widespread in European vineyards, where white and red grapes where often planted, harvested and fermented together. And a red-white blend is still the base of one of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley\u2019s greatest wine styles: winemakers in the tiny appellation of C\u00f4te R\u00f4tie just south of Lyon mix a dash of the apricot and honeysuckle-scented white grape variety viognier to the spicy red grape syrah. It\u2019s a recipe that has inspired the team at Provence\u2019s Ch\u00e2teau Campuget, whose version is an unusually fragrant, supple, compulsively drinkable red.\n\nZalze Shiraz Mourv\u00e8dre Viognier, Western Cape, South Africa 2017 (from \u00a36, Morrisons; Asda; Waitrose) My favourite examples of the classic 95% syrah, 5% viognier blend are still those made on the vertiginously steep, \u201croasted\u201d slopes of C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie, among them the classically silky, red-fruited and subtly savoury Patrick Jasmin C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie 2016 (\u00a349.95, Yapp Brothers) \u2013 a wine that will be sure to add more savoury depths and interest for many years to come. But winemakers all over the world have been inspired by the C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie way, not least in South Africa, where the Rh\u00f4ne in general has been a touchstone for some of the best of the country\u2019s 21st-century wines. There is but 1% viognier alongside the syrah and other red grapes in Boekenhoutskloof The Chocolate Block, Swartland 2017 (from \u00a322, Majestic; Waitrose), but it helps give aromatic life to this deep, meaty-savoury classic; and he white grape also adds fruity vibrancy to Zalze\u2019s chunky, spicy bargain.\n\nVandal Gonzo Combat Rouge, Marlborough, New Zealand 2018 (\u00a319.99, Dorset Wine) Another place where the blend of viognier and syrah (or shiraz as it\u2019s generally known there) works well is Australia. That\u2019s no surprise given the Australians did so much to raise awareness of the viognier grape as the base of opulent white wines inspired by C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie\u2019s neighbouring white wine appellation, Condrieu. The producer behind many of the best Aussie viognier whites matches it with shiraz for the suavely stylish, polished and perfumed Yalumba Hand-Picked Shiraz-Viognier, Eden Valley 2015 (\u00a329.95, Hennings Wine), while Yering Station Little Yering Shiraz-Viognier 2016 (\u00a310.99, VinVm), from the cooler climate of Victoria\u2019s Yarra Valley, has a juicy, pepper-spiced exuberance. On the other side of the Tasman Sea, meanwhile, the experimental trio of winemakers working together at Vandal have made a brilliant natural red that sits somewhere between the Rh\u00f4ne and Burgundy in style, mixing pinot noir, syrah and viognier for something joyously fluent and red-fruited.\n\nFollow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
