The Hong Kong and China national teams are separate, but FIFA plays the Chinese anthem because Hong Kong is considered an administrative region of China.\n\nDisciplinary records said that Hong Kong supporters breached article 16 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code by disturbing a national anthem and using objects to \"transmit a message that is not appropriate for a sports events.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Football Association has been ordered to pay 15,000 Swiss francs ($15,000 U.S.) and was given a warning. Hong Kong football officials can appeal the decision.\n\nA video taken during the September game shows supporters facing backward and booing as China's national anthem plays.\n\nDuring halftime, Hong Kong fans surrounded the stadium, locked arms and sang \"Glory to Hong Kong,\" a song widely adopted as the protest anthem.\n\nThough Hong Kong lost to Iran 2-0, protesters were happy to use the game to increase awareness to their cause.\n\n\"The emotion here is good, though we lost,\" Hong Kong supporter Leo Fan told the AP. \"We will fight till the end.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Football Association have yet to comment on their sanction.\n\nDuring the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, Hong Kong was disciplined three times.

Hong Kong was fined twice, totalling about $15,000.\n\nFIFA isn't the only sporting federation to involve itself in the Hong Kong liberation movement. Earlier this week, the Houston Rockets' general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong protesters. The Chinese Basketball Association then announced it will suspend cooperation with the Rockets.\n\nThe league's commissioner clarified Tuesday that the NBA supports free speech, after the Rockets' owner and an NBA spokesman denounced Morey's statement.\n\nPaolo Zialcita is an intern on NPR's News Desk.", "description": "Fans at the Hong Kong vs. Iran World Cup qualifier game in September faced backward and booed as the Chinese national anthem played before kickoff.", "authors": ["Paolo Zialcita"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/09/ap_19253560913921_wide-bab4c39d02e4bc65f4dc1bdc8adea1820f03090c.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
