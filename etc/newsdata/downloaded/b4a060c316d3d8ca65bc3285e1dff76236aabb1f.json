However, not all of them are surrounded by an accretion disc (Image: Nasa)\n\n\u2018On the upside, we know that the Earth would not get \u201csucked in\u201d,\u2019 they wrote in a paper published in early form on the website Arxiv.\n\n\u2018On the downside, the Sun provides almost all the energy necessary for life on Earth to survive.\n\n\u2018Without its constant heat flux, the oceans would likely freeze over in a matter of days.\u2019\n\nFor a planet to be habitable, its temperature is crucial.\n\nIf it\u2019s too far from a star \u2013 or if it\u2019s orbiting an object which doesn\u2019t produce enough heat \u2013 then water will freeze, making it difficult or impossible for life as we know it to survive.\n\nWhen a planet\u2019s too near a star and therefore is blasted with enough heat to boil water, it will also be inhospitable.\n\nHowever, black holes are sometimes surrounded by a hot \u2018accretion disk\u2019 which produces heat.\n\nThe Nasa scientists added: \u2018We also know that many astrophysical black holes can provide their own energy source.\n\n\u2018In fact, for most observable black holes, this\u2026 power outweighs anything attainable from nuclear fusion by many orders of magnitude.\n\n\u2018So one could naturally imagine that replacing the Sun with a\u2026 black hole might not be the end of life on earth after all.\u2019\n\nSadly, the rest of the Nasa study is not good news for anyone who fancies living near a dark sun.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s likely that a planet would be \u2018tidally locked\u2019 \u2013 which means it would always be facing the hole rather than spinning like Earth.\n\nUnless there was some mechanism which distributed heat around the planet, its dark side would be frozen.\n\nIf an alien world was close to the accretion disc, it would be bombarded with radiation unless its inhabitants were advanced enough to build some sort of gigantic shield.\n\nIn order for it to be habitable yet still heated by the monster\u2019s accretion disc, it would have to be \u2018extremely far from the black hole\u2019.\n\nEven then, denizens would face \u2018nature\u2019s silent killer: neutrinos\u2019, which are tiny subatomic particles.\n\nAnd as if that all wasn\u2019t bad enough, we know that time dilates near black holes \u2013 which means it effectively slows down so that one year to people living near the beast might the equivalent of many, many years to people dwelling elsewhere.\n\nSo if you settle near a black hole, you might take a holiday back home and find everyone you ever knew was dead because time had slowed down for you but stayed the same for people on your home world.\n\nAll of which means it\u2019s probably not very likely than an alien civilisation is surviving near a supermassive black hole.", "description": "If you think living on Earth is bad, wait until you hear about the conditions on worlds orbiting 'supermassive' monsters.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRI_86888014_1570203819.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
