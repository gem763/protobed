This sell-out deal risks our rights, protections and NHS. It won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. pic.twitter.com/ZMKSNt2Nc9 \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) October 17, 2019\n\nThe Labour leader confirmed he will support a referendum on the deal before it comes into effect, which could further delay the process which has dragged on for three years, much to the frustration of \u2018Leave\u2019 voters and EU negotiators.\n\nCorbyn warned the deal would trigger a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d while suggesting that it betrayed not only the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up Johnson\u2019s government, but also voters who were given assurances that their jobs would be protected post-Brexit.\n\n\u201cFrom what we\u2019ve read of this deal, it doesn\u2019t meet our demands or expectations, it creates a border down the Irish Sea and it leads once again to a race to the bottom in rights and protections for British citizens and a danger of the sell-off of our national assets to American companies,\u201d Corybn said.\n\nAlso on rt.com Brexit deal has been struck - Johnson and Juncker announce 'fair and balanced' agreement\n\nHowever, when the text of the deal was published after Corbyn\u2019s remarks, it specifically stated a commitment to \u201cmaintaining \u2018environmental, social and employment standards at the current high levels,\u201d though this may be seen as platitude rather than policy for the moment.\n\nThe Labour leader also gave assurances that, were a general election held and won, his party would negotiate its own Brexit deal with the EU within three months, after which point it would put the deal to a public vote within a further three months.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s apparent knee-jerk reaction irked many in the conservative establishment.\n\nTory deputy chairman Paul Scully railed against Corbyn jumping the gun without having read the actual text of the deal.\n\n\u201cIt beggars belief Corbyn rejected the deal before he\u2019d even read it,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cIt shows he has no intention of keeping his promises to respect the referendum, and would only inflict yet more dither and pointless delay on the country.\u201d\n\nConservative MP Michael Fabricant called Corbyn \u201cthe most unpopular Opposition leader since records began\u201d adding that \u201chis immediate condemnation of the deal\u201d brought this point into sharper relief.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s ex-communications boss Sir Robbie Gibb claimed that Corbyn was trying to \u201cwelch on a bet\u201d while decrying \u201cthe shameless speed with which Corbyn can denounce a deal.\u201d\n\nSome online commentators merely saw it as \u201cpolitics as usual\u201d and didn\u2019t really see what the fuss was about.\n\nI\u2019m going to take a guess that @BorisJohnson dismissed @theresa_may deal before he had even read it. \u2014 Bette Lynch (@BetteMLynch) October 17, 2019\n\nthis has such Jeremy Corbyn energy pic.twitter.com/1c9n6wcFmA \u2014 Tom Harwood (@tomhfh) October 17, 2019\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
