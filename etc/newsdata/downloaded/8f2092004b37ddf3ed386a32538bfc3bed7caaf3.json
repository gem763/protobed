It appears the EU is willing to grant an extension but will state that further negotiations will not take place.\n\nUK\u2019s PM Boris Johnson will still push for an election which might keep a bit of pressure on both the pound and euro.\n\nFed Meets later this week\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet later in the week and is highly expected to cut the interest rate yet again. The markets have fully priced in a cut this week and are pricing in a roughly 1 in 5 chance of another cut by the end of the year.\n\nThe latest US jobs report will come out on Friday. There is some potential to see EUR/USD fall into a range considering that these market-moving events are scheduled in the second half of the week.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nEUR/USD found some buyers at 1.1072 which is a level that acted as support in July and August and resistance in September.\n\n[fx-image src=/2019/10/EURUSD-Daily-Chart-12.png originalWidth=916 ratio=2.13 data-zoom-target=https://responsive.fxempire.com/cdn/n/n/_fxempire_/2019/10/EURUSD-Daily-Chart-12.png]\n\nA rising trendline from the October low broke down during the decline last week and is currently being retested. Beyond this, the current recovery might see a further hurdle at the 1.1100 handle followed by 1.1129.\n\n[fx-image src=/2019/10/EURUSD-4-Hour-Chart-13.png originalWidth=916 ratio=2.13 data-zoom-target=https://responsive.fxempire.com/cdn/n/n/_fxempire_/2019/10/EURUSD-4-Hour-Chart-13.png]\n\nAt this stage, there isn\u2019t enough evidence that the pair has reverted back to the bullish trend that has taken place for the majority of the month. It might take a push back above for that to happen 1.1129.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEUR/USD is catching a bounce from support at 1.1072. This level stands to keep the pair higher in the session ahead.\n\nThe economic calendar is light today and volatility is likely to rise in the second half of the week.\n\nOngoing Brexit developments stand to impact the pair, particularly if the UK decides to have an election.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "After declining in the past two sessions, EUR/USD is firming from a well-respected horizontal support level.", "authors": ["Jignesh Davda"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cPRktpwXBeStjmPpq1zKig--~B/aD00MTA7dz02MTU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/0eaa6c079c5ab17ed1e872444a3c75cf", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
