When he appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d right after the 2016 election and punctured the funereal mood of the proceedings by urging the mourning viewers\u2014and cast members\u2014to give Donald Trump \u201ca chance,\u201d it was as if he were in a contest with Kanye West to audition for the part of most malevolent traitor to the black community.\n\nHis latest Netflix one-time stand-up show, \u201cSticks and Stones,\u201d recorded earlier this year before an audience in Atlanta, has been greeted with the usual outcry. But given his reputation as a renegade scourge of political correctness, I was a little surprised and even offended as I watched the show this week.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the endless repetition of the F-word or the N-word, which has become a kind of mandatory verbal tic for black performers. Nor was it the defense of Michael Jackson against his accusers, which seemed odd and even a little contrived\u2014as though a producer had urged him to come up with something really outrageous for the pre-broadcast publicity. I was also unmoved by his denunciations of \u201ccancel culture\u201d\u2014whereby the career of a phenomenally successful entertainer is derailed by the revelation of some improper remarks or behavior from years earlier, which looks a little self-serving. I\u2019m sure there have been some injustices, but I have little space in my limited capacity for human sympathy to weep for the likes of Louis C.K.\n\n\u201c His routine takes swipes at everyone\u2014the hypocrisies, inconsistencies, absurdities and extremism in our culture. \u201d\n\nWhat surprised me was that much of his material consisted of cutting, vicious\u2014and yes, funny\u2014jokes about how terrible white people are. He makes fun of the opioid epidemic devastating so many rural and small-town white communities, echoing the familiar refrain on the left that white people are getting a taste of the crack epidemic among mostly blacks in the 1980s. \u201cJust say no,\u201d he offers. \u201cNow how easy is that?\u201d\n\nHe also makes jokes about the threat posed by young white male school shooters. Perhaps the funniest line of the whole show comes when he urges black men to go out and buy guns. \u201cEvery able-bodied African-American man must register for a legal firearm. That\u2019s the only way they will change the law.\u201d It\u2019s a near-perfect comic line\u2014funny and yet carrying the faintest hint of credibility.\n\nBut these jokes and others in a similar vein fall neatly within the canon of approved liberal orthodoxy, so they\u2019re not controversial. Instead, Mr. Chappelle is defined by the material that gets the politically correct crowd riled up\u2014and there\u2019s plenty of that in the show. He makes jokes about LGBTQ\u2014the people who\u2019ve taken over \u201c20% of the letters of the alphabet.\u201d He makes fun especially of transgender people, including a slightly crass comparison of the identity confusion some transgender people feel with the suggestion that he thinks he may really be a Chinese man.\n\nHe makes a piercing moral-equivalence joke about abortion, saying he\u2019s fine with a woman\u2019s choice to get rid of a pregnancy, but in exchange men should be allowed to walk away from responsibility for a child if the woman goes ahead with the pregnancy to completion.\n\nIn short, Mr. Chappelle is not some crusading right-wing, countercultural figure, tearing down the liberal establishment. He\u2019s an equal-opportunity offender. His routine takes swipes at everyone\u2014the hypocrisies, inconsistencies, absurdities and extremism in our culture.\n\nHe is, in that sense, a true comic\u2014one of extraordinary talent and sophistication. Maybe I\u2019m offended by jokes about opioid abuse killing white people. But I can laugh at them and acknowledge that, yes, he has a right to make them. Comedy is vital to the ability of a society to examine and challenge itself.\n\nThe Chappelle flap is further evidence of how boringly predictable so much of our modern popular culture has become. He shocks because he is the rare voice willing to question the vice-like grip of the liberal establishment on the vocabulary and syntax of popular discussion. But popular culture was once defined by its willingness to challenge. Artists, musicians, comedians and writers enriched us by delivering shocking affronts to the sensibilities of the people who laid down the rules of our society.\n\nToday\u2019s performers mostly fall over each other to demonstrate new establishment bona fides. They may call themselves woke. They\u2019re barely breathing.", "description": "He uses his stand-up routine to mock the pieties that define our popular culture.", "authors": ["Gerard Baker", "Gerard.Baker Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EX135_BAKER_SOC_20190905160722.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
