Although the money has yet to be allocated, Babylon \u2013 which welcomed the announcement \u2013 is well placed to benefit as a key player in the AI field.\n\nProfile Who is Dominic Cummings? Show Hide Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history. After three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro. Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002. While he was seen as a \u201cyoung, thrusting moderniser\u201d, Cummings quickly offended party traditionalists. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent. Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education complained to the Independent of an \u201cus-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture\u201d created by Cummings and Gove. He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching media interviews and published rambling blogposts that are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as \u201ca sphinx without a riddle\u201d, and former Brexit minister David Davis as \u201cthick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus\u201d. In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum leave campaign in April of the following year. Since the EU referendum, its tactics have been the subject of a series of high-profile scandals. Vote Leave\u2019s use of data analytics has been scrutinised after the Observer reported that the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica had links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ, on which Vote Leave spent 40% of its campaign budget.\n\nIn July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was fined \u00a361,000 and referred to the police.\n\nCummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news. Frances Perraudin\n\nBabylon already holds a contract with Hammersmith and Fulham clinical commissioning group (CCG), in west London, to provide NHS GP appointments via phone and video link to patients through its GP at Hand app. Although more than 50,000 have signed up for the service, the app is said to have increased the cash-strapped CCG\u2019s costs, creating a \u00a321.6m funding hole [paywall].\n\nEarlier this year it was confirmed that the GP app was set to be introduced in Birmingham and this month Babylon announced plans to take it to Manchester in 2020.\n\nBabylon recently raised $550m (\u00a3449m) in a new funding round led by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, valuing it at $2bn. It is recruiting heavily, with more than 40 adverts for AI-related roles listed on its website.\n\nThere are no political rules requiring special advisers to disclose previous private sector roles.\n\nHowever, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Cummings\u2019 undisclosed advisory role raised serious questions about potential conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cThe links between Dominic Cummings in the heart of Downing Street, the health secretary and this AI health firm are increasingly murky and highly irresponsible,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cMr Cummings\u2019 work for this company raises serious questions about a potential conflict of interest, given the firm could be in line to receive public money from this new \u00a3250m AI fund.\n\n\u201cWe need to know if he declared his work for the firm to the cabinet secretary when he joined the government payroll. If not, why not?\u201d\n\nAndy Slaughter, the Labour MP for Hammersmith and Fulham where Babylon\u2019s GP app launched, said: \u201cBabylon is an organisation which is, via its GP at Hand app, distorting and undermining the whole basis on which primary care has worked since the founding of the NHS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just privatisation, it is undermining the ability of local GPs to serve their patients in a sustainable way \u2026 To learn that the prime minister\u2019s top adviser has been paid to help the firm is deeply concerning.\n\n\u201cCummings\u2019 work for Babylon raises a clear conflict of interest [concern].\u201d\n\nHancock repeatedly boosted Babylon and promised to help change rules to benefit the company. In September 2018, soon after his appointment as health secretary, he visited Babylon and told staff how much he admired their work and wanted the NHS to help the company grow.\n\nIn an accompanying Telegraph interview, Hancock praised the company and said he used its GP app. \u201cGP at Hand is revolutionary,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI want to see GP at Hand available to all, not based on their postcode.\u201d\n\nHancock was criticised for a further endorsement of Babylon\u2019s app in a feature sponsored by the company in the Evening Standard two months later.\n\nThe app is controversial with some NHS clinicians, who are concerned it could leave conventional GP services underfunded and with only the most difficult patients. They also have concerns about the reliability of its AI for diagnosis.\n\nThe decision to allocate \u00a3250m a year to AI projects in health \u2013 via NHSX, a \u201chealthtech\u201d public body launched by Hancock earlier this year \u2013 could benefit Babylon, experts suggest.\n\nSam Smith, the head of policy at the patient confidentiality campaign group MedConfidential, said there was good reason to believe a large chunk of the \u00a3250m would go to private companies such as Babylon given the government has previously required NHS data and innovation projects to have commercial partners on board.\n\n\u201cThe current government has a policy that all analytics must involve private companies, so whether [private companies] get the whole \u00a3250m or just most of it is a political decision,\u201d he said. \u201cA public option for AIs used by the NHS is necessary to ensure a competitive market.\u201d\n\nBabylon confirmed Cummings was paid via his company, Dynamic Maps Ltd, which he set up in October 2017 as the sole director. The firm \u2013 said to provide \u201cinformation technology consultancy activities\u201d \u2013 has net assets worth \u00a378,751, according to Companies House records.\n\nDowning Street declined to answer detailed questions about Cummings\u2019 consultancy work, including his earnings from Babylon, which other firms he had advised, and why it had not been publicly disclosed. A spokesman said: \u201cSpecial advisers act in accordance with special advisers\u2019 code and the relevant provisions of the civil service code, acting with integrity, and serving the public interest. Special advisers have no role in authorising expenditure of public funds.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health did not respond when asked whether Hancock was aware of Cummings\u2019 role at Babylon.\n\nIn a statement, Babylon stressed Cummings\u2019 role had been a \u201cvery short piece of one-off consultancy to draft a communications strategy\u201d, with 10 days worked in total. \u201cBabylon helps the NHS by reducing A&E visits by 3.8% (4,560 fewer visits per year at our current size) \u2013 and at no extra cost to the NHS. Our symptom checker tool has been used over 1.5m times and no patient has ever reported a serious problem.\u201d\n\nIt said of the government\u2019s \u00a3250m fund: \u201cGovernments around the world are investing in AI and it\u2019s brilliant that the UK government is following suit.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s aide was consultant for AI startup that could win share of \u00a3250m fund", "authors": ["James Ball", "Simon Murphy", "Ben Stockton", "Duncan Weldon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06134a34a0ac9451e39b1ea50fb79779f941233c/66_274_3434_2061/master/3434.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74c505870deec1a9f034a3fe0a3cb437", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
