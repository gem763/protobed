Sydney and Singapore each added 0.1 percent, with Manila and Jakarta also higher.\n\nWellington was flat and Seoul sank 0.8 percent.\n\nIn foreign exchanges, the dollar was lower against most other currencies after minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s September policy meeting showed it was growing concerned about the impact of Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\nThe central bank is expected to cut interest rates for a third time when the board meets again later this month.\n\nThe minutes \u201crevealed greater concerns over downside risk from slowing global growth and trade tensions with subdued inflation also seen as a reason to cut\u201d, said Rodrigo Catril at National Australia Bank.\n\nBut he pointed out that \u201ca few officials saw the need to push back against market Fed rate cut expectations\u201d.\n\nOil prices extended Wednesday\u2019s losses following data showing a bigger-than-forecast pick-up in US inventories that reinforced worries about the impact on demand from a global slowdown and trade frictions.\n\nThe data reversed a rally of more than one percent in the commodity that came after Turkey launched an offensive against Kurdish militants in northern Syria.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 0230 GMT \u2013\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: Up 0.5 percent at 21,555.67 (break)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: UP 0.4 percent at 25,775.22\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: UP 0.4 percent at 2,935.45\n\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.2219 from $1.2205 at 2050 GMT\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 89.92 pence from 89.89 pence\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.0987 from $1.0972\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 107.45 yen from 107.49 yen\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 21 cents at $52.38 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: DOWN 26 cents at $58.06 per barrel\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: UP 0.7 percent at 26,346.01 (close)\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: UP 0.3 percent at 7,166.50 (close)", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Asian markets rose Thursday but investors moved cautiously as they sifted through conflicting reports about the outlook for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/9adbda_top-level-trade-talks-china-united-states-in-day-are-main-point-focus-investors-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
