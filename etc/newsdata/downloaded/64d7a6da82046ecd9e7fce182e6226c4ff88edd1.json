That homey season of football, falling leaves \u2014 and of course, feting the best books of the year. The National Book Foundation did its part this week, rolling out the 50 nominees \u2014 10 each across five categories \u2014 for its annual slate of literary awards.\n\nAmong the notable names on this year's National Book Award longlists are previous winners (Colson Whitehead and Cynthia Kadohata) and plenty of newcomers to the prize, especially among the poets and nonfiction writers.\n\nThey were winnowed from more than 1,700 submissions in 2019, and they're set for another winnowing in less than a month. Judges will halve the books still in contention when they announce the shortlists of finalists on Oct. 8, and just one book in each category will claim the prize at a ceremony in New York City on Nov. 20.\n\nSo, without further ado ...\n\nFiction\n\nTaffy Brodesser-Akner, Fleishman Is in Trouble\n\nSusan Choi, Trust Exercise\n\nKali Fajardo-Anstine, Sabrina & Corina: Stories\n\nMarlon James, Black Leopard, Red Wolf\n\nLaila Lalami, The Other Americans\n\nKimberly King Parsons, Black Light: Stories\n\nHelen Phillips, The Need\n\nJulia Phillips, Disappearing Earth\n\nOcean Vuong, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous\n\nColson Whitehead, The Nickel Boys\n\nNonfiction\n\nHanif Abdurraqib, Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest\n\nSarah M.
