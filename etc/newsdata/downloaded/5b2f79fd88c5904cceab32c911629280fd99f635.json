The suit names Kemper County, the sheriff and jail employees, and alleges that despite his two-day sentence, Johnson continued to be detained unlawfully for 52 more days until he killed himself in January 2018.\n\nA lawyer for the family said it\u2019s unclear why the jail held Johnson for 52 more days beyond his two-day sentence and is still awaiting documents. The sheriff and other county officials did not respond to requests seeking clarification on the matter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s death is among the hundreds each year that make suicide the leading cause of death in local jails, occurring at more than twice the rate of state prison suicides, according to a 2019 investigation by the Associated Press and Maryland Capital News Service.\n\nIt also underscores the consequences of states such as Mississippi lacking adequate mental health care, particularly for poor and rural residents, said Cliff Johnson, who directs the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law and is representing the Johnson family in their lawsuit. (He is not related to his clients).\n\n\u201cThis story is part of a larger conversation about how people wind up in the criminal justice system rather than in appropriate mental health treatment,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAD\n\nThe 17-page complaint alleges negligence and oversights, claiming that jail staff failed to prevent the apparently suicidal Johnson from hurting himself at several turns.\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that, in the days before his death, a distraught Johnson tied torn towel strips around his neck in an apparent effort to strangle himself. It allegedly went unnoticed by staff, despite 24-hour surveillance in Johnson\u2019s dorm.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, on Jan. 9, the day Johnson died, he tied shoelaces around his neck and \u201cpulled it tightly with both hands in a manner suggesting hanging or strangulation\u201d; he later cut his wrists with a razor blade until another detainee took the blade away and alerted corrections officers. Johnson\u2019s dorm mates allegedly told the jail staff of his suicide attempts, but the staff declined to intervene, the lawsuit alleges. When Johnson got into a scuffle with his dorm mates for calling the guards on him, he was placed in an isolated observation cell. The prisoners warned the guards that Johnson could use his shoelaces to hurt himself. Instead of taking them away, the staffers allegedly dumped the shoelaces and the rest of Johnson\u2019s belongings into a rolling laundry cart before forcing Johnson into the cart.\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Johnson went unmonitored in his isolated cell for nearly 15 minutes, despite the jail\u2019s written policy that suicidal detainees be constantly watched. When a guard checked on Johnson, he was sitting unresponsive with his shoelaces wrapped around his neck and tied to the bed frame.\n\nAD\n\nIn a news conference three days after Johnson\u2019s death, Kemper County Sheriff James Moore acknowledged that the jail staff knew Johnson was harming himself and that he had a history of mental illness but did not address why Johnson was detained for so long.\n\nJohnson, the attorney, said the lawsuit strikes at nonpartisan issues: Given the lack of ideological division around the issue of improving mental health care access and curbing jail deaths, it has the rare distinction of uniting both civil rights attorneys like him and local sheriffs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question about what\u2019s humane, what\u2019s good public policy, what makes us safe,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe fact that law enforcement agrees with us that locking these people up is not the way to handle the situation is telling.\u201d\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t mention Moore specifically but said Mississippi sheriffs are in agreement that their jails aren\u2019t the right answer to the state\u2019s lack of community-based mental health services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven the state\u2019s issues with mental health access, Johnson said, it\u2019s not entirely clear if Robert Johnson would have been able to get the care he needed on his own.\n\n\u201cStill, had a local judge recognized Mr. Johnson needed to be under the care of the mental health professionals rather than locked up in a county jail, Mr. Johnson may still be alive,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAcross the United States, people with mental health needs increasingly end up in jail, rather than dedicated treatment centers: The three largest mental health facilities in the country are jails in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nAD\n\nLincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing, former president of the Mississippi Sheriffs\u2019 Association, said it\u2019s a problem local jails have fought for years. He said that compared to some of his fellow sheriffs, he\u2019s among the lucky ones.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf I have someone who comes in who is in need of mental health, [the provider] comes in and give us assistance. Not every county has that available,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past \u2014 and you hate to say it \u2014 but a person was stuck in jail until something [at a state mental health facility] was available.\u201d\n\nSize and location have something to do with it, Rushing said. He described Lincoln County, just 60 miles south of Jackson, as being in the midrange of Mississippi communities, with its population of more than 34,000. Kemper County, where Johnson died, has fewer than 10,000 people.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson, the attorney, said the systemic failures that led to Robert Johnson\u2019s death are fixable.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCertainly the Mississippi legislature is going to have to act and provide adequate funding for community mental health services,\u201d Johnson said. He said Medicaid expansion would further the efforts, particularly for the many Mississippians working in low-wage jobs that don\u2019t provide mental health care-inclusive insurance.\n\nMedicaid expansion, however, is a fraught issue in the state and is among the key issues separating candidates in the state\u2019s upcoming gubernatorial election.\n\nExpanding mental health care is only part of the solution, Johnson said.\n\n\u201c[Robert\u2019s family] want his death to highlight the need for people to receive the mental health care they need \u2014 before they wind up in a local jail,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf that can be achieved, Johnson said, it will fulfill some of what the family hopes to accomplish with the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThey also wanted people to see Robert as a complete person, who was a father and husband. Someone who was funny and who wasn\u2019t always in the same place he found himself immediately before his death.\u201d\n\nRead more:", "description": "\u201cThis story is part of a larger conversation about how people wind up in the criminal justice system rather than in appropriate mental health treatment,\u201d the family's lawyer said.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dZUJINU7o6fQg-VdkwO-aWoioqM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDWPKT5B2JERLCFNHJCG6INWAU.PNG", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
