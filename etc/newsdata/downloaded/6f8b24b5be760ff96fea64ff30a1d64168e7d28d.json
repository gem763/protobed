The person spoke under the condition of anonymity because Williamson's injury status had not yet been officially announced.\n\nThe Pelicans said in a news release Thursday that Williamson will miss the team's final preseason game \u2014 Friday night against the Knicks in New York \u2014 with right knee soreness, and that he stayed behind in New Orleans to undergo further testing.\n\nTests revealed that Williamson avoided a major injury, according to the person.\n\nWilliamson averaged 27.3 minutes per game in four preseason contests, with 23.3 points and 6.5 rebounds.\n\nIt's the same knee that Williamson sprained during his lone season at Duke, when his sneaker gave out moments into the Blue Devils' matchup against rival North Carolina.", "description": "No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson is expected to\u00a0be sidelined for the start of the NBA regular season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/18/USAT/a72940d2-4167-4ac4-b1f3-4ca9745c1ff4-Zion_injury.JPG?crop=3525,1983,x263,y15&width=2973&height=1983&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
