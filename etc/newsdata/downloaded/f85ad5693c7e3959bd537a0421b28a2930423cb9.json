REUTERS/Amy Tennery\n\nThe answer, thankfully for the organizers of this weekend\u2019s Longines Global Champions Tour show-jumping competition on New York City\u2019s Governors Island, is yes.\n\nThe premier equestrian event, which marks the circuit\u2019s finals and draws some of the sport\u2019s biggest names, demanded that 700 bales of hay, 2,600 bales of shavings, approximately 2,000 tonnes of sand and 200 bags of carrots be hauled by boat to the 172-acre tract of land, which is inaccessible by car.\n\nOrganizers had already overcome the hurdles of building stables, practice and performance arenas plus 24-hour-a-day accommodation for vets on the otherwise uninhabited island.\n\nThe Tour\u2019s Sport Director Marco Danese, who has put on show-jumping events from the sandy beaches of Miami to the Monaco Riviera, told Reuters it was a challenge worth taking on for the \u201ciconic\u201d venue he hopes will expose a new fanbase to the sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most difficult one. We cannot compare,\u201d said Danese, who oversaw the construction of an arena that boasts dazzling views of One World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty. \u201cFor the horses it was perfect.\u201d\n\nDanese brought in a separate ferry service to ensure access for riders, grooms and staff starting at five a.m. and arranged for barges to bring in supply trucks.\n\nThe three-day competition is the largest sports event ever orchestrated on the island, a seasonal refuge for urban-weary New Yorkers and tourists, according to Sarah Krautheim, a spokeswoman for the Trust for Governors Island.\n\n\u201cThey were looking for an iconic New York City venue,\u201d Krautheim told Reuters, adding that the Trust expected approximately 2,000 visitors per day at the event, which is free for those attending.\n\nThe island, which had 8,000 visitors per year when it opened to the public in 2005 and had close to one million visitors this year, regularly hosts concerts and other cultural events.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to promote a little bit our sport in different areas and to attract also people who are not familiar,\u201d said Danese.", "description": "You can lead a horse to water but can you make 95 of them board a ferry from Lower Manhattan to an island in the middle of the New York Harbor?", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434958885&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0P0-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
