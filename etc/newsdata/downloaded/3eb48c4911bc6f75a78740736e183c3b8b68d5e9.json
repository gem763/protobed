(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nTrump is proposing fulfilling the final leg of the travel plans of every caravan working its way through Mexico.\n\nPresident Trump is looking into giving a free trip to San Francisco, New Orleans, or other great American cities to tens of thousands of refugees from Central America. All so he can own the libs.\n\n\u201cOwning the libs\u201d is one of those phrases to have emerged over the past few years that vacillates between earnestness and irony. For people who use it earnestly, it means to do something, usually symbolic and petty, that infuriates liberals out of proportion to the deed to make fools of them. For instance, wearing a MAGA hat to a feminist poetry reading at a co-op bookstore in Berkeley. It\u2019s a form of taking the culture war to the enemy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ironic form of the phrase is to engage in unwitting self-sabotage while making a political point. When pro-Trump Internet troll and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec (now a \u201ccorrespondent\u201d at One America News) had his wedding rehearsal dinner catered by Papa John\u2019s Pizza \u2014 then unpopular with the libs \u2014 that was some righteous lib-ownage. Hence one Twitter user\u2019s response to Posobiec catering choices: \u201cEating horrible pizza at my wedding to own the libs.\u201d\n\n(There\u2019s even a Twitter account called \u201cOwn The Libs Bot\u201d (@OwnTheLibsBot) that churns out made-up but often all-too-plausible examples of ironic lib-owning: \u201cDefending pederasty to own the libs.\u201d \u201cGetting a Confederate flag face tattoo to own the libs.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of Trump\u2019s populist appeal stems from his willingness to go out of his way to own the libs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGive the president credit: He is a kind of savant at the genre, particularly in his preferred m\u00e9tier of Twitter. Tweeting footage of the 9/11 attacks while criticizing Representative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) last week is a good example, but his Colin Kaepernick tweets and calls to revoke media broadcast licenses are part of the canon. His defenders think this stuff is brilliant because it keeps the base riled up and, allegedly, produces gallons of delicious liberal tears. When you point out that such tweets offend more voters than they attract, \u201cShut up,\u201d they explain.\n\nBut no lib-owning tweet can hold a candle to Trump\u2019s announcement over the weekend that he is considering busing thousands of refugees to \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany conservative commentators have celebrated this triumph of lib-owning, even as they concede in mumbled parentheticals that it won\u2019t actually happen \u2014 not least because it\u2019s almost certainly illegal without congressional authorization, which will never materialize. But some conservatives continue to defend Trump\u2019s theatrics on the grounds that people should take him seriously but not literally. But taken either way, the idea is nuttier than a squirrel\u2019s preferred last meal.\n\nStemming illegal (and sometimes legal) immigration is the president\u2019s signature issue. Moving the thousands of refugees currently in detention to sanctuary cities is literally achieving the opposite of his goal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, the reason there\u2019s a refugee crisis at the border is that desperate Central Americans believe this is their now-or-never moment to get asylum in the United States. What will happen when video of buses depositing refugees in Colorado, Vermont, or Oregon is broadcast across South America?\n\nTrump keeps asserting that these refugees are an army of invading murderers, rapists, and drug dealers \u2014 and apparently, he thinks most Americans believe him. So of course, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other San Francisco liberals must be terrified that the president has called their bluff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thing is, most immigrants who are in the United States illegally end up going to these very localities. Sixty percent of them reside in just 20 metro areas, most of which have adopted sanctuary policies and limited their cooperation with immigration enforcement. In other words, Trump is proposing fulfilling the final leg of the travel plans of every caravan working its way through Mexico.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump made Kate Steinle, the San Francisco woman who was tragically shot and killed by a man who\u2019d been previously deported five times, into a martyr for his cause. Trump\u2019s logic suggests we need more Kate Steinles to own the libs.\n\nTrump\u2019s trolling could pay off if some Democrats \u2014 say, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2014 call on Pelosi and Congress to take the president up on his offer. Then, Trump could say, \u201cSee! The Democrats really do want open borders!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat such a scenario is not unimaginable is further proof that our politics can always get dumber.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
