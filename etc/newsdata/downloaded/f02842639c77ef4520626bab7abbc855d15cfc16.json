McCormack on Friday indicated that he wants to see the Trump donors' names revealed so that Hollywood Democrats could refuse to work with them in the future.\n\n\"Kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with,\" he tweeted.\n\n\n\nHey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with. Thx. https://t.co/7W3xPG3bI2 \u2014 Eric McCormack (@EricMcCormack) August 30, 2019\n\n\n\nThe actor took heat for his request, with some drawing comparisons to the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy, whose efforts to oust communists from American spheres of influence led to a Hollywood blacklist of those seen as disloyal to the United States.\n\n\n\nHey @jack is this tweet openly threatening to \u201cblacklist\u201d American Citizens in Hollywood okay for the good of society? Just asking for a friend. \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/nsy3OhQljP \u2014 Isaiah Washington (@IWashington) August 30, 2019\n\nHow dare someone have an opinion that is not the same as yours? What is this? America? \u2014 Carmine Sabia (@CarmineSabia) August 30, 2019\n\nHow wonderfully fascist of you @EricMcCormack ! Yes, how dare anyone in a FREE COUNTRY actually be FREE to support someone that you don\u2019t or have an opinion that differs from yours. Anyone that doesn\u2019t get in line with your opinion should absolutely be blacklisted from work. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u2014 Maeve Quinlan (@maevequinlan) August 31, 2019\n\n\n\nThe Beverly Hills event is scheduled for the week of the Emmy Awards, with tickets starting at $1,000.
