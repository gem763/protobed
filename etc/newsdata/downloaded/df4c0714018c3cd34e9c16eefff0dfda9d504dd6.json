Biden in next year\u2019s election.\n\nMr. Yang, a 44-year-old businessman who is rising in the polls among Democratic presidential candidates, appeared at an event hosted by The Washington Post and was asked if he was willing to potentially run on the same ticket as Mr. Biden in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely open to working with Joe. We\u2019ve actually talked about it,\u201d Mr. Yang responded.\n\nRepresentatives for the Biden campaign did not immediately return an inquiry from The Washington Times.\n\nMr. Yang and Mr. Biden are both currently among more than a dozen candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to compete in 2020 against President Trump.\n\nPolling has largely placed Mr. Biden, 76, as one of the Democratic front-runners since before he entered the race in April.\n\nMr. Yang, a political neophyte, has recently polled among the top 10 candidates, meanwhile, in many instances outperforming candidates with years of experience on Capitol Hill.\n\nSpeaking at The Post\u2019s headquarters, Mr. Yang said that he would not mount a third-party campaign if the Democratic nomination goes to a different candidate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s had some crazy native desire to be president of the United States since I was a kid because I\u2019m not insane,\u201d Mr. Yang said.\n\nHe indicated he is willing to remain in politics if he can be of assistance in the next administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a parent, I\u2019m a patriot. I just want to help solve the problems of this era,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cI believe I can do that best as president, but if that\u2019s at some other capacity, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
