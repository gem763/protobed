Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed a bill, AB44, passed through the state senate last month, banning all sales and manufacture of new fur products in the state. Newsom on Twitter described the bill as \u201cone of the strongest animal rights laws in U.S. history.\u201d It also makes California the first state in the nation to adopt such a law.\n\nMore from WWD\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a leader when it comes to animal welfare and today that leadership includes banning the sale of fur,\u201d Newsom wrote in a statement.\n\nAB44 applies to all apparel and accessories that would contain fur, from coats to keychains, but used or vintage fur products are exempt. It also exempts leather, cowhide and shearling (materials that often make their way to market as part of the food industry and would be otherwise wasted), as well as \u201cfur products used for religious purposes.\u201d There are further provisions for the exemption of taxidermy products and fur from animals lawfully taken while hunting.\n\nIn addition to the fur sales ban, the governor signed a package of other new animal rights laws, including a ban on the slaughter of horses, the use of wild animals in circuses, an extension on an already enacted ban on the trade of dead animal parts and a ban on the trapping or killing of bobcats in the state. He also last month signed into law a ban on fur trapping and earlier this year the City of Los Angeles banned fur sales.\n\n\u201cWe are making a statement to the world that beautiful wild animals like bears and tigers have no place on trapeze wires or jumping through flames,\u201d Newsom added. \u201cJust YouTube the videos showing the cruel way these animals \u2014 often stripped from their mothers as babies \u2014 are trained to do dangerous tricks. It\u2019s deeply disturbing.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s move was widely applauded by animal rights groups. PETA vice president Tracy Reiman said the group was \u201cproud to have worked with compassionate legislators to push these lifesaving laws forward and looks to other states to follow California\u2019s progressive lead.\u201d\n\nKitty Block, chief executive officer of the Humane Society, said the ban on new fur sales \u201cunderscores the point that today\u2019s consumers simply don\u2019t want wild animals to suffer extreme pain and fear for the sake of fashion.\u201d\n\nBlock added: \u201cMore cities and states are expected to follow California\u2019s lead and the few brands and retailers that still sell fur will no doubt take a look at innovative alternatives that don\u2019t involve animal cruelty.\u201d\n\nThe Humane Society also positioned California\u2019s move \u2014 which comes after many major brands, including Chanel, Prada, Gucci, Burberry and more, over the last few years went ahead and halted the use of fur in their products and designs \u2014 as putting \u201chuge pressure\u201d on the U.K. government to adopt a similar ban on the sale of fur.\n\nMarylin Kroplick, president of In Defense of Animals, an animal rights group that supported AB44, praised the enactment of the bill and said the group \u201cwill continue to work with dedicated activists and organizations to make fur history across the U.S and around the world.\u201d\n\nThere are pro-fur groups, however, that have tried to lobby against the ban on fur and fur-related activities. The Truth About Fur is one such group and its argument in favor of fur largely rests on the logic that increasingly popular fake fur, typically made from petrochemicals and plastics, is more harmful for the environment than the \u201cwell-regulated\u201d killing of animals for fur. The group is run by several pro-fur groups and lobbies, like the Canada Mink Breeders Association and Fur Commission USA. The groups also all cite a PwC study from 2012 that estimated global fur sales to be worth $35 billion. In North America, retail sales of fur in 2013 were estimated to be around $1 billion, according to research from the Fur Information Council of America.\n\nThe council\u2019s Keith Kaplan criticized the bill and Governor Newsom\u2019s passage of it, saying he \u201cfailed to recognize the human toll,\u201d arguing fur-producing businesses will be forced to close \u201cwith no compensation to the business owners.\u201d However, business listings in the state show just over a dozen companies listed as participating in fur farming, almost all dealing in mink. Fur Commission USA stopped \u201crevealing\u201d the number of fur farms in the U.S. in 2012.", "description": "Governor Gavin Newsom made California the first state to enact such a ban.
