REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nChina for its part expressed confidence in Lam and her government but said it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets of the former British colony since mid-June in sometimes violent protests against now-suspended draft legislation that could have seen people sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party controlled courts.\n\nLam told business leaders last week that she had caused \u201cunforgivable havoc\u201d by introducing the bill and that if she had a choice she would apologize and resign, according to a leaked audio recording.\n\nLam told a televised news conference that she had never considered asking to resign and that Beijing believed her government could solve the three-month-long crisis without China\u2019s intervention.\n\n\u201cI have not even contemplated discussing a resignation with the central people\u2019s government. The choice of resigning, it\u2019s my own choice,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cI told myself repeatedly in the last three months that I and my team should stay on to help Hong Kong ... That\u2019s why I said that I have not given myself the choice to take an easier path and that is to leave.\u201d\n\nLam added that she was disappointed that comments made in a private meeting, where she had been sharing the \u201cjourney of my heart\u201d, had been leaked.\n\nAt a news conference given by China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing, no questions were raised directly about the Lam tape, and a spokesman and spokeswoman did not refer to it or the Reuters story.\n\nThey denounced the violence and Western countries seeking to use the Hong Kong issue to interfere in China\u2019s affairs, and reiterated that China would never tolerate Hong Kong independence or a leader who was not loyal to Beijing.\n\nThe central government firmly supported Lam and her government, they said. But it would not sit by forever if the violence continued, spokeswoman Xu Luying said.\n\n\u201cThe central government will not allow chaos in Hong Kong to continue indefinitely,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf the situation in Hong Kong continues to worsen and it becomes turmoil that cannot be controlled by the SAR government and endangers the country\u2019s sovereignty and security, the central government will not sit idly by.\u201d\n\nSAR refers to the \u201cspecial administrative region\u201d of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Global Times, a widely read Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily, denounced the Reuters story in an editorial on their website.\n\n\u201cReuters and other Western media have been entangled in the fake news that \u2018Carrie Lam\u2019s resignation has not been approved\u2019 for some time, a serious infringement of the bottom line of professional ethics.\n\n\u201cThey are not objectively reporting facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cTWO MASTERS\u201d\n\nThe growing unrest in Hong Kong has evolved into a broader call for Hong Kong to be granted greater autonomy by Beijing, which has often accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.\n\nComments on the Reuters story about Lam appeared to be censored on mainland Chinese social media, although state media covered Lam\u2019s news conference.\n\nIn the audio recording, Lam said that her ability to resolve the crisis was \u201cvery, very limited\u201d as she had to serve \u201ctwo masters\u201d and the issue had been elevated \u201cto a national level\u201d, a reference to the leadership in Beijing.\n\nBut Lam said on Tuesday that her government had the confidence of Beijing and could bring an end to unrest itself.\n\nHong Kong school and university students boycotted classes and held rallies for a second straight day, calling for what protesters call their \u201cfive demands\u201d.\n\nOther than the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill, protesters want the retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police and the right for Hongkongers to democratically choose their own leaders.\n\nUnder Hong Kong law, rioting can carry a 10-year prison sentence.\n\nLam has said she is open to dialogue with protesters but has made no concessions on these demands.\n\n\u201cI think Carrie Lam doesn\u2019t have much power,\u201d said Poon, a 21-year-old engineering student at Hong Kong University.\n\n\u201cNo matter she can step down or not, it doesn\u2019t matter. Chief executive is still chosen by the central government. What matters is she refuses to response to the five demands. She\u2019s an irresponsible leader.\u201d\n\nThe weekend was marred by some of the worst violence since the unrest escalated more than three months ago, with protesters burning barricades and throwing petrol bombs, and police retaliating with water cannon, tear gas and batons.\n\nThousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday. Some then targeted the MTR subway station in nearby Tung Chung, ripping out turnstiles and smashing CCTV cameras, glass panels and lamps with metal poles.\n\nPolice have arrested more than 1,140 people since the protests began, including high-profile activists like Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of the pro-democracy \u201cUmbrella\u201d movement five years ago that foreshadowed the current unrest.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees wide-ranging autonomy, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary.\n\nThe protesters fear those freedoms are being slowly eroded by Beijing, a charge China vehemently denies, saying China is its business and no one else\u2019s.\n\nWith Hong Kong facing its first recession in a decade, speculation has grown that the city government may impose emergency laws, giving it extra powers over detentions, censorship and curfews.\n\nLam said her government was considering all legal avenues to solve the crisis.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she had never asked the Chinese government to let her resign to end the Chinese-ruled city's political crisis, responding to a Reuters report about a recording of her saying she would step down if she could.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425786907&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF82060-OCATP"}
