Save The Children estimates there are 9,000 of them, with more than 40 different nationalities, languishing in Kurdish-run camps. Some are Canadian.\n\nAnd recent Turkish military action in northern Syria means things have gotten even more desperate for those children and their families.\n\nBritish officials have begun the process of repatriating some of those children with the help of aid agencies, the Guardian reported Monday. Save The Children, a non-profit that helps children in war zones and disaster areas, is calling on Canada and other countries to do the same.\n\nSonia Khush, the Syria country director for Save the Children, spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nWhat have conditions been like for children in these camps since the Turkish operation began?\n\nThe conditions are really difficult for children right now because the situation is so uncertain. There have been more than 176,000 people who have been displaced over the last week.\n\nConditions were already pretty bad in these camps, right? Can you get access to the children to assess their needs and to see how they're being cared for?\n\nAcross the shelters and the camps, conditions are really difficult. It's not a good place for a child to grow up. But at this point, there seem to be very few options for them.\n\nSave The Children estimates there are 9,000 children with links to foreign ISIS fighters languishing in Syrian camps.

What have they been exposed to? What are they seeing? What [have] they experienced?\n\nThe main impact that we see is on their mental health and well-being. So they are not radicalized, but rather they are dealing with the consequences of having lived under such a violent environment. A lot of them talk about having witnessed beheadings, or seen just so much violence in their daily life and on the streets.\n\nAnd living in a camp isn't giving them the safe and secure environment and support that they need to recover from having lived under such violent conditions.\n\nSo we're urgently calling for, especially for the foreign children, to be taken home back to their home countries so that they have a chance at recovering and having healthy and happy childhoods.\n\nHave you encountered Canadians in your travels?\n\nThe Canadian children we meet, they're not going to school. They're not getting the psychological support they need from having lived under violent conditions. They are really missing out on a healthy and happy childhood. And they talked to us about wanting to go back to Canada, wanting to get an education, to be in school.\n\nChildren are the same everywhere. They just want to learn and be happy and play. And, unfortunately, that's not really an option for them right now where they're living.\n\nAnd what are you hearing as far as response from the government of Canada and other foreign governments about whether or not they're going to help repatriate these children?\n\nSome governments have willingly taken back women and children. Some examples are Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo. Some countries have taken back orphans. You know, it's been a real mixed bag.\n\nBut from our perspective, all children \u2014 even those that are there with their mothers \u2014 are innocent. They didn't ask to be taken to Syria. They didn't ask to be born in Syria. And they just as equally deserve the chance to come home and be safe and protected.\n\nSo we really strongly urge all governments, including the government of Canada, to bring their citizens home.\n\nWomen look after children at the al-Hol camp on Thursday.

(Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIf the children must come home with their parents, can you appreciate that it might be, for Canada and other countries, very difficult to consider that, given that these people, the parents, are quite radicalized?\n\nWe have a lot of trust in the justice systems of countries back home to deal with individual cases and act accordingly.\n\nBut in the meantime, at least the children are home and they're safe and they're healthy and they're protected and they have a chance at having a productive life \u2014 which they don't have right now in that camp.\n\nA picture taken on Oct. 17, 2019, shows the conditions for children who live at the Kurdish-run al-Hol camp. (Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nI guess the arguments have been that ... it's very difficult to bring them to justice because it's impossible to gather the evidence that would be required in a Canadian legal system. So is that the kind of quandary that these children are now sort of in?\n\nYes, I understand that complication as well. It just seems like children are now paying the price of decisions that their parents made.\n\nAnd for us looking at the well-being of children, I would just hope that a mechanism could be found to address this legal issue in such a way that children are not punished \u2014 because the fact is, they're innocent in all of this. And our priority really needs to be getting those more than 9,000 children out of northeast Syria.\n\nYou know, when you go to these camps, you just see so many children under the age of five running around with no opportunity to learn or get proper health care or be safe. And it really makes you realize that most of these children are just so small. There's no reason they should be growing up in a dusty camp in northeast Syria.\n\nAnd we know that it's very volatile in the region. What are your greatest concerns about what might happen to those children over this winter?\n\nWe're concerned, obviously, with winter conditions. It's very difficult to live in camps in northeastern Syria during the winter.\n\nThe larger issue, though, is the current uncertainty in northeast Syria. We know right now that the Kurdish authorities control the area where the camps are, and they've been quite willing to facilitate repatriations.\n\nIf another group takes control over these areas, including the camps \u2014 whether it's the government of Syria, or whether it's another armed group, or whoever it may be \u2014 then all bets are off.\n\nSo our call is while the Kurdish authorities are still in charge, that this is a really excellent time to repatriate children.\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear.
