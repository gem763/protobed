(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)\n\nBiologists from the United Kingdom think they\u2019ve decoded the mystery of all the gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) running around the United States with black fur.\n\nThe bit of genetic code that causes the gray squirrel species to turn black, they showed, is an allele, or a variant form of a specific gene, called MC1R\u220624. But that allele doesn\u2019t seem to come from gray squirrels. Instead, they showed, the gray squirrel MC1R\u220624 allele is \u201cidentical\u201d to the MC1R\u220624 allele found in another species, fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) \u2014 one of two mutations that occasionally cause big, usually reddish fox squirrels to turn black. In a paper published online July 11 in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology, the researchers showed that the color-changing allele probably originated in fox squirrels and moved over to gray squirrels through interbreeding.\n\nTo reach that conclusion, the researchers examined all three possible ways the gene variant could have turned up in both species.\n\n\u201cFirst, the allele could have arisen in the common ancestor of both species, and been retained by balancing selection,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn other words, because black coloring offers some advantages to squirrels (helping them stay warm in the winter, for example), it\u2019s possible that the gene is old and just stuck around as the two species diverged.\n\nBut over millennia of evolution, they wrote, the group of alleles (called haplotypes) that included this \u201cblack fur\u201d gene variant would have probably stopped being identical in the two species, if that were the case.\n\n\u201cSecond, the mutation could have arisen independently in both species, but this is also unlikely as the haplotypes are identical,\u201d they wrote. \u201cTherefore the most likely explanation is that the MC1R\u220624 allele arose in one species and subsequently introgressed to the other species.\u201d\n\nWhy Do Squirrels Chase Each Other?\n\nThey concluded that the gene probably started in fox squirrels and moved over to gray squirrels because it more closely resembles other genes that are common in fox squirrels \u2014 but they added that they can\u2019t rule out the theory that the allele started in gray squirrels and moved in the opposite direction.\n\nWhatever the case, they wrote, black fur remains a rare thing for squirrels in North America, occurring at rates of less than 1 percent in the two species. But already, they noted in a statement, it\u2019s made its way over to the United Kingdom \u2014 probably through black squirrels from the United States that escaped from private zoos in the U.K.\n\n\u2014 Live Science\n\nRead more\n\nFrench bulldogs\u2019 cuteness comes at a steep cost\n\nTen top species success stories\n\nA dachshund swelled to 3 times his size and \u2018crackled like bubble wrap.\u2019 Surgery saved him", "description": "The researchers say the population change has to do with genetics and some cross-species courtships.", "authors": ["Rafi Letzter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iXOOkfak4wxH4j6q-U5-ux7MoQs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K65WSPV7PQI6TODTMOWOMNVPBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
