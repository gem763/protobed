(Cliff Owen/Associated Press)\n\nPlans for U.S. troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, in keeping with President Trump\u2019s pledge to end the war there, were thrown into confusion Sunday, following Trump\u2019s decision to call off a secret meeting he planned with Afghan and Taliban leaders to secure a peace deal.\n\nCompeting versions of what led to the cancellation of the meeting and, at least temporarily, any further U.S.-Taliban negotiations, exposed internal administration tensions that have flared as a deal seemed near in recent weeks.\n\nThose tensions have pitted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose chief negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, said a week ago that agreement \u201cin principle\u201d had been reached after 10 months of talks with the militants, and Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who opposed the talks.\n\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d Pompeo said in response to questions about whether the initial drawdown of at least 5,000 troops \u2014 more than a third of the total currently in Afghanistan \u2014 planned for early next year would be delayed, along with a subsequent full withdrawal tentatively planned to take place by the end of 2020. In exchange, the Taliban were to pledge to cut ties with al-Qaeda and support counterterrorism efforts.\n\nBut \u201cany reduction in our forces will be based on actual conditions\u201d on the ground, Pompeo said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d one of five Sunday television interviews he gave after Trump\u2019s surprise announcement, made late Saturday on Twitter, about the planned Sunday meeting at Camp David.\n\n[Afghans welcome cancellation of peace talks with Taliban]\n\nThe Defense Department, Pompeo said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d has \u201cfull authority to do what they need to do\u201d to protect U.S. forces and prevent another terrorist attack like the one on Sept. 11, 2001, the 18th anniversary of which is Wednesday. Asked whether U.S. troops would remain in Afghanistan at their current level of more than 14,000, Pompeo told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question. Ultimately, it\u2019s the president\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nBut others said that Trump was likely to move ahead with the planned initial withdrawal, regardless of the apparent collapse of negotiations. One official familiar with White House deliberations cast Trump\u2019s cancellation of the meeting \u2014 which the president said was in response to the death on Thursday of a U.S. soldier in a Taliban attack, one of 16 killed since the beginning of this year \u2014 as part of a broader victory for Bolton.\n\nTrump was the main person pushing for the Camp David meeting, according to a senior administration official who, like others who discussed the sensitive issue, spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Comparing the initiative to Trump\u2019s personal meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and his stated desire to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, this official said Trump thinks his personal style can persuade anyone, and that he has seen the possibility of a substantial Afghan withdrawal as a major plus for his reelection campaign.\n\nWhile many in the administration have questioned the Taliban talks, Pompeo and Bolton have been at loggerheads over this issue and others, with Bolton, a well-known hawk, charging that Pompeo was trying to \u201cbox him out\u201d of decision-making on Afghanistan.\n\nBolton had expressed his reservations about the deal at the time Khalilzad briefed Trump on its terms in late August, according to the official familiar with White House deliberations.\n\nWhile State Department officials said that Trump indicated during that meeting that he was provisionally satisfied with the deal, and authorized Khalilzad to move forward, this official said the president had not approved a final agreement, and that Bolton had continued to advocate another path. Bolton, the official said, had been in direct communication with Khalilzad, the White House of chief of staff, and the president outside of Pompeo\u2019s presence.\n\nBolton has not opposed reducing the current U.S. troop level to 8,600 \u2014 about the number in Afghanistan when Trump took office \u2014 but rejects any deal with the Taliban. His view is that the president can meet his campaign promise of withdrawal without a deal, and can simply decide on a reduction.\n\n[Bolton sidelined from Afghanistan policy as his standing with Trump falters]\n\nAn official familiar with the State Department approach declined to address those remarks but noted that Pompeo is careful to never allow daylight to appear between him and the president. This official pointed out that Pompeo was designated to represent the administration on all five major Sunday morning talk shows. That feat is known as \u201cthe full Ginsburg,\u201d a reference to William H. Ginsburg, the lawyer representing Monica Lewinsky during the Bill Clinton sexual scandals, who was the first to achieve it.\n\nThere was little disagreement that events of the weekend will probably lead to increased violence in Afghanistan. Pompeo denied extensive reports that the Taliban had made significant battlefield gains in recent months. \u201cIf you\u2019re the Taliban, conditions have been worsening. And they\u2019re about to get worse,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou should know in the last 10 days we\u2019ve killed over a thousand Taliban,\u201d Pompeo told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cAnd while this is not a war of attrition, I want the American people to know that President Trump is taking it to the Taliban in an effort to make sure that we protect America\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban said that the decision to end the U.S.-Taliban peace process for now would \u201clead to more losses for the United States,\u201d spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement. \u201cIts credibility will be affected, its anti-peace stance will be exposed to the world, losses to lives and assets will increase.\u201d\n\nIn tweets sent Saturday evening, Trump said that he had canceled the arrival of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and \u201cthe major Taliban leaders\u201d after the death of Army Sgt. 1st Class Elis Angel Barreto Ortiz, 34, who was killed on Thursday in a Taliban attack. \u201cIf they cannot agree to a cease-fire during these very important peace talks . . . they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d Trump asked.\n\nU.S. officials said the decision to cancel the Camp David meeting, which had been in the planning stages for more than a week, was made on Thursday. The senior administration official said that Trump decided to tweet about its existence, and its cancellation, on Saturday evening to \u201ccontrol the narrative.\u201d\n\nAs controversy about the status of the Taliban talks swept Washington and Kabul on Sunday, the president, who spent the day playing golf, did not mention it again amid tweets about presidential adviser Ivanka Trump\u2019s travels in South America and his planned political rally in North Carolina on Monday.\n\nThe Afghan president apparently was not informed about the cancellation decision until Friday. His office said that morning, without giving details, that Ghani planned to travel to Washington over the weekend for consultations. Later in the day, officials said his travel had been \u201cpostponed.\u201d\n\nIt was also unclear when Khalilzad, who had left Kabul for final talks with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday, was informed, or whether the militants had ever actually been asked, or agreed, to come to Washington.\n\nIn his statement Sunday, Mujahid said that \u201cthe American negotiating team was satisfied until yesterday about the progress made so far and we ended the talks in a good atmosphere. Both sides were prepared for announcing the agreement and for signing it.\u201d\n\nAn \u201cintra-Afghan meeting and dialogue\u201d had been scheduled for Sept. 23, \u201cafter the announcement of the signing of the deal,\u201d the statement said. Direct Taliban talks with the Afghan government were demanded by Ghani, and were part of the agreement Khalilzad negotiated. Those talks were also to include discussion of a cease-fire in the war.\n\nOfficials involved in the negotiations have long said that the Taliban\u2019s position during the talks was to continue fighting until a cease-fire agreement was reached, and that they had expected violence to increase in the lead-up to a deal.\n\nIn his Sunday interviews, Pompeo defended the initial decision for Trump to meet with the Taliban at Camp David and argued that the president had been willing to take a political risk to achieve a deal on reducing the U.S. troop presence.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to negotiate peace, you often to have to deal with some pretty bad actors,\u201d he said on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nBut others have sharply criticized the negotiations, including a group of former U.S. ambassadors to Afghanistan who said it could make things worse. And some Republicans quickly dismissed the Camp David idea.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 Republican in the House, tweeted after Pompeo\u2019s TV appearances. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should ever set foot there. Ever.\u201d\n\nJosh Dawsey and Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report.", "description": "It remains unclear whether planned troop withdrawals will proceed as the Taliban vows that the end of the peace process will lead to the loss of additional American lives.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "September At Pm", "Karen Deyoung Is Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent For The Post.
