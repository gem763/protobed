As you do.\n\nTaking to the red carpet, the 21-year-old donned thigh-high boots and a snake-print dress as she wrapped the reptile around her.\n\nHowever, not everyone was a fan, with some branding it animal cruelty.\n\n2001 was a wild time (Picture: WireImage)\n\nFans and critics alike came together to point out it wasn\u2019t right that she was using a live animal as an accessory, with many angered that she would even be compared to the Toxic singer.\n\nAnd Tana\u2019s Halloween costume last year didn\u2019t fare much better after she defended her \u2018sexualised\u2019 JoJo Siwa look.\n\nPeople were less than impressed by her take on the costume, which saw her scantily clad in just a bra, thong, tutu and fish-net tights.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Tana\u2019s channeled Britney (Picture: REX)\n\nMany criticised her for sexualising the 16-year-old, who usually dresses in tshirts and hoodies, with her trademark side ponytail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefending the costume, Tana wrote: \u2018Saw some tweets about my Jojo costume and I just wanna clarify before things get crazy- Jojo is a great friend of mine & I would never intend to sexualize HER, I literally think that anything like that is gross as f***.\n\n\u2018It was just like a slutty schoolgirl costume, girl scout, or cheerleader to me,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018I totally didn\u2019t see it that way and would never want to! I LOVE Jojo and making crazy halloween costumes and she was telling me to do it! just wanted to let u know my standpoint on that before I see anything else.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
