Though in need of complete modernization and refurbishment, \u201cthe house offers an incredible opportunity to purchase a real slice of history and for the buyer to improve and personalise to their own specifications,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Three \u00a310M-Plus Mansions Hit Guernsey\u2019s Tiny Property Market This Week\n\nThe five-bedroom home has retained many period features, including fireplaces and exposed beams, according to the listing.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a reception hall with a flagstone and tiled floor, a sitting room with a decorative plaster ceiling and a master bedroom with views across the countryside.\n\nGardens surround the house on three sides, and outbuildings include a thatched shed, storage rooms, and a brick and flint building known as Chapel Barn, thought to be a former chapel and now used as a garage with more storage.\n\n\n\nMansion Global could not determine the current owner of the home.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-113494?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280"}
