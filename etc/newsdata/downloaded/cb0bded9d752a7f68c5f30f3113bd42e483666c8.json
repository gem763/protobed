He wants a clear definition of the American strategic interest across the globe and a commitment that war is always a tool of last resort.\n\nHis stubborn loyalty to those two objectives sometimes is derided as nationalistic and non-interventionist by his critics.\n\nBut for those of us old enough to remember, those principles used to be endemic to U.S. foreign policy for decades, until Bill Clinton and Barack Obama took the Iranian appeasement bait and George W. Bush mispositioned America as the unrelenting, trigger-happy global cop.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe murky foreign policies of the past two decades moved America away from defining its strategic interest on each global issue to a more populist, hair-trigger approach, giving us such blunders as Bush\u2019s bogus Iraq WMD claim and Obama\u2019s feckless erosion of a red line in Syria.\n\nWith John Bolton\u2019s departure as the president\u2019s national security adviser on Tuesday, President Trump Donald John TrumpOnly Congress can end the China trade war quagmire Trump blasts Bolton: 'He made some very big mistakes' Trump seeks ban on flavored e-cigarettes MORE has the rare opportunity to restore the American strategic interest to foreign policy and create a clear global doctrine to govern for years to come.\n\nBut it will require something he hasn\u2019t always done well \u2014 picking the right people.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not the blustery media persona, which the relentless neocon Bolton offered, or the flashy uniforms of Gens. Kelly, McMasters and Mattis, or the establishment appeasement that Dan Coats presented that work best on the senior team.\n\nRather, it\u2019s finding the strategic executioners who share the president\u2019s policy vision or can, at the very least, subjugate personal ego to carry out the president\u2019s plan with determination, clarity and competence.\n\nNew Attorney General William Barr has shown the difference that very approach makes in corralling and calming a wayward Justice Department after the Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d fiasco. Secretary Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump issues Taliban warning at Sept. 11 memorial US commemorates 18th anniversary of 9/11 Rocket explodes at US Embassy in Afghanistan on anniversary of 9/11 attacks MORE has done the same at State after Rex Tillerson\u2019s diplomatic equivalent of a toxic oil spill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump has two candidates \u2014 both confirmed by the Senate to other jobs on his watch \u2014 who can rival Barr\u2019s and Pompeo\u2019s contributions by stepping into the vacant, critical roles of national security adviser (NSA) and director of national intelligence (DNI).\n\nThe first is Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, who has shown remarkable competence in downsizing the once-giant European Union lioness Angela Merkel on the world stage and achieving numerous strategic wins for America from Berlin.\n\nAlmost immediately upon his arrival in Berlin, Grenell punched like a heavyweight when he finally got the reluctant Germans to extradite a 95-year-old Nazi labor camp guard who had sought safe haven in New York City for decades.\n\nMultiple U.S. administrations had vowed to get the job done. Trump and Grenell were the ones who succeeded.\n\nGrenell also:\n\ngalled the Europeans to up the ante on their anemic NATO spending \u2014 a key strategic goal for Trump;\n\n\n\n\n\npersuaded the Germans to open new liquid natural gas facilities for U.S. exports;\n\nrelentlessly pressured the Germans to resist a new Russian gas pipeline known as Nord Stream 2; and\n\nsuccessfully forced the Germans to block an Iranian airline from servicing the country.\n\nAnd just this week Grenell showed the power of his bully pulpit in softening Berlin\u2019s resistance to banning Hezbollah from Germany.\n\nThe list of accomplishments proves Grenell can get done what Trump wants done with his take-no-hostages approach to winning. He also loves Twitter about as much as the president, which creates a natural affinity.\n\nBut Grenell, a student of Bolton, also brings one trait that his former boss \u2014 however brilliant \u2014 sometimes lacked: the ability to pragmatically place strategic interests ahead of ideology.\n\nMy sources tell me Bolton resisted the idea that American oil and energy companies should stay on the ground during Venezuela\u2019s upheaval. For Bolton, it was a principled stand. But for much of the rest of Trump\u2019s national security team, the importance of keeping America business interests on the ground until the Maduro regime falls was essential to ensuring Russia and China don\u2019t steal that strategic foothold.\n\nThe ability to discern such opportunity is important for an NSA.\n\nPompeo may be tempted to pressure Trump to install one of the secretary of State\u2019s own allies, such as Iranian-crisis envoy Brian Hook, into the NSA job. While Pompeo\u2019s word should always carry weight, Hook\u2019s selection would repeat a mistake Trump has made multiple times in elevating a onetime critic into a trusted position.\n\nHook helped found the John Hay Initiative, a group of ex-Mitt Romney foreign policy advisers who organized a prominent letter in 2016, signed by 121 conservative thought-leaders, arguing that Trump would make America less safe. Though Hook did not sign the letter himself, he made clear his criticism of the eventual 45th president.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHook has done a strong job as the Iran point man and is better served staying there than taking on the NSA job, where his past criticisms of his boss almost certainly would endanger his authority to lead.\n\nLike Grenell, another ambassador in Europe, former Congressman Peter Hoekstra, who is America\u2019s top diplomat to the Netherlands, could help fill an essential void as the DNI.\n\nCoats never really clicked with Trump and slow-walked important transparency opportunities that would have exposed problems with the Russia probe, including the declassification of important congressional interviews.\n\nHoekstra was respected by both parties as the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, understands the intelligence community well and enjoys the president\u2019s confidence. And he brings a commonsense Midwesterner\u2019s approach to getting things done without the need for personal glory.\n\nWith Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, Russia, Syria and many more foreign challenges brewing, Trump needs a unified, competent national security team capable of oaring in a single direction.\n\nIf he gets these next two personnel picks right, he also has a chance to cement the Trump doctrine that defines the American interest clearly in each country and reserves the might of the American military as a last resort. In so doing he will fulfill another promise he made as a candidate.\n\nJohn Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists\u2019 misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption.
