He signed off with a brief statement, surprising even his colleagues. Fox News said Friday\u2019s program would be Smith\u2019s last.\n\nSmith has been at Fox News since its founding in 1996 and is one of its signature figures. He was among the first people hired by Fox News\u2019s co-founder, the late Roger Ailes, for the network\u2019s launch. His recent tenure, however, has been marked by conflict and criticism, not just from President Trump but from within the network itself.\n\nThe internal tensions at Fox News appear to have contributed to his resignation, according to multiple people at the network and those close to Smith, who spoke to The Washington Post for this story. Smith was also in the middle of a long-term contract, making his resignation \u2014 and Fox\u2019s agreement to release him \u2014 highly unusual.\n\nEarlier this month, he engaged in an extraordinary war of words with Tucker Carlson, one of the network\u2019s most popular opinion hosts. Smith called Carlson \u201crepugnant\u201d for not defending Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano when a guest on Carlson\u2019s program called Napolitano \u201ca fool\u201d for criticizing Trump\u2019s efforts to gain damaging information on Democratic rival Joe Biden from the president of Ukraine.\n\nCarlson fired back, clearly referring to Smith but not naming him: \u201cUnlike maybe some dayside hosts, I\u2019m not very partisan.\u201d\n\nA former Fox News staffer who has recently been in touch with Smith said that the spat with Carlson was the last straw and that Smith had grown frustrated in recent months by the repeated attacks on the news division by other opinion hosts. Fox News declined to comment on the reasons for Smith\u2019s resignation.\n\nIn farewell remarks, Smith said, \u201cRecently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News and begin a new chapter. After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small-town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor.\u201d\n\nSmith has often incurred the wrath of some loyal Fox News viewers with his skeptical reporting and commentary on the president, in stark contrast to its prime-time and morning hosts, who often flatter the president. Trump has given frequent interviews to his most loyal Fox News personalities but has never sat for one with Smith.\n\nSmith\u2019s criticism of Trump dates to the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency. After a presidential news conference in early 2017, for example, he called some of Trump\u2019s responses \u201cabsolutely crazy.\u201d He went on to defend rival news network CNN after Trump called its reporting \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cCNN\u2019s reporting was not fake news,\u201d Smith said at the time. \u201cIts journalists follow the same standards to which other news organizations, including Fox News, adhere.\u201d\n\nMore recently, he urged Fox News viewers to read special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, strongly suggesting that it didn\u2019t exonerate the president, as Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr had claimed. \u201cEveryone in America should read\u201d it, he said on the air. \u201cEveryone.\u201d\n\nTrump, in turn, has sometimes disparaged Smith by name on Twitter, viewing him as an apostate at a network he believes should be loyal to him.\n\nWhile complaining about a new Fox News poll showing a majority of Americans favor his impeachment, Trump on Thursday tweeted, \u201c@FoxNews is . . . much different than it used to be in the good old days.\u201d He named Smith as one of the people at Fox News who \u201cdoesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\nIn August, Trump referred to Smith as \u201clow ratings Shep Smith,\u201d calling him \u201chopeless and clueless.\u201d And in a tweet earlier that month, he wrote \u201cWatching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith, the lowest rated show on @FoxNews. Actually, whenever possible, I turn to @OANN,\u201d a small cable-news competitor.\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, Smith\u2019s program dominated its time period, outdrawing competing programs on MSNBC and CNN by 48 percent and 81 percent, respectively, during the third quarter. His program attracted an average of 1.28 million viewers during the period. However, it was often the lowest-rated daytime program in Fox News\u2019s lineup.\n\nSmith\u2019s departure coincided with reports this week that Barr traveled to New York to meet with Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch at Murdoch\u2019s home in New York City. Neither side explained the reason for the meeting.\n\nAsked by reporters on Friday for his reaction to Smith\u2019s resignation, Trump responded with mock sympathy. \u201cIs he leaving?\u201d he said. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a shame. . . . Is he leaving because of terrible ratings? If he\u2019s leaving, I assume he\u2019s leaving for bad ratings. . . . Well, I wish him well.\u201d\n\nIn his final broadcast on Friday, the 55-year-old Smith said he had struck an agreement with Fox News in which \u201cI won\u2019t be reporting elsewhere at least in the near future,\u201d an apparent reference to a \u201cnoncompete\u201d agreement that keeps departing TV news personalities from joining competitors. He did not announce any plans other than spending time with family and friends. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see what comes along,\u201d he said.\n\nChris Giglio, Smith\u2019s personal spokesman, said the decision to leave Fox \u201cwas Shep\u2019s, and his alone.\u201d Giglio said Smith would take some time off but \u201che is not retiring.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s unease at the network goes back much further than this month\u2019s spats, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Smith had grown uncomfortable with the increasingly Trump-friendly tone of the network, and his departure was attributed to an accumulation of that unease combined with increasingly public insults and digs from outspoken opinion hosts, who have not been shy about registering their disdain for their news colleagues.\n\nSmith was one of the most respected figures inside the Fox News newsroom, and some employees said his resignation is a blow to morale. He left the building through the freight elevator and an underground passageway to avoid possible paparazzi outside the building and the emotional interactions he may have had on his way out, according to one of the people with knowledge of his departure.\n\nHe signed off the air on Friday saying: \u201cEven in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day. That the truth will always matter. That journalism and journalists will thrive. I\u2019m Shepard Smith, Fox News, New York.\u201d\n\nHis announcement was clearly a surprise to his newsroom colleagues. Neil Cavuto, who hosts the Fox News show immediately following Smith\u2019s newscast, reacted with a single word when Smith threw the broadcast to him: \u201cWhoa.\u201d\n\nStaff writer David Nakamura contributed to this report.", "description": "The network\u2019s longtime chief news anchor announced the news on his Friday show, which was his last.", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter", "Sarah Ellison", "Reporter Covering Media", "Its Intersection With Politics", "October At Pm", "Paul Farhi Is The Washington Post'S Media Reporter.
