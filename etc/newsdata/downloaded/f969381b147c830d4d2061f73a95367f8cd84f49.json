(supplied )\n\nHe qualified for the world championships after racking up a number of podium finishes, including first place at a 22-kilometre race in Killlington, Vermont, in mid-September.\n\nBrown faced blinding wind and pouring rain as he ran up Killington Peak with a 45-kilogram sandbag on his back. His biggest fear, he said, was slipping in the mud.\n\n\"You couldn't see 20 feet in front of you,\" he said.\n\nBy the end of the three-hour race, however, he had annihilated his opponents, finishing an hour ahead of his closest rival.\n\nAs part of Daniel Brown's training, he flips giant tractor tires at his Ottawa gym. (Jean Delisle/CBC)\n\nHard training\n\nBrown trains several times a week by running in the Gatineau hills, while also working on his conditioning indoors at Ottawa's Obstacle Race Course Academy.\n\n\"You need strong legs to do your heavy carries,\" said Brown. \"You also need to train your forearms and biceps because you're pulling up your body weight.\"\n\nAt the academy, Brown flips a 45-kilogram tire down a track, turns around, and repeats it three more times.\n\nThe tire at the race in Vermont, he said, weighed more than double that.\n\nHe swings one-handed along the elevated hanging rings in a fluid, effortless motion, resembling a monkey swinging from tree to tree.\n\nMorgan McKay, one of Daniel Brown's coaches, says the Ottawa teen's talent and dedication to training has made him into a champion. (Jean Delisle/CBC )\n\n'He's just incredibly strong'\n\nThe sport requires endurance, strength and speed, said Brown's coach Morgan McKay \u2014 and the Ottawa teen excels at all three of those.\n\n\"The thing I'm blown away with ... is his grip strength. He's just incredibly strong. If you watch him on the monkey bars, he's super fast,\" said McKay, who herself competes in obstacle course racing.\n\nShe said she picks up tips from Brown, whom she describes as generous and humble.\n\n\"It's incredible that he is so focused on his goals,\" McKay said, \"He's already at a world championship level and he's just 15. And he's just going to get better and better.\"\n\nBrown hopes international lobbying efforts to get obstacle course racing accepted as an Olympic sport in the future will be successful.\n\nBut that's down the road \u2014 and so is a possible tryout for American Ninja Warrior, he says, since you have to be 19 years old to compete under the bright lights of the reality television show.", "description": "The 15-year-old Stittsville teen is heading off to the world obstacle racing championships this weekend outside London, England.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5316785.1570745656!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/daniel-brown-ottawa-obstacle-course-race.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
