McBride-Charpentier said that the game won\u2019t feature any fictional art or fictional history. Although education isn\u2019t the primary focus, part of the game is about teaching players how museums work, and how placing art and artifacts next to each other can contextualize history and tell a story to visitors.\n\nLike school children all over the world, McBride-Charpentier grew up going to museums on school trips in his native Ottawa, saying, \u201cI was lucky as a kid to be exposed to a lot of different ones.\u201d\n\nThough McBride-Charpentier doesn\u2019t have a lot of standout memories of museums from his childhood, his research for this game has given him the opportunity to visit and learn from prestigious museums in the United States as well as Canada.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to all the big New York ones, and I was really inspired by how they mix a lot of different things together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Met has fine art, and then it\u2019s got medieval armour and then ancient Egypt stuff. What I\u2019ve taken from my more recent museum trips is just how fun it is to see a variety of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cContext is so important,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis [game] is still obviously in development, but the plan is players will be able to create an exhibit that has maybe all paintings from a certain era, or they might take some of those paintings and add them alongside more historical artifacts. So, kind of creating the context for themselves... The goal is to get players seeing these relationships between items from separate collections and how they might combine together.\u201d\n\nMcBride-Charpentier used the example of a collection of space-related objects that he plans to put in Mondo Museum. Players could combine models of the solar system with artifacts from ancient Egypt to show how Egyptians understood astronomy. There will even be a combo system to reward players that combine different objects across history.\n\nMondo Museum will be an idealised version of what museums can be, rather than what they currently are. McBride-Charpentier said that there won\u2019t be security guards in this game, for example, though players will have to manage the wear and tear on exhibits from handsy visitors. McBride-Charpentier also noted that he doesn\u2019t want this game to uphold the often exclusionary system of large museums, including the practice of holding onto artifacts that were stolen from their countries of origin.\n\n\u201cThe way that [museums] have built their collections in the West is mostly based on colonial looting,\u201d McBride-Charpentier said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge black mark on these kinds of institutions. Instead of representing that, this game is showing a more utopian version of what museums should be like.\u201d\n\nMcBride-Charpentier further clarified this vision over email. \u201cThe way new items are unlocked and you grow your collection is by receiving loans from other museums, the home museum where these items rightly belong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor example, more Ancient Egyptian items are unlocked by satisfying the pre-conditions of the director/curator from an Ancient Egyptian museum in Cairo, who appears as a kind of VIP visitor judging that your museum is good enough to display their items.\u201d\n\nThough Mondo Museum is, at its heart, a management sim, since McBride-Charpentier wants to create a game that satisfies management sim diehards such as he, he also hopes that this game will help players see real-life museums in a new light.\n\n\u201cI would love it if people play this and then were inspired to go out to the real museums that might be nearby,\u201d he said.", "description": "According to its creator, upcoming management sim Mondo Museum represents an ideal version of what museums can be....", "authors": ["Nathan Grayson"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/gm3ahravxpvblo2de8ub.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
