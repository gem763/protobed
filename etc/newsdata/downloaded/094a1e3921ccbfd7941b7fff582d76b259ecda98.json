Several reporters and lawmakers noted how the venue could be viewed as a massive conflict of interest. Initially, Mulvaney defended their decision and insisted Trump would not profit from the event.\n\nSome media called that claim \"preposterous,\" noting that \"the free advertising alone would have been a priceless opportunity for the Trump clan.\"\n\nMulvaney stood his ground for a day or two, before bowing to the heaps of pressure. Over the weekend, the administration decided to back off of the location.\n\nOn Twitter on Monday, Trump confirmed that it was the media backlash that derailed their plans.\n\nDoral in Miami would have been the best place to hold the G-7, and free, but too much heat from the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats & their Partner, the Fake News Media! I\u2019m surprised that they allow me to give up my $400,000 Plus Presidential Salary! We\u2019ll find someplace else! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2019\n\nTrump said he was \"surprised\" by the negative response. Yet, when Mulvaney was informing the press last week at the White House, he said that Trump knew he'd get some heat for the announcement. The president regretted the turn of events because Doral had \"tremendous ballrooms and meeting rooms\" that would have been a perfect place to host international leaders.\n\nThe White House is searching for a new venue, one of which, Trump said, could be Camp David.\n\nThe 2020 G7 summit will be held in mid-June.", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:24:06AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/290/95726a8d-d767-4671-a467-dbf711964539.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
