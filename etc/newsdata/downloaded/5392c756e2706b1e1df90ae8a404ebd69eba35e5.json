Quarter-finals can be incredibly difficult and if you have a bad day at the office you will be in trouble. That's what happened to Wales last week but, because they have forgotten how to lose, they somehow dug themselves out of a mighty hole.\n\nThe injection of energy and motivation a side experiences when they escape from what seems certain defeat can be incredible. That extra life you get galvanises you, a feeling that everything now is a bonus \u2014 that's what I expect from Wales on Sunday.\n\nWales have Warren Gatland who is one of the best ever Test coaches - he never misses a trick\n\nFollowing England's incredible win over New Zealand on Saturday, we have the opportunity of seeing a World Cup final between England and Wales.\n\nJust knowing that is potentially only 80 minutes away will surely excite Wales even more. Liam Williams is a big loss but Leigh Halfpenny isn't the worst replacement and what a boost to have Jonathan Davies and Ross Moriarty back.\n\nAnd Wales have Warren Gatland who is one of the best ever Test coaches. He never misses a trick and is a man on a mission. He steps down after this World Cup and will want to go out in style.\n\nGatland has won three Grand Slams and done great things with the Lions but he has his heart set on getting Wales to a World Cup final. Wales to nick it.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: Many wrote off Wales's World Cup chances after their narrow victory over France last week.
