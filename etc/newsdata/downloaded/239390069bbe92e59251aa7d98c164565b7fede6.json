Netanyahu has promised, if reelected, to upend the longtime status quo in the occupied territories by annexing large portions of the West Bank, an initiative that would be popular with right-wing voters but could incur Arab outrage. When he announced these grand designs, he cited the approval of the Trump administration, slated to release its new Middle East peace plan after the Israeli election.\n\n[Netanyahu offers West Bank annexation to right-wing voters ahead of election]\n\nAnd personally for Netanyahu, who this summer became Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, the election could determine whether he faces prosecution in three criminal cases involving allegations of fraud, bribery and breach of trust. Reports suggest that he is counting on securing a governing coalition so he might pass legislation to help him avoid prosecution.\n\nLiberman, born in Moldova, has long been the voice of many Israelis who migrated from Russia and other former Soviet republics. Right-wing on national security but fiercely secular, he has made inroads with the wider population, especially after scuttling Netanyahu\u2019s coalition efforts in May by refusing to join a government with ultra-Orthodox Jewish and other religiously oriented parties.\n\n\u201cI will not sit in a government with the ultra-Orthodox or the fanatics,\u201d Liberman recently promised a crowd of about 100 affluent and influential native Israelis who turned out at an expansive villa north of Tel Aviv to hear his campaign pitch.\n\nAs he spoke, the lights glimmered off the swimming pool and a sumptuous buffet beckoned guests dressed in finery. The glamorous setting in Rishpon, one of Israel\u2019s most exclusive communities, made for an unusual campaign event for an unlikely political power broker.\n\nIn heavily Russian-accented Hebrew, Liberman, a former nightclub bouncer, cautioned there were only two possible outcomes to the election. In one, he warned, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party wins big, enabling the prime minister to form a new right-wing coalition controlled by the ultra-Orthodox and other religious factions. In the other scenario, Liberman\u2019s party wins enough votes that he can demand that Israel\u2019s largely secular mainstream parties join forces.\n\n\n\nA campaign billboard shows Avigdor Liberman, then Israel\u2019s foreign minister, in Acre, Israel, in 2015.

With the ruling Likud party and its chief rival, the Blue and White party, running neck-and-neck and both certain to fall well short of the 61 seats required to win an outright majority, Liberman could be the kingmaker.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the prospects are high for a government with Liberman determining who the other partners will be,\u201d said Dan Avnon, political science chairman at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nLiberman\u2019s mounting influence has the other candidates concerned, particularly Netanyahu. Over the past few months, the prime minister has made a noticeable effort to siphon support from Liberman\u2019s traditional base, holding rallies for Russian-speaking immigrants, posting billboards of himself with a beaming Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and even visiting Ukraine last month. On Thursday, Netanyahu met Putin in Sochi, Russia, saying the trip was for important security talks \u201cin the face of the attempts by Iran and its proxies to attack us.\u201d\n\nMore than 1 million Russian-speakers with Jewish heritage moved to Israel after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Recent government statistics show there are about 1.5 million Russian-speakers in Israel, some 17.25 percent of the total population.\n\nIn the past, they largely voted for Liberman\u2019s Yisrael Beiteinu party, established 20 years ago, because of its focus on immigrant issues.\n\nBut today, particularly among the second generation or those who came as children, the voting pattern more often mirrors that of mainstream Israeli society. Liberman also saw his support erode for a time as he faced corruption charges \u2014 he was later acquitted \u2014 and gained a reputation in some quarters as a political opportunist.\n\nHis more vocal conflict recently with the ultra-Orthodox, however, has revived his standing and extended it beyond his former support base.\n\n\u201cI will vote for Liberman this time. I still trust him,\u201d said Irena Braginsky, 70, who arrived in Israel from Ukraine nearly 30 years ago. She said that Netanyahu had done little to help people like her over the years, giving in to the ultra-Orthodox on issues such as shuttering stores and public transportation on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath.\n\n\u201cMe and my husband have no car and there are no buses on Shabbat, so we are stuck here in the city every weekend,\u201d she said as she sat with a group of friends in the center of Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb with myriad Russian supermarkets, bookstores and signs. \u201cEverything is closed. You can\u2019t buy anything. And all that happened because Netanyahu does whatever the religious parties tell him to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn ultra-Orthodox Jewish man prepares to vote during Israel's parliamentary elections on April 9 in Jerusalem.

Meanwhile, the ultra-Orthodox pray all day long and live off my taxes. . . . I want our country to be modern and secular.\u201d He said a vote for Netanyahu was essentially a vote for his ultra-Orthodox allies.\n\nBack at the villa in Rishpon, Liberman was looking to take advantage of those same frustrations. He talked about the economy, the Palestinians and the wider Arab world but always returned to the influence of Israel\u2019s religious groups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against Haredim,\u201d he said, using the Hebrew term to describe the ultra-Orthodox. \u201cMy family is mixed religious and secular. My wife is Orthodox. My daughter is Orthodox. On Friday night we make kiddush, but on Saturday morning, if there is no election, I go play tennis.\u201d\n\nThen, in his signature deadpan voice, Liberman added: \u201cIn my house, I only eat kosher. Outside, I only eat what tastes good.\u201d\n\nHis quip drew laughs from the crowd, before he resumed skewering the ultra-Orthodox, who represent 10 percent of Israel\u2019s population, for failing to contribute to the economy by choosing religious studies over employment and for seeking to infringe on secular freedoms, for instance, by seeking to close mini-markets on Saturdays.\n\n\u201cI am not against the Haredim,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just against them trying to control my life.\u201d\n\nOne of the guests, who provided only her first name, Hadassah, said she would give Liberman a chance this time.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best person to oppose Netanyahu,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s promised to force all the sides into a broad, secular coalition, and that is what Israel needs.\u201d\n\nMcAuley reported from Bat Yam.
