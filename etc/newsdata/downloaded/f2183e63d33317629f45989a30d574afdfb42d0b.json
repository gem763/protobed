It is not the same thing as being friendly to the Russian point of view. Nor is it akin to being compromised by knowing the Russians have damaging material\u2014as so many have speculated is the case with President Donald Trump. Think of being a Russian asset as something in between cluelessness and conspiracy. But without further evidence, all Clinton managed to do was to prepare the ground for Gabbard to dismiss all future accusations or revelations as just more grandstanding from a defeated and bitter 2016 nominee.\n\nClinton\u2019s defenders claim that it was good to expose Gabbard and to prevent a third-party run. This is wishful thinking. Hillary Clinton is not the arbiter of Democratic Party politics. And a third-party challenge isn\u2019t the only way to damage the eventual Democratic nominee\u2026\n\nThis is where Gabbard\u2019s efforts, Trump\u2019s strategy, and Russian hopes will coincide. The goal will not be to turn Democratic voters into Gabbard voters or Trump voters. It will be to confuse them, dispirit them, and alienate them from their own party\u2014and then convince them to stay home. This will strike at the Democratic Party\u2019s two most exposed weaknesses: turnout, and the inefficient distribution of Democratic voters in the Electoral College. If Gabbard can convince enough voters that \u201cRussia\u201d is just something that cranky losers chant whenever things don\u2019t go their way, she can strike directly at these weaknesses and do material damage to the nominee.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tom Nichols", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Hillary-Clinton-Elevating-Tulsi-Gabbard"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
