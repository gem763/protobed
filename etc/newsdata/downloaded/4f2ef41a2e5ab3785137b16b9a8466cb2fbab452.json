Their heirs are fascinated by a rather different model of social organization: the junior-high cafeteria.\n\n\u201cNobody should be friends with George W. Bush\u201d reads the headline over Sarah Jones\u2019s essay in New York magazine, that purported bastion of urbanity. The article addresses the scandalization of American progressives by the private life of talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, whose circle of friends is wide enough to encompass many people with whom she disagrees politically, including the former president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is much to criticize in Jones\u2019s piece\u2014the insipid prose, the intellectually dishonest mischaracterization of the casus belli in Iraq\u2014but what is most relevant here is Jones\u2019s thinking about second-best outcomes. She writes: \u201cIn a superior reality\u201d\u2014she means \u201ca better world\u201d\u2014\u201cthe Hague\u201d\u2014the U.N. court seated there\u2014\u201cwould be sorting out whether he is guilty of war crimes. Since our international institutions have failed to punish, or even censure him, surely the only moral response from civil society should [sic] be to shun him. But here is Ellen DeGeneres hanging out with him at a Cowboys game.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s quite a spread: Ideally, Bush would be strung up by the heels, but, short of that, at least he should be snubbed by that nice lady who dances merrily on television while wearing the better part of $1 million on her wrist. (DeGeneres is a serious wristwatch fiend, and anybody with that many Rolexes is at least a little bit Republican.) DeGeneres\u2019s offense, in Jones\u2019s telling, is engaging in \u201cthe grossest form of class solidarity.\u201d This seems to be a sensitive point for Jones, who notes a tweet from Chris Cillizza, and then writes: \u201cThere\u2019s almost no point to rebutting anything that Chris Cillizza writes. Whatever he says is inevitably dumb and wrong, and then I get angry while I think about how much money he gets to be dumb and wrong on a professional basis.\u201d I assume the money is pretty good at CNN, where Cillizza works, but I have never been under the impression that New York is a salt mine. Sarah Jones should be grateful for the opportunity to be dumb and wrong on a professional basis there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones is fairly typical in indicting Bush for his purported failure on the question of \u201cbasic human rights for LGBT people\u201d without addressing the question of whether we should also shun, say, Barack Obama, who ran as a presidential candidate opposed to gay marriage. Nor does she consider that maybe Ellen DeGeneres doesn\u2019t need lessons on how to lesbian from New York magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones makes a sophomoric effort to dress the question up, but this is the eternal politics of cooties. Say that headline out loud\u2014\u201cNobody should be friends with George W. Bush\u201d\u2014and you can practically hear Cher Horowitz chiming in that his cowboy boots are \u201cso five minutes ago.\u201d\n\nThe urban sophisticates at New York are not the only practitioners of the politics of cooties. When the news got out that Mark Zuckerberg has been having occasional conversations with conservative writers and thinkers (including me), the usual little pissant brigade of Caitlyns on Twitter lost it: #DeleteFacebook even trended for a minute. The Caitlyn-in-Chief, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was livid, demanding to know what was discussed during the Facebook founder\u2019s \u201congoing dinner parties with far-right figures.\u201d If she had asked him which table he sat at during lunch in eighth grade, she couldn\u2019t have been any less serious. Congressional Republicans may be as useless as teats on a boar hog, but they should thank whatever higher power they believe in for such opposition as that.\n\nApril Glaser, writing in Slate, insisted that it should \u201cregister as shocking\u201d that Zuckerberg met with Tucker Carlson. She never makes an argument for why that should be shocking; she assumes that it is self-evident. Cooties. Everywhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis comes from the Right, too. Every now and then I\u2019ll have an article in the Washington Post or appear on MSNBC, and I\u2019ll get 11,000 emails and rage-monkey tweets demanding: \u201cWhy would you want to work with those people? Huh? They aren\u2019t your friends!\u201d I don\u2019t know, Bubba, because a lot of people read the Washington Post who don\u2019t read National Review, and they ain\u2019t ever going to hear it if we don\u2019t bring it to them? And maybe the folks at the Washington Post aren\u2019t my people, but then neither is y\u2019all, Bubba.\n\nBut we\u2019re all in this together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(For our sins, Bubba.)\n\n\u201cWe are not enemies, but friends,\u201d Abraham Lincoln said in his first inaugural address. It would be more difficult to say a few years later, when Americans had become one another\u2019s enemies on the battlefields of the Civil War. We throw around the word \u201ctreason\u201d irresponsibly in our time. But when Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia were forced to surrender at Appomattox Court House, they had been engaged in genuine treason\u2014\u201ctreason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them\u201d\u2014on a massive scale. But Lincoln\u2019s better angels carried the day. Lee and his men were given the most generous terms imaginable. Ulysses. S. Grant, saddened and embarrassed by the occasion, spent the first part of the meeting reminiscing with Lee about their service together in the Mexican War. The rebels were not even humiliated, when justice would have countenanced hanging them. And then in one of this nation\u2019s great moments of republican virtue, Grant had his men salute Lee and his ragged, defeated rebels as they turned to ride home, in safety and with dignity.\n\nAbraham Lincoln did not have the likes of Sarah Jones around to advise him.
