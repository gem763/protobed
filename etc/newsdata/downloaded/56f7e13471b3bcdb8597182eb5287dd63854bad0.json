CNN, MSNBC climate forums promise serious talk, but no guarantee of sustained coverage.\n\nAndrew Yang will get roughly 40 minutes on CNN Wednesday evening to make his pitch about how he would confront the threat of climate change as president.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t mean he wholeheartedly supports the seven-hour marathon town hall.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt would probably be better for @cnn to report on Hurricane Dorian and the actual effects of climate change rather than having us talk about climate change,\u201d Yang tweeted Tuesday.\n\nYang\u2019s complaint goes to the heart of the media\u2019s ongoing struggles to cover the causes and effects of global warming: While the major TV networks and online outlets are committed to giving it serious-issue treatment, like abortion rights or gun violence, they have been far less comfortable relating the scientific consensus in favor of man-made climate change to in-the-moment coverage of devastating weather-related events.\n\nThis month, in advance of the United Nations Climate Action Summit, the nation\u2019s news media is preparing multiple special projects and broadcasts devoted to the issue. In addition to CNN\u2019s seven-hour conclave, MSNBC is sponsoring a two-day forum on Sept. 19 and 20 and more than 220 news outlets have pledged to provide a week of climate-focused coverage leading up to the Sept. 23 summit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the level of interest be this high,\u201d said MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who will co-moderate the MSNBC event that\u2019s also sponsored by Georgetown's Institute of Politics and Public Service, Our Daily Planet, and New York magazine.\n\nWhile many climate-change activists and experts are pleased with the special commitment of time and energy, they are also skeptical about whether the leading outlets will keep the pressure on political leaders throughout the election and amid coverage of events like Hurricane Dorian.\n\nDavid Wallace-Wells, a New York magazine deputy editor and author of \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming,\u201d expressed frustration with the networks' framing of climate change during the first two Democratic presidential debates. The moderators\u2019 focus, he said, was \u201con matters of cost and budgeting, rather than getting the candidates to make their case as to why they have to take action now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s a danger where we skip over the case for climate action and then start debating how difficult it will be to manage,\u201d he added.\n\nWallace-Wells said it is \u201creally valuable\u201d to get the candidates to speak at length on television as its been \u201ca shame and a tragedy\u201d the climate conversation has been neglected. Still, he\u2019s skeptical of a format in which even journalists like himself, who are deeply immersed in the issue, are unlikely to tune in for seven hours.\n\nThe anticipated low ratings could do more to depress future coverage of global warming than stimulate an ongoing discussion. \"As a sort of test case of TV spectacle, I imagine the numbers will be abysmally bad,\u201d Wallace-Wells said.\n\nCNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist acknowledged that \u201cevery viewer is not going to watch every candidate and every minute.\u201d While CNN producers will undoubtedly look at the numbers, Feist said that ratings aren\u2019t the motivation behind the event. \u201cThis is an important subject that we think deserves the time,\u201d he said.\n\nFor its part, CNN, which has steadily covered Dorian, is sticking to its schedule despite Yang\u2019s complaint, though the network seems likely to address the devastating storm during Wednesday\u2019s \u201cClimate Crisis\u201d broadcast given that scientists see warmer oceans and rising sea levels as intensifying hurricanes.\n\n\u201cWhat better time to talk about climate change than when you have a story that involves, in many ways, climate change,\u201d Feist said.\n\nThe news media came under fire for downplaying climate change in the 2016 election, with moderators failing to put a single question about it to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during the three presidential debates. That won\u2019t be the case Wednesday as 10 Democratic contenders field questions on the subject from CNN anchors and audience members in back-to-back town halls, stretching from 5 p.m to midnight.\n\nA couple weeks later, MSNBC gets its shot at the Democratic field. Hayes, a progressive MSNBC host who has focused more on climate change than most in TV news, acknowledged last year that the topic can be a \"palpable ratings killer.\" Hayes said he believes \u201cpeople are paying attention more.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a confluence of factors, he said, including the global student strike movement, Trump\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d on climate change, and \u201cthe actual effects before our eyes, day in and day out.\u201d He said it\u2019s \u201cpretty tough to look at\u201d raging fires in Siberia and the Amazon, or ice rapidly melting ice in Greenland, and not think \u201cwoah.\u201d\n\nDemocratic primary voters consistently cite climate change as one of the biggest issues in the 2020 election, though activists were frustrated by the party\u2019s unwillingness to sanction a climate-only debate. The Democratic National Committee last week rejected such a proposal, a move that drew rebukes from several candidates. \"Our planet is burning \u2014 the least we can do as a party is debate what to do about it,\u201d tweeted former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nWhile candidates cannot participate in unsanctioned debates, they may attend TV town halls in which they appear separately on stage. CNN invited the 10 Democratic candidates who met the polling and fundraising thresholds for next week\u2019s ABC/Univision debate, while MSNBC invited all declared 2020 candidates. So far, 11 Democrats and one long-shot Republican, Bill Weld, have agreed to participate in the two-day gathering, which will be streamed live on NBC News Now and featured on shows hosted by Hayes and co-moderator Ali Velshi.\n\nSunrise Movement, the youth-led climate group that advocated unsuccessfully for a Democratic climate debate, said the CNN and MSNBC events offer \u201ca historic opportunity to put the national spotlight on the climate crisis.\u201d However, communications director Stephen O'Hanlon said in a statement that \u201cthe candidates and the moderators must connect the dots between the climate crisis and extreme weather like Dorian.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 unveiled ambitious climate plans ahead of CNN\u2019s event. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign blasted out emails Wednesday touting his plan and how it departs from the pack.\n\nBeyond specific policies, Klein said she is also looking for which candidate \u201cis going to be able to tell the most captivating story about the next economy that we have to build\u201d and demonstrate the link between climate and a range of issues, from transit to unemployment to national security.\n\nThe appearance of 10 Democrats on stage throughout Wednesday evening in support of action on climate change, albeit with different plans, should present a stark contrast to President Trump, who had denied the science behind global warming and whose administration has scaled back environmental regulations. The event has prompted some criticism on the right, such as the conservative Media Research Center accusing the network of \u201cclimate change indoctrination.\u201d\n\nFeist said CNN\u2019s position is that there is a \u201cclimate crisis,\u201d as the event is billed. He stressed that the network isn\u2019t advocating for any solution, but giving presidential candidates the opportunity to present their plans before a national, and global, audience.\n\nThe climate story, of course, is a global one, and one project launching this month, Covering Climate Now, is aiming at a worldwide audience. Mark Hertsgaard, a coordinator of the project and environment correspondent at The Nation magazine, told POLITICO the collective efforts of news organizations involved could reach a half-billion people.\n\nMore than 220 news outlets, along with independent organizations and journalists, have have signed on to run climate-focused coverage ahead of the U.N. summit, including The Guardian, Bloomberg, CBS News, The Times of India, Japan\u2019s Asahi Shimbun, and Spain\u2019s El Pais. The project includes news sites like BuzzFeed News, HuffPost and The Daily Beast, as well as traditional newspapers such as The Minneapolis Star Tribune, The Oklahoman, and The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nHertsgaard said the project began in the wake of the landmark U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last October in which scientists warned that the world had 12 years to reduce emissions in hopes of averting a climate catastrophe. He teamed up with Columbia Journalism Review Editor-in-Chief Kyle Pope on an April event and in the ongoing project.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of journalists and news outlets who are doing more climate coverage or want to do more climate coverage,\u201d Hertsgaard said. \u201cWhat we want to do with this initiative is to highlight that critical mass.\u201d\n\nHertsgaard said some news organizations may be reluctant to participate due to concerns that joining \u201ca journalistic collaboration like this is somehow advocacy, is somehow partisanship.\u201d Hertsgaard said the project isn\u2019t partisan, but motivated by \u201calarming\u201d scientific facts.\n\n\"The science makes it clear that this is a crisis situation,\" he said, \"and therefore it is our job as journalists to make clear those facts to the public.\"\n\n", "description": "CNN, MSNBC climate forums promise serious talk, but no guarantee of sustained coverage.", "authors": ["Michael Calderone"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f3/18/6f203e774dfea9fc133d0b2bdb8a/190904-cnn-getty-773.jpg"}
