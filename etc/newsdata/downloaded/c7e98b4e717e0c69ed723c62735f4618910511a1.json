The coroner\u2019s office took possession of them.\n\nNo evidence indicates that medical procedures were performed at Klopfer\u2019s home, and his family is cooperating with the investigation, the sheriff\u2019s office said. No other information was immediately available.\n\nKlopfer is considered Indiana\u2019s \u201cmost prolific\u201d abortion doctor, with tens of thousands of procedures performed, the South Bend Tribune reported. The state suspended his medical license in 2016 for failing to exercise reasonable care and for violating notice and documentation requirements, the Tribune reported. The Women\u2019s Pavilion shut down the same year.\n\nSome Democrats are angry that abortion, women\u2019s rights were ignored at debate\n\nIn Indiana, fetal remains must be buried or cremated. Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) said in a statement that she would consider proposing federal legislation related to the disposal of aborted fetus\u2019 remains. Walorski also called on state and federal authorities to conduct a full investigation into Klopfer.\n\nJeanne Mancini, president of the antiabortion March for Life, said the fetal remains allegedly at Klopfer\u2019s home are a reminder that it is \u201coutrageous\u201d that abortion activists and many politicians advocate for fewer regulations on the procedure.\n\n\u201cWe urge a thorough investigation of this case so that justice may be done, and so that the public becomes aware of what really happens inside America\u2019s abortion industry,\u201d Mancini said in a statement.\n\nThe macabre discovery of fetal remains contains echoes of the case of Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia doctor who is serving a life sentence after a jury in 2013 convicted him of murder for snipping the spinal cords of three babies who lived for a few moments outside the womb. Investigators found dismembered remains in milk jugs and glass jars inside Gosnell\u2019s clinic.\n\nThe remains allegedly found at Klopfer\u2019s home also resonate because of his clinic\u2019s location in South Bend, whose mayor is 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg. Antiabortion circles buzzed this month about Buttigieg\u2019s remark on the radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d that the Bible says \u201clife begins with breath.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nDemocrats\u2019 leftward shift on third-trimester abortion\n\nWhy the N.Y.
