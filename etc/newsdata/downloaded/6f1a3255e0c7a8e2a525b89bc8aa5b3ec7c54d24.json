When I haven\u2019t washed my hair in three or four days (putting off washing for as long as you can is recommended if you have bleached or damaged hair like I do), it can start to feel a little gross. My trick is to apply some Mother\u2019s Own dry shampoo, followed by a spritz of hair perfume (I use Sachajuan\u2019s); it instantly makes my hair feel clean, revitalized, and luxurious. I recently complimented a friend of mine on their scent (which was kind of rosy and cedarwood-y), and she told me it was this Ouai stuff. She also told me the perfume was capable of canceling out even the worst, most persistent smells (including cigarette smoke from a night out) completely.
