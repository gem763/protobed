Which is convenient, really, as ours has been prorogued, again (or rather, technically, for the first time).\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Michel Barnier stands up and patiently explains why there isn\u2019t going to be a Brexit deal next week, when over here we have to find out via deranged anonymous briefings from No 10, sent out in the form of a 795-word text message to a single journalist.\n\nIt\u2019s that, well, we are perhaps at the point of having to accept that a solution to the Irish border question isn\u2019t going to be found. If there were a technological answer, it would already be in existence on the Norway-Sweden border. It\u2019s not. There isn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis and other reasons are why Angela Merkel may or may not have said there will be no deal \u201cever\u201d unless Northern Ireland stays in the customs union (we don\u2019t know if she said it because we only have No 10\u2019s anonymous, unverified word on it, and if No 10 told you it was Wednesday, you\u2019d check).\n\nBut if there is not to be a deal, it means the EU Parliament has been having, for some time, the debate Britain should have been having, and will doubtless be having soon.\n\nIn the EU Parliament, the Conservative and Labour \u2013 and, it would seem, almost all other parties from all over Europe \u2013 do not get a word in.\n\nThe Lib Dems and the Brexit Party just scream at each other all day. The Brexit Party want a no-deal Brexit. The Lib Dems want to Remain. And they, as Tony Blair said not so long ago, and he is never wrong (alright, he was wrong once), are the only two credible options available.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Lib Dem MPs rose, in turn, to call Boris Johnson a charlatan, to demand a lengthy Article 50 extension, which will be used to revoke Article 50 itself then have a referendum, and the \u201cclear majority\u201d of British people will vote to remain.\n\nNigel Farage stood up, in turn, to shout at all of them. \u201cYou are a stuck up snob,\u201d he bellowed at one of them. \u201cWho are you to say the people didn\u2019t know what they were voting for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will never accept a German chancellor attempting to annex a part of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not have it.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s just Brits bellowing at Brits, one lot demanding no-deal Brexit, the other demanding Remain.\n\nYou won\u2019t find anyone here doing a Labour Party. Which is to say (deep breath) a general election with a manifesto commitment to a second referendum followed by a special one day conference to decide the party\u2019s position which the government then won\u2019t be forced to actually back.\n\nThere is no dreadful triangulation. There is no one doing a Matt Hancock, or a Nicky Morgan, living out the life of a tortured, lobotomised zombie footsoldier from a war-horror movie, just slowly and strangely going along with mad things they absolutely know to be wrong.\n\nNone of the creeping evasion and untruth that has eaten its way through the two main parties like a cancer over three long years.\n\nWhether it is the answer that Britain needs is difficult to say. But if there is to be a second referendum, Brussels is currently serving up canapes of what to expect. \u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace.\u201d \u201cNo you\u2019re a disgrace.\u201d \u201cLeave!\u201d \u201cRemain!\u201d\n\nIt is almost refreshing to watch. Abysmal, obviously, but honest.", "description": "If you want to see the very near future of British politics, the European Parliament is the place to go.
