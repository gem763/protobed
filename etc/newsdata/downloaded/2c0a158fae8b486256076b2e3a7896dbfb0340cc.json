After scoring just six runs in two listless losses to the Mariners, Galvis helped the Reds salvage a rare win in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\u201cAfter the grand slam, we had some pretty good at-bats and we had a few homers to help us finish scoring later,\u201d Galvis said. \u201cSometimes a team needs a little lift and today that helped us get the momentum and score some runs.\u201d\n\nGalvis\u2019 second slam of the season and third of his career capped a five-run rally in the seventh inning for a 7-5 lead. The Reds rolled into the eighth and picked up two-run homers from Curt Casali and Eugenio Suarez to wipe away yet another monster home run by Mariners rookie Kyle Lewis.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to get a couple innings like that,\u201d Reds manager David Bell said. \u201cA big hit by Freddy. He looked really good at the plate tonight. That\u2019s big. We\u2019ve been struggling to get runs. That\u2019s what it takes usually, a big hit by somebody, and then it kind of opened up after that. We needed it.\u201d\n\nThe win was the first in Seattle since 2007 and snapped a six-game losing streak to the Mariners.\n\nLewis hit a solo shot off the scoreboard in left field in the fifth, pushing the Mariners to a 5-2 lead and becoming just the second player in major league history to homer in each of his first three games.\n\nLewis joined Trevor Story as the only players to accomplish the feat. Story connected in his first four games - totaling six homers in that span - for Colorado in 2016.\n\nThe 24-year-old Lewis, a 6-foot-4 right fielder picked 11th overall in the 2016 draft, also doubled and singled.\n\nCalled up Tuesday from Double-A Arkansas, Lewis homered in the fifth inning for Seattle\u2019s first hit against the Reds\u2018 Trevor Bauer. On Wednesday, he homered in the seventh to end Sonny Gray\u2019s no-hit bid.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose it\u2019s a little different, but still cool,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nSeattle tied a team record by starting seven rookies. Dylan Moore connected for his ninth home run since making his debut this year and shortstop Donnie Walton picked up his first career hit.\n\nNot all the Mariners rookies had as much success, though.\n\nHighly regarded prospect Justin Dunn started for Seattle and walked five before getting pulled with two outs in the first inning. He gave up sacrifice flies to Aristides Aquino and Phillip Ervin and threw 37 pitches, 23 for balls.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lessons you\u2019re going to learn, and I think he learned a very valuable one tonight: the value of slowing it down,\u201d Mariners manager Scott Servais said.\n\nMoore\u2019s homer tied it at 2 in the second and Omar Narvaez added his career-high 20th home run for a 4-2 lead in the third.\n\nGalvis\u2019 slam came off Dan Altavilla (1-1). Sal Romano (1-0) struck out three in 1 1/3 innings. The Reds bullpen gave up just one run in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nSuarez is two home runs behind major league leader Pete Alonso, the New York Mets rookie.\n\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Galvis, the first short stop to hit grand slams for two teams. \u201cHe can play third like a Gold Glove third baseman. And the good thing is he can hit for power everywhere on the field. He\u2019s a special player and I think he\u2019s going to be doing that for a lot of years.\u201d\n\nROSTER RECORDS\n\nWith the appearance of Dunn and fellow rookie pitcher Art Warren, the Mariners extended their major league record to 67 players used this season and set a new standard with 42 pitchers taking the mound. The previous record of 40 pitchers was shared by the 2017 Mariners and the 2014 Texas Rangers.\n\nCLEMENTE AWARD\n\nSecond baseman Dee Gordon of the Seattle Mariners and Cincinnati Reds two-way player Michael Lorenzen have been nominated by their teams for the Roberto Clemente Award. They\u2019ll be recognized Sept. 18 on major league baseball\u2019s 18th annual Roberto Clemente Day.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nReds: It\u2019s highly unlikely CF Nick Senzel will play again this season, general manager Dick Williams said. An MRI shows Senzel has tears in the labrum of his right shoulder. Senzel will meet with doctors to determine the extent of the injury.\n\nWilliams said Senzel might not require surgery, and that even if he does, he would likely be ready for spring training.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot the last two years, I thought it was behind me and to hear about this, it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Senzel said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to derail me. I\u2019m just going to take the right course of action. I\u2019ll decide that after we sit down and talk.\u201d\n\nMariners: OF/DH Domingo Santana (right elbow strain) could see the field this weekend or early next week, manager Scott Servais said. Santana began throwing lightly on the Mariners\u2018 last road trip. Servais said he\u2019ll be available as a pinch-hitter or DH at first and could return to his right field position during the final homestand of the season. . Reliever Matt Magill was available again Thursday after missing several days with a sore back.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds: RHP Luis Castillo (14-6, 3.21 ERA) takes the mound in the series opener at Arizona. He\u2019s 17-7 in his last 34 appearances.\n\nMariners: LHP Yusei Kikuchi (6-9, 5.24 ERA) will open the home series against the Chicago White Sox. He\u2019s allowed one run and seven hits in his last two appearances, striking out 13 over 14 innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One good swing by Freddy Galvis turned things around for the Cincinnati Reds.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Chris Talbott"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/reds_mariners_baseball_02789_c0-158-3766-2353_s1770x1032.jpg?d1cae80a1f6bb79010a6d866b61e737712ae4888", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
