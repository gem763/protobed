For the broker and a number of major fund managers it\u2019s actually a blessing.\n\nThis month\u2019s retreat in fixed income has fueled concerns about the possible risk to the equity bull run. Yet, so far, the stock market has defied the doomsayers, and the reason behind the jump in yields -- improved economic optimism -- has reassured the likes of Eaton Vance Management and Fidelity International that the rally can continue.\n\nThe flight from havens and crowded bond proxies has triggered a switch into equity sectors that are more sensitive to the economy. The broadening of the gains to include value and cyclical stocks will support the rally, said JPMorgan in a note to clients. In the past decade equities rose every time bond yields spiked by at least 50 basis points, climbing by 6% on average, it said.\n\nThe cause for the shift in sentiment is key to understanding the equity market\u2019s nonchalant attitude toward the bond market sell-off. The rise in yields happened amid optimism that the U.S.-China trade talks will continue, which is a positive signal for economic growth and as a consequence, for stocks.\n\n\u201cGovernment bond yields offer less of a signal for equity investors than they have in the past,\u201d said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance Management. \u201cIf bond yields are rising due to optimism about the economy, that should be good for equities, especially since a lot of recession fears had recently been priced into the equity market.\"\n\nIf the yields continue to climb rapidly or the economic picture becomes overly rosy, fueling speculation about a halt to central bank rate cuts, things could \u201cget scary\u201d for stocks, according to Legal & General\u2019s John Roe. But this appears unlikely, he said.\n\nModest investor positioning in stocks also supports the bulls. Despite the MSCI World Index posting a 17% return in 2019, investors have pulled $198 billion from global stocks, while $342 billion surged into bonds as traders sought havens amid trade-war-related concerns.\n\n\u201cBond yields have moved too far year-to-date as we are not expecting a recession,\u201d said Nick Peters, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Fidelity International, which oversees about $413 billion and favors equities. \u201cAs a result, we could see a sell-off in bonds without equities being impacted in the short term.\u201d\n\nStocks are traditionally sensitive to sharp moves in debt, with the latest example occurring last month, when the inversion of the yield curve fueled a retreat from riskier assets. But the correlation between bonds and equities remains \u201cresolutely\u201d negative and higher yields shouldn\u2019t pose a problem to stocks, according to JPMorgan.\n\n\u201cHigher yields usually go hand in hand with improving inflation and growth outlook,\u201d said JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka. \u201cThis is usually a good combination for equities.\u201d\n\nThis creates an environment for an equity rotation away from more defensive bond proxies and in favor of more volatile shares that are sensitive to economic growth. Financial and energy sectors have roared ahead in September, leaving the likes of real estate, healthcare and utilities behind.\n\nEaton Vance, Wells Capital Management and GW&K Investment Management are among the funds that have picked up cyclical and value stocks this month. Just like bonds, growth and momentum stocks had gotten \u201ctoo expensive\u201d and this is a \u201chealthy correction,\u201d said Dan Miller, a director of equities at the $40-billion GW&K.\n\n\u201cIf we do see growth expectations improve a little and inflation expectations firm a little, that could lead to an environment where yields rise and equity markets still tread water or help us touch new highs,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, a multi-asset strategist at Wells Capital Management.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ksenia Galouchko in London at kgalouchko1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Blaise Robinson at brobinson58@bloomberg.net, Jon Menon, John Viljoen\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Many of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s clients are worried that the rise in bond yields threatens the stock market rally.
