They believe the eventual Democratic nominee will have moved too far to the left to win in a general election and that the economy will carry Trump to a second term in office.\n\nAnd not everyone views Warren as a strong general election candidate.\n\n\u201cPlease let the nominee be Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Eric Beach, the founder and co-chairman of Great America PAC, one of the largest outside groups supporting Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nBeach said Warren is an unpalatable option for independents and \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans seeking an alternative to the president.\n\nHe believes the controversy around Warren\u2019s past claims of Native American heritage is more damaging than people realize and will play into Trump\u2019s argument that coastal elites \u2014 Warren is a former Harvard professor \u2014 are hypocrites and opportunists.\n\nWarren initially released the results of a DNA test she said backed up her Native American ancestry claims, but later apologized after tribal leaders said such a test was inappropriate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been holding back on attacking her in hopes that she\u2019s the nominee, so I\u2019m pleased to see that she\u2019s gaining steam,\u201d Beach said. \u201cWe\u2019d be more than happy to face her. She\u2019s spent her life gaming the very system that she is now railing against and we will have ads that drive that point home on every front.\u201d\n\nBarry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, predicted Democrats will lose the center if they nominate a left-leaning candidate like Warren.\n\n\u201cSome of these issues, like reparations for gay people, these are mind numbing things for voters in Youngstown, Ohio,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cIt might win her the primary, but it also makes her the easiest candidate to defeat in the general election.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd one administration official told The Hill that the best match-up Trump could hope for is against a policy wonk such as Warren.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what he does against the cerebral, policy-focused candidates,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe\u2019d blow her out of the water.\u201d\n\nStill, several in Trump\u2019s orbit said they\u2019re worried about the prospect of going up against a \u201cmovement\u201d candidate and an unknown quantity on the national stage, saying that they at least know how to attack Biden and what to expect from him.\n\n\u201cWith a movement candidate like Warren, you\u2019re running against something that is completely unpredictable,\u201d said one former campaign aide. \u201cThe electorate she could bring out would be unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before or could prepare for. It would be a dramatically different race.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump World is on alert over the energy that has grown around Warren\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe president has tweeted dismissively about Warren\u2019s crowds, but some of his allies view Warren\u2019s rallies as an indication of the grassroots support and enthusiasm around her campaign.\n\n\u201cShe has crossover appeal between mainstream Democrats and the progressive base where the energy is,\u201d said a former White House official. \u201cThat\u2019s a formidable place to be, so I think on the whole, Trump would rather face Biden.\u201d\n\nIndeed, many in Trump World view Biden as a weakened front-runner who will not be able to match Trump\u2019s strength or stamina on the campaign trail.\n\nThey say Biden has appeared confused and slow on the Democratic debate stage and believe Trump would destroy him in a one-on-one debate.\n\n\u201cThe more attention he has on him on a daily basis, the worse it is for him,\u201d said the Republican consultant. \u201cSo I\u2019d prefer Biden sneak out of this with a deflated base. That\u2019s the dream.\u201d\n\nStill, several Trump allies continue to view Biden as the toughest opponent in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. If the entire 2016 electoral map stays the same but Democrats win back those three states, they\u2019ll reclaim the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies say that an election between Biden and Trump would be nasty, and they fear that Biden might be the lone contender running who could match Trump for personal attacks. The fighting between the two is already growing in intensity as House Democrats launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump for allegedly urging the Ukrainian government to investigate the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump World is also hopeful that the Democratic primary continues to drag Biden to the left, believing that, for the time being at least, he has more mainstream appeal than the left-leaning candidates.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t gone as far to the left as Warren has,\u201d said the administration official. \u201cHe\u2019s still gotten out there, but it\u2019s harder to characterize him as a complete radical. And the contest between Biden and Trump wouldn\u2019t be even remotely policy based. It would be personal. That would make for some great prime-time television, but it would also present a unique challenge for the president.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s allies see reasons to worry about the rise of Sen.
