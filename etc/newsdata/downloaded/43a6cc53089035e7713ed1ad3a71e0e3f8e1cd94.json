Last Friday staff said it wouldn\u2019t be long and they helped us organise our wedding.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, Gary\u2019s cancer was extremely aggressive and doctors told him that he had just days to live. So his loved ones sprung into action to help Gary fulfill his dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Mum and I went out, got the rings, came back and we were told the staff had sorted it all,\u2019 added Laura.\n\n\u2018They said, \u2018We\u2019ve got your special marriage licence and a priest. You\u2019re getting married at seven o\u2019clock.\u2019\n\nGary, from Northampton, first fell ill in July when he came home from work with a bad back and chest pain.\n\n\u2018It was like everyone was saying goodbye to him at the same time\u2019 (Picture: Laura Smart / SWNS)\n\nHe was losing weight and was unable to sleep so went to the doctors who drained fluid from his lungs and did a biopsy. In September the pair were told that he had an aggressive form of lung cancer.\n\nPhotos show the pair exchanging rings and vows as Gary lay in his hospital bed, hooked up to machines to help him breathe.\n\nThe couple even laid out a buffet for guests to enjoy the ceremony.\n\nA buffet was provided for the 25 guests who came to the wedding (Picture: Laura Smart / SWNS)\n\n\u2018We had about 25 people there. We said we should have done it years ago,\u2019 said Laura.\n\n\u2018It was like everyone was saying goodbye to him at the same time. We all knew he was going to go.\u2019\n\nJust seven hours after making the marriage official, Gary passed away with his new bride at his side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He managed to say his vows and put the ring on my finger and give me a kiss,\u2019 she added. \u2018That night I laid in bed with him. We watched Fast and Furious 8 as he was into cars. I managed to fall asleep and woke up when the call button went off at 3 am.\n\n\u2018I looked at Gary and he was staring at me, like he was trying to reach out to me. I had a conversation with him and then realised, his oxygen mask was not on right and he wasn\u2019t breathing. We only had seven hours of marriage but I was so grateful I could give him that.\n\n\u2018He was a kind, lovely man. He loved his cars. He was always building things, offering to make things for people.\u2019\n\nMORE: Man sick of daily grind and city living quits job to climb all 1,001 mountains in the UK and Ireland\n\nMORE: Woman\u2019s PrettyLittleThing Halloween devil horns get stuck on her head\n\nMORE: There\u2019s a bank that gives out ice cream with an ATM that dispenses free toppings\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A dying man got to fulfil his final wish to marry his girlfriend by tying the knot from his hospital bed just hours before passing away.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_918113911_1571987316.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
