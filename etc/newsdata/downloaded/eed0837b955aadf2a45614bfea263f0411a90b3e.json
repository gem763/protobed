At first I could quite understand what noise it was.\n\n\u2018It was dark, there were no lights, there was some failure of the power line. I went out \u2013 and heard the noise of water.\n\nA team of doctors including a neurosurgeon were dispatched to the scene from Krasnoyarsk (Picture: Emergencies Ministry/TASS)\n\n\u2018It was coming closer and closer, I could understand nothing. And later, when I did see it, it was either a wave \u2026I ran to the nearest barracks to wake people.\n\nPassengers wrap drunk man in cling film after he tried to kick open plane door\n\n\u2018I understood that it was something very wrong, that it was flooding. When I woke up those who were not far from me, I ran further, to the settlement, and then I saw a hostel being carried by water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The hostel was floating and people were screaming \u2018help\u2019 from inside. The water level was very high Some 50 metres from me people were having resting.\n\n\u2018I rushed to wake them up. Those who died, they they were mainly in three big hostels. One was of three bedrooms, two others were, I think, of nine bedrooms each. \u2018\n\nHe said three hostels on the site had been wiped out by the wave of water.\n\nThe settlement\u2019s total population is estimated at about 180 (Picture: Emergencies Ministry/TASS)\n\nHe added: \u2018Two of our guys managed to swim out. One was rescued from water, he was alive, the second one was sent to the hospital.\u2019\n\nInvestigators said they have opened a criminal probe into the breach of safety rules.\n\n\u2018As of now, there\u2019s information about 13 dead,\u2019 the emergencies ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn a separate statement, the regional authorities in Krasnoyarsk said 12 people had died and 13 more were missing.\n\nFourteen people were hospitalised, and three of them were in a grave condition, the regional health ministry said.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nRegional governor Alexander Uss said in televised remarks that about 80 workers lived in the temporary settlement in the remote village of Shchetinkino located south of the city of Krasnoyarsk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe settlement\u2019s total population is estimated at about 180.\n\nA team of doctors including a neurosurgeon were dispatched to the scene from Krasnoyarsk, which is located some 2,500 miles east of Moscow.\n\nRussian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova was overseeing the delivery of aid to the injured.\n\nA number of top regional officials including Uss, prosecutors and inspectors went to the scene of the tragedy.\n\nAt least 13 people are known to have died but the death toll is expected to rise (Picture: Emergencies Ministry/TASS)\n\nThe dam was built in violation of \u2018every single norm,\u2019 the head of the local government, Yury Lapshin, said in televised remarks.\n\nBlack school worker fired for telling boy 'Don't call me a n*****'\n\nThe dam belonged to the Sibzoloto holding company which has not released any comment on the incident so far.\n\nMore than 270 people were involved in a search and rescue operation, the emergencies ministry said.\n\nBut the operation was challenging because of the remote location.\n\nDeadly accidents are relatively common in Russia because of lax safety rules, bad management and Soviet-era infrastructure.\n\nIn 2009, 75 people were killed in a massive flood at Russia\u2019s biggest hydroelectric plant in the Khakassia region of Siberia.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
