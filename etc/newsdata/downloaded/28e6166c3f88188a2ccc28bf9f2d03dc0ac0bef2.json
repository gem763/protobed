The party\u2019s leader Nigel Farage was the third-most trusted in that respect, with 29 per cent.\n\nThe top five considered to be \u201cmore on the side of the British Establishment\u201d were: the Conservative Party (42 per cent), Prime Minister Boris Johnson (36 per cent), \u201cMPs who want to remain in the EU\u201d (35 per cent), judges (32 per cent), and \u201cMPs who want to leave the EU without a deal\u201d (31 per cent).\n\nThe survey also found that trust in politicians and parties to put the nation first when it comes to Brexit is at a low of 17 per cent.\n\nTop Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker: Make 'Nuclear Weapon' Farage Britain's EU Commissioner https://t.co/GfwQ7Ek6IG \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 6, 2019\n\nDespite the Brexit Party being the most trusted political party to represent the people, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has again ruled out an election pact with Mr Farage.\n\nCentrist Tory MP and Remainer Damian Green told The Guardian on Wednesday that Johnson said he would not go into a pact with the Brexit Party. He also claimed the prime minister said he would not make leaving the EU in a clean-break a manifesto pledge.\n\n\u201cWe went in to say that no deal as the prime aim of government policy would be unacceptable in a manifesto and we were reassured that wasn\u2019t the prime minister\u2019s aim, that he still wants to get a deal now and still thinks that would be the best outcome. He has no intention of putting a no-deal policy in a manifesto,\u201d Mr Green said.\n\nLast month, Mr Farage announced that he would run as a parliamentary candidate in the next General Election. The Brexit Party leader says that the prime minister would need a strategic election pact to win a substantial majority for Brexit. Mr Farage predicted such a partnership could lead to up to a 100-seat majority.\n\n\u201cHere is a way for Boris to get a big, workable majority. We\u2019re happy to help with that,\u201d Mr Farage said in late September.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the party that believes in a clean-break Brexit because that\u2019s the only way that we can honour the referendum, and we\u2019ve said that if Boris Johnson\u2019s party goes for a clean-break then, of course, we ought to have a non-aggression pact.\u201d", "description": "The Brexit Party is trusted more than any other party or politician to be on the side of the British public.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/Nigel-Farage-2-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
