Additionally, Lockheed Martin is providing modification support services, analytical condition inspections, radar cross section turntable support and antenna calibration.\n\nWhat a War Between NATO and Russia Would Look Like.\n\nAlso, Air Force officials have told Scout Warrior that, by 2019, the service will begin upgrading F-22 functionality for the AIM-120D and AIM-9X Air-to-Air missiles as well as enhanced Air-to-Surface target location capabilities. The F-22 currently carries the AIM-9X Block 1 and the current upgrade will enable carriage of AIM-9X Block 2.\n\nRaytheon AIM-9X weapons developers explain that the Block 2 variant adds a redesigned fuze and a digital ignition safety device that enhances ground handling and in-flight safety. Block II also features updated electronics that enable significant enhancements, including lock-on-after-launch capability using a new weapon datalink to support beyond visual range engagements, a Raytheon statement said.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "It all starts with Synthetic Aperture Radar.", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MmjlAGH2VilKFg6FKIkquA--~B/aD05NjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/fecc4efc1936ab89c9b76c5160390d86", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
