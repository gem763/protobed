One particularly tried-and-true strategy is to replace depressing light fixtures with the classic hardware-store pairing of a white porcelain socket and a globe bulb ($9 for both), seen above. In this brass-obsessed design moment, the utilitarian favorite \u201cleaves things looking nicely unfinished,\u201d says David Netto, a Los Angeles\u2013based interior designer who learned about it from architect Annabelle Selldorf. \u201cThey\u2019re sexy in their simplicity.\u201d Other small but equally impressive fixes include adding a stately, plaster-esque ceiling medallion ($30) or swapping in a more traditional-feeling black toilet seat ($50), which can, surprisingly, make a world of difference. Ahead, a list of more high-impact, modestly priced upgrades gathered from decorators and aesthetes.\n\nSub in a non-hideous faucet\n\nJacuzzi Duncan faucet It\u2019s not an expensive, or difficult, thing to do these days \u2014 just make sure it matches all the rest of your metal fixtures, from your towel bar to your sink faucet handles to your toilet paper holder. Whether it\u2019s matte black, chrome, polished nickel, satin nickel \u2014 make them consistent. It bumps up the whole aesthetic of the space. \u2014Nye Basham, designer $89 at Lowe's Buy\n\nHardware-store pegboards make cheap key holders\n\nReplace your Home Depot boob lamp with a mint-green socket and oversize bulb\n\nHide bad floors (or carpet) with a huge sisal rug\n\nStick a Noguchi-style lantern over dumpy fixtures\n\n36-inch paper lantern Use with a porcelain socket or white-cord kit to replace any dumpy light fixture \u2014 the bigger the better, in my opinion. They work especially great over the dining table or in the bedroom. \u2014L.F. $28 at Paper Lantern Store Buy\n\nTurn carpet foam into Sottsass-esque cushions\n\nPhoto: Clemens Kois, Courtesy of Jonah Takagi Foam carpet padding, 1 roll I came across this foam in the hardware store. It kind of resembles a granite or terrazzo look. Top a layer of it on a plywood bench, and you have a cool cushion. \u2014Alex Proba, founder of Studio Proba $100 at Home Depot Buy\n\nDo cabinets over in matte-white paint \u2026\n\nPhoto: Simone Kitchens Rust-Oleum cabinet-coating kit You may have the dreaded orangey-grained \u201990s oak kitchen cabinets. If your landlord is cool with it, paint them with a cabinet kit. It comes with instructions, which are simple to follow. The main thing to know is that it takes a few days for each step \u2014 the de-glosser, the primer, the paint, and the clear topper \u2014 to dry, but it\u2019s quite transformative. And quite tackle-able for even the non-handy among us. \u2014Daniel King, co-owner of Home Union $80 at Home Depot Buy\n\n\u2026 And install a pot rack with three screws\n\nPhoto: COURTESY OF VENDOR Cuisinart half-circle pot rack $33 (was $120, now 73% off) Life is too short to spend time digging through cabinets and deep stacks looking for the pan you need. So get yourself a pot rack. I get tons of compliments on this one, from Cuisinart. It\u2019s easy to install (just three screws \u2014 make sure you find the studs) and doesn\u2019t take up a ton of wall space. \u2014Taryn Williford, Apartment Therapy editor $33 at Amazon Buy $33 at Amazon Buy\n\nChange unsightly cords to fabric ones\n\nCloth-covered wire Even expensive lamp cords tend to be quite ugly. An inexpensive solution is to swap in fabric cords. I like them in a classic brown or black, but a color can give a room a pop of fun. \u2014N.B. $2 at Color Cord Company Buy\n\nSimulate original plaster molding\n\nSwitch out floor grilles for a cohesive effect\n\nPhoto: COURTESY OF VENDOR Cast-iron floor register Cleaning up details you don\u2019t think get noticed but the eye takes in \u2014 like floor grilles \u2014 does a lot to elevate a space. \u2014Nicole Powell, co-founder of We Three Design $38 at Signature Hardware Buy\n\nGet non-dorm-room over-the-door hooks\n\nPhoto: COURTESY OF VENDOR Vinyl-coated hook McMaster-Carr\u2019s catalogue has a surprising number of stand-alone hardware pieces that are quite handsome when used in the right way. Like, for instance, this very nice-looking over-the-door coat hook. \u2014Shengning Zhang, furniture designer $12 at McMaster-Carr Buy\n\nBuild a coffee table out of Craigslist marble\n\nOr top it with Plexiglas\n\nPhoto: COURTESY OF VENDOR Acrylic sheet Go to Canal Plastics and have them cut custom clear-pink Plexiglas for table surfaces; depending on the size, it can be around $40. \u2014Amy Silver, set decorator From $40 at Canal Plastics Center Buy\n\nOr use all plywood for something Donald Judd\u2013inspired\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Donald Judd Furniture; Architecture Table 73 in clear birch plywood. www.judd.furniture Pine plywood sheathing Get plywood sheets at Home Depot \u2014 they\u2019ll cut notches in the wood for you. \u2014E.W. $14 at Home Depot Buy\n\nCreate a sculptural fixture with leftover cord\n\nPhoto: COURTESY OF VENDOR Cast triangle pendant Embrace the exposed-wiring look by choosing a fixture with an extra-long cord that can make geometric patterns on your walls and ceiling. The cone pendant above is from Flos, but Menu makes equally nice ones that are under $100. \u2014Ming Thompson, co-founder of Atelier Cho Thompson $80 at 2Modern Buy\n\nCover your Karlstad with a slipcover\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vendor Bemz slipcover Bemz slipcovers \u2014 which are made specifically for Ikea pieces \u2014 are machine washable. They\u2019re especially great for clumsy people like me who have always wanted \u2014 and been too afraid to own \u2014 white chairs. \u2014T.W. From $89 at Benz Buy\n\nSwap in a black toilet seat for a prewar feel\n\nPhoto: COURTESY OF VENDOR Mayfair toilet seat Change out your toilet seat for a black one. Make a note to be sure if you need round or elongated. It instantly makes any bathroom look more traditional. \u2014L.F. $50 at Home Depot Buy\n\nFake a Shaker dining room with DIY wainscoting\n\nPhoto: JORDAN SLOCUM AND BARRY BRODELON, THE BROWNSTONE BOYS Shaker profile panels It\u2019s super-simple: Just go to Wainscoting America\u2019s site and put in your room dimensions. We went with the Shaker style, but the raised panel is also nice, and a bit more traditional. Nail the panels to the wall, then paint them. It adds a ton of character. \u2014Barry Bordelon and Jordan Slocum, The Brownstone Boys From $83 at Wainscoting America Buy\n\nInstall dimmer switches for mood lighting\n\nSwap outdated handles for matte-black doorknobs\n\nSchlage Bowery knob Doorknobs in rentals can be hideous. Sub in a matte-black set with just a screwdriver in about five minutes. \u2014Fiona Byrne, designer $21 at Home Depot Buy\n\nUpgrade drawers with Lucite handles\n\nPhoto: COURTESY OF VENDOR Acrylic handle They look particularly great against a lacquered white finish \u2014 more on living-room furniture than in the kitchen. There\u2019s something about acrylic that feels ultra-modern, without being too bold or overpowering. \u2014Patricia Voto, designer at Gabriela Hearst From $8 at eBay Buy\n\nFake a concrete wall\n\nPhoto: Alexandra Ribar SureCrete SureTex Knockdown overlay, $36; white color additive, $4 Mix a white color additive into water (just a little), then stir that into the concrete overlay until it\u2019s a pancake-batter consistency. Use a drywall knife to spread the mixture over the wall, starting from the bottom and pulling it straight up. Finish with concrete sealer. \u2014L.F. $4 at Surecrete (Color additive) Buy $36 at Surecrete (Overlay) Buy\n\nUse raw glass to make a room feel gigantic\n\nPhoto: MIRRORCOOPERATIVE/ETSY DIY floor mirror Get a large piece of glass from Sam the Glazier in Bushwick (or any other glazier), and use it as a mirror. They\u2019ll sand down the edges for you on-site. \u2014E.W. $6 at Sam the Glazer Buy\n\nMake a bedside table out of a bucket of cement\n\nPhoto: Amy Harlow Home Depot five-gallon bucket, $4; Sakrete gray concrete mix, $4; Rubbermaid hardwood broom handle, $9 To make this little bedside table, pour cement into a bucket, filling it about a third of the way. Then take a wooden broomstick, cut it in thirds, and arrange \u201clegs\u201d into the cement. \u2014Amy Harlow, owner of Wagwear $4 at Home Depot Buy\n\nPour bulk Mrs. Meyer\u2019s soap into glass dispensers\n\nStain your faded grout a deep black\n\nPhoto: Duntrune Studios/Shutterstock / Duntrune Studios Grout Refresh If you can\u2019t get rid of sad, grayish grout, stain it black or a dark shade to make the grout color look modern and sharp. \u2014M.T. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nCover drab backsplashes with sticker decals\n\nSmart Tiles panels Short of renovating, not much is going to fix an ugly backsplash \u2014 but peel-and-stick tiles can hide it. I\u2019ve seen these up close, and they\u2019re a lot more convincing than you\u2019d think. If your tiles are a standard size, you can also find the type that cover each individual tile with a separate sticker (so you still see the grout lines), but they\u2019re a little less forgiving to install. \u2014T.W. $7 at Home Depot Buy\n\nInstall bamboo blinds for neutral texture\n\nPhoto: Taphat Wangsereekul/Shutterstock / Taphat Wangsereek Matchstick blinds There is something charmingly low-tech about these \u2014 especially in a bathroom or kitchen window. Light filters through them in a really lovely way. \u2014Kelly Behun, designer $18 at Matchstick Buy\n\nOr just go with space-enhancing linen curtains\n\n*A version of this article appears in the July 22, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
