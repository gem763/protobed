Jaguars\u2019 rookie QB and his outfits come to prime time", "language": "en", "text": "What they got with that 178th overall pick is a 23-year-old Mississippian with a bushy mustache, a mop of hair and an array of headbands, a guy who became a legend in Pullman, Wash., for his prowess on the field and the way he helped Washington State heal after the death of its quarterback. His nearly nude workouts in the weight room might get the headlines, but the legend of Minshew II does not end there.\n\nHe brings all of that into prime time Thursday night, when the Jaguars play the Titans, still looking for their first win of the season. Minshew nearly got them there last Sunday, but a two-point conversion that would have beaten the Houston Texans failed. In his first game, against the Kansas City Chiefs, Minshew completed 88 percent of his passes, the highest in NFL history for any player with at least 15 attempts making their NFL debut. Through his first two games, he has completed 45 of 58 passes for 488 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nJaguars-Titans: Live updates and analysis\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the saying? You better be ready for the opportunity of a lifetime during the lifetime of the opportunity,\u201d his mother, Kim, told the Spokesman-Review in January. \u201cAnd he\u2019s always been ready to take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nWhere to begin with someone who shows the kind of personality sometimes unwelcome in the NFL? Let\u2019s start with his look. Minshew became a social media phenom when he arrived for a game at Christmas last year wearing one of the most over-the-top outfits a QB has donned since the days of Joe Namath and his fur coat. It was a reddish suit, complemented with a white belt (of course), a shirt (we hope it was polyester) open to his sternum (revealing a thicket of chest hair), with a manly chain of a necklace and, duh, aviator shades on his unshaven and mustachioed face.\n\nJaguars by a million pic.twitter.com/f35J8wA8bn \u2014 Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) September 14, 2019\n\nFor his first regular-season road trip as a rookie, he was more low key, sporting a denim look.\n\nSaturday + Sunday: Gardner Minshew brought one pair of clothes to Houston. Anyone else think he\u2019s about to have a big day?? pic.twitter.com/mXnyA5GU0a \u2014 Michele Steele (@ESPNMichele) September 15, 2019\n\nBut who is the man behind the mustache and the partially clothed workouts? (That\u2019s right. He often has hit the weights wearing only a jock, shades and, of course, the headband. And sometimes he leaves out the jock.)\n\nA Brandon, Miss., native, Gardner Flint Minshew II could have come into the world as Beowulf Minshew if not for the good sense of his parents. \u201cMy dad wanted to name him Beowulf,\u201d his father, Flint Minshew, told the Spokesman-Review last spring, \u201cand that\u2019s about as far as that got.\u201d\n\nHe spent his first year of college at Troy on an academic scholarship in 2014, transferred to Northwest Mississippi Community College for a year and then moved to East Carolina in 2016, graduating in December 2017. Although he initially planned to attend Alabama, Washington State Coach Mike Leach made him an offer he could not refuse.\n\n\u201cDo you want to be a backup at Alabama or lead the nation in passing?\u201d Leach asked. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lead the nation in passing one way or another.\u201d\n\nAs a graduate student, he was immediately eligible to play behind the Cougars\u2019 projected starter, Tyler Hilinski. But Hilinski died by suicide in January, 2018 and Minshew stepped up in an incredibly difficult situation. He was a nice fit for more than just Leach\u2019s offense.\n\nGardner Minshew II has been everywhere, man\n\n\u201cIt was time for that community, going through a lot of healing with the passing of Tyler Hilinski,\u201d Minshew told reporters last week. \u201cJust really trying to honor that legacy and bring hope to a community that was pretty down.\u201d\n\nHe passed for 4,770 yards and 38 touchdowns with nine interceptions, setting school and conference records for completions for the 11-win team and finishing fifth in the Heisman balloting. His mustache, and his reputation, kept growing in Pullman, with fans wearing fake ones to games.\n\nMike Leach has once again produced possibly the greatest college football interview of all time pic.twitter.com/8Djm3VJ8RI \u2014 Paid man gets bored (@cjzero) November 11, 2018\n\nMinshew reportedly had the second-highest Wonderlic score among quarterbacks eligible for the draft last spring and, with Joshua Dobbs signing as his backup, he was asked recently if he and Dobbs, who has a degree in aerospace engineering, combined to give the Jaguars\u2019 quarterbacks room the highest IQ in the league.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of in his own deal, man. I\u2019ve got a communications degree. I know y\u2019all know about it,\u201d Gardner told reporters with a laugh. \u201cI belong in this [media] room more than that one.\u201d\n\nToo hot to handle. Too cold to hold. Rookie year let\u2019s get it! #OhYeeeaaah pic.twitter.com/djKx9laDEl \u2014 Gardner Minshew (@GardnerMinshew5) July 19, 2019\n\nAnd those naked workouts? \u201cThat\u2019s some college thing,\u201d running back Leonard Fournette said with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s his ritual and I\u2019m used to it now. Whatever makes him throw 88 percent [completions], he can have it. So I\u2019m not going to stop him.\u201d\n\nYes, Gardner Minshew also does exercise bands in the locker room wearing only a jock strap, shades, and a headband. Sometimes naked, too. Sometimes Steve Spurrier even walks in on him doing it https://t.co/e2ZFwk3aOT pic.twitter.com/ir63VnKPZJ \u2014 Brian Floyd (@BrianMFloyd) September 10, 2019\n\nIf everyone is talking about Minshew\u2019s mustache, his workout and travel attire, that\u2019s fine with Jaguars Coach Doug Marrone. Foles is not expected to return until at least Week 11 after having his collarbone surgically repaired with a plate and screws stabilizing the break.\n\n\u201cIf we can talk about [his mustache], then I know he\u2019s playing well,\u201d Marrone told reporters. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t play well, then I know we won\u2019t be talking about his mustache.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nTroy Aikman says NFL officiating issues are \u2018maddening\u2019 and \u2018nauseating\u2019\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 3: Bears, 49ers and Chiefs roll on\n\nTony Wyllie, Redskins\u2019 head of communications, is leaving the organization\n\nJerry Brewer: NFL rookie deals are the worst in sports, and some young stars have had enough\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening and the most flexible teams will thrive\n\nGiants\u2019 Pat Shurmur won\u2019t be back afta Mike Francesa blasts his team\n\nSaints fans cry foul after yet another bad call: \u2018We just want answers\u2019", "description": "Nick Foles's replacement brings a wacky look, and a solid game, to an NFL that could use a fresh face.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SA663YWX7UI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
