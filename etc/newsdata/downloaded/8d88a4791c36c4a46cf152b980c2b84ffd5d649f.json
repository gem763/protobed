The figure fell well short of a Bloomberg consensus forecast that estimated a rise from August\u2019s 49.1 reading, and sent the stock market reeling.\n\nThe data \u2014 in which respondents cited the U.S. China trade war as the overriding factor behind depressed hiring and business activity \u2014 sparked the president\u2019s ire, who blistered the Fed anew for not moving fast enough to lower rates. Trump has repeatedly savaged the central bank and Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u2014 and did so again on Tuesday for being \u201cpathetic\u201d in its response to the economic slowdown.\n\nAs I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies, they don\u2019t have a clue. Pathetic! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\n\u2018Tariffed our way into recession\u2019\n\nThe movement of the ISM data from 2013-2019. More\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street economists \u2014and the ISM survey respondents \u2014 cite the U.S.-China trade conflict as the proximate cause of the manufacturing sector\u2019s woes. Across a range of sectors, the organization\u2019s participants have blamed slower conditions on the after-effects of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs and retaliatory charges imposed by the world\u2019s two largest economies on each other\u2019s goods.\n\nCentral to the president\u2019s critique of the Fed is his belief that the central bank should be helping him \u201cwin\u201d against China, using monetary policy as a lever to offset the effects of higher tariffs and a dollar that\u2019s been bolstered by safe-haven buying.\n\nYet market veterans such as Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, have sharply criticized Trump\u2019s mercantilistic trade policies that embrace tariffs as a bargaining strategy.\n\n\u201cBottom line, we have now tariffed our way into a manufacturing recession in the US and globally,\u201d Boockvar said, asking what the exit strategy is with no end in sight to the standoff.\n\n\u201cSorry to have to say this again but using tariffs as the tool to push back against China was a really dumb idea and history will not look kind upon the strategy,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a research note to clients, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Torsten Slok wrote the ISM read was \u201cserious\u201d and warned that \u201cthere is no end in sight to this slowdown, the recession risk is real.\u201d\n\nJavier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
