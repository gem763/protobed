Several victims initially feared reporting the rapes, as well as threats and kidnapping, because of his authority as an officer, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cThe defendant is someone we all entrusted with a uniform, gun and badge and asked to serve our community,\u201d Deputy District Attorney Alpana Samant told the Palo Alto Daily Post. \u201cBut what he did was hunt and prey on the most vulnerable women in our society.\u201d\n\nPolice misconduct: We found 85,000 cops who\u2019ve been investigated for misconduct. You can read the records\n\nWinchester allegedly sexually assaulted women while working for the San Mateo Police Department in 2015, the Journal reported, and while serving as an officer for Sacramento's Los Rios Community College Police Department in 2013.\n\nWhen targeting victims, Wagstaffe told KPIX-TV that Winchester identified women who committed a minor offense. The former officer would also make sure no fellow officers were in the area during his assaults.\n\nThe San Mateo Police Department thanked the jury and District Attorney's Office for bringing Winchester to justice in a statement provided to the Journal.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure our community the actions of one in no way represent the men and women of the San Mateo Police Department as a whole, who strive to serve this community daily with the highest level of professionalism and service,\" the statement said.\n\nAuthorities arrested Winchester in July 2016, about five months after he quit his job in San Mateo amid a criminal investigation. He had since been in custody on $3.1 million bail.\n\nA judge is scheduled to determine Winchester's sentence in December. His attorney told the Post he plans to file for an appeal.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Ex-California police officer convicted for sexually assaulting 5 women", "description": "A California jury on Wednesday\u00a0found former police officer Noah White Winchester guilty of sexually assaulting five women while on duty.", "authors": ["Kristin Lam", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
