Sleepless nights, with 36-hour shifts every three to four days, were typical, and I was tired most of the time. None of this, however, prepared me for the exhaustion of having a newborn.\n\nGet the Parenting Newsletter Email Sign Up\n\nFor my wife and me, those early days passed in a blur. Nights seemed endless, and no government ordinance was about to come along to shorten our shifts. When he was around 3 months old, our son started sleeping for longer periods and our relief was profound. But after about a month, the baby started waking up at night again. After one nightly waking became two, then three and four, I realized it was time to sleep train our son.\n\nIn clinic, I help parents with their children\u2019s sleep problems. But in my own home, I found it challenging to apply the techniques I recommended to others. What seems obvious in a brightly-lit exam room is harder to follow at 2 a.m. Like many pediatricians do with their own children, I elected to try extinction sleep training, which involves letting a child cry in order to learn to soothe himself to sleep on his own. Night one was relatively easy, but night two left my wife in tears and me feeling like a heel. Things improved on night three, and our son scarcely cried on night four. By the end of the week, he was sleeping through the night again.\n\nThough many of the parents I see in clinic have put up with terrible sleep for years, sleep training is a safe and effective tool to help babies learn to soothe themselves at night. For this guide, I reviewed the literature on infant sleep. As director of the Pediatric Sleep Center at Yale University, I have extensive experience helping families to address sleep problems. I have also written a book on the topic, which was inspired by sleepless nights with my own children.", "description": "Sleep training is a safe and effective tool to help babies learn to soothe themselves at night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/multimedia/20parenting-sleep-train/20parenting-sleep-train-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-20"}
