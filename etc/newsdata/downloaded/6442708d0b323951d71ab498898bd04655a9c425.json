Honestly, the hypocrisy that comes from these people.\n\n\u2018They went to McDonald\u2019s to eat mass produced meat out of cardboard boxes.

We all want to save the planet. I\u2019m not lying down on the floor, defacing the white horse, paralysing traffic in London for two weeks and genuinely behaving like a total imbecile.
