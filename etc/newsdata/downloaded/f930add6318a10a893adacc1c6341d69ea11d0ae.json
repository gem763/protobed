He added that the U.K. proposals are merely a temporary way of avoiding a hard border in Ireland.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in London or anywhere else should be surprised that the EU is committed to getting operational, legally sound and sustainable solutions in this agreement,\u201d he told MEPs.\n\nBarnier argued that the U.K.\u2019s proposal for customs checks away from the border in Ireland hadn\u2019t been fully developed or tested and were based on technology that is not, as yet, available. He said the alternatives proposed do not provide the same security as the backstop, and said Northern Ireland should not have the power to unilaterally withdraw from the arrangement, as envisaged in the plan from London.\n\n\u201cBrexit is something that is long term, it creates specific, serious problems, first and foremost in Ireland. What we need is operational, legally binding solutions, today not tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nBarnier\u2019s strongly worded rebuke cast further doubt on the prospect of a Brexit deal being agreed by October 31.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker struck a more conciliatory tone, telling MEPs: \u201cWe remain in discussion with the U.K. on the terms of its departure. Personally, I don\u2019t exclude a deal.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cWe are not accepting this blame game which started in London. We are not to be blamed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of EU countries, Tytti Tuppurainen, the Finnish minister for European affairs, echoed Barnier\u2019s concerns. She said the U.K.\u2019s \u201cproposals do not yet provide a basis for concluding an agreement.\u201d\n\nShe said the EU remains \u201cfully committed\u201d to striking a Brexit deal but warned: \u201cThe U.K. crashing out is a dangerously realistic scenario.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Brexit is something that is long term, it creates specific, serious problems, first and foremost in Ireland.\u2019", "authors": ["Eleni Courea"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174721132-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
