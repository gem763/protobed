The wide receiver has signed a one-year deal with the New England Patriots, according to his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, who spoke to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter.\n\nBrown reportedly will get a deal worth up to $15 million, Rosenhaus said, with a $9 million signing bonus, $10 million guaranteed, and $5 million in incentives.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nHe now plays with the all-time greatest quarterback, Tom Brady, and helps Bill Belichick pursue yet another Super Bowl title.\n\nEARLIER: Controversial Oakland Raiders wide receiver Antonio Brown posted a rambling YouTube video of a private conversation he had with Raiders coach Jon Gruden on Friday, then demanded the team release him in an Instagram post on Saturday.\n\nHe got his wish, as the Raiders today released him, costing him more than $29 million in guaranteed money.\n\nIn the video, Gruden called Brown \u201cmisunderstood,\u201d and practically begged Brown to just play football.\n\nThe Raiders, who were featured on HBO\u2019s Hard Knocks this year, have been struggling with Brown all during the pre-season. First, he was injured in a bizarre cryo-therapy accident with his feet. Then he missed some time over an issue regarding his helmet.\n\nThe last straw was when he attacked general manager Mike Mayock, allegedly calling him a \u201ccracker\u201d after Mayock gave him a formal letter telling him of fines for missing practice.\n\nBrown was obtained by Oakland after a rocky break-up with the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he butted heads with teammates and particularly quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. He was given a record contract for a wide receiver by the Raiders, but that wasn\u2019t apparently enough to make him behave.\n\nHe is now an unrestricted free agent and can sign with any team, although he can\u2019t play a game until Week 2. But after two team-tearing controversies in a row, the 31-year-old Pro Bowler may have worn out his NFL welcome.\n\nView photos\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
