Sterling is down about 5% against the dollar from a year ago. However, expectations of a Brexit deal moved the currency about 3% higher earlier this month.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson made fresh proposals earlier this month to overcome differences over the controversial Irish backstop \u2014 an insurance policy that is meant to protect the EU's single market (an economic area with the same rules and standards) without imposing a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nLast week, the U.K. and the EU seemingly drew closer when it came to their long-standing differences over the issue when Johnson agreed that there could not be a customs border on the island of Ireland. As a result, teams from both sides entered the so-called tunnel discussions in Brussels, meaning only a restricted group of people has access to those talks.", "description": "Sterling rose sharply against the dollar Tuesday after optimistic comments on Brexit from EU negotiator Michel Barnier.", "authors": ["Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104444564-GettyImages-677321674.jpg?v=1532563853", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
