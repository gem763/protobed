During that time \u2014 around 45 minutes to an hour \u2014 Westerhout made the comments to the reporters.\n\nAfter the Aug. 17 dinner, which took place at the restaurant inside the nearby Embassy Suites hotel and included the Washington Post\u2019s Phil Rucker, Bloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs, Reuters\u2019 Steve Holland and the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Andrew Restuccia, Westerhout rode back to a different hotel, the Marriott, with Rucker and Holland.\n\nWhite House staffers having off-the-record dinners or drinks with reporters has long been a commonplace practice when a president is traveling.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

She kept largely to herself, several noted, but frequently posted pictures on Instagram of life in the White House.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s Tim Alberta reported in his recent book, \u201cAmerican Carnage,\u201d that Westerhout was observed crying on election night because she was unhappy that Trump had won. But she found her way into a top job at the White House, having previously worked at the Republican National Committee.\n\nDuring the transition period, Westerhout was known as \u201celevator girl\u201d or \u201cgreeter girl\u201d because she was often photographed escorting guests to see the then president-elect at his office at Trump Tower in Manhattan. She was previously an assistant to Katie Walsh, a top RNC official who also joined the White House, only to resign just months into her tenure as deputy chief of staff.\n\nWesterhout, 28, was a key gatekeeper for the president, screening his official calls and controlling the access of outside advisers. In February, she blasted an unknown person who leaked three months of his calendars to the press.\n\n\u201cWhat these don\u2019t show are the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday,\u201d Westerhout tweeted at the time. \u201cThis POTUS is working harder for the American people than anyone in recent history.\u201d\n\nWesterhout\u2019s public displays of loyalty ran her afoul of the Office of Special Counsel, which reprimanded her earlier this year for violating the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that prohibits federal officials from engaging in overtly political activity in the course of their official duties.\n\nAnd as one of a dwindling number of officials to have served in Trump\u2019s White House since its earliest days, she was an important source of continuity for a tumultuous presidency.\n\n\u201cMadeleine is the key,\u201d Trump told the Washington Post in a 2018 interview. \u201cShe\u2019s the secret.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials were buzzing all day on Friday, trying to understand her sudden firing.\n\n\u201cIt is a good reminder that we are all staff,\" a White House official said. \"We are all replaceable.\"\n\nNancy Cook contributed reporting.", "description": "The critical comments happened at an off-the-record dinner.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bd/a5/b45ad8914abcbd8d10931ffc50c1/20190829-madeleine-westerhout-ap-773.jpg"}
