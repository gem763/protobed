She admitted that limited gun purchases will not solve gun violence by itself, suggesting it is \u201cnot a one and done\u201d issue, but a very broad issue requiring numerous laws, regulations, changes.\n\nOn October 15, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren\u2019s plan to use excise taxes to reduce firearm and ammunition sales. The plan to use excise taxes was published by Medium where readers saw Warren\u2019s belief that the current ten percent excise tax on firearms is too low. She made clear she wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent.\n\nThis would immediately raise the price of a $500 gun to $650 and would increase the price of a $20 box of ammo to $30. Such taxation could render the Second Amendment cost-prohibitive for the poor.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
