It makes even less sense for the bankers. And that leaves SoftBank, which knows it overpaid earlier this year without strong anti-dilution protections.\n\nIf WeWork doesn't go public, SoftBank needn't write down the value of its investment. Or at least not until after Vision Fund 2 finishes fundraising.\n\nSoftBank already is dealing with Uber's public market flop.\n\nIt has added pressure with WeWork, given the perception that SoftBank pushed an accelerated expansion plan that led to nearly $2 billion in 2018 losses.\n\nBut, but, but: The trouble, of course, is that WeWork needs cash. From somewhere.\n\nIt only gets to access a fully-committed $6 billion credit facility if it raises at least $3 billion in the IPO by year-end.\n\nWeWork theoretically could restructure the loan based on a similarly-sized private infusion from SoftBank, but it's unlikely given that Wall Street wouldn't be able to play the trade's other side.\n\nSoftBank likely would prefer to be WeWork's bank, maybe even as a structured deal that wouldn't create a public mark (at least not yet).\n\nSure it might be overpaying yet again, but that delta would easily be swallowed up by Vision Fund 2 fees. So why not dish that the IPO is on the road to perdition? Or, if WeWork still persists, create the conditions for road-show failure, so that SoftBank can catch the ashes with a highly-structured pillow?\n\nThe bottom line: Late-stage venture capital has always been more about the money than the mission. This may the the starkest and highest-stakes example to date, and is playing out on front-pages instead of in backrooms.\n\nGo deeper: Dissecting the customer acquisition costs of the latest unicorn IPOs", "description": "We don't know if SoftBank leaked its resistance to moving forward with the IPO.
