Elizabeth Warren: How would she respond if a voter approached her and said, \u201cI\u2019m old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman?\u201d\n\nWarren (D-Mass.) responded with a theatrical seriousness. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that,\u201d she deadpanned, pausing a beat for the audience to catch the joke. Then she added, \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Then just marry one woman \u2014 I\u2019m cool with that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe finished with a zinger:\n\n\u201c \u2018Assuming you can find one.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter landing her punchline, Warren turned, took a few steps and smiled broadly as the room exploded in laughter. Her response went viral online, and by Friday afternoon, Warren\u2019s campaign team, which rarely brags about such things, was crowing that the clip had garnered more than 12 million views on Twitter.\n\nThe glitterati gushed. \u201cThe single greatest response to this question, in or outside politics,\u201d wrote actress Minnie Driver. \u201cMade my day,\u201d added actress Alyssa Milano. Javier Mu\u00f1oz, who recently played the title role in the smash musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d posted seven emoji of clapping hands.\n\nBut Republicans and some Democrats warned that the quip at the CNN-sponsored forum would play poorly among a big swath of voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about telling people who don\u2019t agree with you that they are backward by definition,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who advised Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential reelection campaign. The line was a \u201cstab\u201d to those who don\u2019t agree with her, he said, and \u201cit is a battle cry for men to turn out against Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nThe 44-second exchange captured the promise and peril of Warren\u2019s candidacy. She is quick-witted and sharp-tongued in a way that has played well in the Democratic primary and could prove effective against President Trump. But conservatives warn that she can come off as condescending and dismissive.\n\nWarren is working hard to present herself as a scrappy fighter from Oklahoma, in other words, but to critics she can come off as the lecturing Harvard professor.\n\nFor many liberals, the rapid-fire answer showcased her ability to take on Trump. \u201cIt was genius \u2014 it shows the real Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist who is not affiliated with a presidential campaign. \u201cIt was off-the-cuff and it was devastating, with a smile, a wink, a turn of the heel and a chuckle. Everybody got it.\u201d\n\nBut Sheinkopf suggested Warren was playing to her liberal studio audience, and he warned that such comments could alienate voters in the South and upper Midwest. \u201cWould she say the same thing at a dinner in Birmingham, Alabama?\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d\n\nRepublicans noted that Warren\u2019s comment went beyond stating a position to ridicule those who have a different view on same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insulting,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, the former spokesman to President George W. Bush. \u201cThe notion that there is only one thought that is acceptable, and if you don\u2019t hold it there is no one on Earth who should find you attractive, is insulting and demeaning.\u201d\n\nFleischer said politicians should avoid disparaging those who disagree with them, stressing that he has also criticized Trump when he has insulted opponents.\n\n\u201cYou cannot call people to a higher purpose if you yourself are going to sink to a lower one,\u201d he said.\n\nWarren is hardly the first Democrat to be accused by conservatives of being condescending toward white working-class Americans. Candidate Barack Obama angered some voters in 2008 with his description of \u201cbitter\u201d working-class Americans who \u201ccling to guns or religion.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton prompted a backlash in 2016 by labeling some of Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cdeplorables.\u201d That remark haunted her throughout the campaign and beyond, and some analysts contend that it helped drive up turnout for Trump.\n\nWarren\u2019s supporters say her acerbic tone Thursday was appropriate, given that it was aimed at people who want to deny gays and lesbians the fundamental right to marry.\n\nSeveral Democrats noted that support for same-sex marriage has grown quickly in the United States, putting Warren\u2019s views in line with those of many voters. More than 60 percent of Americans favor same-sex marriage, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Roughly three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters support it, the poll found. Among Republicans, about 44 percent of voters favor the policy.\n\nAnd those who do not, Warren\u2019s supporters say, would be unlikely to support her in any case.\n\nStill, one issue for Warren could be how such comments play with black voters, some of whom are socially conservative. Warren probably will need to appeal to African Americans to secure the Democratic nomination and win the White House, but has so far made few inroads with the black community.\n\nOlder and more religious black voters in particular may be less likely to find Warren\u2019s joke funny, several strategists said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how that resonates with older African American voters, especially African American women,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a black Democratic strategist based in South Carolina. \u201cI\u2019m especially not sure what discussions might carry over to the barbershops this weekend.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s the place in many communities that everyone comes to talk politics and the happenings of the day.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s staff argued that the comments will not hurt her standing. They pointed to the second, less viral portion of her answer.\n\nThese additional remarks came after CNN host Chris Cuomo pressed her on whether, in her earlier years as an Oklahoma Republican, she had ever opposed same-sex marriage. She said her position has been consistent, citing her religion.\n\n\u201cIt is about the worth of every human being,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe hatefulness frankly always really shocked me, especially for people of faith, because I think the whole foundation is the worth of every single human being.\u201d\n\nJohn Ziegler, an anti-Trump conservative, said Warren\u2019s words conveyed no such generosity. Her message and her body language, he said, telegraphed a dislike of men.\n\nTrump voters in places such as the Florida Panhandle and central Pennsylvania, he said, will think, \u201c \u2018Oh my God \u2014 this woman hates us.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt plays right into the narrative about her, which is that she\u2019s an out-of-touch liberal from Massachusetts, and this whole obsession with wokeness that the Democratic Party has where the white male is under attack,\u201d Ziegler said.\n\nWarren\u2019s viral moment was the latest example of online combat at which she has often excelled. She recently batted down a conservative troll who made an unsupported accusation that she had an affair with a much younger man by pivoting to her hardscrabble upbringing. She even found a way to play on the term \u201ccougar,\u201d slang for a woman who is involved with a younger man.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston (go Cougars!)\u201d she wrote in a tweet that was shared more than 24,000 times. \u201cWe need to cancel student debt and make college free for everyone who wants it.\u201d\n\nShe also hit back quickly this week when conservatives pushed the idea that she had lied about being fired from an early teaching job in the 1970s due to a pregnancy. Women across the country came to her defense, reacting with their own stories of losing work because they were starting a family.\n\nOne pollster who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person works for a competing campaign said the LGBTQ joke highlighted Warren\u2019s sense of humor, which the pollster said can be tricky, especially for female candidates. The joke could appeal in particular to younger voters, the pollster said.\n\nWarren\u2019s regular stump speech shows flashes of offbeat humor, though it usually follows a fairly rigid script. Thursday, in contrast, Warren appeared to let her guard down.\n\n\u201cI thought it was funny,\u201d offered former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell (D), who is supporting former vice president Joe Biden. \u201cI would not say in any way, shape or form that it will slow her candidacy down.\u201d", "description": "The senator cracks a joke about opponents of same-sex marriage, winning cheers and laughter from liberals but warnings that she risks turning off a big part of the electorate.", "authors": ["Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ip6jq6xqoh_SIFyVMes3JdstSlM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DI6MTPHMIYI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
