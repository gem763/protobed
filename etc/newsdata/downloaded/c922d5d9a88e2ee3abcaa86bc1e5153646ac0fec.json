(AP) - Oklahoma\u2019s history is so deeply intertwined with the 39 Native American tribes located there that the state\u2019s creation in 1907 was celebrated with a symbolic wedding ceremony between the Indian and Oklahoma territories.\n\nThe relationship between Oklahoma and the tribes has sometimes been contentious, but one of its undisputed successes has been a 15-year-old agreement to expand gambling in the state.\n\nSince the tribes got the exclusive right to open casinos, Native American gambling has become a bigger economic factor in Oklahoma than in any other state except California. Dozens of casinos, including several glittering Las Vegas-scale complexes, generate more than $2 billion a year, with $139 million going to the state\u2019s coffers last year.\n\nBut gambling money has changed more than the tribes\u2019 bank accounts. It has greatly increased their political muscle, as the state\u2019s new Republican governor recently discovered. After a clash with tribal leaders, Gov. Kevin Stitt and political supporters are facing a test of tribal power that now extends well beyond the state\u2019s Native American population into the economy of many Oklahoma towns.\n\nThe dispute flared up suddenly when Stitt, a businessman who won election last year, announced in an op-ed piece plans to renegotiate the state\u2019s share of casino revenue, which now ranges from 4% to 10% and funds mostly schools. Stunned, the tribes unleashed a multimillion-dollar advertising and political offensive to kill the idea.\n\nThe campaign, which took many political leaders by surprise, underscored a new reality in a place once ruled primarily by the oil and gas industry, but where tribal money now buys firetrucks, pays for school trips, floats rural economies and supports nearly 100,000 jobs statewide.\n\n\u201cThe tribes are the best friend the state of Oklahoma has right now,\u201d said Rep. Matt Meredith, whose district in eastern Oklahoma is home to the Cherokee Nation, the largest tribe in the U.S. \u201cThe last thing you want to do with your best friend is get in a legal battle with them.\u201d\n\nHow the dispute will be resolved is unclear. The governor insists the current revenue agreement expires Jan. 1, while the tribes say it automatically renews. The state has hired a national law firm to negotiate with Native American leaders, who are calling on support from their wide network of local allies.\n\nThe governor and Attorney General Mike Price both declined to discuss the talks because of the \u201cdynamic and delicate nature\u201d of the matter, said Alex Gerszewski, spokesman for the state attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nFor years Native American tribes have struggled to improve their economic position in what was once Indian Territory. The federal government resettled dozens of tribes in this part of the nation\u2019s midsection after expelling them from other regions in the 19th century, but then gradually whittled away at the tribes\u2019 communal property here to make way for white settlement and eventual statehood. In the last century, the tribes in Oklahoma used their remaining assets to operate businesses and provide clinics, housing and other services for their members.\n\nBut the financial picture, both for the tribes and the state, changed dramatically after Oklahoma voters approved casino gambling in 2004 and the tribes received an exclusive concession. The overall economic impact on Oklahoma has amounted to $9.2 billion annually, according to a 2019 study.\n\nMassive resort-style hotel casinos that feature a parade of major entertainment acts have popped up in large cities - the Tulsa area alone has a half dozen - and along the state\u2019s border with Texas, which only has limited gambling and provides a wealthy flow of customers.\n\nAt the first exit north of the Red River lies the Winstar World Casino and Resort, with the largest gambling floor in the nation, surpassing those on the Las Vegas strip. Owned by the Chicakasaw Nation, the resort has 1,400 rooms in three hotel towers, two 18-hole championship golf courses, shops and more than a dozen restaurants.\n\nOn the state\u2019s northeastern border with Kansas and Missouri lies the Downstream Casino Resort, owned by the 3,240-member Quapaw Nation. Tribal leaders started a cattle operation to supply food for the casino, along with a brewery and other businesses.\n\n\u201cBefore gaming we had less than 40 employees, and today we employ close to 2,000 people all in,\u201d said the tribe\u2019s chairman, John Berrey.\n\nEven small towns in rural areas have their own mini-casinos, and the money filters through counties that had been declining economically.\n\nIn downtown Sulphur, 90 minutes south of Oklahoma City, the Chickasaw Nation built a four-story hotel and spa that hosts prom night for half a dozen area high schools. A new state-of-the art, 72-bed medical facility in Ada employs 1,600 people.\n\nThe benefits have come with social ills, including cases of problem gambling, embezzlement and family disruption that have prompted continued opposition from some community groups and social conservatives.\n\nBut the economic boost has lifted spirits where there long had been hardship, said Bob Blackburn, the Oklahoma Historical Society director and author of a book on the Cherokee Nation. He cited a growing sense of \u201cself-determination, self-reliance.\u201d\n\nStitt has said the state\u2019s share of tribes\u2019 casino revenue was \u201cfair to help introduce the gaming industry\u201d years ago but that today, \u201cOklahoma\u2019s fees are the lowest in the nation.\u201d\n\nBut available data from the 24 states with Native American gambling shows a wide variance. A 2015 federal analysis of 276 tribal compacts shows Oklahoma\u2019s 6% average revenue share close to the national median. More than 100 tribes pay no fees while about 120 pay more than 10%. About a dozen pay between 20% and 25%. Oklahoma\u2019s 4% to 10% revenue share varies depending on the type of game.\n\nIn addition to the blast of television and social media ads emphasizing the casinos\u2019 economic importance, the tribes have spent to influence policy makers. Tribes doled out more than $1.1 million during the last two election cycles to state candidates from both parties.\n\nThe annual legislative retreats for both House Republicans and House Democrats were held this year at tribal resorts.\n\nSince Stitt\u2019s election last year with 54% of the vote, the majority Republican legislature has been supportive of his initiatives, including giving him expanded powers to appoint heads of state agencies. But many wonder whether even a popular Republican governor now has the clout to challenge the tribes in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cThe tribes are so influential now, and they\u2019ve ramped it up a lot,\u201d said Rep. Lewis Moore, a Republican from the Oklahoma City area. \u201cAnd the way they\u2019re going to do that is through their lobbyists. And if you personally have a business or live in these tribal areas, you\u2019re going to get even more pressure.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Sean Murphy at www.twitter.com/apseanmurphy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oklahoma's history is so deeply intertwined with the 39 Native American tribes located there that the state's creation in 1907 was celebrated with a symbolic wedding ceremony between the Indian and Oklahoma territories.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sean Murphy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/tribal_power_oklahoma_61300_c0-84-2022-1263_s1200x700.jpg?73795f545258b862199ef42af3f57c7b068448ab", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
