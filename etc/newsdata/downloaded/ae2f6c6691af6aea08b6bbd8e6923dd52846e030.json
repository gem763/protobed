Can Banana Leaves Be Part of the Solution?", "language": "en", "text": "In a photo provided by PristmanGoode, a water bottle created by the design firm to fit more easily in a passenger\n\nFrom disposable headphones and plastic cutlery to food scraps and toilet waste, the average airline passenger leaves behind over 3 pounds of garbage, according to one estimate. To get travelers and airlines thinking \u2014 and talking \u2014 about that rather large pile of trash, a British design firm has refashioned the economy meal tray, replacing plastic with renewable materials such as coffee grounds, banana leaves and coconut wood.\n\nJo Rowan is the associate strategy director of the firm, PriestmanGoode, which has spent more than two decades applying design thinking to the air travel experience, including airport lounges and cabin seating.\n\nNow, she said, the firm is turning its attention to the less \u201cglamorous\u201d side of things.\n\n\u201cOnboard waste is a big issue,\u201d she said. \u201cKnowing that you have 4 billion passengers per year, it all adds up very quickly.\u201d\n\nThe redesigned items are featured in an exhibit, \u201cGet Onboard: Reduce.Reuse.Rethink,\u201d that opened last month at the Design Museum in London.\n\nBy far the biggest environmental issue with air travel \u2014 and the reason 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg opted to sail to New York from Europe in August, rather than fly \u2014 is the associated carbon emissions, which are growing at a faster rate than predicted in previous, already dire projections.\n\nBut as air travel becomes increasingly accessible, and as more people take to the skies, airlines have been making public pledges to curb their environmental footprints, including the plastic forks and leftovers their passengers leave behind.\n\nHow much trash are we talking about?\n\nBecause there is no central authority tracking statistics about the amount of waste produced on flights, accurate and recent figures are hard to come by. But the International Air Transport Association, a trade group representing about 300 airlines, conducted a small study at Heathrow Airport in London and estimated that airlines generated about 6.7 million tons of cabin waste last year.\n\nAs low-cost airlines proliferate, and as the tourism industry continues to court middle-class customers, that number could double in the next decade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively limited sample at this stage,\u201d Chris Goater, a spokesman for the trade association, said.\n\nPere Fullana i Palmer, director of the UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change, a research group based in Barcelona, Spain, has taken an even deeper dive into the issue of airline trash.\n\n\u201cYou cannot improve a system if you don\u2019t know it,\u201d he said.\n\nFullana i Palmer\u2019s research group teamed up with Iberia Airlines, Gate Gourmet, Ferrovial and Ecoembes to analyze approximately 8,400 pounds of garbage on 145 flights into Madrid. The group found that 33% was food waste, 28% was cardboard and paper waste, and about 12% was plastic.\n\nHow can this be fixed?\n\nAs consumers become increasingly conscious of the outsize environmental impact of air travel, airlines are under growing pressure to take action.\n\nAlaska Airlines, Ryanair and British Airways have made public declarations to reduce waste, and Air France said it would eliminate 210 million single-use plastic items like cups and stirring sticks by the end of this year.\n\nOn one Qantas flight in May, which the company called \u201cthe first-ever commercial flight to produce no landfill waste,\u201d the airline removed individually packaged servings of milk and Vegemite, and served meals in containers made from sugar cane, with utensils made of crop starch.\n\nA month later, on a flight from Chicago to Los Angeles, United Airlines served meals using \u201cfully recyclable or compostable serviceware.\u201d\n\nBut replicating such innovations on a meaningful scale will be tricky. Regular flights are not equipped with the necessary facilities or systems for attendants to manage recycled goods, according to Megan Epler Wood, the author of \u201cSustainable Tourism on a Finite Planet\u201d and the director of Harvard\u2019s International Sustainable Tourism Initiative. (On a recent trip, Wood said, she saw a flight attendant separating recyclables with her bare hands.)\n\nThe solution, she said, would require collaboration among airlines, local authorities and airports, which are ultimately responsible for handling and hauling trash.\n\nIATA, the airline trade association, said the rules governing international catering waste \u2014 which involve a complex set of international and country-specific regulations meant to prevent the spread of disease \u2014 should be reconsidered to increase recycling rates.", "description": "From disposable headphones and plastic cutlery to food scraps and toilet waste, the average airline passenger leaves behind over 3 pounds of garbage, according to one estimate.
