He\u2019s a grown-up player, he\u2019s not a kid anymore, and football-wise, he\u2019s exceptional.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChilwell has also discussed the speculation linking him with a move to Liverpool in 2016, telling Sky Sports this week: \u2018I was 17 at the time.\n\n\u2018My agent was the one dealing with it all, talking to Liverpool and Leicester about the situation.\n\n\u2018At the time, I was trying to break into the U21 team at Leicester so I was just focused on getting into that and progressing into the first team here.\n\n\u2018Definitely no regrets. When I look at how the last four or five years have gone, starting eight games now for the England team is something I\u2019m very happy with.\n\n\u2018Leicester was the right place for me to be at the time and the older players have helped me a lot. The staff have kept me grounded. Definitely no regrets.\u2019\n\nKlopp, meanwhile, has warned his Liverpool players about the threat of Leicester and England striker Jamie Vardy.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe said: \u2018Jamie is always on your shoulder. He\u2019s good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not his only skill but he wants those situations and gets them. You have to make sure these situations don\u2019t happen that often.\n\n\u2018But they are much more flexible \u2013 it\u2019s not like their first ball is always one in behind. It feels like if someone put in a ball behind me, Vardy would be there!\u2019\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made \u2018big mistake\u2019 with Alexis Sanchez, says Danny Murphy", "description": "Jurgen Klopp admits Liverpool were interested in signing Ben Chilwell but says Leicester City prevented the defender from leaving the King Power Stadium.
