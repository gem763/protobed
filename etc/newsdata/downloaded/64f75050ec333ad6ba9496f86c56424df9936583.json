He was telling me that he missed having a kitchen because he loved to cook. Perfect. My prince.\"\n\nTheir first night ended together with Bundy cooking Elizabeth breakfast and the following weekend he whisked her away to Vancouver.\n\nAs the relationship progressed, Elizabeth says she began to notice strange quirks about her new love.\n\nOn one occasion she called her friend when she discovered women's underwear and plaster of Paris among Bundy's possessions in a desk drawer.\n\n(Image: Bettmann Archive)\n\nWhen Elizabeth confronted him, Bundy said: \"If you ever tell anyone this I'll break your effing head.\"\n\nThe couple's relationship continued in a tumultuous fashion.\n\nSix months after they met the pair applied for a marriage license, only for Bundy to tear it up in rage on their way home from the court house following an argument.\n\nThree years after they met, Elizabeth found out she was pregnant with Bundy's baby - which she admits left her 'distraught.'\n\n\"Both of us knew it would be impossible to have a baby now,\" she wrote. \"He was going to start law school in the fall, and I needed to be able to work to put him through. I was distraught. I knew I was going to terminate the pregnancy as soon as I could. Ted, on the other hand, was pleased with himself. He had fathered a baby.\"\n\n(Image: Universal Images Group Editorial)\n\nWhile Bundy was never violent towards Elizabeth, she reveals in her book how he could hurt her with his rage and cruel words.\n\nLocal news reports began circulating at the time of a man named 'Ted' who drove a Volkswagen committing terrible crimes undetected.\n\nOne of the daily reports claimed the man's arm was in a cast - remembering the plaster of Paris, Elizabeth admits she began to feel suspicious.\n\n(Image: ABACA USA/Empics Entertainment)\n\nIn August 1974, she made contact with the Seattle Police department.\n\nElizabeth told how she'd discovered crutches in her boyfriend's room that were similar to ones used in a recent attack.\n\n\"We\u2019re too busy to talk to girlfriends over the phone,\" Elizabeth was told.\n\nBundy's move to Utah months later coincided with the number of suspicious disappearances in the state increasing.\n\nA wary Elizabeth went back to the police but they told her Bundy had been cleared.\n\nHe was finally arrested in March 1976 for the attempted kidnapping Carol DaRonch.\n\nWhile he was on trial, Bundy and Elizabeth continued to communicate with each other through a series of passionate love letters.\n\nElizabeth also went to visit him and said she believed him when he insisted he was innocent.\n\nAs the charges began to stack up, Elizabeth asked her partner if he'd ever tried to murder her.\n\n(Image: Popperfoto)\n\nBundy confessed that he'd once closed the chimney and put a towel under her door to let the room fill with smoke as Elizabeth slept - but she woke up from a coughing fit.\n\nKiller Bundy was eventually convicted of 30 murders and after escaping jail twice, was executed in 1989.\n\nWhile Elizabeth managed to live a relatively quiet life away from the spotlight.\n\n(Image: Wicked Nevada)\n\nHowever, Elizabeth is set to break her silence for the first time on camera as part of a new Amazon Prime documentary.\n\nThe five-part series - Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer - is due to air in 2020.\n\nAccording to the streaming service, the show will feature in-depth interviews with both Elizabeth and her daughter Molly, who will share their experiences of living with Bundy.\n\nstatement from Amazon explained:\"After nearly 40 years of silence, Elizabeth Kendall and her daughter Molly share their experiences with unsettling new details about Bundy, the pull he had on women and an abundant archive of never-before-seen family photos.\"\n\nThe show will also examine what drove Bundy to kill.\n\nThe statement added: \"Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer reframes Bundy\u2019s crimes from a female perspective \u2013 uncovering the disturbing and profound way in which Bundy\u2019s pathological hatred of women collided with the culture wars and feminist movement of the Seventies, culminating in what is perhaps the most infamous true-crime saga of our time.\"\n\nElizabeth's book The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy will also be updated and released in January 2020 as a companion to the documentary.", "description": "Elizabeth Kloepfer survived a relationship with notorious serial killer Ted Bundy", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Amazon Prime", "Wicked Nevada", "Bettmann Archive", "Universal Images Group Editorial", "Abaca Usa Empics Entertainment", "Popperfoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641476.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Elizabeth-and-Molly.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
