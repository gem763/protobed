Together, the potential of these \u201chydrated\u201d asteroids is unparalleled as they should be enough to fill nearly 320,000 Olympics-size swimming pools \u2014 significantly more than the amount of water locked up at the lunar poles, according to the study.\n\nIf there was a way to successfully establish refueling stations on these orbiting asteroids, says asteroid researcher and lead author of the paper, Andrew Rivkin, human space exploration could unlock a \u201clevel-up\u201d moment. There would be no need to send fuel from Earth anymore, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to bring fuel from asteroids to geosynchronous orbit than from the surface of the Earth,\u201d Rivkin says. \u201cIf such a supply line could be established, it could make asteroid mining very profitable.\u201d\n\nSo far there are at least two asteroid mining companies \u2014 Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries \u2014 and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) looking into the feasibility of the extraterrestrial endeavor.\n\nRelated: Saudi Aramco Restores Oil Production Capacity To Pre-Attack Levels\n\nIn 2015, former US President Barack Obama signed a law that grants US citizens rights to own resources mined in space. The ground-breaking rule was touted as a major boost to space mining because it encourages the commercial exploration and utilization of resources from asteroids obtained by US firms.\n\nShortly after, Luxembourg launched an official initiative to promote the mining of asteroids for minerals. The tiny European country, which has been studying possible involvement in the sector since 2013, aims to become Europe\u2019s centre for space mining.\n\nRelated: \u2018\u2019Too Much Too Fast\u2019\u2019 Gas Glut Crushes Shale Drillers\n\nCanada is also eying the moon. Last year, Northern Ontario-based Deltion Innovations partnered with Moon Express, the first American private space exploration firm to have been granted government permission to travel beyond Earth\u2019s orbit, on future opportunities in outer space.\n\nSome of the space ventures in the works include plans to mine asteroids, track space debris, build the first human settlement in Mars, and billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s own plan for an unmanned mission to the red planet.\n\nGeologists as well as emerging companies, such as US-based Planetary Resources, a firm pioneering the space mining industry, believe asteroids are packed with iron ore, nickel and precious metals at much higher concentrations than those found on Earth, making up a market valued in the trillions of dollars.\n\nBy Mining.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Moon mining has never been closer, and thanks to a new study, asteroids could soon unlock a \u201clevel-up\u201d moment in space exploration", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
