While the raid and subsequent processes of identification and body \u2018disposal\u2019 were documented in numerous photos and videos, they are yet to go through a \u201cdeclassification process,\u201d according to the US general.\n\nWe are not prepared at the time to release those.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018All we have are Trump\u2019s words\u2019: UN isn\u2019t confirming elimination of IS chief al-Baghdadi\n\nEven though Donald Trump said earlier he was considering making \u201ccertain parts\u201d of the video from the raid available to the public \u2013 presumably with al-Baghdadi \u201cwas whimpering, screaming, and crying\u201d as he met his end \u2013 it remains unclear how much of footage would see the light, if any.\n\nThe Obama administration never publicly released any video footage of the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, or photos of his body, claiming they could pose a \u201cnational security risk.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s public announcement that al-Baghdadi had finally been neutralized, this time for real, sounded \u201cconfident,\u201d but has yet to be backed up by hard evidence, the UN Monitoring Team on terrorist groups said previously. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry questioned at least parts of the story, noting that despite Trump\u2019s claims, it never opened up the Syrian air space under its control to US jets, and didn\u2019t record any US coalition airstrikes in the area.\n\nAlso on rt.com Where is the proof? We\u2019ve been here before, Al Baghdadi\u2019s been reported dead or fatally injured many times\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
