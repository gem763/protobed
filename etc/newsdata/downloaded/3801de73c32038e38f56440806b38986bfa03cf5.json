He will report to Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, Google said.\n\nSoltero left Microsoft in November 2018 as the tech giant was reorganising its Microsoft Office division. In his new role as Vice President of G Suite, Soltero will compete directly with the Microsoft Office business.\n\nG Suite, Google's collection of productivity apps, includes products like Gmail and word processing apps, Sheets and Docs, as well as the calendaring app. The individual products are free for consumers, but Google sells fuller-featured versions of the products to business users for monthly fees.\n\nSoltero is the latest addition to the Google Cloud senior ranks, as the internet search company ramps up its efforts to catch up with Amazon and Microsoft, the two lead companies in the fast-growing cloud business.\n\nHe joined Microsoft in 2014, when it acquired Acompli, a mobile email startup that he co-founded and served as the CEO for. After the acquisition, Acompli's app was rebranded as the Outlook app for iPhone and Android. Soltero's position in the company skyrocketed as a result and he was eventually leading Outlook across all platforms and then leading strategy for all of Microsoft Office.\n\nHe took over the Cortana business in March 2018, as Microsoft aimed to transition Cortana to an AI powered assistant within its Microsoft Office applications, eventually putting the division under the Microsoft Office umbrella. Cortana competes with other AI voice assistants Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and the Google Assistant.\n\nTo that end, Soltero's experience with Cortana could help him further develop G Suite's use of the Google Assistant within its applications. In a prepared statement Soltero cited Google's broad reach and its ability to develop \"newer, better ways to collaborate at home, at school, and at work.\"\n\nAs of Q4 of 2018, Google says it has five million paying businesses using G Suite.\n\nPrior to his time at Microsoft and Acompli, Soltero was in senior leadership positions at VMware, after his first company Hyperic was acquired.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Google has hired Microsoft's former head of Cortana, Javier Soltero, as its new VP of G Suite.
