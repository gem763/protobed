I have been working for it. I just take it and I hope I\u2019m going to do much more.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Russia\u2019s Medvedev continues sensational form as he mauls Zverev to win Shanghai Masters\n\nMedvedev\u2019s run of form this year has indeed been \u201coutrageous\u201d: nine appearances in finals, four titles, a world-leading 46 hard-court wins, and 29 victories in 32 matches since July.\n\nIn reaching the last stage in Shanghai, Medvedev became just the seventh player since the turn of the century to rack up six or more consecutive appearances in finals; to put that into perspective, the other men in that bracket are Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, and former stars Marat Safin and David Ferrer.\n\nElite company indeed.\n\nAs Medvedev himself said, he is giving tennis fans \u201csomething new\u201d \u2013 or, more specifically, a fresh face who can challenge the stranglehold that Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have held at the top of the game for so long.\n\nMedvedev\u2019s meteoric rise has seen him propelled into the world\u2019s top four, while has now moved ahead of Federer into third in \u2018The Race to London\u2019 \u2013 which counts current season form ahead of the year-ending ATP Finals.\n\nGiven his current form, the question now is just how much higher the lofty Russian can go with his ascent.\n\nHe is next slated for action at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna in one week\u2019s time, but has the more mouthwatering prospect of the ATP Masters 1000 event in Paris at the end of the month \u2013 a tournament which will also include Djokovic, Federer and Nadal.\n\nVictory there, or doing something significant at the season-ending ATP Finals in London in November, would lay down a further marker ahead January\u2019s Australian Open, a tournament where Medvedev fell to Djokovic in four sets in the fourth round earlier this year.\n\nMedvedev is already breathing down the necks of Nadal, Djokovic and Federer, but to reach the top of the pile he will clearly need to improve his record against them: Medvedev is a respectable 3-2 down in meetings with Djokovic, but is 0-3 in matches against Federer and winless in two encounters with Nadal.\n\nThe last of those matches with the Spaniard was the epic five-set US Open final in September, which was Medvedev\u2019s maiden appearance in a Grand Slam decider.\n\nREAD MORE: Rafael Nadal edges 5-set thriller against Daniil Medvedev to capture US Open glory\n\nThat showed just how close Medvedev is to glory at a Major, but also just tightly the Big Three will hold on to their top billing.\n\nNadal, Djokovic and Federer have shared the last 12 Grand Slam titles between them, and going further back, the trio have claimed 55 of the last 66 Grand Slams, dating back to 2003.\n\nAlso on rt.com Forget picking sides in the Federer-Nadal-Djokovic debate, just sit back and revel in the brilliance\n\nOthers from the \u2018Next Gen\u2019 have previously hinted at breaking the ruling trio, including Medvedev\u2019s opponent on Sunday in Shanghai, the 22-year-old Zverev.\n\nThe German won the season-ending ATP Finals in London last year, later breaking into the world\u2019s top three, but has fallen away since the middle of the year and did not go beyond the quarterfinal of any of this year\u2019s Grand Slams.\n\nMedvedev\u2019s own surge has not been without bumps \u2013 note his row with the crowd at the US Open \u2013 but he has now moved firmly ahead of Zverev and other youngsters such as Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece to emerge as the number one threat to the established order.\n\n\u201cHe is the probably best player in the world right now,\u201d Zverev said this weekend, while a tweet from an official ATP account announcing his victory in Shanghai proclaimed him \"unstoppable.\"\n\nMedvedev is increasingly finding a will and a way to win, whatever the circumstances. Earlier this season, Tsitsipas summed up just how difficult it is to play against him, describing him as having \u201ca very weird game\u2026 sloppy, but a good sloppy.\n\n\u201cHe has this completely different way of playing, flat and low, without giving you much angle to work with,\" the Greek said.\n\n\"It can be very disturbing to play against him. He can make you miss without understanding why you missed.\u201d\n\nMedvedev himself has said that he doesn\u2019t \u201chave one shot that is amazing. I serve not bad, but I don\u2019t serve more than 130 (mph). It\u2019s just the consistency of everything. My tactic is to make my opponent suffer.\u201d\n\nAnd suffer they have.\n\nMoving into the top three of the ATP rankings will be a tough nut to crack, and pulling off a maiden Grand Slam title next year an even tougher one.\n\nBut Medvedev\u2019s continued brilliance indicates that he is the man leading the charge from the young brigade \u2013 and it will be increasingly hard for Nadal, Djokovic and Federer to repel him.", "description": "After winning the Shanghai Masters on Sunday, Daniil Medvedev told the crowd that he was giving them \u201csomething new.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da3300785f540207a72d917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
