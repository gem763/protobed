If he loved her he\u2019d be here already,\" snapped Sonia.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, Martin had already made his shock return back to the Square.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHooded Martin tried to remain undetected as he prowled around the streets trying to keep himself unnoticed.\n\nHe looked seething as he stared at Ben Mitchell, who knows that Stacy is responsible for whacking Phil over the head with a spanner.\n\nWill Martin risk being rumbled to see his daughter in hospital?\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nEastEnders viewers took to Twitter after discovering Martin was back in Albert Square.\n\n\"Oooooh Martin is back,\" said one intrigued viewer.\n\nAnother added: \"Martin looked so evil toward Ben, which means trouble is brewing..

I thought iI was doing the right thing. I let her down. I'm her mum. I'm supposed to be the one she trusts.
