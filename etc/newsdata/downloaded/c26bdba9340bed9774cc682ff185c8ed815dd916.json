So we asked a few piano teachers for their advice and insights for parents who are introducing their kids to the piano for the first time.\n\nWait until they can read\n\n\u201cBefore a child can actually read words, it\u2019s harder to teach them to read music,\u201d says Linda Filcek, a piano teacher in Mattawan, Michigan. \u201cSo I encourage parents to wait until their child is a reader before they start piano lessons.\u201d\n\nFor most kids, that\u2019s first or second grade. You can start them sooner, Filcek adds, but you\u2019ll get \u201cmore bang for your buck\u201d if you wait, because by six or seven years old, their hands are bigger and their fine motor skills are more developed, too.\n\nIf your younger child is begging for lessons, though, it\u2019s ok to start sooner, says Barteck, who teaches piano in Cincinnati, Ohio. But \u201cthe teacher needs to understand that a four-year-old isn\u2019t going to sit at the bench for half an hour.\u201d When Barteck teaches very young kids, she offers a twenty-minute lesson and gets the kids up and moving, clapping and stomping out quarter notes with their feet.\n\nShop around for the right teacher\n\nFinding the right teacher can play a huge role in your child\u2019s success, so it\u2019s worth taking the time to find one with a personality and style that works for your kid. Ask other parents for recommendations. Call up a local music store and ask which teacher would be the best match for your child\u2019s age, experience and personality. Set up lessons with a teacher for a few weeks, sit in on the lessons, and see how it goes.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say, \u2018We\u2019re trying YOU out,\u2019 but just say, \u2018We\u2019re giving lessons a try, and we\u2019d like to try a month of lessons to see how it goes,\u2019\u201d Barteck says.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t assume anything based on the teacher\u2019s resume. That acclaimed pianist with intimidating music degrees may be surprisingly terrific with young children; the sweet old lady from church might not have as much patience for little kids as you think. Give them both a try and see.\n\nBe supportive, but stay out of the way\n\n\u201cIf your kid is the kind where you hear a couple of plinks and then total silence and you have to yell up the hall \u2014 \u2018Keep practicing! Turn off the TV!\u2019 \u2014 find a way to be in the room while they\u2019re practicing,\u201d says Barteck.\n\nBring a book in, fold laundry or read something on your phone, \u201cso that you\u2019re not staring at them, but you\u2019re there.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudents, especially beginners, need to feel listened to,\u201d says Scott Besser, a piano teacher in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. \u201cStudents whose parents lend an interested ear or are physically present in the room are more likely to progress with greater success\u201d than those whose parents are simply nagging them daily to practice.\n\nAs for lessons, it\u2019s probably ok for parents sit in\u2014as long as they stay quiet.\n\n\u201cSeven out of ten times, it\u2019s a great idea to sit in on your kid\u2019s lesson because you\u2019re going to hear what they should be working on,\u201d Barteck says. Don\u2019t go in if it causes your child more stress, however, or if you find you\u2019re becoming a distraction.\n\nKeep your expectations in check\n\nAs for recital day, realise that it\u2019s not just a performance, it\u2019s also a learning experience. \u201cRecitals are actually my best teaching tool,\u201d says Filcek. \u201cMy students will really practice for a recital, and really get a song down.\u201d\n\nParents can help their children defuse nerves by holding \u201cliving room concerts\u201d at home, where the child practices walking in, introducing herself, and performing the recital piece for the family just as she will in the performance.\n\nAs a parent, it\u2019s important to remember that no teacher is going to have your child playing \u201cPiano Man\u201d after the first three lessons\u2014and that\u2019s ok. \u201cParents need to understand the time commitment needed\u2014that it will be a little while and a lot of work before your kid will be able to sit down and play whatever they want,\u201d says Kelsey Reed, a piano teacher in Seattle.\n\nThe result will be worth it, but like any new skill, it\u2019s going to take time.", "description": "When she was little, Hannah Barteck had the same bedtime routine as every other in kid in America, but with a twist: Every night, she\u2019d brush her teeth, wash her face, put on her pajamas \u2014 and then plunk herself down at the piano to practice....", "authors": ["Alan Henry", "Tooran Alizadeh"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wf2rk8ir5yv2bi3gore9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
