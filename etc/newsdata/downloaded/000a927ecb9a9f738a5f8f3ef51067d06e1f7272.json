We can quantify the importance of each swing via Championship Probability Added, a metric created by baseball analyst Sky Andrecheck that measures how much a particular play influences a team\u2019s chances to win the World Series. For example, Strasburg\u2019s strikeout ofDodgers first baseman Matt Beaty in the bottom of the sixth inning of Game 5 of the NLDS improved Washington\u2019s World Series chances by about one-half of one percent. On the other hand, his pitch to shortstop Corey Seager in the bottom of the first inning of the same game, causing Seager to hit into a double play, improved the Nationals\u2019 World Series chances by 1.4 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s not bad, but still not valuable enough to crack this list of the 10 postseason plays that pushed the Nats to the World Series. The plays are listed here, starting with the at-bat that most improved Washington\u2019s World Series hopes.\n\n1) Juan Soto\u2019s three-run single off Josh Hader in the NL wild-card game\n\nSituation: Bottom of the eighth, two outs, bases loaded\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 7.3 percent, per the Baseball Gauge\n\nSoto batted .282 with 34 home runs during the regular season, so it\u2019s no surprise he came up big for Washington in the winner-take-all playoff game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Soto\u2019s only hit of the game was a line-drive single to right field off Hader\u2019s high four-seam fastball, allowing Michael A. Taylor, Andrew Stevenson and then Rendon to score after Trent Grisham\u2019s error. Soto would be thrown out while celebrating on the base paths, but no one seemed to care. It remains the single-most important at-bat of this Nats postseason run.\n\n2) Anthony Rendon\u2019s double to center field off Joe Kelly in Game 5 of the NLDS\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSituation: top of the 10th, no outs, man on first\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 6.3 percent\n\nHeading into the playoffs, Rendon was 1 for 3 against Kelly for his career, but his ground-rule double against Kelly\u2019s knuckle curve sent Adam Eaton from first to third, setting the stage for a monstrous at-bat from Howie Kendrick just a few pitches later. (This play ranks higher, because Rendon\u2019s hit put the Nationals in prime position to take the lead in this deciding game, whether or not Kendrick reached safely.)\n\n3) Juan Soto\u2019s home run off Clayton Kershaw in Game 5 of the NLDS\n\nSituation: top of the eighth, no outs, no men on base\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 5.7 percent\n\nAD\n\nKershaw, a three-time Cy Young winner and former MVP, was brought in as a reliever to face the Nationals\u2019 3-4-5 hitters in the top of the eighth inning, with the Dodgers up by two runs. Soto, the second batter of the inning, crushed a 449-foot bomb that put Kershaw\u2019s slider into the seats, tying the game at 3.\n\nAD\n\nClayton Kershaw has allowed 28 homers to left-handed hitters since Statcast started tracking in 2015. Juan Soto's 110.0 mph, 449-foot game-tying shot is both the hardest-hit and the longest of the 28. pic.twitter.com/h6XINfOHfI \u2014 David Adler (@_dadler) October 10, 2019\n\n4) Howie Kendrick\u2019s grand slam off Joe Kelly in Game 5 of the NLDS\n\nSituation: top of the 10th, no outs, bases loaded\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 4.0 percent\n\nKendrick has 125 home runs over his 14-year career, but before this month, just one \u2014 a walk-off home run against Albert Suarez in 2017 \u2014 was a grand slam. Kendrick\u2019s second career grand slam came at the expense of a Kelly fastball that drifted too far into Kendrick\u2019s power zone. Ironically, it was the weakest home run measured by exit velocity (105 mph) hit by Kendrick this year, in either the regular season or playoffs. Again, Nats fans didn\u2019t seem to mind.\n\nAD\n\n5) Anthony Rendon\u2019s home run off Clayton Kershaw in Game 5 of the NLDS\n\nSituation: top of the eighth, no outs, no men on base\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 2.8 percent\n\nKershaw, of course, didn\u2019t just get touched by Soto. He gave up back-to-back home runs in relief during Game 5, and the first came off the bat of Rendon, a 381-foot shot to center field that drew the Nats within a run of the Dodgers. Normally Kershaw goes with his slider when behind in the count to a right-handed batter (57 percent of the time in 2019), but Kershaw instead stuck with his fastball on this 1-0 pitch and paid the price.\n\nAD\n\n6) Adam Eaton\u2019s two-run double off Adam Wainwright in Game 2 of the NLCS\n\nAD\n\nSituation: top of the eighth, one out, men on first and second\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 2.6 percent\n\nWainwright allowed an above-average rate of extra-base hits this season (35 percent, compared to 31 percent for MLB pitchers as a whole) and Eaton took advantage of Wainwright\u2019s curveball on a full count, hitting a scorching double to right field. The two-base knock scored Matt Adams and Trea Turner, putting the Nats up 3-0. It also improved Washington\u2019s chances to win this game from 76 to 93 percent, making it the biggest hit of the night, and possibly of the championship series.\n\nThe best part of the hit might have been the thought process Eaton went through at the plate. According to The Post\u2019s Sam Fortier, Eaton channeled George Costanza, the sitcom character from \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d and disregarded his instincts. Instead of sitting on a fastball \u2014 Eaton\u2019s first guess at the next pitch \u2014 he instead positioned himself to take advantage of a curve.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cGeorge was right.\u201d\n\n7) Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s three-run home run off Pedro Baez in Game 4 of the NLDS\n\nSituation: bottom of the fifth, two outs, men on first and third\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 2.3 percent\n\nZimmerman has 100 postseason plate appearances. Only one, a three-run home run against Mike Montgomery in Game 5 of the 2017 NLDS against the Chicago Cubs, was more important than the at-bat against Baez in Game 4 of this year\u2019s NLDS.\n\nZimmerman took Baez deep to right field, giving Washington a 5-1 lead over the Dodgers and sending Nationals Park into histrionics. It was only the fourth home run hit by Zimmerman in the playoffs but it would also be his longest and hardest ever in the postseason, a 414-foot rocket hit at 107.2 mph. And it helped ensure that the series would go back to L.A. for Game 5.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n8) Howie Kendrick\u2019s single off John Brebbia in Game 1 of the NLCS\n\nSituation: top of the seventh, two outs, men on first and third\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 2.0 percent\n\nKendrick had two hits in the opening game of the NLCS: a double off Miles Mikolas in the top of the second inning and a single off Brebbia in the seventh inning. The latter scored Eaton and moved Rendon from first to second, upping Washington\u2019s lead to 2-0, a margin that would hold for the remainder of the game.\n\n9) Juan Soto\u2019s two-run home run off Hyun-jin Ryu in Game 3 of the NLDS\n\nSituation: bottom of the first, two outs, man on first\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 2.0 percent\n\nAD\n\nRyu led the majors with a 2.32 ERA during the regular season and only allowed two earned runs over five innings in Game 3 of the NLDS. Both were to Soto off a 91 mph fastball, a pitch Ryu threw 772 times this season, including the playoffs. Before that meeting with Soto, Ryu had yielded just five home runs off his fastball in 2019. (This is the only play on this list that came in a loss.)\n\nAD\n\nHyun-Jin Ryu allowed one run in 14 2/3 regular-season innings against the Nationals this year. He allowed two of them in his first postseason inning against them, on a Juan Soto blast that traveled 408 feet to dead center. \u2014 Alden Gonzalez (@Alden_Gonzalez) October 7, 2019\n\n10) Max Scherzer gets Yadier Molina to hit into a double play in Game 2 of the NLCS\n\nSituation: bottom of the seventh, one out, man on first\n\nChampionship Probability Added: 1.9 percent\n\nScherzer dominated the Cardinals in Game 2, pitching seven shutout innings of one-hit ball with 11 strikeouts, joining Mike Mussina (1997 American League Championship Series), Orlando Hernandez (1999 World Series), Roger Clemens (2000 ALCS) and Homer Bailey (2012 NLDS) as the only postseason pitchers to pitch seven or more innings with just one hit against and at least 10 strikeouts.\n\nThe biggest pitch of the night was a 0-1 fastball low and outside to Molina, inducing a ground out to Turner, who turned the double play. Ground outs off Scherzer\u2019s four-seam fastball had been rare \u2014 only 2.1 percent of his four-seamers resulted in routine grounders this year. His career low groundball rate on his fastball is 1.9 percent, set in 2012 and 2017, per Statcast data. It was also only the fourth time Scherzer induced a playoff double play since he joined the Nationals in 2015.\n\nAD", "description": "These were Washington\u2019s biggest postseason moments, according to a metric that measures how much a particular play influences a team\u2019s chances to win the World Series.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rsbAUWPvEe6kk7tZusejlWi-ZOY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RHDAG42INEP3IZC2ONE5LOQLM", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
