After Reyes landed a few more punches to the head, referee Herb Dean stopped the fight at 1:43.\n\n\u201cI just felt loose,\u201d the 29-year-old Reyes said. \u201cI was enjoying the fight. I saw him lunging in and I cracked him. I could tell he was hurt.\u201d\n\nReyes, from Victorville, California, entered the fight ranked fourth in the UFC\u2019s light heavyweight division.\n\nIt was the fifth loss in the last six fights for the 35-year-old Weidman, of Baldwinville, New York. It also was his first fight as a light heavyweight. He entered as the UFC\u2019s sixth-ranked middleweight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sit down and talk,\u201d UFC president Dana White said. \u201cHe was moving up to light heavyweight and it didn\u2019t work out. Maybe he\u2019ll go back down to middleweight or consider retirement.\u201d\n\nAfter the fight, Reyes called out UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones.\n\n\u201cJon, I want that belt,\u201d Reyes said.\n\nIn the co-main event, Yair Rodriguez won his rematch against Jeremy Stephens in a three-round featherweight bout, posting a unanimous decision. All three judges scored it 29-28. Rodriguez, a Mexican now living in Chicago, improved to 13-2 with one no-contest. Stephens, of San Diego, dropped to 28-17 with one contest.\n\nStephens controlled the third round, taking Rodriguez down twice and keeping him on the mat for the final three minutes.\n\nMidway through the second round, Rodriguez took down Stephens and landed several punches to the head before Stephens reversed the situation and eventually stood up. In the final minute of the second, Stephens took down Rodriguez and landed two uppercuts while controlling his opponent from behind.\n\nStephens and Rodriguez fought on Sept. 21 in Mexico City. Fifteen seconds into the fight, Rodriguez swatted Stephens in the left eye and Stephens could not continue, making the bout a no-contest.\n\nFormer NFL All-Pro defensive end Greg Hardy\u2019s unanimous-decision victory over Ben Sosoli at heavyweight was changed to a no-contest by the Massachusetts State Athletic Commission because Hardy used an asthma inhaler between rounds.\n\n\u201cI asked permission and was told I could use it,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inhaler I\u2019ve used my entire life. I never used it during a fight. That\u2019s why I asked permission.\u201d\n\nSaid White: \u201cHe asked the (Massachusetts commission) inspector if he could use it. The inspector asked if it was medically approved. He said it was USADA-approved (U.S. Anti-Doping Agency). But all you can have during the fight is water.\u201d\n\nAll three judges scored the bout 39-37. Hardy, who played for the Carolina Panthers and Dallas Cowboys, is now 3-1 with one no-contest. Sosoli dropped to 7-2 with two no-contests.\n\nBoth fighters stayed on their feet for almost the entire fight except for when Hardy briefly sent Sosoli to the mat with a leg kick in the final 90 seconds.\n\nIn other bouts on the main card, Darren Stewart won a split decision against Deron Winn at middleweight. Female flyweight Maycee Barber stopped Gillian Robertson by TKO in the first round and Joe Lauzon, of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, scored a TKO victory over Jonathan Pearce of Phoenix in a lightweight contest.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dominick Reyes remained undefeated in 12 fights, stopping former UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman by technical knockout in the first round Friday night at UFC Fight Night at the TD Garden.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/ufc_boston_mixed_martial_arts_16738_c0-185-4437-2773_s1200x700.jpg?075e6a8572ea4f330bdd734a27886367605d7958", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
