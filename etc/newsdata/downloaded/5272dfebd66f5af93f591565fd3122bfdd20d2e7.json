An online mob slammed his \u2018white supremacist rhetoric,\u2019 and he lost his job.\n\nEarlier this month, Ascend, the high-performing Brooklyn charter-school network, fired its accomplished founder and CEO, Steven Wilson. What had Wilson done to deserve this? Not much.\n\nWilson, a school leader with decades of experience, a onetime senior fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, and the author of two books on school reform, became perhaps the most visible victim to date of charter schooling\u2019s worrisome turn to politically correct groupthink. Woke enough to declare that his life\u2019s purpose is \u201caddressing education inequalities,\u201d he nevertheless dared to talk frankly about third-rail questions of educational rigor and excellence, and paid the price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis past summer, on June 4, Wilson penned a blog post titled, \u201cThe promise of intellectual joy\u201d that appeared on Ascend\u2019s website. Wilson argued that \u201cdemocratic\u201d education must strive to \u201cgrant all students the knowledge and faculties of mind that had once only been afforded the elite.\u201d He lamented that intellectual pursuit is today too often seen not as a democratic birthright, but as an elitist affectation.\n\nWilson fretted that values such as \u201cobjectivity\u201d and \u201cworship of the written word\u201d had been dismissed as \u201cdamaging characteristics of white supremacy culture.\u201d He said there was a \u201cgrowing risk\u201d that efforts to make schools more \u201cdiverse, equitable, and inclusive\u201d could \u201cbe shamefully exploited to justify reduced intellectual expectations of students.\u201d Schools must find ways to make clear that \u201cintellectual pursuit\u201d and \u201cespecially intellectual joy\u201d are good for all students, of every race and background. If we fail to do that, Wilson argued, \u201cThe distinctly American project of equal opportunity will continue to be thwarted.\u201d\n\nOne might find all this all to be anodyne enough. Yet, in the progressive-driven culture war that has consumed charter schooling, Wilson\u2019s lofty sentiments were grounds for angry attacks. Soon after the post appeared, a group that labeled itself \u201cFriends of Ascend\u201d started a petition on Change.org that sought to \u201chold the CEO of Ascend Public Charter Schools accountable for white supremacist rhetoric.\u201d The petition insisted that Wilson\u2019s post contained \u201coffensive and oppressive content that . . . propagates destructive messages about the community that Ascend serves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months after the petition surfaced, Ascend\u2019s board reviewed Wilson\u2019s \u201crecord,\u201d and he was fired.\n\nThe petition writers worked hard to call out Wilson\u2019s wrongthink. They took issue, for instance, with his assertion that, in the 1970s and 1980s, \u201ccivil rights activists were concerned that requiring students of color to undertake demanding academic work would discriminate against children already harmed by prejudicial treatment in other aspects of their lives.\u201d They denounced him for offering \u201cunfounded and inaccurate representations of civil rights history\u201d that are \u201chistorically inaccurate and negate the work of civil rights leaders did [sic] to fight for a high-quality education for ALL students.\u201d While Wilson\u2019s characterization of the matter was probably too sweeping, its underlying sentiment is hard to argue with. Of course, some civil-rights leaders of the 1970s and 1980s in some venues thought just as Wilson claimed they did, and it was unremarkable for him to note that the civil-rights push in schooling was marked by compromises, uncertainty, and decisions that can today be second-guessed. These observations do not \u201cnegate\u201d the work of civil-rights leaders; they merely acknowledge reality.\n\nThe attack on Wilson\u2019s supposedly \u201cwhite supremacist rhetoric\u201d is particularly striking given his outspoken commitment to addressing civil-rights concerns in the past \u2014 specifically in the case of school discipline. When, last decade, the school-reform community evinced an unshakable certainty that strict discipline was a crucial element of school success, Ascend was right there. In recent years, as the consensus swiftly pivoted to an embrace of \u201crestorative justice\u201d and an insistence that strict discipline was misguided and racist, Ascend adjusted its policies accordingly. Wilson was ahead of the curve on this, observing in 2016 that Ascend had \u201cmoved sharply away from a zero tolerance discipline approach.\u201d If anything, for good or ill, Wilson has been a leader of efforts to recalibrate school discipline in response to concerns about racial disparities. It\u2019s simply untrue to suggest that Wilson has ever shown indifference to civil-rights concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson\u2019s plight has been greeted with a remarkable, disconcerting silence in the larger charter-school world (broken only by one lonely response). While we have heard a number of whispered laments, almost no one has objected publicly, and it\u2019s not clear why. After all, Wilson\u2019s points were eminently defensible on their merits. What exactly did he do wrong? Influential scholars and pundits have indeed dismissed \u201cobjectivity\u201d and \u201cworship of the written word\u201d as hallmarks of \u201cwhite supremacy culture.\u201d Wilson is right that efforts to promote inclusion and equity have indeed sometimes turned into excuses to lower expectations and reduce rigor. One can only surmise that Wilson\u2019s real sin was to raise these uncomfortable issues at all.\n\nMore important, even if one stipulates that portions of Wilson\u2019s high-minded essay were sure to spark dissent, the idea that such disagreement justifies censuring \u2014 much less firing \u2014 an accomplished school leader shows a frightening willingness to kowtow to the basest impulses of the mob. And that is a betrayal of fundamental principles. After all, inspiring energetic discussion of how schools can best serve their students isn\u2019t just healthy \u2014 it\u2019s a hallmark of quality schools and school leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharter schools lack the bureaucratic insulation of large, staid public-school systems. Charter-school leaders are more exposed and frequently more accessible to the communities they serve. This exposure can be a powerful force for good. But there\u2019s also the question of whether it may yield a sector whose leaders are inclined to crumple in the face of concentrated pressure and social-media outrage. Will charter schools be willing or able to stand against the groupthink of the moment in future cases where bedrock educational principles are at stake? For a sector that has been defined by bold, innovative leadership, the answer will prove telling.\n\nFrederick M.
