They were able to do this only because most Democrats were absent, some of them attending commemorative events; the Democratic leader had advised members that they didn\u2019t need to be present because, he says, he was assured there would be no votes that morning.\n\nItem: Also last week, Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a subpoena to the acting director of national intelligence, who has refused to turn over a whistle-blower complaint that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general found credible and of \u201curgent concern.\u201d We don\u2019t know what the whistle-blower was warning about, but we do know that the law is clear: Such complaints must be referred to Congress, no exceptions allowed.\n\nOn the surface, these stories may seem to be about very different things. The fight in North Carolina is basically about the G.O.P.\u2019s determination to deny health care to low-income Americans; the governor had threatened to veto any budget that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid. The whistle-blower affair probably involves malfeasance by high government officials, quite possibly President Trump, that in some way threatens national security.\n\nWhat the stories have in common, however, is that they illustrate contempt for democracy and constitutional government. Elections are supposed to have consequences, conveying power to the winners. But when Democrats win an election, the modern G.O.P. does its best to negate the results, flouting norms and, if necessary, the law to carry on as if the voters hadn\u2019t spoken.", "description": "Do Democrats understand what they\u2019re facing?", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/opinion/16krugmanWeb/16krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
