(AP) - The Oglala Sioux Tribal Council has banned the sale, possession and use of e-cigarettes on the Pine Ridge Reservation amid a nationwide outbreak of vaping-related illnesses.\n\nThe tribal council approved the ban last week, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported Monday. The maximum penalty for violating the ordinance is a fine of $250 or 30 days in jail.\n\n\u201cThe health of our people, including our youth, is of the utmost importance and our tribe has always strived to take a leading role in addressing the health issues of our people,\u201d the ordinance states.\n\nThere have been six confirmed cases of vaping-related illness in South Dakota, according to the South Dakota Department of Health, and over 800 across the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with 12 confirmed deaths in other states.\n\nThe CDC says most of the patients reported using products containing THC, the chemical that produces marijuana\u2019s high, or both THC-containing products and nicotine-containing products. Some patients reported using only nicotine-containing products. The CDC recommends refraining from using vaping products, particularly those containing THC, while the investigation is ongoing, and against buying these products off the street.\n\nTribal President Julian Bear Runner heralded the vaping ban as a \u201cbold action\u201d and used the occasion to call for further action to regulate all forms of tobacco and nicotine on the reservation.\n\n\u201cIn the near future it would empower us to adopt additional legislation related to the cultivation and sale of all forms of tobacco and nicotine, as those industries have profited from our misery since we can remember,\u201d Bear Runner said in a statement. \u201cIt is to our benefit to authorize only tobacco the Oglala Sioux Tribe has sanctioned.\u201d\n\nThe Pine Ridge Reservation has a population of roughly 20,000 in southwestern South Dakota.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Argus Leader, http://www.argusleader.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Oglala Sioux Tribal Council has banned the sale, possession and use of e-cigarettes on the Pine Ridge Reservation amid a nationwide outbreak of vaping-related illnesses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
