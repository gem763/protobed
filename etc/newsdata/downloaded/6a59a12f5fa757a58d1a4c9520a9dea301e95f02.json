A new survey now finds that the majority of them think life will end on Earth in a decade or so.\n\nWhat about everybody else? The end is not necessarily near.\n\n\u201cOver the next 10-15 years, 29% of all voters believe it is at least somewhat likely that the earth will become uninhabitable and humanity will be wiped out,\u201d says a timely new Scott Rasmussen/HarrisX national survey.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that 71% overall disagree with this finding and say Armageddon is an unlikely prospect.\n\n\u201cThere is a dramatic difference by age on this question. Half (51%) of voters under 35 believe it is at least somewhat likely humanity will be wiped out in the next decade or so. Only 12% of senior citizens agree, and only 4% of senior citizens believe it is very likely,\u201d the survey said.\n\nThe data also revealed a significant geographical divide: 21% of urban voters consider it very likely the earth will quickly become uninhabitable, compared to 6% of rural voters and 5% of suburban voters. The poll of 1,000 registered U.S. voters was conducted Sept. 11-12 and released Monday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
