Their replacement front row forced a penalty and the scrum before the lineout maul won another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe icing was put on the cake by Watson as time ran out and there was one final humiliation as Koroibete streaked away to score what he thought was a late consolation, only for referee Jerome Garces to rule it out for a forward pass. England will take on either Ireland or New Zealand in the semi-final.", "description": "Jonny May celebrated his 50th England cap with two tries as England booked their place in a first Rugby World Cup semi-final since 2007, beating Australia 40-16 in Oita.
