All three states have a Senate race with a somewhat vulnerable incumbent GOP senator up for reelection (Martha McSally (Ariz.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), and Richard Burr (N.C.)).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement of this advertising campaign \u2014 while wholly unsurprising given Planned Parenthood\u2019s past record of expending millions of dollars to assist Democratic candidates every election cycle \u2014 offers an occasion to recall that the group is not merely an anodyne women\u2019s health-care provider, as its executives and defenders routinely insist.\n\nIt was a disagreement over political strategy, after all, that got Leana Wen ousted from her job as Planned Parenthood\u2019s CEO this summer. Wen, a physician who served most recently as health commissioner in Baltimore, had been under the impression that Planned Parenthood had hired her to expand its health-care footprint, not lead a political-action campaign in support of the Democratic party. The group\u2019s board evidently had other ideas.\n\nEven aside from the stark reality that abortion isn\u2019t health care (\u201chealth care\u201d is traditionally understood as an effort to heal rather than to kill), it isn\u2019t difficult to discern that our nation\u2019s supposedly benevolent chain of women\u2019s-health clinics is in fact committed primarily to protecting and expanding its ability to perform a procedure that plumps up the bottom line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis aggressive political-spending effort to unseat politicians who would remove Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual half a billion in federal funding and undertake further efforts to protect unborn human life is just the latest example.", "description": "The organization has announced a $45 million political-action campaign to unseat Trump and vulnerable Senate Republicans.", "authors": ["Alexandra Desanctis", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
