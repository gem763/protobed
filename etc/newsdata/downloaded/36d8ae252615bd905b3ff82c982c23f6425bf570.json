I\u2019m so hopeful that one day they will do it. But it\u2019s not going to happen for 2020, forget it. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The other one is Led Zeppelin. People keep coming up to me again and saying \u201cIs it true?\u201d Let\u2019s clear that up now. I do not think that is going to happen.\u2019\n\nFleetwood Mac found fame in the 1970s (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAfter a sell-out world tour in 2019, sources close to the band have claimed that several members of the group did not believe the money on the table from the festival was \u2018worthwhile\u2019.\n\n\u2018Michael is a huge fan and really, really wanted to make it work. He knew getting them on board for the 50th anniversary would be extra special and conversations were positive,\u2019 a source close to the festival alleged.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun, the insider added: \u2018But ultimately, while Mick Fleetwood was up for it with the money on offer, other members didn\u2019t feel it was worthwhile.\u2019\n\nGlastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary festival will take place at Worthy Farm from 24-28 June 2020.\n\nThe first batch of tickets for the festival, which included coach travel to the event, sold out in less than half an hour before the general admission tickets went on sale on Sunday morning.\n\nGlastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary festival will take place from 24-28 June 2020 (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhile the festival may be turning 50 in 2020, it only took place intermittently throughout the 70s before becoming an annual event in 1981.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then it has taken place most years although it takes a break every few years to allow the ground to recover from being trampled on by all those revellers.\n\nWill Taylor Swift hit the Pyramid Stage? (Picture: Getty)\n\nIn September Taylor released tour dates for her seventh album Lover tour \u2013 and there was a conveniently empty spot for both the Saturday and Sunday of Glastonbury Festival 2020.\n\nThe Shake It Off singer revealed dates for 2020 and shared with fans that she will be performing across various festivals, some of which she has curated herself.\n\n\u2018The Lover album is open fields, sunsets, + SUMMER. I want to perform it in a way that feels authentic. I want to go to some places I haven\u2019t been and play festivals. Where we didn\u2019t have festivals, we made some,\u2019 she shared on Twitter, adding: \u2018Introducing, Lover Fest East + West!\u2019\n\nThere are no UK dates yet but she will play Oslo on 26 June and Denmark on 1 July; Glastonbury 2020 will run 24 \u2013 28 June while other potential dates include London\u2019s BST Festival which in 2019 ran between 5 and 14 July.\n\nIn addition to Lover Fest West and Lover Fest East, her only U.S. concert dates in 2020, Taylor announces she will be headlining festivals and concerts in Europe and South America.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Fleetwood Mac for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
