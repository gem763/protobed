One official said Trump had won the right to collect a total of between \u20ac5 billion and \u20ac8 billion. Another said the maximum sum was close to $10 billion.\n\nThe decision sets the stage for a showdown between Europe and Washington just as the EU is transitioning to new leadership under incoming Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Trade Commissioner-designate Phil Hogan. In unveiling her team on Tuesday, von der Leyen signaled a robust approach to transatlantic disputes on trade and other issues with the Trump administration.\n\nWashington has previously announced it would follow through with tariffs if it won the case in Geneva and has prepared a list of EU exports worth a total of $21 billion. The U.S. can choose products from that list and then tax them at different rates in order to claw back the total amount of damage resulting from the EU subsidies. Washington has previously estimated the amount of damage resulting from EU subsidies that are still in place at $11 billion.\n\nWashington's tariffs in the Airbus case threaten to hit the company hard. The list of planned duties includes passenger aircraft.\n\nBoth parties now have a few weeks to add comments and delete any confidential business information before the ruling, by a WTO dispute settlement panel, is officially adopted and made public.\n\nThe ruling marks the culmination of a decades-long dispute on whether EU countries have illegally supported Airbus by granting subsidized loans known as \u201claunch aid\u201d and other advantages for the development of the A350 and A380 models. The U.S. first filed the complaint in Geneva against Airbus subsidies in 2006.\n\nHowever, a parallel complaint by the EU, alleging illegal U.S. subsidies for Boeing, is also being examined by the WTO. A ruling in that case is expected in about eight months, industry sources said.\n\nWashington's tariffs in the Airbus case threaten to hit the company hard. The list of planned duties includes passenger aircraft, which would make Airbus planes more expensive in the U.S. compared to its arch-rival Boeing.\n\nTo make matters worse for Airbus, the list also contains EU aircraft parts \u2014 a move that EU officials said was designed explicitly to disrupt the company's supply and manufacturing chain by depriving the company of the parts it needs for the final assembly of its A320 model in the U.S. state of Alabama.\n\nEU officials have warned the U.S. that such a move would end up destroying U.S. jobs.\n\nAirbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath declined to comment on the WTO ruling. \u201cThe WTO decision is neither public nor authorized for release. We do not comment on rumors on a report that is not public,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he warned that both the U.S. and Europe would lose from a tariff war. \"Nobody will win, it\u2019s a lose-lose for the whole industry if we move to tariffs,\" he said.\n\nThat hasn't discouraged the United States from charging ahead. U.S. officials have signaled they are ready to move quickly to impose tariffs.\n\nOne EU official described the U.S. approach as \"hit first, talk later.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission said Brussels would \u201cnot comment on leaks\u201d but has \u201ccommunicated to the United States that the European Union is ready to work on a fair and balanced solution for our respective aircraft industries.\u201d\n\nBrussels expects that its case against Boeing will give the bloc the right to retaliate with its own tariffs next year, and hopes to strike an agreement with Washington to simultaneously lift both sanctions.\n\n\u201cIn the parallel Boeing case, we are expecting the WTO decision on the European Union sanction rights in the coming months,\u201d the Commission spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe mutual imposition of sanctions is counterproductive and damaging to our respective economies \u2026 The EU has, as recently as July, submitted concrete proposals to the US to which there has been no reaction so far. The EU\u2019s willingness to find a fair settlement remains unchanged.\u201d\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
