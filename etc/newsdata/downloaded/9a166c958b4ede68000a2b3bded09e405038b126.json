In fact, he believes the first baby could be born in space within just 12 years.\n\nDr Egbert Edelbroek, founder and chief executive of SpaceBorn United, said the company is designing missions where pregnant women can give birth in orbit.\n\nThe aim is not currently for the whole pregnancy to take place in space, but instead a 24- to 36-hour mission for the labour.\n\nSpeaking at the first Space and Science Congress of Asgardia the Space Nation in Darmstadt, Germany, Dr Edelbroek said he thought this would happen by 2031.\n\n\u2018This is only possible, for now, in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO), and it is only possible thanks to a very thorough selection procedure,\u2019 he said. The congress heard some of the requirements for participant expectant mothers, and medical staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese would include having experience of two flawless previous deliveries, and a high natural radiation resistance.\n\nAn artist\u2019s impression of what Asgardia could look like (Picture: James Vaughan/Asgardia)\n\nDr Edelbroek said: \u2018You can induce the labour process like they do in IVF clinics on a daily basis. Planning is, of course, an issue \u2013 it is hard to plan a natural process like this if there is something wrong with the weather, or a delay with the launch.\n\n\u2018We could never work with just one pregnant woman. We would have maybe 30 participants and they could step out at any moment. But the experts that we work with, they believe, and I believe, that this is possible at a lower risk level than an average Western-style delivery on Earth.\n\n\u2018That would be the only way to make this possible.\u2019\n\nHe added that, while he thought this was possible, he was not planning for it, with the company\u2019s work focusing on embryo development and conception in space.\n\nSpaceBorn Utd researches conditions for human reproduction in space, and is focused on Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). Asked about the 12-year estimate, Dr Edelbroek said it would depend on funding and developments in the space tourism sector.\n\n\u2018If that sector is going to accelerate in the way it\u2019s doing right now, there will be markets for very wealthy people who aren\u2019t prepared to do three months\u2019 military training, happy to go as they are,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018And there will be spacecraft that are very comfortable for those people. It depends on the risk you are willing to take.\u2019", "description": "One company is designing missions for women to give birth in orbit", "authors": ["Metro Science Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89947991_1571214645.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
