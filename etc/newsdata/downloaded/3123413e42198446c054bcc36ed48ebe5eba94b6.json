Take a look at our federal prisons,\u201d Trump said as he gestured Acosta to hurry up with his longwinded question.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say to critics who say that you are creating a national emergency? That you\u2019re concocting a national emergency here to get your wall,\u201d Acosta said.\n\nCNN\u2019S JIM ACOSTA MOCKED FOR ACCIDENTALLY PROVING THAT BORDER WALLS WORK\n\nTrump pointed to angel moms in attendance, asking them for their thoughts.\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m creating something? Ask these incredible women who lost their daughters and their sons,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOK, Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda. You\u2019re CNN. You\u2019re fake news.\u201d\n\nTrump told Acosta the statistics he provided were \u201cwrong\u201d and told him to take a look at the federal prison population for proof.\n\n\u201cSee how many of them,percentage-wise, are illegal aliens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cJust see, go ahead and see. It\u2019s a fake question.\u201d\n\nAcosta was subsequently confronted by the angel moms in attendance, after the press conference. As angel moms confronted the CNN reporter, he invited them to appear on the network in the background of a live shot.\n\n\u201cThere is no attempt whatsoever to diminish what they\u2019ve gone through, or take away what they\u2019ve gone through, but as you heard in that question that I had with the president \u2026 it was really about the facts and the data,\u201d Acosta said on CNN following his exchange with Trump. \u201cSome of these folks came up to me right after this press conference \u2026 they\u2019re holding up these pictures of loved ones who lost their lives.\u201d\n\nAn angel mom then discussed that a previously deported illegal alien murdered her son.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is completely correct on this issue, we need to protect this country,\u201d the angel mom told Acosta.\n\nBefore Acosta\u2019s questioning, Trump said he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall even as he plans to sign a funding package that includes just $1.4 billion for border security.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS CNN\u2019S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: \u2018YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border \u2026 one way or the other, we have to do it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe move is expected to face a swift and forceful legal challenge that could stall the attempt in the courts for the near future. But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to continue to fight for border wall construction while also averting another partial government shutdown -- which would have been triggered at midnight absent the new funding package.\n\nIronically, Acosta accidently supported Trump\u2019s argument that walls work during a widely mocked selfie-style video last month.\n\nAcosta wasn\u2019t the only reporter who was reprimanded by the president during the Rose Garden event, as Trump angrily told another member of the media to \u201csit down\u201d after a question about where he receives his information.\n\nMEDIA ACKNOWLEDGED \u2018EPIC\u2019 BORDER CRISIS UNDER OBAMA \u2013 WHAT CHANGED?\n\nLast year, Acosta was briefly banned from the White House after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a Nov. 7 press conference. During the now-infamous moment, Acosta refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide.\n\nAcosta\u2019s press pass was restored on Nov. 19 after CNN argued that keeping him out of the White House violated the network and Acosta\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nTo coincide with Acosta being allowed to return to the White House, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders implemented a series of rules to govern White House press conferences going forward. The CNN reporter has been praised by liberal comedians such as Jimmy Kimmel, and even appeared in the most recent season of the Netflix political drama \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman and John Roberts contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump scolded CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Friday during the president's\u00a0Rose Garden announcement that he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, telling the reporter he has \u201can agenda\u201d -- before angel moms in attendance confronted the chief CNN White House correspondent.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
