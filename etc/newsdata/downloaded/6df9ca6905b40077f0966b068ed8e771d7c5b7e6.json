His impeachment is imperative | Robert Reich Read more\n\nGiuliani, the former mayor of New York who is deeply implicated in Trump\u2019s efforts to solicit the help of the Ukraine government in his 2020 re-election bid, gave a rambling interview to ABC\u2019s This Week that saw him frantically waving what he said were affidavits from Ukraine prosecutors.\n\nGiuliani, who also appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, also attacked the anonymous whistleblower at the center of the impeachment process and the Democrats leading it.\n\nOn ABC, Giuliani denied that he had set out, at the president\u2019s behest, to mine for dirt in Ukraine on Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not investigating Joe Biden,\u201d he said, \u201cI fell on Joe Biden in investigating how the Ukrainians were conspiring with the Hillary Clinton campaign to turn over dirty information.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, the Daily Beast reported that Biden\u2019s campaign chiefs had taken the unusual step of writing to news networks to ask them to no longer book Giuliani, who they said \u201chas demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative\u201d.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter on Sunday night, stepping up his attack on the whistleblower who made the complaint over his phone call with the Ukrainian president. Trump accused the whistleblower of representing a \u201cperfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way\u201d. Trump also demanded that he be able to meet the whistleblower: \u201cWas this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe president also hit out at Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chair at the forefront of the impeachment inquiry, tweeting that he should be \u201cquestioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason\u201d.\n\nEarlier Schiff had told ABC that party leaders were \u201cbringing a real sense of urgency\u201d to the inquiry. He indicated that Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community who alerted Congress to an \u201curgent concern\u201d in the whistleblower complaint, would be called to testify in private. Schiff and other Democrats hope that will allow Atkinson to hand over names of key White House witnesses.\n\nTwo diplomats are also likely to be called to testify this week: Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine who resigned on Friday, and Marie Yovanovitch, who was pulled from her post as ambassador in Kyiv last May in what was widely seen as a political hit job.\n\nAt the core of the impeachment battle is Trump\u2019s push to coerce the Ukraine government to investigate conspiracy theories relating to top Democrats. According to the nine-page complaint filed by the whistleblower, an unidentified member of the intelligence services, \u201cthe president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election\u201d.\n\nTrump is accused of seeking dirt that would show that Biden acted corruptly in 2016 in his role as vice-president by pressuring Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor. According to the Trump narrative, the prosecutor was targeted because he was investigating a Ukrainian company on whose board sat Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nIn fact, Biden was one of many European and western leaders who wanted the prosecutor gone because he was failing to tackle corruption. Former chief prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko repeated to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday his view that no wrongdoing by either Biden has been found.\n\nOne of the most highly charged decisions facing Democrats will be whether to call Giuliani to testify. Asked by ABC if he would appear, Giuliani said he would \u201cconsider\u201d it, but only if Schiff were removed.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t cooperate with Adam Schiff,\u201d the former mayor said. \u201cI think Adam Schiff should be removed. If they remove Adam Schiff, if they put a neutral person who hasn\u2019t prejudged the case\u2026\u201d\n\nSchiff said the decision on Giuliani would be made \u201cdown the road\u201d.\n\nGiuliani reserved his harshest words for the whistleblower and Biden. The \u201cso-called whistleblower\u201d, a denigrating description that has become a Trump staple, had he claimed said \u201cfive things that were totally false. I\u2019m not saying he was false, he could have heard it wrong \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s hearsay\u201d.\n\nThe Trump circle is accusing the whistleblower of hearsay because he was not present for the 25 July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump said the now notorious words: \u201cI want you to do us a favor though.\u201d In fact, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is not hearsay \u2013 following protocol it draws on eye-witness accounts by direct participants.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Schiff speaks in a hearing this week. Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA\n\nRegardless, Jim Jordan, a pugnacious congressman from Ohio, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cThis individual had no first-hand knowledge, he heard something from somebody.\u201d\n\nIn a feisty exchange, host Jake Tapper said: \u201cThe president was pushing the president of Ukraine to investigate a political rival. I cannot believe that is OK with you.\u201d\n\nJordan replied: \u201cIt is not OK, but he didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nStephen Miller, Trump\u2019s far-right senior adviser, told Fox News Sunday the complaint was a \u201clittle Nancy Drew novel\u201d and the whistleblower a member of the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2013 another Trump conspiracy theory.\n\nRudy Giuliani: Ukraine sources detail attempt to construct case against Biden Read more\n\nIn fact, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was found to \u201cappear credible\u201d by the inspector general, who was appointed by Trump.\n\nFox News Sunday also reported that Giuliani \u201cwas not the only attorney trying to get damaging information on Joe Biden from Ukrainian officials\u201d. Citing an anonymous US official, the report said two more lawyers, Joe DiGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, worked with Giuliani \u201coff the books\u201d on Ukraine, meaning only Trump knows what they did.\n\nTrump appears to be losing the appeal to public opinion. A new CBS News poll found that 55% of Americans approve of the decision to open an impeachment inquiry. But the poll suggests Democrats have work to do. Only 42% said they thought Trump deserved to be impeached, with 36% saying he did not and 22% undecided.\n\nSchiff told ABC: \u201cThe president of the United States used the full weight of his office to try and coerce [Ukraine] to manufacture dirt on his opponent and interfere with our election.\u201d\n\nSenator Cory Booke told CNN Trump acted \u201cless like the leader of the free world and more like a dictator or thug in using American power to pursue his own personal gain\u201d.", "description": "Presidential ally floats refusal to testify to key House committee while Biden campaign asks networks not to book him", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington", "Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82308047b547ede6ac8f8d17ccb987a3b3793e28/0_28_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=52207cd570650b88828050a2c42f328e", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
