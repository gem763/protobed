Ms Pelosi reportedly told him that this was a goal, not a plan.\n\nMr Schumer has said the president then called Ms Pelosi a \"third-rate\" politician. (She later said it was \"third-grade\".)\n\nAt that point, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer reportedly interjected, telling the president that such insults were \"not useful\".\n\nThe Democratic leaders then left the meeting early.\n\nWhat happened afterwards?\n\nSpeaking to reporters following the meeting, Ms Pelosi described it as \"most unsatisfactory\".\n\n\"Two-to-one, the Republicans voted to oppose what he was doing in Syria. He just couldn't handle it so he just kind of engaged in a meltdown,\" she said.\n\nMr Schumer said the president had been \"insulting, particularly to the speaker\".\n\nIt was later that Mr Trump took to Twitter with a series of photos from the meeting, including the one of Ms Pelosi standing and pointing.\n\nIn a final photo, showing three empty seats following the walk-out, he labelled Ms Pelosi and Mr Schumer the \"Do Nothing Democrats\".\n\nHe then said Ms Pelosi \"needs help fast\".\n\n\"She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person,\" he wrote.\n\nAs the photo went viral, some used the hashtag #BeNancy, urging people to take inspiration from the House speaker, while others siding with the president tweeted #PelosiMeltdown.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nWhy is Turkey bombing the Kurds in Syria?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict\n\n.", "description": "A photo of Democrat Nancy Pelosi at an explosive White House meeting on Syria is causing a stir.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1371E/production/_109264697_ehci8z5x4aee67p.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
