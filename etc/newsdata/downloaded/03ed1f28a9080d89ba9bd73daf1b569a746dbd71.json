Photo: Getty Images, Shutterstock\n\nMy cat, Porkchop, has a number of dog-like qualities. For example: He greets me at the door when I come home. When I spend too much time working at my desk and not paying attention to him, he trots up behind me and taps me on the shoulder, begging with big green eyes for me to throw the toy. He sometimes likes to have his tum scratched. And if you find him in an accommodating mood, he will come waddling over when you call his name.\n\nThat last habit has been a particular point of pride for me, evidence that Porkchop is a very smart boy. According to a new study, though, most cats know their names. It\u2019s just that they don\u2019t always care to answer to them.\n\nAtsuko Saito is a psychologist at Tokyo\u2019s Sophia University and an avowed cat person. \u201cI love cats,\u201d she told National Geographic. \u201cThey\u2019re so cute and so selfish. When they want to be touched, they\u2019ll come by me, but when they want to be left alone, they\u2019ll just leave.\u201d Saito has spent a lot of time studying cats, and her previous research \u2014 much of it focused on how our house gremlins respond to our voices, especially when food is involved \u2014 suggested that they may understand their names.\n\nSaito decided to test the theory directly, visiting cats all across Japan. One test group included kitties living with just a few feline companions, or none at all; another comprised households with four or more cats; and another was made up of cats living in cat cafes. In each scenario, researchers watched the way their subjects responded \u2014 if they got up upon being addressed; if they moved their ears, tails, or heads; if they mewed in apparent recognition \u2014 to gauge whether or not they registered the words being said to them.\n\nIn the smaller cat communities, researchers played their subjects recordings of their owners (and of strangers) saying four words that sounded, in rhythm and length, like the cats\u2019 names, and then the names themselves. Of the 11 kitties tested, nine tended to perk up when called correctly; to weed out the possibility that the cats simply responded to the most familiar-sounding noun in the bunch, Saito and her team applied the experiment to the many-cat households.\n\nThis time, the cat captives were read the names of their fellow feline roommates before they heard their own. Just six of the 24 cats involved in this round seemed to stop paying attention as their peers\u2019 names were read out, only to snap to attention when they heard their own monikers. Researchers suggested that these subjects may have come to associate all their names with a looming reward \u2014 food, pets, play \u2014 and therefore sustained attention throughout the procedure.\n\nCafe cats, however, had more muted reactions to their own names compared to the names of other inhabitants, suggesting that cats\u2019 comprehension of their own names may have something to do with the context. Owners often call their cats at meal times, for example, but also when the cat must be corralled into its carrier for a trip to the vet, or scolded for shredding all the toilet paper. Name recognition may be attached to the expectation of rewards and punishment.\n\nIn any case, Saito told National Geographic, the reason why dogs have built this reputation for obediently answering our calls is that we have relentlessly domesticated them in our image, whereas cats domesticated themselves. (Because they love us, and the rodents that stalk our settlements.) \u201cCats are not evolved to respond to human cues,\u201d Saito told New Scientist. \u201cThey will communicate with humans when they want.\u201d And they will also ignore us when they want.\n\nStay in touch.
