I think students should not be studying all the time. They should have some free time to do their own things, such as exercising, shopping, or hanging with friends.\n\nThey are stressed and are looking for a way to feel better.\n\nHow can I get more exercise? Start slow and find something you love to do\n\nAlso, a lack of exercise can contribute to obesity. About one in five Hong Kong schoolchildren are now overweight, according to a Department of Health survey.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, most students only exercise during their PE lesson \u2013 that\u2019s only one hour a week. Research shows that regular exercise can help reduce the symptoms of mental illnesses such as depression.\n\nExercise also promotes positive feelings and make people feel energetic and motivated.\n\nIn addition to learning in the classroom, students need to take part in extracurricular activities to boost their knowledge and learn social skills.\n\nI hope PE lessons won\u2019t be cancelled.\n\nOscar Fu Ho-kwan, Fung Kai No 1 Secondary School\n\nI Say: My favourite subject at school is \u2026\n\nFrom the Editor\n\nThank you for your letter, Oscar.\n\nStudents should not be judged only by their academic results. Since Hong Kong\u2019s education system is exam-oriented, students\u2019 abilities in other areas such as sport, music, or the arts are often neglected.\n\nI agree that physical exercise is key to good health. If you exercise regularly, not only will you be less stressed and less likely to get sick, you will also sleep well and be able to focus better on your studies.\n\nDoctors say we should exercise for at least 30 minutes every day to maintain good health.\n\nWhy aren't there more organ donations in Hong Kong? One doctor says the key to changing minds is education\n\nActually, a lot of schools in Western countries are now encouraging students to take part in physical education.\n\nThese days, many schoolchildren eat unhealthy foods such as fries and burgers, and drink a lot of soft drinks. Exercise helps burn off the extra calories, preventing obesity and many illnesses in later life, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.\n\nI think the government should promote physical activity among schoolchildren.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, PE lessons offer a very welcome break for students.\n\nM.
