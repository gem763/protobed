Such a move, they hoped, would guarantee liquidity during difficult times but also would help the central bank decrease the size of its nearly $4 trillion balance sheet.\n\nBut deciding precisely how many securities the Fed should hold remains a matter of fierce policy debate.\n\nFor example, Powell's 2018 comments that the Fed's balance sheet reduction was on \"autopilot\" sparked a market meltdown that soured markets for much of the quarter. Since October 2017, the Fed has been allowing a set level of proceeds from Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities holdings to roll off each month.\n\nThe reduction, though gradual, curbs the amount of money available to banks at any one time and can sometimes lead to spikes in interest rates when cash isn't immediately available. That happened earlier this week, when the effective federal funds rate on Tuesday rose above the upper bound of the central bank's targeted overnight range.\n\nThe rare spike in rates compelled the Fed to jump in with money market operations aimed at reining them in. After the second such operation Wednesday morning, short-term rates appeared to stabilize.\n\n\"For the foreseeable future, we're going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts of things we did in the last two days, these temporary open market operations. That'll be the tool that we use,\" Powell said.\n\n\"And the question will be, then, as we go through quarter-end, as we learn more, how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves.\"", "description": "Powell said on Wednesday that the Fed may have to resume regular balance sheet growth to help ease money markets.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105761897-1551198266424gettyimages-1127587467.jpeg?v=1568828886", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
