We decided to abandon the N and share a car. I was in the middle of calling one when the N pulled up. We shrugged and got on.\n\nI took a seat, assuming the conversation was over. But he asked the woman sitting next to me whether they could switch seats so that we could keep talking.\n\nWe continued the conversation, sharing good banter and swapping tales of traveling and teaching English abroad.\n\nWe wound up getting off at the same stop, and then hesitated before going our separate ways.\n\n\u201cShould I give you my business card or something?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this works.\u201d\n\nLaughing, I took his card. I walked home feeling the kind of hope that a chance New York encounter can bring. When I got home, I put the card on my nightstand. I hadn\u2019t decided whether to reach out.\n\nThe next morning, I was running late when I got on the train. We were being held at the station. I pulled out the card. The train started moving, and then it stopped again.\n\nAnnoyed, I put the card away and looked around to see why the train wasn\u2019t moving. I saw that the doors had been forced open. Stumbling through them was the guy in the cap.\n\n\u2014 Katie Perkowski", "description": "Sympathetic words in an elevator, a sign from above and more reader tales of New York City in this week\u2019s Metropolitan Diary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/nyregion/15diary-1/15diary-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
