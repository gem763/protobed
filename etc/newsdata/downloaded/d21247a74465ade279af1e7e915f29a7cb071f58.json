The maximum sentence was 30 years.\n\nThe shooting took place outside of the Clearwater Circle A Food Store in Clearwater, Florida after Drejka and McGlockton\u2019s girlfriend, Britany Jacobs, got into an argument about Jacobs\u2019 parking in a handicapped spot, CNN reported.\n\nMcGlockton was in the store with his then-five-year-old son \u2014 their other children had stayed in the car with Jacobs \u2014 but when he came outside to see Drejka arguing with Jacobs, McGlockton shoved Drejka.\n\nDrejka then pulled out a gun and shot McGlockton, who was unarmed and, according to security footage, reportedly turned away from Drejka when he was shot. Drejka had a concealed weapons license.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Drejka was described in court as a \u201cwannabe law enforcement officer\u201d who routinely patrolled this specific parking spot and eventually began bringing a gun with him to watch the space, even after the store\u2019s owner asked him to stop.\n\n\u201cThe jury found that the defendant did not act reasonably or responsibly,\u201d Circuit Judge Joseph Bulone said at the sentencing, per NBC News. Bulone added that when Drejka approached Jacobs about parking illegally, he, too, was parked illegally, calling it the \u201cmost ironic thing about this case.\u201d\n\nDrejka\u2019s lawyer, John Trevena, tells PEOPLE that he is planning a \u201cvigorous appeal,\u201d but that the process could take up to two years.\n\nMarkeis McGlockton | GoFundMe More\n\nRELATED: 4 Dead and 5 Wounded in Early Morning Shooting at Kansas City Bar\n\nTrevena says that Drejka\u2019s legal team does \u201cnot believe our client committed any crime\u201d and called the 20-year sentence \u201cabsurdly excessive.\u201d\n\nMcGlockton\u2019s family\u2019s lawyer, Ben Crump, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment, but told reporters after the sentencing that the case \u201cshowed that equal justice under the law is possible in America for black and brown people, too,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nMcGlockton\u2019s family addressed Drejka in court on Thursday, and both his parents, Monica Moore-Robinson and Michael McGlockton, and his girlfriend Jacobs, gave emotional statements about their lost loved one.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Former Texas Cop Sentenced to 10 Years in Prison for Shooting Neighbor in His Own Home\n\nIn video obtained by NBC News, Moore-Robinson said that her \u201cworld will never be whole again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, but I will never forgive you,\u201d she told her son\u2019s killer.\n\nJacobs said that their four children ask her questions about their dad and said she will \u201ctry to answer as best as I can, but I know I won\u2019t have all the answers either.\u201d\n\nSurveillance footage of the shooting | AP/Shutterstock More", "description": "Florida Man Convicted of Manslaughter Gets 20-Year Sentence", "authors": ["Ashley Boucher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DPG9u9h6Ty6stw_eVFFBHg--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MTgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/3ea9d569d126b90057ea216c9fcbfbe2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
