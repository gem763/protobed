The Lib Dems Brexit pledge may now make her seem reckless", "language": "en", "text": "When Jo Swinson became Liberal Democrat leader in July, some doubters in her own party worried that her weakness might prove to be that she is by instinct too cautious. They can\u2019t accuse her of that now.\n\nIn her closing speech to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth today, Swinson is reiterating her bold pledge to \u201cstop Brexit\u201d by revoking Article 50 \u201con day one.\u201d\n\nThe new policy offers the benefit of clarity, a welcome respite from Labour\u2019s fuzziness on Brexit. It certainly passed the \u201cwill it get noticed?\u201d test, giving a buoyant Lib Dem conference a higher media profile than it would otherwise have enjoyed. It is attractive because it is honest: while Labour offers voters a choice between its own Brexit deal and Remain in a referendum, the Lib Dems can now tell them: \u201cwhat you see, and what you vote for, is what you get.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe bold stance reflects the new dividing Remain versus Leave dividing line and means the Lib Dems no longer have to be \u201call things to all people\u201d, with different messages in different parts of the country as they try to woo Tory and Labour voters. (They can now accuse Labour of doing precisely that on Brexit, while trumping Labour\u2019s referendum pledge to Remainers).\n\nBut even with the Lib Dems, there is a catch. The full sentence in Swinson\u2019s speech is: \u201cwe are crystal clear: a Lib Dem majority government will revoke Article 50 on day one.\u201d While she is right to aim high in such an uncertain political landscape, even the most optimistic Lib Dems find it a bit of a stretch to see her becoming prime minister.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Labour has 247. For all Swinson\u2019s refusal to prop up a Jeremy Corbyn (or Boris Johnson) government and portraying Corbyn as cut from the same populist, pro-Brexit cloth as Nigel Farage, the Lib Dems\u2019 best hope of stopping Brexit will probably lie in supporting the Queen\u2019s Speech of a minority Labour government that includes a referendum.\n\nHer revoke pledge has echoes of Nick Clegg\u2019s 2010 Lib Dem manifesto. It is remembered for its ill-fated pledge to abolish university fees, which the party then trebled to \u00a39,000 a year during its coalition with the Tories. The broken promise became a millstone round Clegg\u2019s neck. In fact, the manifesto pledged to phase out fees over six years. The joke at Westminster at the time was that they would finally be scrapped during the second term of a majority Lib Dem government.\n\nSwinson deserves praise for promising what she really believes in. But will her full throttle revoke pledge really enhance the Lib Dems\u2019 electoral prospects?\n\nThe calculation is that only about one in eight Lib Dem voters are Leavers, so the only way to expand the party\u2019s base is to hoover up the Remain vote. There are hopes the crystal clear pledge will tip some Labour-held seats in Remainer land into the Lib Dem column. True, it might persuade some of the natural Labour voters who backed Swinson\u2019s party at the European Parliament elections in May to stick with the party. But others, even those with doubts about Corbyn, will be tempted to return home, fearing that voting Lib Dem could split the anti-Tory vote in their constituency and allow the Tories to win it.\n\nAs one Lib Dem insider admitted: \u201cThe problem is that we start a long way behind in some Remain seats. Will voters there really think we can win them?\u201d Brexit has changed much, but not the party\u2019s credibility problem under our archaic first-past-the-post system.\n\nSwinson is not only gambling that Johnson will not secure a deal or implement no-deal before an election. She also risks losing support in Tory-held seats, including some of her party\u2019s best hopes in its former south-west stronghold. Overturning the 2016 referendum without holding another one will be a hard sell to many of the estimated 4 million Tory Remain voters, for whom the Lib Dems might otherwise be a natural home.\n\nSwinson also left herself open to the charge of double standards: an election would be good enough to overturn a referendum on Brexit but not on Scottish independence if the SNP won a mandate for one.\n\nEven some Remainers in other parties baulk at a revoke stance as anti-democratic, fearing that it would further polarise our politics rather than bring closure to Brexit as the Lib Dems hope. That is why MPs rejected it as a way to stop no-deal by 293 votes to 184 in March. As Caroline Lucas, the sole Green MP, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t turn back the clock. Nor ignore the 17 million who voted Leave. This doesn\u2019t strengthen our democracy. It further imperils it.\u201d", "description": "When Jo Swinson became Liberal Democrat leader in July, some doubters in her own party worried that her weakness might prove to be that she is by instinct too cautious.\u00a0 They can\u2019t accuse her of that now.", "authors": ["Andrew Grice"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/13/jo-swinson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
