We've had some limited conversations with senior members of Boris Johnson's government about what would be acceptable and how we might achieve that.\"\n\nThe Wigan MP, whose constituency backed Leave in the referendum, said she was ready to back a deal but the prime minister's plans fell short.\n\nShe said: \"What we've got is a proposal which stands virtually no chance of being accepted by the EU which creates two borders on the island of Ireland which is completely incompatible with existing international law and which rips up the workers' rights and protections and the environmental protections that we spent several months at the start of this year negotiating with the former prime minister.\n\n\"I would vote for a deal, but this is not a deal. This is a pre-election party-political broadcast from the prime minister, and the truth is that for all of the talk about getting Brexit done, we are further away from achieving a deal than we were two months ago when he became prime minister.\"\n\nMr Barclay confirmed the government was holding talks with opposition MPs in a bid to secure their backing for a deal.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
