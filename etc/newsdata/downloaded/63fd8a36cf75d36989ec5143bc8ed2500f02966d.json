As a result, retailers end up absorbing higher costs related to marketing, logistics and returns, eroding already-shrinking profits. Last year, for example, holiday returns rose 26 percent in the three weeks after Christmas from the year before, according to DynamicAction, a number that is expected to rise this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough environment, and it\u2019s getting tougher every year,\u201d said John Squire, chief executive of the California-based firm. \u201cAny decline in profitability has an overwhelming effect on retailers that are already struggling to hit their bottom-line numbers.\u201d\n\nThere are already signs that this holiday season could be a challenging one for retailers, as political and economic uncertainty continue to wear down shoppers. U.S. consumers unexpectedly pulled back on retail spending in September for the first time in seven months, and the National Retail Federation has warned that economic upheaval, new tariffs and fluctuations in the stock market could negatively impact consumers\u2019 shopping plans in the coming months. For now, it is predicting a 4 percent increase in holiday spending.\n\n\u201cThe only option is a quick race to the bottom,\u201d Squire said. \u201cThe constant drumbeat of discounts and promotions has only gotten louder.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat dynamic, he said, is compounded during hypercompetitive periods like Amazon\u2019s Prime Day sale in July. In recent years, the e-commerce giants\u2019s competitors have upped the ante to keep up, offering more sweeping discounts and free shipping. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThis year there was an 18 percent increase in discounts and promotions by North American retailers in the two-week period around Prime Day, compared with the same period last year, he said. The value of markdowns increased, too, by about 71 percent. For example, Squire said, an item discounted 20 percent last year would have been 35 percent-off this year. The company analyzed purchases of clothing, shoes, home goods and other general merchandise, but did not include groceries or Amazon purchases.\n\nMarketing costs per order, meanwhile, jumped 16 percent, while profitability fell about 12 percent during that time. There was also a 19 percent rise in returns \u2014 a major cost for retailers \u2014 in the three weeks following the July sale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRetailers, he said, \u201chave had to really juice up the discounts to keep consumers interested.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, average order value and customer profitability are down about 4 percent compared to last year, according to DynamicAction. At the same time, the number of online transactions with free shipping has grown 8 percent.\n\nRetailers have announced roughly 7,600 store closures so far this year \u2014 more than the 5,524 that closed in all of 2018 \u2014 according to data from Coresight Research. An additional 75,000 stores are expected to close by 2026, according to UBS.\n\nAD", "description": "There are already signs that this holiday season could be a challenging one for retailers, as political and economic uncertainty continue to wear down shoppers.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nGW_IflMbJGEAX4yoe8SUw1JE_8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HZY5J7BOZII6RDOJHNI6AKFYIU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
