Together with the 200 forces to Saudi Arabia announced last month, the deployment totaled about 3,000 troops, it said.\n\nU.S.-Iran tensions have risen to new highs since May 2018, when the Trump administration withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the easing of sanctions.\n\nAs Trump reinstated U.S. sanctions, increasing pressure on the Iranian economy, there have been a series of attacks that Washington and close allies have blamed on Iran, including the attack on the world\u2019s biggest crude oil-processing facility. Iran denies responsibility.\n\nIn a bid to better shield Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said it was sending two additional Patriot batteries and one Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD).\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters the deployments were designed to deter Iran.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was important to continue to deploy forces to deter and defend and to send the message to the Iranians: Do not strike another sovereign state, do not threaten American interests, American forces, or we will respond,\u201d Esper told reporters during a press briefing.\n\nRelated Coverage Pentagon confirms large deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia\n\nTrump said the United States would not bear the expense of the deployment. \u201cSaudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s Republican allies have called for retaliatory strikes, which the president has so far declined to carry out.\n\nIt was unclear whether some of the newly announced troops might replace other American forces expected to depart the region in the coming weeks or months.\n\nThe Pentagon has yet to announce, for example, whether it will replace the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group when it eventually wraps up its deployment to the Middle East.\n\nEsper declined to say whether the carrier, which itself includes thousands of troops and massive firepower, would be replaced.\n\nThe deployment is part of a series of what the United States has described as defensive moves following the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities last month, which rattled global energy markets and exposed major gaps in Saudi Arabia\u2019s air defenses.\n\nIran has responded to previous U.S. troop deployments this year with apprehension. It denies responsibility for the attack on Saudi Arabia as well as attacks on oil tankers earlier this year.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Smoke is seen following a fire at an Aramco factory in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, September 14, 2019.
