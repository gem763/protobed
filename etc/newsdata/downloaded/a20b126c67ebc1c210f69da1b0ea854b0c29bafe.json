It says it intends to roll out its free service to other regions in the future, but hasn't yet given a time frame.\n\nSam Mitchell, chief executive of Housesimple, said: 'The ability to sell a home through advertised listings and professional support, without paying any estate agent fees, is unique in the UK.\n\n'Housesimple is the only company to offer this service and we expect it will quickly become the most popular way to sell a property.\n\n'This is a bold move but one that has been tested. Within just six months of trialling this offer we've increased our property listings five-fold and are now one of the leading agents by listings in cities like Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester.'\n\nNot everyone is convinced, however.\n\nBuying agent Henry Pryor told This is Money: 'This sounds like a completely mad idea dreamed up in a pub using a focus group who started drinking at 5pm.\n\n'While estate agents have for a long time earned money from kick backs from mortgage lenders and conveyancing firms this takes the idea to it's logical, pitiful conclusion.\n\nHousesimple currently only operates in the North but plans to roll out nationwide in the future\n\n'There is a famous saying 'if something is free then you're the product' and so it is here it would seem.\n\n'Getting introductory fees from removal firms, change of address card printers, broadband providers as well as the usual financial services providers and the number of people with your data will fit in the phone book!\n\n'The bottom line is who are these agents going to regard as their clients? Who will they work hardest for, the people who pay them or the people whose properties they are supposed to be selling?\n\n'It's a silly idea and one that is unlikely to be copied. There just aren't that many silly estate agents.'\n\nFormer Emoov chief executive Russell Quirk said: 'One of the issues with the online estate agency sector is the perception by potential home sellers that a cheap fee is too cheap.\n\n'Selling a house is a precious process where choosing the best agent is tantamount to whether your sale is a successful one or not.\n\n'Underselling the service is therefore met with suspicion and is why the online sector has struggled to gain more than a 5 per cent market share versus traditional estate agents.\n\n'So, to launch a free service is to perpetuate that suspicion still further and will fail to attract motivated and sensible home sellers.\n\n'Moreover, take it from me, charging too little and merely relying on commission from third party mortgage and conveyancing providers is nowhere near a sustainable business model.'\n\nOnline estate agents are struggling\n\nInternet agents are struggling at the moment. Their share in the market is dropping, revenue is declining, and complaints are on the rise.\n\nWhile traditional high street estate agencies can happily charge commission, the online space is crowded and as such many internet agents offer cheap flat fees that can be paid upfront or down the line.\n\nHousesimple's new service will take this one step further by relying solely on referral fees from third parties selling ancillary products, like home insurance.\n\nIt's the latest round of innovation in a market where good news is few and far between.\n\nOnline agent Emoov went bust last year, losing all 140 staff. The brand has since been bought out and relaunched. Shares in rival Purplebricks nosedived earlier this year after it revised its sales forecast citing a 'challenging' market.\n\nAt the same time, complaints about online estate agencies to the Property Ombudsman saw a 63 per cent rise over the year to a total 398 calls.", "description": "Web-based Housesimple has already been trialling its free service in Yorkshire and the Northwest and plans to roll it out into other regions over the coming months.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
