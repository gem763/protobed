The case is considered a bellwether for more than 2,600 lawsuits by state and local governments that are pending nationally.\n\n\"The settlement allows the company to avoid the resource demands and uncertainty of a trial as it continues to seek meaningful progress in addressing the nation's opioid crisis,\" J&J said in a statement.\n\n\"The company recognises the opioid crisis is a complex public health challenge and is working collaboratively to help communities and people in need,\" it added.\n\nOpioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nJ&J which formerly marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, said the settlement includes no admission of liability.\n\nThe company will pay $10m to Cuyahoga and Summit counties, reimburse $5 million of their legal and other expenses and provide $5.4m to non-profit organisations that run opioid-related programs in the counties.\n\nMallinckrodt Plc finalised a $24m settlement with the same two counties on Monday. Endo International Plc and Allergan Plc also settled with the two counties in August to avoid going to trial.\n\nThe remaining defendants in the October 21 federal trial include McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Henry Schein Inc.\n\nOxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP succumbed to pressure from the lawsuits and filed for bankruptcy protection in September.\n\nSome plaintiffs' lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246bn settlement in 1998.\n\nEarlier in the year, an Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572.1m to the state for its part in fuelling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers.\n\nPurdue Pharma and Teva had settled claims by Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general for $270m and $85m, respectively.", "description": "The company is the fourth US drugmaker to settle claims against it for fuelling the US opioid crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/6/26/ca6578022a734f6a9496e6897d87dec3_18.jpg"}
