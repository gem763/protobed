(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\n\nOfficials at Pacific Gas and Electric Company on Wednesday called for the public to let employees do their jobs safely amid frustrations with a widespread California power shutdown, after authorities reported that a bullet was fired at one of the energy provider\u2019s vehicles.\n\nThe plea came the same day that police say a threatening letter was reported at a PG&E facility, as the utility switched off electricity to hundreds of thousands of people. The planned outage \u2014 the biggest in the state\u2019s history, announced as a measure to reduce wildfire risk \u2014 comes as PG&E faces massive liabilities for starting a blaze that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise last year.\n\n\u201cWe realize and understand the impact and the hardship as the result of this decision that we\u2019ve made,\u201d Sumeet Singh, vice president of PG&E\u2019s Community Wildfire Safety Program, said at a news conference. But employees and contractors \u201chave families that live in your communities, they have friends that are members of your communities,\u201d Singh added. \u201cSo let\u2019s just ensure their safety as well as they are doing this work in the interest of your safety.\u201d\n\n[California cuts power to more than 500,000 as high winds raise wildfire threat]\n\nPower companies worried about California\u2019s devastating wildfires are increasingly turning to planned shutdowns. PG&E says this latest, unusually disruptive measure, which could last several days, was prompted by the dry winds that helped start disasters before. The outages have upset customers, closed schools and workplaces and raised fears that people who rely on electricity for medical needs could be caught unprepared.\n\nSome have questioned this week\u2019s shutdown, which PG&E expects to affect 800,000 people, as excessive. About 650,000 customers were expected to lack power Wednesday evening, according to the company.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be something that can be acceptable nor long term,\u201d state Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo) told the Los Angeles Times, saying power shutdowns should be \u201csurgical.\u201d \u201cThis is Third World, and we are not,\u201d he added.\n\nLawmakers have also accused PG&E of fueling the risks that prompted the shutdown with poor management and maintenance. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said at a news conference Wednesday that he was outraged by the outage \u201cbecause it didn\u2019t have to happen.\u201d\n\nAffected residents who spoke to The Post blamed PG&E, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, all political,\u201d one Napa Valley man, Gregg Bowman, said. \u201cThis company is so screwed up.\u201d\n\nPG&E officials are quick to acknowledge people\u2019s anger but maintain they are prioritizing people\u2019s safety and balancing dueling threats.\n\n\u201cThere are risks of keeping the power on when there are really dangerous fire conditions, and there are risks with turning the power off,\u201d PG&E spokesman Jeff Smith told The Post. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly weighing those two factors.\u201d\n\nWhile PG&E responded to the alleged attack on a company vehicle with calls for customers\u2019 understanding, law enforcement has not announced a motive.\n\nA PG&E employee was driving a truck Tuesday evening in Northern California\u2019s Colusa County \u2014 before the electricity cutoffs \u2014 when a bullet shattered one of the vehicle\u2019s windows, the California Highway Patrol told the Associated Press. The driver was not hurt, according to the AP.\n\nCHP is investigating the incident, which occurred north of the town of Maxwell as the staffer headed southbound on Interstate 5, according to authorities. A white, Chevy-style pickup may have pulled up beside the PG&E truck before the shooting, CHP Officer J. Sherwood told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nSingh expressed particular concern over the vehicle\u2019s reported targeting.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a marked PG&E vehicle or contractors that are working on our behalf, again just a reminder, they are no different than our customers, and their families and their kids go to the same schools that our customers do,\u201d he said.\n\nOther incidents were raising security concerns elsewhere in the state where PG&E serves about 16 million customers.\n\nPolice in Oroville increased their patrols around PG&E properties Wednesday after an \u201cangry customer\u201d egged an office and left a \u201cthreatening note,\u201d a department spokeswoman said. The extra patrols will continue for as long as the power outage lasts, she said.\n\nNo one has been cited yet for the egging, the spokeswoman added, saying that she could not share the contents of the note but that police think it was motivated by the power outage.\n\nIn San Francisco, staff erected an L-shaped barricade in front of the company\u2019s headquarters while citing \u201cthe safety of our employees,\u201d the Chronicle reported.\n\nSmith declined to elaborate on what prompted the increased security in San Francisco and referred The Post to law enforcement for details on the egging and shooting reports. He also declined to discuss any additional security measures PG&E is taking.\n\nSmith said the company\u2019s employees are working hard to restore power quickly. The company expects conditions to improve Thursday to the point where employees can begin inspecting thousands of miles of power lines. PG&E hopes power can be restored within 48 hours of the inspections\u2019 start, but Smith warned the outages could last longer.\n\n\u201cWe know that turning off the power for safety is not popular with some, but it is needed for public safety,\u201d he said.", "description": "PG&E's employees \"are no different than our customers, and their families and their kids go to the same schools that our customers do,\" a company official said.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Am", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
