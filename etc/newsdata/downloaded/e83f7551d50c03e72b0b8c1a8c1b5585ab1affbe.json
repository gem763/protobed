Farhan Akhtar played the role to perfection. In the biopic there are references to a Pakistani athlete called Abdul Khaliq. Milkha shared a healthy rivalry with him on the track and it is that man we wish to talk about.\n\nKhaliq has been pretty much forgotten by Pakistan since his death in 1988, but the man was once the fastest runner in Asia. Jawaharlal Nehru was so mesmerised by him in the 1954 Asian Games that he called him The Flying Bird of Asia. On that occasion he won the 100m gold medal and the 4x100m relay silver.\n\nReuters\n\nKhaliq and Milkha hada huge rivalry, stemming from the relationship of their respective nations. But Milkha has beaten Khaliq in all races though some have been very close.\n\nThe man was quick and has 63 international medals to prove it. He has won a lot of laurels both in Asian and Commonwealth Games. Khaliq, who served in the Pakistan army, also took part in the World Military Games. The man took part in 2 Asian Games and 2 Olympics and pretty much put Pakistan on the map as far as athletics is concerned.\n\nDon't Miss 2.2 K SHARES 4 K SHARES 514 SHARES 4.6 K SHARES 4.9 K SHARES\n\nHe took on the best and many times came out on top.

Truth be told, many of us would never have heard of him if not for Milkha Singh's biopic.\n\nNonetheless, Khaliq has a legacy to be proud of and ranks right up there with the best of the best.", "description": "Most of us saw the movie Bhaag Milkha Bhaag were the life of iconic athlete Milkha Singh made its way to the big screen.
