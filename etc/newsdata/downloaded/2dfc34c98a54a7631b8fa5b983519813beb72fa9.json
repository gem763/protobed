But Cain has well and truly got the wrong end of the stick \u2013 and Pete is forced to reveal the truth about Moira\u2019s fling with Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter) to save his own life.\n\nFaith (Sally Dexter) has realised that Moira has been cheating on Cain but while she is half-right, she has jumped to totally the wrong conclusion after seeing Moira and Pete talking closely and secretly in the village.\n\nPete knows about Moira\u2019s affair with Nate and has been urging her to put a stop to it, but seeing them talking so urgently has led Faith to the conclusion that Pete is her secret man on the side. Tonight, she fills her son Cain in on the fact that Moira has been unfaithful and when Cain hears that it\u2019s Pete, his expression darkens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSetting a trap for oblivious Pete, Cain lies in wait and when he enters the room, Cain knocks him out before tying him up and confronting him. At first, Pete decides to protect Moira\u2019s secret but when it becomes clear that Cain considers himself with little to lose, he becomes terrified about how far he will go.\n\nAs the stakes are raised, Pete decides that Nate is not worth putting himself on the line to protect so he tells Cain the real truth. As Cain is left flabbergasted by what he has discovered, he leaves Pete tied up while he heads out to lay another trap \u2013 and this one will have even more serious consequences.\n\nFaith discovers Pete tied up and he warns her that Cain seems hell bent on killing Nate and Faith fears that Cain could destroy his own life.\n\nWith a fight to the death and an explosion to follow, is Cain about to see through his threats of murder?\n\nEmmerdale continues on Monday 21st October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cain lashes out but he has the wrong man.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/21_10_emm_cain_pete_01-0c00_1571648424.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
