Now, with three young children of her own, the 27-year-old thinks it is because she looks like her father, who left when she and her sister were very young.\n\n\u201cI remember my dad coming to my defence once when I was about 12, telling my mum that she couldn\u2019t choose to love one daughter more than the other. That was the last time my mum let him in the house,\u201d she says.\n\nDiya, who has \u201cspent a lot of time with counsellors over the years, talking about my mother\u201d, still struggles to accept the difference in how she and her sister, just a year older, were treated by her mother. \u201cIt persists to this day,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother spent \u00a36,000 on my sister\u2019s wedding and did a load of the organisation for her. I got married recently. She paid for half of my wedding dress and finally gave me a present many weeks later. She didn\u2019t get involved in the wedding arrangements; she couldn\u2019t find any time for me at all.\u201d\n\nDiya\u2019s big fear is seeing the favouritism pass down the generations. \u201cMy mother has let my kids down a few times already \u2013 cancelling at the last minute on their birthdays \u2013 but now my sister is pregnant,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting to see if her baby gets more attention than my kids. If I see any signs of favouritism there, too, then the relationship between my mum and me will be finished for good. I\u2019m not having my children feel the pain I did.\u201d\n\nThese children are likely to fare much less well because they internalise all the bad things being said and done to them\n\nShe is not alone. In a recent study, 85% of respondents believed that their mothers had a favourite among their siblings. The finding chimes with many years of research about parental favouritism, which has found that many parents admit to having a favourite child. Dig a little deeper, though, and it turns out that most favouritism has less to do with love and more to do with like: the same parents say that they love their children equally, but that one child\u2019s personality resonates more with them than those of their siblings.\n\nBut Prof Helen Dent, who has worked with families where one child is made the scapegoat, usually of their parents\u2019 unresolved emotional baggage, says it can cause serious problems. \u201cIt\u2019s highly damaging to a child when they are the only one their parents will not care for,\u201d she says. \u201cThese children are likely to fare much less well because they internalise all the bad things being said and done to them. This can have horrific effects on their self-esteem.\u201d\n\nSara grew up knowing \u2013 and accepting \u2013 that she was the black sheep of her family; that her sisters were loved and cherished in a way that she was not. \u201cThere was no question about it: from a young age, I was the least favourite of my parents\u2019 three children,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember being jealous of my sisters when I was very young, but then I became resigned to feeling that I was an intruder, on the outside of my own family.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018My sister grew up walking this rose-strewn path \u2013 she wasn\u2019t prepared for the fact that real life is tough.\u2019 Illustration: Ellen Wishart/Guardian Design\n\nGrowing up in an outwardly happy family \u2013 her mother was a midwife, her father a doctor \u2013 it was only later that Sara understood the hidden dynamic: \u201cI found out when I was 11 that I was illegitimate,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother was pregnant \u2013 and had been deserted \u2013 when she met the medical student she went on to marry. In their minds, I wasn\u2019t a \u2018doctor\u2019s daughter\u2019 like my sisters: I was just some random man\u2019s offspring.\u201d\n\nSara, now in her late 50s, is in no doubt that her parents loved and liked her less than her siblings. \u201cWhen I started school at five, I was left alone. And I mean alone: Mum was proud of telling people that she could stay at work until late because I came home, cooked my supper and often put myself to bed.\u201d\n\nWhen her sisters came along, they had very different childhoods: \u201cThey were never left alone. They were favoured emotionally and financially. My sister was bought a record player for her ninth birthday, for example, and I got nothing. Later, they both got driving lessons. Not me.\u201d\n\nThe impact of such early ill-treatment has affected Sara throughout her life, but the favouritism scarred her sisters, too: \u201cMy sisters feel guilty because of the attention they got from my parents. And because of the way they were treated as children, they now pretty much feel they can do no wrong and are better than those around them. They\u2019ve both had very bad relationships with men as a result.\u201d\n\nSara is sure that it is worse being in a family with a favourite than it is to be in an unloving household. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the \u2018unfavoured\u2019 child feels unloved. Their siblings feel lots of pressure on them to be perfect, and to be the duplicate of the parents all the time. They grow up with this massive, underlying fear that their parents\u2019 love could be withdrawn from them as it has been from their sibling.\u201d\n\nFavoured siblings will feel a lack of safety \u2013 if their parents\u2019 love isn\u2019t unconditional, who knows what may happen?\n\nDent agrees. \u201cSiblings will feel gleeful and relieved that they\u2019re getting the approval, but they will also, consciously or subconsciously, feel guilt and a lack of safety because, if their parents\u2019 love isn\u2019t unconditional, who knows what may happen to them next?\u201d\n\nMargaret, 46, started counselling 18 months ago and came to realise how scarred she was by the fact her sister was so obviously her parents\u2019 favourite. But she also realised that her relationship with her sister had broken down a few years before largely because of emotional wounds carried by them both since childhood.\n\n\u201cI think that it is her relationship with me that has been affected, rather than mine with her,\u201d she says. \u201cMy sister grew up with the upper hand, getting all of my parents\u2019 praise. We have tried to be close as adults, but it doesn\u2019t work. I suspect she feels guilty about how I was treated, but also \u2013 because she grew up walking this rose-strewn path that my parents laid before her \u2013 she wasn\u2019t prepared for the fact that real life is tough. I\u2019ve ended up doing better than her professionally, and she finds that very hard.\u201d\n\nThanks to counselling, Margaret recently began unravelling her childhood. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realised that I\u2019d internalised the message that I wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mental wellbeing has been badly affected. It has made me push myself to the limit on every occasion; I frequently make myself ill with excessive determination to push things through. I feel I have to constantly prove myself. I never ask for support or help.\u201d\n\nMargaret, however, has a close and loving relationship with her daughter, who is 11. \u201cI have made sure that I\u2019m a really good friend to my daughter, as well as being her mother,\u201d she says. \u201cI have very consciously made her the centre of my world \u2013 the exact opposite of where my parents put me in the family.\u201d\n\nSome names have been changed", "description": "Many mothers and fathers admit to having a preferred child \u2013 and experts say that being a sidelined sibling can cause serious problems", "authors": ["Amelia Hill"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba8b9c9dcd88cbca3a046f7638268d3f7505acf/2_0_8885_5333/master/8885.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2494f463b953c8787ae49bb1ba0b022", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
