Online court records show Ator was arrested in 2001 for a misdemeanor offense that would not have prevented him from legally purchasing firearms in Texas, although authorities have not said where Ator got his weapon.\n\nAtor acted alone and federal investigators believe the shooter had no ties to any domestic or international terrorism group, FBI special agent Christopher Combs said. Authorities said those killed were between the ages of 15 and 57 years old but did not immediately provide a list of names. The injured included three law enforcement officers, as well as a 17-month-old girl who sustained injuries to her face and chest.\n\nOdessa Police Chief Michael Gerke refused to say the name of the shooter during a televised news conference, saying he wouldn\u2019t give him notoriety, but police later posted his name on Facebook. A similar approach has been taken in some other recent mass shootings.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at a local university Sunday evening for a prayer vigil to console each other grieve the loss of life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here in the middle of nowhere,\u201d Midland Mayor Jerry Morales told the crowd. \u201cAll we\u2019ve talked about is oil forever. And then this happens.\u201d\n\nGerke said there were still no answers pointing to a motive for the chaotic rampage, which began Saturday afternoon when Texas state troopers tried pulling over a gold car on Interstate 20 for failing to signal a left turn.\n\nBefore the vehicle came to a complete stop, the driver \u201cpointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots\u201d toward the patrol car stopping him, according to Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger. The gunshots struck a trooper, Cesinger said, after which the gunman fled and continued shooting. He fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland, two cities in the heart of Texas oil country more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) west of Dallas. At one point, he hijacked a mail carrier truck, killing the lone postal worker inside.\n\nU.S. Postal Service officials identified her as Mary Granados, 29.\n\nPolice used a marked SUV to ram the mail truck outside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa, disabling the vehicle. The gunman then fired at police, wounding two officers. Combs said the gunman might have entered the theater if police had not killed him.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of a man driving down the highway shooting at people, local law enforcement and state troopers pursued him and stopped him from possibly going into a crowded movie theater and having another event of mass violence,\u201d Combs said.\n\nPolice said Ator had no outstanding warrants. His arrest in 2001 was in the county where Waco is located, hundreds of miles east of Odessa. Online court records show he was charged then with misdemeanor criminal trespass and evading arrest. He entered guilty pleas in a deferred prosecution agreement where the charge was waived after he served 24 months of probation, according to records.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said a 17-month-old girl is recovering but faces surgery on Monday to remove shrapnel from her right chest. She also suffered injuries to her face. Abbott says the mother texted: \u201cHer mouth is pretty bad, but will heal and can be fixed. Thankfully it doesn\u2019t seem like her jaw was hit. Just lips, teeth and tongue\u2026We are thanking God for healing her and appreciate continued prayers.\u201d\n\nThe shooting came at the end of an already violent month in Texas, where on Aug. 3 a gunman in the border city of El Paso killed 22 people at a Walmart. Sitting beside authorities in Odessa, Abbott ticked off a list of mass shootings that have now killed nearly 70 since 2016 in his state alone.\n\n\u201cI have been to too many of these events,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cToo many Texans are in mourning. Too many Texans have lost their lives. The status quo in Texas is unacceptable, and action is needed.\u201d\n\nBut Abbott, a Republican, remains noncommittal about imposing any new gun laws in Texas at a time when Democrats and gun-control groups are demanding restrictions. And even as Abbott spoke, a number of looser gun laws that he signed this year took effect on the first day of September, including one that would arm more teachers in Texas schools.\n\nSaturday\u2019s shooting brings the number of mass killings in the U.S. so far this year to 25, matching the number in all of 2018, according to The AP/USATODAY/Northeastern University mass murder database. The number of people killed this year has already reached 142, surpassing the 140 people who were killed of all last year. The database tracks homicides where four or more people are killed, not including the offender.\n\nWitnesses described gunfire near shopping plazas and in busy intersections.\n\nDr. Nathaniel Ott was working at an Odessa emergency care center where he is the medical director when he heard gunshots. He rushed outside to find a woman in the driver\u2019s seat of an SUV bleeding from a gunshot wound in the arm. Ott said that as he and a paramedic were working on the woman, the shooter drove back by.\n\n\u201cThe shooter drove within 30 feet of us and drove up that road,\u201d Ott said Sunday, pointing to one of the streets leading past the shopping center where his facility is located. \u201cThe shooter was driving. It was insane. He was just everywhere.\u201d\n\nDaniel Munoz, 28, of Odessa, was headed to a bar to meet a friend when he noticed the driver of an approaching car was holding what appeared to be a rifle.\n\n\u201cThis is my street instincts: When a car is approaching you and you see a gun of any type, just get down,\u201d said Munoz, who moved from San Diego about a year ago to work in oil country. \u201cLuckily I got down. \u2026 Sure enough, I hear the shots go off. He let off at least three shots on me.\u201d\n\nHe said he was treated at a hospital and is physically OK, though bewildered by the experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to turn the corner and I got shot \u2013 I\u2019m getting shot at? What\u2019s the world coming to? For real?\u201d\n\nWeber reported from Austin.
