But when you see these wrecks on the bottom of the ocean and everything, you kind of get a feel for what the real price is for war,' said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, D.C., who is onboard the Petrel. 'You see the damage these things took, and it's humbling to watch some of the video of these vessels because they're war graves.'\n\nSonar images of the Kaga show the bow of the heavy carrier hit the seafloor at a high rate of speed, scattering debris and leaving an impact crater that looks as if an explosion occurred in the ocean.\n\nThe front of the vessel is buried in mud and sediment after nose-diving about three miles to the bottom.\n\nThe U.S. bombs that struck the Kaga caused a massive fire that left it charred, but the ship stayed mostly together. Its guns, some still intact, stick out from the side.\n\nA research vessel called the Petrel is launching underwater robots about halfway between the U.S. and Japan in search of warships from the Battle of Midway\n\nWeeks of grid searches around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands already have led the Petrel to one sunken battleship, the Kaga\n\nThis week, it's investigating what could be another. The other three Japanese aircraft carriers - the Akagi, Soryu and Hiryu - and the Japanese cruiser Mikuma are still unaccounted for\n\nDirector of subsea operations of the Petrel, Rob Kraft looks at images of the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga, off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands\n\nRob Kraft, left, and the Naval History and Heritage Command's Frank Thompson, left, look at footage of the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga\n\nRob Kraft, director of undersea operations at Vulcan Inc., reviews sonar scans of a warship from the World War II Battle of Midway off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands\n\nUntil now, only one of the seven ships that went down in the June 1942 air and sea battle - five Japanese vessels and two American - had been located.\n\nThe crew of the research vessel Petrel is hoping to find and survey all lost ships from the 1942 Battle of Midway, which historians consider a pivotal fight for the U.S. in the Pacific during WWII.\n\nThe battle was fought between American and Japanese aircraft carriers and warplanes about 200 miles off Midway Atoll, a former military installation that the Japanese hoped to capture in a surprise attack.\n\nThe U.S., however, intercepted Japanese communications about the strike and were waiting when they arrived. More than 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans died.\n\nKraft looks at images of the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga, off Midway Atoll.The research vessel called the Petrel is launching underwater robots about halfway between the U.S. and Japan in search of warships from the Battle of Midway\n\nThe researchers used an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, equipped with sonar to find the ship\n\nThe vehicle had been out overnight collecting data, and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning\n\nThe crew reviews sonar scans of a warship from the World War II Battle of Midway that was found by the crew of the research vessel Petrel on Sunday\n\nThe expedition is an effort started by the late Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft\n\nThe expedition is an effort started by the late Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft.\n\nKraft says the crew's mission started with Allen's desire to honor his father's military service. Allen died last year.\n\n'It really extends beyond that at this time,' Kraft said. 'We're honoring today's service members, it's about education and, you know, bringing history back to life for future generations.'\n\nFor years, the crew of the 250-foot Petrel has worked with the U.S. Navy and other officials around the world to locate and document sunken ships. It has found more than 30 vessels so far.\n\nIt is illegal to otherwise disturb the underwater U.S. military gravesites, and their exact coordinates are kept secret.\n\nThis is the first time it has looked for warships from the Battle of Midway, which took place six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe attack from the Japanese Imperial Navy was meant to be a surprise, a strike that would give Japan a strategic advantage in the Pacific.\n\nIt was thwarted when U.S. analysts decoded Japanese messages and baited their enemy into revealing its plan.\n\nRetired Navy Captain Jack Crawford poses for a photo at his home in Rockville, Maryland.

U.S. planes sank four of Japan's aircraft carriers and a cruiser, and downed dozens of its fighter planes.\n\nOne of the American ships lost was the USS Yorktown, an aircraft carrier that was heavily damaged and being towed by the U.S. on the battle's final day when it was hit by torpedoes.\n\nThe other, the USS Hammann, went down trying to defend the Yorktown.\n\nAn aerial view of the 2.5 square mile Midway Atoll half way between the U.S. and Japan\n\nA sign is shown on a damaged World War II building on Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands\n\nA damaged World War II radar station is shown on Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands\n\nA damaged World War II building shown on Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands\n\nRetired Navy Capt. Jack Crawford, who recently turned 100, was among the Yorktown's 2,270 survivors.\n\nJapanese dive bombers left the Yorktown badly damaged, with black smoke gushing from its stacks, but the vessel was still upright.\n\nThen the torpedoes hit said Captain Crawford: 'Bam! Bam! We get two torpedoes, and I know we're in trouble. As soon as the deck edge began to go under, I knew . she wasn't going to last.'\n\nCaptain Crawford's later military career was with the naval nuclear propulsion program. He also served as deputy assistant secretary for nuclear energy in the Department of Energy.\n\nAn aerial photo of a Japanese carrier maneuvering in a complete circle in an effort to escape in the Midway Islands, Hawaii\n\nIn this May 1942 file photo a Japanese heavy cruiser of the Mogami class lies low in the water after being bombed by U.S. naval aircraft during the Battle of Midway\n\nCrewmen aboard the USS Yorktown are shown battling fire after the carrier was hit by Japanese bombs, during the Battle of Midway. Later the vessel had to be abandoned and was sunk by a Japanese submarine torpedo hit\n\nThe Yorktown sank slowly, and a destroyer was able to pick up Captain Crawford and many others.\n\nIn May 1998, almost 56 years later, an expedition led by the National Geographic Society in conjunction with the U.S. Navy found the Yorktown 3 miles (5 kilometers) below the surface.\n\nCrawford doesn't see much value in these missions to find lost ships, unless they can get some useful information on how the Japanese ships went down. But he wouldn't mind if someone was able to retrieve his strongbox and the brand-new sword he left in it when he and others abandoned ship 77 years ago.\n\nHe was too far away to see the Kaga go down.\n\nA piece of the Japanese aircraft carrier was discovered in 1999, but its main wreckage was still missing - until last week.\n\nIn this May 1942 file photo a Japanese heavy cruiser of the Mogami class lies low in the water after being bombed by U.S. naval aircraft during the Battle of Midway\n\nUSS Yorktown listing heavily to port after being struck by Japanese bombers and torpedo planes in the Battle of Midway\n\nAfter receiving some promising sonar readings, the Petrel used underwater robots to investigate and get video. It compared the footage with historical records and confirmed this week it had found the Kaga.\n\nThe other three Japanese aircraft carriers - the Akagi, Soryu and Hiryu - and the Japanese cruiser Mikuma are still unaccounted for.\n\nThe Petrel crew hopes to find and survey all the wreckage from the entire battle, an effort that could add new details about Midway to history books.\n\nJune 4 1942 photo provided by the U.S. Navy shows a scene on the flight deck of USS Yorktown shortly after it was hit by two Japanese aerial torpedoes\n\nEarlier this year, they discovered the USS Hornet, an aircraft carrier that helped win the Battle of Midway but sank in the Battle of Santa Cruz near the Solomon Islands less than five months later. More than 100 crew members died.\n\nThe Petrel also discovered the USS Indianapolis, the U.S. Navy's single deadliest loss at sea.\n\nRob Kraft, director of subsea operations on the Petrel, says Allen gave him and his crew a mission to preserve history, educate people about the past and honour those who fought on these great ships. Allen died last year.\n\nMr Kraft said: 'We're still carrying on Paul's legacy to honour our service members.\n\n'This originated from his desire to honour his father's service to his country, and to remember our service members and to make sure that future generations remember that as well, and they actually understand what that means and to respect that.'\n\nJune 4, 1942 photo shows Japanese Type 97 shipboard attack aircraft from the carrier Hiryu amid heavy anti-aircraft fire, during the torpedo attack on USS Yorktown (CV-5) in the mid-afternoon\n\nUSS Astoria (CA-34) steams by USS Yorktown (CV-5), shortly after the carrier had been hit by three Japanese bombs in the battle of Midway\n\nThe sun rises over Vulcan Inc.'s research vessel Petrel nearly 200 miles off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands", "description": "Hundreds of miles off Midway Atoll, nearly halfway between the United States and Japan, a research vessel is launching underwater robots to look for warships from the Battle of Midway.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/03/19973740-0-image-a-64_1571624219675.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
