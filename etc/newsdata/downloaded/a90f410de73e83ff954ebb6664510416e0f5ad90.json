That is a significant cultural shift in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t dictate to a country or a religion about how they handle things but, having said that, WWE is at the forefront of a women\u2019s evolution in the world and what you can\u2019t do is affect change anywhere by staying away from it.\"", "description": "WWE have confirmed Natalya and Lacey Evans will go head to head in Riyadh with Tyson Fury also on the bill at Crown Jewel", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755061.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Natalya-vs-Lacey-Evans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
