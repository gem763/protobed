That\u2019s fine, and maybe that offers an opportunity to get philosophical about the point of a museum at all. It\u2019s to preserve our cultural treasure, yes, and to educate, of course, and to give philanthropists the opportunity to feel they\u2019re doing more good than harm. But really, truly, it\u2019s to entertain. The MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other institutions across the world are not, as one way of thinking has it, cathedrals; they\u2019re closer to theme parks. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an evil; I think it\u2019s just a fact.\n\nFaith Ringgold, American People Series #20: Die, 1967 The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\n\nThe current iteration of MoMA is beautiful, but logistics matter more than aesthetics (a Modernist tenet!). The vast lobby is stunning, but designed to recede; there\u2019s space for crowds, and a sense of logic, like the efficient maze you find at an especially well-run Whole Foods checkout (I mean this as a compliment). The old museum always felt so crowded, like an interminable TSA line. The people will come, inevitably, and at last the building feels ready for them: You know just where to stand if you want to linger with your selfie stick, and know just where to queue up if you need to buy a ticket, and it\u2019s also clear how to beat a path into the museum\u2019s recesses to actually see some art.\n\nI highly endorse the last. Revisiting MoMA always reminds me how absolutely great MoMA is, more so now, as the institution is using this reopening to reintroduce and celebrate itself. No point in false modesty, I suppose. I think many of us\u2014myself included\u2014have the wrong expectations of an art museum. You weigh the ticket price (steep!) against your time and try to maximize your investment, dashing from masterpiece to masterpiece. Or you go looking for transcendence, as though that\u2019s to be found in a sea of people making Instagram stories. One of the many things that art is about is pleasure, and MoMA understands that better than almost any other art museum in New York.\n\nThe point is to narrate the development of art, sure, to walk the line from James Ensor to Jeff Koons. No matter what you like, there\u2019s something for you. If Rauschenberg is too recherch\u00e9, maybe Monet is more your speed. If Rousseau doesn\u2019t move you, perhaps Jacob Lawrence will. If you don\u2019t find pleasure here, perhaps art is not your bag?\n\nBut things are ... different. The curators are up to something. They\u2019ve rescued Faith Ringgold\u2019s American People Series #20: Die, which used to hang in a passageway, and placed it in a room full of Picassos. Doris Salcedo\u2019s Widowed House IV, a delicate construction of a door, some sheer fabric, and bone, is a whisper compared to Richard Serra\u2019s insistent steel boxes in the gallery adjacent. Marisol\u2019s Love, a plaster mouth imbibing or possibly fellating a glass Coke bottle, sits in front of Jasper Johns\u2019s Flag (my favorite juxtaposition). It\u2019s a quiet rebellion, an attempt to complicate how we think of the canon. But it\u2019s not a lecture. These aren\u2019t heavy-handed flourishes, but thought-provoking ones.", "description": "After an expansive renovation, the MoMA reopens its doors.", "authors": ["Rumaan Alam"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/bb6a5e1bb2e5c9b0fa6700847703c68c2cdb5530.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
