Core consumer prices, which exclude the volatile categories of food and energy, increased 0.3% from the previous month. ?\n\nFrom a year earlier, the CPI increased 1.7% in August and core prices climbed 2.4%, the fastest annual pace since July 2018 when core prices also rose 2.4%. ?\n\nPrices for an array of goods and services rose last month. Rent and medical prices were among the drivers behind stronger inflation in August. ?\n\nThe inflation figures leave the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates next week by a quarter-percentage point. ?\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell cited weaker inflation in July, along with trade uncertainty and slow global growth, when justifying the central bank's decision to cut its benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter point to a range between 2% and 2.25%. ?\n\nFirming core inflation should reassure Fed officials who have worried about weak price pressures this year. The central bank seeks to keep annual inflation at 2% because officials see that level as consistent with a healthy economy. Lower inflation also tends to weigh on interest rates and give the Fed less room to cut them in a downturn. ?\n\nSome officials have cited tepid inflation as among the reasons to cut interest rates. For others, however, a third straight monthly rise of 0.3% in core inflation could strengthen the case against reducing them by more than a quarter point or at all. ?\n\nFed officials are unlikely to consider following President Trump's call Wednesday for them to lower the rate to zero or below. ?\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation as measured by a different gauge, the personal-consumption-expenditures price index, which includes many components of the consumer-price index. The PCE price index has been running below the central bank's target and rose 1.4% in July from a year earlier. The core PCE index rose 1.6% from a year earlier. ?\n\nRichard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corporation, noted that it will take time for core PCE to catch up with core CPI, leaving room for Fed policy makers to go ahead with a rate reduction next week. ?\n\n\"Clearly, with their focus squarely on sustaining the expansion and mitigating the downside risks from global trade disputes, the August CPI data will not deter the [Fed] from cutting the funds rate at their September meeting,\" Mr. Moody wrote in a note. ?\n\nA separate report showed real average hourly earnings, a measure of inflation-adjusted earnings, increased 0.4% in August from a month earlier. ?\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com and Likhitha Butchireddygari at likhitha.butchireddygari@wsj.com ?\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 12, 2019 14:45 ET (18:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
