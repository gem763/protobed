Pretty much everyone on stage except Julian Castro and Cory Booker\u2014who may be thinking \"vice president\" has a nice ring to it at this point\u2014jumped at the opportunity to take shots at the new polling co-leader. They abided by Omar Little's principles of regicide with varying degrees of success.\n\nPete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar formed the Centrist Brigade to attack Warren's healthcare plan as unrealistic and too expensive and people like their private insurance and how are you going to pay for it? (For Klobuchar, in particular, this is part of a rich tradition of inspiring rhetoric.) Others, too, seized on the big numbers involved in a Medicare For All system\u2014$30 trillion over 10 years!\u2014and joined with the moderators to completely ignore that we as a society are projected to spend at least that under our current system. Also under the current system, 30 million more people are uninsured and a big chunk of all that spending goes towards the salaries and bonuses of healthcare industry executives.\n\nAs in every other debate, the moderators were desperate to get Warren to say her plan would raise middle-class taxes, a ploy she repeatedly dodged, presumably because she could see the soundbite featuring in a future attack ad. The evasion did not come off well, although Warren's point\u2014that overall costs for the middle class would go down\u2014isn't wrong. Yes, taxes would go up, but people would not pay insurance premiums and deductibles and all the rest. The tax angle is a talking point, and yes, it's a Republican one. In general, though, Warren needs to sort out her message on the money side. (Bernie Sanders, for his part, simply admits taxes will go up.) The healthcare discussion was probably her worst moment in any of the debates, even if she was taking fire from all sides.\n\nPhoto credit: Win McNamee - Getty Images More\n\nAndrew Yang had a slightly bewildering night, but he had an intriguing attack on Warren's\u2014and, for that matter, Sanders's\u2014plan for a wealth tax. He pointed out a number of European countries, like Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden, have abandoned theirs, at least partly because rich people are so good at evading taxes. This is a problem for any tax on the wealthiest people in our society, but as NBC News' Benjy Sarlin pointed out, even with significant avoidance, a plan like Warren's would still bring in trillions in revenue. Considering the top earners now pay lower effective tax rates than the working class, something clearly needs to be done\u2014and it's not clear how Yang's alternative, a Value Added Tax (VAT), would do the job. Consumption taxes are regressive.\n\nBut by far the weirdest Warren-involved confrontation featured\u2014inevitably\u2014her co-frontrunner, Joe Biden. The former vice president had a rocky start on a question about his son Hunter's legitimately shady business dealings in Ukraine. (It is perfectly legitimate to ask why the sitting vice president's son was taking $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian oligarch. It's just that Donald Trump inevitably overplayed his hand\u2014and likely broke the law\u2014pursuing this line of inquiry.) Biden mostly settled down after that until it came time to discuss Warren's first big project in national politics, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Biden, you see, wanted Warren to know he'd whipped votes to get it passed.", "description": "The former vice president tried to seize some credit for Warren's biggest project in American politics.
