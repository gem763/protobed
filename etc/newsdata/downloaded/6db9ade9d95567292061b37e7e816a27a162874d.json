We would like to reiterate our opposition to any countries to use human rights as an excuse to interfere any country's internal affairs and attempts to put pressure in the name of human rights should be avoided,\" said the representative from Myanmar.\n\nZhang Jun, permanent representative of China to the UN, refuted the \"baseless\" comments on Xinjiang made by the United States and some other countries.\n\nZhang said that the US and a few other countries made \"groundless accusations\" against China, which is \"gross interference in China's internal affairs and a deliberate provocation of confrontation\".\n\n\"China firmly opposes and rejects it,\" he said.\n\nHe reiterated that Xinjiang's preventive measures of counterterrorism and de-radicalization are based on law and consistent with the will of the people.\n\n\"This is not about human rights and has nothing to do with racial discrimination,\" he said. \"China wants to tell the United States and other countries not to confront the international community and not to go any further on the wrong path.\"", "description": "Belarus made a joint statement Tuesday on behalf of 54 countries in firm support of China's counterterrorism and de-radicalization measures in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8fe06a310cf3e97a3890b.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
