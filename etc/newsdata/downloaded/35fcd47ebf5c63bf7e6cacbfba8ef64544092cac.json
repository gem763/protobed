I didn\u2019t feel her in a sexual way, I didn\u2019t look at it that way. I sat with my lawyers who said what could happen.\u2019\n\nPaul has opened up about his \u2018difficult\u2019 year (Picture: ITV)\n\nWhen asked whether he was scared after being arrested, Paul revealed: \u2018Not at first, I think I was more scared when I sat with my lawyers.\n\n\u2018Obviously I did get worried and could have taken the easy way with alcohol but I stayed strong through it.\u2019\n\nThe 52-year-old recalled how he found comfort throughout the ordeal in the support of the public.\n\nHe added: \u2018I spent the whole year telling people I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Every time I felt like drinking I just rang my sponsors.\u2019\n\nPaul was cleared last week at Teesside Crown Court but wasn\u2019t in a celebratory mood.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t feel I had anything to celebrate, it\u2019s been a tough year. I\u2019d say the rest of my life depended on this,\u2019 he explained.\n\nPaul was cleared last week (Picture: Reuters)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so thankful to the judge and the jury who saw common sense in all of this.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the seriousness of the allegations, Paul says he would still act the same way as he simply wanted to make the woman feel better about herself after the nasty comments regarding her appearance.\n\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever change. I am who I am. I just don\u2019t think it was right for her to be called what she was called, fat and ugly,\u2019 Paul admitted.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always been a nice, caring guy.\u2019\n\nHowever, he did state: \u2018Obviously I\u2019m more cautious, there are people out there trying to stab you in the back.\u2019\n\nPaul is now focusing on getting his life back on track and is working on a movie about his life.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
