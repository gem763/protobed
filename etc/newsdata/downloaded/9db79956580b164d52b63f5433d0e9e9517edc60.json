We will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019\n\nCBS News noted the Deir ez-Zur area has been held by \u201cabout 200 lightly armed troops\u201d from the United States who are working in concert with the SDF to keep the Islamic State from recapturing or sabotaging the oil fields, which were once a major source of revenue for the ISIS \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported the Trump administration \u201csees some benefit to Kurds being in control of the oil,\u201d since the battered remains of the Syrian oil industry have become a significant revenue source for the Kurds and has purchased them a degree of autonomy from the brutal government headquartered in Damascus and its patrons in Moscow:\n\nA quiet arrangement has existed between the Kurds and the Syrian government, whereby Damascus buys the surplus through middlemen in a profitable smuggling operation that has continued despite political differences. The Kurdish-led administration sells crude oil to private refiners, who use primitive homemade refineries to process fuel and diesel and sell it back to the administration. The oil was expected to be a bargaining chip for the Kurds to negotiate a deal with the Syrian government, which unsuccessfully tried to reach the oil fields to retake them from IS. With Trump saying he plans to keep forces to secure the oil, it seems the oil will continue to be used for leverage \u2014 with Moscow and Damascus.\n\nNBC News quoted a \u201csenior defense official\u201d who said both President Trump and Senate Republicans have been \u201cbriefed by Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the importance of securing the oil fields so they can\u2019t be seized and used to fund ISIS\u2019 terrorist activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to this official, U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Kenneth McKenzie is exploring \u201ca number of options\u201d for reinforcing the oil fields, possibly including air support.", "description": "The Pentagon seeks permission from the White House to deploy hundreds of U.S. troops and dozens of tanks to eastern Syria.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/US-Military-Tank-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
