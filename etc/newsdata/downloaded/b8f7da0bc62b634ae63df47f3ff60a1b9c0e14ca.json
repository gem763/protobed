Powered by French online survey firm Toluna, the survey shows 73% of German residents have completely rejected Libra, with 42% saying that they do not trust Facebook, while 31% of respondents noted that they only believe in centralized currencies.\n\nAlso on Thursday, BaFin's president Felix Hufeld expressed concerns over Libra, claiming that Facebook\u2019s planned cryptocurrency sees a number of unresolved questions and represents a parallel currency created privately.\n\nDespite existing concerns, global financial regulators are not planning to ban either Facebook\u2019s Libra or other stablecoins, ECB director Benoit Coeure said in an interview on Oct. 17. However, Coeure stressed that such initiatives will have to meet high regulatory standards prescribed by the ECB.", "description": "Cointelegraph presents a weekly digest of news from the German-speaking world, with help from Cointelegraph auf Deutsch", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZTc0NzNiZmExMjQ3NGUxMzc1YTNlMGNhNzdhNzVkYzMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
