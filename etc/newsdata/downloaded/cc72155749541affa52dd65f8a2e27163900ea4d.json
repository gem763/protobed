Ahead of the conference, the Turkish authorities stated that the journalist had been killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by Saudi agents.\n\nThe chief executives of several major firms \u2013 including HSBC, Standard Chartered and the London Stock Exchange \u2013 pulled out of last year's summit. But each of these firms, as well as US giants including JP Morgan and BlackRock, will be going this week \u2013 despite growing calls for an investigation into the Saudi crown prince's role in Khashoggi's death.\n\nLast month, Mohammad bin Salman maintained that he did not personally order the killing, but said he took responsibility for the tragedy as a Saudi leader. Meanwhile, prosecutors in the kingdom have put on trial 11 people who they allege were involved in the 'rogue operation'.\n\nDespite this backdrop, Standard Chartered chief executive Bill Winters and David Schwimmer, head of the London Stock Exchange, are expected to attend this year's forum. Sorrell and Gilbert, Standard Life Aberdeen's outgoing deputy chairman, are also set to attend.\n\nThe event was boycotted last year following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nOther City attendees are expected to include Schroders chairman Michael Dobson, former London Stock Exchange boss Xavier Rolet \u2013 who now leads London hedge fund CQS \u2013 and Noel Quinn, the interim chief executive of HSBC.\n\nAn HSBC spokesman said its involvement reflected the fact that it employed 4,000 staff in Saudi Arabia to 'support our customers as the country implements its economic reform and social development agenda'.\n\nA number of firms in attendance at the event will be hoping to play a role in the listing of Saudi Aramco, the nation's state oil company. The firm could be valued at up to $2trillion, making it the world's largest ever stock market flotation.\n\nBeyond the City, according to an event programme leaked to US website Axios, the summit is expected to be attended by former Prime Minister David Cameron, executives from Manchester United Football Club, SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son and popstar-cum-businessman Will.I.Am.", "description": "A clutch of the City's best known grandees, including Sir Martin Sorrell, are this week set to attend a Saudi Arabian investment conference that was boycotted last year.", "authors": ["William Turvill For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
