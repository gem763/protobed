The Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 132.52 points, or 1.7%, to finish at 7,865.\n\nWhat's driving the stock market?\n\nMarkets scored a modest lift after a pair of reports infused some optimism in the trading atmosphere.\n\nA report from Bloomberg News (link) indicated that China was open to a limited tariff resolution with the U.S., while a separate report from the Financial Times (link) (paywall) indicated that China has offered to increase by 50% purchases of agricultural products from U.S. farmers to $50 billion.\n\nThe reports come after, the U.S. State Department on Tuesday announced visa restrictions (link)on Chinese government and Communist Party officials who are believed to be involved in abuse of Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China. That announcement came after the U.S. blacklisted some 28 entities for the same alleged violations, prompting Beijing to reportedly consider rolling out its own visa restrictions on U.S. nationals, according to a Reuters (link).\n\nA representative from China's Ministry of Commerce said: \"We strongly urge the U.S. to immediately stop making irresponsible remarks on the issue of Xinjiang\" and demanded that the U.S. \"stop interfering\" in \"China's internal affairs, and remove relevant Chinese entities from the list of entities as soon as possible.\"\n\nImport duties on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods are set to be raised to a rate of 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.\n\nTrade animosities have been weighing on the market, driving stocks lower on Tuesday even after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the central bank believes the current economic expansion can be sustained, and that the Fed intends to expand its balance sheet by purchasing short-term U.S. government debt in exchange for bank reserves, in an attempt to quell recent stress in the market for overnight bank-to-bank lending.\n\nLater in the afternoon, minutes from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee's Sept. 17-18 meeting will be released at 2 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nBefore that release, investors will be watching for further comments from Powell, who is slated to host a round table on labor market conditions and local banking at 11 a.m. with Kansas City Fed President Esther George in Kansas City, one of three dissenters in last month's meeting.\n\nOn the data front, a reading on job openings will be released at 10 a.m. , and a report on wholesale trade will be released at the same time.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.551% from 1.532% late Tuesday.\n\nGold prices edged higher on Wednesday, with December bullion up $3.70, or 0.2%, to $1,507.30 an ounce, after settling at $1,503.90 an ounce on Tuesday.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery gained 49 cents, or 0.9%, to $53.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nIn Asia overnight Wednesday, trade was mixed, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.8% to 25,682.81, the China CSI 300 rose 0.1% to reach 3,843.24, and Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.2%. The Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.5%.\n\nRelated:European stocks drift lower on China worries and LSE stumbles (link)\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 09, 2019 06:41 ET (10:41 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
