The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial 'Caliphate,' will no longer be in the immediate area,\" the statement said.\n\nThe White House said because thousands of ISIS fighters and their families are being held in camps, \"the United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial 'Caliphate' by the United States.\"\n\nThe Pentagon was reportedly \"completely blindsided\" by the order.\n\nPentagon \u2018completely blindsided\u2019 by White House order to pull U.S. forces back from northern Syria green-lighting Turkish invasion: U.S. officials \u2014 Lucas Tomlinson (@LucasFoxNews) October 7, 2019\n\nThe decision to pull out of the region has been criticized and is being seen as abandoning the allied Kurds, who have fought alongside U.S. forces against ISIS, and are now at the mercy of the Turkish military.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted Monday morning if the \"press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making\" and he will work in the Senate to ask for a reversal of the order.\n\nAlso, if this plan goes forward will introduce Senate resolution opposing and asking for reversal of this decision. Expect it will receive strong bipartisan support. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019", "description": ".10/07/2019 16:03:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/247/ef67a9f4-4c98-4138-aaca-4ce46efae64c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
