Improvements in its machine learning model for identifying problematic tweets enabled the faster moderation, Twitter said.\n\nCracking down on abusive tweets has been an ongoing goal of Twitter\u2019s. The company regularly talks about how \u201cone of our highest priorities is to improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter,\u201d as its earnings letter says today. Ongoing abuse has made Twitter an unpleasant place to be for many longtime and highly active users, so its ability to cut down on bad actors is important to the site\u2019s usage and user growth.\n\n\u201cMore proactively and faster than before\u201d\n\nTwitter says its automated flagging has grown from 43 percent of all abusive tweets last quarter and 38 percent the quarter before that. To be clear: this doesn\u2019t represent every single abusive tweet on Twitter, just the ones that Twitter has ultimately removed as abusive. A problematic tweet that Twitter either missed or ultimately chose not to remove wouldn\u2019t count, while a tweet that was mistakenly removed as abuse would.\n\nThose are important caveats, but Twitter would at least like us to think that these numbers represent an overall improvement in moderation. Twitter says that it\u2019s also been sending more flagged tweets to human moderators for review and that reviews have been happening \u201cmore proactively and faster than before.\u201d More abusive content was taken down in total, too.\n\nAs it\u2019s said in the past, Twitter continues to acknowledge that it has more work to do on abuse and that its goal is to reduce \u201cthe burden on victims of abuse\u201d and to take \u201caction before abuse is reported.\u201d\n\nThe moderation numbers came in Twitter\u2019s latest earnings report, which also saw the company report adding 6 million new daily users during its third quarter. Twitter now has 145 million daily users, up from 124 million this time a year ago and 139 million last quarter.\n\nUser growth has been a big struggle for Twitter over the past couple of years, and today\u2019s numbers at least suggest that it\u2019s continuing to head in the right direction. They don\u2019t tell the full story, though: until recently, Twitter disclosed how many monthly users it had, rather than daily users, and that number was shrinking for a year straight up until the beginning of 2019.\n\nWhile Twitter\u2019s daily usage numbers are a lot rosier, they\u2019re still fairly small. Snapchat now has 210 million daily users, and as of the beginning of this year, Instagram had 500 million people just using Stories every day.\n\nTwitter claims part of the revenue miss was product related. I'm told it was this: Twitter was using personal data from some users to either target them with ads or measure the performance of ads in ways it wasn't supposed to. It stopped doing that in Aug. https://t.co/gOTRyJ4BHs \u2014 Kurt Wagner (@KurtWagner8) October 24, 2019\n\nDespite the generally positive user numbers, Twitter\u2019s stock is taking a serious hit on today\u2019s earnings report, with share price down almost 20 percent before market open. Twitter turned a profit again, but the company only reached $44 million, narrowly missing its guidance and falling from $92 million the same quarter last year. Revenue of $824 million also fell near the bottom of Twitter\u2019s projections.\n\nTwitter said a number of things were at fault for the weaker-than-hoped revenue, including bugs that limited its ability to target ads and share data with advertisers. Bloomberg reporter Kurt Wagner said Twitter\u2019s ability to target and measure ads fell significantly after the company stopped using data for advertising that users had not granted the company permission to use, as it had been doing in some cases for around a year. That mistake was disclosed in August.", "description": "Twitter says more than 50 percent of tweets identified as abusive are now being flagged by its automated moderation tools before a user reports them.
