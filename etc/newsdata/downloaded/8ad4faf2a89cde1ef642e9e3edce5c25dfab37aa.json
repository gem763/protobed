The locals have turned out in their thousands to embrace a sport which, according to a recent white paper, has only 100,000 registered rugby players in the country. For some comparison, volleyball has four times that number, football 10. In terms of attendance, the average rugby match in the domestic league draws crowds of around 5,000.\n\nUnderstandably, some have called the decision to bring the World Cup to these parts a gamble \u2013 one that, once the competition draws to a close and the pennies are counted, will backfire in the face of those faceless white collars focused on widening the financial net.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut look past such cynicism and a greater goal can be discerned. Inspiring, captivating, pulling in new fans, sparking a passion that previously wasn\u2019t there, expanding the sport beyond its traditional homelands \u2013 this can be the legacy of Japan 2019.\n\nSo far, the local fans have proved themselves to be as receptive and embracing as they come. Opposition shirts have been thrown on, selfies with rival fans taken, glasses of sake shared in the hot and sweaty izakayas that line the backstreets of Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Toyota and beyond.\n\nIn one instance, a group of Japanese supporters could be heard singing the Irish national anthem \u2013 with a helping hand from Google translate \u2013 before casually switching to the Flower of Scotland. For those of us more accustomed to the hostilities written into English sport\u2019s DNA, it was an utterly bizarre, but refreshing, sight. In all, it\u2019s made for an immersive, kaleidoscopic atmosphere that has been a joy to experience.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, of course, but there\u2019s no doubt things will heat up as the tournament rolls into the brutalities of knock-out rugby. When the vast majority of fans head home and the spotlight narrows on to a handful of teams, the dynamics will change. The pleasantries of the group stages will fade. Animosities may arise. Winning is all that will matter. When that happens, hopefully it\u2019s the voice of the locals that continues to shout the loudest.\n\nYours,\n\nSamuel Lovett\n\nSports reporter", "description": "The Rugby World Cup is only five days old but, for those caught up in its restless, neon-tinged flow, it already feels one of a kind.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/18/rugby-world-cup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
