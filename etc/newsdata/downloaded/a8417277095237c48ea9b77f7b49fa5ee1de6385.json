Its 185 mph maximum sustained winds are close to the highest ever observed in the Atlantic and it features textbook presentation from the vantage point of space.\n\nThe storm is nearly perfectly symmetrical, and a ring of towering thunderstorms surrounds its unmistakable eye. The clouds surrounding the eye exhibit a \u201cstadium effect\u201d expanding outward with altitude like a sports venue.\n\n\n\nHurricane Dorian at Category 5 intensity approaching the northwestern Bahamas early Sunday morning. (NOAA)\n\nDorian\u2019s winds are the strongest ever observed so far north in the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida. Its pressure, down to 911 millibars, is stronger than Hurricane Andrew\u2019s when it made landfall in south Florida in 1992. Only one Atlantic hurricane, since 1950 has had stronger winds than Dorian: Allen in 1980 with 190 mph winds.\n\n[\u2018Catastrophic\u2019 Hurricane Dorian unleashing devastating blow in northern Bahamas, takes aim at Southeast U.S.]\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has described Dorian\u2019s satellite appearance as \u201coutstanding,\u201d \u201cstunning\u201d and \u201cimpressive.\u201d Remarkably, the storm has maintained this textbook look since Saturday morning.\n\nWhile the storm has an incredible appearance from space, it is deadly serious as it slams the northern Bahamas where the National Hurricane Center expects \u201cextreme destruction.\u201d\n\n[Bahamas taking horrific direct hit from intense Category 5 Hurricane Dorian]\n\nDorian attained such exceptional strength through a process known as rapid intensification, in which its peak winds increased more than 35 mph in 24 hours. It started Friday as a Category 2 (with 105 mph winds), before becoming a high-end Category 4 (with 150 mph winds) Saturday and a Category 5 Sunday.\n\nHere are several more extraordinary views of the storm:\n\nFrightening yet mesmerizing close-up #GOESEast combined visible-infrared animation of the eye of Hurricane #Dorian making landfall on Great Abaco Island courtesy of @CIRA_CSU First part of loop is 30 second imagery, 2nd part is 1-minute imagery which is why it appears to speed up pic.twitter.com/3qSOAUwEeA \u2014 NWS Eastern Region (@NWSEastern) September 1, 2019\n\nCategory 5 Hurricane #Dorian is currently impacting portions of the Bahamas as seen by @NOAA's GOES East this afternoon.
