Iranian and Russian interests in the Middle East have been advanced by our decision. Are we so weak, and so inept diplomatically that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey? I believe that it is imperative that public hearings are held to answer these question, and I hope the Senate is able to conduct those hearings next week.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) provided his own stinging critique of these developments but oddly left Trump out of it entirely. How does one express such disdain for Trump\u2019s inanity while pretending as if the policy descended from the heavens rather than from the lips of an erratic, ethically deficient and unfit leader? You\u2019d think the leader of half of an equal branch of government would have a little more spine.\n\nAlas, silence in public and grumbling in private have become the standard response for many Republicans. The Post reported:\n\nIn interviews with more than 20 GOP lawmakers and congressional aides in the past 48 hours, many said they were repulsed by Trump\u2019s decision to host an international summit at his own resort and incensed by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission \u2014 later withdrawn \u2014 that U.S. aid to Ukraine was withheld for political reasons. Others expressed anger over the president\u2019s abandonment of Kurdish allies in Syria. . . . A few Republicans are starting to say they flat-out won\u2019t do it anymore \u2014 particularly the president\u2019s choice of his Trump National Doral Miami golf resort for next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit of world leaders, a selection that will benefit him financially.\n\nSaturday night, Trump abandoned his Doral gambit. But what of Trump\u2019s other efforts to direct business to his other resorts? Lawmakers could go on the record and specifically pass legislation barring such self-dealing. Don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nAD\n\nMany Americans are exasperated that these lawmakers remain so silent in public, so unwilling to state obvious truths. Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), who openly mulled impeachment, is the exception not the rule. Before Trump abandoned the idea of bringing the Group of Seven to his Doral Miami resort, Florida Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio actually celebrated the self-dealing, because it was to take place in their own state. The spinelessness is matched only by the lack of any moral core or sense of greater obligation to the country.\n\nAD\n\nThe Post reports that, \u201cRepublicans believe that Trump has made it harder for them to help him politically survive impeachment and win reelection.\" Impeachment, however, is not self-executing. It only becomes harder for Trump to survive impeachment if they stand up, denounce his conduct and vote to impeach and remove. Otherwise they remain as culpable as he is for the destruction of ethical standards and the rule of law.\n\nRepublicans who have figured out Trump\u2019s action are indefensible must openly declare their sentiments and urge his resignation. They need to explain to Americans\u2019 the seriousness of Trump\u2019s offenses and the danger in allowing him to continue in office. If Trump won\u2019t go voluntarily, they should proceed with bipartisan impeachment. In the meantime, Republicans should join Democrats in blocking Trump\u2019s stomach-turning financial corruption and begin public hearings on the Syria debacle.\n\nWe\u2019ve passed the time when Republicans can run from the press and constituents. Silence is assent, not an act of defiance.\n\nAD", "description": "Courage is a rare commodity", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jMzgWKvu3sMe_w9g_SqbRfZz6mM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DYDVKUXRHUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
