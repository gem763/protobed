Washington and the Vatican are celebrating 35 years of diplomatic ties.\n\nHis remarks also condemned human rights violations against religious people in Cuba, Syria, and Iran.\n\nSurvivors of the estimated thousands of concentration camps in Xinjiang, China\u2019s westernmost state, have testified to the Communist Party using Uighurs and other minorities as slaves, harvesting their organs to sell on the black market, torturing them, and forcing them to worship dictator Xi Jinping. The Chinese regime insists that the camps are \u201cvocational centers\u201d where wayward Muslims vulnerable to jihadist indoctrination learn job skills that keep them from becoming terrorists.\n\nPompeo opened his speech with the story of Zumrat Dawat, a Uighur woman who survived a Xinjiang concentration camp, saved because her husband, a Pakistani national, made the case an international one. Dawat testified to the horrors she experienced at the camp in New York last week, at a religious freedom event hosted alongside events at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cBefore she left the camp, she was forced to renounce her faith and promise not to speak about what had happened to her. Chinese officials monitored her family and forced them to eat pork,\u201d Pompeo recalled.\n\nHe noted that Dawat survived because \u201cshe wasn\u2019t alone. God was with her. And America was with her, too. It\u2019s what we do, and it\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\nPompeo applauded the nations of the world \u2013 few among them, notably, majority Muslim \u2013 for condemning China for its human rights abuses in Xinjiang. \u201cThey are standing up and speaking honestly about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re following the wisdom of Jesus: \u2018Be not afraid.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, each of us must gird ourselves for another battle in defense of human dignity and religious freedom,\u201d Pompeo stated. \u201cThe stakes today are arguably higher than they were even during the Cold War, because the threats to it are more diverse and more numerous.\u201d\n\nHe noted that over 80 percent of the world lives under a regime that represses political freedom, or under threat of attack from religious radicals. He lay most of the blame for this situation on authoritarian states.\n\n\u201cBecause when the state rules absolutely, God becomes an absolute threat to authority. That\u2019s why Cuba cancelled National Catholic Youth Day back in August. \u2026 That\u2019s why Assad kills his own people \u2026 That\u2019s why the Islamic Republic of Iran has jailed, tortured, and killed thousands of its own citizens for four decades,\u201d Pompeo asserted.\n\nHe concluded by calling the Trump administration the \u201cstrongest advocates of religious freedom in the history of our country\u201d and urging nations of the world to join the administration in challenging human rights violators to stop committing crimes against people of faith.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry and state propaganda agencies typically respond rapidly to condemnation of China\u2019s gross human rights abuses. As Tuesday was the anniversary of the founding of communist China, however, the national holiday has kept Beijing from responding at press time.\n\nThe Pentagon estimated in May that as many as 3 million people \u2013 most Muslim Uighurs, but in some cases dissident Christians, as well \u2013 were at the time languishing in concentration camps in Xinjiang. Survivors say the regime forces them to learn Mandarin and abandon their native Uighur language, memorize Communist Party propaganda and songs worshipping Xi Jinping, eat pork to violate Islamic law, and work in sweatshops making clothing, some of which has been sold in America.\n\nMore recently released survivors say that Chinese government agents do a complete health scan to check if their organs are useable in transplants; China has for years engaged in live organ harvesting using political prisoners to make money on the black market, many reports have revealed.\n\nDawat, the woman Pompeo highlighted in his speech, told Radio Free Asia (RFA) that she endured a complete organ scan and thorough health check before being interned in her concentration camp.\n\n\u201c[F]irst they took me to a hospital, and that is what they do, first take you to a hospital. Only after they removed the black hood from over my head did I realize I was in a hospital,\u201d she explained. \u201cI saw police in uniform everywhere, also people wearing white coats walking about, so I guessed that I was in a hospital. \u2026 they drew blood samples first, then X-Rayed my internal organs.\u201d\n\nAfter the health scan, Dawat said that Chinese police drugged her every day, which made her \u201cnumb emotionally.\u201d She also said the drugs appeared to prevent menstruation, suggesting they had contraceptive properties. She also described a forced sterilization surgery:\n\nOn the day of my operation, I was taken inside the operating room, all I remember was that I was given an infusion. When I opened my eyes, I found myself in a long corridor, along with seven or eight other women. There was no medical staff, doctors or nurses. It was a very cold day, and I was covered with only a thin bed sheet. No one was allowed to visit from outside. When I looked around I heard other women moaning from pain. Once the effect of the anaesthetic wore off, I felt a sharp pain in my lower abdominal. My husband wanted to be with me that day, but they refused. No family members were allowed to accompany anyone.\n\nThe Communist Party describes the camps as necessary to \u201csave the people who are deceived by or even have joined terrorist forces,\u201d even though Beijing has not offered any evidence that those imprisoned have ties to terrorist groups.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Fighting China's egregious violations of human rights is \"what we do, and who we are,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/xinjiang-china-muslim-indoctrination-camp.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
