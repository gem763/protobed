(AP) - Peyton Huslig threw for 315 yards and four touchdowns and Missouri State earned its first win in almost a year beating Western Illinois 37-31 in triple overtime on Saturday.\n\nThe Bears (1-3, 1-0 Missouri Valley) hadn\u2019t won since Oct. 13, 2018 when they beat Indiana State 29-26. The following week, Western Illinois beat the Bears 31-14 which started their eight-game skid.\n\nKendall Stewart\u2019s 22-yard touchdown run - half of it tip-toeing down the sideline - put Missouri State ahead 37-31. The 2-point conversion failed. Western Illinois (0-5, 0-1) turned it over on downs to end the game.\n\nMax Norris\u2019 1-yard TD run for the Leathernecks with 65 seconds to play in regulation tied it at 21. Norris finished with two rushing scores.\n\nThe Leathernecks own a seven-game losing streak and haven\u2019t won since Nov. 3 last year when they beat Southern Illinois 34-31.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Peyton Huslig threw for 315 yards and four touchdowns and Missouri State earned its first win in almost a year beating Western Illinois 37-31 in triple overtime on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
