Giuffre has alleged that sex offender and financier Epstein trafficked her to powerful men for sex, including Minsky, who died in 2016. She\u2019s alleged that Epstein and his alleged madam Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her at Mar-a-Lago when she was 16 years old.\n\nStallman wrote that \u201cthe most plausible scenario\u201d for Giuffre\u2019s accusations was that she was, in actuality, \u201centirely willing.\u201d Vice\u2019s Motherboard later reprinted the emails in full. Gano did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStallman also wrote in the email exchange that \u201cit is morally absurd to define \u2018rape\u2019 in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.\u201d\n\nA deep dive into his writings shows this isn\u2019t the first time Stallman has expressed such questionable views, however. He has written dozens of posts on his personal website in favor of legalizing pedophilia and child pornography for more than 15 years.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018child pornography\u2019 might be a photo of yourself or your lover that the two of you shared. It might be an image of a sexually mature teenager that any normal adult would find attractive. What\u2019s heinous about having such a photo?\u201d Stallman wrote in 2011 on his personal site, stallman.org, in an argument in favor of Congress limiting laptop searches at the U.S. border.\n\nStallman currently works as a visiting scientist at MIT, according to the website of the university\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), and as the president of the Free Software Foundation, which he founded in 1985. Stallman has been seen as a pioneering computer scientist for decades, especially in his creation of and advocacy for new kinds of freely available software. Much of his work underpins modern computer science. He\u2019s worked at MIT on and off since the 1980s, and he spoke at a Microsoft computer science research center just last week. The Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, and MIT did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Stallman\u2019s remarks.\n\nStallman also did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast.\n\nStallman commented on the news of Epstein at length on his personal site. In April of this year, the programmer wrote of one story, \u201cI disagree with some of what the article says about Epstein. Epstein is not, apparently, a pedophile, since the people he raped seem to have all been postpuberal.\u201d He preferred to call Epstein a \u201cserial rapist.\u201d\n\nChafing at the idea of a legal age of consent was a favorite theme of his, per his earlier blog posts. In 2003, he said, \u201cI think that everyone age 14 or above ought to take part in sex, though not indiscriminately. (Some people are ready earlier.)\u201d\n\nAlan Dershowitz, one of the lawyers who helped broker Epstein\u2019s 2008 sweetheart plea deal, has also argued against age of consent laws, calling statutory rape an \u201coutdated concept\u201d in a 1997 op-ed and suggesting on Twitter in July that a 16-year-old should have the \u201cconstitutional right\u201d to consensual sex.\n\nStallman was apparently also quite open about his ideas not only on age of consent laws, but also pedophilia. In 2006, he wrote, \u201cI am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren't voluntary, which are then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing.\u201d The law does not allow for \u201cvoluntary\u201d pedophilia.\n\nIn 2006, he said it wouldn\u2019t so bad for an adult man who worked for the Department of Homeland Security to have sex with a 14-year-old, as onethe government employee had allegedly propositioned: \u201csupposing she had voluntarily had sex with him, presuming that they used a condom and suitable contraception, it would have done no harm to either of them.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated his point in 2013: \u201cThere is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts children.\u201d\n\nPeople within the tech industry knew of Stallman\u2019s remarks, chattering about his controversial claims in social networking sites and forums at least since last year, but his remarks about Epstein\u2019s victims reignited the debate Friday. The digital trail of Stallman\u2019s remarks and the whisper network surrounding them raise the question of whether MIT and the Free Software Foundation knew of his controversial statements.\n\nStallman\u2019s permissive streak extended to all varieties of illegal sexual behavior. In 2003, he wrote a post about a judge who argued that repealing an Alabama anti-sodomy law would lead to the legalization of \"prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia.\u201d The computer scientist responded, \u201cAll of these acts should be legal as long as no one is coerced. They are illegal only because of prejudice and narrowmindedness.\u201d\n\nStallman extended his argument to say that internet censorship is worse than child pornography: \u201cThe term \u2018child pornography\u2019 is dishonest. The censorship of it puts young lovers in direct danger of prosecution. Many published works are disgusting, but censorship is more so.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2011: \u201cEven when it is uncontroversial to call the subject depicted a \u2018child,\u2019 that is no excuse for censorship. Having a photo or drawing does not hurt anyone, so and [sic] if you or I think it is disgusting, that is no excuse for censorship.\u201d\n\nMIT has been rocked in recent weeks by scandals arising from its connections to Epstein. The director of the vaunted MIT Media Lab, Joichi Ito, resigned after the New Yorker reported he accepted more money from Epstein than he disclosed and that he had concealed the donations from both the university and the public. The President of MIT, L. Rafael Reif, ordered an independent investigation, which revealed that he, too, had taken part in hiding Epstein\u2019s donations. Reif is facing calls to step down after acknowledging that the Media Lab accepted funds from Epstein long after his 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution, with Reif\u2019s own signature found on a 2012 note thanking Epstein for his generosity to the university.", "description": "MIT bigwig Richard Stallman dismissed Epstein\u2019s underage victims in emails and defended child pornography on his blog.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568423530/190913-Montgomery-Richard-Stallman-tease_dgmmix", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
