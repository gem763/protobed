But my head falls in shame when we as a nation do not reciprocate the same. What can be more painful for the family of a fallen soldier, apart from the fact that their child is no longer alive? More painful is the fact and the fight to get your child the due honour and justice they duly deserve but have been deprived of. There are two stories of our brave sons which make me restless. One is of Capt Saurabh Kalia and his father\u2019s struggle to get justice and the other is of Major Akshay Girish and his mother\u2019s fight for her son\u2019s honour. Both are equally heartbreaking.\n\nWhile Mr. Kalia fights for justice and harsh punishment for the Pakistani perpetrators who mutilated Saurabh\u2019s body- his eyes were gouged and punctured, bones and teeth were broken, nails ripped off, face brutally assaulted. All this father of the slain soldier wants is that the govt takes up the issue with Pakistan for audaciously violating the Geneva Convention and punishment for the criminals of this crime. As per him, 20 years and 500 letters later, he is yet to get a positive response from the government. When asked Ministry of Defence says it can only put pressure on the Ministry of External Affairs to take up this issue with Pakistan.\n\nMeghna Girish, mother of Major Akshay Girish, who was among seven soldiers killed in a terror attack on an Army camp in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir, in November 2016 is fighting for her martyred son\u2019s honour. The Commanding Officer of Major Akshay Girish\u2019s regiment had sent a recommendation for Shaurya Chakra for his gallant act, but what Major Girsh received was just \u201cMention In despatches\u201d\n\nThe Shaurya Chakra as we all know is the Indian Army\u2019s third-highest peacetime award while Mention in Despatches is just a name for an official report mentioning a soldier\u2019s bravado in an attack. Hurt and deeply anguished Mrs Girish has been fighting hard, not for the award but for the explanation from the concerned authorities, as to why it was refused to her brave son, since his immediate seniors who were present at the place of action, had recommended it for him.\n\nThe angst, the anguish and the apprehension of these parents are both justifiable and legitimate. Imagine losing your child fighting for the nation and then fighting a long arduous battle to retain their honour. The pain is indescribable, as is the fact that there is no word in any language in the world for the parents who have lost their children, because of the enormity of the loss. Sanskrit word Vilomah comes closest which means, \u201cagainst the natural order\u201d but even this word fails to sum up a parent\u2019s pain. Such is their grief.\n\nAdd to this pain, the fight, the request, the appeals to the govt authorities for justice of their slain soldier son. There could be instances where a not so deserving act gets recognized and given the due honour, for whatever reasons. But the shame is on us that we fail to recognise these gallant soldiers in the way they deserved.\n\nMy question to the government of India is, isn\u2019t the supreme sacrifice by a soldier a reason enough for you to give them suitable honors? Why can\u2019t we just step aside for a while and work towards bringing these parents some solace? It is hard to understand why these cases, which should have been simply resolved, have been made so complicated.\n\nMy question to the top brass of the Indian army, is, why do we lack the capability and capacity to challenge the issues related to our soldiers who have made the supreme sacrifice? Doesn\u2019t it indicate your profound institutional failure? Are you not answerable to these parents?\n\nThis has been the most painful piece to write. It has been there in my heart for months, I started writing it for Kargil Diwas, but every time the heart got too heavy, eyes went moist & throat choked.\n\nThese sons of our soil have taken the final call in their line of duty and have moved to the last post, the least we can do is to help them get due justice and recognition.\n\nJai Hind!", "description": "I salute the parents who instill values in their children which puts the nation above self to the extent of supreme sacrifice.
