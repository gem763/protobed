Quebec will follow suit, said Lionel Carmant, the province's junior health minister.\n\n\"The government wants to attain the level set out by Health Canada, and what's more, work toward the safest level possible \u2014 no lead,\" he said.\n\nThe government originally intended to change the provincial standard by spring 2020, but Environment Minister Benoit Charette said it will be done sooner, making Quebec the first province to do so.\n\nCarmant, Charette, Municipal Affairs Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest and Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, all spoke at a news conference in Quebec City Wednesday and stressed the province's drinking water supply is good quality.\n\nHoracio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, Lionel Carmant, junior health minister, Environment Minister Benoit Charette and Municipal Affairs Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest all stressed there's nothing wrong with Quebec's drinking water. (Sylvain Roy Roussel/CBC)\n\nThe issue is with the pipes \u2014 lead is usually found in drinking water after leaching from a home or building's plumbing system. Exposure to the metal can have effects on neurological development and behaviour in children, and lead to increased blood pressure or kidney problems in adults.\n\nThe government wants municipalities across Quebec to come up with plans to reduce the levels of lead in the water supply. Those plans must include:\n\nDetermining the neighbourhoods with homes that are most likely to have a lead service pipe, and a timetable for identifying those sectors.\n\nFiguring out how long it will take to replace all lead service entrances.\n\nEvaluating how much the process will cost.\n\nComing up with a way to prioritize the work.\n\nThe testing method, which currently involves running water for five minutes before sampling, will also be changed, Carmant said.\n\nNow, water samples will be collected right when the tap is turned on, and again after a stagnation period of 30 minutes.\n\nThe Education Ministry will use the same standards to evaluate drinking water in schools, Carmant said. Earlier this month, Education Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge ordered every public and private school in the province to test the drinking water for lead.\n\nThis summer, Quebec's public health research institute (INSPQ) made public a study that found 16 per cent of schools in Montreal have at least one faucet or water fountain contaminated by lead, findings that were corroborated.", "description": "In March, Health Canada cut the\u00a0acceptable concentration of lead in drinking water from 10 micrograms per litre to five micrograms per litre.
