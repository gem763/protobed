That he had to be avoided at all costs.'\n\nVester is the founder of Silence Breakers Alliance, which funds non profit organizations that are working toward ending sexual harassment in the workplace\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSpeaking out: Matt Lauer 'had to be avoided at all costs' said Linda Vester (above) in an interview while calling on NBC news to launch an external investigation\n\nVester also called on the network to launch an external investigation in the wake of these allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n'I think Ronan Farrow's meticulous reporting is showing that NBC was not honest when it conducted its own internal investigation of sexual misconduct,' said Vester.\n\n'In fact, they just really didn't get to the bottom of it at all. They didn't interview enough women. And we don't have the truth yet. And it seems that the cover-up continues at NBC News.'\n\nThis is not the first time Vester has called on NBC to hire investigators outside the company.\n\nShe made the same remarks almost one year ago as well, but that was before the release of Farrow's book Catch and Kill.\n\nVester was appearing on Tucker Carlson Tonight at the time, the show which Megyn Kelly coincidentally appeared on Wednesday as well to also call for an external investigation.\n\nVester was a war correspondent for NBC in the 1990s who went on to host Weekend Today before leaving for Fox News.\n\nShe told The Washington Post and Variety magazine in 2017 that Tom Brokaw forcibly tried to kiss her on two occasions, first in 1994 and then again in 1995.\n\nThat timeline means that both of those alleged incidents occurred while Brokaw was the network's star anchor.\n\nHours after the story was published, Brokaw fired off an email to staff members at NBC denying her allegations.\n\n'My lawyer read it out loud to me, and my first reaction was, \"Was he drunk when he wrote that?\"' said Vester.\n\n'It sounded like someone who\u2019s up at four in the morning writing some angry, drunken screed. It took a while for it to settle in just how misogynistic and malicious it was.'\n\nThings only got worse when multiple women at the network jumped to Brokaw's defense.\n\n'Not only did it hurt me personally, I thought it did such damage to every other woman who was trying to summon the courage to come forward,' said Vetser of the letter, which was signed by approximately 100 female employees at NBC.\n\n'Some people who I had worked with - one of whom had called herself my mentor - had signed that letter. I was also very disappointed in Rachel Maddow.'\n\nShe said that this behavior hurt the movement, calling out a few of the bigger names who signed that letter.\n\n'What I think the women in power at NBC News \u2014 like Savannah Guthrie and Mika Brzezinski and Rachel Maddow \u2014 [should do] is call for a real investigation,' stated Vester.\n\n'It\u2019s one thing for them to be marketed as female power and all for the sisterhood. But they\u2019re not using their megaphone to make women truly safe.'\n\nClaims: 'And let me tell you, from having worked at NBC News for nearly a decade, everybody knew, we all knew Matt was dangerous,' said Vester\n\nThat letter did not stop Vester from continuing to share her story however, or Brokaw's lawyer from making threats.\n\n'I guess we\u2019re going to war,' said attorney Reid Weingarten after she gave interviews to ABC and CNN.\n\nWeingarten would only say that he behaved 'professionally' and that he does not recall De Niro's name ever coming up in conversation.\n\n'Those threats were what really caused rolling panic attacks,' said Vester.\n\n'It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a shrinking violet. I used to report from war zones.'\n\nBrokaw initially said that he met Vester twice, 'both at her request' because she wanted career advice.\n\n'The meetings were brief, cordial and appropriate, and despite Linda's allegations, I made no romantic overtures towards her at that time or any other,' he said in a statement.\n\nThen came the letter, in which Brokaw declared: 'My family and friends are stunned and supportive. My NBC colleagues are bewildered that Vester, who had limited success at NBC News, a modest career at Fox and a reputation as a colleague who had trouble with the truth was suddenly the keeper of the flame of journalistic integrity.'", "description": "Linda Vester said in an interview on Wednesday that Lauer was 'dangerous' and a 'problem' at NBC when she worked there over 20 years ago, leading her to wonder how execs could be unaware", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19847102-0-image-a-4_1571330746514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
