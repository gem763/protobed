Biden.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2014 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it,\u201d freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Saturday night.\n\nThe New York Democrat has clashed with party leadership before, but this time her squad looked a little different. Pelosi ally Rep. Jared Huffman and 2020 Democratic hopefuls Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro joined her in laying the blame at leadership\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cAfter the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in U.S. elections,\u201d Ms. Warren tweeted.\n\n\u201cDo your constitutional duty and impeach the president.\u201d\n\nOther House Democrats aren\u2019t going so far as to blame leadership, but they are fanning the flames of impeachment \u2014 saying the president\u2019s latest alleged misdeed is past the point of no return.\n\n\u201cWe may very well have crossed the Rubicon here,\u201d Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN this weekend.\n\nAt the core of the latest uptick in impeachment fervor are allegations that Mr. Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the business dealings of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nA government whistleblower report detailing the alleged interaction has been blocked from Congress, sparking accusations of obstruction from Democrats.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged that he discussed Mr. Biden, a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, in his conversation with Mr. Zelenskiy but denied using aid money as leverage to pressure the foreign government into cooperating with an investigation.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have argued that if they don\u2019t move forward on impeachment now, Mr. Trump would be virtually untouchable.\n\n\u201cWe are in a constitutional crisis,\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a House Judiciary Committee member, tweeted Monday. \u201cAt the core of all of this is not the question of what happens if we move forward with impeachment, it\u2019s the question of what happens if we do NOT move forward.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the rare move Sunday to address both Democrats and Republicans in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter urging acting National Intelligence Director Joesph Maguire to turn over the whistleblower report to Congress by Thursday.\n\nShould the deadline not be met or the administration intervened, Mrs. Pelosi threatened to up the ante without using the I-word.\n\n\u201cIf the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of the investigation,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer backed up her position Monday, urging his Republican colleagues in the Senate to end their \u201csee no evil\u201d act and join Democrats calling for the report.\n\nBut with growing calls for impeachment fueling the latest push, there is a question of how much patience the Democratic Party has.\n\n\u201c[Pelosi] gave [Mr. Maguire] a deadline of Thursday,\u201d Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro said in an interview with NPR Monday. \u201cIf he\u2019s not forthcoming, I think we should start impeachment on Friday before we leave town.\u201d\n\nIn light of the new accusations against the president, at least two swing-state Democrats \u2014 Reps. Angie Craig and Dean Phillips of Minnesota \u2014 endorsed moving forward with impeachment, should the reports of pressuring Ukraine prove true.\n\n\u201cWhen there is an abuse of power of this magnitude, it is our responsibility to stand up for what is right. That is why I am calling to open impeachment proceedings \u2014 immediately, fairly, and impartially,\u201d Ms. Craig wrote in a statement.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
