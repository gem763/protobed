It was a crazy experience back then and you're right, look at every single show now, it's pretty amazing,' Smith said.\n\nHis new show Riverdale has a gay character, Kevin, played by Casey Cott, who is quite similar to McPhee.\n\n'There's always a gay storyline, a lesbian storyline or whatever. I was talking to Casey and he's playing pretty much the same character I played on Dawson's,' he said.\n\nHistory: 'We were the first ones to do that. It was a crazy experience back then and you're right, look at every single show now, it's pretty amazing,' Smith said\n\nSmith added that he felt a 'huge' responsibility to get the character right, while discussing his conversations with Dawson's Creek creator Kevin Williamson.\n\n'I remember the day Kevin Williamson came down to Wilmington, North Carolina ... He said, 'Kerr, let's go get some coffee,'\" said Smith.\n\n'I went, \"Oh no, am I fired?\" And he throws this idea, \"We want to go down a different avenue with Jack,\" and I go, \"What does that mean?\"'\n\nResponsibility: Smith added that he felt a 'huge' responsibility to get the character right, while discussing his conversations with Dawson's Creek creator Kevin Williamson\n\nSmith added that Williamson 'always had the intention of making one of his characters gay,' adding that Williamson himself was still in the closet.\n\nIronically, Smith's gay kiss story line was handled by Greg Berlanti, who would go on to executive produce Riverdale.\n\n'My storyline ended up being largely Greg Berlanti's. It was an intense experience and I remember calling everybody I respected and said, \"Hey should I do this?\"'\n\nCloset: Smith added that Williamson 'always had the intention of making one of his characters gay,' adding that Williamson himself was still in the closet\n\n'Doing the first male-male kiss, I remember it was intense. I'm glad we did it and it was part of history,' Smith added.\n\nThe cast reunited last year for a 20th anniversary cover story for Entertainment Weekly, with Smith adding he hadn't seen Katie Holmes or Michelle Williams in quite some time.\n\nSmith makes his debut as Principal Honey on Wednesday night's new episode of Riverdale.", "description": "Just ahead of his debut on The CW's Riverdale, Kerr Smith is opening up about the importance of his gay Dawson's Creek character Jack McPhee.", "authors": ["Brian Gallagher For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/06/19821892-0-image-a-11_1571290228311.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
