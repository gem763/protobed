Hillary LeBeau is a 30-year-old lawyer who just started cooking with meal kits and has taken improv classes. (Daniele Seiss/For The Washington Post)\n\n\"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?\" So asks the shepherdess Phebe, in Shakespeare's \"As You Like It.\" And so asks every person who has gone on a first date and came away thinking, \"Meh?\"\n\nShakespeare\u2019s question poses something of a predicament for daters and an existential quandary for Date Lab. If a first date lacks magic, is there no hope? Are there people for whom first dates are always hopeless \u2014 people better suited to romance that arrives gradually with a classmate, colleague, acquaintance or friend?\n\nThese are ominous questions to ask in a column about blind dates. But they\u2019re the questions raised by the date between Tom Keefe and Hillary LeBeau, both 30.\n\nTom, who works at a political consulting firm, applied for Date Lab at the behest of co-workers, even though he told me he usually doesn\u2019t like people when he first meets them: \u201cThat\u2019s just who I am. Once I get to know them, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re fine.\u2019 So I\u2019m always aware of that.\u201d He was gently self-deprecating but completely earnest, which would have been charming if he weren\u2019t delivering this information the morning after a blind date I had arranged for him. \u201cI would say 80 percent of people prove me wrong within the first 15 minutes and I end up liking them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his Date Lab profile, he listed his type as \u201ctall, driven, sense of humor, good conversationalist.\u201d So, I set him up with Hillary, a tall, driven, union-side labor lawyer. Hillary told me she signed up for Date Lab because \u201cit just sounded so funny and cool to me.\u201d Laughing, she added, \u201cAnd I like attention? That sounds terrible. But when I told my co-workers that I was doing it, they were all obsessed,\u201d egging her on just as Tom\u2019s workplace cheer squad had. Ever the lawyer, Hillary prepared for the date by studying Date Lab precedent. Reading old columns \u201cactually made me kind of nervous because they\u2019re all like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re well matched, we had a lot to talk about, but there was no spark.\u2019 That\u2019s what everyone says: \u2018There\u2019s no spark.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWe sent them to Pearl Dive Oyster Palace near Logan Circle. Asked for his first impression of Hillary, Tom said, \u201cShe\u2019s not my type.\u201d Why? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just felt, \u2018This isn\u2019t my type.\u2019 \u201d Hillary\u2019s first impression: \u201cHe\u2019s a normal-looking guy.\u201d More prone than Tom to find silver linings, Hillary speculated that normal-looking might be better than good-looking: \u201cIf he\u2019d been super hot or something, I\u2019d be very intimidated.\u201d\n\nTrue to the Date Lab pattern Hillary had identified, they did have a lot to talk about. Over salmon and fish tacos, they discussed the Democratic presidential debates that had taken place earlier that week. Both liked Sen. Elizabeth Warren and were curious about Sen. Kamala Harris. Both were anti-Bernie Sanders and skeptical of former vice president Joe Biden. That kind of agreement, on a first date, seemed like a good sign to Hillary: \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to see where you land on [politics], and it seems like his opinions were compatible with mine.\u201d When Hillary said she was from North Carolina, Tom told her that he once lived there for six months to work on a Democratic campaign \u2014 another moment of political synchronicity.\n\nBut their feelings were not in sync. \u201cThere were no awkward silences or lulls,\u201d said Hillary, concluding that the conversational element of the date had been a success. Tom, however, found the pace of conversation off-putting: \u201cI react to nervous situations by being very subdued,\u201d he said. He prefers dates who let awkward moments pass quietly: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to fill every hole in the conversation.\u201d\n\nFrom Hillary\u2019s point of view, Tom \u201cgot kind of cagey\u201d near the end of the date. She interpreted this as uncertainty about how to end the night: \u201cI go on a lot of dates, so I\u2019m really good at defusing awkwardness and just jumping into it, and jumping out of it, and expressing, \u2018I want to go home,\u2019 or \u2018Do you want to go somewhere next?\u2019 \u201d Unfortunately, she did not pick up on Tom\u2019s preference for comfortable silence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say there was no spark, but there was no spark,\u201d a reluctant Hillary admitted. Still, she chose not to completely close the door on the possibility of \u2014 something. \u201cA lot of times I\u2019m really surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be somebody that I\u2019ve hung out with a few times,\u201d and felt nothing for. \u201cAnd then they\u2019ll do or say something where I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh! You\u2019re cool. I want to be with you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs for Tom, he tried to be mindful of his tendency to recoil from the new. On first dates he often reminds himself, \u201cI have to be slow, and then see what happens. Be nice. You may actually end up really liking them.\u201d But, he said, Hillary \u201cnever made it into the 80 percent of people I end up liking.\u201d\n\nRate the date\n\nTom: 3 [out of 5]. \u201cIt was fine.\u201d\n\nHillary: 3. \u201cAverage.\u201d\n\nUpdate\n\nNo further contact.\n\nMaureen O\u2019Connor is a writer in New York.\n\nMore from Date Lab:\n\nForget happily ever after.
