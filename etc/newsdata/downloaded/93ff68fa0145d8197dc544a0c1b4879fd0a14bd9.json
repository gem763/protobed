Why not let voters decide about Trump?", "language": "en", "text": "We are watching a public execution.\n\nFueled with prejudice and injustice it should disgust all who still hold onto the faint belief that truth and the rule of law still count for something.\n\nPushed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her political vigilantes, the move to impeach a sitting president this week for things that never happened \u2013 a \u201cquid\u201d without a \u201cpro quo\u201d \u2013 insults our Constitution and subjects America to well-deserved ridicule from the rest of the planet.\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ: REP. ADAM SCHIFF HAS PROVEN HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED \u2013 SHOULDN'T BE INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIR\n\nThe assault by a Democratic speaker on a president she abhors was so transparent she indicted him before seeing any evidence, smeared him before hearing any proof, then executed him in the press without any concern for due process.\n\nIt all reminds one of Alice in Wonderland, where the Queen corrected the King\u2019s sense of jurisprudence when she insisted \u201cno, no\u2026sentence first \u2013 verdict afterword.\u201d\n\nThen, with a straight face, Nancy Pelosi had the gall to look us square in the eye and say this has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with her disdain for President Donald Trump, nothing to do with her inability to control Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her liberal arsonists who are out to torch the system (and the speaker's leadership).\n\nSeriously?\n\nAnd just when we thought we had seen the final episode of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what we know.\n\nOur president called Ukraine\u2019s president to congratulate him on his party\u2019s parliamentary victory. That\u2019s what leaders do when other leaders have a good day.\n\nThere was no quid pro quo, no trading of promised military aid for political help, no pressure or demand that Ukraine act \u2013 or else!\n\nDuring that call, confirmed by release of the transcript of that conversation, the president briefly referenced the dropped investigation of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s son, over allegations the vice president may have unfairly influenced an investigation there, and further asked for help in learning more about how corruption from abroad threatened America\u2019s electoral system.\n\nThere was no quid pro quo, no trading of promised military aid for political help, no pressure or demand that Ukraine act \u2013 or else!\n\nThe Democrats, even before knowing any of this, said Donald Trump is clearly guilty of the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d standard for impeachment contained in Article 1, Section 2, of the United States Constitution.\n\nThe president\u2019s crime?\n\nHe won the 2016 election.\n\nHis offense? He\u2019s doing what he promised, by taking on a system that threatens the middle class, domestic tranquility and national security.\n\nHis sin?\n\nDonald Trump has led America to its best economic report card in decades.\n\nAt the same time, the president took on China for abusing trade, Venezuela for abusing its people, and \u201cterrorist-central\u201d Iran for bombing Saudi Arabia.\n\nPelosi and her henchmen didn\u2019t want to hear any of that.\n\nInstead, they promoted a political lynching they were denied when the 674-day Mueller investigation proved no wrongdoing and the Kavanaugh nomination was approved. Choreographed for effect, they went ballistic over an allegation without waiting to see it, read it or vet it, as if facts and evidence were some inconvenience, some technical points to be addressed later.\n\nHere\u2019s the worst part.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf the Democrats\u2019 assault on the president goes unchallenged, there will be more investigations, more political witch hunts, and more impeachments. If you don\u2019t like something, investigate. If you don\u2019t agree with someone, accuse. If all that fails, call for impeachment.\n\nThis is rich, coming from a Congress whose approval ratings are at historic lows, from partisans whose electoral futures are in doubt, and from a House speaker so uncertain about her standing among Democrats she\u2019s willing to gamble, risk it all, to take out a president before the people of America weigh in next year wielding their most powerful weapon: the right to vote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNancy Pelosi wants to impeach our president.\n\nMore than ever, the American people want to impeach everyone responsible for putting their survival over ours.", "description": "The move to impeach a sitting president for things that never happened insults our Constitution.", "authors": ["Adam Goodman", "Adam Goodman Is An Award-Winning National Republican Media Strategist Who Has Advised Rudy Giuliani", "John Mccain", "Jeb Bush.
