They never dropped their heads.\"\n\nOn Saturday, French international fullback Thomas Ramos, who was sent home from the World Cup with what was judged to be a tournament-ending ankle injury, used his \"desire and frustration\" to help Toulouse to a 36-15 win over Castres.\n\nRamos was injured during France's 33-9 win over the United States on October 2 and subsequently ruled out of the remainder of the World Cup in Japan where Les Bleus have since reached the quarter-finals.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, he played the full 80 minutes, seemingly with no ill-effects as Toulouse swept to a\n\n\"He had a lot of desire and a lot of frustration,\" said Toulouse backs coach Clement Poitrenaud.\n\n\"When you have a player of his level and he is available, then you do not ask yourself if he should be playing or not.\"\n\nRamos was happy to enjoy a low-key return to the starting line-up.\n\nDespite being his club's top scorer from last season, he ceded kicking duties to Australian teammate Zack Holmes who booted 21 points, including converting his team's three tries.\n\nSaturday's win was the third of the Top 14 season for 20-time champions Toulouse, who had started the weekend second from bottom of the table.\n\nLyon stay top thanks to a 27-8 win over Pau that allowed them to claim a seventh win in seven games.\n\nPromoted Bayonne are third following a 28-24 win over Montpellier, the Basques' fifth victory in seven games.\n\nLa Rochelle celebrated a 50th straight sold-out home league match by running in five tries to beat Brive 41-17.\n\nRacing 92's woes continued when a 27-27 draw with Agen left Laurent Travers's side with a record of just one home win in four outings at their La Defense Arena.\n\nRacing could have won it with the game's last piece of meaningful action but Sam Hidalgo-Clyne's ambitious 50-metre penalty attempt sailed wide.", "description": "Heyneke Meyer's Stade Francais claimed an important French Top 14 win over Toulon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7834/08af8e154d11487abf964c4ac75a9933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
