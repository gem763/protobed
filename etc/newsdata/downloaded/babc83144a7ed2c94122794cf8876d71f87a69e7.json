Source: a video screenshot, Youtube, Guardian News\n\nRegulators on both sides of the Atlantic are taking very different approaches to Facebook\u2019s Libra project \u2013 with American politicians hoping to strong-arm the social network and Libra partners, while British central bank officials have laid out a roadmap for the forthcoming token.\n\nAmerica\u2019s House Financial Services Committee has summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to a hearing on October 23, per a committee press release.\n\nArch crypto-skeptic Maxine Waters \u2013 who recently led a committee visit to meet regulators in Switzerland, where the Libra Association will be based \u2013 heads the committee and has previously called on Zuckerberg to halt work on Libra.\n\nThe committee says that the hearing, before the full committee, will be named \u201cAn Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors.\u201d\n\nThe press release also made mention of the so-called Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, a piece of draft legislation that would \u201cprohibit large platform utilities, like Facebook, from becoming chartered, licensed or registered as a United States financial institution.\u201d\n\nThe committee added,\n\n\u201cThe bill [would] also prohibit large platform utilities from establishing, maintaining, or operating a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value.\u201d\n\nAnd American lawmakers will not only target Facebook, but also its Libra partners. Two members of the Senate\u2019s own finance committee have written open letters to Stripe, Mastercard and Visa \u2013 all of whom are said to be wavering in their support for Libra.\n\nAuthored by Senators Sherrod Brown and Brian Schatz, the letters (which were shared online by Schatz) told Stripe, Mastercard and Visa, in what appeared to be a direct threat,\n\n\u201cIf you take [Libra] on, you can expect a high level of scrutiny not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities.\u201d\n\nThe senators even went as far as to allege that should the three companies continue supporting Facebook, they would be indirectly helping to fund \u201conline child sexual abuse\u201d and \u201cfuel the growth in global criminal activity.\u201d\n\nBrown is an outspoken Libra critic and during a Senate hearing in summer this year, the senator told Facebook\u2019s blockchain head David Marcus that the prospect of people \u201ctrusting Facebook with their hard-earned money\u201d was \u201cdelusional.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, London has taken a different approach. In a Bank of England (BoE) release, authorities stated that even though \u201cthe terms of engagement for innovations such as Libra must be adopted in advance\u201d of the token launch, they were prepared to work with Facebook.\n\nThe BoE stated,\n\n\u201cLibra has the potential to become a systemically important payment system.\u201d\n\nThe central bank did add provisos, however, stating that \u201cactivities conducted by other firms in the Libra ecosystem such as validators, exchanges or wallet providers\u201d would need to prove their \u201cstability\u201d before Britain green-lights Libra.\n\nThe BoE advised UK regulatory authorities to \u201cuse their powers accordingly.\u201d\n\nIn August, Bank of England governor Mark Carney made a radical proposal for an overhaul of the global financial system that would eventually replace the dollar as a reserve currency with a Libra-like virtual one.", "description": "Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are taking very different approaches to Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency \u2013 with American politicians hoping to strong-arm the social network and Libra partners, while British central bank officials have laid out a roadmap for the forthcoming token.", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/eaea86a346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
