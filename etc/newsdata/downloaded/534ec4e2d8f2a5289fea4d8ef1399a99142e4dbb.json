( EXAS ) : \"There are a lot of high multiple stocks selling off. I say buy it,\" said Jim Cramer.\n\nLet's check the charts and indicators to see if this a good time and location to go long EXAS.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of EXAS, below, we can see that the price chart and the indicators have weakened the past two months. In early August prices tested the rising 50-day moving average line and the daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) turned lower just before that in late July.\n\nEarly this month EXAS closed below the declining 50-day moving average line and Tuesday it is very close to a test of the rising 200-day line. The OBV line is making a new low for the move down and signaling that sellers of EXAS are more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a sell mode below the zero line.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of EXAS, below, we can see that the chart has weakened. Prices are poised to test the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has rolled over the past four months and the MACD oscillator crossed to a take profits sell signal in August.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of EXAS, below, we can see a top pattern playing out from June (look for the \"6\" on the chart). A possible downside price target of $86 is being projected.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The charts and indicators of EXAS look weak and with a Point and Figure target of $86 being projected I want to take my time buying.", "description": "Exact Sciences: Finding the Exact Price to Buy This Stock...EXAS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Exact Sciences", "Finding The Exact Price To Buy The Stock", "Let'S Check The Charts", "Indicators To See If This A Good Time", "Location To Go Long Exas.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/504bc0b0-b1fb-11e9-ad16-b778c7a3a925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
