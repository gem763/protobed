I\u2019m not sure how many other players could say that.\n\n\u201cBut it didn\u2019t go my way. Eddie\u2019s the boss, so who are we to argue with his selection. But I\u2019ve got no regrets.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get selected for England all season, so the platform I had to show how much I wanted to play for England and how much I was improving was for Quins. And I think I did that pretty well.\n\n\u201cI think that shows my character, wanting to bounce back. Plenty of players would have folded and just cruised through.\n\n\u201cBut I think that shows my ambition and character, what I did for Quins.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s all I could do, and selection\u2019s down to him (Jones).\u201d\n\nAsked if he had any regrets about the particular incident with Te\u2019o, Brown added: \u201cNo, because when the details come out people will know how everyone in that situation handled themselves. And I\u2019ve got no regrets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the right time to go into full details of what happened.\n\n\u201cI always try to stick to the team ethos and it wouldn\u2019t be right for me with the guys preparing for a World Cup, Eddie and the players, to start talking about things that went on during the pre-season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more important for them to focus on what they are doing.\n\n\u201cBut obviously the World Cup won\u2019t last forever, so there will be a time and a point where I feel comfortable and the time is right to speak about what my experiences were.\u201d\n\nInsisting the full truth will come out after the World Cup, Brown admitted he has not spoken to Te\u2019o since the incident.\n\nTe\u2019o was also omitted from England\u2019s final World Cup squad, and has since signed a short-term deal with Toulon \u2013 before heading to Japan\u2019s Sunwolves for next season.\n\nAsked if he has been in touch with Te\u2019o since the incident, Brown said: \u201cNo. He\u2019s in France isn\u2019t he?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously heartbreaking to miss out, you want to put things right from 2015.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard my whole career to be involved in these big tournaments.\n\n\u201cI still feel I\u2019m the best full-back for England. If I didn\u2019t feel that I would have stopped playing for England.\n\n\u201cBut like I said selection is one man\u2019s choice, and he\u2019s the main man with that job, and unfortunately it didn\u2019t go my way this time.\n\n\u201cI still feel I\u2019m the best English full-back, that\u2019s not being arrogant that\u2019s just what I believe.\n\n\u201cI think everyone who was in the 45 who isn\u2019t in Japan is on standby, that\u2019s my understanding.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Mike Brown insists he has \u201cno regrets\u201d over the incident with Ben Te\u2019o that could have cost him his\u00a0World Cup place with England.
