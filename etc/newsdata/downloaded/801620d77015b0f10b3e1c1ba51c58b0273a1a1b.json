Two players on each side received yellow cards, the KFA said.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino was at the match and said in a statement that he was \u201cdisappointed to see there were no fans in the stands\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by this and by several issues related to its live broadcast and problems with visas and access for foreign journalists,\u201d he said, adding that, for FIFA, freedom of the press and freedom of speech were paramount.\n\nLast year saw a flurry of sports diplomacy between the two Koreas, which fielded a joint ice hockey team and marched together at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nThat set the stage for a series of summits between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the South\u2019s Moon Jae-in. The two Koreas even talked about a joint bid to host the 2032 Summer Olympics.\n\nBut relations have since cooled over stalled negotiations over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\n\nIn addition to the television blackout and empty stands, South Korean media were also blocked, with only some 30 KFA staff with limited communications allowed to relay information about the game, Seoul officials said.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s squad, including Tottenham Hotspur striker Son Heung-min, arrived in Pyongyang on Monday via Beijing instead of a shorter route across the DMZ between the two Koreas, after months of no response from Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cThere have always been at least some South Korean fans, so it will be our first time to play without any,\u201d defender Kim Min-jae said before leaving for Beijing on Monday.\n\n\u201cBut we can overcome and play well.\u201d\n\nOne South Korean user of the South\u2019s Naver web portal said: \u201cHow do we co-host the Olympics when we can\u2019t even watch one single qualifier?\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cBest if we win, but it\u2019s also fine to lose. I just hope our players return safely.\u201d\n\n(This story corrects to fix grable in paragraph one)", "description": "Long-time foes North and South Korea played a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday, their first football match in the North in 30 years, but no fans were allowed in the stands and Pyongyang refused to broadcast the game live.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
