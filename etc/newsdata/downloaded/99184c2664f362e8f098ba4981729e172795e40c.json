The caterpillar's bristles, which contain a toxin, break off and embed into skin. Shane Brooks, Detroit Free Press\n\nDon't be fooled by caterpillars with colorful and fuzzy exteriors: They might be poisonous.\n\nStinging, venomous caterpillars have plagued the South and parts of the Midwest.\n\nIn Michigan, the Clare County Chamber of Commerce issued a warning Oct. 10 for residents to avoid the American dagger moth caterpillar, which was spotted on a college campus.\n\nThe puss caterpillar \u2013 one of the most venomous of its kind in the USA \u2013 has appeared in Florida, Texas and South Carolina. A Florida woman posted on Facebook that she was hospitalized after receiving a painful sting from one of these critters.\n\nGenerally, stinging caterpillars \u2013 mainly the puss caterpillar, also known as the Southern flannel moth or the asp \u2013 are rare north of the Mason-Dixon line, says David Wagner, an entomologist at the University of Connecticut. Even in the South, where they'remost frequently spotted, they're uncommon, he says.\n\nWhen these caterpillars sting, the symptoms can range from mild discomfort to severe pain that can last for hours.\n\nPuss caterpillars may look innocuous, but they have venom injectors that pack \"quite a wallop,\" says University of Connecticut entomologist David Wagner.

Puss caterpillars' spines can cause a \"nasty\" reaction, Wagner says, causing severe pain and leaving behind a hematoma, a swelling of blood on the skin.\n\n\"It's not an instantaneous shock of a hornet or wasp, but it builds for a long time in a frightening way,\" Wagner tells USA TODAY. \"No one expects stings to gain in impact or discomfort, and these will, even up to an hour later. It packs quite a wallop.\"\n\nHe says a puss caterpillar sting can cause joint pain akin to \"serious arthritis\" long after the pain from the initial contact has subsided.\n\nHow to spot a venomous caterpillar\n\nCaterpillars that are brightly colored, have spines or hairs are probably venomous and should not be touched.\n\n\"If it is in a place where it can cause problems, clip off the leaf or use a stick to relocate it,\" Ric Bessin, an entomologist at the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, tells USA TODAY.\n\nDon't touch this caterpillar. The American dagger caterpillar can cause severe irritation and hives. (Photo: Dave Wolf, For The Daily News)\n\nBessin says some caterpillars' venomous spines and hairs came about as a defense mechanism against predators. So did their brightly colored exteriors, a phenomenon known as aposematic coloration, Wagner says.\n\nPuss caterpillars have a hairy light-brown coat that Wagner describes as \"super soft and cuddly.\" American dagger moth caterpillars are bright yellow-green with black bristles that resemble eyebrows.\n\nIt's a warning sign for predators, Wagner cautions.\n\nCaterpillars with these exteriors can brazenly linger on leaves and other foliage without being attacked. Underneath the exterior of the puss caterpillar are small spines that break off; the rear ends of the American dagger moth caterpillars have bristles that embed in skin.\n\nWhat to do if you come into contact with a venomous caterpillar\n\nThe most crucial advice Wagner and Bessin offer is not to brush the caterpillar from your skin. Swatting off the caterpillar makes it more likely that the venomous hairs or spines will be left on your clothing.\n\nInstead, very carefully remove the caterpillar with a stick or another object, Bessin advises.\n\nOnce the caterpillar has been removed, take a shower, Wagner suggests. \"Wash away the hairs and cool down. That might help the allergenic reaction,\" he said.\n\nWash your contaminated clothes as well, as a few hairs or spines might remain.\n\nWagner says don't panic over toxic caterpillars.\n\n\"I've been in the business for 30 years, and it will be one of the most miserable days of your life, for sure.\" he says. \"But it's so infrequent as to not be worth worrying about.\"\n\nContributing: Maryann Struman, Detroit Free Press.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/16/puss-american-dagger-moth-what-know-poisonous-caterpillars/3974965002/", "description": "Poisonous stings from the puss caterpillar and other types have plagued the South and parts of the Midwest.
