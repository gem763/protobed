Rosebud can detect an epileptic episode about 15 minutes before it occurs.\n\nSarah Vible almost didn\u2019t finish college because of her epilepsy.\n\nDuring her sophomore year, the frequency of her seizures increased until she was losing consciousness several times a week.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go to class because I was nervous about something happening,\u201d she says. She decided to drop out of school midway through her second year and moved back home to Delaware.\n\nBut Ms. Vible, now 25, returned to college and graduated. She is working today in a crisis-management center for adolescents in Delaware. And she owes it all, she says, to a 57-pound yellow Labrador named Rosebud.\n\nRosebud is a service dog trained at a nonprofit called Canine Partners for Life in Cochraneville, Pa. The dog can detect when Ms. Vible will have a seizure about 15 minutes before it happens. She lets Ms. Vible know with a whine or a bark and then lies down with her owner until the seizure is over.\n\nSeizure-alert dogs are part of a growing class of service animals that can detect warning signs of epileptic seizures and diabetic emergencies and identify other medical conditions. Demand has surged, according to trainers and training centers\u2014some of which now have long wait lists\u2014as recent scientific studies have started to confirm the dogs\u2019 efficacy in helping their owners.\n\nSarah Vible left college because of her seizures, but after getting Rosebud she returned to school and graduated.

Some service-dog trainers, lawmakers and health practitioners see a need for more oversight and standards. While the raising and training of dogs in general has long had some irresponsible parties, the stakes are higher when people pay up to $50,000 in return for a dog with a purported ability to help people with medical, and at times life-threatening, conditions.\n\nTheir acute sense of smell helps the dogs detect low and high blood-sugar levels and epileptic seizures before they happen. Researchers haven't yet identified the specific compounds that the dogs are smelling. But once the dogs recognize the smell, they are trained to respond with a specific action such as barking or pawing at their owners. Depending on the owner\u2019s state and the animal\u2019s training, some dogs also might alert another adult, bring a juice box or press a button that sends a phone text to a caregiver.\n\nThe University of Bristol in England this year produced a study of dogs\u2019 ability to detect hypoglycemia, which occurs when a diabetic\u2019s blood sugar drops dangerously. If left untreated, this can lead to unconsciousness or death. In assessing the effectiveness of 27 glycemia-alert dogs, the Bristol study found that the dogs alerted their owners to 83% of hypoglycemic episodes in more than 4,000 hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes.\n\nThe findings of another study released this year showed promise for people suffering from epilepsy. Researchers from the University of Rennes in Normandy, France, presented dogs with samples of breath and sweat odors obtained from epileptic patients having seizures, not having seizures and exercising (to determine whether the dogs were just detecting sweat). All of the dogs succeeded in identifying the epileptic-seizure-odor sample, and the dogs spent about 23 seconds investigating the seizure smell, compared with about five seconds spent on the other samples.\n\nThe lead researcher of the study, Amelie Catala, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rennes, says the research could help in the development of electronic noses, devices that can detect and analyze odors and flavors.\n\n\u201cIf there is an organic compound related to these diseases that we can detect and identify, it could help develop electronic noses,\u201d she says.\n\nMedical-alert dogs are being trained by for-profit and nonprofit centers, by individual trainers and at times by individual pet owners themselves. In addition to those skills already mentioned, some have been trained to warn patients about abnormal heart rhythms, and to detect allergens. Dogs also have been trained to help identify certain cancers in laboratory settings.\n\nSarah Vible now works at a crisis-management center for adolescents, with Rosebud, a 6-year-old yellow Labrador, nearby.

But such training isn\u2019t regulated at the state or federal level.\n\nSome consumer complaints have arisen. In May 2018, the Virginia Attorney General\u2019s Office filed a lawsuit against Service Dogs by Warren Retrievers, a nonprofit based in Madison, Va., alleging that it violated consumer-protection and solicitation-of-contributions laws.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office in a statement accompanying the suit alleges that the nonprofit sold \u201cso-called \u2018diabetic-alert dogs\u2019 for tens of thousands of dollars, when they were often delivering poorly trained puppies with significant behavioral issues and inadequate skills or training to notify a customer of a potentially life-threatening high or low blood sugar situation.\u201d The attorney general\u2019s office says it has received more than 80 complaints about the trainer from dissatisfied customers. The suit also alleges that the nonprofit \u201cmisled customers and charitable donors about aspects of its payment structure.\u201d\n\nGlenn Franklin Koontz, an attorney for Service Dogs by Warren Retrievers, says the nonprofit declines to comment. But Mr. Koontz adds, \u201cI believe the complaint to be completely unfounded.\u201d According to Mr. Koontz, the lawsuit \u201cis the result of a few agitated customers, who are a small minority of the customer base.\u201d\n\nComplaints about alleged inadequate training are growing in part because federal laws pertaining to service dogs are \u201cvague,\u201d says David Favre, a law professor at Michigan State University and creator of the Animal Legal and Historical Center, an online public library of animal legislation.\n\nTrained service animals are mentioned in the American Disabilities Act, which specifically allows their use in public places. Service dogs are specifically trained to be well mannered in public spaces and show no aggression.\n\nSince she got Rosebud, Sarah Vible says, her seizures have become less frequent. Photo: Michelle Gustafson for the Wall Street Journal\n\nIn recent years, however, more owners of dogs with no formal training to behave in public spaces have passed off their pets as service dogs. These untrained dogs have attacked legitimate service dogs on various occasions, according to trainers and owners.\n\nSeveral states have introduced legislation to impose fines of several hundred dollars and up to one year in prison for people attempting to pass off pet dogs as service dogs. California also recently introduced a bill with similar fines and prison time for people selling dogs that haven\u2019t been properly trained. These new laws aren\u2019t enforced much, however.\n\nA handful of national organizations are introducing standards to help people find reputable service dogs. Assistance Dogs International certifies nonprofit dog-training programs around the country. Dogs4Diabetics is also launching a project to develop and publish national standards for medical dog training and performance.\n\nUsually, when puppies are around six months old, centers or solo trainers identify those with potential to be service dogs and then spend six months to a few years training them. Trainers and centers also try to match dogs with the right patients or owners, and provide additional training at that stage.\n\nWhile the animals can dramatically improve the day-to-day life of their owners, they don\u2019t provide foolproof protection. Dogs can make mistakes if they are tired or ill. They also can miss alerts if they sleep deeply, experts say.\n\nMs. Vible, the crisis-center worker in Delaware, says Rosebud gets distracted sometimes in crowds, where people try to pet her. It can be stressful, but Ms. Vible says she enjoys sports events and concerts nevertheless.\n\n\u201cI got her special earmuffs for large crowds,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. McConnon is a writer in New York.
