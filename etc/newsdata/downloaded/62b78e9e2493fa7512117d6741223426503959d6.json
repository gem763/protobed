According to prosecutor it does not identify the physician in charge or even the hospital.\n\nFormer Justice Minister Cho Kuk's wife submitted dubious medical records to prosecutors on Tuesday to evade a possible arrest warrant after claiming she has a brain tumor.\n\nA prosecution source said Chung has been told to submit additional documents such as CT and MRI records, but her lawyer claimed that could \"harm the hospital and other patients, and we informed prosecutors in advance that we intend to conceal this sensitive information.\"\n\nThe lawyer added that the issuer of the document was an orthopedic doctor because Chung suffers from several ailments and he was one of several physicians who checked her up.\n\nBut a neurosurgeon at a large hospital said, \"It's impossible to consider the document she submitted legally valid since it lacks even basic information like a doctor's name or medical license number and there is no seal on it.\"\n\nOne lawyer said, \"Prosecutors are not going to disclose the name of the hospital anyway, so there's no point trying to hide the information.\"\n\nCho's younger brother, who is also implicated in the widening corruption scandal, now also claims he needs emergency back surgery but has yet to undergo the procedure, according to prosecutors. The brother is suspected of taking hundreds of millions of won in bribes from applicants for teaching jobs at a private educational foundation run by Cho's family.\n\nProsecutors have applied for an arrest warrant for Cho's brother, but a court rejected the request citing his mysterious back problem.\n\nCho resigned earlier this week amid massive protests after just 35 days in the job, where he was ironically tasked with reforming the prosecution that was even then coming after him.", "description": "Cho Kuk's Wife Submits Dodgy Medical Records to Duck Questioning", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/17/2019101701506_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
