It was in a cardboard sleeve dated 1950. My dad made the record for my mom when he was in the Korean War\u2014the first year they were married.\n\nHe talked about how much he loved her, couldn\u2019t wait to be with her again, and how he missed her. There was so much emotion in his voice, I could hear it crack.\n\nI listened to the scratchy recording slack jawed. How in the world did this happen? I wondered. How did this couple who obviously loved each other in the beginning, end up having such a terrible relationship filled with physical abuse, violent arguing and months of silent passive aggression?\n\nWEDDING GUEST FLEES RECEPTION AFTER GIRLFRIEND CATCHES BRIDE'S BOUQUET\n\nFrom my earliest remembrance, I didn\u2019t think my parents liked each other, much less loved each other. I spent many nights hiding in a closet with my hands over my ears to shut out the yelling. But apparently, they didn\u2019t start out that way.\n\nHow did that happen? How does that happen?\n\nIn the Song of Solomon, Solomon prayed that he and his Shulammite would watch out for the \u201clittle foxes\u201d that could sneak in and sabotage the blooming vineyard of their love. (Song 2:15). But just as those foxes can sneak in and ruin a blooming relationship, they can also sneak in and wreck a mature marriage.\n\nLittle foxes are anything or anyone that can creep in and weaken a marriage. If they aren\u2019t dealt with, little foxes become big foxes with fangs of disappointment and claws of resentment. After a few years of marriage, we can forget why we married that incredible person in the first place. What was I thinking? This isn\u2019t what I signed up for. This is not who I thought my spouse was.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nYou can blot out the sun with your thumb if you bring it close enough to your eye. And we can blot out our spouse\u2019s admirable qualities if we hold up the thumb of disapproval close enough to our heart.\n\nIt\u2019s not only what we say to our spouses, but also what we say to ourselves about our spouses that affect the atmosphere of our homes and relationships. The term confirmation bias refers to the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one\u2019s existing beliefs or theories. It\u2019s when people want something to be true, or believe that something is true, and then gravitate toward information that supports their beliefs and reject information that casts doubt on them.\n\nSay encouraging words about your spouse to yourself, and you\u2019ll begin to think and act more positively.\n\nIf you tell yourself that your spouse is selfish or lazy, you will begin looking for actions and attitudes to back that up. If you tell yourself your spouse is a wonderful parent and hard worker, you\u2019ll look for confirmation to prove it correct.\n\nSay encouraging words about your spouse to yourself, and you\u2019ll begin to think and act more positively. When you are feeling irritated, ask yourself, \u201cWhat have I been telling myself about my husband or wife? Am I telling myself that he or she is irresponsible, clueless, lazy, or prideful? Or am I telling myself that he or she is a gift from God, compassionate companion, and caring friend?\" Whatever you tell yourself, you\u2019ll believe it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe need to avoid focusing on the 5 percent negative and concentrate on the 95 percent positive. Cheer your spouse on the good stuff and give the rest to God. I suggest making a list of all your spouse\u2019s admirable qualities. Not just the outward appearance, but also the inner strengths. Keep the list handy and add to it as qualities come to mind. Then, if you\u2019re smart, one day you will give him or her the list.\n\nThe Bible tells us that \u201cdeath and life are in the power of the tongue\u201d (Proverbs 18:21). Oftentimes, the death or life of a marriage is in the power of the tongue as well. You likely don\u2019t have a scratchy old record of your spouse declaring his or her undying love, but we can all make sure that our spouse has a mental record that plays and replays words of love that last a lifetime.", "description": "We can all make sure that our spouse has a mental record that plays and replays words of love that last a lifetime.", "authors": ["Sharon Jaynes"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/iStock-914254158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
