It also obliges the central bank and private banks to contribute $3.3 billion to achieve a \u201cnear zero deficit\u201d for the 2020 budget.\n\nIt also includes a plan to privatize the telecommunications sector and an overhaul of the costly and crumbling electricity sector, which poses one of the biggest strains on the country\u2019s depleted finances.\n\nGovernment sources said Hariri\u2019s cabinet would meet at midday on Monday at the presidential palace to approve the reform package.\n\nHOPEFUL\n\nThe anti-government protests, fueled by crippling economic conditions and anger at perceived government corruption, have fanned out across the country since Thursday.\n\nCheerful, buoyant and hopeful their protests would bring change, people of all ages and religions played patriotic songs and danced in the streets, with some forming human chains and chanting for their leaders to be ousted.\n\nFestival-like scenes dominated the country from the capital Beirut to remote towns, with loudspeakers blaring music as crowds kept pouring into the streets.\n\n\u201cI am here because I am disgusted by our politicians. Nothing works. This is not a state. Salaries are very low, prices are very high. We don\u2019t even have work these days,\u201d said Cherine Shawa, 32, an interior architect, in Beirut.\n\nDemonstrators carry national flags during an anti-government protest in downtown Beirut, Lebanon October 20, 2019.

We have no hope in them but we\u2019re hopeful that these protests will bring change,\u201d Hanan Takkouche, in her 40s and among a group of women in the capital.\n\n\u201cThey came to fill their pockets. They\u2019re all crooks and thieves,\u201d she added.\n\nMany blamed the ruling elite for driving their children out of Lebanon because they failed to build a country that could provide jobs.\n\nArmy troops and security forces deployed across the country and blocked roads leading to the presidential palace. Banks said they would remain closed on Monday and the main labor union announced a general strike, threatening further paralysis.\n\nCONDITIONS MET\n\nA chorus of voices, from union leaders to politicians, have joined popular calls for Hariri\u2019s government to resign. The Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces party has said its four ministers would withdraw from the government.\n\nBut the approval of the reforms by Hariri\u2019s partners seem to have met his conditions and would most likely push him to stay the course, government sources said.\n\nIf Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who is traditionally backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigns it would be harder for the various parties that make up the ruling coalition to form a new cabinet.\n\nA new cabinet would also likely see Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies more in control, a shift that would make it nearly impossible for international donors or Gulf Arab countries at odds with Iran to offer aid or investments.\n\nWithout a foreign funding boost, officials and economists predict a currency devaluation or a debt default within months.\n\nThe IMF said last week that Lebanon\u2019s crisis requires tough austerity measures such as tax hikes and levies on fuel, steps the country\u2019s politicians have publicly vowed not to take.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy registered just 0.3 percent growth last year. The IMF said the reforms were needed to stem a ballooning deficit and public debt it forecasts to reach 155 percent of GDP by year-end.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nThe officials said the budget would not include additional taxes or fees after a decision last week to put a levy on WhatsApp calls triggered the unrest.\n\nThe reforms also called for establishing new regulatory and transparency bodies within a \u201cshort period\u201d of time to oversee reform plans.", "description": "Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri agreed on Sunday a package of reforms with government partners to ease an economic crisis that has sparked protests aimed at ousting a ruling elite seen as riddled with corruption and cronyism.", "authors": ["Samia Nakhoul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442991891&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0D7", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
