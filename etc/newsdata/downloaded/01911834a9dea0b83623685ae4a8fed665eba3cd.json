Astounded, she says: 'Brandy what have you done?' and the pup bounds back inside\n\nBrandy bounds back into the room and looks up at Ms Irving as she again asks: 'What have you done?'\n\nShe adds: 'Oh, I can see that you're proud of yourself. What is this?'\n\nAn innocent-looking Brandy then rests his head on the floor, perfectly in line with the mess he created.\n\nThe HR worker said: 'Brandy is very needy, so I'm trying to give him some space at the moment.\n\n'I went for a wee, and straight away he ran into the kitchen, got on the table, put his head in my handbag and took out a biro.\n\nMs Irving says: 'What have you done? Oh, I can see that you're proud of yourself. What is this?' An innocent-looking Brandy then rests his head on the floor, perfectly in line with the mess he created\n\n'He chewed it and the ink went everywhere. It was in the bedroom, in the kitchen - it was everywhere. I had no idea that ink go that far!'\n\nNot only did the dog's inky paw-prints cover Ms Irving's kitchen floor, they also stained her sofa - and are proving incredibly hard to clean.\n\n'The kitchen was easy, but the sofa looks like it has been attacked,' she said.\n\nMs Irving has only had him for six months, but Brandy is already gaining a reputation for mischief\n\n'I didn't know whether to laugh or get him re-homed! At first I thought it was soil - then it clicked and I thought \"right, get the bleach\".'\n\nThe hardest thing to clean, however, has been Brandy himself.\n\nMs Irving said: 'His paws were dyed blue! We are three or four baths in now, and his fur is still stained. He has to go to the dog groomer to have his hair cut and cleaned.'\n\nShe has only had him for six months, but Brandy is already gaining a reputation for mischief.\n\n'My 19-year-old daughter who lives down south calls him Ginger Nut, because he's so mad. She always rings up and asks what he's done now,' Ms Irving said.\n\nDespite the destruction, she is anything but angry with her devilish dog.\n\nMs Irving added: 'It is what it is. It's part and parcel of owning a dog. He's like a toddler, he's just learning. For him, it was fantastic fun.\n\n'He can be naughty, but no of course we can't stay angry at him. He's only a puppy - he's only a baby!'", "description": "Blue ink from a biro pen dyed mischievous\u00a0six-month-old Brandy's paws.
