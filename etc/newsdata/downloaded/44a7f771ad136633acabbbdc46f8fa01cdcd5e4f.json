The Leicester winger marked his 50th appearance by going in at the corner from a Tom Curry pass in the 18th minute and then sealed a magnificent counter-attacking move orchestrated Henry Slade, who kept his head after claiming an interception to chip through to the corner for his team-mate to finished.\n\nAnthony Watson is embraced by his teammates after his try added gloss to the scoreline\n\nHead coach Jones had been under pressure to deliver for England at the Rugby World Cup\n\nKurtley Beale's penalty-kicking kept Australia in touch and had reduced their arrears to 17-9 by half-time before they scored their only try of the game just after the interval to give England a major test of nerve.\n\nWinger Marika Koroibete scored with a wonderful individual effort from teenager Jordan Petaia's clever inside-pass to bring Australia back to within a point at 17-16 following Beale's successful conversion.\n\nSinckler's try always looked like being the game-breaker and so it proved, with Farrell's kicking further extending England's lead as the clocked ticked down. An interception try from Anthony Watson confirmed England's victory with four minutes remaining.", "description": "MATT HUGHES: The scintillating prospect of a last-four meeting with New Zealand or Ireland in Yokohama next weekend now awaits Eddie Jones' side after this mature performance.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/10/19916672-0-image-a-40_1571476897692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
