But a combination of both on a par four is virtually unheard of.\n\nThe only one in the history of the US PGA Tour was made by Andrew Magee on the 17th hole at Scottsdale in Phoenix, Arizona, in January 2001.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually had one hole-in-one on a par four, but never in competition. This would have been spectacular,\u201d revealed Mickelson.\n\n\u201cI mean it was right at it, but you never think it\u2019s going to hit the pin or go in,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell where the distance is or where it\u2019s going to fly. And I couldn\u2019t really see it. I just saw the reaction of the guys up on the green and knew that it almost went in.\n\n\u201cIt would have changed my whole attitude because the day was pretty frustrating otherwise,\u201d he said after a level-par round containing four bogeys, two birdies and that eagle left him two-under going into the weekend.\n\nThomas leads in Jeju, South Korea, after setting the event\u2019s 36-hole tournament scoring record with a 13-under 131 total after a 63 on Friday.", "description": "Jeju (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Phil Mickelson came within a whisker Friday of an amazing new chapter in his storied career when he was a fraction from a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/0aae84_phil-mickelson-was-whisker-friday-player-in-us-pga-tour-history-register-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
