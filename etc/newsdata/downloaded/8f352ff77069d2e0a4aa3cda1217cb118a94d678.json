Teenagers in foster care face a particularly challenging time getting adopted, with 15- to 17-year-olds waiting on average twice as long for an adoptive home as children 14 years old and younger. No matter their age, all kids need a supportive, loving home, and the teenage years are an especially critical period for parental help and guidance.\n\n\"Meeting with young people regularly who have left the foster care system, some with permanent families and some without, we are reminded routinely and emphatically how important a sense of belonging and connection through being a part of a family is to these young people and others like them,\" stated Jerry Milner, the Associate Commissioner of the Children's Bureau. \"When we allow children and youth for whom we have responsibility to leave our foster care system without one of the most important ingredients for their long-term success and well-being \u2013 a permanent family \u2013 we are doing them an injustice and perpetuating trauma in their lives. Ensuring that they have permanency and stability in their lives must be a primal responsibility for all of us in child welfare.\"\n\nOftentimes, prospective parents look forward to the milestones associated with raising a child from birth\u2014such as teaching a child how to walk or speak, but don't think about the rewards that come with raising a teen. This new creative serves as an extension of the campaign's previous rounds of work and reminds viewers that adopting a teen from foster care also comes with its own benefits and life-changing moments. Ultimately, the work illustrates that teens can have as much of an impact on their family's life as parents have in theirs.\n\nInspired by true stories and anecdotes from real families, the PSAs are filled with heartfelt memories that actual adoptive families have experienced after adopting a teen. Each PSA ends with \"Learn about adopting a teen from foster care. You can't imagine the reward,\" reminding prospective parents that teens in foster care can also help them grow in new ways. In a new approach for the campaign this year, there will also be poignant docu-style videos featuring three real families talking about the rewards and experiences of adopting their teen.\n\n\"We spent hours talking with adoptive families during the creative process,\" said Leo Leone, Executive Creative Director at Barbarian. \"In those conversations, we found their stories to be genuinely compelling\u2014often ending conversations with both smiles on our faces and tears in our eyes. That was the center of our creative idea\u2014real, emotional, life-changing moments built on these special family relationships.\"\n\nThe Ad Council will distribute the new TV, radio, print, out-of-home and digital PSA materials to media outlets nationwide this week. Per the Ad Council's model, the PSAs will run in time and space donated by the media. Since the initial launch of the campaign in 2004, the campaign has received more than $608 million in donated media support across television, radio, print, out-of-home and digital media. At launch, AdoptUSKids will be supporting the campaign by hosting a Facebook Live event, featuring engaging discussions with adopted youth and premiering the new PSAs.\n\nThe work directs audiences to visit AdoptUSKids.org or to call 1-888-200-4005 to receive information about the foster care system and the adoption process. Potential foster and adoptive families can also call 1-877-236-7831 for information in Spanish.\n\nFor more information about adoption, or about becoming an adoptive parent to a child or teen from foster care, please visit AdoptUSKids.org or visit the AdoptUSKids social communities on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families\n\nWithin the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is responsible for federal programs that promote the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals, and communities.
