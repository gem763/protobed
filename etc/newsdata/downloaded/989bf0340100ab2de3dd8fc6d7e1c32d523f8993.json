REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - A slide in banking stocks dragged Indian shares lower on Thursday following a sharp rise in the previous session, as markets awaited earnings reports from major IT services companies.\n\nShares in Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd fell 9% after the central bank blocked its proposed merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd.\n\nIt was the latest in a series of negative headlines surrounding the banking industry, which is saddled with a mountain of soured debt.\n\nThe broader NSE Nifty was down 0.35% at 11,273.60 by 0437 GMT, while the benchmark BSE Sensex was weaker by 0.31% at 38,060.12.\n\nAll 12 stocks on the Nifty bank index were in the red, and RBL Bank Ltd was the biggest decliner with a drop of 4.1%.\n\nIT services firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will report its financial results later in the day, marking the start of the September-quarter earnings season. Industry peer Infosys Ltd is scheduled to report its results on Friday. Shares in both TCS and Infosys were each up roughly 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, telecom stocks rose after Reliance Jio said it would start charging customers for calls made through its network to other operators.\n\nThe move could signal a rise in industry prices and revenues if more operators follow Jio\u2019s lead, analysts say.\n\nJio\u2019s rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd gained 3.8% and 4.3%, respectively. Shares in Grasim Industries Ltd, the top shareholder in Vodafone Idea, rose 4.5%.", "description": "A slide in banking stocks dragged Indian shares lower on Thursday following a sharp rise in the previous session, as markets awaited earnings reports from major IT services companies.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439128984&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9909Z", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
