Photo: GraphicaArtis/Getty Images\n\nSo often, when you\u2019re a renter, a dream apartment is less about perfection than learning to make the right concessions. My new apartment is a block from the train, but comes with the caveat of linoleum floors. My bedroom is flooded with natural light, but my kitchen has exactly six inches of counter. Some imperfections just aren\u2019t worth the trouble, while others, I\u2019ve found, can be solved with a good widget. Below, the seven things I\u2019ve used to turn a so-so apartment into my own little slice of heaven \u2014 none of which requires overhauling design or even leaving a mark. (We talked to interior designer Fiona Byrne about the six best ways to zhuzh up your rental with d\u00e9cor, too.)\n\nHyde Tools 13050 Delta Heavy Duty Glass Scraper With 5 Blades The most charming places are often to be found under five generations of sloppily applied paint. When I moved into my place, the windows, sink, and light switch covers were covered in specks of errant paint that were not deal-breakers, but were definitely eyesores. This razor-blade contraption has them looking like new. Think of it like a chemical peel, but for your house. $3 at Amazon Buy $3 at Amazon Buy\n\nFeed-N-Wax Wood Polish and Conditioner $8 (was $15, now 47% off) I originally bought this product for a thrifted teak wall unit, but I\u2019ve found myself using it everywhere (read those Amazon reviews) \u2014 on coffee tables, side tables, even dressers. Most things clean the surface of objects, but Feed-N-Wax actually nourishes them. It has a grandmotherly rich-person smell, like oranges, that\u2019s just \u201cclean.\u201d At the very least, it makes old kitchen cabinets look a lot less tired. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nCoavas Non-Adhesive Frosted Window Film If a room is short on natural light, the worst thing you can do is put curtains on your windows. I\u2019m lucky enough to have a window in my kitchen, but it overlooks an alley and the kitchen of my neighbor. I love the sunlight \u2014 I don\u2019t love the view. These removable window films preserve light without sacrificing privacy \u2014 cut it to the proper measurement (with, say, the razor-blade contraption), then apply it to a clean window that\u2019s been sprayed with water. Smooth it out (you can use a squeegee or even just binding of a thick magazine), and you\u2019re done. Lapsed Catholics and lovers of camp can opt for the less subtle stained-glass pattern from Artscape. $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nAiduy Kitchen Bathroom Paper Towel Holder One great frustration of a tiny kitchen is wandering through your apartment with wet hands, trying to remember where you put the paper towels. I don\u2019t plan on sacrificing my limited counter to something as pointless as a towel dispenser, so I have this one that clips to the underside of overhead cabinets. If you don\u2019t care as much about how it looks, there\u2019s also a version that clips only to the lower one (it hangs a bit too far when hung from an overhead cabinet) $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nNote: There are also a lengthwise version and over-the-door version.\n\nRichards Homewares Commercial Grade Closet Doubler Rod If your bedroom is the size of a closet, then you\u2019re going to need a closet that feels as large as a bedroom. This innovation doubles your storage by turning your one closet rod into two. Replace all your hangers with slim velvet ones and you can start telling your friends you have a walk-in. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nNarrow Brass Picture Rail Hooks If you\u2019re unlucky enough to have brittle plaster walls, then you might be lucky enough to have picture rails \u2014 that thin strip of molding about two-thirds up a wall, most commonly found in older apartments. I used these hooks to hang plants in my bedroom, but you can use them for your Goodfellas poster or Gloria Steinem print, or whatever. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
