But his story was fake, police say.", "language": "en", "text": "At a White House ceremony on Monday honoring \u201cheroes\u201d of recent mass shootings, President Trump vividly described the actions of one El Paso man. Chris Grant was \u201cpicking out snacks for his kids\u201d inside Walmart, Trump said, when he spotted the shooter and quickly took action.\n\n\u201cChris grabbed \u2014 listen to this \u2014 soda bottles and anything else in front of him,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand began hurling them at the gunman, distracting him from the other shoppers and causing the shooter to turn toward Chris and fire at Chris, whereby Chris suffered two very serious gunshot wounds.\u201d\n\nGrant, 50, was wounded in the August shooting, which killed 22 \u2014 but the rest of his story doesn\u2019t add up, El Paso police now say. Surveillance video of the massacre showed Grant in \u201can act of self-preservation, nothing more, nothing less,\u201d police said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that what he said is not truthful,\u201d El Paso Police Sgt. Enrique Carrillo told KVIA. \u201cWe saw his actions ... and it\u2019s not like he described.\u201d\n\nThe White House never checked out Grant\u2019s story with El Paso police, Carillo told the Washington Examiner.\n\n[\u2018You\u2019re a prop in the back\u2019: Advisers struggle to obey Trump\u2019s Kafkaesque rules]\n\nAlthough Grant traveled to D.C., he didn\u2019t get his commendation from Trump, who handed it to Grant\u2019s mother instead. That\u2019s because the Texas man was detained by the Secret Service before the ceremony, ABC News reported, over an open arrest warrant.\n\nIn a statement, the Secret Service confirmed that \u201ca White House visitor with an arrest warrant was temporarily detained\u201d on Monday, although they declined to name the person. El Paso police told ABC News that it was Grant, although it\u2019s unclear what charges he faces.\n\nGrant\u2019s family didn\u2019t immediately return a message from The Washington Post late on Wednesday. The White House also has not responded to the El Paso police department\u2019s allegations.\n\nGrant first described his bottle-throwing bravery in an interview with CNN host Chris Cuomo days after the Aug. 3 shooting. Lying in a hospital bed with tubes sprouting from his nose, Grant choked up describing the attack.\n\n\u201cI saw him popping people off,\u201d Grant said. \u201cTo deter him, I started just chucking bottles. I just started throwing random bottles at him. I\u2019m not a baseball player, so one went this way and one went that way.\u201d\n\nBut then, Grant said, one bottle got close enough to catch the attention of the alleged shooter, later identified by police as Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old allegedly inspired by anti-immigrant hatred.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when he saw me,\u201d Grant said. \u201cHe just \u2014 boom, boom, boom, boom, boom \u2014 just started firing off rounds at me.\u201d\n\nGrant was hit twice near the rib cage, the El Paso Times reported. His family told the Times that he spent two days in a coma before waking up at the hospital.\n\nGrant\u2019s story was widely shared after Cuomo\u2019s piece aired, and he later met Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R). On Monday, he was among five El Paso survivors invited to the White House for an event that also honored six police officers who responded to a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe welcome 11 extraordinary American heroes,\u201d Trump said to open the ceremony.\n\n[\u2018Here in El Paso, we\u2019re just a family\u2019: City turns out for widower of Walmart massacre victim]\n\nCarillo said that El Paso police would have shared their concerns about Grant\u2019s story, had they been consulted.\n\n\u201cNobody bothered to check with us,\u201d Carrillo told the Examiner. \u201cThey would have been informed, as I am telling you now, that our detectives reviewed hours of video and his actions did not match his account.\u201d\n\nThe police spokesman emphasized that Grant hadn\u2019t done anything wrong during the attack \u2014 he simply hadn\u2019t tried to distract the shooter as he claimed. \u201cWe are not demeaning his reaction which are of basic human instincts but they amount to an act of self-preservation and nothing above that,\u201d Carillo told the El Paso Times.\n\nPolice did say they were surprised at how widely the video evidence differed from Grant\u2019s telling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything like this happen, never had a victim\u2019s report so skewed from what actually happened,\u201d said El Paso Sgt.
