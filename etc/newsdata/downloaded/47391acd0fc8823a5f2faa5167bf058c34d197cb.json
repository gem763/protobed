Police say Santos is also homeless and he was taken into custody with the weapon in his hands as he was fleeing. He has been arrested at least six other times in the past two years.\n\nIt was unclear early Sunday afternoon if he had an attorney to represent him.\n\nManhattan detective Michael Baldassano had said at a Saturday news conference that the men were attacked at random and police responded to a 911 call just before 2am as one assault was in progress.\n\nTwo witnesses told responding officers that the suspect was wearing a black jacket and black pants, which helped police find him quickly just a few streets away.\n\nTwo of the men were killed on the Bowery, a long thoroughfare that cuts north-south in downtown Manhattan, including through the heart of Chinatown, and has for decades been known as New York\u2019s skid row, inhabited by homeless people.\n\nDuring the day, the increasingly gentrified neighborhood is bustling with small businesses and street vendors offering discount goods, its sidewalks packed with pedestrians. A contemporary art museum stands cheek by jowl with a large homelessness mission and shelter.\n\nLate at night, when the shops close, it turns into a quiet, desolate neighborhood that was the setting for Saturday\u2019s attacks.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s mother, Fioraliza Rodriguez, told the New York Daily News that she had kicked her son out of her house three years ago because of addiction, he had assaulted her and his grandfather and stole from the family.\n\n\u201cI never thought he would kill someone,\u201d Rodriguez told the newspaper. \u201cI was afraid of him, though, because he punched me. That\u2019s when I told him to get out of my house.\u201d", "description": "Randy Santos, 24, was arrested after the deaths of four homeless men who were bludgeoned with a metal pipe as they were sleeping", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8679f5aff1f10bdbb3eed44724c9c7c1927aee1b/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae0e7f55fc9574db479be9603821475d", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
