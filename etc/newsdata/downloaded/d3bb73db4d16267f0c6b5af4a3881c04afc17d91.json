Here\u2019s why.", "language": "en", "text": "caption Joe De Sena. source Courtesy of Joe De Sena\n\nJoe De Sena is the founder and CEO of Spartan, the world\u2019s largest obstacle race and endurance brand. He is also the New York Times best-selling author of \u201cSpartan Up\u201d and \u201cSpartan Fit,\u201d and recently released his third book, \u201cThe Spartan Way.\u201d\n\nAs someone with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), De Sena has found it to be his greatest strength as an entrepreneur.\n\nHe says that his ADHD helped him pursue his own dreams, and he can\u2019t imagine living any other way. For him, a challenge is a new opportunity for achieving success.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is, without a doubt, my greatest strength. It\u2019s a major reason why I bounce off the walls until I find something important to focus on.\n\nThe kid who \u201ccan\u2019t sit still,\u201d the guy who seems distant in conversation, the entrepreneur obsessed with one idea: I\u2019m all of these things, but I don\u2019t see them as negatives in the least.\n\nMy most obvious symptom: hyperfocus\n\nWhat is ADHD? It\u2019s more complex than just a kid who can\u2019t sit still. ADHD is a brain disorder marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development.\n\nSymptoms include overlooking or missing details, an inability to listen, organizational issues, forgetfulness, and being easily distracted. My most obvious symptom? Hyperfocus.\n\nHonestly, I view this \u201csymptom\u201d as a home-run trait. Sure, my mind has trouble sticking to one thing, but that means I don\u2019t ruminate on irrelevant ideas or spend more than a minute feeling negative. My hyperfocus allows me to actually keep my attention on the things that move the needle each day. ADHD \u2013 and my hyperfocus \u2013 helped me leave my job on Wall Street to pursue my dream of ripping 1 million people off the couch. As it turns out, evolution helped me do this.\n\nHow the hyperfocus trait evolved\n\nTake it from Thom Hartmann, author of \u201cThe Edison Gene: ADHD and the Gift of the Hunter Child.\u201d\n\nHartmann claims that, in hunter-gatherer cultures, hunters needed hyperfocus more than gatherers. He implies that the ADHD hyperfocus trait provided a selective advantage in the past.\n\nThis might not make sense to you, because ADHD and a \u201clack of focus\u201d are generally perceived as negatives. But think about it for a second. The hunter scanned the environment, looking and waiting for something to focus on. Are you a hunter or a gatherer? Which would you rather be?\n\nI know I\u2019m a hunter, and this gene intensifies my inclination to act on ideas that I\u2019m scanning. My supposed \u201cdisorder\u201d led me to create Spartan, the Spartan Up Podcast, and the SpartanX Leadership Forum.\n\nWhen I\u2019m hyperfocused on one idea, I make it great. I only ruminate on what truly matters, leaving all the irrelevant noise behind. So why would I see ADHD as a \u201cweakness?\u201d I can\u2019t imagine living any other way.\n\nWhy my ADHD is a blessing\n\nWithout the hyperfocus trait, I\u2019d lack creativity, spontaneity, and a fast-paced lifestyle essential for entrepreneurship. It\u2019s the reason I\u2019m successful, and it\u2019s why ADHD is my greatest strength.\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer that we should all admire the things about our challenges that make us who we are. No, I can\u2019t sit for too long, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m fit. No, I don\u2019t always think before I act, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m direct and honest with everyone I meet. No, I didn\u2019t learn as well as others in the traditional classroom setting, but that\u2019s why I have gritty determination to succeed.\n\nMy advice to you: Tell yourself that every challenge is an opportunity to achieve success. Turn your struggle into triumph. Transform your \u201cdisorder\u201d into an advantage.\n\nNow stop reading, log onto LinkedIn, and tell me which \u201cweakness\u201d you\u2019re grateful for.", "description": "Business Insider - Joe De Sena is the founder and CEO of Spartan, the world's largest obstacle race and endurance brand..
