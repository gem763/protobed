No sabe hablar\", which translates as \"he doesn't know how to speak\".\n\nBut the protests from the five-time Ballon d'Or winner fell on deaf ears.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe red card shown to Dembele was the first of his career and could result in the Frenchman facing a two-match ban.\n\nThis could see him miss Barcelona's crucial El Clasico clash with Real Madrid on October 26.", "description": "Footage from the win over Sevilla captured Lionel Messi attempting in vain to defend his Barcelona team-mate", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Twitter", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542394.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Lionel-Messi-spotted-telling-referee-that-Ousmane-Dembele-doesnt-know-how-to-speak.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
