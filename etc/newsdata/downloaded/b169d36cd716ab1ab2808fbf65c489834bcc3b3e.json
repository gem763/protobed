In 2014, two retired Chilean military officers were handed prison sentences for torturing him. Bachelet and her mother, \u00c1ngela Jeria, were also imprisoned.\n\nBrazil: tortured dissidents appalled by Bolsonaro's praise for dictatorship Read more\n\nBolsonaro has frequently praised Brazil\u2019s 21-year military dictatorship and expressed admiration for rulers such as Pinochet, whose regime killed more than 3,000 people from 1973 to 1990.\n\nHis comments came after Bachelet criticized the increase in police killings in Brazil\u2019s two biggest cities.\n\nIn the first half of this year, 426 people were killed by police in S\u00e3o Paulo state while in Rio de Janeiro state, 881 were killed by police in the same period. The figures mean that Rio\u2019s police killings increased by 15%, even as total homicides in the state dropped by 23%, the G1 website reported.\n\nLast month, Bolsonaro said he hoped proposed new laws making it easier for police to kill would mean criminals \u201cdie in the street like cockroaches\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have seen large increases in police violence in 2019 amidst a public discourse legitimising summary executions,\u201d Bachelet said. Denials of state crimes can \u201centrench impunity and reinforce the message that state agents are above the law\u201d, she said. Black people and favela residents were disproportionately affected, she added.\n\nBachelet also raised concerns over the \u201cshrinking of civil and democratic space\u201d in Brazil and said at least eight human rights defenders were killed from January to June \u201cmainly over land disputes\u201d. She said a third of Amazon fires were in protected indigenous or conservation areas.\n\nOn his Facebook, Bolsonaro said Bachelet was following France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, who he accused of \u201cmeddl[ing] in internal affairs and Brazilian sovereignty\u201d after he spoke out over the Amazon fires crisis.\n\nIn July, Bachelet came under fire from the leftwing government of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro after a scathing UN report on its \u201cgrave violations of economic, social, civil, political and cultural rights.\u201d\n\nOliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation, said Bolsonaro\u2019s outburst could have an impact on his close relationship with Chile\u2019s conservative president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric will make it politically more costly for Pi\u00f1era to embrace this project,\u201d Stuenkel said, adding that it showed the more moderate wings in the Brazilian government \u201care unable to contain or moderate the president\u2019s rhetoric\u201d.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Pi\u00f1era distanced himself from Bolsonaro\u2019s comments. \u201cI don\u2019t share at all the reference president Bolsonaro made to a former Chilean president \u2013especially on a subject as painful as the death of her father,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nPi\u00f1era, who has faced cricisim in Chile for his ties to the far-right Brazilian leader said: \u201cWhatever different opinions there are over governments we had in the 70s and 80s, these must always be expressed with respect.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Jorge Poblete in Santiago\n\n", "description": "Brazilian president said without the dictator \u2018Chile would be a Cuba today\u2019 after Michelle Bachelet criticized rising police killings", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6b4a14be3ef465a7dfa3eb7112121478aaa21c/0_179_4786_2872/master/4786.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=425823ab1571acad0fad052184c9059c"}
