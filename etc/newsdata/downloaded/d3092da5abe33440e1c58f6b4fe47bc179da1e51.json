Per a new report from CNBC, Amazon has discussed the possibility with Cineworld, which owns Regal Cinemas, and OTG, which operates mini-grocery stores at some airports.\n\nConcession stands at stadiums and baseball parks are another area of interest, according to CNBC, with Amazon hoping it can retrofit Go technology into these partner locations in as little as two weeks and have \u201chundreds\u201d of stores using the scan-and-go checkout by the end of 2020.\n\nAmazon itself has opened 16 Go stores \u2014 18 have been announced in total \u2014 and they join the company\u2019s Amazon Books and Amazon 4-Star businesses to make up Amazon\u2019s physical retail operation. (And that\u2019s not even counting Whole Foods.) As CNBC notes, installing Go technology elsewhere would give Amazon another source of revenue without requiring the same commitment necessary to put up an entire store.\n\nBut it sounds like Amazon hasn\u2019t quite settled on how the financials will work. Here\u2019s CNBC\u2019s Jordan Novet:\n\nAmazon has explored different business models for its third-party Go strategy. The company looked at asking for a percentage of sales from the goods people purchase through the Go-equipped stores, or charging retailers up-front and then taking a monthly fee, two people said. It\u2019s not clear if the Amazon brand name will be visible on the Go hardware or which app customers would use to sign in.\n\nMovie theaters and airport shops are logical choices for cashier-free payment lanes. Both Regal and OTG declined to comment, so we don\u2019t know when this integration might kick off, if it does at all, beyond sometime next year.", "description": "Amazon is said to be in talks to license out the technology that powers its cashierless Amazon Go stores to other retailers.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACd-VDCFp60V_YyW6j092sFnTf4=/0x0:6720x3518/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19247232/1147597378.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
