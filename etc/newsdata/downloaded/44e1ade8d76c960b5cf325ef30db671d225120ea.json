He was 79 years old.\n\nFelderhof was the only person to face formal charges in the infamous gold mining fraud, but was acquitted of insider trading and other securities violations in 2007. The verdicts came ten years after the revelation that supposedly rich samples from Bre-X Minerals Ltd.\u2019s Indonesian mine had been \u201csalted\u201d with gold from outside the mine, a discovery that sent the miner\u2019s high-flying stock \u2014 the company was valued at $6 billion at its peak \u2014 into free fall.\n\nThe scandal shook Canada\u2019s capital markets along with the country\u2019s reputation on the global stage, as the supposedly enormous gold find had drawn interest from industry giants including U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan.\n\nFelderhof, the vice-chairman and chief geologist at Bre-X, had sold more than $80-million worth of his company\u2019s stock in 1996, not long before the fraud was exposed and wiped out hundreds of millions of dollars in shareholder value.\n\nHe faced charges of insider trading and authorizing misleading news releases, but the judge in the case ruled that the tampering that affected thousands of core samples was sophisticated, and that Felderhof could have reasonably believed there was a large gold deposit at the Busang mine.\n\nTwo of the other main players in the Bre-X saga had died by the time Felderhof was charged and faced trial. David Walsh, the company\u2019s chief executive, died of a brain aneurysm in 1998 at the age of 52. Geologist Michael de Guzman fell to his death from a helicopter in the Indonesian jungle in 1997, just a week before Freeport-McMoRan revealed it found \u201cinsignificant\u201d amounts of gold at the Bre-X mine.\n\nFelderhof never regained his career or reputation as a geologist after his acquittal, according to his Toronto lawyer Joe Groia, who successfully defended him against the charges levelled by the Ontario Securities Commission.\n\nOn Monday, Groia told the Financial Post it was a \u201cdifficult day\u201d for him after learning that Felderhof had died of natural causes in the Philippines.\n\n\u201cJohn was a man who I came to respect enormously for his tenacity and I always regretted not being able to do more for him,\u201d Groia said.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding his talents as a geologist, he never was able to work again in his field. And that leaves me feeling very sad for him, his family and the Canadian capital markets.\u201d\n\nFelderhof, who was born in Holland and had moved to Canada in his teens, was greeted \u201cwarmly but with great caution\u201d when he attended a large mining conference in Toronto following his acquittal, Groia said. Felderhof had moved to the Philippines around 2005, said the lawyer, who was told of Felderhof\u2019s death there by members of his family including his ex-wife.\n\nThe Bre-X scandal dominated the news in Canada as it unfurled, and led to class-action lawsuits from angry shareholders who had been pulled in by the junior miner\u2019s apparent discovery of one of the world\u2019s largest gold deposits deep in the Indonesian jungle.\n\nAfter the Indonesian government insisted the junior miner bring in a larger more experienced partner, Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. was among the industry heavyweights that vied for a piece of the project. Barrick lost out to Freeport-McMoRan and Barrick\u2019s then-CEO, Peter Munk, later told Felderhof\u2019s trial that he was shocked to learn there was no gold and that a fraud of such magnitude could happen in Canada.\n\nThe dramatic elements of the Bre-X story even captured Hollywood\u2019s attention, inspiring a 2017 movie called Gold that starred Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey as the CEO of fictitious Reno, Nev.-based Washoe Mining Inc.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com | Twitter: BatPost", "description": "Felderhof was the only person to face formal charges in the infamous fraud, but was acquitted of insider trading and other securities violations in 2007", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/felderhof.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
