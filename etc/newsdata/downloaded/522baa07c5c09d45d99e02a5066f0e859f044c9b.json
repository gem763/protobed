Airbus stock was priced at just over \u20ac119 per share on the French CAC-40 Tuesday morning.\n\nBoeing\u2019s current share price is $372 and has risen nearly 16 percent year-to-date.Airbus\u2019s range of jet planes is projected to \u201coutgrow\u201d Boeing\u2019s by 2024.\n\nAlso on rt.com WTO allows US to target EU goods in retaliation over Airbus subsidies\n\nAnalysts explained that by pointing to the US plane maker\u2019s grounded 737 MAX and the challenges faced in getting its new 777X into commercial service.\n\nAirbus\u2019s \u201cmore mature\u201d product range could guarantee smoother income, Barclays said, adding that free cash flow could triple from last year\u2019s \u20ac3 billion to around \u20ac9 billion in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe cash flow profile at Airbus is now becoming more predictable and robust compared with that of Boeing,\u201d said the bank.\n\nIt has calculated that when the two rival companies are stripped back to their commercial airplane divisions, current share prices imply Airbus is valued at a \u201cstriking\u201d 45 percent discount to that of Boeing\u2019s.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bye-bye Boeing: Russia\u2019s biggest airline cancels 787 Dreamliner order\n\nThe discount is undeserved and doesn\u2019t properly factor in Airbus\u2019s share of the single-aisle jet market, said Barclays.\n\n\u201cWe estimate the present value of the total narrow-body industry at $238 billion, which implies that a 50/50 split is worth 140 euros per share to Airbus \u2014 20 percent above Airbus\u2019 current share price.\u201d\n\nIt added Airbus\u2019s popular A321 jets alone should contribute \u20ac3.4 billion of free cash flow to the company over the next five years.\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "Airbus undervalued & looks more cash-rich than Boeing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da5dc7e85f540320460e157.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
