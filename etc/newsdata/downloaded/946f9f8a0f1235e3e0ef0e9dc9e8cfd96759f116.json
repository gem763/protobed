That summit was poised to set the stage for a meeting between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, as the two sides continue to work toward an at least partial trade agreement.\n\nHere were the main moves in markets, as of 10:21 a.m. ET:\n\nS&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) : -0.07%, or 2.31 points\n\nDow ( ^DJI ): +0.07%, or 19.55 points\n\nNasdaq ( ^IXIC ) : -0.12%, or 10.17 points\n\nWTI crude oil prices: ( CL=F ): -0.45% to $55.29 per barrel\n\n10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ): -2.3 bps to 1.812%\n\nGold (GC=F): +0.26% to $1,494.60 per ounce\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advance third-quarter GDP report at 8:30 a.m. ET, providing a snapshot on the health of the domestic economy during the July through September period. The results were better-than-expected, with a still-resilient consumer helping offset weakness in other areas of the economy.\n\nHeadline GDP rose at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.9% quarter-on-quarter, better than the 1.6% pace expected. This was still, however, a deceleration from the second quarter\u2019s 2.0% pace.\n\nPersonal consumption grew 2.9% in the third-quarter, also topping expectations for 2.6% growth. While still a moderation from the second quarter\u2019s 4.6% surge, the buoyancy of consumer spending still counterbalanced a second straight quarter of declines in business investments.\n\nThe vast majority of market pundits had expected the report would reflect a slowdown in U.S. economic activity amid weaker business investment trends and moderating consumer spending. Non-residential investment held in negative territory for a second straight quarter in the third quarter, falling 3.0%, or the most since late 2015.\n\nSeparately, a report from ADP/Moody\u2019s showed U.S. businesses added 125,000 private payrolls in October, topping expectations for a gain of 110,000.\n\nThe BEA\u2019s GDP report is one the last major pieces of economic data Federal Open Market Committee officials see before delivering their latest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday. Investors have priced in with all but certainty that central bankers will cut benchmark interest rates by a quarter-point for a third consecutive time this year.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 18, 2019.

But after this expected rate cut, the central bank\u2019s next move is much more opaque.\n\nSo far, markets have priced in an about 20% probability of a fourth rate cut in December \u2013 a relatively low percentage when compared to the high odds placed ahead of the past several cuts. At the conclusion of its September meeting, the Fed released its \u201cdot plot\u201d of projections for where rates were headed, showing that seven of the FOMC\u2019s 17 participants saw at least one more quarter-point rate cut by the end of 2019.\n\nWhile economic data releases Wednesday have pulled focus, corporate earnings season also continued to chug along.\n\nAhead of the opening bell, General Electric (GE) topped consensus expectations for quarterly sales and profit and boosted its guidance for closely watched industrial free cash flow for the year. The conglomerate, which is about a year into a turnaround plan led by CEO Larry Culp \u2013 said it expects as much as $2 billion in free cash flow this year, after previously projecting anywhere from negative to positive $1.0 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Airbus (AIR.PA) beat bottom-line expectations for the quarter, but the better-than-expected profit was overshadowed after the French plane-maker lowered full-year cash flow guidance. It said it expected to deliver about 20 fewer planes this year, as production challenges hit development of its A320neo aircraft, which competes directly with Boeing\u2019s (BA) narrow-body jets.", "description": "U.S. stocks were flat to slightly lower Wednesday morning as investors digested an estimates-topping third-quarter gross domestic product report and awaited the latest monetary policy decision from the Federal Reserve.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_qQ6XXMJtVwclUo7.uTDzQ--~B/aD0zODU5O3c9NTc4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/59a69720-fb0c-11e9-affb-892b73304903", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
