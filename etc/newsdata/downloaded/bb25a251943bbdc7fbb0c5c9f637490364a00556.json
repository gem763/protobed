But the court was unable to establish with certainty that the police were wrong to use lethal force.\n\nSweden grapples with fatal police shooting of man with Down's syndrome Read more\n\n\u201cIt may seem remarkable that the police fired a total of 25 shots at the time,\u201d the court\u2019s chief counsel, Erik Lindberg, said in a statement. \u201c[But] neither the medical nor the technical investigation has been able to establish the order of the shots or the man\u2019s detailed movements and body position when he was hit.\u201d\n\nThe trial centred on whether the police fired two fatal shots in Torell\u2019s back after he turned away from them, thereby ceasing to be a threat. A fourth officer, who emptied her weapon\u2019s magazine during the hail of bullets, was not charged because she was considered to have acted while Torell still represented a threat.\n\nThe case has raised questions about the readiness of police to resort to firearms as they battle escalating gang violence in Swedish cities. Police shot six people dead last year, an increase on previous years.\n\n\u201cWe have learned to be offensive. Forward, forward, until the perpetrator can no longer hurt others,\u201d an officer told a Swedish newspaper after the tragedy. \u201cIf that means he needs to be shot to death then so be it.\u201d\n\nEarly in the morning of 2 August 2018, Torell took a toy gun from his room and went outside to play. His condition meant he moved slowly and clumsily, according to his mother. He behaved like a three-year-old and could speak only one word: mum.\n\nBystanders alerted police that an armed man was on the street. Officers feared that it might be a local suspect known to them who had violently attacked his partner and threatened to kill her, so they assumed they were hunting a potential killer.\n\nUnknown to them, however, this man had been arrested months before and was awaiting trial. The information was not in the police database.\n\nAs they approached the scene, the police met Torrell\u2019s father, who was out looking for his son. They spoke, but neither realised that Torell was the cause of alarm.\n\nTorell\u2019s mother, Katarina S\u00f6derberg, said she accepted the court\u2019s verdict but said the police must change how they respond to emergency situations.\n\n\u201cI hope that we learn the lessons and look ahead to see what must change in order to safeguard all our children and young people with developmental and intellectual disabilities who are out in the community among us,\u201d S\u00f6derberg told Swedish media.\n\nIt had been widely expected that the officers would walk free from the court. It is extremely rare for Swedish police to be sentenced for using their weapons during active service.\n\nKarl Johan Thulin and Hans Christian Appelgren had been charged with misconduct, and Hannes Erik B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m was charged with negligence causing another\u2019s death.\n\nThe ammunition used by Swedish police expands on contact, causing severe injuries, in order to stop the target quickly and prevent the bullets from exiting the person\u2019s body and possibly injuring someone else. Photographs from the scene showed trees deeply gouged by bullets that missed their target.\n\nOne member of the jury disagreed with the verdict, believing the two policemen who fired the lethal shots should be found guilty.\n\nAnton Strand, a lawyer for one of the freed police officers, said the court\u2019s decision \u201cdoes not make the tragedy any less. Nobody wanted this to go so wrong.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor Martin Tid\u00e9n said he reserved the right to appeal against the verdict.", "description": "Officers fired 25 shots at Eric Torell in August 2018 as he played with a toy gun", "authors": ["David Crouch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc77b45709cfa6cd1a53f6e78f05602462127b38/0_171_5276_3165/master/5276.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0364dad10fe605ad7989dd399e13f07b"}
