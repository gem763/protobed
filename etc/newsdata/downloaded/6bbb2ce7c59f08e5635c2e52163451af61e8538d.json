The Kurdish administration invited the Syrian military in to shield it from the Turkish attack.\n\nA day ahead of a visit by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to Ankara, tasked with negotiating out an end to the attack, the Kremlin said Erdogan had accepted an invitation by Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit Russia \u201cin coming days\u201d to discuss Syria.\n\nRussia has moved quickly to further entrench its leadership role in the region after President Donald Trump ordered the pullout of American forces in northeastern Syria. The American move effectively abandoned the Kurdish fighters who were allied with the U.S. and cleared the way for Turkey\u2019s invasion aimed at crushing them. After heavy criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, Washington then scrambled to find new leverage with the Turks, imposing economic sanctions aimed at forcing a cease-fire\n\nErdogan told reporters Wednesday that he had \u201cno problem\u201d with visiting Russia. But he suggested a planned Nov. 13 trip to Washington was now uncertain due to calls within the U.S. Congress to sanction Turkey.\n\nThe trip \u201cis something to be assessed\u201d after the talks with the American delegation, he said, adding that the sanctions and criticisms in the U.S. constituted \u201cgreat disrespect toward the Turkish Republic.\u201d\n\nIn an address to his ruling party legislators, Erdogan said Turkey would not be coerced into stopping its offensive or accept offers for a mediation with the Kurdish fighters, which Turkey considers as terrorists. He vowed to press ahead with the incursion until Turkish troops reach a depth of 30 to 35 kilometers (18-20 miles) inside Syria along a border area where Turkey intends to form a \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur proposal is for the terrorists to lay down their arms, leave their equipment, destroy the traps they have created and leave the safe zone we as designated, as of tonight,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cIf this is done, our Operation Peace Spring will end by itself.\u201d\n\nPence is joined in his Turkey visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, aiming to negotiate a stop to the fighting in Syria\u2019s northeast.\n\nErdogan ruled out direct or indirect talks with the Kurdish fighters, saying Turkey will not negotiate with \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not looking for a peace mediator nor do we need one,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the Turkish assault in its eighth day, Turkish forces and Kurdish fighters were still battling heavily Wednesday over the border town of Ras al-Ayn. Turkey had announced it captured the town days ago, but its hold now appeared uncertain amid Kurdish incursion.\n\nAmerica\u2019s abrupt withdrawal of its troops pushed the Kurds to strike a deal with the Russia-backed government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, allowing its forces to return to regions of northern Syria it had abandoned at the height of the eight-year-old civil war.\n\nIt has also allowed Moscow to take a more prominent role as an interlocutor among Assad, the former U.S.-allied Kurds and the U.S.\u2019s NATO ally Turkey.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is committed to mediating between the Syrian government and Turkey.\n\nRussia has already announced it had deployed troops outside the flashpoint town of Manbij to keep apart the Syrian military and Turkish-led forces. Syrian forces took control of Manbij as U.S. troops completed their pull-out from the town on Tuesday. The Syrian and Russian deployments appear to have thwarted Turkey\u2019s hopes to capture the town, located just west of the Euphrates, in its offensive.\n\nLavrov also said Moscow will also continue to encourage Syria\u2019s Kurds and government to seek rapprochement following the U.S. withdrawal. The Kurds are hoping to reach a deal with Damascus that preserves at least some degree of the autonomy they seized for themselves amid Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nDuring a visit to Iraq last week, Lavrov met with the leaders of the Kurdish autonomous region and said that Moscow is sympathetic to their need for autonomy.\n\nLavrov also blamed the United States and Western nations for undermining the Syrian state, saying this pushed \u201cthe Kurds toward separatism and confrontation with Arab tribes.\u201d\n\nIn another sign of Moscow\u2019s rising profile, France suggested it will also work more closely with Russia in Syria.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian said in an interview on French television channel BFM Wednesday that France is notably now looking to Russia, given their \u201ccommon interests\u201d in defeating the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nHe called on European and other members of the coalition fighting the IS in Syria to regroup as the U.S. appeared to abdicate its leadership role in the region.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report.", "description": "CEYLANPINAR, Turkey (AP) \u2014 As Russia and the United States each launched diplomatic forays to end Turkey's invasion of northern Syria, Turkish President", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/a1b021_turkey-syria-25948-news-cameraman-works-on-hilltop-in-ceylanpinar-sanliurfa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
