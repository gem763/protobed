Earlier this week, after a nearly five year-long manhunt, Peter Chadwick was captured in Mexico.\n\nThe 55-year-old is accused of strangling his wife, Quee Choo \"Q.C.\" Chadwick to death in 2012 in their Newport Beach mansion.\n\n\"48 Hours\" gained exclusive insight into the U.S. Marshals' search for Chadwick, who was charged with killing his wife and then jumped bail.\n\nPeter and Q.C. Chadwick were college sweethearts, married for 21 years and had three sons. They lived in a gated community in Newport Beach, Calif. That dream life collapsed one day in 2012 when neither of the Chadwicks turned up to pick up their sons from the bus stop. Investigators had little idea that day the search for the couple would lead them on an international manhunt.\n\nThe next morning, San Diego authorities got a 911 call from Chadwick, claiming a house painter named Juan murdered Q.C. and forced Peter Chadwick to get her body out of the house. He said a man helped Juan and they were planning to cut up his wife's body and dispose of it south of the border. Law enforcement didn't believe Chadwick, and he was arrested and charged with Q.C.'s murder. He was released on $1 million in bail. Then he vanished. That was 2015.\n\nChadwick was one of the U.S. Marshals' 15 most-wanted fugitives.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey told \"48 Hours\" that a previous edition of the broadcast \u2013 which aired in May \u2013 focused on the case caused Chadwick to alter his life while on the run and ultimately helped lead to his capture.\n\n\"He said when he saw that episode, he realized his situation had escalated a lot,\" McCluskey told correspondent Tracy Smith. \"Because he didn't realize the U.S. Marshals were after him at that point.\"\n\nHow was Chadwick able to elude those trying to find him for so long? And what happens next?\n\nAfter nearly five years on the run, the international manhunt for Peter Chadwick -- accused of killing his wife Q.C. -- ended on August 4.\n\n\"48 Hours\" had the only news crew on scene when Peter Chadwick, who disappeared in 2015 after he was charged with killing his wife, landed in Los Angeles. CBS News\n\nCHIEF JON LEWIS | NEWPORT BEACH POLICE [to reporters]: We're pleased to announce that Peter Gregory Chadwick was located in Mexico on Sunday night \u2026 With the help and cooperation of the United States Marshal's Office and authorities in Mexico, he was flown to Los Angeles International Airport where our detectives took custody of him.\n\nHow did it come to this? It's a twisted tale that began on a picture-perfect autumn day in October 2012, in a posh neighborhood in Newport Beach, California.\n\nThe couple had been living the good life, enjoying the trappings of wealth and raising three sons. Their oldest was away at boarding school and when his two younger brothers returned home on Oct. 10, the family's world turned upside down.\n\nTracy Smith: So, these boys got out of school and what happened?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters | Newport Beach Police Dept.: They get out of school and a bus drops 'em off at a bus stop near their house.\n\nSergeant Ryan Peters remembers that day.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And a neighbor saw 'em sittin' at the bus stop past the time that they typically get picked up by either Peter or Q.C.. ... So, she stopped and asked, \"Have you reached your mom and dad?\" And they said, \"No, they haven't been able to reach 'em.\" They were calling them, and nobody was answering.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore | Newport Beach Police Dept.: It was very unusual for the Chadwicks not to be punctual.\n\nLieutenant Bryan Moore was called in later.\n\nTracy Smith: Dad should be here to pick them up?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Dad is always here.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Normal protocol during a missing persons case is we're \u2026 checking with friends, we're checking with relatives.\n\nTracy Smith: And checking the hospitals, checking with family, neighbors \u2014 anybody have any idea where they are?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: All attempts to locate them were \u2014 were a dead end.\n\nThat same night, with their parents still missing, the boys slept at a friend's house. Investigators combed the Chadwick home for clues.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And then when they go upstairs and they walk into the master bath \u2026 then that's when patrol realizes there's more to the story.\n\nBroken glass found in the tub of the Chadwick's upstairs master bathroom Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: In the master bathroom, they initially saw the broken glass. ...Decorative glass that was around the bathroom tub, the edging.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: We had blood at the bottom of the bathtub.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: As you continue through the downstairs ... the safe is clearly ajar.\n\nTracy Smith: So, it's starting to look like more than just a welfare check situation.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Yeah. Obviously, whoever left, left in haste. ... It looked quite suspicious.\n\nHeidi | Neighbor: We were all in shock. Like \"Where is she? What's going on? Why is she missing?\"\n\nWord that the Chadwicks were gone spread quickly through the neighborhood. Heidi lived just across the street.\n\nQ.C. Chadwick, a devoted mom to three sons, was described as having a \"bubbly personality.\" \"She was very funny,\" said friend Karen Thorp. \"And so smart and talented, she could do anything.\" Of Peter Chadwick, Thorp said, \"I felt like I never really knew him very well.\"\n\nTracy Smith: What were they like?\n\nHeidi: Well, Q.C. was the one with all the personality. ... She was always looking forward to my annual Christmas party, because she came over and she got to dress up. And she looked like a million dollars. And she had fun!\n\nKaren Thorp | Q.C.'s friend: My first impression of her was that she was a completely devoted mother.\n\nKaren Thorp had known Q.C. for years. Their children went to school together.\n\nKaren Thorp: She was... very determined to make sure they were getting good grades and they were completing their assignments, and they were taking music and were doing a sport. She wanted them to be the best at everything.\n\nTracy Smith: And, how were they?\n\nKaren Thorp: They were the best at everything.\n\nTheir father, Peter, came from a wealthy family. He was born in Britain and had dual citizenship. Q.C.'s family was also affluent. They met at Arizona State University.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you get the sense that she was very in love with him?\n\nKaren Thorp: Yes. That she was in love with him and that she depended on him also\u2026\n\nTracy Smith: What do you mean depended on him?\n\nKaren Thorp: Q.C. found our country to be a bit new and strange, different from where she had come from and she was learning about how to do things here.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you get the sense that Peter liked her depending on him?\n\nKaren Thorp: Yes. Yeah, we definitely all felt that he was completely comfortable with that. \u2026 She was definitely less independent than many of her friends.\n\nQ.C. and Peter married in 1991. When he grew more successful, the couple moved to that home in Newport Beach. They eventually had three sons.\n\nArt Scott taught the two older boys piano.\n\nArt Scott: They were great students \u2026 They did everything I asked.\n\nArt Scott: I would teach him [plays a tune on the piano]. Then after a few months, after he got a bit more advanced, I would teach him \u2026 [plays an extended tune]. And it would expand beyond that as he got more committed and did more work. \u2026 They were very bright kids.\n\nArt Scott: I really enjoyed being in their home. She always had a beverage for me, and something to eat every single time. And that doesn't happen, you know, every day of \u2014 for all the clients that I see. \u2026 And so, she was very congenial, very much \u2014 making me feel warm in her house.\n\nTracy Smith: And what was Peter like?\n\nKaren Thorp: He almost seemed painfully shy when we first met him. \u2026 I felt like I never really knew him very well.\n\nTracy Smith: What did Peter do?\n\nKaren Thorp: At first, we didn't really know. We thought he ran his own business and we then learned he managed some apartment buildings.\n\nTracy Smith: Was Peter kind of a mystery?\n\nKaren Thorp: Yes. Peter was a mystery.\n\nBut, Thorp says, she did sense that the couple's dynamic had been evolving over the past few years.\n\nKaren Thorp: Q.C. was really beginning to come into her own and be her own person.\n\nKaren Thorp: I'd say she was less insecure about what to wear and what to do and she was able to follow more of her way of doing things.\n\nTracy Smith: So, you could see the self-confidence?\n\nKaren Thorp: I could see the self-confidence, yes.\n\nKaren Thorp: I felt at the time like I really knew the family, but I have to say, with so many things in life, you never really know about peoples' inside lives and what's really going on.\n\nNow, police were left with two missing parents and those disturbing clues in the master bathroom.\n\nTracy Smith: And what were the boys saying?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: The boys had no idea where mom and dad were.\n\nTracy Smith: Anybody have any clue?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: No. At that point, nobody had any clue at all.\n\nBut that wouldn't last long. The first big break came near the Mexican border in San Diego. It was just before dawn the day after when someone there \u2014 100 miles from Newport Beach \u2014 called 911 with an emergency. It was Peter Chadwick:\n\n911 OPERATOR: 911 Emergency. This is Crystal\u2026 PETER CHADWICK: They took her\u2026 they took her 911 OPERATOR: Who took her? PETER CHADWICK: The guy who broke into my house. He \u2014 he drove me here. He had a friend ... I think they're going \u2014 they might be going to Mexico or somewhere.\n\nA BIZARRE 911 CALL\n\nIn surveillance pictures taken at a gas station near the Mexican border, Peter Chadwick can be seen \u2014 he's about to make that 911 call:\n\nPeter Chadwick is seen in surveillance pictures taken at a gas station near the Mexican border. Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nPETER CHADWICK [TO STORE CLERK]: Can you call 911? Somebody killed my wife.\n\nMoments later, Chadwick tells the operator Q.C. had been murdered:\n\nPETER CHADWICK: My wife's dead ... They've gone in a pickup truck. 911 OPERATOR: So, your wife was kidnapped? PETER CHADWICK: She's dead ... 911 OPERATOR: Uh, hold on. Let me get my supervisor on the phone.\n\nPeter Chadwick to 911: \"My wife's dead ... They took her!\"\n\nTracy Smith: This is the gas station where Chadwick called 911?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Yeah. This is where he chose to kick off our investigation.\n\nTracy Smith: And this was a huge break\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: This was huge.\n\nTracy Smith: Just to get a sense of where we are, how close are we to the border \u2014 is that?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters [pointing to city lights in the distance]: It's right there.\n\nTracy Smith: What are we looking at?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: We're looking at Tijuana.\n\nTracy Smith: What did Chadwick tell 911?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Chadwick calls 911 and says he was kidnapped. And he was kidnapped by a guy named Juan who had killed his wife in Newport Beach.\n\n911 OPERATOR: How do you know Juan? PETER CHADWICK: I picked him up to look at some painting work at the house. I brought him to the house.\n\n\n\nTracy Smith: So, Peter and Juan go back to his home \u2026 and then what did Peter say happened?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: At some point Peter and Juan separated, Juan continued upstairs, and Peter went down to his office ... Peter said within seconds, he heard his wife Q.C. screaming.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He hears Q.C. scream \"Peter, Peter...\" and as he runs upstairs he sees Juan strangling Q.C., who's in the bath, in their master bedroom and he's drowning her.\n\n911 OPERATOR: How do you know she's dead? PETER CHADWICK: She drowned, she drowned. ... Her body was stiff, even!\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: As he goes up and sees this, witnesses this, he's being held at bay by Juan with a 2-inch pocket knife.\n\nChadwick told police he was helpless to save Q.C.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Instead of being able to rescue his wife he's held at bay by Juan and Juan proceeds to finish killing his wife.\n\nThen, Chadwick said Juan ordered him to help get Q.C.'s body out of the tub and wrap it in a blanket.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And Peter says he walks over and grabs a green blanket and wraps her up in it. And that's the blanket they used to take her downstairs.\n\nWith Juan at his side, Chadwick said he was forced to drive all through the night with his wife's body in the back of his SUV.\n\nPETER CHADWICK [TO 911]: I've been driving with them. PETER CHADWICK [TO 911]: I think they might be going to Mexico or somewhere. \u2026 I want you to get 'em \u2026\n\nChadwick says that's how they ended up at a border town gas station, where they met up with another man named \"Chee.\"\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And they took the body out of Chadwick's car, put it in a truck and took it to Mexico.\n\nChadwick says Juan and Chee drove away, leaving him alone with his vehicle in a dreary parking lot. That's when Chadwick made his 911 call:\n\n911 OPERATOR: OK, and where is she now? PETER CHADWICK: They have her body. They said they're gonna cut her up. 911 OPERATOR: What color car did Juan leave in? PETER CHADWICK: Wha \u2014 What? 911 OPERATOR: What color car did Juan leave in? PETER CHADWICK: Dark green. Dark green uh, umm, like a \u2014 like a pickup van but covered. Um what do you call, uh, umm. And \u2014 and a \u2014 a Chevy.\n\n\n\nWithin a few minutes, police arrived and took him to the station. Lieutenant Bryan Moore says his detectives found holes in Chadwick's story.\n\nTracy Smith: Any signs of Juan at all?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: No.\n\nPeter Chadwick told 911 that his wife was killed at about 11 a.m. the previous morning, but surveillance footage shows Chadwick's SUV leaving his gated community in Newport Beach at 1:32 p.m. \u2014 about 2.5 hours later. Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nChadwick told 911 that Q.C. was killed at about 11 a.m. the previous morning, but surveillance footage shows Chadwick's SUV leaving his gated community in Newport Beach about two-and-a-half hours after that. Police say there's no Juan in the vehicle. And later, Chadwick's at a toll. Again, no sign of Juan.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Everyone we talked to and described this Juan individual, no one had any idea who that was, or could give us any information related to this person.\n\nTracy Smith: What about Chee?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: No. Some of the video surveillance we picked up, in the area where Peter said he met this Chee person, there was no other vehicles involved that we could see.\n\nWhat's more, Chadwick's own body had some incriminating injuries.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He had scratches on his neck and his arms. You know, bite mark on his forearm.\n\nPeter Chadwick's own body had some incriminating injuries. Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nTracy Smith: Did he try to explain that as these came from Juan?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: He explained some sort of a struggle between him and Juan, but there was never any specifics on how he obtained those injuries\n\nAnd then there was this: a packed suitcase in Chadwick's car.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: We had a suitcase with \u2026 all male clothing inside that was just kind of thrown in there, as if somebody had kind of packed hastily.\n\nTracy Smith: I'm sorry \u2014 there was a bag in the car of men's clothes?\n\nTracy Smith: What kind of kidnapper says, \"Hey, go ahead and pack yourself an overnight bag?\"\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Which is part of the problem. That's not normally a thing that happens, no.\n\nQ.C.'s friend, Karen Thorp, says nothing Peter said made any sense.\n\nTracy Smith: When you first heard that story, did you buy it?\n\nKaren Thorp: Absolutely, not! I don't even think the 911 operator bought it! If you've heard the tape her reaction is, \"Um-hmm, really? Um-hmm?\"\n\n911 OPERATOR: OK, wh \u2014 what?\u2014 are you on any kind of medication, sir? PETER CHADWICK: \u2026Not \u2014 not \u2014 not, uh, that heavy one ... 911 OPERATOR: OK, but this happened yesterday at 11. You're now calling us at 5:30 in the morning.\n\nDetectives weren't buying any of it either.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: During the initial contact \u2026 Peter was \u2014 was kind of all over the map. His story was very disjointed. He'd go through the range of emotions, crying \u2014 however, the officer never saw a tear \u2014 to moments of anxiety and just complete quiet.\n\nTracy Smith: So, he went from great displays of being distraught to nothing?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: And the most interesting thing was during the entire contact with law enforcement and with our detectives, he never once asked about his kids.\n\nTracy Smith: He never asked about the boys?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: No.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And we're talking, he hasn't seen them since the morning prior when he dropped them off for school. ... So, it's almost 24 hours.\n\nTracy Smith: What did that say to you?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: To me, it means that he is more concerned with his story, creating an alibi \u2014\n\nTracy Smith: \u2014 than he is about his own sons.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: It appeared so, yes.\n\nKaren Thorp: People's first feeling was that there had been a takeover robbery and they had both been kidnapped I don't know if there was speculation in the media about that. \u2026 [emotional] But I never for a moment thought that it had happened. I somehow knew he had killed her.\n\nA BIG BREAK\n\nKaren Thorp: I remember calling and I said, \"He's killed her, hasn't he?\" And I can't tell you why I knew. My friend said, \"Are you OK? Are you at work?\" And I said, \"I am, but I'm going home now.\"\n\nOn Oct. 11, 2012 \u2014 just six hours after that 911 call \u2014 Peter Chadwick was arrested for murder.\n\nPeter Chadwick was arrested for Q.C.'s murder Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He wasn't defensive, angry, sad, emotional in any way as if somebody that was being placed under arrest that was innocent would have acted.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Almost like he wasn't surprised that we were putting the handcuffs on him.\n\nChadwick quickly lawyered up and stopped talking to detectives. The community was shocked.\n\nKaren Thorp: Just, just unthinkable that, that he would do that and that someone would do that, and that she would be gone.\n\nKaren Thorp could only guess what led to her friend's murder.\n\nKaren Thorp: I think, over time, knowing Q.C., it seemed that she wanted to become more independent and she would start doing more things for herself \u2026 and I wondered then if maybe some of her reservations and insecurity were because of Peter.\n\nTracy Smith: Why do you think she didn't confide in you?\n\nKaren Thorp: I think she was very proud ... and I think everyone was shocked.\n\nBryan Moore believes Q.C. had uncovered a dark side of her husband.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Probably the most telling things that we discovered was a handwritten piece of paper that had Peter's computer search history on it. Looked like it was written out by Q.C..\n\nTracy Smith: And what did that say?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: How to torture, Chinese sex massage, abortion costs in Orange County.\n\nTracy Smith: These were all in his search history?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Yes.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: So, as we dug into it further. We started to get the real account that there was some turmoil in their marriage. There was some talk of divorce.\n\nTracy Smith: He visited prostitutes?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Based on his search history \u2026 we have to assume so.\n\nTracy Smith: This isn't that happy Newport Beach family that it appeared to be from the outside?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Absolutely, not.\n\nIn court, Peter Chadwick pleaded not guilty. His two sons, who had lived at home, were now with their mother's brother more than 50 miles away in the Los Angeles area. Their mother was missing and presumably dead.\n\nTracy Smith: Did the boys have any idea about what happened to their mother? What their dad was doing?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: None whatsoever.\n\nThen, seven days after Peter Chadwick called 911, detectives got another big break. This time, a tip they say they can't discuss, that led them to a location in the mountains, more than 100 miles from Newport Beach.\n\nTracy Smith: This is remote.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: It's extremely remote. \u2026 Kind of south San Diego County, in the middle of nowhere.\n\nTracy Smith: Where are we headed?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: So, we're going to crime scene number two.\n\nDetectives found themselves on a barren mountainside in rural San Diego County: Wildcat Canyon. They believe Peter Chadwick came here that night.\n\nTracy Smith: What do you think he's thinking of as he's driving up this road?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: If you kind of put yourself in his position, he's been driving around for hours, over 10 hours with Q.C.'s body in the car. \u2026 He needs to find a place to drop the body. He needs to find a place to drop the body where he's not gonna be seen. Where it's dark and it's not gonna be seen anytime soon after he drops it.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: The first place he comes to is this little road.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: We were not sure we were ever gonna find her. \u2026The chances were slim to none.\n\nThat's where they came upon a dumpster.\n\nOn a barren mountainside in rural San Diego County, investigators came upon this dumpster. Among the items they found inside of it: bags of Q.C.'s belongings, $10,000 in cash and her body wrapped in a green blanket Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: When we lifted it up it was full.\n\nTracy Smith: So, what did you see?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: We started finding Q.C.'s items. \u2026 We found nice bags. \u2026 We found a really nice purse. \u2026 So, we set those aside. \u2026 When we opened up the bag, that's when we found Q.C.'s ID; her permanent residency card; $10,000 cash. \u2026 And all of this stuff is the stuff that he described Juan taking with Q.C.'s body into Mexico.\n\nAnd wrapped in a green blanket: Q.C.'s body.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: It was huge break for us. \u2026 The dumpster was scheduled to be picked up the Thursday morning, which was the next morning after we believe Peter disposed of Q.C.'s body. \u2026 The issue with that was there was some kind of billing dispute.\n\nTracy Smith: So, they were supposed to pick up the dumpster \u2026 but they didn't.\n\nOnce detectives finally found Q.C., the medical examiner was able to determine how she died.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: There was a pretty violent struggle which resulted in strangulation and possible drowning.\n\nAs the state built its case against Peter Chadwick, he sat in jail for two months, until December, when bail was set at $1 million. No sweat for the multimillionaire businessman.\n\nKaren Thorp: I heard he got out on bail \u2026 and I remember being absolutely infuriated and disgusted. He should not be out on bail.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy says the court really had no choice. Chadwick was entitled to bail.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy | Orange County Senior Deputy D.A.: We had a guy that had \u2014 he had no criminal background. He had roots in the community.\n\nChadwick also had that multimillion-dollar home and three sons. And he surrendered his U.S. and U.K. passports.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy: We can keep him on a short leash. We can keep him, you know, engaged in the process. We can keep, you know, we can keep eyes on him.\n\nHeidi: Peter came back and got her van, which was really creepy. \u2026 He returned to get her van, because his car was impounded. So he drove off with her van. \u2026 And I was just happened to be out on the street, and he gave me a nod and I'm just like, turned my head in disgust.\n\nEven before Chadwick could face trial, Karen Thorp's mind was made up.\n\nKaren Thorp: He was \u2013 shameless \u2026 Talk about chutzpah. He sent out an email inviting people to a 100-day vigil, candlelight vigil, at the home where he murdered her. \u2026 How can you kill your wife \u2026 throw her in a dumpster \u2026 and hold a candle light vigil at the home where you killed her?\n\nTwo years passed. Chadwick moved into his father's home in Santa Barbara, a swanky town up the coast. All three sons ended up in boarding school.\n\nTracy Smith: How solid did you think your case was as you headed for trial?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Extremely solid. \u2026 I mean with all the circumstantial evidence, the body \u2026 the injuries \u2026 and the lack of plausibility on behalf of Peter's story. \u2026 So overall, we thought we had this thing wrapped up.\n\nTracy Smith: So as you're looking down the road, you're thinking Peter Chadwick is gonna end up where?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: In prison.\n\nBut Peter Chadwick had other plans.\n\nDISAPPEARING ACT\n\nPeter Chadwick was awaiting trial and making his court appearances for hearings, doing what he was supposed to do.\n\nTracy Smith: \u2026 until he wasn't anymore.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Yeah \u2026 we got word from his attorney \u2026 that said \u2026 \"I don't know where he is.\"\n\nAfter two years out on bail, Peter Chadwick disappeared.\n\nNEWS REPORT: This is one of the most wanted suspects in the entire United States \u2026\n\nHeidi: What do you mean he's gone? You know, didn't somebody keep an eye on this guy?\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy was outraged.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy: Nobody thought that he would flee from his sons.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy: He abandoned his family \u2026 he made his attorney look terrible, and \u2026 he thumbed his nose at the court and the justice system.\n\nTracy Smith: Is part of this just that rich guys can get away with an awful lot?\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy [Takes a deep breath]: You know, it's -- it's just -- it's frustrating. \u2026 You shouldn't be able to take advantage of the system because you have money. And you know, that's what happened here. Most people can't afford this bail. You shouldn't be able to do this because you got money. \u2026 He took full advantage and he used his financial resources to do it.\n\nKaren Thorp: A million dollars bail really wasn't enough to keep someone as cold hearted and narcissistic as him to stay around.\n\nAt first, investigators heard that Peter Chadwick might be dead.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Initially, Michael Chadwick started relaying information that he was suicidal.\n\nTracy Smith: So, Michael Chadwick, Peter's dad, said he was gonna kill himself? That Peter was gonna kill himself?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He alluded to the fact that he was suicidal.\n\nKaren Thorp: I don't know if it was his attorney or his father had said he had been despondent and suicidal. No.\n\nBy the time investigators realized that he'd flown the coop, Chadwick was long gone. He had a three-week lead on them, and he'd been studying up.\n\nThey discovered books in Chadwick's home on how to disappear and how to change identities and leave false trails.\n\nInvestigators learned from a taxi company that someone \u2013 who police now believe was Peter Chadwick \u2013 took a cab from his dad's house to an airport in Santa Barbara. The cab driver says that the person he picked up that day was a woman. Was Peter Chadwick in disguise?\n\nWhen he got to the Santa Barbara Airport, he went inside with his suitcase and then he must have changed clothes, because surveillance cameras have pictures of Chadwick dressed as himself hanging out at the airport.\n\nPeter Chadwick is seen on surveillance video at the Santa Barbara Airport U.S. Marshals\n\nHours ticked by, but he never got on a plane. Instead, Chadwick went back outside, got into another cab, and drove away. And that's the last anyone here saw of Peter Chadwick.\n\nThe search for Chadwick was now an international manhunt with the U.S. Marshals leading the way.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey led the team that would track Chadwick.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: We're gonna catch him. \u2026He's gonna make a mistake. We're gonna choke him off \u2026 and grab him.\n\nNot only did Chadwick have a head start \u2013 his life on the run would be well-financed.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: What makes him so difficult to find is the fact that he fled with a decent amount of money.\n\nTracy Smith: So, it was about a million dollars that he had in cash when he left?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: Approximately a million dollars, yes.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you feel like he slipped through your fingers?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore [exhales]: Yeah. I honestly wished, uh, you know, we could have wrapped this case up a lot sooner.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He got the better of us, at this point.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: Once you find a string, you gotta start pulling on it. And, uh, we found a couple strings.\n\nBefore the final tip that led investigators to Mexico, tips had come from everywhere.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: The countries that we've had active leads in that we've pursued include Japan \u2026 they include Canada \u2026 Belize \u2026 Panama \u2026 the Ukraine.\n\nMcCluskey was convinced Chadwick was getting help while on the lam.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: I didn't think this case was gonna turn into what it did. But I think one reason that it did is not because Peter's smart. It's not because he was savvy. It's not because he outsmarted us, it's because he's getting help. I think once we cut him off from his source of help that he's gonna make a mistake and we're gonna catch him.\n\nKaren Thorp had always hoped whoever was helping Peter Chadwick might have a change of heart.\n\nKaren Thorp: Someone needs to come forward. Someone with a conscience. Someone who cares about those kids and who cares about what has happened to this lovely woman. This lovely, devoted mother who has no justice.\n\nBut justice would be in reach -- when the manhunt ended south of the border, and the millionaire murder suspect was taken into custody.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: You know, a fugitive, he has to be lucky every single day of his life. We only have to be lucky once. \u2026 The day he got arrested is the day we got lucky.\n\nCAPTURED\n\nAfter almost five years, basically overnight, everything changed. Late on Sunday, August 4, \"48 Hours\" learned of a new dramatic development in the Peter Chadwick investigation.\n\nAccused killer Peter Chadwick captured after years-long international manhunt\n\nIn handcuffs and shackles, authorities had their man and Newport Beach Police Chief Jon Lewis made the official announcement:\n\nCHIEF JON LEWIS | NEWPORT BEACH POLICE [to reporters]: After receiving hundreds and hundreds of tips from all over the world, one of them led to our suspect \u2026\n\nThe chief would not go into detail about what that tip was. Chadwick was picked up by Mexican federal police near the city of Puebla, south of Mexico City.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: I think he was surprised. I don't think he expected to be arrested.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey was at the airport in Los Angeles when Chadwick arrived, and he slapped the cuffs on him.\n\nTracy Smith: What's the first thing you said to him?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: Peter\u2026my name is Craig McCluskey. I'm from the US Marshals. I'm placing you in the custody of the United States Marshal Service.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: I think he actually recognized me from the \"48 Hours\" episode that aired.\n\nTracy Smith: Whoa -- he watched the \"48 Hours\" episode?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: I believe he did.\n\n\"48 Hours\"' report on the hunt for Peter Chadwick, aired in May. McCluskey told \"48 Hours\" at the time he was confident Chadwick would be found. \"I think it's only a matter of time. And I think that day is coming soon,\" he said.\n\nTracy Smith: And he recognized you from the \"48 Hours?\"\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: Cause the first question he asked -- he looked me right in the face and he asked me, \"How's Ben?\" And Ben's his oldest son. \u2026 I guess he assumed I had some contact with his family.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: He said when he saw the episode, he realized his situation had escalated a lot. Because he didn't realize the U.S. Marshals were after him at that point.\n\nTracy Smith: So, he was watching us watching him?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: In essence, yes.\n\nTracy Smith: And he knew people were coming after him. He'd seen the coverage.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: He became really stressed out. That's an incredible weight. Looking over your shoulder every day.\n\nDetails are still murky about where Chadwick spent all his years on the run, but when he was picked up in Mexico he was living in an apartment.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: Peter was in a small village outside of Puebla Mexico, about two hours north of the Guatemalan border and about an hour and half south of Mexico City. The makeup of the town was mostly Caucasians, but also and Asian community as well.\n\nHis hideout was next to a country club.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: That had tennis courts and, of course, you know, Peter preferred playing tennis.\n\nTracy Smith: So, he continued to play tennis?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: Yes.\n\nTracy Smith: Did he change his appearance?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: He changed his appearance slightly. So, his hair was a little darker. He had some facial hair. He had a goatee. He tried to make himself a little younger, and I think he was successful at that \u2013 I mean his face looked a little different as well.\n\nTracy Smith: A little nip and tuck in Mexico?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: Possibly. I don't know for sure.\n\nPolice offer glimpse of captured murder suspect Peter Chadwick's life on the run\n\nChadwick apparently used many fake ids and aliases, including \"Paul Cook,\" \"Paul Craig\" and \"John Franklin.\"\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: He even had an ID card. It was a copy of some fictional security force. And he was representing himself as some type of analyst with top secret access\u2026with his photo on it\u2026\n\nBut, strangely, Chadwick never got a fake passport and that may have forced him into some lifestyle changes. He had started off his escape staying in nice hotels.\n\nTracy Smith: And he stayed at some fancy hotels in the beginning?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: He did stay at hotels. But I think he started to change his pattern when Mexico started changing some of their immigration laws \u2013 whether they required visas for non-citizens when they checked into hotels. \u2026 Which forced him into, you know, more discreet places that would accept cash and no identification.\n\nThe apartment where Peter Chadwick was living, left window at top, in San Andr\u00e9s Cholula, Pueblo, Mexico, when he was caught.\n\nAnd then there was money. Even though authorities figure he had about a million dollars in cash when he fled, he occupied his days by picking up odd jobs.\n\nTracy Smith What was he doing for money?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: He did flee with a large sum of money. \u2026 Most of that he lived off it. But I think he did some small things on the side, maybe taught conversational English to children to make a few extra bucks. \u2026 He was bussing tables, working in kitchens.\n\nTracy Smith: But he went from a real estate millionaire to bussing tables?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: Right, I think he was just desperate to fit in and stay on the run. He was willing to do anything to sustain his flight.\n\nOne of the biggest investigative breaks that led the U.S. Marshals to Chadwick was their discovery that he was in communication with people who knew him.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: We learned sometime last year, through the investigation, that he was receiving help from those close to him. To what extent, I don't know. And how the quantities of money that were provided him, I don't know. We do know that he was getting assistance from those close to him back up here still.\n\nThat information, combined with the new tip and old-fashioned police work by Newport Beach Police, the U.S. Marshals, and Mexican authorities ultimately led to Chadwick's arrest.\n\nTracy Smith: The bizarre thing is that this took you know nearly five years to unfold and then boom! It happened overnight.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: That's entirely due to the relationship with had with the Mexican authorities. Their response to the intelligence that was gathered, their own intelligence gathering, that's really paid off.\n\nAt this point, authorities are not saying if they will charge anyone else in connection with Chadwick's escape.\n\nMeantime, they are savoring their victory. Chief Lewis says he always knew Chadwick's days were numbered.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you ever, for a moment, think, \"He's gone forever?\"\n\nChief Jon Lewis: Not -- not for a minute. I believe in our investigators. I believe in our process. I believe in the -- in the heart of this police department towards solving these cases. And, so, in my mind, it was just a matter of time before we got him. It wasn't gonna be an if. It was a when.\n\nTracy Smith: Did he seem at all relieved?\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: He did. At the end. \u2026 He said something along the lines of, \"It was getting hard keeping up with the lies.\"\n\nFor Karen Thorp, Q.C.'s close friend, Chadwick's capture brings mixed emotions.\n\nTracy Smith: What's it like to see that?\n\nKaren Thorp: I'm angry, repulsed. I want to make him know the pain that everybody else suffered.\n\nTracy Smith: One of the things we heard was that he was at a resort in Mexico. What do you think of that?\n\nKaren Thorp: Outrageous. \u2026 Somebody who could have done this to her and then live the high life is just a testament to his coldness and depravity.\n\nAnd that coldness, investigators say, extended to Chadwick's willingness to abandon his three sons forever.\n\nCHIEF JON LEWIS [to reporters]: Our investigation shows that Peter Chadwick never intended to return from Mexico. He had no intentions of coming back to Orange County to face trial or raise the three sons that he'd abandoned. Speaking of the boys, our hearts go out to them and we ask that everyone respect their privacy at this incredibly emotional time.\n\nWe don't know how the Chadwick boys have reacted to their father's capture, but we do know that in recent months Karen Thorp told \"48 Hours\" they've been doing well.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you have a sense of how the boys are doing?\n\nKaren Thorp: They're really, really strong, really, really supported by Q.C.'s family. There's so much love around them and so much love for them. They've really - they've continued to flourish in spite of this tragedy.\n\nQ.C. Chadwick\n\nAnd that is a fitting tribute to a dedicated mom whose life was cut so short.\n\nArt Scott | Music teacher: We lost in Q.C. a mother who cared for her children deeply, and who loved life and loved vibrancy, and loved to give her children all that she possibly could.\n\nPeter Chadwick has been denied bail.
