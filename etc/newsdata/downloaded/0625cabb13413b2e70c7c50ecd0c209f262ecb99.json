It's a custom job based on the ARM architecture.\n\nAll that to say the Surface Pro X should deliver great performance for most people at no cost to battery life. But I'm placing special emphasis on \"should,\" as we haven't run the Surface Pro X through its paces yet.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nMicrosoft announced quite a lineup of interesting devices this week \u2014 going by the numbers, the company introduced more brand-new devices than it did updates to existing ones.\n\nSome of the interesting stuff included the Surface Duo, an actual real-life Microsoft phone running Android on two screens, as well as a larger tablet version called the Surface Neo that runs a new operating system called Windows 10 X.\n\nBut that stuff's not going to be available for another year, so let's focus on something you'll be able to buy this November: The Surface Pro X.\n\nIn many ways, this new device is a Surface Pro lookalike, albeit significantly more sleek. But turning the wheels inside the Surface Pro X is a very special chip that Microsoft is using for the first time, and it gives the Surface Pro X more battery life than most other laptops.\n\nCheck out my initial impressions of the Surface Pro X:", "description": "The slim and light-weight Microsoft Surface Pro X boasts a 13-hour battery life with its special new ARM chip from Qualcomm", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d960d3d78c0cd1f0742a278?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
