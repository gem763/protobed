Most states only explicitly say that drunkenness implies a lack of consent if the intoxication was involuntary, according to a Brooklyn Law Review article published in 2016.\n\nAbout 10 states' definitions of mental incapacitation included voluntarily intoxication by the time the article was published.\n\nRead more\n\nThe law in New York relies on the fact that someone who was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of an alleged assault may not remember everything that happened, including whether they agreed to have sex, Mr Vance said.\n\nBut, he said, it may have been clear to the assailant that the victim lacked the mental capacity to consent.\n\nVance pointed to the case of Kenneth Moreno and Franklin Mata, then-New York City police officers whom in 2011 were acquitted of charges that they raped an intoxicated woman after helping her while on patrol.\n\nExisting law made it hard for prosecutors to prove the woman had not agreed to sex, Mr Vance said, but it should have been apparent to the officers that she could not consent.", "description": "The scenario is unfortunately common: A woman goes to a bar and chooses to have several drinks.
