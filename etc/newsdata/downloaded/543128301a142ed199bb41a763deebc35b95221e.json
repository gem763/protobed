On his best songs, like \u201cDevil In A New Dress,\u201d \u201cJesus Walks\u201d and \u201cFather Stretch My Hands,\u201d he paired a desire for self-betterment with the ugliest and basest parts of his psyche, making the angel and the devil on his shoulders work in concert.\n\nBut West has excised his darkness on JESUS IS KING, his latest album, which was released on Friday after several delays. With its declarative caps lock title, gospel music influences and almost exclusively religious material, West promises reinvention and reinvigoration in the wake of a troubled few years, in which he\u2019s fought opioid addiction, drawn blowback for comments about Donald Trump and slavery, and engaged in high-profile spats with former collaborators Drake and Jay-Z. Jesus Is King is his opportunity to turn the other cheek as a chastened and reformed preacher for the hip hop age.\n\nWhile the album\u2019s concept might be lofty, it\u2019s also his least ambitious. Jesus Is King clocks in at just 27 minutes\u2014slightly longer than the stump of an album that was Ye\u2014and feels heavy on shortcuts and light on tension. While there are plenty of likable elements\u2014impassioned melodies, slick production, motivated guest appearances\u2014the album is dominated by generic worship lyricism and overfamiliar sounds. By eschewing the paradoxes that have driven his best work, West has unwittingly put forward another one: he\u2019s claimed God as his greatest inspiration, but made the least inspired album of his career.\n\nThe album\u2019s weaknesses begin with West\u2019s single-minded lyricism. The topic at hand is nothing new for West, who has explored his faith in profound ways\u2014especially on the one-two punch of \u201cJesus Walks\u201d and \u201cNever Let Me Down\u201d on The College Dropout. On those songs, he paints vivid narratives about personal and societal struggle, reckoning with his own complicity as he seeks salvation.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

His lyrics mostly begin and end with variations on the same bland pledge: \u201cFollow Jesus, listen and obey\u201d; \u201cI bow down to the King upon the throne\u201d; \u201cThe army of God and we are the truth\u201d; \u201cHe\u2019s the strength in this race that I run.\u201d His songs were once unending strings of double-entendres and cunning turns of phrase. Here he rhymes \u201csafe\u201d with \u201csafe\u201d on \u201cWater,\u201d and can\u2019t be bothered to develop out a metaphor on \u201cFollow God\u201d: \u201cWrestlin\u2019 with God, I don\u2019t really want to wrestle.\u201d He also has a tendency of repeating lines that are even remotely interesting, just in case we didn\u2019t get them the first time: \u201cI ain\u2019t mean, I\u2019m just focused,\u201d he barks twice.\n\nWest\u2019s verbal mission is more limited here compared to past records. But in his attempt to avoid negativity, he fundamentally misunderstands gospel lyricism, which is often filled with conflict and hardship. Classics such as \u201cThere is a Balm in Gilead\u201d and \u201cTake My Hand, Precious Lord\u201d wallow in despair, while even a more upbeat hymn like \u201cHow I Got Over\u201d derives its strength from the narrator\u2019s lifetime of weariness. Many gospel songs are driven by transformation, in which sinners hit rock bottom before receiving a glimmer of hope.\n\nWest waves at this idea in \u201cHands On,\u201d the strongest song of the record. \u201cTold the devil that I\u2019m going on a strike / I\u2019ve been working for you my whole life,\u201d he says, and integrates his own struggle with police brutality and America\u2019s three-strikes law, which predominantly impacts communities of color. But instead of digging deeper, he raps about not being accepted by other Christians. Elsewhere, his pledges of devotion do little to convey why he has reinvented himself as a worship artist, or what\u2019s at stake on a greater communal scale. Because most of the songs on Jesus is King don\u2019t have conflict, they can\u2019t achieve satisfying catharsis.\n\nLyricism is only a fraction of gospel music, of course; on Aretha Franklin\u2019s hallowed live album Amazing Grace, some of the strongest moments unfold when she\u2019s barely singing words at all\u2013just repeating \u201cright on\u201d over and over, or howling pew-shaking vocal runs. Cascades of harmony, torrential grooves, or a simple mantra repeated over and over can sometimes convey faith even more strongly than complex storytelling.\n\nAnd there are certainly moments of musical vitality on Jesus Is King. West\u2019s melody on \u201cClosed On Sunday\u201d is one of his strongest in recent memory, while \u201cHands On\u201d benefits from frenetic autotuned sermonizing by Fred Hammond. For the second straight album in a row, Ant Clemons delivers a standout verse with his wispy falsetto\u2014first on Ye\u2019s \u201cAll Mine,\u201d now on the beatific \u201cWater.\u201d\n\nBut for the most part, Jesus Is King is even-keeled, sedate, and nothing we haven\u2019t heard from West before. The hammering piano and autotuned harmonies of \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d are swiped straight from the playbook of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, while the chopped up soul sample of \u201cFollow God\u201d sounds like a reject from Pusha T\u2019s \u201cDaytona.\u201d West is smart enough to use Pierre Bourne, one of the leading stylists in hip-hop\u2014but Bourne\u2019s beat \u201cOn God\u201d is unfocused and stale compared to his loopy, unpredictable collaborations with Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert.\n\nThese retreads are frustrating particularly because West\u2019s most impactful innovations have always been through sound. As a producer in the early \u201900s, he brought chipmunked soul samples to the fore; he revolutionized the autotune and digital timbres on 808s and Heartbreak; and on Yeezus, fused rap with an abrasive industrial brutalism, setting the template for the sound and attitude of the SoundCloud rap era. Each transgression alienated many at first, but gradually became part of the genre\u2019s lingua franca. West\u2019s sonic choices on Jesus Is King, in contrast, are recycled from his archives.\n\nWhile the best of West\u2019s records are intensely personal and self-aware, Jesus Is King has a glazed-over quality, as if being delivered through stained glasses, or from the Sunken Place, the fictional purgatory from Get Out that West fears the most. While he professes to be \u201cso radical\u201d on \u201cEverything We Need,\u201d Jesus is King is strictly functional. It\u2019s an album, ironically, weighed down by its lack of demons.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The gospel album is, ironically, weighed down by its lack of demons", "authors": ["Andrew R.
