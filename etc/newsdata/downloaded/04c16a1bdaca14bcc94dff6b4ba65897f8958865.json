He later told reporters at a constituent stop that he tried to get permission from Mr. Trump to tell Ukraine\u2019s president that American aid was on its way in the wake of those allegations, but Mr. Trump refused, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.\n\nYet a small minority of Republicans spoke out against Mr. Trump on Friday. Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah and a former presidential candidate, delivered the sharpest rebuke. The president\u2019s appeal to China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens was \u201cbrazen and unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Romney said, calling the conduct \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Will Hurd of Texas, a former C.I.A. officer and member of the Intelligence Committee who is retiring next year, also denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that China should investigate the Bidens. But in an interview on Friday with CNN, Mr. Hurd declined to make a definitive judgment about the text messages.\n\n\u201cI think some of these things are indeed damning,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I want to make sure we get through this entire investigation before coming to some kind of conclusion.\u201d\n\nNone of those reactions are in line with the one that Republican leaders have settled on for defending the president. They have argued that there was nothing improper about the president\u2019s suggestion that a foreign country should investigate one of his political rivals, and that no quid pro quo was suggested.\n\nRepresentative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, said in an interview on Thursday that \u201ca lot of people\u201d want to get to the bottom of the rumors about the Bidens and that Mr. Trump \u201cis echoing what people have been calling for, for a long time.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida suggested Mr. Trump was simply trying to provoke outrage from the news media, arguing of his public appeals to China and Ukraine, \u201cThat\u2019s not a real request.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s scattered responses underscore the challenge for Republican leaders of setting a message for a set of developments that are out of their control, said Antonia Ferrier, the former communications director for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.", "description": "Top Republicans have labored to find a unified message to push back against the rapidly expanding inquiry and break through a cascade of damaging information.", "authors": ["Catie Edmondson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/us/politics/03dc-repubs/03dc-repubs-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
