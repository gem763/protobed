He still lives resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he is still the head of the executive branch, and he's still the commander-in-chief of the world's most powerful military force.\n\nHe can still give orders and be reasonably sure that they will be followed, like the order he gave to a small group of US soldiers 12 days ago, requiring them to abandon the Syrian Kurdish allies with whom they'd shed blood on the way to defeating Isis. Those soldiers, loyal American servicemen, will follow those orders, even though doing so made them \u2014 in the words of one soldier \u2014 \u201cashamed for the first time in my career.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut ordering US servicemen to and fro seems to be the limit of Trump's power at the moment. Because the rest of the world has figured Donald Trump out.\n\nSuch was the degree of anger at Trump's sudden abandonment of America's Kurdish allies \u2014 seemingly for no other reason than to please Turkey's leader \u2014 that on Wednesday, all but 60 House Republicans joined Speaker Nancy Pelosi's caucus to approve a resolution condemning the move, 354-60. In the Senate, a bipartisan group of senators is readying legislation to impose crippling sanctions on the Turkish regime, with a veto-proof majority expected to join their House colleagues in expressing their disapproval of the Trump administration's enabling of Erdogan's ethnic cleansing.\n\nBut Trump seems to think he's doing great and that everything is fine.\n\nAfter the House dealt his Turkey policy a humiliating rebuke, Pelosi and the rest of the House and Senate leadership gathered at the White House for a briefing on the disastrous situation Trump had created. The president was so eager to boast of the \"tough\" stance he'd taken that he distributed a letter he'd sent to Erdogan \u2014 a letter which was so bizarre and childish in its wording that when it inevitably leaked to the media, journalists had to double-check to make sure it wasn't fake.\n\nAccording to Pelosi, he \"was not relating to the reality\" that a supermajority of House members disagreed with him, to the point where she walked out of the meeting, joined by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nSchumer explained how he'd reminded Trump of the dangerous conditions that could be created with the release of Isis fighters who'd been held by Kurdish forces, and noted that even retired Marine General James Mattis \u2014 Trump's former Secretary of Defense \u2014 had said that pulling out of Syria would enhance the terrorist group. According to a source who was in the meeting, Trump's response was to call Mattis \"the world's most overrated general\" and declare that he had personally \"captured Isis in a month.\"\n\nAnother source, who spoke to CNN's Jamie Gangel, said that Trump's demeanor left even Republicans \"completely shaken,\" \"shell-shocked\" and \"sickened.\"\n\n\"He is not in control of himself, it is all yelling and screaming,\" the source said, adding that Trump was \"100 per cent worse\" and that even Republicans are now worried about his stability.\n\nAs if to prove the anonymous source's point, Trump has spent the past two days claiming that he has brought peace to the region, rather than hand an unearned victory to Erdogan, Vladimir Putin, and Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\"Without spilling a drop of American blood\u2026 we've all agreed on a pause or ceasefire in the border region of Syria,\" the president said while speaking at a rally on Thursday, failing to mention that militias backed by Turkey have continued to fire on Kurdish forces during the five-day \u201cpause\".\n\nWhile congressional Republicans may be surprised to discover that Trump's present grip on reality seems tenuous at best, it's no surprise to Dr Bandy Lee, an assistant clinical professor at the Yale School of Medicine and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, which contains essays from 27 mental health professionals on the \"clear and present danger\" posed by The Donald\u2019s mental health (or lack thereof).\n\n\"It's gotten to the point where you don't have to be a doctor to see there's something seriously wrong here,\" Lee told me, adding that the decline into instability many are now observing in Trump was actually made inevitable by his ascent to the presidency. \"Such mental instability in a position of power would eventually get worse because of rising expectations after the taste of power with the constraints of reality catching up with them.\"\n\nLee explained that although she has not examined Trump personally, she and a group of mental health experts concluded that based on the reports of his conduct contained in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, Trump \"doesn't have the mental capacity to carry out his duties.\"\n\nLee and the other experts she's worked with joined more than 200 mental health professionals in signing a letter to members of Congress, in which they warned that \"the unfolding of an impeachment inquiry raises the specter of President Trump feeling threatened in ways he never has before.\"\n\n\"We also should not ignore the president\u2019s ability to initiate a conflict with other countries in order to distract from his political troubles, perhaps with the hope of rallying the country around him, as often happens at the beginning of armed conflict,\" they wrote in the letter, which is dated October 3, three days before Trump ordered US special forces to leave their Kurdish allies behind.\n\n\"What happened over the last week is the result of his irrational decision-making under increasing pressures,\" she said to me. \u201dHe will make decisions without heeding advice, he will not be able to take in facts, he will be impulsive in his decision-making, he will not be able to make sound reality-based decisions\u2026 That's all we've seen over the last week and a half.\"\n\nAlthough Trump's defenders argue that the analysis of Lee and her colleagues is invalid because none of them have examined or even met President Trump, Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has met him, and he sees things pretty much the same way.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general.

AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin.

However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year.

Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.
