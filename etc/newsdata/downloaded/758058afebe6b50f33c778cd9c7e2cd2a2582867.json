The prosecutor's office did not release her identity or further information.\n\nBrunel was a frequent companion of Epstein, who killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nFrench investigators searched the Paris offices of Brunel's agency, Karin Models, last month as part of a probe into possible Epstein victims in France.\n\nBrunel's lawyer said earlier this month that he contests accusations against him reported in the media, but that he's available to talk to judicial officials.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
