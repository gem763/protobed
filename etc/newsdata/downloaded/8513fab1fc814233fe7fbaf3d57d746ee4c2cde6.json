The plot follows a promotion-seeking Philadelphia police officer who begins a lifelong obsession with hunting a serial killer who returns every nine years. The investigation takes the officer down mysterious rabbit holes that defy logic.\n\nMichael C. Hall stars along with Cleopatra Coleman, Boyd Holbrook and Bokeem Woodbine.\n\n\u201cIn the Shadow of the Moon\u201d runs 1 hour, 55 minutes.\n\nRead on: In a review for Collider, Haleigh Foutch favorably compared the obsessions of the police officer protagonist, Locke, with the plot of David Fincher\u2019s 2007 movie \u201cZodiac.\u201d In a piece for io9, Germain Lussier also referred to \u201cZodiac,\u201d calling this movie a cross between the Fincher movie and \u201cThe Terminator.\u201d Here\u2019s Foutch\u2019s description:\n\nThe best hook is Locke\u2019s descent into \u201cZodiac\u201d-levels of obsessive investigation and the way his consistent choice to put work and his concept of justice before family leads to the death of his own happiness. His downward spiral bottoms out time after time, each new low a horrifying consequence of his own choices. It\u2019s not subtle, but it\u2019s effective.\n\nTrailer:", "description": "A sci-fi serial killer movie with Michael C.
