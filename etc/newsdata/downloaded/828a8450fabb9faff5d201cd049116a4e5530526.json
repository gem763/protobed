No, it\u2019s OK, they\u2019re supposed to be; they\u2019ve been told to, by me, with permission from their teacher. And they\u2019re not actually on the phone, because they don\u2019t know how to use it. It\u2019s an old-fashioned rotary telephone, finger-in-the-dial variety. They\u2019re tapping it, prodding at the holes. Hahahaha \u2013 they haven\u2019t got a clue.\n\nLoxford is an academy in Ilford, east London. I\u2019ve come here with a suitcase stuffed full of the past, tech from my own childhood, mostly borrowed from nostalgic hoarder colleagues. Everything in the case is obsolete: it\u2019s all been shrunk to fit into the smartphones today\u2019s 15-year-olds almost all have. It\u2019s a kind of social experiment, about different generations, lost skills, changing technology \u2013 what Loxford media studies teacher Mr Rushworth calls \u201cconvergence\u201d. OK, and it\u2019s also about having a laugh; and getting my generation\u2019s own back for those times we\u2019ve had to go crawling to a teenager for technical assistance, such as asking how to make the video on WhatsApp work.\n\nKids can\u2019t read maps. The minute they run out of power, or data and can\u2019t get to Google Maps, they are hopelessly lost\n\nMy first team of year 10 time travellers is Jannugan Sasiharan (plays games on his phone; watches YouTubers \u2013 he\u2019d rather not say which ones); Aissato Jalo (likes reading; family from Guinea-Bissau; speaks with an American accent, because she learned English by watching US TV shows such as Friends); and Rhianna Choudhury (prefect, head of year, probably should be running the country #VoteRhianna).\n\n1 Phone home\u2026 with a rotary dial telephone\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rhianna finds out that we have a technical problem. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\nAissato, Rhianna and Jannugan communicate with their friends on Snapchat and iMessage. They may actually talk, verbally, via WhatsApp and FaceTime, to their closest friends and parents. Rhianna FaceTimes family in Bangladesh.\n\nThey recognise the old phone from movies (and from watching The Sweeney in media studies \u2013 I want to go to Mr Rushworth\u2019s media studies classes). Do you have to call the operator first, wonders Jannugan? Is the operator even still there?\n\nOh, it\u2019s going to be hard to find out because we have a technical problem: Loxford is so modern there isn\u2019t a single old-fashioned BT phone socket in the building. We can\u2019t actually plug this phone in to surprise the operator with their first call in 20 years.\n\nWe\u2019ll just have to simulate. So what\u2019s the operator\u2019s number? Hey, you know what, you don\u2019t have to call the operator, you can just call your parents. So what\u2019s that number? \u201cYou have to actually dial the number instead of going to contacts,\u201d suggests Aissato.\n\nBut obviously they don\u2019t know their numbers, although Jannugan knows his mother\u2019s ends in 202. Hang on, he does know his landline number, amazingly, for emergencies, and there\u2019s always someone home. So let\u2019s dial it.\n\nThis is when the fun begins. Someone knows you have to turn the dial, but how far? They put their fingers in, then dial a teeny bit, then dial back, is that it? It\u2019s hopeless, none of them dials right round to the stopper, then releases before moving on to the next number. And they haven\u2019t taken the handset off the cradle, so they wouldn\u2019t be getting through anyway. Sad, worried parents, not to mention the lonely operator, would remain unrung.\n\nI\u2019m afraid, Almon Brown Strowger, that your design is an unintuitive disaster. And the kids are not impressed. How long, just to dial the number? And if it\u2019s busy, you have to go through the whole process again? On the plus side, you don\u2019t have to worry about running out of charge.\n\nEnjoyment: 3/10 Achievement: 4/10\n\n2 Get up\u2026 using a wind-up alarm clock\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aissato wonders what makes an old-fashioned alarm clock tick. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\nTraditionally this is not an easy task for a teenager. Jannugan\u2019s grandmother used to have one like this, he says, correctly identifying my next item, an alarm clock with bells on the top and a little hammer that jiggles between them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it needs batteries\u2026 or do you wind it up?\u201d Good work: soon there\u2019s a reassuring ticking from the clock.\n\nThey pass it round, winding (the alarm needs winding separately), twiddling, and eventually figure out that the third hand, the red one, must set the alarm. They don\u2019t find the little catch to release the hammer, that\u2019s just too stone age, but once I\u2019ve helped with that, they get it going: ding-a-ding-a-ding-ding\u2026 Jesus, remember? Like the hammer and the bells are inside your head.\n\n\u201cMy phone\u2019s much easier to use,\u201d Rhianna says.\n\n\u201cBut this wakes you up more, it\u2019s really loud,\u201d Jannugan says, possibly even a little impressed.\n\nEnjoyment: 5/10 Achievement: 7/10\n\n3 Tune in\u2026 to the wireless\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jannugan wonders if they still transmit programmes for radios. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\nSo now we\u2019re wide awake, let\u2019s turn the radio on. \u201cThat\u2019s a radio?\u201d Aissato says, about the little Sony model I\u2019ve brought along. They all say they don\u2019t really listen to the radio, sorry @gregjames. Rhianna\u2019s father sometimes has it on in the car, to know what\u2019s going on.\n\nThey do figure out how to pull the aerial up. \u201cAntenna,\u201d Jannugan says. To catch the signal or something, Rhianna says. From radio towers, Aissato says. Hey, between them they\u2019re practically Marconi.\n\nBut then there\u2019s a lot of twiddling and switching, crackle and hiss, some discussion about the meaning of FM/AM/LW/SW. (Frequency modulation and amplitude modulation; I\u2019d forgotten that.) Jannugan wonders if the towers still transmit, for radios like this. Yes! They still print newspapers, too, by the way.\n\nEventually, they stumble across Radio 5 Live, where the talk is about cricket. And then the knob for tuning falls off.\n\nEnjoyment: 6/10 Achievement: 6/10\n\n4 Look it up\u2026 in an encyclopedia\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aissato tries the analogue version of Google. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\nI set them a task \u2013 who won the Cricket World Cup? Easy, they say, England! No, in 1983. Ah. Ordinarily they would ask Google (they talk about Google, rather than anywhere Google might take them to). It would take two seconds. But there\u2019s no Google here; they\u2019re the search engines \u2013 go search.\n\n\u201cMaybe this has it,\u201d Aissato says, picking up a 1991 Pears\u2019 Cyclopaedia. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of an encyclopedia, but not a cyclopaedia,\u201d she says. Hmm, me, too, if I\u2019m honest. Here\u2019s a fun fact about Pears: they are the same people who make the soap, and the final edition, the 126th, was published in 2017.\n\nThey\u2019ve never seen an encyclopedia, but they get the hang of it, which is good news: books still work. They discover a contents page. Would it be in Events? Probably Sport. From there, it\u2019s a stroll: they figure out that it\u2019s arranged alphabetically, and have an answer in about three minutes. India won the World Cup in 1983.\n\nEnjoyment: 5/10 Achievement: 8/10\n\n5 Play time \u2026 with an old-school Nintendo Game Boy\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Game Boy is a big hit with Rhianna and Jannugan. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\n\u201cGame Boy!\u201d Rhianna says, excitedly, pointing at one of the objects on the table. Yes, it is: a Nintendo Game Boy handheld console, circa 1990. But how does a 15-year-old schoolgirl in east London in 2019 know that? From Stranger Things, she says. Really? I thought the Netflix sci-fi horror was set in the 80s, pre-Game Boy? Maybe also from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, she says.\n\nTurns out they\u2019ve also played with Game Boy emulators on their phones, but never a real one, so this is exciting. \u201cIt\u2019s original, pristine,\u201d Jannugan says.\n\nHe\u2019s not getting anywhere near it, though, because Rhianna has kidnapped the Game Boy. There are no problems operating it, Super Mario is loaded up and she\u2019s away: \u201cDo I have to grab the mushroom\u2026 oh I missed it \u2013 it gets you another life.\u201d\n\nI knew I\u2019d be obsessed with Game Boy. If my parents got me one they\u2019d never see me, it\u2019s so addictive. I want one\n\n\u201cAlso a good source of vitamin D,\u201d Mr Rushworth says, injecting some nutritional education into proceedings.\n\nRhianna\u2019s current favourite mobile game is a cooking simulation one called Cooking Fever. She likes Subway Surfers, too, as do Aissato and Jannugan. But there\u2019s a desirable authenticity about the old tech. \u201cI knew I\u2019d be obsessed with Game Boy,\u201d Rhianna says. \u201cIf my parents got me one they\u2019d never see me, it\u2019s so addictive. I want one.\u201d It\u2019s the only winner so far.\n\n\u201cSometimes the original is better,\u201d Rhianna admits, before loading Tetris without any problems (maybe ease of use is directly proportional to desirability). But it\u2019s clearly the exception to the rule. \u201cEverything here has been replaced by a smartphone,\u201d Aissato observes, of all my gear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quicker, more efficient, you can do all of these things on your phone,\u201d Rhianna says. \u201cIf I was to lose [my phone] I\u2019d be, like, so confused.\u201d\n\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Achievement: 10/10\n\nJannugan, Aissato and Rhianna have to go to an awards assembly now. I imagine they\u2019ll be collecting loads. Time for fresh legs. Six of them, with three fresh minds, belonging to Iqra Kadri (cheeky; says she should have worn mascara for the pictures), Najaat Shahbal (shier; likes science and maths), Tanu Pathak (laid-back; cool), and five new tasks.\n\n\n\n6 Spin class\u2026 with a turntable\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Najaat and Iqra play DJs. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt looks like one of those spinny things,\u201d Iqra says. It is one of those spinny things, also known as a record player. No, they\u2019re not CDs Tanu, they\u2019re records, seven-inch singles, some fairly desperate ones from my local charity shop (I wasn\u2019t going to risk anyone\u2019s precious vinyl on this lot). Iqra, Najaat and Tanu listen to music on apps and YouTube, via their phones, obviously. Pay for it? Eh? Why would anyone do that? The girls like masked UK rapper M Huncho; Tanu\u2019s more of a rock and pop man. Well, I have here Topanga by David Soul. Yeah, pretty much the M Huncho of his day.\n\nThey manage to put the disc on the turntable, Tanu moves the arm across, and puts it down on the rotating record \u2013 gently, Tanu! We have music, of sorts, even if it\u2019s halfway through the song.\n\n\u201cIt sounds scary, like a horror movie,\u201d Iqra says. She\u2019s not wrong, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s on 33rpm. We talk about what changing the speed does, and needles, and how many songs you might find on a record like this \u2013 only one on each side! Then I ask them to start from the beginning of the record.\n\nThis proves tricky. Tanu picks up the arm and puts it down in the middle of the song again. \u201cCan you rewind it?\u201d Najaat asks. Good question: no.\n\nWe watch and listen for a while, the needle riding the groove, David Soul\u2019s spooky howling (it really is a terrible record at any speed) echoing across the classroom. Eventually, Iqra realises that the needle is moving, slowly, towards the centre of the record. So where\u2019s the beginning? The edge! She picks it up, and puts the needle down on the edge, the beginning. Yay!\n\nThey don\u2019t have much good to say about the turntable \u2013 too complicated, easily broken, bad sound quality.\n\nBut then they seem to remember that record players aren\u2019t just about lounging about listening to rubbish songs, they belong in other places. Suddenly Iqra and Najaat are pretending to be DJs \u2013 the club sort, sorry @gregjames \u2013 spinning and scratching (has David Soul ever been scratched before?). The spinny thing reclaims its credibility.\n\nEnjoyment: 7/10 Achievement: 6/10\n\n7 Play it again\u2026 with a Sony Walkman\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tanu and Najaat are unimpressed by the Sony Walkman. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\nMistake number one: the teenagers fail to take the tape out of its case before trying to get it in the player. I couldn\u2019t find an actual Walkman, but this Sony cassette player is as near as dammit. They find and open the door, eventually get the tape the right way round; this one does have rewind, which I nudge them in the direction of, then play.\n\nThere\u2019s a really positive reaction in the room. Not from Iqra, Najaat or Tanu, sadly, but from Mr Rushworth. Turns out 7800\u00b0 Fahrenheit by Bon Jovi is one of Mr Rushworth\u2019s all-time favourite records. He used to listen to it on the way to training\u2026 yeah, all right, this isn\u2019t about you, sir.\n\nFor the kids it\u2019s the usual issues: too complicated, too big, too rubbish; why would you pay for it? I show them how to wind a tape back in, using a pencil, not that they\u2019ll ever need to do that.\n\nEnjoyment: 5/10 (Mr Rushworth: 10/10) Achievement: 4/10\n\n8 Snap it\u2026 on a 35mm camera\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Where\u2019s the screen?\u2019: Najaat doesn\u2019t click with the 35mm camera. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the screen? Normally there\u2019s a screen,\u201d Iqra says, looking at the back of the camera. \u201cOh, you peek through that, innit,\u201d Tanu says, looking through the viewfinder, then pushing the button. All correct, but there\u2019s no film.\n\nThey open the door, but loading a film proves too hard. Sophia, the Guardian\u2019s photographer, shows us how to pull out the film this much, push the roll in, then shut the door. We hear the whirr as it winds itself on. I remember pretending my camera was an electric razor during that bit \u2013 actually, probably during the rewind when the whirr was longer. Oh it was a laugh, back in the day.\n\nIqra, Najaat and Tanu are soon snapping away: each other, selfies, zooming in and out, photographing the actual photographer.\n\nNormally they take photos on their phones \u2013 family, friends \u2013 then share them. The idea of waiting to get your photos developed is quite alien to them. \u201cDid you have to pay for it?\u201d Najaat asks. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t check it? Imagine if you print it out and it\u2019s ugly.\u201d\n\nEnjoyment: 7/10 Achievement: 7/10\n\n9 Write home\u2026 using pen and paper\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iqra puts pen to paper. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\nHere\u2019s some paper, Basildon Bond, blue, found at the bottom of a drawer. Now write a letter!\n\n\u201cFoundation pens,\u201d Najaat says. Near enough.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Iqra says. That\u2019s because it needs this: ink (also blue, I seem to remember that it was easier to get out of clothes than black). \u201cDidn\u2019t they dip in feathers,\u201d Tanu says. Don\u2019t be cheeky, how old do you think I am?\n\nThey start by just dipping their pens into the ink pot, and that seems to work OK. They\u2019re not cartridge pens, but rather the ones with the little rubber reservoir you squeeze to suck up the ink. It soon gets very inky. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called fountain pens not foundation pens, Najaat. Snapchat\u2019s much less messy. We stick to dipping.\n\nDear Mother, begins Iqra. Is that what she calls her? \u201cNo, I just wrote it. I call her Mummy.\u201d Nice neat writing, though; less so, Tanu.\n\nAnd so, for the first time ever, they write letters home, about what a brilliant morning they\u2019re having at school (I imagine). Actually, they write half-letters, because we\u2019re running out of time and we need to send them. I have envelopes, to be addressed, which Iqra does quite eccentrically: parents\u2019 names top left, then address top right, postcode first, then Ilford, then street. Will it ever get there? They\u2019ll have to post them first\u2026\n\nEnjoyment: 3/10 Achievement: 5/10\n\n10 Find it\u2026 on the map!\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iqra, Tanu and Najaat are lost without their phones. Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian\n\nKids these days, they can\u2019t read maps. The minute they run out of power, or data and can\u2019t get to Google Maps or Waze, they are hopelessly lost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a book,\u201d Tanu says. \u201cA guide, a map of the whole of London, basically.\u201d\n\nYes and it\u2019s called the A-Z. Now find the school. After flicking through, marvelling at how long it must have taken to make, they find the index, and Loxford Lane, IG1. Good start. The index directs them to \u201c5G, 71\u201d. So they turn to page 5, where there seems to be a column called G, and here\u2019s a boating lake, which must be the boating lake up the road, yay! Except the boating lake on the map is in Regent\u2019s Park. A fail, then. Back to the index: 71 is the page, 5 and G the column and row, Ilford, this looks promising, where\u2019s the school then? What do you think \u201csch\u201d might stand for? I\u2019m sure they would have found it, eventually, but we\u2019d have been there all day.\n\nWe have been granted special permission to leave the premises \u2013 no, not to get takeaway, Iqra \u2013 but to buy stamps. And I\u2019ve heard they can be bought on Gordon Road near the junction with Henley Road. It doesn\u2019t go brilliantly. Where are we now? \u201cIt\u2019s just an alleyway,\u201d Iqra says. Well this looks like a road? After looking at the map, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s just called \u2018Road\u2019.\u201d That\u2019s because the first part of the name is up the other end: Gordon Road! We pass Staines Road, Eton Road, Mortlake Road, and find it, the post office. Not because they have map-read their way here, but because they knew where we were going.\n\nStill, they successfully purchase stamps for the first time, which involves interaction with another human being.\n\nNow to post them: where\u2019s the post box? Just there, Iqra says. No, that one\u2019s broken, there\u2019s a better one on Woodlands Road. Najaat looks at her phone, she\u2019s only got 10%. Oi, put it away. \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re in the 80s,\u201d she remembers. Back on page 71, Najaat finds Woodlands Road and we set off, she and Iqra recommending M Huncho tracks to me as we walk. In the right direction, as it happens, and this time I think they are actually using the A-Z. There may even be a happy ending to this story: some time in the next couple of days, on to the doormats of three surprised sets of parents in east London, three letters may drop. Half-finished, messy, splodgy\u2026 but actual hand-written letters home. Just like in the olden days.\n\nEnjoyment: 5/10 Achievement: 5/10.\n\n\u2022 With thanks to Loxford school and the Guardian\u2019s Education Centre\n\nIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).\n\nComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.
