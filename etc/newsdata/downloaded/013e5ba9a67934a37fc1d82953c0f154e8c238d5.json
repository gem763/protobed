Though it would appear to be theoretically feasible, from a practical standpoint, it is considered to be a hypothetical, unconventional monetary policy tool whose implementation is highly improbable.\n\nKey Takeaways Helicopter drop, a term coined by Milton Friedman, refers to a last resort type of monetary stimulus strategy to spur inflation and economic output.\n\nHelicopter drop is an expansionary fiscal policy that is financed by an increase in an economy's money supply.\n\nMostly, the term 'helicopter drop' is largely a metaphor for unconventional measures to jump start the economy during deflationary periods.\n\n0:53 Helicopter Money: Word on the Street\n\nUnderstanding Helicopter Drop (Helicopter Money)\n\nHelicopter drop is an expansionary fiscal policy that is financed by an increase in a economy's money supply. It could be an increase in spending or a tax cut, but it involves printing large sums of money and distributing it to the public in order to stimulate the economy. Mostly, the term 'helicopter drop' is largely a metaphor for unconventional measures to jump start the economy during deflationary periods.\n\nWhile 'helicopter drop' was first mentioned by noted economist Milton Friedman, it gained popularity after Ben Bernanke made a passing reference to it in a November 2002 speech, when he was a new Federal Reserve governor. That single reference earned Bernanke the sobriquet of 'Helicopter Ben', a nickname that stayed with him during much of his tenure as a Fed member and Fed chairman.\n\nBernanke\u2019s reference to 'helicopter drop' occurred in a speech that he made to the National Economists Club, about measures that could be used to combat deflation. In that speech, Bernanke defined deflation as a side effect of a collapse in aggregate demand, or such a severe curtailment in consumer spending that producers would have to cut prices on an ongoing basis to find buyers. He also said the effectiveness of anti-deflation policy could be enhanced by cooperation between monetary and fiscal authorities, and referred to a broad-based tax cut as \u201cessentially equivalent to Milton Friedman\u2019s famous \u2018helicopter drop\u2019 of money.\u201d\n\nEven though Bernanke\u2019s critics subsequently used this reference to disparage his economic policies, they were effectively silenced by his adroit handling of the U.S. economy during and after the Great Recession of 2008-09. Faced with the biggest recession since the 1930s, and with the U.S. economy on the brink of catastrophe, Bernanke used some of the very same methods outlined in his 2002 speech to combat the slowdown, such as expanding the scale and scope of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases.\n\nJapan Considers a Helicopter Drop", "description": "Helicopter drop, a term coined by Milton Friedman, refers to a last resort type of monetary stimulus strategy to spur inflation and economic output.", "authors": ["Akhilesh Ganti"], "top_image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/j7VMgImrnOwgK-iWqPvUG9Tl_OM=/680x440/filters:fill(auto,1)/shutterstock_406718734-5bfc2b5246e0fb002601629c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-29"}
