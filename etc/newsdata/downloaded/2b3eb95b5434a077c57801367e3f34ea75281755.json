They had not been planning to attend the game, assuming Michael Keane or Joe Gomez would get the nod ahead of him.\n\nAt half-time, they had not heard the monkey chanting aimed at Mings but had proudly witnessed him make a confident start to his England career.", "description": "Tyrone Mings will be remembered as one of the men who reported the racists on his big night in Sofia, but his on-pitch performance on his England debut should not be forgotten.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Sam Wallace", "Keith Hackett", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000213031271-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
