She talks about her two Grammy nominations while Bravo's Andy Cohen sings a few -- just a few -- bars from her hit 'So What.' (Dec. 10) AP\n\nPink just got the sweetest homecoming gift ever, courtesy of her 2-year-old son.\n\nThe 40-year-old singer, who is in the midst of her Beautiful Trauma World Tour, took a break from prepping her next performance to share her son's reaction to her arrival home.\n\nIn a black-and-white video posted to Instagram, son Jameson Moon, clad in a Spider-Man T-shirt, greeted his mommy with hugs and a special surprise.\n\n\"Momma, I got you flowers,\" he said, holding up a bouquet.\n\nThe tot also turned to the person filming, presumably Pink's husband, Carey Hart, to add \"I got you flowers, too!\"\n\nPink clearly loved her son's sweet surprise.\n\n\"They're beautiful, buddy, thank you,\" she said, kissing him on the head. \"I missed you so much.\"\n\nPink captioned the video, \"Happy homecoming. Spider-Man and flowers.\"\n\nPink vs. mom-shamers: Here are the singer's most epic takedowns of the parent police\n\nMore: Byeee! Pink disables Instagram comments after too many parenting police slams\n\nSince welcoming her daughter Willow Sage, 8, and Jameson Moon, the \"Perfect\" artist has confronted her fair share of trolls coming after her for the way she raises her kids.\n\nWhether it's attacking her for taking her children to the zoo or shaming her for (gasp!) having a family dinner night, haters have consistently tried to tear down the Grammy winner. Eventually, Pink got so tired of it, she disabled her Instagram comments with a flurry of middle-finger emojis. She still won't allow them on some pictures that feature her kids.\n\nMore: Celebrity moms get mom-shamed too.
