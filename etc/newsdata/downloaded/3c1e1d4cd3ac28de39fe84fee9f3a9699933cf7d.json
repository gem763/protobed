Every year, about 300,000 anchor babies are born in the country and as of June, there has been an average of about 124,000 anchor babies born this year.\n\nThe sanctuary state of California is home to at least 1.2 million anchor babies under the age of 18, as Breitbart News reported. This is roughly twice the total population of Wyoming. The total of anchor babies under the age of 18 in ten U.S. states is more than four times the population of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nIn total, there are now an unprecedented 62 million immigrants and their U.S.-born children living across the country, as Breitbart News has previously reported. As of 2017, there were 17.1 million U.S.-born minor children of immigrants in the country.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
