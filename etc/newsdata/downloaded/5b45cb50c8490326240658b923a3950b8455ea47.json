So it\u2019s weighted for that.\u201d\n\nThe Fox News personality went on to say that the poll was taken at a time when there\u2019s a \u201cfever pitch of media coverage about a single topic,\u201d suggested that such results are to be expected.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got all the Democrats, plus or minus 3 percent, saying they want him out,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s not a big finding. That\u2019s not a surprise. In a month or so when all this stuff fades, let\u2019s see where it is now.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Fox News poll, 51 percent of registered voters would like to see Trump impeached and removed. While it found 85 percent of Democrats want the president out, it also shows 13 percent of Republicans would like Trump removed and 39 percent of independents.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind ourselves how many Democrats and how many Republicans are in this poll and these polls have been known to be wrong,\u201d Gutfeld continued. \u201cSorry for bringing it up. But if you\u2019re going to put it on the table at The Five we get to respond.\u201d\n\nWilliams, meanwhile, noted that more people self-identify as Democrats than Republicans in the country and that\u2019s why the poll is weighted that way. This prompted conservative co-host Katie Pavlich to say that they don\u2019t live in the states needed to win the electoral college, suggesting they are mostly in California and New York.\n\nThe poll, however, showed that in swing counties where Trump and Hillary Clinton were within 10 points of each other in 2016, support for impeachment increased to 52 percent.\n\nGutfeld\u2019s criticism of his own network\u2019s poll comes as other Fox News on-air personalities have attempted to spin the results as either not significant or a positive for Trump. While some have suggested \u201cmisinformation\u201d is skewing the polls, others have expressed doubt about the findings.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing this poll everywhere and I know it\u2019s a Fox News poll but we got to point out that it\u2019s weighted toward Democrats,\u201d Greg Gutfeld said.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570745433/five_48_ldq4gl", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
