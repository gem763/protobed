But you can also pick up a rhinovirus infection on your hands from \u00addoorknobs or handrails and trolleys.\n\nSome of these viruses can survive on your hands for up to an hour, so try to wash your hands regularly.\n\nAnd do a thorough job. Don\u2019t just run your hands under water.\n\nThe World Health Organisation recommends 20 seconds using soap \u2013 roughly the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.\n\nSo go for it (in your head \u00adpreferably to avoid strange looks) as you clean palms, backs of hands, in between fingers and thumbs and under the nails. Dry with a paper towel, then use it to turn off the tap.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nDon\u2019t touch your face\n\nCan\u2019t get to a basin to wash your hands? Then avoid touching your face until you can. Cold viruses enter your body through your mouth, eyes or nose.\n\nIf you\u2019re prone to nail-biting, use a special bitter-tasting polish to help discourage you from the habit.\n\nWash it hot\n\nAs well as surviving on hard surfaces, cold and flu viruses linger on fabrics, too.\n\nIf someone in your house has the sniffles, microbiologists suggest skipping the eco-friendly option on your washing machine when doing their clothes, bedding and towels, as the wash temperature won\u2019t be high enough.\n\nInstead, go for 60 degrees. Use a hot cycle in your dryer if you can, to kill off microbes.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nTake echinacea\n\nThe herb has been shown to prevent cold symptoms erupting, says immunologist Dr Ross Walton.\n\nIn 2012, 755 participants took part in the longest and largest trial by the Common Cold Centre in Cardiff on the preventative use of echinacea over a four-month period.\n\nDr Walton says: \u201cThe development of recurrent colds reduced by 59%, as well as symptom severity.\u201d\n\nHe adds that herbal \u00admedicines that contain all parts of the plant \u2013 such as A.Vogel Echinaforce (\u00a34.99; avogel.co.uk ), work best.\n\nGo incognito\n\nCover your face and nose with a scarf in cold weather .\n\nA Yale University study found the virus flourishes better in the naturally cooler environment of your nasal passages than at a warmer core body \u00adtemperature because the immune response doesn\u2019t work as well in the cold.\n\nSo keeping nasal passages warm could mean the virus won\u2019t replicate as easily.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nGargle with sea salt water\n\nPeople with the first symptoms of a cold who washed out mucus from the nose and gargled with cooled, boiled salt water reduced their cold virus \u00adsymptoms by two days, Edinburgh researchers found.\n\nThey were less likely to need medicines. It\u2019s thought sea salt may boost the body\u2019s \u00adantiviral defences.\n\nKeep your feet warm too\n\nResearch has found if our feet become chilly, blood vessels in our noses constrict.\n\nLess blood flow to the nose means fewer cold-fighting white cells will reach it, so any dormant infection is more likely to take hold.\n\nWear socks with at least 60% wool to keep toes toasty.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Picture Press RM)\n\nExercise\n\nA study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found people who exercised regularly cut cold risks by half.\n\nTry to achieve at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) every week.\n\nBe an office clean freak\n\nAlmost half of desks, computer mice and office phones harbour the cold virus, according to research.\n\nDesk sharing can expose you to five times more germs than if you have your own. Pack eco-friendly tissues in your work bag to wipe down your workstation.\n\nStop stressing\n\nAn experiment that saw people given the cold virus nasally revealed the most stressed were more likely to succumb than those who were relaxed.\n\nResearchers concluded that under stress immune system cells produce levels of inflammation that lead to disease. If you are stressed, try yoga or meditation.\n\n(Image: E+)\n\nDon\u2019t be d-ficient\n\nVitamin D supplements can help cut the risk of colds in people who have a deficiency.\n\nPublic Health England suggests we take a daily supplement in autumn and winter to protect muscles and bones anyway.\n\nBe more sociable\n\nSitting home alone might seem like the best way to avoid catching a cold.\n\nBut university researchers based in Pennsylvania found that people who were more sociable had better immunity due to mixing with others.", "description": "When the sniffles strike, you just have to sit it out with plenty of fluids and painkillers - so here are some tactics to keep the infections at bay", "authors": ["Kim Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images Picture Press Rm", "E"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532604.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Young-woman-blowing-nose-wearing-bathrobe-close-up.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
