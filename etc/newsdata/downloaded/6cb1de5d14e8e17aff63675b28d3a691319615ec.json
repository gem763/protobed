But the statement gave no further details like exactly what projectile North Korea fired.\n\nOn Monday night, the North\u2019s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, said North Korea is willing to resume nuclear diplomacy with the United States in late September but that Washington must come to the negotiating table with acceptable new proposals. She said if the proposals don\u2019t satisfy North Korea, dealings between the two countries may come to an end.\n\nChoe\u2019s statement and the following projectile launches were apparently aimed at pressuring the United States to make concessions when the North Korea-U.S. talks restart. North Korea is widely believed to want the United States to provide it with security guarantees and extensive relief from U.S.-led sanctions in return for limited denuclearization steps.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump called North Korea\u2019s announcement \u201cinteresting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn the meantime, we have our hostages back, we\u2019re getting the remains of our great heroes back and we\u2019ve had no nuclear testing for a long time.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the White House following reports of the launches.\n\nIn the late-night statement carried by state media, Choe said North Korea is willing to sit down with the United States \u201cfor comprehensive discussions in late September of the issues we have so far taken up, at a time and place to be agreed.\u201d\n\nChoe said she hopes the United States will bring \u201ca proposal geared to the interests of the DPRK and the U.S. and based on decision methods acceptable to us.\u201d DPRK stands for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the North\u2019s official name.\n\nShe warned that \u201cif the U.S. side fingers again the worn-out scenario which has nothing to do with new decision methods at the DPRK-U.S. working negotiation to be held with so much effort, the DPRK-U.S. dealings may come to an end.\u201d\n\nTalks on North Korea\u2019s nuclear disarmament fell apart in February when Trump rejected North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s demand for sweeping sanctions relief in return for partial disarmament at their second summit in Vietnam.\n\nIt was a huge embarrassment for the young North Korean leader, who made a dayslong train trip to the Vietnamese capital to obtain the sanctions relief he needs to revitalize his country\u2019s troubled economy.\n\nIn April, Kim said he was open to another summit with Trump but set the end of the year as a deadline for the U.S. to offer improved terms for an agreement to revive the nuclear diplomacy.\n\nKim and Trump met again at the Korean border in late June and agreed to restart diplomacy, but there have no public meetings between the sides since then.\n\nIn recent months, North Korea has carried out a slew of missile and rocket tests to protest joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea that North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal. Some experts said the North Korean weapons tests were also a demonstration of its expanding weapons arsenal aimed at boosting its leverage ahead of new talks with the United States.\n\nMost of the North Korean weapons tested in July and August have been short range. This suggests that North Korea hasn\u2019t wanted to lift its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, which would certainly derail negotiations with Washington.\n\nTrump has downplayed the latest North Korean weapons tests, saying the U.S. never restricted short-range tests.", "description": "North Korea launched two unidentified projectiles into the sea on Tuesday, South Korea\u2019s military said, hours after the North offered to resume nuclear...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GH048_nkorea_ZG_20180409200054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
