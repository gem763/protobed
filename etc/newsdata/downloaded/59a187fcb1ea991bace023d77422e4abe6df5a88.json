He has lived the nightmare of being jailed in an eastern European country for a crime he did not commit. A decade on from being granted a Royal Pardon, the 33-year-old is pausing to reflect on the events that changed his life.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are weeks and months when I don\u2019t think about what happened and then something will come on the television about prison. I\u2019ll say to my wife, \u2018It\u2019s not like that.\u2019 She\u2019ll say. \u2018How would you know..? Oh.\u2019\u201d\n\nShields was on his way back from Istanbul, where he had watched Liverpool win the Champions League in remarkable circumstances, coming back from 3-0 down at half time to beat AC Milan on penalties. The journey home in May 2005 went through Golden Sands, a Black Sea resort in Bulgaria. Many Liverpool fans took tortuous routes to the final. Some of those staying at Golden Sands became involved in a drunken brawl outside a cafe and Martin Georgiev, a barman, was beaten up, hit on the head with a stone and seriously injured. Four men were arrested. Shields was dragged from his bed by police, told how to dress and taken into custody.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI was so naive,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I could think was, \u2018Let\u2019s get this over quickly.\u2019 When you\u2019re young you\u2019re a bit unaware about what\u2019s happening. I look back and think how stupid that when a policeman woke me up and told me to put on a certain kind of shirt I just did it. I was a teenager.\u201d\n\nConfused, isolated but compliant, Shields was taken to a police station. He was later convicted of attempted murder on the basis of eye-witness evidence. Bulgarian police procedures left a lot to be desired, though.\n\n\u201cThe ID parades were bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cI was sitting in the reception at the station handcuffed to a pipe with all the witnesses walking past looking at me. Then they were asked to pick me out in a lineup. There was no lawyer, just 18-year-old me thinking, \u2018Let\u2019s get this finished so I can get out.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt would be four years before he was free again. Georgiev was in a coma but when the barman woke, he too said that Shields was his attacker. \u201cI had mixed feelings when the victim pointed me out,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see the scar on his head and it looked horrific. Then he pointed a finger at me and I couldn\u2019t believe it. He sat by me in the court and I was trying to get his attention and say, \u2018You know you\u2019re lying.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn reflection, Shields understands why Georgiev believed he was looking at his attacker. \u201cWhen he woke up in hospital my face was all over the papers,\u201d the Scouser said. \u201cThe police told him it was me. People had identified me. I was angry at him at the time. That\u2019s sad because he was the biggest victim of all.\u201d\n\nOne of the men arrested with Shields, Graham Sankey, had been released without charge \u2013 the other two were convicted but given non-custodial sentences. Sankey returned to Liverpool where he confessed to being the perpetrator. He later recanted and refused to return to Bulgaria, give evidence from Britain or cooperate with Merseyside Police.\n\n\u201cMy uncle was sitting behind me in court and he said, \u2018Sankey\u2019s confessed.\u2019 I was certain I was getting acquitted,\u201d Shields said. \u201cI was stunned when the verdict went against me. The lieutenant at prison was good and allowed me a three-hour visit with the family. I needed that to process what happened. It was a godsend. I said, \u2018How can we fight this?\u2019\u201d\n\nShields was given a 15-year sentence. While his advocates back home galvanised for a campaign to highlight the flaws in the case, he began to adjust to life in the Bulgarian prison system. \u201cThe detention centre was archaic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no windows and conditions were bad. It was like Midnight Express. My dad kicked up a fuss. My skin was yellow. Prison was better but the worst thing was moving jails, going into the unknown. Any prisoner will tell you that.\n\n\u201cFor the first few years I wasn\u2019t angry. It was more, \u201cShit, how has this happened?\u201d\n\nSupport on Merseyside was strong. Local politicians got behind the campaign and there were two mosaics on the Kop highlighting Shields\u2019 plight. The FA reprimanded Liverpool but decided against sanctioning the club for flouting Fifa rules on political protest. Meanwhile, two appeals failed in the Bulgarian courts, although the second reduced the sentence to 10 years.\n\n\u201cI got letters detailing the support back home but I was on the flip side,\u201d he said \u201cIn Bulgaria I was the villain. When I learnt enough of the language to read the newspapers I\u2019d see myself described as a monster and hooligan.\u201d\n\nThe low point came when a further appeal to the European Court for Human Rights was rebuffed in 2007. \u201cEach appeal was blow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt grinds you down. That\u2019s why I gave up. Apathy took over.\u201d\n\nFor the family it was anything but apathy. By now Shields had been transferred back to the UK to complete his sentence. It was a very different environment. \u201cAll rules and regulations,\u201d he said. In 2008 the Bulgarian government confirmed that Britain had the right to pardon the prisoner but Jack Straw refused, saying it was beyond his authority but a judicial review disagreed. The Home Secretary became the focus of the campaign.\n\n\u201cThe family turned the spotlight back on Straw,\u201d Shields said. \u201cWhen the judicial review came back in my favour, he said there was no new evidence. In reality he hadn\u2019t looked at the original evidence.\u201d\n\nOn Merseyside people know how to put pressure on elected officials. The long battle for justice over Hillsborough showed it was possible to fight back even against seemingly insurmountable odds. \u201cIt\u2019s a city where we don\u2019t do campaigns quietly,\u201d Shields said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get anywhere knocking on doors, you have to kick them down. Dad threatened to stand for election against Straw in Blackburn. It got people\u2019s attention. It was a circus he didn\u2019t need.\u201d\n\nThe breakthrough came when one of Shields\u2019 siblings doorstepped the Labour MP. \u201cHe met my sister outside his office and tried to shake her hand but she refused,\u201d Shields said. The rebuffed worked. \u201cSo he got her to come inside and she explained what had happened.\u201d\n\nOn September 9 2009 Shields was pardoned, becoming the first Briton to be exonerated after being convicted abroad. The news came as a shock. \u201cIt came out of the blue,\u201d he said. \u201cI had two hours notice. Then I was out.\u201d\n\nFreedom brought its own demands. \u201cI was still 18 in my head,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone had moved on apart from me. I got a job by November. I needed it. In prison there\u2019s structure and suddenly there wasn\u2019t any. Even now I need regimentation.\n\n\u201cI was moving at 100mph for about a year. I couldn\u2019t sit down and watch the telly. I couldn\u2019t settle. My parents wanted me to go and talk to a therapist about the experiences but I was a bit pig-headed.\u201d\n\nThe attention was onerous, too. \u201cI hated the fact that when I came out people wanted to speak to me about the experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to get away from it. I thanked everyone for their help but didn\u2019t want to go over it. No one had bad intentions but I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I just wanted to blend into the background. When it became yesterday\u2019s news I was glad.\n\n\u201cI went to speak about miscarriages of justices in Leeds but it was all too much. Afterwards I said, \u2018I can\u2019t do this. Never again.\u2019 Why would you want to relive it every day? I know I should have been helping people but I couldn\u2019t handle it. It threw me into depression. It\u2019s selfish but it was the only way to cope.\u201d\n\nSlowly but surely he has rebuilt his life. \u201cI\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he said. He has married and has two children \u2013 a four-year-old and one-year-old \u2013 and wonders how, when the time comes, he will explain his experiences. \u201cWhen they\u2019re old enough to know I\u2019ll tell them,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to be bogged down by it.\n\n\u201cI remember looking at fellas in prison who were the same age as my dad. I couldn\u2019t imagine my dad in jail. I wonder will my kids think the same?\u201d\n\nHe still thinks about Georgiev, the other person whose life changed that night in May 14 years ago. \u201cHe was the victim,\u201d Shields reiterates. \u201cWe paid \u00a380,000 in fines. The family were constantly raising money. I wonder how much of it he saw? And how it affected his life?\n\n\u201cBulgaria was a very money-driven place. Everything in prison was about cash. Their society is built on that. I hope the cash didn\u2019t put a target on his back.\u201d\n\nMemories, like his grasp of the language, are beginning to fade but some friendships remain. A Bulgarian fellow former inmate still visits Liverpool. He rarely thinks about the other actor in the drama, Sankey, and is genuinely surprised when asked what he would say to the man who confessed to the crime, refused to give evidence and then denied his involvement. \u201cWhat would I do if I saw him?\u201d He ponders the thought. \u201cI\u2019d try to put a positive spin on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d thank him. My life is great now. It took this path and it\u2019s worked out well. You don\u2019t want to be angry. There\u2019s no point being angry.\u201d\n\nA decade on from his release, Michael Shields could not be happier. Or freer.
