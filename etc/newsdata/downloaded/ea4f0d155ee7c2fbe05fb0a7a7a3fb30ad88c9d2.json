Serena Williams, one of the most recognizable names and faces in the sport, has a net worth of about $180 million.\n\nThis year's U.S. Open has the richest prize pool in the sport's history with a total of over $57 million in prize money - up 8 percent from last year's event, the U.S. Tennis Association announced back in July.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Novak Djokovic lost his cool with a fan while warming up during the third round of the U.S. Open on Friday evening, warning the man he would \"come find him\" after the two exchanged words.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/Novak-Djokovic-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
