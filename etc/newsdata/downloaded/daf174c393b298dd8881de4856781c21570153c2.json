Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nThe name \"Brett Favre\" instantly stirs up numerous memories for fans of the Green Bay Packers, and as the Gunslinger turns 50 on Thursday, it's as good a time as any to look back on a bunch of them.\n\nThese are 50 memorable Brett Favre moments, kept mostly to his tenure during the Packers (with at least one memorable exception) and mostly in the vein of positive moments for Packers fans (so, no, there's no mention of his struggles with addiction, the voicemails he left for Jenn Sterger or his six-interception game against the St. Louis Rams in the playoffs ... trust us, there were plenty of interceptions to cover).\n\n50. The Strahan sack controversy\n\nNew York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan (92) sacks Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre during the fourth quarter Sunday, Jan. 6, 2002, at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.

But Brett Favre rolled out late in the game, seemingly right into the path of Strahan, then crumpled to the ground as Strahan fell on top of him to clinch the record at 22.5 sacks. Perhaps it was a well-intended flash of respect for Strahan, but it\u2019s a highlight that\u2019s been replayed a ton and served to discredit the record, with many believing Favre surrendered himself as a means of securing the record for Strahan.\n\n49.

The 31-year-old Cincinnati native didn\u2019t get off the field without taking a hit and was arrested, but the play came at a key moment, with the Packers trailing 21-14, inside Cincinnati territory with under a minute to go. Favre was sacked a couple of plays later and the Bengals held on.\n\n48.

(Photo: Tom Lynn, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nNov. 21, 2004\n\nThe Packers appeared to be in deep trouble, down 13-3 in the final seconds of the third quarter at Reliant Stadium in Houston. But back came the Packers, starting with a 24-yard touchdown pass from Favre to Donald Driver. Ryan Longwell authored two field goals thereafter, a 39-yarder with 7:55 to go and a 46-yarder as time expired to give the Packers a 16-13 win on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Favre completed 33 of 50 passes for 383 yards and that score, and he also had a big 17-yard rush in the fourth quarter.\n\n47. Favre can\u2019t make up his mind \u2026 buying a TV\n\nThis 2009 Sears advertisement showcased Favre poking fun at himself. Notorious for being unable to definitively say if he was returning to football or not, Favre is shown in the commercial hemming and hawing over TV options, ultimately unable to make a call. Packers fans, of course, know that his indecision played a role in the team ultimately moving on and trading Favre to the Jets.\n\n46. A frenzied fourth against the Chargers\n\nGreen Bay Packers Ahman Green snags a touchdown pass from Brett Favre during the fourth quarter of their game against the San Diego Chargers Sunday, December 14, 2003 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, Calif.

After the Chargers took a 21-17 lead, Favre found Robert Ferguson for a 40-yard go-ahead score, Ahman Green for a short touchdown and Ferguson again from 16 yards out to settle on a 38-21 win. Favre finished with 278 yards passing and four touchdowns overall.\n\n45.

It included Favre\u2019s 62-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman, followed shortly thereafter by a Steve Young fumble and a touchdown run by Travis Jervey. Favre threw three picks in the game but also three touchdowns and 279 yards passing. The 49ers got even in a memorable wild-card game in which Terrell Owens caught a game-winning touchdown (but Jerry Rice fumbled).\n\n44.

But in 2013 at the third annual \u201cNFL Honors\u201d show commemorating the best in the NFL, Rodgers and Favre took the podium together and handed out the Comeback Player of the Year award to Peyton Manning. It was somewhat awkward but largely a symbol that Rodgers \u2014 and, perhaps, Packers nation at large \u2014 was ready to move on and welcome Favre back into the fold.\n\n43. A rally in Jacksonville\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre runs in for a touchdown during the closing moments of the fourth quarter of their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars Monday, December 3, 2001 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Fla. (Photo: Mark Hoffman)\n\nDec. 3, 2001\n\nThe 7-3 Packers were on the cusp of a bad loss against the Jaguars, down 21-7 late in the third quarter. But Favre threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Bill Schroeder and another to Bubba Franks to tie the game before the quarter was over. He then ran it in himself from 6 yards out with 1:30 to go for the winning points in the 28-21 victory. All told, Favre finished with 362 yards passing and three scores, plus the rushing touchdown.\n\n42. Favre makes his own call\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre talks with head coach Mike Holmgren on the sideline.

It was Favre\u2019s play call after Mike Holmgren called something different, but Favre insisted on a play-action fake that set up Harris. It was one of three fourth-quarter comebacks in Favre\u2019s rookie year.\n\n41.

He played Diaz\u2019s ex-boyfriend (after Drew Bledsoe and Steve Young turned down the Farrelly brothers for the part?!).\n\n40. The Wrangler commercials\n\nFavre became a pitchman for Wrangler jeans during its \u201cReal. Comfortable.

It was a hideous \"Monday Night Football\" battle at Soldier Field that the Packers dominated (33-6) despite just 82 yards passing on 6 of 15 completions from Favre. But he did deliver a 36-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, and the Packers wound up taking a 27-0 lead.\n\n38. His first and only Lambeau Leap\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre leaps into the crowd after rushing for a touchdown during the third quarter of an NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Sunday, Oct. 29, 2006, in Green Bay.

That didn\u2019t come until 2006, when he jumped in after a 1-yard run against the Arizona Cardinals. The Packers won the game 31-14.\n\n37.

(Photo: Mark Hoffman, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nNov. 11, 2007\n\nThe 2007 season was a renaissance for Favre, who seemed to rediscover every ounce of his magic with a newfound efficiency. The Packers moved to 8-1 against the Vikings in a 34-0 evisceration, where Favre completed 33 of 46 passes for 351 yards and three scores. Aaron Rodgers also made an appearance in the game, going 2-for-2.\n\n36.

(Photo: Benny Sieu, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nNov. 14, 2004, and Dec. 24, 2004\n\nA win over the Vikings is always sweet for the Packers, but two walk-off wins in the same season is pretty great. Ryan Longwell\u2019s kick at the buzzer helped the Packers prevail 34-31 despite two fourth-quarter touchdowns by the Vikings in the final 3 minutes. Favre did not throw an interception and completed 20 of 29 passes for 236 yards and four scores, good for a 133 quarterback rating. In the rematch Dec. 24, Favre found Donald Driver for a touchdown with 3:34 left to tie it, and after the Packers forced a punt, Favre took the ball at the Green Bay 13 and drove to the Minnesota 7 over the course of 1 minute and 20 seconds. A 31-yard pass to Javon Walker was the biggest play that set up Longwell\u2019s game winner in the 34-31 victory, a win ensured the Packers would finish ahead of the Vikings for the NFC North crown. Green Bay followed with a win over the Bears but lost to the Vikings in the wild-card round, 31-24.\n\n35. Another thriller in 1999\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre (4) gets away from Tampa Bay Buccaneers Chidi Ahanotu (72) and Warren Sapp (99) to complete a pass in the first quarter Sunday night, Oct. 10, 1999, in Green Bay.

Favre\u2019s 21-yard completion for a touchdown to Antonio Freeman despite pass interference from Tampa Bay defensive back Ronde Barber gave the Packers the lead with 1:10 to play, less than a minute after the Buccaneers took the lead on a Mike Alstott touchdown. Favre delivered a 42-yard pass to Bill Schroeder on the winning drive.\n\n34.

Ahman Green\u2019s touchdown rush with less than 2 minutes to go helped the Packers pull away, 25-15.\n\n33.

(Photo: File photo)\n\nDec. 28, 2003\n\nThe day will be remembered for the Vikings' inexplicable loss to the Cardinals in Tempe, when Minnesota coughed up an 11-point lead in the fourth quarter and enabled the Packers to clinch a playoff spot. One week after Favre\u2019s magnificent performance on \"Monday Night Football\" in the wake of his father\u2019s death, the Packers rolled again over Denver, 31-3, to set the stage for the dramatic Vikings loss and squeaking out the NFC North title. It was far from Favre\u2019s best game (12 of 21, 116 yards), but he did throw an early touchdown to Bubba Franks in a game that largely featured the running of Ahman Green (218 yards on 20 carries).\n\n32. \u2018We\u2019ll take the ball, and we\u2019re gonna score\u2019\n\nGreen Bay Packers Al Harris exalts after he returned an interception for the game-winning touchdown in overtime against the Seattle Seahawks Sunday, January 4, 2004 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Photo: Tom Lynn)\n\nJan. 4, 2004\n\nIt\u2019s a game that will be remembered for the pass thrown by Favre\u2019s former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Matt Hasselbeck, into the arms of Al Harris for a game-winning pick-six in overtime. The 2003 wild-card game against the Seahawks capped a series of dramatic weeks for the Packers that included a memorable \"Monday Night Football\" game for Favre in Oakland and remarkable choke job by the Minnesota Vikings in Arizona one week later. In the playoffs, the Packers prevailed 33-27 one week before \u201cfourth-and-26\u201d became part of our permanent vocabulary. But Favre was also excellent in this game, completing 26 of 38 for 319 yards and a touchdown.\n\n31. The Warren Sapp rivalry\n\nGreen Bay Packers Brett Favre embraces Tampa Bay Buccaneers Warren Sapp following Green Bay's 20-13 win Sunday, November 16, 2003 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. (Photo: File photo)\n\nFavre had a playful and professional rivalry with Warren Sapp, the Tampa Bay defensive lineman who frequently made life miserable for quarterbacks. The rivalry between the two foes was perhaps at its best in 1998, when Favre beat Sapp in September, 23-15 (though Sapp had two sacks). In December, Sapp and his Buccaneers got even with a 24-22 win, even though Favre made it interesting at the end by driving the Packers into Tampa Bay territory, only to be sacked by Sapp for the final down of the game.\n\n30. A dash of Schadenfreude\n\nWith 10:19 left in overtime of the 2009 NFC Championship Game, New Orleans kicker Garrett Hartley booted a 40-yard field goal to win the game over the Vikings and send the Saints to their first Super Bowl \u2014 which they won over the Colts. The ramifications of the game that got them there were more far-reaching. The Saints were the only team to have a possession in that overtime frame, and it\u2019s a common belief that because Vikings quarterback Brett Favre was denied an opportunity to handle the ball in response to the Saints\u2019 field goal, the league moved to change the rules. From then on, overtime wasn\u2019t just a one-possession contest unless the first team handling the ball scored a touchdown (or the defensive team scored). If a field goal was kicked, the opposing team would have a chance to tie or win the game. Was this an improvement? Not really, when the NCAA\u2019s overtime rules are far superior when it comes to making an overtime period competitive.\n\nJan. 24, 2010\n\nWe did promise that this list would feature moments that are exclusively Packers-friendly and not include any of the lowlights. But we can\u2019t not mention this one. Favre\u2019s wishes to play for the divisional rival Vikings rubbed a lot of Packers fans the wrong way, especially when he led the Vikings to two wins over the Packers in 2009 and put them one step away from the Super Bowl. But an overtime interception in the NFC championship game from inside Saints territory took away a potential game-winning scoring opportunity, and the Saints won 31-28. \"This is not Detroit, man, this is the Super Bowl.\"\n\n29.

(Photo: Benny Sieu)\n\nOct. 14, 2001\n\nOne of Favre\u2019s best games came against the defending Super Bowl champion Ravens, when they paid a visit to Lambeau Field in October 2001. Favre completed 27 of 34 passes for 337 yards, three scores and no interceptions as the Packers knocked off Baltimore 31-23.\n\n28.

(Photo: John Gapps III)\n\nJan. 25, 1998\n\nSure, it was a rough ending, when the Broncos stunned the Packers in Super Bowl XXXII, 31-24. But it\u2019s easy to forget that Favre still threw for three touchdowns, pulling the Packers into a tie early in the fourth quarter on a touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman and quickly engineering a drive that started on the Packers\u2019 15-yard line. All told, Favre completed 25 of 42 passes, though he did lose a fumble and throw an interception.\n\n27. The OTHER Raiders game\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre holds his hand after injuring it during the third quarter of their game aginast the Oakland Raiders Sunday, September 12, 1999 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Photo: Rick Wood)\n\nSept. 12, 1999\n\nNursing a badly injured thumb, Favre nonetheless found a way to lead the Packers to a thrilling comeback against the Oakland Raiders in the 1999 season opener, completing 28 of 47 passes for 333 yards and four touchdowns. The Packers fell behind 24-14 with 11:27 to go, but Favre\u2019s touchdown pass to Corey Bradford came just more than 30 seconds later, and his game-winning pass to Jeff Thomason tipped the scales with 15 seconds to go.\n\n26. The Packers are for real in 1996\n\nGreen Bay Packers Reggie White (right) gives quarterback Brett Favre a hug after their 23-20 overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers Monday, October 14, 1996 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis.

Favre\u2019s 59-yard touchdown pass to Don Beebe pulled the Packers to within 3 points, and he drove the Packers down the field to set up a game-tying field goal with 8 seconds left, plus the game-winning points in overtime from Chris Jacke. Favre finished 28-for- 61 with 395 yards passing.\n\n25. Driver for 90 yards\n\nGreen Bay Packers wide receiver Donald Driver is embraced by teammates after he scored a touchdown on a 90-yard reception during the second quarter of their NFC Championship game against the New York Giants Sunday, January 20, 2008 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Photo: Mark Hoffman, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nJan. 20, 2008\n\nIn the brutal cold of Brett Favre\u2019s final game wearing a Green Bay Packers jersey, Donald Driver caught a pass and went 90 yards for a touchdown in the NFC championship battle with the Giants, briefly putting the Packers ahead 7-6. The game went back and forth from there and had an unhappy ending most people remember, when Favre\u2019s interception to Corey Webster in overtime helped seal Green Bay\u2019s fate. Lawrence Tynes kicked a game-winning field goal to send the Giants to the Super Bowl.\n\n24. The draft photo\n\nApril 21, 1991\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a member of the Packers yet, but a draft-day photograph of Favre in 1991 essentially became an iconic visual in Packers culture, with numerous trinkets of awesomeness buried within the image. It was pretty great when now-Browns quarterback (and Christian Yelich enthusiast) Baker Mayfield re-created the photo when he was taken No. 1 overall in 2018.\n\n23.

The 49ers were a 10-point favorite, but Favre threw for 299 yards and two touchdowns in the victory, with scores to Keith Jackson and Mark Chmura that helped the Packers grab a 21-0 lead.\n\n22. The streak\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre holds up the game ball after taking the first snap in the game against the Chicago Bears Sunday, Nov. 7, 1999, in Green Bay, Wis.

(Photo: Mike Roemer)\n\nNov. 7, 1999\n\nFavre started for the 117th time, in a loss to the Chicago Bears, passing Ron Jaworksi for the most consecutive starts. The streak lasted throughout his tenure in Green Bay and ultimately finished at 297 (321 if you count the playoffs), a mark that may never be broken. It officially ran from Sept. 27, 1992, to Dec. 5, 2010.\n\n21.

Favre, whose streak of consecutive games played set an NFL record, set another record for speech length with his unscripted thoughts.\n\n20.

The Packers crushed the Seahawks 42-20 as Favre threw for three touchdowns and completed 18 of 23 passes (173 yards). Perhaps most memorable was a falling shovel pass to Donald Lee for 10 yards on third-and-8 for a big first down before the end of the half.\n\n19. Carolina on the mind\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre releases a shuttle pass to Dorsey Levens for a first down while in the grasp of Carolina Panthers linebacker Kevin Green during the third quarter of the 1997 NFC Championship game Sunday, January 12, 1997 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Photo: Dale Guldan, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nJan. 12, 1997\n\nIncluding a long scoring pass to Dorsey Levens and a beautiful back-shoulder touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman that would later be immortalized on the cover of Sports Illustrated, Favre led the Packers to a landslide win over Carolina in the 1996 NFC championship game to reach Super Bowl XXXI. Favre finished with 292 yards passing and two scores.\n\n18.

But Favre was excellent as well, completing 23 of 32 passes for 301 yards and two scores, enabling the Packers to prevail 24-19 on Christmas Eve. He took a massive hit before re-entering the game to sling a huge touchdown to Mark Chmura.\n\n17.

His game-winning pass to Edgar Bennett for 16 yards gave the Packers the lead for good at the 9:17 mark. Favre finished with a 147.2 passer rating for the game.\n\n16.

Five days before he was traded, more than 56,000 people attended the annual Family Night Scrimmage at Lambeau shortly after it was clear Favre had decided to play in the 2008 season and not retire. Other fans waited at nearby Austin Straubel Airport when Favre\u2019s plane landed at 7 p.m. His plane\u2019s taxi to the gate was broadcast on live television, and his Cadillac Escalade ride was followed by news helicopters. He wound up at the game and sitting in one of the luxury boxes, with nobody clear on whether the Packers would welcome him back or move on.\n\n15.

The Packers general manager sent a first-round draft pick to Atlanta for the 22-year-old Favre, even though Favre had been a second-round draft choice just the year before and had yet to see NFL action. One often forgotten nugget: Wolf entertained the idea of trading for 30-year-old Steve Young from the 49ers but opted instead to go for the unproven Favre.\n\n13. A record that will never be broken\n\n1995 SEASON: Green Bay Packers' Robert Brooks (87) takes a reception 99 yards for a touchdown as the Chicago Bears' Donnell Woolford (21) looks on during the second quarter in Chicago on Sept. 11, 1995.

Keiser/AP)\n\nSept. 11, 1995\n\nFacing the Chicago Bears in Week 2 of 1995 on \"Monday Night Football,\" Favre threw three touchdown passes in the first half, and the third was a 99-yard bomb to Robert Brooks that gave the Packers a 21-0 lead. Green Bay held on at Soldier Field, 27-24.\n\n12. Corey Bradford tops the Vikings\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre is embraced by teammate Brian Williams after Favre threw a touchdown pass in the waning moments of the fourth during the third quarter of their game against the Minnesota Vikings Sunday, September 26, 1999 at Lambeau Field.

But that\u2019s way too much time for Favre. It took him seven plays to respond, capping the drive on fourth-and-1 with a perfect 23-yard pass to Corey Bradford with 16 seconds left, helping the Packers prevail 23-20.\n\n11. The MVP times three\n\nFarve won three straight NFL Most Valuable Player awards. (Photo: JIM GEHRZ, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nIn 1996, Favre won his second NFL MVP, becoming just the third player in league history to win the award twice (along with Earl Campbell and Steve Young). Then, in 1997, he won it a third time to become the first NFL player accomplishing the feat. The feat has since been matched by Tom Brady and surpassed by Peyton Manning, but no player has won the award three consecutive years as Favre did from 1995-97.\n\n10. Favre\u2019s strange first pass\n\nBrett Favre throws a pass as he warms up on Dec. 30, 1992, during his first season with the Packers. (Photo: Journal Sentinel files)\n\nSept. 13, 1992\n\nThe trivia question is often posed: who caught Brett Favre\u2019s first NFL completion? The answer, as many of us know by now, is himself. Facing the Buccaneers in Week 2, Favre checked in with the Packers well behind in what ultimately became a 31-3 loss. Rolling to his right, Favre released a pass deflected into the air by Ray Seals and right back to Favre, who was then tackled for a loss. It got better from there.\n\n9.

A 7-yard pass to Donald Driver to kick off the next series gave the record to Favre alone. He finished with 71,838 passing yards, still fourth all time in 2019.\n\n8. Tying and then passing Dan Marino the first time\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre reacts after breaking Dan Marino's record for career touchdown passes after throwing a touchdown pass to teammate Greg Jennings at the Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minn., on Sunday, Sept. 30, 2007. (Photo: Evan Siegle/Press-Gazette Media/@PGevansiegle)\n\nSept. 23 and Sept. 30, 2007\n\nWith his 16-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings in the first quarter Sept. 3, 2007, Favre completed his 421st touchdown pass, officially passing Dan Marino for most in NFL history. He finished his career with 508, the fourth-most in NFL history. But tying the record was the more dramatic note with a 57-yard strike to Greg Jennings with 2:03 to go to help the Packers beat San Diego, 31-24. Favre finished that game with 369 yards passing and three scores.\n\n7. The walk-off bomb on Monday night\n\nGreen Bay Packers wide receiver Greg Jennings celebrates his game-winning 82 yard touchdown reception in overtime during their game against the Denver Broncos Monday, October 29, 2007 at Invesco Field at Mile High in Denver, Colo. (Photo: MARK HOFFMAN, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nOct. 29, 2007\n\nIn 2007 \u2014 perhaps Favre\u2019s most memorable year (for better and worse) \u2014 he took the first snap of overtime and aired out a long pass to Greg Jennings for a walk-off winner in overtime on \"Monday Night Football.\" The 82-yard bomb gave the Packers a 19-13 win over host Denver and moved Green Bay to 6-1 on the season (they\u2019d eventually go 10-1 and finish 13-3).\n\n6. Favre takes it himself in the County Stadium finale\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre dives into the end zone to score the game-winning touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons December 18, 1994 at Milwaukee County Stadium.

Favre dropped back on third down in the final 20 seconds and ran the final 9 yards, diving across the goal line for the winning points with 3 seconds to play. The Packers wound up beating the Lions in the playoffs for a second straight year, famously holding Barry Sanders to negative-1 yard rushing before falling to the Cowboys.\n\n5. The introduction\n\nGreen Bay quarterback Brett Favre made his first mark in the NFL against the Cincinnati Bengals in 1992.

His 35-yard pass to Kitrick Taylor with 14 seconds left capped a 92-yard drive and helped the Packers rally all the way back from a 17-3 deficit to win 24-23. The Packers scored three fourth-quarter touchdowns for the thrilling birth of Brett Favre\u2019s legend.\n\n4. The Antonio Freeman pass\n\nThe football dropped by Vikings cornerback Chris Dishman hits the arm of Green Bay Packers Antonio Freeman as he lies on the ground.

(Photo: RICK WOOD, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nNov. 6, 2000\n\nOn a rainy Monday night at Lambeau in November of 2000 against the Vikings, Favre\u2019s pass to Antonio Freeman on third-and-4 appeared to fall incomplete, defended by Vikings defensive back Cris Dishman. But Freeman corralled the ball and ran for the game-winning touchdown in overtime, and replays showed what he knew immediately \u2014 the ball never touched the ground. It might be the single most memorable pass Favre threw.\n\n3. The playoff drought is over\n\nSterlin Sharpe prepares to catch the game-winning touchdown pass with 55 seconds left against the Detroit Lions in 1994.

The 40-yard bomb across his body was enough to tip the scales and give the Packers a 28-24 win that somewhat ushered in a new era of Packers football.\n\n2. Running down a dream\n\nBrett Favre celebrates a touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman in Super Bowl XXXI.

Favre threw another touchdown pass and two-point conversion in the game, finished with 246 passing yards and also ran for a score in the 35-21 triumph.\n\n1. A win for dad\n\nGreen Bay Packers Brett Favre waves to his wife, Deanna, in a luxury box after throwing his fourth touchdown pass of the game during the second quarter of their game against the Oakland Raiders Monday, December 22, 2003 at Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Tom Lynn)\n\nDec. 22, 2003\n\nSure, the Super Bowl win will resonate for a long time, but can anything top his \"Monday Night Football\" performance in 2003, a 41-7 win over the Oakland Raiders? One day after the death of his father, Irv, he threw for 399 yards with four touchdowns in what will forever be remembered as his signature performance. By quarterback rating (154.9), it was the greatest performance of his career.\n\nJR Radcliffe can be reached at (262) 361-9141 or jradcliffe@gannett.com.
