This is a day as grueling as the Queen's coronation 25 years ago.'\n\nThe viewer replied to the trailer: 'Interesting. The Silver Jubilee was 24 years after the coronation, not 25.'\n\nOne fan defended the show, arguing: 'It was 25 years it was in 1977, The Queen came to the throne on February 6, 1952, and her coronation took place on June 2, 1953. She celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977 (25 years on the throne)'.\n\nHowever original viewer was quick to snap back: '\"This is jubilee day,\" the speaker says and the subtitles read, \"as gruelling as the Queen's coronation 25 years ago\". Incorrect. The coronation took place 24 years before Jubilee Day.'\n\nThe clip stated that Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee took place 25-years after her coronation, however the fan insisted that it was in fact only 24-years\n\nThe trailer shows Olivia, 45, and Helena, 53, taking over from Claire Foy and Vanessa Kirby in their respective roles and the clip was released early following a blunder from Netflix Japan.\n\nIt teased The Queen will face her darkest time on the throne yet as she battles the miners' strike, national security, sibling rivalry and family conflict ahead of her 1977 Silver Jubilee.\n\nThe solemn tone is made evident in the trailer which starts with the Silver Jubilee, marking her Majesty's 25 years on the throne.\n\nThe trailer also shows Helena Bonham Carter, 53, taking over the role of Princess Margaret, previously played by Vanessa Kirby,31\n\nThe trailer gave a sneak peak into the forthcoming season, and will explore the hardship faced by Britain in the 1970s\n\nBut behind the grandeur of the horse-drawn carriages and the glittering tiara, it shows the monarch questioning her role.\n\nBob Dylan's These Times Are A-Changin' plays in the background as she says: 'This country was still great when I came to the throne, all that's happened on my watch is that the place has fallen apart.'\n\nIt then flashes to the miners strike, police rebellion and the narrative: 'The country is bankrupt, our national security is in tatters.'\n\nBritain was faced with hardship in the 1970s, with the country at war over the miners' strike in 1972 and again in 1974 during the Three-Day Week, when electricity was rationed to three days a week.", "description": "After Netflix's the crown dropped it's season three trailer, one eagle-eyed viewer noticed that producers on the show had incorrectly dated a major royal milestone, the Queens coronation.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/11/20078252-0-image-a-18_1571826391781.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
