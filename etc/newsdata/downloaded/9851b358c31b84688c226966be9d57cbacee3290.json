The five cars that were set ablaze belonged to employees of the centre, one of which was a police car.\n\nAccording to a report from the Times of Malta, the riot began when a Nigerian man had been refused re-entry into the centre because he was drunk, a violation of the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS) rules. An argument between the man and the police broke out, and when officers tried to arrest him, other migrants joined in and began fighting with the police.\n\nSeveral migrants set cars and rooms on fire at a migrant compound in Malta as the migrant crisis in Europe continues to get worse. pic.twitter.com/bBuH4WlfAL \u2014 ANews (@anewscomtr) October 21, 2019\n\nThe riot ended when riot police entered the compound in the early hours of Monday morning.
