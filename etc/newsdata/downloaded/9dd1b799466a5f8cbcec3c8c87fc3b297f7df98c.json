Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, told House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that the White House transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president omitted crucial words and phrases, and that his attempts to include them failed, according to three people familiar with the testimony.\n\nThe omissions, Colonel Vindman said, included Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2026\n\nThe rough transcript also contains ellipses at three points where Mr. Trump is speaking. Colonel Vindman told investigators that at the point of the transcript where the third set of ellipses appears, Mr. Trump said there were tapes of Mr. Biden.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s mention of tapes is an apparent reference to Mr. Biden\u2019s comments at a January 2018 event about his effort to get Ukraine to force out its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Alexander-Vindman-Trump-Ukraine.Html Smid Nytcore-Ios-Share"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
