It is impossible to completely mitigate the significant disruption which would be caused by no deal.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It says \u201cwe can\u2019t possibly get fully ready for a shock like that and you damn well know it\u201d.\n\nMike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said this via Twitter: \u201cAuto has been consistent & clear: Spent over \u00a31/2 bn on prep but can\u2019t fully mitigate serious risks. Need deal & free & frictionless trade.\u201d\n\nNeither of these organisations would appear phased by the reports of businesses and business groups being told to belt up with the Brexit criticism if they want access to ministers.\n\nI\u2019ve heard those reports, and from good sources. I\u2019ve also heard reports of certain trade bodies indulging in self-censorship because of the allergy a government dominated by zealots has to people pointing out the potential consequences of its actions.\n\nSo why are these two so willing to publicly slap down a cabinet minister like that? Aren\u2019t they risking their access?\n\nWell here\u2019s the thing: Gove has to put up with them effectively, and correctly, saying he gets his breakfast from the finest porkie pie emporium in Melton Mowbray because he needs them as much as they need him.\n\nIf Gove is to \u201cget ready for Brexit\u201d, so the dismal slogan of that dismal campaign goes, he needs retailers and carmakers to do as much preparation as possible, otherwise the shops will be half empty and the car factories will be shut down and the economic damage will be worse than even the grimmest of predictions.\n\nLet\u2019s say his boss finds a way to contrive \u2013 sorry, break the law to \u201cdeliver\u201d \u2013 a no-deal Brexit and people head to the polls after finding their supermarkets are half empty. Only the fruit loops will go for his party, and the election he says he wants but won\u2019t get until after 31 October will go very badly indeed.\n\nGuess who\u2019ll be there to take the blame if the no-deal preparations are tested and found wanting? The phrase \u201ctoo clever by half\u201d springs to mind for the Duchy\u2019s man.\n\nIt\u2019s harder for those businesses and groups not in \u201cessential to our half-assed plans\u201d category.\n\nBut trade bodies indulging in self-censorship to gain access should ask themselves what they are achieving by indulging in it.\n\nIt will ultimately prove to be self-defeating. As for those ministers and officials saying shh? If they really are so thin-skinned that they won\u2019t listen to critical voices, they\u2019re part of a very bad government indeed.
