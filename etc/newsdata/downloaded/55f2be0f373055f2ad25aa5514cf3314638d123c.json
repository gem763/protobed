These diseases \u2014 among them Chagas disease and hookworm \u2015 are poorly understood, even by medical professionals, and disproportionately impact low-income communities of color that lack access to health care and proper sanitation or housing. Combating them has proved nearly impossible, due to a lack of funding and coordination across government agencies and private organizations.\n\nNew legislation introduced Wednesday by presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) aims to change this by raising awareness, promoting new research and providing funding to help fight these diseases in America, bringing patients out of the shadows and into treatment programs.\n\n\u201cThis is an injustice that has been largely hidden from most Americans and highlights a gross inequality, where large swaths of this country are regularly exposed to raw sewage and contaminated drinking water,\u201d Booker said in a statement provided to HuffPost.\n\nDiseases of poverty tend to be associated with the developing world and not with the United States. One billion people across the globe suffer from at least one of these conditions. HuffPost has reported extensively on efforts to target and cure neglected diseases in poorer countries. At the same time, the prevalence of such diseases has been almost completely overlooked in the U.S.\n\nBooker\u2019s proposed legislation \u2015 the Study, Treat, Observe, and Prevent (STOP) Neglected Diseases of Poverty Act \u2015 would create an interagency task force to educate the medical community on these diseases and increase surveillance in at-risk communities across the country. The measure would also free up public health funding for states to conduct new research into who has these diseases and where they live, and would encourage drug developers to explore new and better treatments.\n\nAnna Leah for HuffPost Environmental justice advocate Catherine Flowers examines an open sewer in the yard of a Lowndes County, Alabama, resident. Repeated exposure to raw sewage can lead to hookworm infections.\n\nHuffPost has previously reported on hookworm infections in America, which result from walking barefoot in raw sewage. The disease causes anemia and fatigue and can lead to impaired cognition in children. It was thought to have been eliminated in the U.S., but a 2017 study out of Lowndes County, Alabama, found several people with hookworms inside their bodies.\n\nThe population of Lowndes is majority African American, and many are descendants of slaves who toiled on cotton plantations. Today, the area has a high instance of people living with raw sewage flowing through their property due to failed septic systems. HuffPost toured some of these properties and met with residents who were frustrated about the lack of resources to deal with the wastewater problem.\n\n\u201cIn our nation, we can do better,\u201d said environmental justice advocate Catherine Flowers, who for years has been sounding the alarm about sanitation issues in Lowndes County.\n\nFlowers told HuffPost that the STOP Neglected Diseases of Poverty Act is an opportunity to bring relief to communities that are suffering. \u201cWe can find real solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis [legislation] is a great way to begin.\u201d\n\nAnna Leah for HuffPost Community activist Aaron Thigpen examines raw waste pooling next to a mobile home in Lowndes County, Alabama.\n\nHuffPost has also reported on patients affected by Chagas disease who live in Los Angeles, many of them immigrants who grew up in poverty in Latin American countries. The parasitic disease is transmitted by a biting insect. The bug injects a parasite, which burrows into the heart tissue and can remain dormant in the victim for decades. If untreated, the parasite may cause massive heart attacks and death.\n\nChagas is prevalent in rural areas of Latin America, and physicians in America aren\u2019t trained to conduct routine screenings for it, even though the bugs that transmit the disease are found in the Southern half of the U.S. and patients have been infected in this country. Treatments are available for Chagas, though they\u2019re difficult to obtain and come with debilitating side effects.\n\nPatients HuffPost spoke to in LA said they wished they had been tested for the disease earlier in life, when there\u2019s still a chance to kill the parasite before it damages the heart.\n\nPaul Ojuara via Getty Images A biting insect called the \"kissing bug\" carries a parasite in its gut which can infect humans with the deadly Chagas disease.\n\nLegislation like the STOP Neglected Diseases of Poverty Act could make a \u201chuge difference\u201d in the amount of money available for research, education and testing for neglected diseases in the U.S., said Dr. Colin Forsyth, Chagas research manager for the medical charity Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative. Combatting neglected diseases is a humanitarian issue, Forsyth said, but it also makes economic sense.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re catching these problems earlier and dealing with them, it\u2019s so much more medically effective, and it prevents costs on the health care system down the road,\u201d Forsyth said.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, a leading advocate for ending neglected diseases around the world, said he\u2019s cautiously optimistic about the Senate bill. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, pointed out that this is not the first time lawmakers have proposed a measure to combat neglected diseases in America.\n\nA bill calling for better research and treatment of neglected diseases both in the U.S. and abroad was introduced in the House of Representatives in January, but it failed to gain traction. And though several government agencies are already involved in fighting these diseases in America, those efforts haven\u2019t been enough so far, said Hotez.\n\nNeglected diseases are America\u2019s \u201cmost glaring health disparity,\u201d Hotez told HuffPost.\n\nIf it matters to you, it matters to us.
