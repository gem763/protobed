Whew.\n\nHere are the six wackiest moments from Game 6:\n\nAD\n\nAlex Bregman homers, carries his bat to first base\n\nWith two outs in the first inning, the Astros\u2019 third baseman and presumptive American League MVP crushed a solo home run to left field off Strasburg that gave Houston a 2-1 lead. Rather than drop, or even flip, his bat at home plate, Bregman carried his lumber all the way to first base before fumbling an exchange with Astros first base coach Don Kelly. The bat ended up in fair territory as Bregman jogged toward second base.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe was trying to hand this bat off to his first base coach, and I\u2019m sure his first base coach was like, \u2018I\u2019ve never had this happen to me,' \" Fox analyst John Smoltz said on the broadcast.\n\nAD\n\nThis dude @ABREG_1 really carried the bat to 1st base.\n\n\n\nLegend. pic.twitter.com/TQqhfSVjUq \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cI just thought that was pretty tired,\u201d Strasburg said, when asked about Bregman\u2019s antics after the game.\n\nMajor League Baseball debuted a \u201cWe Play Loud\u201d ad campaign at the start of the postseason that celebrated some of its young stars\u2019 willingness to challenge the game\u2019s various unwritten rules, including the proper way to act after hitting home run, but Bregman\u2019s bat carry crossed a line in the eyes of some former players.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s asking to get someone hurt on your team,\u201d former National Mike Morse tweeted.\n\nI dont think I\u2019ve ever seen a guy carry his bat all the way to first. If this wasn\u2019t the world series he would get one in the ear. \u2014 Paul Lo Duca (@paulloduca16) October 30, 2019\n\nBregman ... dude taking the bat all the way to first....that\u2019s asking to get someone hurt on your team ... next year . Right now focuses on winning #WorldSeries \u2014 Michael Morse (@MorseBeWithU) October 30, 2019\n\nIf you carry a bat to first base you\u2019d better have ball and shot ready, seconds at your side, a formal writ declaring your intent to duel, and a shallow grave already dug. \u2014 Old Hoss Radboooooooourn (@OldHossRadbourn) October 30, 2019\n\nAfter the game, Bregman apologized, saying he let his emotions get the best of him and \u201cthat\u2019s not how I was raised to play the game.\u201d Bregman has D.C. baseball ties: His grandfather, Washington lawyer and political insider Stan Bregman, convinced Bob Short to purchase the expansion Senators in the late 1960s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJuan Soto homers, carries bat to first base\n\nSoto apparently didn\u2019t turn around to admire Bregman\u2019s no-doubter for long, because he didn\u2019t miss the Astros slugger\u2019s arrival at first base.\n\n\u201cSince I saw that, what Bregman did in the first inning, I was like, \u2018That looks pretty cool,' \" Soto told MLB Network after the game. \u201cI want to do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\"I saw that, what Bregman did in the first inning... I was like, 'that was pretty cool, I wanna do that.'\" - Juan Soto@Nationals | #STAYINTHEFIGHT | #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/blurqO6cIX \u2014 MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) October 30, 2019\n\nSo Soto did, carrying his bat to first base coach Tim Bogar after taking Justin Verlander deep with a moonshot to right field in the fifth inning that broke a 2-2 tie.\n\nNationals Manager Dave Martinez didn\u2019t appreciate Bregman or Soto\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Martinez said afterward. \u201cAnd the fact that Soto did it, I\u2019ll be quite honest with you, I didn\u2019t like it when he did it as well. It\u2019s a conversation I\u2019ll have with Juan. That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThey\u2019re carrying their bats to first base now.

Astros reliever Brad Peacock fielded it and fired to first, but his throw led first baseman Yuli Gurriel\u2019s glove into Turner\u2019s path. As Turner hit first base, Gurriel\u2019s glove fell off and the ball trickled into right field. Gomes and Turner each advanced one base on the play.\n\nAD\n\nBut home plate umpire Sam Holbrook ruled that Turner had interfered with Gurriel\u2019s ability to catch Peacock\u2019s throw. Turner was ruled out. Gomes was returned to first. Martinez and Nationals fans, including D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, were irate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHey Alexa,\u201d Bowser tweeted after the call. \u201cCan a mayor fire an umpire?\u201d\n\nTrea Turner was called out on this play.\n\n\n\n\"That's a potentially series changing call.\" - Joe @Buck pic.twitter.com/E3Po7hSNcR \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\nTurner was frustrated, too, and Fox\u2019s microphones in the dugout caught him pointing at chief baseball officer Joe Torre, who was sitting nearby.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sitting with his head down trying not to look up,\u201d Turner shouted, as Holbrook and the umpiring crew donned headsets during a 10-minute delay that left everyone \u2014 from the players and fans at Minute Maid Park, to Fox\u2019s broadcasters and those watching at home \u2014 thoroughly confused.\n\nAD\n\nSorry even we can't help with this one https://t.co/LNtIEYUM8K \u2014 Baseball Reference (@baseball_ref) October 30, 2019\n\nTrea Turner: \u201cJoe Torre is sitting right there \u2026 he\u2019s sitting with his head down trying not to look up.\u201d pic.twitter.com/BM92dbAKGN \u2014 Joon Lee (@joonlee) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cWait \u2018til you watch,\u201d Martinez yelled at Holbrook from the dugout, suggesting the umpire would realize he made a bad call once he saw the replay. \u201cWait 'til you watch.\u201d\n\nRendon told Fox\u2019s Ken Rosenthal that he was \u201cactually pretty happy about the delay\u201d because he \u201cgot to sit down for a little while\u201d before he went up to bat. After Adam Eaton popped out, a rested Rendon crushed a two-run homer to left to give the Nationals a 5-2 lead. Rendon added a two-run double in the ninth.\n\nAD\n\nDave Martinez gets ejected\n\n\u201cDavey was really out of control for a bit when he was yelling at Sam Holbrook,\u201d Torre, who defended the interference call, said on Fox\u2019s postgame show. \u201cThey went to the headset just to make sure that everything they were telling him was double-checked.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMartinez evidently wasn\u2019t satisfied with whatever explanation he received. During the seventh-inning stretch, he went after Holbrook again. Despite bench coach Chip Hale\u2019s best efforts, Martinez did enough to get ejected while fans were in the middle of singing \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame.\"\n\nMartinez became the first manager ejected in a World Series since Atlanta\u2019s Bobby Cox was tossed in Game 6 of the 1996 World Series for arguing a close play at second.\n\nChip Hale you gotta tighten up that grip man pic.twitter.com/oTcxOU4bwr \u2014 Jomboy (@Jomboy_) October 30, 2019\n\nI just want to point out that this meltdown happened during \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" which is not clear on the Fox broadcast, and it's hilarious pic.twitter.com/pHFJwSmLMQ \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) October 30, 2019\n\nThe away team wins again\n\nThis ridiculousness isn\u2019t unique to Game 6, but it\u2019s a remarkable aspect of Tuesday\u2019s result nonetheless. The Nationals have now outscored the Astros 24-9 in three road games during this World Series after being outscored 19-3 in three games at home over the weekend. For the first time in 1,420 best-of-seven series across MLB, the NHL and NBA, the road team has won the first six games. Game 7 is Wednesday in Houston. What sort of wackiness is in store?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the Nationals:", "description": "The Nationals' 7-2 win in Houston had a little bit of everything.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
