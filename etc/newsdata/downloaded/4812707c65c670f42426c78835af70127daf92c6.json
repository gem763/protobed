It is an old trick of political accountancy that many governments have used.\"\n\nIn his spending review announcement in Parliament on 4 September, Chancellor Sajid Javid used the smaller figure.\n\nHe said: \"Today we are delivering on our pledge to increase school spending by \u00a37.1 billion by 2022-23, compared with this year.\"\n\nImage caption The BBC posted the story on Facebook with its own headline\n\nFull Fact said that various versions of the advert with the altered headline had received between 222,000 and 510,000 impressions - although these can include multiple viewings by the same person.\n\nThe Facebook adverts - which started running on 2 September - have since been deactivated.\n\nA BBC spokesman said: \"We are looking into this matter.\"", "description": "The party says it is reviewing its Facebook advertising after criticism of the way a BBC story was used.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11F44/production/_108804537_hi016122252.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
