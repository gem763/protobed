Tyra Winters sprang into action during Rockwall High School\u2019s parade as soon as she heard someone yell for help, Fox 4 News reported.\n\nWinters, a high school senior whose mom had shown her how to do the Heimlich maneuver in case of an emergency, located the boy and his mother, Nicole Hornback, in the crowd. She told KTVT that she grabbed the boy, named Clark, from Hornback, tilted him and gave him three back thrusts before he spit up.\n\nNEW JERSEY BABY BORN WITH 'BRAIN OUTSIDE OF SKULL' BELIEVED TO BE FIRST TO SURVIVE CONDITION\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blessed that I could be there at the time because the story could have went 1,000 ways,\u201d she told the news outlet. \u201cI\u2019m just happy it went the way it did.
