I\u2019m not surprised because there are many cases, which we don\u2019t know about, also on other continents, where this is common too,\u201d she said.\n\nKampusch was kidnapped in 1998 at age 10 by Wolfgang Priklopil on the way to school in Vienna and held in an underground room measuring less than six square metres (65 square feet).\n\nShe recounts being starved, beaten and sexually abused in the room under Priklopil\u2019s house until her escape in 2006. Priklopil committed suicide the day she escaped.\n\nSince then, Kampusch has tried to live as normal a life as possible, reuniting with her family, making friends and finishing school, travelling and learning languages. For a short while she even had her own TV chat show.\n\nDespite her ordeal, Kampusch has received hate mail, been shouted at and even attacked by an old woman in the street.\n\nA lot of the antipathy towards her has been fuelled by the perception that she has become rich and by conspiracy theories swirling around over the past decade.\n\nAt her recent book publishing, she told media she refused to be silenced by hate postings \u2014 as her kidnapper had tried to do by locking her away.\n\nThe softly-spoken Kampusch told AFP in 2016 that adjusting back to a free life had been \u201cvery difficult\u201d.\n\n\u201cI had no foundation to build on, no socialisation with other young people, with people of my own age\u2026 But I\u2019m young and I have to swim with other people in the 21st century. I have to integrate myself in this century,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 New identity \u2013\n\nFritzl, on the other hand, who was 18 when her father Josef locked her in his purpose-built cellar in 1984, has disappeared from public view.\n\nHer father, claiming she had run away from home, kept her in the cellar of the family home west of Vienna until 2008, raping her repeatedly resulting in the birth of seven children, one of whom died just a few days old.\n\nThe case came to light when one of the surviving children became ill and had to be hospitalised.\n\nJosef Fritzl was jailed for life in 2009, being found guilty of murder for the baby\u2019s death as well as incest, sequestration, grievous assault and 3,000 instances of rape.\n\nElisabeth and her surviving children took on new identities and moved to an undisclosed location where they have lived quietly, with no details seeping out even in the Austrian tabloids.\n\nJosef, now 84, too has requested to change his name. He remains in prison.", "description": "Vienna (AFP) \u2013 The case of an Austrian suspected of holding a Dutch family captive for nearly a decade has sparked memories of two other", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/763b6c_josef-fritzl-imprisoned-his-daughter-elisabeth-24-years-fathered-children-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
