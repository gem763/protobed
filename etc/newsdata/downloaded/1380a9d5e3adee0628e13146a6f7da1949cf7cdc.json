These kind of studies need to be acted upon, whatever way that is.\n\n\u201cWith players, back in the day when the balls were a lot heavier, it had an affect.\u201d\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nAnother former professional footballer, Blackburn striker Chris Sutton, 46, has called for an immediate ban on children heading the ball.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have an eight-year-old daughter and I don\u2019t want her receiving repeated blows to her head from heading footballs.\u201d\n\nHe questioned why a week after the findings were revealed, the PFA and FA had not imposed a heading ban on under-12s.\n\nHe asked: \u201cAre the findings not serious enough?\u201d\n\n(Image: Paul Currie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe US banned children from heading the ball in 2014 and the Scottish FA is considering a similar move.\n\nNobby Stiles, Martin Peters and Ray Wilson, three players who helped England win the World Cup in 1966 were later diagnosed with dementia.\n\nTheir former team-mate, George Cohen, has also demanded an enquiry into dementia in football after the results of the study, which tracked 7,600 ex-professionals and compared them to 23,000 similar individuals in the general population.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Mirror, Cohen said: \u201cThere are a lot of unanswered questions and I think this needs to be fully investigated. We need more information.\n\n\u201cI imagine there will be many more players from that era.\n\n\u201cWe had no idea, we were just doing our jobs and heading the ball.\n\n\u201cI never thought my old teammates would have suffered like they have. We didn\u2019t understand in those days but we see it now the years have gone on.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs has called on bosses to act after a study on the risk of dementia in footballers", "authors": ["Kelly Allen", "Image", "Afp Photo", "-", "China Out- Afp Getty Images", "Reuters", "Paul Currie Bpi Rex Shutterstock", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12232739.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Wales-head-coach-Ryan-Giggs-looks-on-du.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
