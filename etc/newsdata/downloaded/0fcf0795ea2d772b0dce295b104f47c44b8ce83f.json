It's a place very close to my heart.\n\n'I think the world generally, we are much more divided. I come from a country [that has suffered from civil war.\n\n'So when people tell me this is a divisive time, I think \"put things in perspective\". We all believe in an open world.\n\n'We may disagree passionately about issues but still there is much more to life than politics.'\n\nMiriam told of how she recently launched 'Inspiring Girls' an initiative to encourage young women to pursue careers not traditionally chosen by women, such as those in science and mathematics\n\nMiriam recently launched 'Inspiring Girls' an initiative to encourage young women to pursue careers not traditionally chosen by women, such as those in science and mathematics.\n\nThe programme, which is based in 13 countries, works with girls from the ages of 12-14 and connects them to older female role models and the lawyer admitted that although she is mother to three boys, she still feels passionate about inspiring girls.\n\nShe said: 'It's important to make girls feel as empowered as boys.
