The problem is, all the supposed whistleblower can offer is a secondhand account.\n\nAccording to the complaint, President Trump tried to convince Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyto to dig up some dirt on Vice President Joe Biden. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate is fielding a controversy over the millions of dollars his son Hunter reportedly received while sitting on the board of a Ukrainian company. Yet, the \"whistleblower\" had no direct knowledge of Trump's conversation with Zelenskyto.\n\nMedia ran with the worst case scenario - that Trump abused his authority. But there are clearly holes in the narrative. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-FL) urged Trump to be as transparent with this story as possible because it will only help him.\n\n\"I think you\u2019re going to find more about that phone call in the coming days,\" Graham said in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt on Monday. \"You\u2019re going to be surprised about the level of transparency regarding that phone call. And in turn, that should put pressure on the system to find more about what Joe Biden was talking about.\"\n\nTrump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani found the same light at the end of the tunnel. This whole whistleblower scandal, will end up causing a bigger headache for Biden, he predicted. If the media does start paying more attention to Biden's scandal, the candidate will \"fall apart,\" Giuliani said.\n\nBoth Graham and Giuliani urged a DOJ investigation against the former vice president and Ukraine. It's only fair, Graham reasoned, because the Trumps \"have gone through hell\" as the target of investigations.\n\n\"Again, I admire Joe Biden,\" Graham said. \"I like his family. But the Trumps have gone through hell. Everything they\u2019ve ever said and done regarding Russia has been laid out. And you had, you know, a two-year investigation. So I hope the president will be transparent with a phone call that he made to the newly-elected Ukrainian president. I think he will, and I hope somebody in the Justice Department will look at the Ukrainian matter, not politicians.\"\n\nYou can read the full transcript of Sen. Graham's chat with Hugh Hewitt here.", "description": ".09/23/2019 15:09:22PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/3ffbd9c2-ecb4-4697-af5f-4164127cf398.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
