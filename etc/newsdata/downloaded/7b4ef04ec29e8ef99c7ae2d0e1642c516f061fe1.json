The Kentucky politician jokingly said, \"First Zion. Now Me\" in reference to former Duke basketball star Zion Williamson memorably experiencing a similar fate, despite no injury, when his Nike shoes exploded during a game last season.\n\nThe Senate is now back from its summer recess, and it looks like Sen. McConnell's colleague Susan Collins has gifted the GOP leader a new pair of shoes to replace his old Nikes. Senator Collins represents the state of Maine, where the shoe company New Balance has several factories. Nearly all of its shoes are famously made in the USA.\n\n\"After @senatemajldr had a major @Nike fail, @SenatorCollins presented him with red, white and blue @newbalance replacements made in Maine, USA,\" Texas senator John Cornyn tweeted.\n\n\n\nAfter ?@senatemajldr? had a major ?@Nike? fail, ?@SenatorCollins? presented him with with ?red, white and blue ?@newbalance? replacements made in Maine, USA. pic.twitter.com/6rtvAo2JmD \u2014 Senator John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) September 19, 2019\n\n\"Our commitment to domestic manufacturing allows New Balance to employ American workers at our five facilities in Maine and Massachusetts,\" New Balance's website reads. \"Whenever possible, we purchase materials from domestic suppliers who employ more than 7,000 workers locally.\" New Balance was started in 1906 by an English immigrant in Boston, Massachusetts.", "description": ".09/19/2019 19:06:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/262/a2b820c4-8913-486b-a09b-1845191ffc8a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
