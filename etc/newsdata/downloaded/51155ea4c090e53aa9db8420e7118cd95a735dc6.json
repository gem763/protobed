The league reportedly set a new record for penalties assessed in 2018.\n\nAccording to Talk of Fame Network\u2019s Rick Gosselin, NFL officials called and assessed 3,447 penalties over 17 weeks of games this year. Of note, first-year referees Shawn Hochuli and Shawn Smith finished in the top two spots of penalties assessed with a combined total of 481, Gosselin reports.\n\nNFL Penalty Tracker puts the full 2018 tally at 3,472 penalties assessed. That\u2019s not counting the 476 penalties declined or the 148 ones that offset, brining the grand total of penalties thrown to 4,069. Per NFL Penalty Tracker\u2019s numbers, that\u2019s 7.95 flags thrown per game.\n\nDespite the string of penalties the New England Patriots sustained at points this season, Bill Belichick\u2019s team actually finished favorably in terms of infractions this year. The Patriots were hit with 5.81 penalties per games this year (the fourth-fewest in the league), taking 93 penalties overall (fourth-most), per NFL Penalty Tracker.\n\nThat marks represents an improvement for the Patriots vs. the 2017 season, when they took 95 penalties over 16 games, the seventh-fewest in the NFL.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nick O'Malley", "Nomalley Masslive.Com"], "top_image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/5JDtwcqOQRbSWLIsQloFdizp70Y=/1280x0/filters:focal(3137x1944:3147x1934)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WALOJL7ECREV3ONQ6VHO4BC6QY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-02"}
