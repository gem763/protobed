Marco Rubio (R-FL) delivered a fiery response on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d regarding House Democrats\u2019 continued push to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nRubio acknowledged impeachment is a \u201cbig deal\u201d that is \u201ctraumatic\u201d for the country and said voters did not send their representatives to Washington, D.C. to focus on impeaching Trump like a \u201csignificant number of members of the House\u201d have tried doing since he was elected in 2016.\n\n\u201cI wonder how many of these House members were elected to do this,\u201d Rubio emphasized. \u201cBecause I assure you that they were elected, even the ones that ran in 2018 and got elected, the Democrats in the seats that Trump won. Nobody sent them up there to impeach Donald Trump. They sent them here to deal with drug prices, to deal with China, to help our economy continue to grow, to fund our military. They won\u2019t even pass, you know, an appropriations bill we need to get done which is important for long-term planning.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cVery few people, unless you come from the most radical fringes of the American political spectrum, were sent up here to spend all of their time, every single day focused on this issue. They\u2019re going to do what they\u2019re going to do. I can\u2019t control what the House does, but we\u2019re going to continue to do our job, or at least try to over here in the Senate.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Tuesday,\u00a0Sen.
