I would and do when someone enters into my home, and it's probably something that the products themselves should try to indicate,\" he said.\n\nNest devices are fitted with an LED light that turns on whenever they're in recording mode. These recordings can't be overridden in the moment, but users can reconfigure their Nest settings to disable all recordings (or simply unplug the devices). A Google spokesperson was not immediately available to respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nGoogle faced backlash from privacy advocates earlier this year when it admitted that its workers were listening to and transcribing some users' voice commands to Google Assistant. Google said the transcriptions were used to improve its voice-recognition technology and affected less than 1% of all audio snippets recorded.\n\nGoogle announced expanded Nest features at its annual devices expo Tuesday morning, including Nest Aware, a new cloud network that connects Nest devices. The feature will roll out in early 2020.\n\nHave a tip?
