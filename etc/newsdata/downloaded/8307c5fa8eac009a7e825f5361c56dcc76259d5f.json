That's why they've been at the forefront of AI research across the world.\n\nThe problem is, they've mostly been using it to subjugate and spy on their population.\n\nImages courtesy: Reuters\n\nWhich is why many governments have been wondering whether it's time to impose research restrictions on China when it comes to AI. But there's at least one expert who believes that's a bad idea, and that's Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nAs US-China trade relations sour, there have been whispers of the former enforcing the severing of research ties of all American companies with the latter. Which is a problem for Microsoft given that it's had R&D ties with China for decades. Additionally, according to the BBC, it does more research and development in China than even back home.\n\nIn an interview with the publication, Nadella admitted that there are indeed safety concerns with regards to AI in the hands of China. However, he insists that cutting off those research ties would do more harm than good to the rest of the world.\n\nDon't Miss 918 SHARES 1.6 K SHARES 735 SHARES\n\n\"A lot of AI research happens in the open, and the world benefits from knowledge being open,\" he said. \"That to me is been what's been true since the Renaissance and the scientific revolution. Therefore, I think, for us to say that we will put barriers on it may in fact hurt more than improve the situation everywhere.\"\n\nMicrosoft first opened an office in China under Bill Gates in 1992. Since then, it's Beijing headquarters has swelled to over 200 employed scientists and over 300 visiting researchers and students.\n\nEven more worrisome is that, according to reports back in April, Microsoft's AI researchers are also working with teams at China's National University of Defence Technology. Of course, human rights activists and machine learning experts worry this would lead to China further utilizing AI to oppress its minority populations, as it has done before.\n\nAnd Nadella isn't ignorant of this threat of course. \"We know any technology can be a tool or a weapon,\" he told the BBC. \"The question is, how do you ensure that these weapons don't get created?\"\n\n\"I think there are multiple mechanisms. The first thing is we, as creators, should start with having a set of ethical design principles to ensure that we're creating AI that's fair, that's secure, that's private, that's not biased.\"\n\nThe problem is, Nadella insists Microsoft has enough control over the possible controversial advancements in AI being made at their facility in China. He says the company has in fact turned down certain requests they felt were inappropriate, ethically.\n\n\"We do have control on who gets to use our technology. And we do have principles. Beyond how we build it, how people use it is something that we control through Terms of Use. And we are constantly evolving the terms of use,\" the CEO said.\n\n\"We also recognise whether it's in the United States, whether it's in China, whether it's in the United Kingdom, they will all have their own legislative processes on what they accept or don't accept, and we will abide by them.\"\n\nThat's all well and good, but it's an incredibly naive outlook, and Nadella probably knows this. China has proven in the past it's not above surveilling its own citizens, and outright harassing minority groups, dissidents, and activists.\n\nThe AI research going on may very well drastically move forward the AI machine. But we have to wonder whether it's worth the cost of China abusing it to the detriment of the people there. Not to mention, you have no idea how the country might decide to deploy that technology in its products distributed to the rest of the world too.", "description": "Artificial Intelligence can have a variety of uses and applications, something that China realises.
