REUTERS/Staff/File Photo\n\nRenault (RENA.PA) slumped 12.7% to lowest since 2013 after the company cut its full-year revenue and profit forecast amid a broad-based slump in auto sales.\n\nThe fall put the wider auto and auto parts index .SXAP on course for its biggest percentage drop in two-and-a-half weeks, and pulled the Paris .FCHI index down 0.2%, lagging its European peers.\n\nAdding to the gloom in the auto sector, Sweden\u2019s AB Volvo (VOLVb.ST) said demand for trucks would fall on both sides of the North Atlantic next year.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was marginally lower, eyeing its third day of losses, but still on pace to end a volatile week, dominated by Brexit headlines, modestly higher.\n\nBoris Johnson struck a Brexit deal with the European Union on Thursday, sending the benchmark index to its highest in more than a year, but concerns remain about the deal getting through the British parliament.\n\n\u201cEveryone is very tired of Brexit. People just want to get this done and look forward to other things, like negotiating a free trade deal,\u201d said Stefan Koopman, senior market economist at Rabobank.\n\nUncertainty about UK\u2019s orderly exit from the EU and other geopolitical tensions, combined with slowing global growth, have rankled financial markets this year.\n\nAfter a solid increase in the first quarter, gains in the STOXX 600 index have tapered off in the second and third. Fresh data on Friday showed China\u2019s economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter.\n\nInvestor focus now turns to the third-quarter earnings season, which kicks off in earnest next week. An earnings recession in Europe is expected to deepen in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nEarly earnings reports, however, were a mixed bag, with weak results from the defense and retail sectors, but a strong report from Swedish medical technology group Getinge (GETIb.ST). Its shares jumped 16.3% to the top of STOXX 600 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly core profit.\n\nThales (TCFP.PA), the largest European defense electronics company, dropped 3.5% after lowering its 2019 revenue growth forecast, while yogurt maker Danone (DANO.PA) tumbled 6.2% after narrowing its sales growth outlook for 2019.\n\nLondon Stock Exchange (LSE.L) rose 2.4% after reporting a higher-than-expected third-quarter income ahead of the planned shareholder vote on its deal to buy data provider Refinitiv.\n\nThe German .GDAXI index ticked higher, with help from Deutsche Post AG (DPWGn.DE) after Berenberg upgraded the stock to \"buy\", while gains in banks propped up Spanish .IBEX and Italian .FTMIB bourses.", "description": "French carmaker Renault dragged European shares lower on Friday, while the sharpest contraction in the Chinese economy in nearly three decades exacerbated worries about slowing global growth.", "authors": ["Medha Singh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442198103&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0JL", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
