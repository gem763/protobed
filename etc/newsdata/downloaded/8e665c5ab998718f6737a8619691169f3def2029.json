I had just spoken on the damages that over-functioning parenting styles can cause to kids. She had just heard the data on how today\u2019s parents often risk too little, rescue too quickly and rave too easily.\n\nFor the record, this new parenting style began decades ago when we decided to negotiate our children\u2019s grades in school; to do our kids\u2019 homework for them over a latte, and to give them trophies just for showing up.\n\nCOLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL: MARKETING CEO GETS 3 WEEKS FOR CHEATING ON SON'S ACT EXAM\n\nOver the years, it seems the helicopter parent has become an Apache helicopter.\n\nAs evidence, I submit to you this year\u2019s college admissions scandal \u2013 a conspiracy where parents paid bribes to insure their children got into their college of choice. More than 50 people have been charged in the scandal, accused of paying over $25 million between 2011 and 2018. False documents were submitted; SAT scores were adjusted and money was laundered.\n\nCelebrities involved in the scandal include \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, who have pleaded not guilty. Actress Felicity Huffman pleaded guilty and is currently serving a 14-day jail sentence and was ordered to also perform 250 hours of community service and pay a $30,000 fine.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI INDICTED ON NEW FEDERAL CHARGES IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL\n\nThe scandal is a case study of the leadership style too many parents of Generation Z children have embraced. These parents have decided to play a more intrusive role in the lives and futures of their children. While most parents may not stoop to illegal activity, they\u2019ve felt the need to prepare the path for the child instead of the child for the path.\n\nI began wondering how this kind of leadership style has impacted our kids.\n\nOur non-profit, Growing Leaders, and the Harris Poll surveyed more than 2,000 adults across America, from a variety of demographics to find out how they felt about Generation Z, the youngest population growing up today.\n\nWhat we discovered confirmed my hunch. Some 66 percent of American adults have a negative emotion first when they think of kids today.\n\nIn other words, the first thing we feel is pessimism, not optimism. Before belief we feel frustration. Before hope we feel fear for them. And 64 percent of us do not believe today\u2019s kids will be ready for adulthood in time.\n\nThis fear narrative drives us to be intrusive, especially when we feel our kid won\u2019t be able to negotiate life for themselves. It even leads some parents to cheat to get their kids into college. And it\u2019s had a negative net effect on how teenagers approach life.\n\nAs I reviewed how we got here, I discovered the research from Dr. Julian Rotter in 1954. Rotter created a scale to determine whether students were developing an \u201cexternal locus of control\u201d or an \u201cinternal locus of control.\u201d Simply defined, here is the difference:\n\nInternal Locus of Control \u2013 People who believe that they are responsible and in control of their own success.\n\nExternal Locus of Control \u2013 People who believe that fate or external forces somehow determine their success.\n\nAfter nine years of study, Rotter\u2019s conclusions were that students with an \u201cinternal locus\u201d became far more successful in life, taking better care of their health, careers and families. It makes sense. They believe they\u2019re responsible for the outcomes.\n\nAs I reviewed the last five decades, I saw a steady rise in \u201cexternal locus of control\u201d among students.\n\nSince 2002, U.S. kids have experienced a steep rise in this \u201cexternal locus.\u201d More of them feel their lives are out of their control.\n\nDr. Peter Gray, of Boston College, writes: \u201cIn fact, the shift has been so great that the average young person in 2002 was more External than were 80% of young people in the 1960s. The rise in Externality on Rotter\u2019s scale over the 42-year period showed the same linear trend as did the rise in depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nReflect for a moment. In \u201cGeneration Z Unfiltered,\u201d I pose the question: How do you suppose feeling \u201cout of control of my life\u201d affects a teen? Don\u2019t you feel a little more anxious when someone else is in control of your life?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhen kids enter their teenage years, their brains are developing significantly, desiring to take more risks; they naturally yearn for more autonomy and responsibility. It\u2019s how we all get ready for healthy adulthood.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t equip our children to take on that independence, life gets unhealthy. We must begin to offer our kids a greater sense of ownership by believing in them and their ability to achieve on their own.\n\nWhen Felicity Huffman was sentenced for her part in the college admissions scandal, she said she felt ashamed and embarrassed. Yet, in an interview she confessed that her sentencing wasn\u2019t the worst part of the ordeal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHuffman said the worst part was facing her daughter, who said with tears in her eyes: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you believe in me? Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own?\u201d\n\nMay we never have a teen say those words to any of us.", "description": "When we don\u2019t equip our children to take on independence as they grow older, life gets unhealthy.
