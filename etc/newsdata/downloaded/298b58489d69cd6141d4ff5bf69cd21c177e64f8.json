Taking off four days from May 4 (Star Wars day) will see you off work for nine days between May 2-10.\n\nThe second bank holiday will be on May 25, so booking off between May 26 and 29 will get you another nine consecutive days away and by June your colleagues will start forgetting you work there at all.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nFancy another nine days? Here you go. With the August bank holiday on Monday 31, you just need to book off between September 1-4 and you can lap up some late summer rays or, more likely, escape the rain.\n\nSaving the best until last, seven holiday days over the festive period will give you 16 days straight of Christmas jumpers and pigs in blankets for breakfast.\n\nWe'll be off Christmas day on Friday, December 25 and, with Boxing Day falling on a weekend, we'll get Monday, December 28 in lieu.\n\nWith New Year's Day on a Friday, booking off December 21-24 and 29-31 will see you away for the entirety of the most wonderful time of the year.\n\nFollow the guide and you'll pretty much be working part time next year.", "description": "Planning your annual leave in advance can maximise your time out of the office next year", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18331244.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Woman-reading-a-book-on-the-beach.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
