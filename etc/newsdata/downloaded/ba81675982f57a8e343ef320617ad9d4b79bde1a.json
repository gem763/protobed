If are going to the White House, surely this is a good step forward.'\n\nThe teenager's mother said she was trying not to get her hopes up.\n\n'We are keeping our fingers crossed that we're not going to go and have a 'there-there' pat on the back, but of course I'm pleased,' she said.\n\n'I just don't know what to expect and we keep our fingers crossed that it's not just an invitation to have a general chat.'\n\nTrump last week called it 'a terrible accident' and said he planned to intervene and potentially arrange a meeting between the Dunns and Sacoolas.\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, was killed in August when his motorcycle collided with a car allegedly driven by Anne Sacoolas outside a British air force base in Northamptonshire\n\nDunn's parents announced the White House meeting on a 'Justice4Harry' crowd-funding page.\n\nA senior U.S. official, speaking on background, confirmed the plan.\n\nThe family said they hoped the invitation represented 'a positive development in our fight for justice'.\n\n'We believe this can only be achieved if Anne Sacoolas returns to England and engages properly with the justice system, where she will be treated fairly in a proper investigation of what happened to our son on that day,' they said.\n\nDunn's parents are expected to meet with reporters outside the White House after the late-afternoon meeting.\n\nSacoolas's lawyer, Amy Jeffress, told the BBC earlier that her client was 'devastated' by the accident and wanted to meet with the parents to 'express her deepest sympathies'.", "description": "Harry Dunn, aged 19, died on August 27 in a head-on collision between his motorcycle and a car being driven on the wrong side of the road by a US diplomat's wife in Northamptonshire, UK.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/23/19762236-0-image-a-23_1571179172491.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
