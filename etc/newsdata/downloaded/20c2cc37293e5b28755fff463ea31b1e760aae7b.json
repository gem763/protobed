Ultimately, it comes down to the flow of the game. The laws are the laws but each referee has their own interpretation.\n\nEngland will concentrate on themselves first and foremost. Then they will want to be acutely aware of what South Africa are going to do but the third question is: \u2018Who is the referee?\u2019\n\nThe front row will look at scrummaging tendencies. Some referees are slower, some like to have it nice and steady, some want the ball played away quickly.\n\nGarces is relaxed on the pitch, and will reward the superior scrum if there is dominance\n\nWith French referees, if you show a perceived dominance then they give you some reward.\n\nThat should be no different with Garces.\n\nIf you\u2019re bigger, heavier and going forwards, that plants a seed in the ref\u2019s head and the mauls and breakdowns start going your way.\n\nWhat has been good at this World Cup is the lack of interference by the assistant referees.\n\nA lot of decisions have been made on the run and that lets the game flow.", "description": "DYLAN HARTLEY: Like most French referees, Jerome Garces is quite relaxed on the pitch.
