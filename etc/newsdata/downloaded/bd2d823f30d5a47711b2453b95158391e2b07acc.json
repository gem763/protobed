A new brush fire erupted on Wednesday morning in nearby Simi Valley in Ventura County, prompting officials to order mandatory evacuations in the suburbs around the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service issued an \"extreme red flag\" warning for wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.\n\n\"I don't know if I've ever seen us use this warning,\" said forecaster Marc Chenard. \"It's pretty bad.\"\n\nStatewide, the weather service issued warnings of dangerous fire weather conditions covering more than 88,000 square km, encompassing some 21 million people. Scientists have linked an increase in frequency and intensity of wildfires to climate change.\n\nFire officials are worried that strong winds will whip up embers like these in Calistoga, Calif. (Noah Berger/The Associated Press)\n\nThe Santa Ana winds are a regional weather phenomenon that sends gusts westward off the desert out to the Southern California coast. They are forecast to reach sustained speeds of 80 to 110 km/h on Wednesday and Thursday, raising the risk of sparks and embers being whipped into fresh wildfires in unburned areas.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said extremely high winds could also force the grounding of water-dropping helicopters, a vital component of the firefighting arsenal.\n\nCity arson investigators say the Getty fire was likely caused by a broken tree branch being blown into power lines during high winds on Monday morning.\n\nElectricity remained cut off to roughly half a million homes and businesses in Northern and Central California on Tuesday as a precaution by the state's largest utility.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has accused utilities of failing to adequately modernize and safely maintain their power systems.\n\nGaining ground\n\nAn army of some 1,100 firefighters battled the Getty fire Tuesday in a narrow window of slower winds. By early Wednesday, crews had managed to contain about 15 per cent of the blaze.\n\nIn Northern California, where firefighters struggled for a sixth day against a 30,760-hectare blaze in Sonoma County's winemaking region, high-wind forecasts prompted Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) to impose a new round of blackouts for nearly 600,000 homes and businesses.\n\nWATCH: See what one part of California looked like Tuesday after the Kincade fire hit\n\nThe largest of the wildfires burning in California is the Kincade Fire, which has displaced thousands of people. The National is on the ground in Northern California to view the devastation first hand with some residents. 2:16\n\nThat included about 400,000 customers blacked out in a power shutoff that PG&E instituted days earlier, the company said.\n\nEarly Wednesday, PG&E announced that it had restored about 73 percent of the 970,000 or so customers affected in earlier shutoffs.\n\nUtilities serving Southern California's more highly urbanized areas have imposed smaller-scale outages.\n\nPG&E has been implicated in the Sonoma County blaze, dubbed the Kincade fire. The utility acknowledged last week that the Kincade fire broke out near a damaged PG&E transmission tower at about the time a live high-voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned.\n\nCrews have made some progress in their fight to contain the Getty Fire, seen here on Monday.

At least a dozen homes have been destroyed so far.\n\nWATCH: See some of the damage caused by the Getty Fire", "description": "Extraordinarily dry, prolonged Santa Ana winds are predicted to gust through Southern California on Wednesday, prompting strong warnings from meteorologists as residents contend with damaging wildfires.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340949.1572448277!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1178976371.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
