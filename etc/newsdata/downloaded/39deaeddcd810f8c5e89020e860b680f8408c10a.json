Would we rather bring someone in who is going to turn it upside down? I wouldn\u2019t because it\u2019s going to make my job much harder,\u2019 Giles hit back.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a good man with solid values and I\u2019m pleased the right man is English because it helps break that cycle we were in where we couldn\u2019t employ an English coach - and I think we\u2019ve got a good one here.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s certainly a steeliness to him that I don\u2019t think you particularly want to cross as a player. I think the hairdryer treatment is a bit dated but one of the things that\u2019s impressed me about him, from what I\u2019ve seen and the people I\u2019ve spoken to, is the way he manages people. I think it bodes well.\u2019\n\nGiles says there is a 'steeliness' to Silverwood's character that will serve him well in the job\n\nNevertheless, Giles added: \u2018Yes, It took me a couple of long days and sleepless nights but that\u2019s the way it should be. It\u2019s a big job and we take these decisions very seriously.\u2019\n\nSilverwood, referred to by Giles as \u2018Hannibal\u2019, will have at least two Englishmen as assistant coaches in Graham Thorpe and Paul Collingwood. That pair, and an as-yet-to-be-identified third deputy - a pace-bowling specialist - might on occasion be asked to front the team for series or groups of matches to allow the head coach to take breaks within a saturated international schedule.\n\nAdditionally, although Saqlain Mushtaq\u2019s 100-day-a-year contract is not being renewed, there will be scope to draft in coaching consultants on an hoc basis. For example, a spin bowling expert is likely to be acquired for the two-match Test series in Sri Lanka next spring.\n\nMeanwhile, Giles revealed he had spoken to both Ben and Clare Stokes in the aftermath of pictures emerging from last week\u2019s PCA dinner in which the England all-rounder\u2019s left hand was up against his wife\u2019s face.\n\n\u2018I think we can all say domestic violence is a really serious issue, we\u2019re not making light of that at all. But in this instance it\u2019s a very happy couple having some fun and a picture telling a thousand words, but just the wrong ones,\u2019 Giles said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a worry in some sense how his profile can be used against him, how susceptible they are as a family to this. The bigger your profile the more difficult it can become.\u2019", "description": "Ashley Giles admits the process of appointing a new England coach gave him sleepless nights and took a 'long couple of days' but is pleased the man he identified as best for the job is English.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19601560-0-image-a-20_1570816630076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
