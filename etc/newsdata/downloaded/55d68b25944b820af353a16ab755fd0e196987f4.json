CenturyLink stock (ticker: CTL) is down 16% year to date and off 40% in the latest 12 months, making it one of the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019. The company has seen a number of setbacks including executive turnover, delays in regulatory filings, a string of poor earnings, and the consequences of having to reduce its dividend. This comes as the whole wireline industry has faced shriveling sales and grappled with high debt loads.\n\nStill, CenturyLink has fared better than some, as it continues to make investments in its business, and insiders have bought stock. Some analysts think the selloff has gone too far, but most remain hesitant to recommend the shares, even as they\u2019ve recovered from some of the worst of their declines, on hopes that some business trends were turning in CenturyLink\u2019s favor.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nWhat\u2019s new. On Friday, Guggenheim analyst Mike McCormack reiterated a Neutral rating and $10 price target on CenturyLink stock. \u201cAlthough hopes for the macro environment for wireline business services perked up over the Summer, recent commentary and our checks indicate that nothing has really changed,\u201d he writes.\n\nMcCormack argues that the shift from more lucrative legacy technologies to newer alternatives, along with the general pricing environment, will continue to weigh on CenturyLink, as well as peers.\n\nLooking ahead. He does think that certain segments of the business, including enterprise, will be higher in the second half of the year that they were to start in 2019, but he warns that this doesn\u2019t reflect \u201can underlying change to the fundamentals,\u201d especially as its small business and consumer divisions will likely remain pressured.\n\nMcCormack was the first analyst to downgrade CenturyLink to Sell this year, back in January, although he\u2019s since turned less bearish, including his upgrade to Neutral in May. So his latest note continues that string of caution and advice to remain on the sidelines.\n\nCenturyLink is up 1.2% to $12.69 in recent trading.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "Shares of the embattled wireline provider are higher on Friday, but Guggenheim warns that headwinds remain.
