Their traditional rivals, the conservative People\u2019s Party, stand to gain the most from fresh elections, rising to 20.1% from 16.7%. Ciudadanos would plunge to 10.7% from 15.9% while Podemos would fall to 12%, the survey found.\n\nSpain is set for elections on Nov. 10 after acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez failed to secure enough support in parliament to form a new government. He won April\u2019s vote but fell well short of an overall majority, and his effort to form an alliance with anti-austerity group Podemos ultimately failed due to disagreements over ministerial posts. The new elections will be the fourth Spain holds in as many years.\n\nThe nationwide poll of 1,277 computer-assisted telephone interviews was carried out Oct. 1-3 and has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Charlie Devereux in Madrid at cdevereux3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net, Jana Randow, Pete Norman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Spain\u2019s Socialists would once more be the most voted party in an electoral rerun but would still fall short of a majority, according to an IMOP Insights poll published by El Confidencial.The Socialists have almost exactly the same support they garnered in April\u2019s vote, with the survey", "authors": ["Charlie Devereux"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
