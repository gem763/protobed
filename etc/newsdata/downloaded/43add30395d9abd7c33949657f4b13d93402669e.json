It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how deeply into Syria they would seek to advance, the officials said.\n\nRegardless of its scope, the plan is fraught with risks.\n\nFinanced, trained and armed by the U.S. to combat Islamic State, Syrian Kurdish forces have vowed to defend their territorial hold, including large border towns such as Kobani, raising fears of violent urban warfare and substantial civilian casualties. There is also a risk that the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which Ankara says is aligned with Syrian Kurdish forces, will intensify its own insurgency inside Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe face threats from multiple fronts,\u201d said Engin Ozkoc, a Turkish lawmaker affiliated with the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party.\n\nRelated Video American troops began withdrawing from the Syria-Turkey border, marking a major shift in U.S. policy as Washington pulls back from a key partner in the fight against Islamic State\u2014the Kurds\u2014ahead of a Turkish offensive against them.

That decision have worried officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of which Turkey is a member, seeing it as a step that will push Ankara more firmly within Russia\u2019s orbit.\n\nA fighter with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces standing on Monday at a post where U.S. troops were based near the Turkish border in Tel Abyad, Syria.

And Russia has maintained good relations with the Syrian Kurdish forces and their political wing, providing them with occasional support and allowing them to have a representative office in Moscow.\n\nYasar Yakis, a retired Turkish diplomat who held several posts in the Middle East, including in Damascus, said Turkey should be wary of having to deal face-to-face with Russia in Syria.\n\n\u201cLike the Americans, the Russians will want to hold the Kurdish card in their hands,\u201d Mr. Yakis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful lever to keep Turkey\u2019s ambitions in check.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish issue became a source of tension between Ankara and Washington in 2014 when the U.S. shifted tack in the Syrian conflict, steering away from supporting rebels against the Assad regime and bonding with Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. That military cooperation became a source of exasperation for Turkey late last year, when President Trump declared Islamic State defeated.\n\nMr. Erdogan spent the following months urging Washington to part ways with its Kurdish allies and instead pair up with Turkey to create a buffer zone stretching from the Euphrates River to the Iraqi border that would be free of any armed Kurd.\n\nIn Washington, the request largely fell on deaf ears, in part because the Pentagon said it needed more time to eradicate remaining Islamic State threats, and because Turkey and the U.S. were sparring over the S-400 issue.\n\nIn August, nonetheless, the two countries began formal discussions on how to find a compromise in northeastern Syria.\n\nBy then, Mr. Erdogan was battling with falling approval ratings, which pollsters attribute to growing resentment among Turks over the presence of Syrian refugees in Turkey. In addition to repelling Kurdish militias away from its border, Turkey said it wanted to seize control of an 18-mile wide strip on inside Syria to relocate about half of the nearly four million Syrian refugees living in Turkey.\n\nIn September, Mr. Erdogan used his address during the United Nations General Assembly in New York to herald an even bigger plan. Brandishing a map of northeastern Syria, he proposed spearheading an effort to relocate three million Syrian refugees, including some from Europe, in the area. Turkey\u2019s national housing agency followed with presentation of a $27 billion project to erect entire cities on the Syrian side of the border.\n\nThe plan has drawn only halfhearted support from the U.S., according to Turkish officials.\n\n\u201cWe are really sincere about creating this \u2018safe zone\u2019,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week. \u201cBut we do not see the same sincerity on the U.S. side.\u201d\n\nWestern diplomats say the Turkish idea of sending millions of Syrians back home isn\u2019t realistic in its current form. They say the U.S. and the European Union could hardly support building cities in a complete legal vacuum, since most land owners have been displaced by war. They also warn against the risk of altering Syria\u2019s ethnic fabric by sending refugees to regions different from their province of origin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d one Western diplomat said.\n\n\u2014Thomas Grove in Moscow contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to David Gauthier-Villars at David.Gauthier-Villars@wsj.com", "description": "Turkey\u2019s decision to launch a military offensive in northeastern Syria opens a new front in the eight-year Syrian conflict, testing the country\u2019s influence in a volatile region where the U.S. wants a diminished role and Russia a bigger one.", "authors": ["David Gauthier-Villars", "David.Gauthier-Villars Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-114434/social", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
