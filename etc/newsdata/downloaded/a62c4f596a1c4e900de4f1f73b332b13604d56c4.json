Weir said the library is fortified to withstand wildfires and firefighters were working hard to prevent it from reaching the building.\n\nWinds reached up to 60 miles per hour, further helping to spread the flames.\n\n\"But to give you a sense of the scope of the problem if California, Governor [Gavin] Newsom campaigned...to put $10 billion of public money into a big pot to help these publicly or investor-owned companies utilities, these for profit companies, bail out of bankruptcy because of all of the liability that comes from these fires,\" Weir said.\n\n\"They need to fortify something like 7,000 miles of vulnerable power lines in the state. This year they managed 100 miles,\" he added.\n\nCBS Los Angeles reported the Easy Fire had grown to 1,300 acres and was threatened around 7,000 homes.\n\nThe fire outflanked us very rapidly today, pushed by those 40 to 50 mile per hour winds,\u201d Ventura County Fire Assistant Chief Chad Cook said. \u201cWe did up to 65 miles per hour this morning, which made long-range spotting very, very dangerous and also quickly outpaced the initial attack resources.\u201d\n\nThe state has mobilized their National Guard units to assist the firefighters and the evacuations. Pennsylvania National Guardsmen with the 870th Military Police Company are also in the state to help direct traffic.", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:17:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/303/e629a192-1bbd-4b5e-9c8a-05aa09622706.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
