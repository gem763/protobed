I can't even\u2026 just as a mother\u2026 I can't. I have no words. I very rarely have no words,\" she added.\n\nHussain, who grew up in a Bangladeshi community in Luton, also discusses being a victim of bullying at school in her memoir.\n\nShe writes how a boy in her class exposed himself to her, before calling her a \"black bitch\" and repeatedly slamming her hand in a door.\n\nIn another incident boys forced her head into a toilet - a memory that has left her with persistent flashbacks.\n\nShe writes about how she tried to kill herself at the age of 10.\n\n\"I didn't know what death was. All I knew was that it meant not living the life I had now - and I didn't like my life,\" she writes.\n\nBut she changed her mind after her parents announced her mother was pregnant with her brother, Shak.\n\n\"I can't go anywhere, I have to stay for him. He will need me,\" she writes.\n\nEarlier this year, Hussain opened up about the bullying in BBC One documentary Nadiya: Anxiety and Me.\n\n\"I still have that memory of the water going up my nose and feeling like if they don't pull me up now I am going to drown with my head in this toilet,\" she said.\n\nViewers praised her for allowing cameras to follow her as she sought diagnosis and treatment for \"extreme anxiety\".\n\nShe spoke about her constant struggle with a panic disorder, which she described as a \"monster\", in 2017, two years after she won the Great British Bake Off.\n\nInformation and advice\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with issues raised by this story, find support through BBC Action Line.", "description": "The Bake Off winner says the trauma she experienced as a five year old played a role in her PTSD.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/06BA/production/_109122710_hi054590269.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
