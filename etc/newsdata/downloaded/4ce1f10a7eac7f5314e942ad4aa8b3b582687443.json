Got a question for her? Email askaboss@nymag.com. Photo: The Cut\n\nDear Boss,\n\nI share my office with a woman I\u2019ll call Katie. We generally get along, but she is an awful office mate.\n\nDespite having a desk phone with a headset, she inexplicably takes her conference calls on speakerphone. When I have nicely asked her to switch phones or quiet down, she\u2019ll put her hand up to quiet me. Then, once she\u2019s off the phone, she\u2019ll claim that it\u2019s easier to speak on her cell phone, even though she doesn\u2019t have a Bluetooth for that.\n\nI wish I could say that\u2019s the worst of it. It\u2019s not. She also has arguments with her husband at least once or twice a week, sometimes more, and they get pretty personal and heated.\n\nI\u2019m in a role where I\u2019m basically tethered to my desk all day and my boss is not keen on me leaving to do my work elsewhere. My work is confidential, so it\u2019s not like I can go to a caf\u00e9 or other public space. In order to deal with this, when she\u2019s in the office, I have my headphones on with the music cranked up. The other day, when she was having another loud argument with her husband, I needed to speak with a colleague about a project. I had to message him that I\u2019d have to wait until Katie was done arguing with her husband before I could call him back.\n\nThe other thing complicating this is that Katie is highly emotional. After some of these calls she will sit at her desk and cry. I get that life is happening while we\u2019re working, and sometimes things happen in our personal lives that spill over into our professional environments. That\u2019s fine. But this is happening way too frequently to be normal.\n\nI\u2019ve lost patience with her behavior. I need to figure out how to shut this down, and I want to try to work it out with her before going to our boss. (Also, what would I say to my boss? \u201cShe\u2019s incredibly disruptive and awful to share an office with, please move one of us ASAP \u2026 No, I didn\u2019t talk to her about it first.\u201d) I want to be sensitive to her stressful situation at home, but also make it clear that she needs to stop this behavior. Any suggestions?\n\nUgh, this sounds really uncomfortable! Having your office mate openly fight with her husband and then cry about it while you\u2019re trying to carry on with your work is genuinely disruptive. As sympathetic as you might be, most people would struggle to remain undistracted by that.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound callous. Clearly Katie is under a lot of stress, and I\u2019m sure this is no picnic for her. But when you share work space with someone, you have to be thoughtful about how much of your personal life affects them \u2014 and it\u2019s not okay to regularly subject your office mate to your marital fights.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly odd is that it doesn\u2019t sound like Katie is taking even basic steps to be a courteous office mate (or to protect her own privacy, for that matter). Presumably, she could step out of your shared office to have some of these personal calls in private! But she\u2019s also taking conference calls on speakerphone (which should really be a felony), and has refused to stop when you\u2019ve asked her to. So I\u2019m thinking Katie is \u2026 not especially in tune with how what she does affects others?\n\n(That said, I wonder if you\u2019ve been assertive enough. When she told you it\u2019s \u201ceasier\u201d for her to take calls on speakerphone, did you push back at all? Ideally you would have said something like, \u201cI understand you prefer it, but I really can\u2019t concentrate while you\u2019re doing it. I need to be able to work, so I just don\u2019t think we can use speakerphone while the other is here.\u201d)\n\nAs for what to do about the disruptive personal calls, you\u2019re right that if you talk to your boss, the first thing she\u2019ll probably ask is whether you\u2019ve spoken to Katie directly. It\u2019s smart to try to address it with Katie now so that if you do need to escalate it to your boss, you\u2019ll be able to say you\u2019ve tried that.\n\nNormally when you want to ask someone to keep their noise level down, it\u2019s easiest to do it when they\u2019re actually making noise, or immediately after. That way it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve been stewing over it for days. But because we\u2019re talking about marital fights here, it could feel unkind if you ask her to quiet down while she\u2019s obviously upset and emotional. Instead, I think you\u2019ll have better luck if you wait for a calmer moment (not on the same day as one of the fights) and say something like, \u201cI know you\u2019ve been having to take a lot of personal calls lately, and some of them can get loud. It sounds like you\u2019re having a tough time and I don\u2019t want to make things harder on you, but realistically it\u2019s hard for me to stay focused on work when that\u2019s happening. I\u2019m sorry to ask, but if a call is getting heated, would you be able to step into a conference room instead?\u201d\n\nOr, if you\u2019d rather be more casual, you could say: \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry to ask, but I can\u2019t focus when you\u2019re arguing with Mark. Can you step out into a conference room if you\u2019re on a call with him?\u201d\n\nGiven that she\u2019s refused your request to stop taking other calls on speakerphone, it\u2019s possible she won\u2019t acquiesce here either. But even if she doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll be in a better position to talk to your manager about the situation because you\u2019ll be able to answer \u201cHave you talked to her about this directly?\u201d with \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nIf it does become necessary to talk to your boss, try framing it as \u201cCan you help me find a solution to this?\u201d For example, you could say, \u201cI\u2019m hoping to get your advice on something. I\u2019m finding it difficult to focus in my office with Katie. She has loud arguments with her husband on the phone in our office a couple of times a week, and is visibly upset afterward. I\u2019m sympathetic, of course, but it\u2019s making it hard to focus, even with headphones. Last week I had to reschedule a call because I couldn\u2019t speak with the person while she was having a loud argument next to me. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a way to move one of us to a different space. Alternately, would you be open to me working from a conference room when this is going on?\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019ve alerted your boss to what\u2019s happening, but you\u2019re not complaining. You\u2019re asking for help finding a solution.\n\nA good manager will hear this and intervene in some way. Maybe it\u2019s moving one of you, maybe it\u2019s giving you more flexibility on where you work from, or maybe it\u2019s talking to Katie about what\u2019s going on \u2014 but she should do something other than tell you to just live with it.\n\nOf course, if she\u2019s not a good manager \u2014 if she\u2019s overly passive or simply negligent \u2014 then she might leave it to you to handle and you\u2019ll end up back with your headphones. But even then you might still feel better knowing that you\u2019ve confronted the situation directly.\n\nGet Ask a Boss delivered every week Email Terms & Privacy Notice By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\nOrder Alison Green\u2019s book Ask a Manager: Clueless Colleagues, Lunch-Stealing Bosses, and the Rest of Your Life at Work here.
