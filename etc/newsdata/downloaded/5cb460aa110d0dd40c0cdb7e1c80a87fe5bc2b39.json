Other key aspects of the report included the observations that the resident of the apartment where the blaze began was not at fault, and that the structural use of cladding caused the fire\u2019s spread.\n\nLondon\u2019s fire commissioner, Dany Cotton, defended the emergency services\u2019 response, saying they were dealing with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d situation and were \u201cdisappointed at some of the criticism\u201d levelled at individual staff.\n\n(MORE: Three billboards in London ask hard questions about Grenfell tower fire)\n\nPHOTO: A huge fire engulfs the 24 story Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, West London in the early hours of this morning in this June 14, 2017 file photo in London.

Justice means different things for all of us but the truth needs to be at the heart of our collective healing\u2026. Today\u2019s findings give some confidence that our journey towards truth has finally begun.\u201d\n\n(MORE: 5 men arrested for burning effigy of Grenfell Tower)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that \u201cno apology will ever make good the loss suffered,\u201d although he hoped it would \u201cbring some measure of comfort to those who suffered so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe promised them the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe them the truth.
