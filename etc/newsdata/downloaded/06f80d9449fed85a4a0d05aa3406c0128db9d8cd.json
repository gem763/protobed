It's happening here and now, affecting the special places we care for.\n\n\"We've seen overheating at some National Trust places in the South East, pests and diseases harming ash trees, and landslides and flooding at many sites.\n\n\"It's easy to feel helpless in the face of climate change, but by taking small steps, such as installing a smart meter, we can make a meaningful difference together.", "description": "The National Trust is to use augmented reality headsets to show visitors how climate change will affect their properties and grounds in the next 30 years.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Emily Hill", "Nigel Farage", "John Longworth"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/25/1220602_PA_HERITAGE-Monopoly-112215-Hardwick-Hall-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYomg1LzXaFubKVfAqrenmF4WH7-OF8AauUE3HFJD61Q.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
