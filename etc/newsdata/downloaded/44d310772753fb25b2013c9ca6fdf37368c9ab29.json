This week, lawyers, doctors, nurses, airline pilots and flight attendants poured onto the streets of the capital. On Saturday and on Tuesday, two of the largest trade union federations will march behind banners accusing Macron of dismantling the French way of life.\n\nThe Big Bang pension reform, promised by Macron during the 2017 election, is a huge gamble \u2014 an attempt to reduce France\u2019s jumble of 42 different state pension systems to one. The last president to try anything so daring was Jacques Chirac in 1995. He was forced to retreat in confusion and lost a parliamentary election 18 months later.\n\nDesigned to address one of the most crippling structural problems in the French economy, the reform is likely to be good economics in the long run. The short term looks far less appealing. It won\u2019t take full effect for six years, meaning that while it\u2019s likely to annoy almost anyone, it won\u2019t provide any benefits before the 2022 presidential election (or even the one after that).\n\nIn other words, it is just the kind of essential but unrewarding reform that prudent politicians avoid. French politicians in particular have been avoiding measures like this one for decades.\n\nMacron argues that pension reform is the only way to persuade the French to work longer.\n\nMacron\u2019s gamble is based on a different political calculation. The pension reform will be \u2014 after the labor market and other reforms pushed through in his first year \u2014 the final large piece in his plan to rescue France from itself. The French president will never be able to seize the de facto leadership of the European Union and demand the changes he wants unless he is also seen to attack the core problems at home.\n\nBut why pension reform? Why now?\n\nThough by far the most radical, Macron\u2019s would be the country\u2019s sixth pension reform in 26 years. After five partial or sticking-plaster reforms carried out since 1993, France\u2019s state pension system is still losing money but not disastrously so. The present system, actually a jumble of 42 systems, is more or less sustainable.\n\nThe problem is that it is also opaque, perverse and often unfair. In theory, everyone retires at 62. In reality, the average real retirement age is 63, but that number masks a host of disparities. The average age for men is just over 60. Some people, mostly women with fragmented careers, have to work until they are 67.\n\nOld sweetheart arrangements for some state employees \u2014 de facto subsidized by other workers \u2014 mean that railway drivers can retire at 50 and most metro workers at 55.\n\nMacron argues that pension reform is the only way to persuade the French to work longer. The country, taken as a whole, works less than any other industrialized country (630 hours a year for every man, woman and child, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, compared with 722 hours in Germany, 747 hours in the U.K. and 826 hours in the U.S).\n\nThe reasons for this include high unemployment, long studies, long holidays and the 35-hour working week (though its effect is sometimes exaggerated). But the single most important factor is early retirement, especially among men.\n\nIndeed, being retired in France can be an attractive proposition. State pensions in France vary but can be generous. They are based on the last six months\u2019 earnings for state employees and an average of 20 years\u2019 best earnings for executives in the private sector. French retirees receive average state pensions of 61 percent of their final earnings, according to the OECD. This is less than Italy (83 percent) but far more than Germany (38 percent) and the U.K. (29 percent).\n\nTo spare left-wing sensibilities, Macron promised in 2017 that he would not touch France\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d retirement age, already increased by his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy from 60 to 62 in 2010. Instead a draft plan presented in July seeks to increase the \u201creal\u201d retirement age, by stealth or by incentive, as part of a much bigger reform.\n\nThe details are up for discussion with unions and employers. A draft law is expected next spring. Its basic idea will be to boost pensions for those who agree to work longer, and reduce them for those who choose to retire early.\n\nMacron has defied one of the iron rules of politics: Do nothing that will benefit the country in the long run if it angers voters today.\n\nPulling this off will be a challenge. There are 42 existing regimes (10 for the state railway, the SNCF, alone). Macron wants to replace them with one state system, based on personal \u201cpoints\u201d acquired during a working lifetime. He says this would be fairer and make life easier for people who change jobs. Only the best-paid civil servants and executives would lose out. Any problems will be ironed out in negotiations before the draft law is presented.\n\nThis is disingenuous. There will inevitably be many losers (as well as many gainers) from the Macron scheme. Nurses, for example, have already pointed out that their pension regime has a \u20ac3 billion surplus; the lawyers\u2019 fund is \u20ac2 billion in the black. Other funds, such as those for Metro workers, are chronically loss-making. Teachers, poorly paid early in their careers, say that they would lose out if their pensions are decided by lifetime \u201cpoints\u201d rather than \u201cfinal salary.\u201d\n\nThe attacks have already begun. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen and politicians of the hard left are already misrepresenting the reform as an attack on all pensions. There\u2019s also the risk that the various demonstrations and strikes could merge with other social grumbles, including the rump of the Yellow Jacket movement, to destabilize Act II of the Macron presidency.\n\nAnd yet, Macron has reason to be hopeful. His opinion poll ratings are climbing to the high 30s and low 40s (historically high for a French mid-term president). The biggest and most moderate trade union federation, the CFDT, broadly supports the reforms. Other trade unions have failed to agree on a common front against them.\n\nMacron has defied one of the iron rules of politics: Do nothing that will benefit the country in the long run if it angers voters today. He may yet get away with it.\n\nJohn Lichfield is a former foreign editor of the Independent and was the newspaper\u2019s Paris correspondent for 20 years.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Mobility.
