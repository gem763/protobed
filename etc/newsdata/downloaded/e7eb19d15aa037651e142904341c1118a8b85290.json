Freight rates for supertankers across the globe to ship oil, particularly to Asia, <TD-LPP-SIN> have surged as a result.\n\nLast week Phillips 66 provisionally chartered the VLCC Syfnos to ship U.S. crude to China, two sources said. The company had also chartered the Landbridge Glory to ship U.S. crude to South Korea in early November for $10.4 million, according to a source and Refinitiv shipping data.\n\nThe Syfnos fixture has since failed, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the Landbridge Glory had failed but it was no longer a reported as a fixture on Refinitiv Eikon's database.\n\nU.S. crude exports have surged since a decades-long ban was lifted in late 2015. The exports rose to an average 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
