It looked like a game about moving blocks around, and I figured it was just about grabbing things from one place and bringing them to another. After spending some time with it, I\u2019ve learned what makes it so unique and compelling. Wilmot\u2019s Warehouse isn\u2019t about overcoming problems a designer has set for you, but solving the problem of your own brain.\n\nIn Wilmot\u2019s Warehouse, you play as a block who works in a warehouse. At the start of a turn, a pallet of objects gets delivered to the bottom of the screen, and you have about three minutes to sort them against pillars.\n\nThese objects are sometimes recognisable: toothbrushes, food, reading glasses. Others are brightly coloured shapes or are vaguely reminiscent of buildings or pills. Once the sorting timer is up, four customers appear at the top of the screen, demanding objects that you have a minute and a half to bring to them.\n\nYou can just drag all the objects close to the delivery zone if you want, but things are more manageable if you organise them against the pillars into categories. You can organise items however you want, but more items get added between turns. Whatever categories you come up with quickly start to expand.\n\nSome items could go in multiple categories, while others introduce new categories altogether. You have to make snap decisions to sort objects, and then remember both what you called them and where you put them.\n\nThings started off fine for me this afternoon. I dubbed a category \u201cmouth stuff\u201d and filled it with toothbrushes, pills, and teeth. I had another category I called \u201cday at the beach\u201d that had fishhooks and what I decided were shark fins, near another pillar titled \u201cweird blue shapes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeird blue shapes\u201d initially included what looked kind of like a yellow bird beak on a blue background, which I put there because I was in a hurry and because it was blue. But as the items in \u201cday at the beach\u201d grew more diverse, I decided the beaks were better off there, representing seagulls.\n\nLater in my play session, some Jesus fish appeared, and I panicked. Did they go in \u201cday at the beach\u201d because they were fish? Did they go in \u201cweird blue shapes\u201d because they were blue? They were kind of religious, so should they go near the ghosts and Shinto shrines in a category I\u2019d dubbed \u201cghosts and Shinto shrines\u201d?\n\nItems appear in black and white when you\u2019re too far from them, making the memory aspect of the game even more challenging\n\nWhen some cherries and lemons appeared, I put them on the other side of the beach pillar because I thought they resembled slot machine icons, turning \u201cday at the beach\u201d into \u201cday at Atlantic City.\u201d\n\nAs I started to unlock beehives and watermelons, I wondered if I should make a new category for food, or move all the foodstuff to \u201cmouth stuff\u201d because food goes in your mouth. Weird shapes that weren\u2019t blue showed up, expanding \u201cweird blue shapes\u201d into \u201cweird shapes.\u201d But then was that new item a weird shape or a pill? What kinds of things had I decided were weird shapes anyway? Where exactly had I put that one shape a customer was demanding?\n\nEvery few turns you get a free period to reorganise your items. While this could make Wilmot\u2019s Warehouse easier, giving you a chance to clean up your mess, deciding to overhaul your categories can make things worse. Not only do you have to remember what items you organised off-screen to deal with your growing inventory, but sometimes you have to completely rethink how you perceived an object or what you renamed a category.\n\nReorganising things means fighting against your own habits and the memory of your past decisions. I\u2019d forget that I\u2019d turned \u201cweird shapes\u201d into a couple of discrete categories and careen around my screen in a panic when a customer demanded an object I could vaguely remember putting someplace. I considered drawing a map to keep by my side as I played, but the game feels more hectic and fun without one.\n\nScreenshot: Steam\n\nCompleting deliveries under time earns you stars, which you can spend on upgrades. I\u2019ve upgraded Wilmot to be able to drag more blocks at a time, and to flip the positions of blocks for easier movement and organising.\n\nHe has a short dash he can perform when he\u2019s not carrying objects, and I\u2019m looking forward to the upgrade that lets me demolish pillars to make more space. My upgrades have helped me make deliveries faster, but the core of the game remains as challenging and delightful as when I first booted it up.\n\nAs I\u2019ve played, I\u2019ve been screaming nonsense like \u201cOh no, watermelons!\u201d and \u201cStop hiding, library!\u201d Wilmot\u2019s lack of constraints makes the game\u2019s challenge personal \u2014 the real puzzle is you.", "description": "When I first saw people on Twitter praising Wilmot\u2019s Warehouse, a new puzzle game for computers and Switch, I didn\u2019t get it.
