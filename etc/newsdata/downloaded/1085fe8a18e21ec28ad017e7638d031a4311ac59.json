Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\n\u201cWhat I also believe is that there is a Warren-wing of our party, and I would say that\u2019s most Democrats,\u201d Omar said, referencing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\n\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s the one thing that everybody accuses us of. We think we\u2019re the smartest in the room. We are very policy-oriented. We care about the details,\u201d she said, suggesting that voters are unable to completely understand what her party is fighting for.\n\n\u201cJust today we were, you know, fighting about a lot of things that most people can\u2019t understand, and there is that aspect of a Warren that is exciting. She has a plan for everything,\u201d she added:\n\nDespite Omar\u2019s seeming praise of Warren, she reiterated that she is pleased by her choice of endorsing Sanders for president.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to be reminded about the vision you truly believe in, and where your core values lie,\u201d Omar said.\n\n\u201cAnd for me, I know that there are people that have to switch some things around, and there are people that are just easy to believe in. And I was reminded that Bernie is one of the people,\u201d she continued.\n\nAnother portion of the interview featured Omar choosing between various pairs of candidates. When asked to choose between \u201cHillary or Tulsi\u201d Omar said, \u201cNone!\u201d She gave the same answer when asked to choose between Joe Biden (D) or Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).\n\n\u201cBut if you had to pick one? If one of them is the candidate for your party, who would you rather it be?\u201d Hasan pressed.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying if something tragic happens and they ended up being the nominee?\u201d Omar replied.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! It\u2019s hard!\u201d she added.", "description": "Rep Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said that Democrat lawmakers have been recently fighting for things that \"most people can't understand.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1163747078-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
