Named Pericles, the cloud canvassing app gives Brexit activists real-time voter information on the doorstep on polling day on their smartphones, and the party boasts the potentially election-winning database is the best of its kind.\n\nUntil recently, the Conservative Party\u2019s voter information software was called Merlin \u2014 named after the great magician of legend, one presumes, because it worked magic for the Tories at the ballot box \u2014 Pericles, on the other hand, was an ancient Greek ruler so enthusiastic about democracy his enemies dismissed him as a populist.\n\nYet under Pericles\u2019s rule, Athens became a great city of the ancient world. He pursued policies which enabled ordinary people to get involved in politics like never before, and created jobs by building the great structures by which we today remember ancient Greece, including the Parthenon.\n\nAllusions to the classical world have long been out of fashion in British politics, in part out of a sense of misplaced inverse-snobbery, and also perhaps from a desire by the aggressively centrist to put distance between themselves from the Virgil-quoting professor of ancient Greek and MP for Wolverhampton, Enoch Powell.\n\nBut, slowly, the classics are enjoying a revival, not just at the hands of Nigel Farage, but Tory leader Boris Johnson too.\n\nAppearing to retreat into his comfort zone during a punishing day between New York and London, Mr Johnson compared the delay forced on Brexit by Remainer politicians to the eternal punishment of Greek Titan Prometheus by Zeus while addressing the United Nations. Hours later and on the other end of a transatlantic flight to London, Johnson told Parliament he would resist the Siren calls to change course on Brexit, stating he would metaphorically lash himself to the mast of his ship like the ancient mariner Odysseus to take Britain out of the European Union on October 31st.\n\nFollowing emotional scenes in Parliament on Wednesday evening, in which several members appeared close to tears as they described the anguish of inexplicably finding themselves extremely unpopular with voters after three years of Brexit prevarication, would it be too much to hope that the next classical politics trend is towards Stoicism?\n\nDespite the strong physical resemblance between Jeremy Corbyn and Zeno of Citium, a sudden outbreak of virtue from those benches remains, at best, unlikely\u2026\n\nExplicitly or through implication Boris Johnson has compared himself to Odysseus, Prometheus, and possibly Heracles in one day \u2014 when will we reach peak classics in UK politics? For my own part, I will remain satisfied with my own pretensions to Diogenes with my sardonic lamp! pic.twitter.com/DBqVdDwaJs \u2014 Oliver JJ Lane (@oliver_lane) September 25, 2019", "description": "While being labelled a populist by liberal elites is meant as a criticism, Nigel Farage's Brexit Party appears to be embracing the term...", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-51242024-e1569470879117-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
