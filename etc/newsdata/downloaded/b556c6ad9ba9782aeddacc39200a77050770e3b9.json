But he apologized to fans, who had been developing conspiracy theories that he had been pressured to make the donation, in a video uploaded on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI made the mistake of picking a charity that I was advised to instead of picking a charity that I\u2019m personally passionate about,\u201d Kjellberg said in the video. \u201cWhich is 100% my fault.\u201d\n\nKjellberg, whose channel surpassed 100 million subscribers in August, has attracted controversy in the past for posting antisemitic jokes and videos and Nazi imagery. In 2017, Disney dropped PewDiePie as a sponsor after a report found he had posted nine videos involving offensive rhetoric, including one in which he paid two men to hold up a sign that read \u201cDeath to all Jews\u201d.\n\nHe has also been embraced by far-right extremists, including the Christchurch shooter, a gunman in New Zealand who killed 51 people in a mosque while livestreaming and calling on viewers to \u201csubscribe to PewDiePie\u201d.\n\nKjellberg removed some of his videos following the Christchurch shooting, saying in a statement he recognized some of his jokes were \u201cultimately offensive\u201d and he felt \u201cabsolutely sickened\u201d that the alleged gunman had mentioned him. The donation dedicated to the ADL was seen as his latest effort to distance himself from far-right hate speech, but his fans were not happy.\n\n\u201cAll that this particular incident shows is that at least some of his followers have antisemitic leanings and they were loud enough to get him to change course on what seemed like a PR opportunity to smooth over some of his incidents from the past,\u201d said Matt Rivitz, of the social media activism organization Sleeping Giants.\n\nThe controversies surrounding Kjellberg underscore problems YouTube faces with extremism on the platform, Rivitz said. The company came under fire in June for failing to remove the vlogger Steven Crowder from the platform after years of anti-gay abuse directed at the video journalist Carlos Maza. Meanwhile, a group of LGBTQ YouTubers are suing YouTube\u2019s parent company for allegedly censoring their content and incentivizing volatile behavior.\n\n\u201cYouTube has an extremism problem regardless of this particular incident,\u201d Rivitz said. \u201cThey have proven time and time again that they care more about engagement and ad rates than responsibility, which is why advertisers have such difficulty with them.\u201d\n\nYouTube did not respond to request for comment. The ADL said it had not heard from Kjellberg directly regarding the donation.\n\n\u201cADL learned about the potential donation from Felix Kjellberg when everyone else did: when he made the announcement on his channel earlier this week,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe have not received any communication from him beyond that.\u201d", "description": "Vlogger embraced by far right apologizes for planned donation to Anti-Defamation League, after fans claim conspiracy", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d9759a25269ff4dd7f4c41bde320c4928bdfb65/0_78_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b7df57975a1a82932da6bf6523771fb", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
