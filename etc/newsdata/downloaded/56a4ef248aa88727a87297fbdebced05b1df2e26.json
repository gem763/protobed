It\u2019s almost like maybe the Los Angeles Lakers betting the house on the King from Akron and Anthony Davis and whoever would want to come along for the ride possibly angered the basketball gods in some way. There was the hope that DeMarcus Cousins could help out, but then he tore his Achilles. Then things went from bad to worse when the team announced it was so desperate for players that they were reuniting with Anthony Davis.\n\nJust when you thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse for the Lakers, it was announced that forward Kyle Kuzma is out indefinitely thanks to a stress reaction in his foot. Kuzma, who could be counted on for 18.7 points and 5.5 rebounds a game last season, suffered the injury paying for Team USA over the summer.\n\nAs reported by ESPN, the 24-year-old Kuzma will travel with the team to China and is scheduled for an MRI when the team returns to the States. There\u2019s no clear timetable as to when he\u2019ll be able to play.\n\nThe Lakers have also announced that rookie Talen Horton-Tucker is continuing to receive treatment for a stress fracture in his right foot, and fellow rookie Jordan Caroline will be out 10 to 12 weeks after a successful surgery on his fifth metatarsal earlier this month.\n\nYou ever get the feeling LeBron and Davis will be playing a heck of a lot of minutes this year? It\u2019s starting to feel that way.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "Kyle Kuzma is out indefinitely thanks to a stress reaction in his foot.", "authors": ["Carl Caminetti"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1136293290.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
