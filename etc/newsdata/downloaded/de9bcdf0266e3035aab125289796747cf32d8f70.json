It was filed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer.\n\n\u201cDon McGahn did not testify before the grand jury. Indeed, none of the witnesses for whom the Committee requested FBI Interview Reports in Volume II of the Mueller Report \u2026 testified before the grand jury, with the exceptions of [redacted],\u201d the filing states. \u201cDonald Trump, Jr. also did not testify before the grand jury.\u201d\n\nJUST IN: DOJ confirms that Don MCGAHN and Donald Trump Jr. did not testify before the Mueller grand jury.

Howell noted in the opinion that Trump Jr. and McGahn were not subpoenaed.\n\n\u201cThe Special Counsel\u2019s reasons remain unknown,\u201d Howell wrote. \u201cThe reason is not that the individuals were insignificant to the investigation. To the contrary, both of the non-testifying individuals named in paragraph four figured in key events examined in the Mueller Report. Assessment of these choices by the Special Counsel is a matter for others.\u201d\n\nThe redacted court filing is part of a legal battle over Attorney General William Barr\u2019s refusal to give the House of Representatives the grand jury information that was redacted in Mueller\u2019s full report. The former special counsel\u2019s office investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential obstruction of justice into that investigation by the president.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing on the report, Mueller was asked if Donald Trump Jr. asserted that he would plead the Fifth Amendment if called to testify before the grand jury. The former special counsel would not say, though his report did include witnesses saying so. The report also said Trump Jr., who was at the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian officials, declined a voluntary interview.\n\nMueller\u2019s long-awaited report heavily relied on McGahn, who agreed to be privately interviewed for the investigation, and who witnessed many instances of potential obstruction. According to the special counsel\u2019s investigation, Trump allegedly tried to get McGahn to fire Mueller, and later pressured McGahn to deny that such a request occurred.\n\nMueller did not to come to a legal conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\nMcGahn\u2019s attorney Bill Burck told Politico on Sunday that because his client was willing to be interviewed by special counsel prosecutors, he did not need to go before a grand jury.", "description": "The Justice Department's confirmation about the president's son and former White House counsel is part of a newly unredacted filing ordered by a judge.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dace4c4210000c31b34a809.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
