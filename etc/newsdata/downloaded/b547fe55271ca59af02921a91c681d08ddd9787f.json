Their capabilities can range from identifying the approximate location of a cellphone to outright capturing sensitive data including the contents of calls.\n\nChristopher Krebs, a top cybersecurity official at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, revealed in June 2018 that federal officials conducting a pilot project within the nation\u2019s capital uncovered \u201canomalous activity that appeared consistent with IMSI catcher technology,\u201d including at locations \u201cin proximity to potentially sensitive facilities like the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on a detailed forensic analysis, the FBI and other agencies working on the case felt confident that Israeli agents had placed the devices, according to the former officials, several of whom served in top intelligence and national security posts,\u201d Politico subsequently reported this week.\n\nIt was not clear if the StingRays successfully captured any information of interest to its operators, the report said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied Israel was responsible for the surveillance devices, and a senior administration official told Politico that the White House does not \u201ccomment on matters related to security or intelligence,\u201d the outlet reported.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment about Politico\u2019s reporting. The White House and DHS did not immediately return messages requesting comment.\n\nSpeaking to journalists following publication of the Politico report, Mr. Netanyahu insisted Israel adheres to an agreement not to conduct intelligence gathering operations within the U.S., one of its closest allies.\n\n\u201cWe have a directive, I have a directive: No intelligence work in the United States, no spies,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said, calling the Politico report \u201ca complete fabrication.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
