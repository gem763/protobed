But because he is not a natural-born citizen, the Constitution bars him from becoming president.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Terminator star said when asked if he was disappointed that he could never become president. \u201cIt would have been great to jump in and run.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I can\u2019t do in America. Everything else I\u2019ve done is because it is in America, it\u2019s the land of opportunity,\u201d Schwarzenegger added.\n\nSchwarzenegger has lamented his ineligibility to run for president many times since he won office in California. In 2016 he told Ad Week that he wished he could run for president instead of Trump.\n\nStill, even though he ran for, and won, the office of Governor of California, Schwarzenegger insisted that he hates politics.\n\n\u201cI hate politics. Even when I was Governor (of California), I never considered myself a politician,\u201d he told Norton.\n\nThe Predator star also told Adweek that he was never very fond of politics. \u201cI didn\u2019t love politics,\u201d he said of his time in the governor\u2019s office, \u201cbut I love policy.\u201d\n\nStill, the actor is busy campaigning against gerrymandering, fighting climate change, and takes often takes shots at President Donald Trump.\n\nSchwarzenegger will co-star in Terminator: Dark Fate debuting next month.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger is still lamenting the fact that the U.S. Constitution bars him from running for president.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Schwarzeneggermaps1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
