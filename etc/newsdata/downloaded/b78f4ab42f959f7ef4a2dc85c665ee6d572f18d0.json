According to O\u2019Hara, about 350 workers from Lordstown had been transferred to Spring Hill earlier this year, which likely affected the \u201cno\u201d vote. He expects a similar result on Thursday. \u201cJust speaking for 1112, I\u2019m going to say the majority of them, no matter whether they\u2019re in the Valley or in another state, will probably be voting no,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. Denison agreed: \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a couple people that were on the fence, but I haven\u2019t heard, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m voting on this.\u2019 The overwhelming majority are \u2018no\u2019...\u201d\n\nAs I wrote in June, Lordstown workers have a history of rebellion\u2014both against the company and the UAW International. \u201cI have been feeling for several months that we probably would not be reopened,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. \u201cI know that GM was dead set on never opening that plant again and I think they wanted to break up Local 1112 because the local\u2019s always been a thorn in their side, going all the way back to the early 1970s.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, Lordstown was ground zero for working-class disaffection. \u201cA new generation of workers who came of age during the counterculture and Vietnam War era had little interest in listening to the authority of the foremen in their factories,\u201d said Erik Loomis, historian and author of A History of America in Ten Strikes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have much interest in spending thirty years working the drudgery of a GM assembly line either. They wanted more control over their lives on and off the job.\u201d The workers struck in 1972, demanding changes to the production process, slowing down the assembly line and reining in belligerent managers. But the UAW leadership settled with GM for the usual terms: improved wages and benefits, rather than more control over production. \u201cThe Lordstown strike of 1972 could have been the first blow toward a new era of thinking about work and life for the American working class,\u201d Loomis said. \u201cInstead, deindustralization, capital mobility, automation, and union-busting decimated the working class.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current strike was long-brewing, born of decades of concessionary contracts\u2014particularly the two-tier (in practice, more like four-tier) wage system that was agreed to during desperate economic times in 2007. And once again, the Lordstown workers feel betrayed by UAW\u2019s leaders. \u201cTo me, the strike was a huge fail on International\u2019s part, because the membership did their job, and then some,\u201d Denison said. The members from around the country came together not because the International leadership asked them to, he said, but \u201cbecause they\u2019ve been beaten down so much in the factory shop floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ability of UAW leaders in Detroit to reopen factories such as Lordstown is pretty limited. The union isn\u2019t that strong anymore,\u201d Loomis noted. \u201cOn the other hand, in the nearly half-century since Lordstown, union leaders also haven\u2019t thought outside the box to empower communities such as Lordstown and have too often worked with companies to actively disempower workers in exchange for small contract victories and good relationships with the Big Three automakers.\u201d", "description": "With General Motors workers on strike since mid-September, a labor union in Ohio votes on a controversial contract.", "authors": ["Sarah Jaffe"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/251da250ce164555bbecc1ceff29315705c3e820.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
