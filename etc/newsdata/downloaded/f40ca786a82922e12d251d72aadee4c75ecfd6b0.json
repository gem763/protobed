Mueller investigation: The key figures 1/12 Robert Mueller is the special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, and potential obstruction of justice by the president. Mr Mueller has a pristine reputation in Washington, where he was previously in charge of the FBI. Throughout his investigation, he and his team have been notoriously tight lipped about what they know and where their investigation has led. REUTERS 2/12 Former FBI director James Comey was the catalyst that led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Comey was fired by the president after Mr Trump reportedly asked him to drop his own Russia investigation. Mr Trump has long maintained that the investigation is a \"witch hunt\". AFP/Getty Images 3/12 Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had authority over the special counsel investigation for much of the two years it has been active. Mr Rosenstein found himself with that responsibility after then-attorney general Jeff Sessions recused himself from that oversight. AP 4/12 Attorney general Jeff Sessions's decision to recuse himself from oversight of the special counsel investigation may have cost him his job in the end. Mr Sessions resigned last year, after weathering a contentious relationship with Donald Trump who vocally criticised his attorney general for taking a step back. Mr Sessions recused himself from the oversight citing longstanding Justice Department rules to not be involved in investigations overseeing campaigns that officials were apart of. AP 5/12 Attorney General William Barr is currently responsible for oversight of the special counsel investigation. Mr Barr's office will be the first to receive the Mueller report when it is finished. His office will then determine what portion or version of that report should be delivered to Congress, and also made public. EPA 6/12 Michal Cohn is the president's former personal lawyer, who has been helping the special counsel investigation as a part of a plea deal over financial crimes, and campaign finance crimes, he has pleaded guilty to. Among those crimes, Cohen admitted to facilitating $130,000 in hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign. Cohen has said he did so at the direction of Mr Trump. Cohen has also admitted that he maintained contacts with Russian officials about a potential Trump real estate project in Moscow for months longer than Mr Trump and others admitted. The talks continued well into 2016 during the campaign, he has said. AP 7/12 Stormy Daniels has alleged that she had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006, soon after Melania Trump gave birth to Baron Trump. The accusation is of particular importance as a result of the $130,000 hush money payment she received to keep quiet about the affair during the 2016 campaign. AP 8/12 Paul Manafort was Donald Trump's former campaign chairman. Manafort was charged alongside Rick Gates for a slew of financial crimes, and was convicted on several counts in a Virginia court. He then pleaded guilty to separate charges filed in a Washington court. Manafort has been sentenced to just 7.5 years in prison for his crimes \u2014 in spite of recommendations from the special counsel's office for a much harsher sentence. AP 9/12 George Papadopoulos was one of the first individuals associated with the Trump campaign to be charged by the Mueller probe. He ultimately received a 14 day prison sentence for lying to investigators about contacts he had with Russian officials. AP 10/12 Roger Stone is a well known political fixer and operative, who has made a name for himself for some dirty tactics. He has been charged by the Mueller probe earlier this year, and he has been said to have had prior knowledge that WikiLeaks planned on publishing stolen emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016.

Gates, who worked alongside Manafort for a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party. The two were charged with conspiracy and financial crimes. Gates pleaded guilty. AP 12/12 Former national security adviser Michael Flynn was one of the first casualties of the Russia scandal, and was forced out of his position in the White House weeks after Donald Trump took office. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to \"willfully\" making fraudulent statements about contacts he had with Russian officials including former Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Flynn then lied to Vice President Mike Pence about that contact.

He repeatedly has mentioned Ms Hill\u2019s congressional seat in recent tweets.\n\nOne day before the photos of Ms Hill were published, he tweeted: \u201dCalifornia\u2019s 25th congressional district looks like it\u2019s for the taking.\u201d\n\nIn another post after the photos came out, Mr Papadopoulos slammed Hill as an \u201cembarrassment to the great people in that district\u201d.\n\n\u201cSomeone has to step up,\u201d he tweeted on Sunday, following Ms Hill\u2019s announcement. \u201cI love my state too much to see it run down by candidates like Hill. All talk, no action, and a bunch of sell outs.\u201d\n\nMr Papadopoulos\u2019 political career began in 2015, not long after Mr Trump came down the escalator at Trump Tower, TA Frank wrote in a profile published this year in The Washington Post.\n\nHis initial attempt to join the Trump campaign did not pan out and he ended up briefly serving as an adviser for then-presidential candidate Ben Carson before taking a job with the London Centre of International Law Practice.\n\nBut Mr Papadopoulos never gave up on his goal of working for Trump\u2019s campaign and eventually came on as a foreign policy adviser in March 2016, Mr Frank reported.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an oil and energy consultant,\u201d Mr Trump said of him, according to The Post. \u201cExcellent guy.\u201d\n\nWithin days of starting his new role, Mr Papadopoulos, guided by the campaign\u2019s interest in improving relations with Moscow, was already working to get Mr Trump a meeting with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.\n\nMr Papadopoulos\u2019 efforts led him to a London-based professor, who told him that the Russians had access to \u201cdirt\u201d on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, namely damaging emails.\n\nHe stayed in contact with the professor and later communicated with Russian nationals, including a woman he incorrectly believed was Mr Putin\u2019s niece.\n\nThen, in May 2016, the situation took a turn.\n\nThat is when Mr Papadopoulos made an offhand remark about the Russians and their \u201cdirt\u201d on Ms Clinton to an Australian diplomat over drinks at a bar in London, according to The Post.\n\nThis conversation between Mr Papadopoulos and the diplomat, who promptly relayed the information to American officials, helped trigger the FBI investigation of Trump\u2019s campaign in late July 2016.\n\nAbout a year later, Mr Papadopoulos was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport, accused of making false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts.\n\nOn 5 October 2017, he admitted to lying, becoming the first Trump official to plead guilty and cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nHe served 12 days in federal prison last year.\n\nSince his release in December 2018, Mr Papadopoulos has participated in a documentary series chronicling his relationship with his wife and the aftermath of the Russia investigation, and wrote a book, Deep State Target: How I Got Caught in the Crosshairs of the Plot to Bring Down President Trump.\n\nBecoming a politician has also been on his to-do list.\n\n\u201cI will be running for congress in 2020, and I will win,\u201d he tweeted days after leaving a federal prison in Wisconsin in December. \u201cStay tuned.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "George Papadopoulos\u2018 first major political role, serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016, catapulted him into the centre of an international scandal and ultimately landed him in prison.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/02/21/gettyimages-1138504168.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
