It was only about 25 degrees cooler than Thursday! While near and above 70 is closer to normal than we saw Thursday, it may have still been quite a shock to the system. If nothing else, I hope you\u2019ll have a chance to open up the windows and let some of that fresh air in!\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Clouds stick with us through the night. It will keep feeling cool and clammy with relatively high humidity given the lower temperatures. Some patchy fog or drizzle is not impossible, but winds will not die off entirely, which should keep much from forming. Lows settle across the 60s. Winds are out of the east about 5 to 10 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Saturday): It is often hard to ditch these marine air masses and the clouds they deliver. That should be the case here. I think we will see at least a few peeks of sun later in the day, but perhaps not many. Without sun, temperatures struggle a bit. It is warmer than today with highs topping out in the upper 70s and lower 80s most spots. Winds turn to come more from the south with time, which helps bring some of that warmer air. They blow about 5 to 10 mph. A small chance of a late-day shower or storm may present itself.\n\nSunday: There could still be some clouds hanging out in the morning, but they should give way quicker and easier than Saturday. This helps temperatures aim for the mid-80s for highs. There could be an isolated late-day storm, just do not plan on much.\n\nSee Camden Walker\u2019s forecast through the beginning of next week.
