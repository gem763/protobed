The gunfire sent people running for the exits, with the injured leaving trails of blood as they fled. One of the injured was trying to get a ride to the hospital when ambulances arrived.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty small bar, so if you have two guys come in and start shooting, people are just running, running anywhere they can,\u201d Tomasic said.\n\nAll four men who were killed were Hispanic, but Tomasic said authorities do not believe the shooting was racially motivated. The shooting happened in a neighborhood with a large Hispanic population.\n\nTomasic cautioned that police were still investigating exactly what happened. He said they were reviewing surveillance video and interviewing witnesses while looking for the gunmen.\n\n\u201cObviously being a bar at 1.30, stories vary a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the dead was one man in his late 50s, another in his mid-30s and two in their mid-20s, police said. Authorities did not immediately release their names.\n\nHowever, Juan Ramirez, of Kansas City, Kansas, told The Kansas City Star that his 29-year-old nephew was among those killed. He said his nephew left behind a 6-year-old son and a 4-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wish this upon anybody,\u201d Ramirez said.", "description": "* Two gunmen opened fire at 1:30am at the Tequila KC Bar  * Police say shooting believed to have stemmed from earlier disputeImage from 41 KSHB Kansas City Action News police at the scene of a shooting outside a Kansas City, Kansas bar on Sunday.
