All five will report their results in the next month.\n\nThe recommendations are based on options-market prices for each company and the potential that they will beat or fall short of consensus estimates.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nTraders will be flooded with company earnings reports over the next couple of weeks, and many of them are going to lead to dramatic reactions on Wall Street.\n\nBut identifying the best opportunities ahead of those reports isn't easy. Goldman Sachs equity-derivatives associate Vishal Vivek says the options market suggests this might be an especially volatile earnings season, and he named five stocks that could make big moves.\n\nFor all of them, Vivek said Goldman's analysts believed the company might do substantially better or worse than the rest of Wall Street expects, while options prices are fairly low compared with the potential gain for investors. All five of these companies will report earnings in the next month.\n\n(1) Lockheed Martin\n\nTrade: Buy LMT Nov-19 monthly $385 calls recently offered at $8.80\n\nThe aerospace and defense giant will report on October 22, and Goldman's analysts expect Lockheed to raise its annual guidance for the second time. They are also optimistic for 2020 and expect a potentially bullish cash-flow target covering the next three years, and Goldman's price target on the stock implies a 16% rally over the next year.\n\nDespite all of that, Vivek says options prices for Lockheed are down.\n\n(2) Albemarle\n\nTrade: Buy ALB Nov-19 monthly $70 calls recently offered at $2.20\n\nThe largest lithium miner makes its report on November 7, and Goldman Sachs says Albemarle is holding up very well as its competitors struggle and slash their estimates. Vivek notes that his firm's price target implies 41% upside for Albemarle shares.\n\n\"The stock's current valuation levels do not account for the company's best-in-class asset position, its unique long-term, fixed-price contract exposure and the likely continued challenge for the lithium industry to meet expected surging demand trends in the coming years,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\n\n(3) Gilead Sciences\n\nTrade: Buy GLD Nov-19 monthly $65 puts recently offered at $1.73\n\nThe drugmaker reports its earnings on October 24, and Goldman says it faces major challenges. Vivek said it would face a $3 billion headwind when generic versions of its HIV drugs Atripla and Truvada hit the market in September 2020, and Gilead doesn't have enough promising drugs in its pipeline to replace the revenue it will lose when other HIV drugs go off patent.\n\nDespite those challenges, Vivek said Gilead options prices were about average, and the stock has performed about as well as the broader healthcare sector has this year.\n\n(4) Western Digital\n\nTrade: Buy WDC Nov-19 monthly $60 calls recently offered at $3.70\n\nThe hard-drive and data-storage company is scheduled to make its fiscal first-quarter report on October 30, and Vivek said his firm thinks Wall Street is selling Western Digital short: Goldman's analysts believe it could beat consensus earnings estimates by 20%, thanks to better trends in the data-center business and stabilizing NAND memory pricing.\n\nVivek added that options traders were taking a bearish position on Western Digital, as call prices are low. Implied volatility is also low.\n\n(5) Take-Two Interactive Software\n\nTrade: Buy TTWO Nov-19 monthly $125 calls recently offered at $6.05\n\nThe publisher of video games, including \"Grand Theft Auto,\" \"NBA 2K,\" and \"Red Dead,\" is expected to report fiscal second-quarter results on November 7. Vivek said the company had the potential to beat estimates and has shared early positive feedback about several recent releases.\n\nOver the longer term, he said Take-Two was planning three to five strong releases a year, along with its annual titles, which should help long-term growth, while its emphasis on cloud gaming should help its business in China and could attract price-sensitive consumers.\n\nHe added that options prices were low relative to previous earnings periods.", "description": "Goldman Sachs says it's found five attractively priced options trades investors can use to beat the market during a turbulent earnings season.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da047a8cc4a0a6edd650285?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
