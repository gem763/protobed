There was no lovemaking to disturb, though\u2014the hotel had been abandoned for at least 10 years. It was one of Japan\u2019s many haikyo or ruins, lusted after by urban explorers.\n\nThough obviously dilapidated, Japan\u2019s ruins remain frozen in time like an alternate reality of the last day they were occupied.\n\nI\u2019ve crawled my way into a few decaying buildings back home in America, but nothing compares to urban exploring in Japan. Though obviously dilapidated, Japan\u2019s ruins remain frozen in time like an alternate reality of the last day they were occupied. Hotels with medieval-themed decor still intact and amusement parks with rusted games sit in place as if one day someone simply got up and walked away from them.\n\nPhoto: Randiah Camille Green A shooting game from the abandoned Western Village amusement park in Tochigi Prefecture.\n\nTaking pictures of abandoned buildings as a hobby sometimes gets a bad reputation for exploiting someone\u2019s misfortune or tragedy for the sake of an Instagram aesthetic. For that reason, it\u2019s important to know the history around these spots, and not to disturb anything you may find.\n\nHere are some of the most interesting and totally wicked haikyo in Japan.\n\nFurin Love Hotel (Chiba)\n\nPhoto: Randiah Camille Green Does this room turn you on?\n\nTen themed rooms for lovemaking are available at the Furin Hotel in Chiba\u2019s quiet countryside. Choose from a traditional ryokan (Japanese inn) style or Greek deco room complete with Grecian pillars. My personal favorite is the medieval room decked out with full-scale armor, sexy red curtains, and a grandiose chandelier.\n\nNot much is actually known about this haikyo, but it is one of the most popular amongst urban explorers for obvious reasons. Now it sits in a sunken state of disrepair with collapsed ceilings making half of the rooms inaccessible.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad it was abandoned in 2010 because I would have liked to spend a night here myself. Perhaps sex isn\u2019t quite the lucrative business in a countryside town with an aging population.\n\nNegishi Grandstand (Yokohama)\n\nYokohama\u2019s Negishi Forest Park is a chill spot for cherry blossom viewing parties, but the menacing gothic building standing beside it may throw off the springtime vibes.\n\nThe Yokohama Negishi Grandstand has been around since 1866 when it was opened as a horse racing facility. The behemoth of a building was apparently frequented by Emperor Meiji himself.\n\nPhoto: Randiah Camille Green A menacing eyesore.\n\nDuring WWII the building was used as a printing headquarters for the Japanese military, and a holding for Australian prisoners. After Japan surrendered, the U.S. military claimed the building as their own and the surrounding area became Negishi Heights, a residential complex for U.S. forces. The building was returned to Japanese ownership in the \u201880s but the history of foreign influences on the area is evident.\n\nPhoto: Randiah Camille Green Layers upon layers of dust.\n\nThe inside looks like a dystopian stronghold where the leaders of a rebel group would hole up after the apocalypse. Withered documents and rusted metal machinery are strewn about, but the view over Negishi from the roof is stunning. That is if you can even get inside\u2014it\u2019s protected by an iron fence and barbed wire.\n\nWestern Village (Tochigi)\n\nWelcome to the wild wild west, where dusty arcade games and busted cowboy mannequins are all the rage. Back in the early \u201870s someone with a lot of money and no better way to spend it opened this American Western-themed park three hours north of Tokyo in Tochigi Prefecture.\n\nPhoto: Shotaro Honda Moore We aren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s rust or blood.\n\nIt was originally a ranch where people could experience horseback riding and all the joys of cowboy life. It gradually expanded into a full-blown amusement park complete with carnival games, bumper cars and more.\n\nThere\u2019s a shootout going down in the saloon and Buffalo Bill has escaped from prison again. There\u2019s also a life-sized replica of Mount Rushmore because that just screams \u201cAmerica.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Shotaro Honda Moore The haunted version of Disney\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d ride.\n\nThe park was abandoned in 2007 and has been a hotspot for urbex photographers ever since. Don\u2019t worry, any body parts you see scattered around are from the poor animatronic mannequins that were left behind, and not human.\n\nThe Former Japanese Navy Underground Bunker (Okinawa)\n\nOkinawa has an unfortunate war history that many people aren\u2019t aware of when they visit the subtropical paradise full of friendly locals. The Former Japanese Navy Underground Headquarters puts that history on full display.\n\nPhoto: Randiah Camille Green These tunnels where 5,000 men died during WWII are uncomfortably creepy.\n\nIn April of 1945 America launched a full-scale assault on the Japanese Imperial Army that had occupied the Okinawan shores. The 82-day long attack cost thousands of Okinawans\u2014who had no interest in the war\u2014their families, homes, and ultimately their lives. When the Japanese navy soldiers retreated to their underground headquarters, the Americans flooded them with poisonous gas.\n\nAn unsettling feeling will follow you as you explore the bunker walls still riddled with holes from hand grenade suicides.\n\nOn June 13, 1945, Commanding Officer of the Japanese Imperial Navy Minoru Ota committed suicide in this underground bunker with the threat of defeat looming closer. He\u2019d rather die by his own hands than those of the enemy. Before killing himself, Ota sent a telegram to the mainland expressing remorse for the suffering of the Okinawan people.\n\nPhoto: Randiah Camille Green Marks from a hand grenade blast when several navy troops committed suicide.\n\nOther navy troops followed suit and by the end around 5,000 men had died in the bunker either by suicide, explosions, or gas attacks. That bunker is now a museum. Stiff air and an unsettling feeling will follow you as you explore the bunker walls still riddled with holes from hand grenade suicides.\n\nWhile technically not abandoned, the chilling history of the tunnels can be felt through its ominous atmosphere.\n\nGunkanjima Island (Nagashima)\n\nThe most famous haikyo on the list, Gunkanjima or Hashima Island, was the inspiration for the villain\u2019s hideout in Skyfall, the 2012 James Bond film.\n\nThe previously-uninhabited island was ripe for coal mining in 1890 when it was purchased by Mitsubishi and populated by the company\u2019s workers. The coal miners had their own little world with high-rise apartment buildings, schools, and hospitals built just for them.\n\nAn abandoned school on Gunkanjima island.\n\nNothing lasts forever though, and the coal mines dried up in the 1970s leaving the miners without jobs. Naturally, a mass exodus occurred and the entire island was completed deserted. Now considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site as a relic of the Meiji Industrial Revolution, the island remains controversial as Koreans and Chinese were forced into labor here during WWII.\n\nThis is a truly apocalyptic scene as entire buildings were left behind with everything from electronics to clothing still inside. Exploring on your own is impossible unless you have permission from the local government, and the threat of collapsing buildings is real.\n\nPhoto: Akira Kawamura It\u2019s dangerous to explore the island alone.\n\nSome private companies offer tours to the island but they only take you to limited \u201csafe zones.\u201d Due to typhoon damage in September of 2019, however, boats are currently unable to actually land on the island. You can still take a tour of the island\u2019s perimeter from the safety of the boat if you really just want to see it up close.\n\nInterested in more creepy places in Japan?
