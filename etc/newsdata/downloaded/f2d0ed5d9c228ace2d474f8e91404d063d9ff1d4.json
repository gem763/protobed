What this new study shows is that our biological clocks not only affect our metabolism but also what we choose to eat.\"\n\nFor the study, researchers looked at data from nearly 2,000 randomly chosen people to determine if their circadian or biological clock rhythm (chronotype) affected what they ate and at what time.\n\nDifferences in both energy and macronutrients between the two chronotypes were evident, with morning people making healthier choices throughout the day.\n\nEvening types ate less protein overall and ate more sucrose, a type of sugar, in the morning. In the evening, night owls consuming more sucrose, fat and saturated fatty acids.\n\nOn weekends, the differences between the morning and evening type people was even more pronounced, with evening types having more irregular meal times and twice as many eating occasions. The evening types also slept worse and were less physically active overall.\n\nFor people working to lose weight, this new research may also provide a compelling window into why they choose to make certain food choices throughout the day.\n\n\"Clinicians can help steer people to healthier options - and suggest the optimal time to eat these foods - based on what we now know about our biological clocks,\" added Dr. Peterson.\n\nThe full study has been published in journal Obesity.\n\n\u00a9 Cover Media", "description": "Early morning risers are more likely to make healthier food choices than people who stay up late, new research finds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5872/01497fcf0d5b42aabd6763875d6639f4.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-01"}
