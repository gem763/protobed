Bernie Sanders was covered for only 10 minutes, followed by Beto O\u2019Rourke eight minutes and Cory Booker\u2019s seven minutes.\n\nNoyes found that nearly 14 hours of coverage devoted to Trump was mostly negative.\n\n\u201cThe airtime devoted to Trump was eleven times greater than that spent on the leading Democratic candidate.\u201d \u2014 Rich Noyes\n\n\u201cOverall, 21 Democratic candidates shared 187 minutes of evening news airtime this summer, less than one-fourth of that of Trump alone,\u201d Noyes wrote. \u201cClearly, this heavy coverage is not intended to boost Trump. Overall, the spin of his coverage during these three months was 90% negative.\u201d\n\nNoyes added that negative coverage is defined by tallying \u201call explicitly evaluative statements about the President or his administration from either reporters, anchors or non-partisan sources such as experts or voters.\u201d\n\nCNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: \u2018IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING\u2019\n\nAccording to Noyes, much of the nearly 14 hours of Trump coverage was focused on \u201calleged scandals and accusations of racism\u201d and the time period analyzed featured 82 minutes on the Russia investigation alone across ABC, NBC and CBS evening newscasts, with significant time spent on other negative stories, too.\n\n\u201cNetwork reporters seemed especially interested in topics they claimed showed the President displaying racial insensitivity, spending nearly 74 minutes on Trump\u2019s feud with the far-left \u2018Squad\u2019 of Democratic Congresswomen,\u201d Noyes wrote.\n\nWhile Trump was the focal point, Noyes pointed out that Biden and Buttigieg also received some negative coverage over the summer.\n\n\u201cThe network spin on the Democrats was friendlier than their coverage of the President, but it was still more negative than positive: 63 percent negative, vs. 37 percent positive,\u201d Noyes added. \u201cThe media mania over Trump is more intense than that of four summers ago, but the pattern is similar.\u201d\n\nTRUMP RENEWS CRITICISM OF CNN, MSNBC IN SCATHING TWEETS\n\nNoyes pointed out that Trump \u201cimmediately dominated network news coverage with 232 minutes of airtime\u201d after announcing his candidacy in June 2015, which was double what Hillary Clinton received over the same time period.\n\n\u201cNo other candidate received even one-tenth as much coverage as Trump did that summer,\u201d Noyes wrote. \u201cDemocratic socialist Bernie Sanders, who would go on to win 22 state caucuses and primaries in 2016, received just under 13 minutes of evening news coverage in the summer of 2015 \u2014 but that\u2019s actually better than the 10 minutes he received this time around.\u201d\n\nNoyes ended his analysis by questioning if history will repeat itself.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, it seems likely that the networks\u2019 incessant pounding of Trump in 2015 actually aided his candidacy, with the other candidates shoved to the sidelines as journalists jumped into the fray themselves,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill the anti-Trump media\u2019s attempt to kill his re-election campaign with massive and poisonous press coverage again boomerang?\u201d", "description": "ABC, NBC and CBS spent so much time covering President Trump over the summer that little space was available for 2020 Democratic hopefuls, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Rich Noyes", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
