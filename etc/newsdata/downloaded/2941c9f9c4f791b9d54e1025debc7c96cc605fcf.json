How Wide Is the Eye? Your Questions Answered.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "As Hurricane Dorian, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic, continues to batter the Bahamas and approach the United States mainland, millions of people who may be in its path are watching \u2014 and worrying. We asked readers what they want to know about Dorian. Answering those questions is Prof. Adam Sobel, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate at Columbia University and the author of \u201cStorm Surge,\u201d a book about Superstorm Sandy.\n\n[Read the latest coverage of Hurricane Dorian as it heads to Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.]\n\nWhat makes a hurricane change course?\n\nThe motion of hurricanes is determined mainly by what meteorologists call the \u201csteering flow,\u201d or \u201cenvironmental flow,\u201d meaning the winds on a larger scale, excluding the swirling circulation of the hurricane itself. Think of the storm as a swirl you make in a river with a canoe paddle: It has its own little circulation, but the whole thing drifts with the river current on the larger scale. The environmental flow can vary in both speed and direction at different altitudes; the storm follows the low-level winds most, but the winds higher up also have an influence.\n\nIf left to itself, a hurricane would drift slowly toward the North or South Pole, depending on which hemisphere it is in. But the steering flows rarely leave a hurricane to itself. A hurricane turns when it encounters a steering flow that blows in a different direction than the storm was being driven before.", "description": "Understanding and forecasting a giant storm requires knowledge, experience and data \u2014 a lot of it, though scientists could always use more.", "authors": ["Adam Sobel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/us/03dorianquestions/03dorianquestions-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
