I\u2019m being impeached! It\u2019s the greatest presidential harassment of all-time\u2014I would know. I\u2019m like the president of harassment,\u201d shouted Trump.\n\n\u201cYou gotta relax, Mr. Trump. We got nothing to worry about. Nobody\u2019s going to find out about our illegal side-dealings with the Ukraine, or how we tried to cover up those side-dealings, or how we tried to cover up the cover-up,\u201d offered Giuliani, before the two realized that the former mayor of New York City was actually on CNN.\n\n\u201cWell, stay calm, Mr. President. I know things look tough right now, but I got our top guy on this,\u201d Giuliani added, before throwing to Aidy Bryant as Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going to find a sacrificial patsy who will do anything you say? Not it!\u201d Barr exclaimed, with the action then cutting to Beck Bennett\u2019s Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just calling you about this whole Ukraine-whistleblower thing. It\u2019s looking pretty bad for you,\u201d Trump told Pence.\n\n\u201cFor me? But you\u2019re the one who broke the law!\u201d a confused Pence replied.\n\nOther cameos followed, including the president\u2019s large adult sons, Eric Trump and Don Jr., with the latter whining, \u201cI just can\u2019t believe the lamestream media is focused on you and not the corruption of Joe Biden\u2019s son!\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone, North Korean dictator (and friend of Trump) Kim Jong Un\u2014played by SNL newcomer Bowen Yang, the first cast member of Asian descent\u2014offered his (questionable) advice on how he handles whistleblowers in the Hermit Kingdom: \u201cOh, that\u2019s easy. You have a big ocean in your country? OK. Send whistleblower to the bottom of there.\u201d\n\nThe segment concluded with Chris Redd\u2019s Kanye West and Kenan Thompson\u2019s Don King finally breaking ties with Trump over the impeachment hullabaloo.\n\n\u201cThis whole impeachment thing is hurting our brand,\u201d opined King, at which point West chimed in, \u201cWe gotta go, so say goodbye to the douchebag.\u201d", "description": "Yes, Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump returned for the opening monologue to the late-night sketch show.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_778,w_1382,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569730564/Screen_Shot_2019-09-29_at_12.04.17_AM_ptamds", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
