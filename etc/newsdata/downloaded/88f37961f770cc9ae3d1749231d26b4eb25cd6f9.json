I can\u2019t let him get away with this. In this video I step in to expose the Joker for what he is (boring) and clowns for what they are.\n\nFor one thing, the Joker\u2019s not even funny. Additionally, you shouldn\u2019t trust clowns. Can you even remember the last time a clown was not a criminal? The discourse surrounding this film represents an Opinion Emergency, and someone needs to stop it. I suggest you do the brave thing: don\u2019t see it. No matter how much your friends are talking about it.\n\nBy the way! If you personally liked, commented and / or subscribed to our YouTube channel, that would definitely fuel my habit of making a lot more videos like this. I promise you might love it.\n\nThere\u2019s even a playlist of all my other videos. Wow!", "description": "A new film starring The Joker is out now in theatres worldwide.
