Acclaimed Canadian graphic novelist Walter Scott is one of the featured artists.\n\nScott is a multi-disciplinary artist that grew up on the Kahnaw\u00e1:ke Mohawk Territory in Quebec and moved to Montreal to pursue his art. He joined q's Tom Power from New York to discuss his lifelong self-serialisation comic Wendy and how it features his comic alter-ego, a young post-grad art student making her way as an artist in the 21st century.\n\nIn the Making takes you on an immersive journey inside the lives and work of Canada's leading artists.
