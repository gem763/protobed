Her account was suspended following her arrest but several fan accounts have photos and videos of Tabar.\n\nMany of the videos show Tabar singing along to Iranian pop songs and dancing. In one video posted to a fan account, she can be seen sporting orange and yellow dreadlocks and eating a cucumber.\n\nTabar is 22 years old and according to Radio Farda is rumoured to have had over 50 cosmetic procedures, although she has publicly said that much of her look comes down to \"heavy editing.\" Radio Farda is the Iranian branch of the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasting service.\n\n\n\nIt is not known exactly how many surgeries Tabar has had, but in a 2017 interview published by the Russian government-owned news site Sputnik, she said that she has had a nose job, botox, and liposuction.\n\n\"I don't see anything bad in this. It's simple and many people around the world do it. Here in Tehran the cost of one operation is 10 million Iranian rials (around R4,500)\" she said.\n\nBBC Persian reported that when Tabar first made headlines many people said that she had undergone surgery in an attempt to look like Angelina Jolie.\n\nHowever Tabar denied she ever intended to look like Jolie in her interview with Sputnik.\n\n\n\nWhen asked whether she intended to alter her features to resemble the Hollywood actress Tabar said: \"Never. I had no interest at all to be like Angelina Jolie, and I did not want to look like the character from \"Corpse Bride\".\n\n\"I understand that I do have some similarities with them, but I am my own muse and I did not want to look like anyone. That was not my aim.\n\nIn the same interview she also details how makeup and photoshop are a component of her look.\n\nTabar considers her appearance \"an art form,\" and \"a form of self expression\".\n\nTabar was accused of several crimes by Iranian authorities, and arrested last weekend\n\nHer arrest came as a result of several public complaints made against her by people over her social media posts according to Tasnim.\n\nTabar's charges included blasphemy, inciting violence, corrupting youth and obtaining money through illegitimate means, Tasnim reported.\n\n\n\nReza Sobh Khiz, a cybersecurity expert said on an Iranian news show on Monday that under Iranian laws Taber could be facing anywhere between 91 days and two years in jail for these crimes.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "22-year-old Sahar Tabar gained international fame for her drastic cosmetic surgery procedures that led to her resembling Angelina Jolie.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9459/93935b3269584d35a9934a7734a176ff.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-01"}
