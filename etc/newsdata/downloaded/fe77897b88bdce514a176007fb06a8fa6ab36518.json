Now coach Jeff Brohm is considering a major shake-up.\n\nTwo days after the Boilermakers allowed 10 sacks in a 35-7 loss at Penn State, Brohm opened up the possibility of replacing as many as four starters for Saturday\u2019s game against Maryland.\n\n\u201cWe are not where we need to be. That\u2019s a fact,\u201d Brohm said Monday at his weekly news conference when asked specifically about the line. \u201cWe got beat. You know what, some guys do a good job, and it just seems on every play there\u2019s one guy that\u2019s having a hard time and that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s getting exposed.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of blame to go around.\n\nLeft tackle Grant Hermanns and right guard Matt McCann both started last season and were expected to anchor the unit.\n\nWhile Hermanns has played well, McCann suffered an ankle injury against Vanderbilt and missed the TCU game before returning for the first two Big Ten games. Brohm said McCann, a fifth-year senior, allowed Penn State to get a pass rusher free when he missed the cadence and was late off the ball.\n\nCenter Viktor Beach, left guard Alex Criddle and right tackle Will Bramel have started all five games this season - jobs now in jeopardy.\n\nBeach has been dealing with injuries all season and is expected to be replaced by sophomore Sam Garvin.\n\nMark Stickford, who took over for the injured McCann against TCU, has moved ahead of Criddle on the most recent depth chart though Brohm said he plans to use both in a rotation.\n\nRedshirt freshman Eric Miller will get a chance to supplant Bramel in practice this week and sophomore Marc Roland could challenge McCann.\n\n\u201cWe want to try to still have some competition but definitely try to maybe start to settle on some guys we feel good about,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cI think Grant has the most experience up front, him and Matt. Those two guys have to play well for us in order for us to do well.\u201d\n\nThe Boilermakers (1-4, 0-2 Big Ten) have lost three straight, are off to their worst start in Brohm\u2019s three seasons and are tied for the league lead in sacks allowed (16) with Minnesota.\n\nThey will need to win five of their final seven games to become bowl-eligible and they may have to do the bulk of that work without starting quarterback Elijah Sindelar, who is expected to be out until at least mid-November with a broken left collarbone he suffered when a Minnesota pass rusher drove him into the ground in Game 4.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear when All-American receiver Rondale Moore might return from a hamstring injury that kept him on the sideline last weekend.\n\nAnd Jack Plummer, Sindelar\u2019s replacement, could be trying to fend off Aidan O\u2019Connell for the starting job this week after Brohm noted Plummer occasionally held the ball too long against the Nittany Lions.\n\n\u201cJack competed extremely hard. He gave us great effort and he did some good things,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWhen you get hit that many times, you\u2019re going to struggle a little toward the end and we took a lot of sacks. So we just want to make sure there\u2019s competition at every position. I think Aidan is a guy that could play or he may not play, depending on how this week goes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Purdue's offensive line has been a major concern all season.
