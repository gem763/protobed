I immediately fell head over heels for her kind and thoughtful heart that radiates so much light.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Proposing in her very favorite place in the zoo, surrounded by animals, seemed like the perfect way to embark on this incredible new chapter in our lives.\n\n\"Bee, I love you more than anything in this world and I always will. Happy Birthday.\"\n\nHonouring Bindi's dad Steve Irwin\n\nThe couple plan to wed at Australia Zoo, first set up by Bindi's grandparents, and made famous by Steve, who died in 2006 after being pierced in the heart by a stingray.\n\nChandler said on Good Morning America: \"We're so excited. It's where we met and where we got engaged so it only makes sense that we'd have it at Australia Zoo.\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\n\"See, I think this wedding is going to be unique because it's going to be at the zoo with tons of animals.\"\n\nBindi also hinted that the animals the family adore will also be a huge part of the ceremony, and she will be holding a koala instead of the traditional flower bouquet.\n\nShe said: \"I'm not sure how many people have walked down the aisle with a koala, but we may be setting some new trends for weddings from here on out.\"\n\nBindi has talked about how important it was to honour her dad on the day.\n\n(Image: Twitter@BindiIrwin)\n\nSpeaking to the Sunshine Coast Daily, she said: \"I do really wish that dad was here to be able to celebrate with us as a family.\n\n\"I think in some ways he is and his spirit lives on in everything that we do, and I always feel closest to dad here at Australia Zoo.\"\n\nThe wild wedding location\n\nNewidea.com spoke to Trudy Croad, owner of Lovebird weddings, a company which has planned weddings at Australia Zoo.\n\nShe gave some hints as to what could be expected on Bindi and Chandler's wedding day.\n\nShe revealed that it's unlikely they would want to close the park early, so will head for an evening wedding - meaning it would be better in November, where it's summer in Australia.\n\n\"They could do a sunset ceremony\", said Trudy.\n\n\"They've got a beautiful elephant enclosure called Elephantasia. It's got an amazing waterfall which would make a really stunning ceremony backdrop.\"\n\nTrudy thinks they will want to include their beloved elephant in the ceremony.\n\n\"Unfortunately they [recently] lost their third elephant cub. I know for Bindi there would be an emotional connection to that enclosure.\n\n\"Then you'd get all the guests onto a train and take them down to the African Savannah and that\u2019s where you've got this amazing open-plan space with palm trees.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"A lot of those animals are put back at 5pm, but I think the cheetahs will still roam through that area.\"\n\nTrudy even suggested the sustainability-focused couple might send out their invitations made from elephant poo.\n\nShe said: \"Both Bindi and Chandler are the ultimate in everything being sustainable and recyclable, so from every element of their day, they're going to really want that to come true. And that could start from the very beginning.\n\n\"Elephant poo makes the most beautiful recycled wedding invitation paper. So they could use the elephant poo they have on site to make their invitations.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram/bindisueirwin)\n\nBindi's stunning wedding dress\n\nBindi has now also revealed a teaser for what her wedding dress looks like.\n\nOn her Instagram, she posted a photo of her wearing the dress - but all that can be seen is an elegant long lacy white sleeve.\n\nShe captioned the photo, \"I said yes to the dress\", leading to speculation that her selection process might have been filmed for TLC's Say Yes To The Dress.\n\n(Image: bindisueirwin/Instagram)\n\nChandler commented on the post: \"I can't wait.\n\n\"You're going to be so beautiful.\"\n\nThe wedding ceremony\n\nAs part of her wedding plans, Bindi will have brother Robert, 15, walk her down the aisle in place of her dad,.\n\nShe wrote a touching Instagram post that said: \"Dad, You would be so incredibly proud of Robert.\n\n\"He has been such an amazing support during this beautiful new life chapter.\n\n(Image: AFP)\n\n\"I know you\u2019d be beaming with pride when the time comes that he walks me down the aisle. I wish you could be here for these moments, but I know that your spirit lives on in us.\"\n\nRobert recently retweeted the image that Bindi had shared of her wedding dress, writing: \"Can't wait to walk you down the aisle.\"\n\nPlus, Bindi's mum Terri will step in for Steve for the traditional father-daughter dance.\n\n(Image: WENN.com)\n\nAs for the dancefloor, Trudy thinks it will be an outdoor space so guests can see the stars.\n\n\"They can't go with a marquee with a white cover. With an area like Australia Zoo, it's got to be clear, you've got to see the stars above you,\" she said.\n\n\"She's going to have a big outdoor dance floor \u2013 she won Dancing With the Stars! A dance floor with overhead lights would be stunning.\"", "description": "A closer look at Bindi Irwin's wedding plans as she marries childhood sweetheart Chandler Powell in a wild ceremony that honours their beloved animals", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Bindi Irwin Instagram", "Instagram", "Rex", "Twitter Bindiirwin", "Getty", "Instagram Bindisueirwin", "Bindisueirwin Instagram", "Afp"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article5818498.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Bindi-Irwin-poses-with-a-Koala.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
