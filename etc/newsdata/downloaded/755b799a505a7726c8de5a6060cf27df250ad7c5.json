Williams. Lyles and his brother Josephus visited the school in Alexandria on Thursday. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThursday afternoon after school, Naol Gurmu sat among track and cross-country teammates in the front row of the T.C. Williams gymnasium bleachers and raised his hand. Noah Lyles pointed at Gurmu, a freshman cross-country runner, signaling it was his turn. \u201cDid you bring your medals with you?\u201d Gurmu asked.\n\nOnly four years ago, Lyles, 22, had been one of the kids sitting in the bleachers before him. Now, he walked to the side wall and grabbed a blue box. It contained one of the gold medals Lyles had won earlier this month at the IAAF world championships in Doha, Qatar. Lyles handed it to Gurmu and lifted off the top. \u201cOoooooh!\u201d rang a chorus of teenagers. They pulled out phones to take pictures. Lyles instructed them to pass it around as he continued answering questions with his brother, Josephus, a fellow T.C. Williams alum and track professional.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Gurmu said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to describe it.\u201d\n\nLyles returned to his alma mater after the greatest moment of a career in full ascent. Lyles won two gold medals at his first world championships, pulling away for victory in the 200 meters, his best event, and running the anchor leg in the 4x100 relay as the American men set a national record and ended a 12-year skid without major championship gold in the event.\n\nThe performance validated the widely held belief that Lyles, with a potential challenge likely to come from relay teammate and 100 meters world champion Christian Coleman, is the future of American men\u2019s track and field and perhaps the sport\u2019s brightest global star leading into the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n[Noah Lyles could be the star track and field needs]\n\nLyles\u2019s life had been a whirlwind since he won the relay gold medal. He stayed up until 4 a.m. that night between media obligations and treatment, then rose hours later for another round of interviews. He had just returned to his Clermont, Fla., home. Josephus was coming to Alexandria, where the brothers moved before high school, to see specialists to treat nagging injuries. It was Noah Lyles\u2019s idea to join him and visit his old school, where he visited with former coaches and teachers and saw a case filled with trophies and medals he had won.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you need a little bit of nostalgia,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cOr you need somebody to celebrate [with]. The greatest part about having family there at the world championships after you race is having somebody to connect with that knows what you went through and has seen you work as hard as you have. It\u2019s that connection you want to gravitate to.\u201d\n\nThe two finals in which he earned gold medals were entirely different experiences. Lyles, an avid connoisseur of Japanese anime, dyed his hair silver for the 200 final, a nod to the Dragon Ball Z character Goku. When Goku reaches his final form, called Ultra Instinct, his hair turns silver. As his name was announced before he settled into the starting blocks, Lyles reached both hands into the sky. He then pulled his fists to his chest and howled, mimicking, he said, when Goku learned the Spirit Bomb.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like one of his most powerful moves,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cAnd it is basically him asking for energy from all beings, organisms, in the universe.\u201d\n\nLyles was even with two competitors around the turn, but he pulled away for a comfortable victory. Lyles is an irrepressible extrovert, and typically he exudes joy after a victory \u2014 or even, as was the case when Michael Norman edged him in a Diamond League race this summer, a close loss. When he crossed in Doha, he closed his eyes, slowed and dropped to his knees.\n\n\u201cIt was me being out of energy, to be honest,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cIt was me being on my last few legs. These were my last efforts. This was everything I had. When I cross that line, I do usually have a lot of energy. I\u2019ve imagined how that race would go after I won tons of times. That was the last thing on the list of how I thought I would end it.\u201d\n\n[Archives: High school sprinters Noah and Josephus Lyles are bolting toward the Rio Olympics]\n\nLyles had been aiming for these world championships for the past year. In 2017, a hamstring injury cost him the chance to compete. While he had been recognized as one of the world\u2019s fastest men, he had yet to claim a major title. When he bagged one in his signature event, he felt relief.\n\n\u201cPhysically, mentally, emotionally, I was pushing everything to track and field,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cIn sci-fi terms, if you\u2019re on a spaceship and you\u2019re like, \u2018I need all powers on the shields!\u2019 It was like that.\u201d\n\nLyles\u2019s triumph in the 4x100, captured with Coleman, Justin Gatlin and Michael Rodgers, was a different form of celebration. He crossed the line screaming, with his right index finger in the air. After crossing the line, Lyles ran straight to Coleman for a flying chest bump. After both sprinters mugged for separate camera, they found one another again. Coleman grabbed the top of the baton as Lyles gripped the bottom half, and Lyles threw his arm around Coleman.\n\n\n\nNoah Lyles, right, and Christian Coleman celebrate after the U.S. team won the 4x100-meter relay earlier this month at Doha, Qatar.

They are 22 and 23 years old, respectively, and the consensus declares them the two fastest men on the planet. They will likely run the first and final legs of the 4x100 relay at the Olympics in Tokyo next summer. They approach the sport in different ways: Lyles want to transcend track and radiates exuberance; Coleman is all business and has shared little of himself with the public.\n\nThe personality difference has led to tension. After Lyles upset Coleman in a 100 final in the spring, he declared it the start of his reign. Coleman took umbrage on social media. Lyles told an NBC Sports reporter their relationship was \u201cnot good.\u201d After winning a title together, Lyles remains uncertain of how Coleman views him.\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Lyles said, laughing. \u201cStraight up. I have no idea if it changed anything. I\u2019m as much curious as everybody else.\u201d\n\nBut what about how he views their relationship?\n\n\u201cI felt like it really well,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cI felt like we were really friends. I actually loved looking at the pictures of the 4x100 ending. When me and Christian chest-bumped each other, we\u2019re both looking back, we\u2019re both hype as a mug, we\u2019re looking at the camera. I love those pictures. Those are some of my favorite pictures to look at.\n\n\u201cNot everybody is best friends. That\u2019s just life. Some people you have a relationship that\u2019s like an arm\u2019s length, and some people you\u2019re really close with, and some people you\u2019re just on a hi-bye basis.\u201d\n\nWhat mattered was that Coleman and Lyles won together. On Thursday, Lyles brought the medals back to his school. He posed for pictures with students and held a Q&A with Josephus for students on the track and field and cross-country teams.\n\nLyles will shift his focus to Tokyo, where he aims to add the 100 \u2014 and a third gold medal \u2014 to his program. Having run the 200 in 19.50 seconds this year, Lyles could challenge Bolt\u2019s record of 19.19 seconds by then. \u201cI don\u2019t put it past me,\u201d Lyles said.\n\nFor all he has accomplished, Lyles still has so much ahead of him, only four years removed from walking the T.C. Williams halls as a high schooler. One student offered a reminder, asking how he made it to the Olympics.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t made it to the Olympics yet,\u201d Lyles replied, smiling.\n\n\n\nNoah Lyles donates one of his trophies for his former coach, Michael Hughes, left, during his visit to T.C.
