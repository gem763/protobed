He is physically way better than what we've had him the last two years,\" said co-trainer Paul Snowden ahead of the race. \"He just looks outstanding.\"\n\nThe draw to decide which horse is placed in which starting gate was conducted in breathtaking fashion with the jockey's colors beamed onto Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nThe light show was good news for Redzel's connections with the two-time champion drawn in Gate 7, which should give him a fair chance of another victory.\n\nKerrin McEvoy on Redzel after winning The Everest at Royal Randwick Racecourse.\n\nStyle\n\nUnlike Royal Ascot , there is no strict dress code for the majority of spectators at the racecourse but people are encouraged to dress in their finest.\n\nOnly those entering the members' areas are required to abide by rules, with men having to wear tailored suits and women asked to adhere to the \"dignity and tradition\" of the event.\n\nThis year also sees another exciting addition to the Carnival, with the first running of Australia's second richest race.\n\nThe Golden Eagle will be run at the nearby Rosehill Gardens on the following weekend and boasts a prize pot of $7.5 million -- more than the $5.3 million Melbourne Cup.", "description": "History will be made this weekend as 12 of the planet's fastest horses battle it out in the world's richest race on turf.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191016130009-everest-tease-2-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
