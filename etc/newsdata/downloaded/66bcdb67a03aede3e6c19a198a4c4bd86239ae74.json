Among the standouts are two large paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat, which will be the star lots of Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s evening sales.\n\nThis year\u2019s Frieze London features more than 160 of the world\u2019s leading galleries, representing over 1,000 leading artists.\n\nCoinciding with Frieze Week, major international auction houses, including Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s, Phillips, and Bonhams, will host exhibitions, day sales, and evening sales of post-war and contemporary art.\n\nChristie\u2019s will kick off the Frieze Week with an evening sale on Oct. 1 dedicated to the collection of Jeremy Lancaster. A distinguished collector and former chairman of Wolseley, the world\u2019s largest distributor of heating and plumbing products, Lancaster died in April at age 83.\n\nThe 54-lot collection includes masterpieces by British artists Bridget Riley and Howard Hodgkin, as well as top-quality works by American artists, says Tessa Lord, head of evening auctions at Christie\u2019s in London.\n\nPolke's 1967 Alpenveilchen/Flowers Courtesy of Christie's\n\nThe evening auction on Oct. 4 will be led by Basquiat\u2019s 1982 Four Big, a large-scale painting structured like a devotional triptych. The painting brings together echoes of religion, royalty, ancient history, anatomical drawing, music, and the daily news, centered around Basquiat\u2019s famous crown icon. It\u2019s estimated to sell for between \u00a37.5 million and \u00a39.5 million (US$9.3 million-US$11.8 million).\n\n\u201cWhat really defines the evening auction is that it showcases artists who pioneered new directions for the medium of paint ranging, from Sigmar Polke's dotted raster technique to Gerhard Richter's \u2018Abstraktes Bild' series,\u201d Lord says.\n\nPolke\u2019s 1967 Alpenveilchen/Flowers has a high estimate of \u00a37 million while Richter\u2019s 1984 Abstraktes Bild (559-1) is expected to fetch up to \u00a39.5 million.\n\nAt Sotheby\u2019s, Basquiat\u2019s 1984 Pyro will highlight its evening auction of contemporary art on Oct. 3, with an estimate in the region of \u00a39 million. The large painting, measuring 68 by 86 inches, depicts an electrifying scene of urban chaos with graffiti-like figures, silkscreened animals, architectural shrines, and curious scientific models converge and collide with dizzying force.\n\nAnother highlight of Sotheby\u2019s Frieze Week evening auction is Banksy\u2019s largest known oil-on-canvas, Devolved Parliament, which is expected to net between \u00a31.5 million and \u00a32 million.\n\nDavid Hockney's Bridlington Studio Interior could fetch up to 1.2 million at Sotheby's evening auction of contemporary art in London. Courtesy of Sotheby's\n\nPhillips\u2019 43-lot evening auction of 20th century and contemporary art on Oct. 4 will be led by Hurvin Anderson's Beaver Lake, with an estimate of between \u00a31.5 million and \u00a32 million. The painting offers a loose pictorial take on the Albertan lake that Anderson\u2019s sister visited when she emigrated to Canada from the U.K., according to Phillips.\n\nFemale portraiture will be a focal point at Phillips, including Simone Leigh's 2013 structural work, Shower Cap; Tschabalala Self\u2019s 2015 Florida, both of which have a high estimate of \u00a360,000; and Alex Katz's 1972 Blue Umbrella, with a high estimate of \u00a31.2 million.\n\nBonhams\u2019 evening auction of post-war and contemporary art on Oct. 3 will feature pieces from the collection of John J. Studzinski, a British-American philanthropist and managing director of the global investment-management firm PIMCO.\n\nLeading the pack is British artist Chris Ofili's 2005 mixed media work Blind Leading Blind, expected to realize \u00a3120,000. Chinese-French painter Zao Wou-ki\u2019s 1995 Sans Titre has a high estimate of \u00a380,000, while French artist Jean Dubuffet's 1948 Deux B\u00e9douins has a presale estimate of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a370,000.", "description": "The sales are timed with next month's Frieze Week London", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-108439/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
