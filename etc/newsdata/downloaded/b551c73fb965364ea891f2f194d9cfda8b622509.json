A month passed and the caretaker received neither, so he decided to file a police report.\n\nThe caretaker has since been arrested. Police did not say whether the man had a license to own a pet lion or if the lion was still being cared for by the individual or if it had been moved to a zoo.", "description": "The caretaker of a Pakistani house of worship unleashed his pet lion on an electrician who was trying to collect late payment, local police say.", "authors": ["Adeel Raja"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191017112939-shahdra-map-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
