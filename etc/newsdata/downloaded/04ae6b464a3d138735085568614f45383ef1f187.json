Previous studies have been small, or short-term.\n\nIn this research, called Cloudy with a Chance of Pain, scientists recruited 2,500 people with arthritis, fibromyalgia, migraine and neuropathic pain from across the UK.\n\nThey recorded pain symptoms each day, for between one and 15 months, while their phones recorded the weather where they were.\n\nDamp and windy days with low pressure increased the chances of experiencing more pain than normal by about 20%.\n\nSo if someone's chances of a painful day with average weather were five in 100, they would increase to six in 100 on a damp and windy day.\n\nCold, damp days also made pain worse.\n\nBut there was no association with temperature alone, or rainfall.\n\n'Pain forecast'\n\nProf Will Dixon, of the Centre for Epidemiology Versus Arthritis, at the University of Manchester, who led the study said: \"Weather has been thought to affect symptoms in patients with arthritis since [ancient Greek physician] Hippocrates.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"Around three-quarters of people living with arthritis believe their pain is affected by the weather.\"\n\nProf Dixon said if other researchers could now \"look at why humidity is related to pain, that opens the door to new treatments\".\n\nAnd it might be possible to develop a \"pain forecast\" that could allow people with chronic pain to plan activities.\n\nAbout 10 million people in the UK have arthritis - and most of them are thought to experience life-altering pain every day.\n\nDr Stephen Simpson, director of research at Versus Arthritis, which funded the study, said: \"It's been almost folklore that weather has an effect on arthritis - but that's all been people's 'lived experiences' rather than studies.\n\n\"This was an innovative way to do research and it's very important that we have been able to draw some conclusions.\"", "description": "Researchers hope the study will steer work into why those with long-term health issues are affected.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/144DC/production/_109346138_humidity.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
