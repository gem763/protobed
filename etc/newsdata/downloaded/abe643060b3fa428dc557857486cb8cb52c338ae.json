They should not be confused with collection-box-rattling volunteers.\n\nPreferred option: More than eight in ten people polled by social enterprise Give As You Live Online say email is their preferred method of contact by charities\n\nThe findings will be of little surprise to many people who have run the gauntlet of chuggers while out shopping. Six in ten say this type of fundraising sends a 'negative, desperate signal', making them feel uncomfortable.\n\nInstead, people are looking for convenience when they donate to good causes.\n\nThis has been helped by the growth of fundraising platforms such as JustGiving and Virgin Money Giving, as well as donating via text message with deductions taken via phone bills.\n\nBut another trend to emerge is charitable cashback shopping websites. Standard cashback websites pay rebates to online shoppers for a wide range of purchases from well-known brands \u2013 anything from clothes to signing up to a new broadband provider. Cashback earnings can be impressive, reaching hundreds of pounds a year.\n\nWith charitable versions of such websites \u2013 easyfundraising and TheGivingMachine \u2013 rebates are sent directly to the charity rather than a shopper's back pocket.\n\nWebsite TopCashback, where money typically goes to customers, also has an option that allows customers to donate its rewards directly to charities.\n\nGive As You Live Online has raised more than \u00a310million this way for 200,000 charities in the last decade.\n\nOptions: With charitable versions of such websites \u2013 easyfundraising and TheGivingMachine \u2013 rebates are sent directly to the charity rather than a shopper's back pocket\n\nDirector Annabelle Risdon says: 'Our research indicates that in-your-face chugging, intrusive telephone calls and physical post is now considered 'social spam' to the degree that it can harm the reputation and fundraising potential of the charities involved.\n\n'We've seen a desire to fundraise with the least amount of fuss, fanfare or public recognition.'\n\nAnother convenient way to give is via 'payroll giving'. This allows employees to donate directly from wages each month, even low sums, before tax is deducted. Employers need to be signed up to a scheme to take part, but there has been an increase in uptake this year.\n\nIndividuals keen to give this way should ask their payroll or human resources departments whether the company is signed up, or is considering such a move.\n\nMore information at gov.uk/payroll-giving.", "description": "More than eight in ten people polled by social enterprise Give As You Live Online say email is their preferred method of contact by charities over any other, including social media.", "authors": ["Laura Shannon For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
