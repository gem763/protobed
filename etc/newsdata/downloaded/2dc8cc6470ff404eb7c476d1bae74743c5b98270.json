The energy generated from the microbial fuel cells is transmitted to the computer and you can see the individual cells and the amount of voltage that are generated,\u201d explained Tosin Obata, Research Associate, Bristol Bioenergy Centre.\n\nProf Ioannis Ieropoulos, Bristol Uni BioEnergy Centre, has demonstrated novel electrical power from human urine pic.twitter.com/9d3an9t2ah \u2014 Shewee-inal (@Sheweeinal) February 3, 2017\n\nRock the toilet\n\nThe environmentally-conscious Glastonbury music festival was the ideal place to test the technology.\n\nSo in 2015 and 2016 the team from the Bristol BioEnergy Centre built outdoor toilets on the festival site to harness the power of urine.\n\nWith the festival attended by approximately 175,000 people over five days, it was a great opportunity to collect a lot of urine.\n\nThe experiment also showed the urinals could be set up quickly, far away from the lab.\n\nOnce the urinals were erected, the scientists could invite the public to donate their urine and power the toilet lights.\n\nFestival goers queued up to donate their urine to Bristol\u2019s innovative scientists.\n\nThe benefits of urine are many. Not only does the microbial fuel cell create electricity, but it cleans the waste in the process.\n\nStress tests\n\nThe scientists put microbial fuel cells in a number of different stress conditions to test it. It can work above ground, below ground, in hot or cold conditions and day or night.\n\n\u201cWe have been putting the technology to the test, with things like recharging mobile phones, that\u2019s a very clear example of how that would work, but also integrating the microbial fuel cell in urinals, where we can collect urine, and having the lights of the urinal powered by those microbial fuel cells directly.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a stand alone, self-powered urinal which can go in refugee camps, it can go in slums, it can go in informal settlements, anywhere where there\u2019s no infrastructure, there\u2019s no national grid,\u201d said Ioannis Ieropoulos, Director, Bristol Bioenergy Centre.\n\nOur Bristol Bioenergy Centre to take their pee power toilets to refugee camps \u2013 https://t.co/Ju5bOGikm6 \u2014 Research Events (@UWEresevents) August 4, 2016\n\nEach individual microbial fuel cell is very cheap to produce, costing a little under one euro, and is made of inexpensive materials such as ceramics and a carbon catalyst.\n\nWorking with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Oxfam, this year the technology is going to be set up in refugee camps at a handful of locations across Africa.", "description": "The Bristol BioEnergy Centre is working on bacteria which breaks down chemicals in urine releasing energy as electrons which turns into electricity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/357190/1000x563_357190.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-07"}
