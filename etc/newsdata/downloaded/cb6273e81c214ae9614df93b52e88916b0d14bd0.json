I had them with my first husband who I left 40 years ago. I\u2019ve been remarried for 38 years.\n\nOver the years, my sons have had moments when they\u2019ve refused to speak to me, but my second son took this a step further five years ago when he told me if I didn\u2019t stop talking to his son (with whom he\u2019d fallen out) he\u2019d cut me off.\n\nI tried to explain I loved both him and my grandson, and it was wrong of him to tell me who I can and can\u2019t talk to. He wouldn\u2019t listen and didn\u2019t invite us to our granddaughter\u2019s wedding, cutting us off completely.\n\nNow my husband has cancer (my son knows) and I would like my son to at least get in touch with him \u2013 he got on very well with him. But he\u2019s a very stubborn man and blames me for a lot of things that happened in his life.\n\nHis father was an abusive \u00adwomaniser. As a single mum, I made decisions I thought at the time were the right ones. It wasn\u2019t easy, but I did my best. Do you have any advice?\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nColeen says:\n\nIt sounds as if he\u2019s punishing you for everything that\u2019s gone wrong in his life. I\u2019m sure every decision you made all those years ago was made with good intent and you did the right thing getting out of an abusive relationship.\n\nSome people need to find someone to blame for what goes wrong in their life because they can\u2019t look inward and take responsibility. Of course, past experiences shape you and it can\u2019t have been easy for your boys when they were children.\n\nHowever, while there might be a reason for your son\u2019s behaviour rooted in his past, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an excuse to punish others.\n\nAs an adult, he can make the choice to deal with those issues in a way that helps him and doesn\u2019t destroy his important relationships \u2013 through therapy for example.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIt\u2019s sad he\u2019s dragged your grandchildren into it, but I don\u2019t think you should stop talking to them \u2013 they\u2019re old enough to find the truth and make up their own minds. It\u2019s wrong to blackmail you into cutting ties with your grandson.\n\nIf you feel you\u2019ve done everything you can to reach out to him \u2013 putting your thoughts in a letter, for example \u2013 then you might have to leave the ball in his court and hope he gets in touch with you or your husband.\n\nIt sounds as if he\u2019s isolating himself from the family one by one and I hope he doesn\u2019t end up living with regret as that\u2019s a very painful place to be.", "description": "A worried grandmother asks for advice as her stubborn son blames her for what has gone wrong in his life", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Getty Images", "Itv", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20524876.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Older-woman-with-hand-on-face-looks-sad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
