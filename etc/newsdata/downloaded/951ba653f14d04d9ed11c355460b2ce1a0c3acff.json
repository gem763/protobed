And unfortunately, the incident led to them getting a little more physical than we would like to see.\"\n\nBurnaby North Secondary School Principal Dave Rawnsley said students need to be respectful of each other's opinions. (Mike Zimmer/CBC)\n\nA young male student who disagreed with the pro-Hong Kong poster is seen on the video shoving a female student. It's unclear what happened in the moments before the recording began.\n\nBut afterwards, a female student can been heard speaking to the young man in the video.\n\n\"Relax, it's okay. It's Canada. You can have your opinions. We can have our opinions. We'll just leave each other alone. We have not physically attacked you guys,\" she said.\n\nRawnsley said staff broke up the argument, and have spoken to the four students involved as well as their parents. He would not say if any of the students have been disciplined.\n\n\"The message we want to [send to] parents and kids is that school needs to be a safe place for all kids, needs to be a place where they can be physically safe but also safe to express their opinions.\"", "description": "A high school student at Burnaby North Secondary was yelled at and pushed by another student for putting a pro-Hong Kong poster on her locker.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308585.1570221356!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/burnaby-north-secondary-school.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
