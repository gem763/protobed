She makes manicotti. She makes it al dente with-a ricotta cheese,' one wrote.\n\n'When the meat-a-ball-as are just spicy enough,' another tweet read, making it appear as if AOC was rubbing her fingers in glee.\n\nHowever, one person interpreted the image as if the Bronx-born politician was in a rather bad mood.\n\nThey claimed AOC's facial expression reminded them of their Italian mom angrily saying 'After everything I've done for you, this is how you repay me?'\n\nAOC is known for being active on Twitter, but the Congresswoman - who has no Italian heritage - has not yet addressed the humorous memes.", "description": "The snap, which shows the 30-year-old raising her hands in the air and rubbing her fingers together, has sparked the hashtag #ItalianAOC.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/21/20392772-0-image-a-24_1572471300771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
