You're pushing the needle to the right. Those lyrics from \"It Can Happen\" on Yes' seminal 1983 album 90125, aptly convey the experience of running a proprietary trading fund. Since I began trading for my new firm, Excelsior Capital Partners, in July, I have learned to embrace (or re-embrace, in my case, I have done this before) the volatility in the current markets.\n\nI have also learned a few things in the past six months and I will share them with you here.\n\n1. Watch the futures. If you think there is a giant sigh of relief among position traders when the markets close at 4 pm ET each day, you would be dead wrong. The futures markets of the CME close for all of one hour, from 5 pm-6 pm ET each weekday. Also, late trading in individual stocks - my bailiwick - occurs from 4 pm-8 pm ET every weekday on a variety of different exchanges.\n\nSo, as Yogi used to say, 'it ain't over 'til it's over'. If you are trading stocks, or even more importantly, options (also my forte) you had better keep your investing apps (I use investing.com but there are many others) on the front screen of your phone.\n\nThe stock is up after hours and you were long? Nice call, but you had better know exactly what the CFO said on the conference call, and don't ever disconnect after management's prepared remarks. As a long time sell-side analyst, I can tell you that it is the Q&A in which the magic happens for most quarterly earnings conference calls.\n\n2. Don't play around. So, in the scenario I just described, an investor would have to pay attention to individual stock quotes until at least 5:30 pm Eastern time, take a short break for evening activities, and start to check the futures when the Asian markets open at 8 pm-9 pm ET.\n\nIf that seems like a lot of work to you, it's simply because it is a lot of work. That's why Wall Street professionals are highly compensated. Something has to offset the stress.\n\nIt absolutely boggles my mind when financial pundits advise buying single stocks for individual investors without giving them the tools to analyze those investments. I have been staring at those little red and green flickers on the screen for nearly 30 years now. I have not yet figured out how to predict them accurately, but I am right more often than I am wrong.\n\nIf you want to practice buy-and-hold with names with strong, established fundamentals, that's fine. Also sticking within the somewhat friendly confines of ETFs or the watered-down offerings in the average 401k is not a bad strategy. The stock market has certainly risen more often than it has fallen (on a daily, monthly or annually basis) and that strategy is quite logical. The moment you step away from that, however, you had better be prepared to devote most of your waking hours to follow the markets or you will lose money. This is not a game!\n\n3. Live to play another day. In these wacky markets, where the tone of the markets can, and has, changed with one tweet, you have to understand that active positions will decline in value. It happens. Set limit orders and focus on your batting average. Sticking with positions for too long, especially when you prefer to write (i.e., short) options contracts, as I do, can be fatal. Take your losses and concentrate on learning from those short-term losses to produce long-term winning gains.\n\nSo, those are few talking points heading into the Labor Day weekend. I have pointed out in many RM columns that stocks are overvalued (especially certain tech sectors) and the marginal move in global economic growth is down, which is certainly not reflected in the inflated valuations of stocks in the world's markets. Keep pushing the needle to the right and you will make money on the short side in these markets.
