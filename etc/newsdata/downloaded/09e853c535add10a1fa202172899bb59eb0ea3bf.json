Two years ago, I started the \u2018Need to Impeach\u2019 movement because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennysylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe did have the most corrupt president in the country and that only the voice and will of the American people who drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency.\u201d\n\nSteyer then claimed the American people are what motivate him in calling for the impeachment of President Trump.\n\n\u201cSo, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding,\u201d Steyer added. \u201cThey\u2019re the voice that counts and that\u2019s who I went to.
