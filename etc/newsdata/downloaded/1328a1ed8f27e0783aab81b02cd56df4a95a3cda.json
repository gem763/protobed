But they did not learn about her full condition until after her birth.\n\n\"We knew something was wrong when we went in for a routine anatomy ultrasound at 26 weeks and what should have taken 45 minutes, ended up lasting a nerve-wracking two hours,'' Brush told PEOPLE. \"It was then that the doctor told us that they couldn\u2019t find all ten fingers and diagnosed the baby with oligodactyly (having fewer than 10 fingers). Although this was better than expected, it was still heartbreaking news.\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

I was freaking out.\"\n\nThe couple, who also have a 2-year-old son, Axel, was admittedly hesitant to publicly speak about Evie's condition.\n\n\"We felt not being open would be even worse and make Evie feel ashamed for something that makes her all the more special in our eyes,'' she wrote on Instagram.\n\nEvie is healthy in every other way aside from the bone malformations, according to Brush, but her long-term future is a concern to the couple.\n\n\"How will she be at 70 years old?\" Brush said. \"Will this come back and haunt her? There\u2019s still a lot of unknowns, which is hard.\"\n\nThe family has made a choice to share her story as she learns to live with FATCO syndrome.\n\n\"As a family, we have decided to be open as we walk through this journey,'' Brush wrote on Instagram. \"We want Evie to always feel pride in who she is, and all that God gave her!\"", "description": "Maddie Brown Brush of \"Sister Wives\" shared her 2-month-old baby daughter has a rare genetic syndrome in which bones in her extremities do not develop.", "authors": ["Scott Stump"], "top_image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_43/1497907/sister-wives-daughter-has-birth-defect-today-square-191023_3f08eea055a4afe44c37f009ee197046.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
