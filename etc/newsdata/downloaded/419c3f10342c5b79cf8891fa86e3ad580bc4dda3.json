He\u2019s a Hockey Hall of Famer who captained two teams to the Stanley Cup with Type 1 diabetes. As a hockey player with diabetes, Domi was so inspired by the chance encounter with Clarke that he is trying to do the same thing for the next generation of kids trying to make the NHL despite the complications that come with the disease.\n\n\u201cWhat him taking a minute out of his day and sharing his story did for me, I was like, \u2018Man, if I ever make the NHL or have an opportunity to help kids out, I want to do the same thing,\u2019\u201d Domi said. \u201cI started out meeting with kids and sharing my story and talking to them and trying to motivate them like, \u2018Listen, whatever you want to do in life, you can still do despite having diabetes.\u2019\u201d\n\nDomi is now in his fourth NHL season and second with the Montreal Canadiens. His book, \u201cNo Days Off,\u201d comes out Oct. 29 and encapsulates in print what the 24-year-old does to play hockey with diabetes and the lessons he tries to deliver to children.\n\n\u201cI never say what they should do, ever. I just tell them what I\u2019ve done, what\u2019s worked, what hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d Domi said. \u201cI meet with kids almost after every game. That\u2019s just how it is. I like doing it. I enjoy doing it. I take pride in it. I want to keep doing it and growing from that and finding ways to raise money and awareness for something that I deal with on a daily basis and I can relate to a lot of kids out there.\u201d\n\nDomi\u2019s journey was jumpstarted by Clarke, who was diagnosed at 13 when growing up in Manitoba.\n\nLike Domi, he was much more focused on staying on the ice than how diabetes would affect the rest of his life.\n\n\u201cI said to the doctor who had diagnosed me and was looking after me, \u2018I\u2019ll still be able to play hockey, eh?\u2019\u201d Clarke said. \u201cAnd he said, yeah. He said, \u2018You might want to think of playing goal. It might be easier on you.\u2019 That thought never crossed my mind. \u2026 I just said, well I\u2019m going to play hockey.\u201d\n\nClarke continued to play center and put up 1,210 points over 15 seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers. He didn\u2019t really think about becoming a goaltender.\n\nNeither Domi nor Clarke remembers what the conversation went like that day at the rink 11 years ago. But if it\u2019s anything close to what has gone through Clarke\u2019s mind for the past half-century, it was a pretty clear message.\n\n\u201cDiabetes was no reason to not play hockey,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to live with it, and if you\u2019re going to be a hockey player then be a hockey player. It can\u2019t be an excuse not for playing.\u201d\n\nDomi goes through a 24-hour routine to play each game and knows he has the benefit of modern technology that Clarke lacked in the 1960s, \u201870s and early \u201880s. Despite all that, Clarke recalls only twice - once in juniors and once in training camp - where he felt the effects of diabetes because he \u201cgot stupid and didn\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was fairly simple in those days,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThere was only one type of insulin. You couldn\u2019t test your own blood sugars and stuff. Not like they can today. The equipment they have today is so much advanced. In those days, I took a needle in the morning and tried to balance the food out the best I could with the insulin that I was taking. I\u2019m sure that my blood sugars must\u2019ve run high - fairly high, I don\u2019t know how high.\u201d\n\nClarke keeps track of Domi\u2019s career and remembers the standard he held himself to years ago.\n\n\u201cThe thing for me that I always told myself is that I\u2019m a hockey player with diabetes. I am not a diabetic hockey player,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cSo diabetes cannot be an excuse for my performance, and it can\u2019t be an excuse for his performance.\u201d\n\nDomi, with 207 points in 304 regular-season games, is doing just fine. But each day is a constant reminder of the challenges ahead and the impact he can make.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s days where I feel sorry for myself, just like everyone does - \u2018it\u2019s not fair, why me\u2019 kind of thing,\u201d Domi said. \u201cI\u2019m like, what am I talking about? This is awesome. Let\u2019s turn this into a positive. Let\u2019s make this like a blessing in disguise and use all the positives that come with being a type 1, the responsibilities that come with it, and drive me to achieve my dreams of playing in the NHL. And that\u2019s kind of where it goes.\u201d\n\nPAVELSKI\u2019S SLOW START\n\nJoe Pavelski recorded one secondary assist in his first three games with the Dallas Stars since signing a $21 million, three-year contract. Change is hard, and the longtime Sharks forward is quickly realizing he\u2019s not in San Jose anymore.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of simple adjustments,\u201d Pavelski said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely natural. But it\u2019s at a good spot where I feel it\u2019s right there, right around the corner. Just keep going, get a little production and you get that confidence to really kind of take it to another level.\u201d\n\nDallas coach Jim Montgomery likened it to Hall of Fame pitcher Steve Carlton needing to get accustomed to new catchers when he moved around the majors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nuances of the game, of getting to know people, that comfort level of understanding when this guy has the puck, I go here, I\u2019m going to get the puck,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cThat just takes time.\u201d\n\nLEADERS (through Monday)\n\nGoals: Anthony Mantha (Detroit) and Auston Matthews (Toronto), 5; Assists: Matt Duchene (Nashville) and Morgan Rielly (Toronto), 5; Points: Mika Zibanejad (N.Y.
