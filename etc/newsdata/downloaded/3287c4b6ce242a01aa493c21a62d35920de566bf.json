Their approaches, whatever they prove to be, could shift with the season as the fortunes of players rise and fall with every touchdown or fumble.\n\n\u201cSome years we have a dilemma of deciding which Buckeye to celebrate,\u201d Jerry Emig, a spokesman for Ohio State, wrote in an email. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing! Waiting until season\u2019s end allows this decision to be decided at the grass roots/playing field level.\u201d\n\nLast December, for instance, Ohio State sent out a poster extolling Dwayne Haskins, its quarterback, on the day after the Big Ten championship game. The piece noted that Haskins had been the game\u2019s most valuable player \u2014 and included a dig or two at Kyler Murray, the Oklahoma quarterback, and Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama\u2019s quarterback, who were the Heisman favorites. (Murray won, followed by Tagovailoa and Haskins.)\n\nThis year, Wisconsin began mapping its strategy for Taylor by early June, when a group of athletic department employees convened to discuss parallel conundrums: how to help a tailback make a splash for an award that has, at least in the 21st century, tended to go to quarterbacks, and how to differentiate Taylor from other rushers.\n\nWisconsin officials called a handful of national reporters to hear their views of Taylor and to seed the university\u2019s arguments, which compare the junior\u2019s statistics to those of other celebrated tailbacks, including Dayne and Herschel Walker.\n\nIn meetings and memos, Wisconsin staff members discussed Taylor\u2019s strengths: \u201cvideo game-type numbers,\u201d name recognition and personality. Their goals were explicit: \u201cPosition him as a Heisman front-runner,\u201d and \u201cbreak through all the hype surrounding quarterbacks.\u201d\n\nThey settled on a plan that called for a blend of public and private efforts. While there would be a snazzy website, Wisconsin officials concluded, there would also be formal interviews, a few pull-aside meetings at Big Ten media days in Chicago and news conferences after games at Camp Randall Stadium. They believed their message needed to resonate in media markets beyond the Big Ten, knowing that people familiar with the conference had spent years watching Taylor hustle through defenses.", "description": "A look at a ground game that plays out away from the field, yet is important for universities chasing college football\u2019s top award.", "authors": ["Alan Blinder"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/sports/24Heisman-Illo/24Heisman-Illo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
