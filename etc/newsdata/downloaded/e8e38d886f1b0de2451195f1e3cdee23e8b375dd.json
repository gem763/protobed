(AP) - Melvin Gordon was flooded by familiar feelings after his delayed season debut with the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nNot many of those feelings were warm or fuzzy.\n\nInstead, the star fifth-year running back has been transported back to the bad old days of his first three NFL seasons when his Chargers fell into an early hole in the standings and spent the rest of the year scrambling to get out.\n\nLos Angeles (2-3) has a losing record after five games for the fourth time in Gordon\u2019s five seasons after its 20-13 loss to the previously winless Denver Broncos on Sunday. Even more embarrassingly, the Chargers failed to score an offensive touchdown for the first time since Dec. 13, 2015, ending a streak of 55 regular-season games.\n\nWhen asked if he recalled any early season games that left him feeling as frustrated as this debacle, Gordon smiled and replied: \u201cPlenty. But not for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get going,\u201d Gordon added. \u201cWhat frustrated me most was being inside the 20, being right at the goal line and not converting. That\u2019s just not Chargers football. You know us. We get to the goal line, we\u2019re licking our chops (and) we usually get it in.\u201d\n\nGordon ended his holdout late last month only to return to a once-familiar litany of missed opportunities, untimely mistakes and a late comeback that fell short. He rushed for just 31 yards on 12 carries and caught four passes for 7 yards.\n\nHis fellow running back, Austin Ekeler, had 15 receptions on numerous check-downs, but managed just 86 yards. According to NFL.com, Ekeler is the first player since 1950 to make at least 15 catches without gaining 100 yards.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Philip Rivers threw 48 passes that produced only 211 yards.\n\nThose high-volume, low-yield numbers epitomized the Chargers\u2019 frustrating offensive day against Denver. Los Angeles\u2018 only gain longer than 20 yards was Desmond King\u2019s 68-yard TD punt return.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an explosive offense,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the talent. It was just one of those days where nobody could get going. It\u2019s unfortunate, man. It\u2019s crazy with all the talent we have. \u2026 We\u2019re 2-3. It\u2019s a hole, but it ain\u2019t nothing we can\u2019t do if we play together. We\u2019ve got some guys out, but that\u2019s no excuse.\u201d\n\nRivers and his veteran teammates have grown used to spending the entire autumn making up for the mistakes of late summer, but that doesn\u2019t mean they like it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this boat a lot,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cObviously you don\u2019t want to be, but we have been. This exact group hasn\u2019t been, but a lot of us have. We\u2019ll see how this group responds collectively.\u201d\n\nMuch of the blame for the Chargers\u2019 offensive ineptitude could be laid squarely at the feet of their 37-year-old quarterback. The Bolts desperately needed a strong game from Rivers with several key teammates sidelined, their franchise running back fighting rust and their entire offense running out of sync even before center Mike Pouncey left with an injury.\n\nInstead, in his 213th consecutive regular-season start, Rivers failed to mount a touchdown drive in a game for only the eighth time in that stretch dating to 2006.\n\nRivers threw two interceptions, including a foolhardy throw late in the third quarter into double coverage in the end zone, where linebacker Alexander Johnson picked it off with ease. Rivers also committed a blatant intentional grounding penalty that pushed Los Angeles beyond rookie kicker Chase McLaughlin\u2019s field goal range in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThey had a good plan,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThey did a nice job. \u2026 It just wasn\u2019t going to be one of those 350-yard days where we were going to go up and down the field. I think I\u2019m going to look at it and go, \u2018Gosh.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Chargers repeatedly failed to pick up easy points, even in difficult situations. After coach Anthony Lynn decided to go for a touchdown from the Denver 1 on the final snap of the first half instead of taking a field goal with his team down 17-0, Ekeler fumbled while trying to stretch the ball over the goal line.\n\n\u201cMe and the 1-yard line, we have an interesting relationship,\u201d Ekeler said, recalling his fumble at the 1 in a similar situation during a loss at Detroit last month. \u201cWe got all the way down there, but we\u2019ve got to finish a drive. I don\u2019t know what it is. I honestly don\u2019t know. \u2026 It\u2019s frustrating, but you\u2019ve got to keep moving forward. We were getting chances. We just couldn\u2019t get any traction.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Melvin Gordon was flooded by familiar feelings after his delayed season debut with the Los Angeles Chargers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/broncos_chargers_football_02947_c0-168-4029-2517_s1770x1032.jpg?b62fc1b6d2c64fee0cd8e41f85a42f0f58d9c4a9", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
