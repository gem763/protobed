Ideally, that would all need to happen before the England series gets underway on December 26, but if not then the Proteas would continue with Nkwe at the helm.\n\n\"We're hoping to get this uncertainty out the way by the time the England tour happens,\" Van Zyl said.\n\n\"What we do know is that by the time that happens we will probably have a DOC in position already. If we haven't completed the Team Director process, then we still have an acting in place.\"\n\nWhen asked if CSA had identified anyone for the DOC role, Van Zyl replied: \"I have no idea ... I'm sure there are going to be very good people applying for this role, so he or she might have a totally different view to me.\"\n\nWhile Nkwe started his tenure with an encouraging 1-1 draw against India in their T20I series, the Test matches were as one-sided as you are ever likely to see.\n\nIt was, by all accounts, the most draining and testing of tours.\n\n\"We always knew it was going to be tough, but we all went there with expectations to do well and be competitive. It's tough and it hurts for the players and for Enoch,\" Van Zyl said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter how strong you are as a person, it's not nice losing. It's part of the experience and the development of a coach to work through those things.\n\n\"Having sat and discussed it with him (Nkwe), he is a person that looks forward based on the learnings that have gone past. He's not negative and he will be better for this experience.\"", "description": "The position of Director of Cricket will be filled as soon as possible by CSA as the proteas look to prepare for a visit from England at the end of the year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7347/dc884eda7a014b878e9828dc700d2023.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
