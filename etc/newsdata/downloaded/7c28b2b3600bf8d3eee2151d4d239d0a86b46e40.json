The master adapter of no fewer than five Agatha Christie novels is explaining her unique writing process. She is funny, vivacious, unapologetic.\n\nA stalwart of British drama, Phelps spices up Christie\u2019s work for the small screen at Christmas, from And Then There Were None to The ABC Murders \u2013 the latter of which saw Phelps add sexualised torture rituals into the plot, much to the horror of many purists.\n\nPhelps was also a writer on EastEnders for many years, with her most notable storyline being the death of Barbara Windsor\u2019s Peggy Mitchell. The beloved character, who had terminal cancer, died of an overdose after a visit from the ghost of Pat Butcher. Agatha Christie eat your heart out.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Phelps says when she first read French\u2019s work, she felt \u201cthat sensation of having a hook put in your mouth and getting pulled into the dark stream of a completely immersive world\u201d.\n\nThe series, which runs on BBC1 on Mondays and Tuesdays for the next four weeks, is a chilling, psychological mystery starring Killian Scott and Sarah Greene as detectives investigating two murders in Ireland. Despite first appearances, it is not a straightforward whodunit, which is why it appealed to Phelps. \u201cIt asks, \u2018What is at the centre of the tangle that is us?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe story just made my blood bang.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 40 best TV shows on Netflix UK 1/40 Bojack Horseman A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development\u2026 on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams \u201cmust watch\u201d. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack \u2013 one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin\u2019 Around \u2013 as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. Almost as good are a support cast including Alison Brie (Glow, Mad Men), Aaron Paul, of Breaking Bad, and Amy Sedaris as a pampered Persian cat who is also BoJack\u2019s agent. Season five touches the live rail of harassment in the movie industry, offering one of the most astute commentaries yet on the #MeToo movement with an episode based centred around an awards ceremony called \u201cThe Forgivies\u201d. Netflix 2/40 Stranger Things A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb \u2013 the \u201cbest friend\u201d character eaten in the second episode \u2013 went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix 3/40 Daredevil Netflix\u2019s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox\u2019s blind lawyer/crimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck's turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D'Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Netflix 4/40 The Staircase Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson \u2013 charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife \u2013 the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It\u2019s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Netflix 5/40 Dark Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix\u2019s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it\u2019s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it\u2019s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. Netflix 6/40 A Series of Unfortunate Events The wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let\u2019s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). Netflix 7/40 Maniac If you\u2019re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It\u2019s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a \u201ctravel buddy\u201d sit down and read you adverts. Stone and Hill are star-crossed outcasts participating in a drugs trial that catapults them into a series of trippy genre excursions \u2013 including an occult adventure and a Lord of the Rings-style fantasy. It is here that Fukunaga demonstrates his versatility, handling potentially hokey material smartly and respectfully. 007 fans can sleep easy. Netflix 8/40 Better Call Saul The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord\u2019s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? AMC Studios/Netflix 9/40 Black Mirror Don\u2019t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker\u2019s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash \u2013 yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story \"San Junipero\" and Star Trek parody \"USS Callister\", which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. Netflix 10/40 Mindhunter David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It\u2019s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders \u2013 including the notorious \u201cCo-Ed\u201d butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. Netflix 11/40 The Crown A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost / Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. Most impressive of all, arguably, is Claire Foy, who plays the Queen as a shy woman thrust unwillingly into the spotlight. Foy and the rest of the principal cast have now departed, with a crew of older actors \u2013 headed by Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies \u2013 taking over as the middle-aged Windsors for season three. Netflix 12/40 Narcos This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino\u2019s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix\u2019s biggest hits \u2013 the company doesn\u2019t release audience figures \u2013 the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico\u2019s interminable drugs wars. Juan Pablo Gutierrez/Netflix 13/40 Master Of None A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari\u2019s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. K.C. Bailey / Netflix 14/40 Bloodline One of Netflix\u2019s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan\u2019s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling \u2013 a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn\u2019t feel all that guilty about. Rod Millington/Netflix 15/40 The Alienist You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We\u2019re firmly in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Br\u00fchl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Kurt Iswarienko 16/40 Love Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs\u2019s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms \u2013 but Love\u2019s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there\u2019s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Netflix 17/40 Queer Eye Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs \u2013 but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. Netflix 18/40 Chef\u2019s Table A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef; across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. Charles Panian/Netflix 19/40 Arrested Development A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman \u201cmansplained\u201d away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix\u2019s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix 20/40 Altered Carbon Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new \u201cskins\u201d. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix\u2019s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel\u2019s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs. Netflix 21/40 Rick and Morty Dan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFly/Doc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon. Netflix/Adult Swim 22/40 GLOW Mad Men\u2019s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda \u201cBritannica\u201d Richardson. Netflix 23/40 Archer Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings. 24/40 Ozark Breaking Bad for those with short attention spans. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero\u2019s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family. Netflix 25/40 The Good Place A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto). Netflix 26/40 Disenchantment It\u2019s been forever and a few years since The Simpsons was even vaguely essentially viewing. But Matt Groening\u2019s Homer mojo clearly hasn\u2019t abandoned him yet. His Netflix series, just back for a second season, is a hilarious pastiche of fantasy tropes, with Abbi Jacobson as a hard-drinking princess, Eric Andre and Nat Faxon as her demon pal and elf sidekick and Matt Berry as \u2013 to quote Wikipedia \u2013 \u201cPrince Merkimer, from the kingdom of Bentwood, who is arranged to marry [Princess] Bean, but was turned into a pig\u201d. Netflix 27/40 Top Boy Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn\u2019t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane \u201cKano\u201d Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. Netflix 28/40 Unbelievable A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine expos\u00e9 of American justice\u2019s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody\u2019s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart\u2019s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Netflix 29/40 Russian Doll Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett. Netflix 30/40 The Umbrella Academy Gerard Way\u2019s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity\u2019s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R&B queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Netflix 31/40 When They See Us Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. Atsushi Nishijima/Netflix 32/40 The Dark Crystal This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom\u2026 a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander. 33/40 The Haunting of Hill House A rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan\u2019s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot \u2013 and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Steve Dietl/Netflix 34/40 The OA Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the \u201cmovements\u201d that permit travel across time and space. That\u2019s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons \u2013 and the mother of all cliff-hangers \u2013 the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? Netflix 35/40 Our Planet David Attenborough provides the narration \u2013 but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Netflix 36/40 The Dragon Prince Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it\u2019s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid\u2019s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery \u2013 there are dragons, elves and magicians \u2013 but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn \u2013 and did we mention the dragons? 37/40 Castlevania A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he\u2019s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. Netflix 38/40 Tuca and Bertie Netflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix\u2019s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of \u201cthe friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.\u201d The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats \u2013 specifically its depiction of the central relationship \u2013 yank the heartstrings. 39/40 Blown Away Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it\u2019s riveting viewing even if you can\u2019t tell a kiln from a kangaroo. 40/40 Dead to Me Linda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship \u2013 but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they\u2019d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series. Saeed Adyani / Netflix 1/40 Bojack Horseman A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development\u2026 on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams \u201cmust watch\u201d. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack \u2013 one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin\u2019 Around \u2013 as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. Almost as good are a support cast including Alison Brie (Glow, Mad Men), Aaron Paul, of Breaking Bad, and Amy Sedaris as a pampered Persian cat who is also BoJack\u2019s agent. Season five touches the live rail of harassment in the movie industry, offering one of the most astute commentaries yet on the #MeToo movement with an episode based centred around an awards ceremony called \u201cThe Forgivies\u201d. Netflix 2/40 Stranger Things A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb \u2013 the \u201cbest friend\u201d character eaten in the second episode \u2013 went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix 3/40 Daredevil Netflix\u2019s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox\u2019s blind lawyer/crimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck's turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D'Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Netflix 4/40 The Staircase Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson \u2013 charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife \u2013 the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It\u2019s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Netflix 5/40 Dark Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix\u2019s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it\u2019s a Wagner opera.

But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. K.C. Bailey / Netflix 14/40 Bloodline One of Netflix\u2019s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan\u2019s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling \u2013 a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn\u2019t feel all that guilty about. Rod Millington/Netflix 15/40 The Alienist You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We\u2019re firmly in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Br\u00fchl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Kurt Iswarienko 16/40 Love Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs\u2019s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms \u2013 but Love\u2019s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there\u2019s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Netflix 17/40 Queer Eye Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs \u2013 but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. Netflix 18/40 Chef\u2019s Table A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef; across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. Charles Panian/Netflix 19/40 Arrested Development A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman \u201cmansplained\u201d away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix\u2019s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix 20/40 Altered Carbon Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new \u201cskins\u201d. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix\u2019s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel\u2019s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs. Netflix 21/40 Rick and Morty Dan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFly/Doc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon. Netflix/Adult Swim 22/40 GLOW Mad Men\u2019s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda \u201cBritannica\u201d Richardson. Netflix 23/40 Archer Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings. 24/40 Ozark Breaking Bad for those with short attention spans. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero\u2019s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family. Netflix 25/40 The Good Place A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto). Netflix 26/40 Disenchantment It\u2019s been forever and a few years since The Simpsons was even vaguely essentially viewing. But Matt Groening\u2019s Homer mojo clearly hasn\u2019t abandoned him yet. His Netflix series, just back for a second season, is a hilarious pastiche of fantasy tropes, with Abbi Jacobson as a hard-drinking princess, Eric Andre and Nat Faxon as her demon pal and elf sidekick and Matt Berry as \u2013 to quote Wikipedia \u2013 \u201cPrince Merkimer, from the kingdom of Bentwood, who is arranged to marry [Princess] Bean, but was turned into a pig\u201d. Netflix 27/40 Top Boy Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn\u2019t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane \u201cKano\u201d Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. Netflix 28/40 Unbelievable A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine expos\u00e9 of American justice\u2019s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody\u2019s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart\u2019s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Netflix 29/40 Russian Doll Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett. Netflix 30/40 The Umbrella Academy Gerard Way\u2019s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity\u2019s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R&B queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Netflix 31/40 When They See Us Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. Atsushi Nishijima/Netflix 32/40 The Dark Crystal This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom\u2026 a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander. 33/40 The Haunting of Hill House A rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan\u2019s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot \u2013 and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Steve Dietl/Netflix 34/40 The OA Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the \u201cmovements\u201d that permit travel across time and space. That\u2019s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons \u2013 and the mother of all cliff-hangers \u2013 the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? Netflix 35/40 Our Planet David Attenborough provides the narration \u2013 but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Netflix 36/40 The Dragon Prince Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it\u2019s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid\u2019s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery \u2013 there are dragons, elves and magicians \u2013 but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn \u2013 and did we mention the dragons? 37/40 Castlevania A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he\u2019s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. Netflix 38/40 Tuca and Bertie Netflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix\u2019s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of \u201cthe friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.\u201d The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats \u2013 specifically its depiction of the central relationship \u2013 yank the heartstrings. 39/40 Blown Away Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it\u2019s riveting viewing even if you can\u2019t tell a kiln from a kangaroo. 40/40 Dead to Me Linda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship \u2013 but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they\u2019d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series. Saeed Adyani / Netflix\n\nBut it is her reimagining of Christie tales that Phelps is best known for. When I put this to her, she shifts uncomfortably in her sequined skirt. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you go, \u2019How has this happened? Totally accidentally,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nPhelps grew up in the London suburb of Molesey reading Ian Fleming, rather than Christie, and had devoured the entire set of James Bond novels by the age of nine, which, she admits, \u201cperhaps doesn\u2019t give you quite the view of the world that somebody should have, but there you go\u201d. She scoffs over the debate about whether a non-white actor can play 007. \u201cOh my goodness, \u2019He\u2019s got to be white,\u2019\u201d she mimics the more vitriolic end of Twitter. \u201cOh, f*** me sideways, Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nHer language is just as colourful in person as it is on social media, with one post describing grouse hunters as \u201cclammy arseholes\u201d. Her Twitter bio is simply: \u201cScreenwriter. Pervert. BBC Monster.\u201d\n\nPhelps was thrown out of school at 15 for being \u201ca pain in the arse\u201d. \u201cI was just bored like all 15-year-olds,\u201d she explains. \u201cIrritated and fractious. Even to this day I have problems with rooms, my knees start to twitch.\u201d And I believe her, her eyes keep darting towards the door as if she\u2019s trying to locate the quickest escape route.\n\nAfter leaving education, Phelps worked as a horse groom, before starting night school at the local FE college and signing up for English on a whim. \u201cSuddenly everything made sense,\u201d she says. Later, talking about her university degree in English, she gushes: \u201cI loved it, it was like being high for three years.\u201d\n\nFast-forward a few decades and a dozen TV shows, and Phelps\u2019s next project is Christie\u2019s The Pale Horse, due to air this Christmas. That is, unless \u201csomething goes horribly wrong \u2013 but I bloody hope it doesn\u2019t\u201d. Phelps is surely alluding, here, to the scandal that engulfed her series Ordeal by Innocence, which was supposed to be shown over the 2017 festive period but was postponed until Easter 2018 after one of its leads, Ed Westwick, was accused of sexual assault.\n\nWhen the allegations came to light a month before Ordeal by Innocence was due to air, Westwick was dropped from the show and replaced by Christian Cooke. Westwick has consistently denied the allegations made against him and it was confirmed by the LA District Attorney in 2018 that he would not face any charges due to insufficient evidence.\n\nPhelps remembers the chaos well. \u201cI came away from that thinking, when people go, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019ve got a bit of a problem,\u2019 you want to go to them, \u2019That ain\u2019t a f***ing problem, mate. That\u2019s not a f***ing problem,\u2019\u201d she says, shaking her head.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve weathered that, which was really tricky and incredibly traumatic and painful to everyone \u2013 well, it was just horrible.\u201d\n\nWas the BBC right to remove Westwick from the drama?\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair to answer that,\u201d says Phelps, \u201cbecause it wouldn\u2019t be fair on Ed and the other actors and the woman who made the accusation. We didn\u2019t have any other option but to do that at that time. It\u2019s just the way it was. If we\u2019d gone ahead, what would that have looked like?\u201d\n\nI ask whether she had any involvement in the decision to replace Westwick. \u201cNo, that is up there,\u201d she replies, wide-eyed and reaching her hands up to the ceiling. \u201cThat was people in very, very high rooms because of the situation. It was just like, \u2018Well, this is how it\u2019s going to be,\u2019 and then we scurried about and made it happen.\u201d\n\nPhelps says she doesn\u2019t want the whole story to \u201cbelch up again\u201d because of the emotional impact it had on Westwick\u2019s mother. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve met someone\u2019s darling mum and watched her son help her over the roots in the pine forest and get her a chair and make sure she\u2019s got a cup of tea you just think, \u2019Christ sake, everybody goes through hell.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust two months before the BBC announced it was cutting Westwick from Ordeal by Innocence, Kevin Spacey was removed from All the Money in the World and replaced by Christopher Plummer following sexual assault allegations. Spacey\u2019s scenes had to be reshot just six weeks before the film\u2019s release date. Phelps\u2019s mouth drops to the floor at the thought of it. \u201cF***ing hell,\u201d she breathes. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about that. What the f***? It\u2019s not going to be the last time that happens, is it? Bloody hell, what a time it was.\u201d\n\nGiven how much of Phelps\u2019s career has been dedicated to adapting Christie, is it strange when Hollywood gets its claws on the writer\u2019s work? What did she think of Kenneth Branagh\u2019s star-studded and widely panned Murder on the Orient Express, for example? Phelps simply purses her lips mischievously, does a cheeky side-eye and says, after a long and meaningful pause, \u201cIt\u2019s completely nothing to do with me.\u201d\n\nPhelps is no stranger to criticism herself, with some purists taking issue with how she modernises Christie\u2019s stories. \u201cThey\u2019re entitled to their opinion,\u201d says Phelps, who has clearly spent a lot of time trying to unpick the reaction of her critics. \u201cThe personal devotion [for Christie fans] is strong, and it\u2019s probably difficult when somebody comes along and changes things, but everything is subject to change, all of it.\n\n\u201cI did a panel once after I did Great Expectations and there was a woman there who said to me, \u2018You ruined Great Expectations. You RUINED it. You took out all the jokes.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, it\u2019s the strangest book in the world: a man\u2019s going to lose his life and a child gets stolen and given this depraved sexual education and it\u2019s all about betrayal and somebody\u2019s going to swing at the end of a rope unless, you know, and I don\u2019t get the joke and I don\u2019t think Dickens does either. I don\u2019t think he does.\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople get really, really attached and I think it\u2019s all about saying, \u2018Your personal experience, which you imagine to be everybody\u2019s experience, doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s not valid.\u2019 I suppose that\u2019s pretty painful.\u201d\n\nPhelps says there's there's only one way she can interpret Christie's work, and that's in her own way. \u201cWriters want to be read,\" she continues, \"they don\u2019t want to be venerated, they don\u2019t want to be a brand, they don\u2019t want to be a heritage trail, they don\u2019t want to be fudge, they don\u2019t want to be a tea towel.\n\nShe pauses. \u201cThey\u2019ve got something to say and they want to be read.\u201d\n\nDublin Murders begins on Monday 14 October at 9pm on BBC1", "description": "I go for massive, yomping walks, kind of cursing to myself, and then I write, fast and in an angry way while I rage-eat Dairylea triangles,\u201d says Sarah Phelps, sitting in a tea room in a central London hotel. The master adapter of no fewer than five Agatha Christie novels is explaining her unique writing process. She is funny, vivacious, unapologetic.", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/10/sarah-phelps.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
