The rest of the funds collected \u2014 104 million euros in total \u2014 will be \"given out when needed.\"\n\nThe estimation for the conservation of the historical monument is 85 million euros, he added.\n\nRiester spoke little about the investigation into the fire, saying those were questions for the authorities.\n\nThe Paris' prosecutor told Euronews they couldn't comment as the investigation is ongoing.\n\nA massive fire consumed Notre-Dame on the evening of April 15, destroying the roof of the Paris landmark and stunning people in France and the world. Firefighters saved the main bell towers and outer walls from collapse before bringing the blaze under control.", "description": "The French culture minister is more concerned with quality over speed.", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/17/70/04/1000x563_cmsv2_ab385c61-0713-5063-b80b-0f9e9c53d83e-4177004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
