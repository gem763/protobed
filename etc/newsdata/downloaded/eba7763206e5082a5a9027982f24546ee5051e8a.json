The pix showed them kissing in front of church, staring in each other\u2019s eyes and Jancou showing off her six-carat Glenn Bradford diamond ring as they toasted the milestone.\n\n\u201cSHE SAID YES!\u201d the Long Island-based architect captioned the photos. He added the F. Scott Fitzgerald quote, \u201dI love her, and that\u2019s the beginning and the end of everything.\u201d\n\nWhile Cook is in romantic bliss, among the comments are some just skewering him for romancing someone who\u2019s the same age as his daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook.\n\n\u201cYou should be embarrassed, a man your age (60) marrying a 21 year old,\u201d wrote one person. \u201cSo creepy and disturbing,\u201d\n\n\u201cShe now has [two] granddads,\u201d posted another.\n\nOne person asked if Jancou calls him \u201c\u2018Daddy\u2019 or \u2018black card.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that his daughter, who just wrapped a run on Dancing With the Stars, offered her congratulations or a \u201dlike\u201d on the post. But she\u2019s presumably had more than a month to digest the news.\n\nAccording to a People magazine source, Brinkley Cook \u201chas a very close relationship with her dad\u201d despite his \u201cbitter breakup\u201d with her supermodel mother. \u201cShe always raves about him. But she has not said a word to anybody about his personal life or the new girlfriend.\u201d (Brinkley\u2019s son, Jack Brinkley Cook, was adopted by Cook, but was from her marriage to Richard Taubman.)\n\nCook and Brinkley\u2019s divorce, after a decade of marriage, was particularly nasty \u2014 even by Hollywood standards. He had an affair with an 18-year-old, Diana Bianchi, who he met at a Hamptons, NY, toy store and hired to work for him. They had reported trysts in his office and he lavished gifts on her, including $15,000 for a car. After separating in 2006, Cook and Brinkley\u2019s divorce was finalized in 2008 \u2014 after a big court showdown at which Bianchi testified.\n\nCook's second marriage, to Suzanne Shaw, also ended in divorce. As it was happening in 2015, Page Six reportedly got its hands on an email sent from Shaw to Cook that accused him of having a \u201csecret pathological predilection\u201d for young women.\n\nThat isn\u2019t stopping Cook from giving marriage another shot. He announced his engagement to Jancou, the daughter of two NYC art dealers, on Monday, saying in a statement, \u201cWe consider ourselves incredibly lucky to have found, in each other, our soulmate. We are looking forward to many years of wedded bliss!\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
