PA\n\nAnd 30 years after graduation any outstanding amount is cancelled.\n\nYet just 44 per cent of graduates surveyed on behalf of the Association of Investment Companies felt their degree was good value for money. The high cost contributed to that \u2013 only 26 per cent of students and just 13 per cent of graduates thought they would repay their debt within 30 years.\n\nIf you measure the value of a degree based on how much the graduate earns then many courses are still worth it. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows that 88 per cent of graduates are employed compared to 72 per cent of non-graduates.\n\nAnd graduates earn a median average wage of \u00a334,000, compared with \u00a324,000 for non-graduates.\n\nBut is that really the point?\n\nMore than money\n\nA lot of employers look for more than a degree from graduate applicants. They want to see what else that person did with their time \u2013 and many universities offer a range of opportunities.\n\nCatriona Scott is director of people at Explore Learning, hiring more than 250 graduates every year. She says university can help develop softer skills that are useful at every stage of your career: \u201cUniversity offers a real opportunity to develop skills like resilience, communication and empathy. When we interview graduates, we want to hear about the experiences they\u2019ve had at university and how their transferable skills will support us with our business goals.\n\n\u201cGraduates always have a story to tell; whether that\u2019s from a particularly challenging presentation, their dissertation project, or a charity programme they were involved in. Whilst there are more graduates out there than ever before, making the job market a lot more competitive, it\u2019s important for graduates to appreciate these skills and showcase them to potential employers. A university degree offers a lot more than just the qualification.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps too easy to judge the success of a degree based on the first and second jobs that graduates get but Andrew Wathey, vice-chancellor of Northumbria University, says a degree adds lifelong value.\n\n\u201cA university education is about giving people better choice for their future careers \u2013 that\u2019s not just their first graduate job, it\u2019s equipping them for their second, third and fourth career change.\n\n\u201cThe nation needs a workforce that is adaptable and able to respond effectively to an ever-changing environment \u2013 and universities play a crucial part in delivering that. Let\u2019s not forget there are jobs today that didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nConversely, time spent on a degree means not spending that time in work and for some graduates that is a regret.\n\n\u201cI think if students had to think more about what they want to do and try other routes that are less expensive then they might have a better financial outcome,\u201d says Julianne Ponan, chief executive of Creative Nature.\n\nShe admits having some regrets about the time she spent at university and that is only partly down to the cost. \u201cEven though I went to university I feel that working or apprenticeships could be a much more viable route that gives you more life lessons,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cEven a gap year or working abroad teaches a lot more life lessons including how to budget, how to fend for yourself. My decision to go to university was based on the career that I wanted to follow later, however business took me on a different path and to be honest I wish I had started earlier in business.\u201d\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t qualified\u2019\n\nTom Bourlet now works as a marketing manager for Evanta and says it was only after he graduated that he realised his course had not been sufficiently up to date.\n\nHe says: \u201cI realised I wasn\u2019t qualified for the jobs I was applying for, even though I had studied marketing for years. I had learned about traditional marketing but the university struggled to train us on the new digital landscape, such as SEO, PPC and affiliates.\u201d\n\nTom is not alone. Research from Campus Society, a social media network for students, recently found that 25 per cent of students felt their degree left them lacking in the technical skills they needed for their chosen career.\n\nHe was forced to study in the evenings to catch up on the areas he had not been taught. Despite that, he says it was worth it. \u201cThe experience of studying in Brighton, of meeting friends who I still see as the greatest in the world 10 years on, the laughs and the memories are easily the best of my life. I paid for the experience, not for the degree.\n\n\u201cI joined multiple societies, including drama and extreme sports, both of which I loved. We would finish studying and then head off kayaking in the sea.\u201d\n\nTom\u2019s experience may sound priceless but \u00a350,000 is undeniably a lot to spend. Sophie Phillipson, founder of student and graduate support site HelloGrads, says the answer is to find the most valuable degree.\n\n\u201cWhile some do question the value of their course, most would agree the university experience is priceless,\u201d she says. \u201cA bit like the dress rehearsal for \u2018real life\u2019, living away at university is usually the first time many have left the family fold and must learn to be independent, negotiating rent, bills and budgeting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the chance to make great friends and career connections for life, while building out your CV with all manner of extracurricular activities from sports to drama to student media to volunteering.\n\n\u201cBut, with such high fees, questioning the value of your course and the quality of teaching before committing yourself is a really sensible idea.\u201d\n\nSo go out, study and don\u2019t be put off by student loans. Just make sure that the teaching, location and enjoyment will feel worth the expense, whether you measure that by earning potential or life lessons learnt.", "description": "A whole new crop of soon-to-be undergraduates will spend this weekend either celebrating their exam success or working their way through the clearance system to find a place.
