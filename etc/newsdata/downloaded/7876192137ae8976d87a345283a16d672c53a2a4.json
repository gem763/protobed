This was the fastest pace for housing starts since 2007. Economists polled by MarketWatch had anticipated a 1.26 million rate for starts.\n\nPermits to build additional homes, meanwhile, rose 8% to a seasonally-adjusted annual pace of 1.42 million from July\u2019s 1.32 million. For permits, economists polled by MarketWatch expected a rate of 1.30 million.\n\nWhat happened? A significant uptick in the construction of multifamily properties boosted overall housing starts. The rate of construction of buildings with five or more units jumped 30% to an annual rate of 424,000, while single-family starts rose by a more modest 4% to 919,000. Nevertheless, August was the strongest month for single-family starts since January.\n\nNew-home construction accelerated across all parts of the country, except in the West, where activity kept even with the pace set in July. Overall, housing starts were roughly 7% higher than the rate set a year ago.\n\nPermitting activity increased in August across both the single-family and multifamily segments, even as economists polled by MarketWatch expected it to slow slightly. As with housing starts, an uptick in new housing unit authorizations occurred everywhere except in the West, where they fell by nearly 8%.\n\nBig picture: August\u2019s new-home construction figures were released just as the Federal Open Market Committee appears poised to cut short-term interest rates. The Fed\u2019s decision will likely be influenced by the same headwinds that home builders have faced. \u201cHome builders have been wary of the potential impact from the trade war on potential buyers\u2019 confidence,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Economics, wrote in a research note ahead of Wednesday\u2019s data release.\n\nBut as the trade war and economic uncertainty were major hurdles, the housing market had one significant tailwind moving in its favor: Falling mortgage rates. The precipitous drop in mortgage rates throughout the summer has eased the affordability constraints that plagued many prospective home buyers in previous months.\n\nWith those people coming off the sidelines, demand for housing is likely to rebound in the months ahead. Builders will look to capitalize on that strong appetite in the months ahead by increasing permitting activity, Shepherdson predicted.\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cBuilders are pivoting their supply to help address entry-level demand, but scarce developable land in desirable locations met with high prices is making their job hard,\u201d said Ali Wolf, director of economic research at Meyers Research Group. \u201cEven with tight supply though, the new home market is on track for the best sales year since 2007.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% were little-changed by the housing starts data in Friday morning trades.\n\nShares of home-building companies such as LGI Homes LGIH, -0.01%, D.R. Horton DHI, +1.35% and Meritage Homes MTH, +1.67% all edged up on the data, as did two funds that track housing stocks, the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB, +0.64% and the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF XHB, +0.05% .", "description": "Permits to build new homes rose 8% to a seasonally-adjusted annual pace of 1.42 million, the fastest pace since 2007.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GA648_builde_ZG_20171221101528.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
