Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Saturday responded to the remarks President Trump made at Benedict College on Friday, telling the president that the criminal justice system is designed to \u201cgive people like you a pass\u201d and adding, \u201cFor once in your life, you\u2019re being held accountable.\u201d\n\nTrump on Friday delivered a speech at the Second Step Presidential Justice forum at Benedict College and suggested that the ongoing impeachment probe, which Democrats have largely shrouded with secrecy, has given him a deeper sense of the justice system.\n\n\u201cYou know I have my own experience, you know that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou see what\u2019s going on with the witch hunt. It\u2019s a terrible thing that\u2019s going on in our country \u2014 no crimes \u2014 it\u2019s an investigation in search of a crime.\u201d\n\nOmar, a far-left lawmaker who supports the impeachment inquiry, proclaimed that Trump is finally \u201cbeing held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe criminal justice system is designed to unjustly incarcerate black and brown people \u2014 and give people like you a pass. For once in your life, you\u2019re being held accountable,\u201d she wrote:\n\nThe criminal justice system is designed to unjustly incarcerate black and brown people \u2014 and give people like you a pass.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) warned that impeachment due process would essentially \u201chelp potential criminals line up their testimony.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey @AOC I thought you supported Open and Transparent government,\u201d Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV) wrote in response to Ocasio-Cortez dismissing the GOP lawmakers\u2019 attempts to demand transparency by confronting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) in his secret impeachment chamber. She called the attempt a \u201clittle flash mob.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruth is for @AOC the ends justify the means and she gladly reverts to Soviet style secret hearings in the Capitol basement,\u201d he added.\n\nThe socialist lawmaker defended Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment lair and essentially argued that impeachment due process would destroy the Democrats\u2019 ability to control the narrative of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cRep. Mooney, you & I both know that when a massive crime is committed, the 1st step is to separate witnesses & get their stories to see what adds up,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cYou know that making these depositions public will help potential criminals line up their testimony. Why do you want to do that?\u201d she added:\n\nRep. Mooney, you & I both know that when a massive crime is committed, the 1st step is to separate witnesses & get their stories to see what adds up.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) canceled her scheduled appearance at the historically black college after it featured and honored the president for his advances in criminal justice reform.\n\nTrump slammed the presidential hopeful, calling her a \u201cbadly failing presidential candidate\u201d and adding that his administration is doing more than Harris \u201cwill EVER be able to do for African Americans!\u201d:", "description": "Rep.
