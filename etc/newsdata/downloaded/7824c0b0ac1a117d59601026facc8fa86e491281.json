They catered to rural America, were family-friendly, even Christian-friendly, and prided themselves on offering products made in America.\n\nThey catered to hunters, farmers, families and elders, all who gladly flocked to these stores. There was no fear of having to explain to your child why pornography was at the checkout. Great prices, as well as respectful and abundant workers, were common. It was a company that many were comfortable shopping at and investing in, with no concern regarding immoral, anti-God, anti-family or even anti-American attitudes that many retail outlets had come to adopt.\n\nOh, how things have changed.\n\nToday, the very same company many Christian families once considered \u201csafe\u201d has turned its back on patriotic shoppers and families with Christian ethics who preferred made-in-America products. Does it sadden you to see this once giant among peers\u2014whose stature can be attributed to average, working-class, patriotic Americans\u2014join the ranks of its weaker peers with immoral and anti-family investments and activities? Does it concern you that we no longer can feel safe allowing our children to shop in these stores due to fear of exposure to sexually explicit publications or that hunters, as well as respectful and abundant workers, are now asked to go elsewhere for products? Or that patriots will have to acquire a hunter\u2019s mentality just to find a made-in-America product within the caverns of these giant stores?\n\nNo one wants to see a retail giant fall from grace. But even investors are reconsidering holding ownership and stock in this company. This is not due so much to its market performance, but because of its new focus and policy reversals regarding Christian values and lack of quality American-made products.\n\nAccording to eVALUEator Services, the No. 1 investment research firm for Biblically Responsible Investing (BRI) data, this giant retailer is now selling pornographic material in its retail stores as well as providing charitable aid or donations to non-profit organizations that include foundations that pay for abortions, provide emergency contraception pills, birth control pills and/or pursue \u201creproductive freedom.\u201d\n\nRegarding hunters and Americans who embrace their constitutional right to bear arms, you may have seen articles proclaiming that this retail giant will now limit ammunition sales and ask customers not to openly carry.\n\nMost investors have heard or seen some of these changes taking place. Yet, most do not know for certain or have a way to know for sure what companies like these are doing. All that has changed since the inception of the National Association of Christian Financial Consultants, which was founded to educate and equip investment professionals with the knowledge and tools to help their clients invest biblically by avoiding companies that use or abuse people, or promote or profit from immoral, harmful products or services.\n\nNow, NACFC offers a free investment tool, powered by eVALUEator and available to everyone to screen their investments for themselves. If you want to know what your retail giant is profiting from or promoting, visit nacfc.org, scroll down to the \u201cFree Screening Tool\u201d button, and type in the company name or symbol you want to evaluate.\n\nIt\u2019s that easy to find out exactly what corporate America is doing with Christian investors\u2019 money.\n\n(For additional help managing a portfolio with integrity, visit nacfc.org/advisor-directory to find a professional investment adviser trained and equipped by the NACFC.)\n\n(Mark Minnella is president and co-founder of the National Association of Christian Financial Consultants.
