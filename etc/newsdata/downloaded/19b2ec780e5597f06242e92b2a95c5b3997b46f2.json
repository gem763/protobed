Crouch retains Suzanne Yeates, the company secretary who presided over those failures and simultaneously serves in the same role at three other listed companies, two (Novonix and IntelliHR Holdings) chaired by Bellas and the third (State Gas) where he\u2019s deputy chair.\n\nAnd the Explanatory Memorandum appended to the Notice of AGM proves Crouch\u2019s words entirely empty. On Resolution 4 to elect Sophie Mitchell a director of the company, we are told that \u201cMs Mitchell is considered by the Board to be an Independent Director.\u201d\n\nBut Mitchell is also a director of Morgans Holdings (Australia) Limited, where she worked for 25 years until March 2018.", "description": "Given the chairman's solemn promise of good governance, we half expected him to deliver it.
