USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 For Kyrie Irving, his Brooklyn Nets debut carried profound professional and personal significance.\n\nOn the court, Irving dug into his back of tricks \u2013 reverses, 3-pointers, creative use of the backboard, elite dribbling \u2013 and torched the Minnesota Timberwolves for 50 points in a game the Timberwolves won 127-126 in overtime.\n\nAs Irving left Barclays Center, he told USA TODAY Sports, \u201cThis is bigger than basketball.\u201d\n\nOne year ago to the day, Irving\u2019s grandfather, George Larson, died, and it had a devastating effect on Irving, who told reporters earlier this month the experience made basketball seem irrelevant, and in turn, it forced him to re-evaluate his priorities on and off the court.\n\nIrving, who grew up nearby in West Orange, New Jersey, discovered he wanted to be closer to home, near his friends and family. He left Boston for Brooklyn in free agency to find some inner peace.\n\n\u201cI just had to make choice to be happy out there,\u201d Irving said. \u201cMy grandfather would only want it that way for me. He was my biggest fan. He was definitely in there tonight. I felt him, and I know he\u2019s going to be with me.\u201d\n\nOpinion: Lakers-Clippers can become rivalry even if Lakers will always own LA\n\nMore: Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith debate NBA's China controversy\n\nThe emotions welled before the opening tip. \u201cI was just trying to play it as cool as I could,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was going to be a tough day regardless. Yesterday was tougher than today just talking to my grandmother, talking to my dad, talking to my sister. Today, I made a conscious choice when I woke up to be grateful for the day and every day going forward.\u201d\n\nAnd just before the game, Irving addressed the home crowd, saying, \u201cOh man, I am eternally grateful to be here, to be back home in front of you guys. On behalf of all of us \u2026 Oh man, sorry, it is just hitting me right now. I appreciate you guys. I look forward to you guys supporting us all season. Let\u2019s go, Nets.\u201d\n\nHe was overcome with emotion. The reality of actually playing for the Nets struck deep.\n\nKyrie addresses the fans in Brooklyn on opening night \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/n2yNK9OnqN \u2014 NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to get too emotional or anything like that,\u201d Irving said. \u201cI\u2019m just a Jersey kid playing for his home team. There\u2019s nothing like it. It\u2019s been brewing since the fourth grade. I didn\u2019t know it was going to happen at this point or this age. But it\u2019s here and I just want to take advantage of it and just be happy and have a sense of gratitude every time I step on the floor.\u201d\n\nIrving delivered a mesmerizing offensive performance. He had 12 points in the first quarter, 13 in the second, five in the third, 13 in the fourth and by the time overtime concluded, Irving had dropped 50 on the Timberwolves. He established a franchise record for most points in a Nets debut.\n\nKyrie Irving counted each defender he beat for the layup \ud83d\ude06 pic.twitter.com/3pFNI6jYC4 \u2014 SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) October 24, 2019\n\nIt was a joyous display of scoring, and if this is what the Kyrie Irving Era in Brooklyn is going to look like, Barclays Center will be a fun place to be this season.\n\nDuring a thrilling burst of points late in the fourth quarter, Irving had nine points in 62 seconds. He finished 17-for-33 from the field, including 7-for-14 on 3-pointers. It was Irving\u2019s third career game with at least 50 points.\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving (11) attempts a pass against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Nets fans chanted, \u201cKyrie\u2019s home, Kyrie\u2019s home\u201d as he shot free throws in the fourth quarter. As introspective as Irving is, it\u2019s a night he won\u2019t forget.", "description": "One year to the day of his grandfather's death, Kyrie Irving - a New Jersey native - set a team record by scoring 50 points in his Nets debut.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published P.M.
