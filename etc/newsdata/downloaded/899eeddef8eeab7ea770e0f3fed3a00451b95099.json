Add Venezuela as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Venezuela news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nEU headquarters said Friday that four of the seven , who face asset freezes and travel bans, are linked to the death of Capt. Rafael Acosta Ar\u00e9valo, a Venezuelan navy officer allegedly tortured in state custody. The move means 25 people are now subject to EU sanctions over the crisis in Venezuela.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela continue to face a dramatic situation. The regional impact of the crisis is unprecedented, with severe risks for regional stability,\" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement. She said the EU stands ready to broaden the sanctions to encourage a political transition and presidential elections, but that the measures can be dialed down if progress is made.\n\nIn Geneva, the Human Rights Council voted 19-7 with 21 abstentions for the resolution to create a one-year mission to investigate \"extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment\" in Venezuela over the past five years.\n\nIn July, U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet issued a report saying Venezuela's government registered nearly 5,300 killings during security operations last year linked to \"resistance to authority.\"\n\nThe measure brought by the \"Lima Group\" of countries that oppose President Nicolas Maduro stopped short of creating a Commission of Inquiry, the greatest level of scrutiny the council can authorize.\n\nMaduro's opponents had been pushing for more sweeping EU sanctions to include officials, including the president, for undermining the country's democratic institutions.\n\nTwo years ago, the Trump administration added Maduro to its sanctions list of now more than 100 Venezuelan officials and insiders whose U.S. assets are frozen and who are barred from doing business with Americans.\n\nBut the EU has been slower than the U.S. and Canada to confront Maduro, fearing it could wreck the possibility of a negotiated solution to the political stalemate that has exacerbated misery in a country where more than 4 million people \u2014 almost 15% of the population \u2014 has migrated in search of work and food abroad.\n\nMore recently, the outlook for a deal with opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom the U.S. and many EU countries recognize as Venezuela's rightful leader, has soured after Maduro ended talks sponsored by Norway, instead opening a dialogue with a small group of minority parties that represent less than 10% of the opposition-controlled congress.\n\nThe EU's cautious approach has drawn criticism from members of Venezuela's opposition, which believe it gives oxygen to Maduro's government.\n\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza has repeatedly denounced sanctions by the U.S. and EU as an illegal violation of the country's sovereignty. But under the logic of such actions, he said, such tools should be used against Guaid\u00f3 because he had promoted violence.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
