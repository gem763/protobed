Fellow tech giant Apple recently came under fire for blacklisting an app from its own app store that allowed people to track protests and police activity in Hong Kong.\n\nThe game appears to be a very basic \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d style text game where the story of a Hong Kong protestor is told as users make choices and decisions throughout the game. A Google spokesperson told the WSJ that a Play Store policy bans apps or games that are seen to be \u201ccapitalizing on sensitive events such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game.\u201d\n\nThe game was free but did offer in-app purchases ranging in price between $0.99 and $14.99 according to the games cached Google Play Store page. The app was downloaded over 1,000 times before being removed according to the cached page.\n\nApple has also come under fire for removing a pro-Hong Kong app. The firm once again blacklisted the HKmap.live app that tracked police presence and protest activity in Hong Kong from its app store. The company has flip-flopped repeatedly on whether the app should be allowed in the store, initially telling developers: \u201cYour app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement,\u201d and banning the app.\n\nFollowing outcry over the initial banning, the app was reinstated to Apple\u2019s store. Now, following criticism from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper, The People\u2019s Daily, which stated that the app \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior,\u201d leading it to question if Apple was \u201cguiding Hong Kong thugs,\u201d The Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have once against bowed to the wishes of communist China.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
