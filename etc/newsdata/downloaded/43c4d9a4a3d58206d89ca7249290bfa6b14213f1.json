The police action was first reported by Fox-5. Two men who were inside the home at the time were arrested.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe raid came four years after the last owner, Douglas Jefferies, 52, settled a lawsuit filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine over the Airbnb-marketed \u201cCelebrity House Hunter Mansion\u201d and agreed to stop all business activity, including concerts that included rapper Ja Rule, weddings and parties.\n\nOwner of Q Street house agrees to stop parties\n\nAt the time, Racine\u2019s spokesman called the house \u201ca real headache\u201d and \u201ca threat to public safety.\u201d The house had not been licensed for large-scale events, and Racine\u2019s office said police had been called to the address more than 100 times.\n\nThe house was listed on Airbnb even after the settlement with Racine, though with a warning it was \u201cnot for events.\u201d The price dropped from $1,200 to $900 a night. Property records show the home with five bedrooms and five bathrooms went into foreclosure in July 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDavid R. Bender, chairman of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for that area, said there had not been large parties at the house since the settlement. But he remained concerned about the allegations of drug dealing.\n\nOf the police activity, Bender said: \u201cI think the whole neighborhood is delighted with the news. It would be good to close it down.\u201d\n\nD.C. attorney general sues homeowner to stop parties\n\nCourt documents say police had been investigating alleged pop-up marijuana parties at the house since the summer of 2018. Police said the events were advertised on sites such as Instagram under the name HonestHerbsDC and led customers through a series of texts and emails to learn the precise address. In once instance, police said customers were directed to another house, then led to a back entrance at 2220 Q Street that could be reached only by walking through a church parking lot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit, an undercover police officer attended an event Sept. 17 and paid $60 for suspected marijuana. The officer wrote he met a man from Australia who billed himself as a professional marijuana consultant and was promoting his own strain, called \u201cOutback Smokehouse.\u201d\n\nPolice raided the house Sept. 25. John Scripps Sweeney, 51, and Nabil Yazbeck, 20, were each charged with felony possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.\n\nSweeney and Yazbeck were freed pending hearings in D.C. Superior Court on Oct. 15. Their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSweeney told police he lived at the home, and Yazbeck said he lives in Virginia but visits the Q Street address every day.\n\nAD\n\nJefferies was not at the house when police showed up last week, court records show, and it is not clear whether he has any connection to the men. He declined to comment.\n\nAlexandria man pleads guilty to manslaughter\n\nIn quadruple murder, one man is convicted, but the motive remains a mystery\n\nHe had \u2018goals and a vision.\u2019 Jamel Kirkland is D.C.\u2019s eighth victim age 11 to 17 to be fatally shot this year.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Authorities raided the house on Q Street NW on Sept. 25", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
