It was here that the 25-year-old experienced his first encounter with craft beer.\n\n\"It's a pity that I got drunk that night. Otherwise, I could have tried many more,\" said the novice craft beer drinker, beaming. \"All those beers are creative and taste so different from what I am used to.\"\n\nThe visit has since changed his approach to beer, a drink that he often chooses to pair with barbecue or spicy crayfish in the summer, Yuan told China Daily Website.\n\nYuan is just one of many Chinese consumers, young and old, that are increasingly drawn to this variable beverage that is distinctly different from factory beer.", "description": "Unlike the mass-produced lager that has long dominated Chinese beer market, craft beer made by microbreweries places a much greater emphasis on quality, flavor and brewing techniques.
