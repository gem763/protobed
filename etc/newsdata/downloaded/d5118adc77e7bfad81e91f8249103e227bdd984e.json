During these months, the company\u2019s working capital needs are higher, potentially adding to the strain on its finances, according to Jean-Pierre Husband, a director at Fitch Ratings Ltd.\n\nThomas Cook said it expects talks with banks and bondholders will continue throughout the weekend.\n\nBritain\u2019s oldest packaged-holiday company could go out of business within days if the rescue deal, initially agreed in July, doesn\u2019t go through, a person familiar with the matter said. Under the initial deal, Fosun would become the largest shareholder in Thomas Cook\u2019s tour business and get a minority stake in the company\u2019s airline business. A large part of Thomas Cook\u2019s debt of \u00a31.24 billion at the end of March would be swapped into equity. The rescue deal was supposed to be voted on by creditors on Sept. 27. A recapitalization, consisting of the stand-by facility and \u00a3900 million of fresh capital injected by banks, bondholders and Fosun, could significantly dilute existing shareholders\u2019 interests, Thomas Cook said.\n\nFosun said Friday its proposed contribution of \u00a3450 million has not changed. \u201cWe are still working tirelessly with a large number of other stakeholders and interested parties to find agreement on the company\u2019s proposed [recapitalization] plan,\u201d Fosun said in a statement.\n\nThomas Cook is currently in the process of prolonging its license as an operator of packaged holidays, a regular procedure that applies to all companies offering these kinds of travel services, according to a spokesman for the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority, a regulator.\n\nShould Thomas Cook fail to extend its license by Sept. 30, the U.K. government could be forced to fly home thousands of customers holidaying abroad. There are about 600,000 customers currently on holiday outside of the U.K., Thomas Cook said.\n\nThe company has struggled with a decline in tour and flight bookings, higher fuel prices and uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union. \u201cIt is clear that the trends experienced in the first half of the year have continued into the second half, reflecting an uncertain consumer environment, particularly in the U.K., leading to intense competition,\u201d Thomas Cook said in a statement in July.\n\nThomas Cook on Friday didn\u2019t comment on reports saying that it is exploring a sale of its Nordics business to raise additional cash.\n\nSuch a transaction won\u2019t solve the longer-term issues surrounding the travel company and might force the parties involved to renegotiate the rescue deal, said Kathryn Leonard, an associate director at Numis Securities Ltd. \u201cThey would have to revisit the terms of the current proposal,\u201d Ms. Leonard said.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Troubled British travel company Thomas Cook Group is under pressure from lenders to find an additional \u00a3200 million ($249.5 million) to avoid the collapse of a rescue deal that would see Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. inject significant funds.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109203/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
