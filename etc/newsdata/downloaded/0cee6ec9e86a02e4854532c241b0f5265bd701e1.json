For Russia calls, I was the lead drafter of these materials, known as \u201ccall packages.\u201d But all of these talking points and briefing memos were approved \u2014 or as, we used to say, \u201ccleared\u201d \u2014 by staff at the NSC.\n\nJudging from the content of the Trump-Zelensky call, Trump was not reading talking points. No one on our team would have ever prepared a call package prompting Obama to ask for a personal favor that would help him win reelection. I also doubt that Trump\u2019s NSC staff would have written or cleared such a talking point for their boss.\n\nTalking points for an Obama call with a Ukrainian leader after 2014 also would have denounced Russian annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine and stressed U.S. support for Ukrainian sovereignty and democracy. My guess is that Trump\u2019s NSC professional staff would have written similar talking points. Trump delivered none of these messages.\n\nSecond, before every call Obama had with foreign leaders, we conducted a \u201cpre-brief\u201d in the Oval Office. I considered these briefings to be one of the most important parts of my White House job. In these sessions, we discussed in detail the goals of the call \u2014 the U.S. national interests we were seeking to advance. Obama wanted concrete outcomes to be pursued in these conversations.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Mcfaul", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Heres-What-Presidential-Phone-Call-With-Foreign-Leader-Looks-Like-Normal-White-House"], "top_image": ""}
