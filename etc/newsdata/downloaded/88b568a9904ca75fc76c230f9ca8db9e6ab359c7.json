The cost of one Ekomille trap is between $300 and $400.\n\nAdams also displayed one of the trial tanks \u2014 containing dozens of rats floating in a soup of gray liquid \u2014 at the Thursday press conference, which you can see below. (Warning: Graphic images.)\n\nHere's how Gothamist's Jake Offenhartz, who took the video, described the vision: \"Their clumps of fur were tinged green by the alcohol solution, into which they'd been lured and subsequently drowned at some point over the last month.\"\n\n\"We were told they would not smell, and while it was not overpowering, there was definitely a smell,\" he said. \"Eventually, the sodden carcasses were fished out with a ladle and dropped into a trash bag.\"\n\n\"It was a ghastly spectacle and the odor was stomach-churning,\" The Times reported.\n\nThe Ekomille traps don't work on jumbo rats, though. One of Brooklyn's trial boxes broke because one rat \"was so big it broke the spring mechanism in the box so that it was no longer functioning,\" The Times cited Adams's spokesman Jonah Allon as saying.\n\nA rat climbs into box of food at the Herald Square subway platform in New York City in July 2017.
