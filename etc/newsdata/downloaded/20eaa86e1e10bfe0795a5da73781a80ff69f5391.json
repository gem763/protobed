However, the Tarmac versions the researcher identified were relatively old, and the malware's original command and control servers had been shut down -- or most likely moved to a new location. This hindered analysis, as Karim wasn't able to gain a full insight into how Tarmac operated.\n\nAll that's known at the moment is that after Shlayer downloads and installs Tarmac on infected hosts, Tarmac gathers details about a victim's hardware setup and sends this info to its command and control server.\n\nAt this point, Tarmac would wait for new commands. But since these servers aren't available, Karim wasn't able to determine the full scope behind Tarmac.\n\nIn theory, most second-stage malware strains are usually very powerful malware strains, possessing many intrusive features. Tarmac, should, at least in theory, be a very dangerous threat.\n\nHowever, for the time being, the mystery remains.\n\nTarmac distributed to US, Italian, and Japanese users\n\nBut while Tarmac's full set of features have yet to be uncovered, we do know some details about who may have gotten infected.\n\nIn an interview today, Karim told ZDNet that the malvertising campaign that distributed the Shlayer and Tarmac combo was geo-targeted at users located in the US, Italy, and Japan.\n\nWhile the US and Japan are regular targets for malvertising and malware campaigns, Italy is somewhat of an odd choice.\n\n\"We think actors proceed by trial and error, and they might have found a sweet spot in Italy, between the profit they can reap and the level of attention from the security community,\" Karim told ZDNet.\n\nSince Tarmac payloads come signed by legitimate Apple developer certificates, features like Gatekeeper and XProtect won't stop its installation or show any errors.\n\nUsers and companies looking to see if they've had Mac systems infected by this malware can find indicators of compromise (IoCs) in Karim's Tarmac report.", "description": "Tarmac malware deployed via malvertising campaigns across the US, Italy, and Japan.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/11/6508e26b-6694-433e-8ea7-81c8d3f804bb/thumbnail/770x578/26b7ae8ca1045e40008ee0c31df13b2a/macos-dock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
