One of the dreams of having smart lights is being able to sync those lights with whatever movie or TV show you\u2019re watching to create a symphony of light and sound. However, for people with Philips Hue smart lights, the main avenue for doing this up until now has been the Hue Sync app, which only worked on PCs or Macs, which meant you often had to do awkward things like connect a laptop to your TV, or have a really long cord running to a nearby desktop to make things work.\n\nBut with the new Play HDMI Sync Box, Philips Hue is finally giving people a way to easily harmonise their smart lights with the content on their TV screens. The device itself is super simple, it\u2019s just a small four-port HDMI pass-through hub that connects to all your media boxes like an Apple TV, cable box, Nvidia Shield, game console, etc.\n\nGif: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo\n\nFrom there, the Play Sync Box analyses the visual data from whatever content your watching, so that it can simultaneously send that video out to your TV while controlling connected smart lights to match your content.\n\nThe Play Sync Box can automatically switch between any of the four HDMI inputs depending on which device is currently in use. It supports HDMI CEC so you can control those connected devices with a single remote or voice commands, and it supports HDMI 2.0 so you shouldn\u2019t have any issue with 4K HDR content at 60fps or lower.\n\nThese Philips Hue Lights Nearly Blinded Me, But I Still Love Them Sometimes, a gadget comes along that seems to have no discernible purpose or function. But there's a small part of your monkey brain that insists you need it. Whether it be something shiny, strange or just plain 'cool', there are just some things you convince yourself you absolutely need. The Philips Hue Play light bars are one of those things. Nobody needs them, and yet...

This is a good thing, because even though I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, when I saw a demo of the Play Sync Box in action, I actually found the setup a tiny bit overwhelming when all the lights were set on full blast. It\u2019s that intense.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo To setup the Play Sync Box, just plug in your various media boxes in the back, and then connect the HDMI out to your TV. Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo The Play Sync Box has four HDMI inputs and one HDMI out port. Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo The Play Sync Box\u2019s power brick has two extra outputs for powering two additional Hue lights.\n\nAlso, a small bonus that makes setting up smart lights around your TV just a little easier, the Play Sync Box\u2019s power adaptor includes a brick with two extra Hue-compatible power outputs, so you can cut down on the number of outlets your lighting system is hogging.\n\nThe downside to all this is that at $US230 ($335), the Play Sync Box ain\u2019t cheap. That\u2019s a decent chunk of change just so you can make your smart lights flash and change colour in tandem with what\u2019s on your TV. But if you\u2019ve been waiting all this time for Hue to bring colour syncing to the living room, the Play Sync Box is it.\n\nThe Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box goes on sale starting October 16 in the U.S. with an Australian release date and local pricing yet to be announced.", "description": "With the Play HDMI Sync Box Philips Hue users can finally sync their lights to their TVs.
