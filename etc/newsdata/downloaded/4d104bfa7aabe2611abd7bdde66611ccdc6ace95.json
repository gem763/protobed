Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nHow could no deal happen?\n\nAfter Mrs May's deal was defeated, the Brexit deadline was extended to 31 October.\n\nMr Johnson has submitted a new Brexit plan, which the EU is currently considering.\n\nHowever, following a call between Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Number 10 source said a deal was \"essentially impossible\".\n\nTo avoid a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, the UK government must pass a Brexit divorce plan into law, obtain another extension from the EU, or cancel Brexit.\n\nMany politicians are against no deal and Parliament has passed a law that could keep the UK in the EU until the new year, known as the Benn Act.\n\nOpponents of no deal say it will damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nBut some politicians support no deal and say any disruption could be quickly overcome.\n\nWhat would it mean for trade?\n\nUnder a no-deal Brexit, there would be no time to bring in a UK-EU trade deal.\n\nTrade would initially have to be on terms set by the World Trade Organization (WTO), an agency with 162 member countries.\n\nIf this happens, tariffs - taxes on imports - will apply to most goods that UK businesses send to the EU. Many companies worry that could make their goods less competitive.\n\nTrading on WTO terms would also mean border checks for goods, which could cause traffic bottlenecks at ports, such as Dover.\n\nNo deal would also mean the UK service industry would lose its guaranteed access to the EU single market.\n\nThat would affect everyone from bankers and lawyers to musicians and chefs.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protests have been held against the possible return of a hard border in Ireland after a no-deal Brexit\n\nWhat about the Irish border?\n\nNo-one really knows what will happen at the Irish border if there's a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.\n\nIn theory, border checks will be needed as soon as the UK leaves the single market and customs union.\n\nHowever, neither the UK or Irish governments have said they are willing to install border posts.\n\nWhat about the 'divorce bill'?\n\nNo-deal supporters say the UK could avoid paying the divorce settlement agreed by Theresa May's government.\n\nThat was widely believed to be about \u00a339bn, although delays to the exit date mean some of it has already been paid and the latest estimates put it at about \u00a333bn.\n\nBut opinion is split on what happens if the UK refuses to pay and there's a possibility the UK could end up in an international tribunal.\n\nEven if there were no legal consequences, refusing to pay could mean political fallout - lessening the UK's chances of securing an EU trade deal in the future.\n\nWhat does it mean for individuals?\n\nIndividuals could be affected in all sorts of ways.\n\nFor example, if the pound falls sharply in response to no deal and there are significant delays at ports, like Dover, it could affect the price and availability of some foods.\n\nThere are also concerns over potential shortages of medicines.\n\nEU citizens in the UK can apply for settled status, allowing them to remain even if there is a no-deal.\n\nUK expats in the EU are advised to register as residents of the country they live in, although no deal could make moving across borders more difficult.\n\nTravelling with pets will become more complicated and expensive.\n\nAnd European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC) would be invalid after a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAre preparations under way?\n\nMost economists and business groups believe no deal would lead to economic harm.\n\nFor example, the Office for Budget Responsibility - which provides independent analysis of the UK's public finances - believes a no-deal Brexit would cause a UK recession.\n\nTo cushion some of the impact, the government is looking at what might happen in a worst-case no-deal scenario. This includes:\n\nborder delays\n\nincreased immigration checks\n\nless food available\n\npossible price increases for utilities, food and fuel\n\nImage copyright Gareth Fuller/PA Image caption A section of the M20 had been reserved exclusively for lorries, as part of no-deal Brexit plans\n\nA week after taking office, Mr Johnson pledged an extra \u00a32.1bn specifically to prepare for leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nPrior to this, the government led by Mrs May had promised \u00a34.2bn to prepare for a range of Brexit scenarios.\n\nBusinesses have been encouraged to prepare by stockpiling in case supplies are disrupted.\n\nSupporters of no deal say some of the risks have been exaggerated and that previous warnings have proven unfounded.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "What people really mean when they talk about leaving the EU without a Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8C0C/production/_107225853_mediaitem95286510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
