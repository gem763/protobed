But, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ready for that. I think we have a ways to go yet,\u201d Trump said.\n\nKim, in the letter sent in the third week of August, spoke of his \u201cwillingness\u201d for a third summit and extended an invitation for Trump to visit the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source.\n\nTrump on Aug. 9 said he had received a \u201cvery beautiful letter\u201d from Kim.\n\nBut U.S. officials have not said anything about a second letter in August.\n\nTrump and Kim have met three times since June last year to discuss ways to resolve a crisis over North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programs, but substantive progress has been scant.\n\nTheir first two meetings were formal summits, the second of which, in Vietnam in February, broke down after they failed to narrow a gap between U.S. demands for North Korean denuclearization and a North Korean demand for relief from sanctions.\n\nThey met for a third time on June 30 in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas and agreed to restart working-level talks but that has not happened.\n\nSince the June meeting, North Korea has several times tested short-range missiles.\n\nThe U.S. State Department and the North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.\n\n\u2018THREATS AND HURDLES\u2019\n\nAn unidentified director-general for U.S. affairs at North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday he hoped a \u201cgood meeting\u201d with working-level U.S. officials would take place \u201cin a few weeks\u201d.\n\nBut whether a meeting would lead to a \u201ccrisis or chance\u201d was up to the United States, the official said, calling for a more flexible approach.\n\n\u201cThe discussion of denuclearization may be possible when threats and hurdles endangering our system security and obstructing our development are clearly removed beyond all doubt,\u201d the official said in a statement carried by North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, said last week Pyongyang was willing to have \u201ccomprehensive discussions\u201d late this month.\n\nTrump subsequently said he would be willing to meet Kim at some point this year.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, asked about the newspaper report, said there were \u201cdetailed explanations about such a letter\u201d but declined to elaborate.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Panmunjom, South Korea, June 30, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo/File Photo\n\nKang said it could be \u201ctoo much to expect\u201d that Trump and Kim would meet before any working-level talks.\n\n\u201cNo agreement was reached between the two leaders in Hanoi even after working-level negotiations,\u201d Kang told a parliamentary panel.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of the success of another summit, their working-level teams should meet and have primary discussions on the outcome of the summit,\u201d Kang said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declined to comment on a newspaper report that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had invited him to visit Pyongyang and said conditions were not ready yet for such a visit.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430276930&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F00B", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
