He currently owns a little over one fifth of WeWork.\n\nSoftBank has also agreed to extend him a $500 million loan to repay a credit line from JPMorgan Chase & Co, as well as pay him a $185 million fee for a four-year assignment as a consultant to WeWork, one of the sources said.\n\nIn August, WeWork filed for a splashy initial public offering. This week, it was struggling for survival as it has been quickly burning through the cash on its balance sheet.\n\nThe IPO was abandoned in September as investors balked at sky-high valuations - a deal in January had tagged its worth at $47 billion. The rescue by SoftBank now values it at just $8 billion.", "description": "WeWork is planning to cut as many as 4,000 jobs as a part of a turnaround plan put in place by top shareholder SoftBank  after it took control of the company this week, sources said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20131604-0-image-a-2_1571923326908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
