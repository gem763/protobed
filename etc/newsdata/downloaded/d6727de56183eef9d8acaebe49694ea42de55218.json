Michele Sprovara, Deputy Secretary-General of Rome of the Coisp police union, stated that officers are in great need of reinforcement, Italian newspaper Il Giornale reports.\n\n\u201cWe are understaffed and, of course, there is always the problem that those we arrest today, tomorrow they find themselves back on the streets to commit exactly the same crimes,\u201d Sprovara said.\n\nA large number of the criminals operating at the station are migrants, many from North Africa such as 12 Algerians migrants, legally residents of Spain and France, who were recently arrested for committing crimes at the station.\n\n\u201cBy now, they have understood that here they can do everything: steal, get drunk, break bottles. It has become no man\u2019s land,\u201d said Alessandro Vallocchia, spokesman for the Esquilino Monti Defence Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is a situation completely in disarray. Anything can happen to you,\u201d Mr Vallocchia added.\n\nMigrant Stabs Christian After Noticing Crucifix Necklace https://t.co/N8dFnUGmtt \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 24, 2019\n\nAuthorities have made some progress with enacting barriers to remove some homeless vagrants. However, the Via Giolitti, the street to the south-west of the station, has been taken over by drug dealers who accost those at nearby fast-food restaurants.\n\nSeveral major incidents took place in the area in recent months including the robbery of a Five Star Movement senator and an Italian judge just last month. The two men were said to have been robbed by a gang of three Algerian youths who were later arrested by police.\n\nIn April, another North African migrant, this time from Morocco, was arrested after stabbing a Georgian homeless man at the station because of a heated argument over the Georgian\u2019s crucifix necklace.", "description": "Locals have sounded the alarm over the deteriorating situation at Rome's largest train station, with some calling it \"no man's land\".", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-112768116-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
