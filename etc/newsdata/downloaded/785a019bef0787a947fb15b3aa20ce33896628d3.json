Her proclaimed goal was to expand gun rights in Russia \u2013 where they are restrictive \u2013 but she was ultimately nabbed by the FBI in July 2018, and faced allegations of conspiring to infiltrate the lobby group to promote Russian interests in the US.\n\nFollowing her arrest, she spent nine months in custody, mostly in solitary confinement \u2013 a treatment that was described as exceedingly harsh and even amounting to torture \u2013 before pleading guilty to acting as a foreign agent without registration. The gun activist was eventually sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russian gun activist Butina to touch down in Moscow Saturday after US prison release \u2013 envoy\n\nButina is being transferred from a federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to a migrant center in Miami where she will board a plane to Moscow and arrive in the Russian capital on Saturday morning. The repatriation of Butina is being overseen by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which did not provide any details on the matter, citing the need to protect \u201coperational security.\u201d\n\nMoscow denied any involvement with Butina and condemned her treatment in US prisons. President Vladimir Putin called her trial and sentence \u201ca travesty of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad that finally, after very long delays, the American justice [system] made the decision that we sought,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters.\n\nButina had merely become \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in the ongoing anti-Russian hysteria and repeated attempts to find evidence of 'collusion' in President Donald Trump\u2019s actions, independent journalist Martin Summers believes.\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019ve got her caught up in this, they\u2019ve got to think of something she's supposedly done. And she hasn\u2019t done anything that could be classed as spying. We\u2019ve now got to a ridiculous situation when any Russian person who comments on Western politics is accused of being some sort of agent for their own security services,\u201d Summers told RT.\n\nBeing in prison was hard for Maria both physically and psychologically, and the first thing she needs to do is rest and recover, her father, Valery Butin, told RT.\n\n\u201cEvery single day of imprisonment for any person would have been a very severe psychological trauma,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMasha is a strong person; she never lost her fortitude even though she was held in solitary confinement for months. Nevertheless there are problems, for sure.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com More Russiagate unraveling? Ex-CEO says FBI instructed him to have relationship with Maria Butina\n\nThe time in prison was not only hard for Maria, but for her family as well. Despite receiving the good news, there is still \u201cuneasiness\u201d in their hearts, her father said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how we would get through this, but we did it. Our dream is to be together, this is our biggest dream \u2013 to meet Masha, hug her, to feel that she is here. To get the whole family back together,\u201d her mother Irina said.\n\nLike this story?
