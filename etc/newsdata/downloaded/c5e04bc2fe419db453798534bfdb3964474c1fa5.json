He now heads Mr. Lafazan\u2019s re-election campaign. As the youngest campaign manager in Nassau County, Mr. Serota dedicated his summer, as well as his weekends through the Nov. 5 election, to leading Mr. Lafazan\u2019s internship programs.\n\n\u201cYoung people are told that because they don\u2019t have a vote, their voices don\u2019t matter,\u201d Mr. Serota said. \u201cWe are showing that the opposite is true here.\u201d\n\nThe unpaid internship combines education, collaboration and fieldwork to give the students a sense of how local politics work. Each student is assigned to one of three teams: research and policy; communication; and social media. Students report on current events and policy positions weekly\u2026\n\n\u201cHere I\u2019m part of a team, and I feel like my stance on issues is really validated,\u201d Lily said. \u201cParkland was a real wake-up call that young people were the ones that were going to have to do something to make a change,\u201d she continued, referring to the student activism that erupted after the mass shooting in 2018 at the Florida high school. \u201cThat\u2019s what sparked me to realize that I was the perfect age to start getting involved.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Nyregion Josh-Lafazan-Nassa-County-Teenagers.Html"], "top_image": ""}
