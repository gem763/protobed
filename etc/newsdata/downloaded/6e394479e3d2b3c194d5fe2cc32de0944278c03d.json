The new technology would indeed make for a device that folds inward as a compact square.\n\nWhile Samsung did not make any formal announcements for what sounds very much like a Motorola 2.0, the teaser seems to confirm similar news leaked earlier this year by Bloomberg.\n\nCiting anonymous sources, the report said that the company was planning to release a new square foldable phone for 2020, with a 6.7-inch display and a more affordable price tag. The current Galaxy Fold ships at $1,980.\n\nThis new candidate to Samsung's foldable devices catalogue shows that the firm is trying to cement its lead over competitors in the booming foldables market.\n\nWhile the Galaxy Fold has already hit shelves, Huawei's own take on a foldable phone, the $2,400 Mate X, isn't expected to start shipping outside of China before next month after several delays.\n\nMotorola is also teasing a foldable screen in a new version of its Razr phone, which is rumored to launch in November \u2013 months after the initial summer release date it had announced.\n\nSEE: PC or folding phone? Here comes your next big device dilemma\n\nFoldable screens are much more delicate than traditional ones, and scratch more easily because they are made of plastic. Concerns have also been raised about how resistant they are in the long-term, and whether they can sustain repeated usage.\n\nIt still remains to be seen whether Samsung has cracked that equation.", "description": "If you have fond memories of your old flip phone, there is reason to be excited about the new form concept for the Infinity Flex Display that Samsung teased at its annual Developer Conference this week.", "authors": ["Daphne Leprince-Ringuet"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/30/928408a5-d422-4320-8131-58a19dbf513b/thumbnail/770x578/e17c4b16d1061458cda45399ac6d3b4c/samsung.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
