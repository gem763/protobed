It\u2019s a name that puts the fear of God into everybody when you\u2019re playing them because they have been forever and a day the best team in the world. But there\u2019s also a bit of excitement when you hear the name. You want to play the best, you want to see the best play, and you want to see where you\u2019re at yourself by playing a team like the All Blacks. Yes there is fear, but there\u2019s an excitement around it, it gives you a lot of energy just being involved with such an unbelievable team and its exactly what England will be feeling on Saturday when they run out in a World Cup semi-final.\n\nI remember the last time we beat the All Blacks well. It may be seven years since that day at Twickenham but those memories remain as clear now as they did then. We\u2019d lost a few games before it, Stuart Lancaster was under a bit of pressure and we were all under a lot of pressure to get a win.\n\nWe were at home and it always helps being at Twickenham. New Zealand had been on this long winning run, it was their end-of-year tour and the last game of the season for them, so a lot was going right and in place for us to do well. We also had a certain Manu Tuilagi who was absolutely pulling up trees that day. He definitely added to that and thank goodness he\u2019s playing for us this weekend!\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

I\u2019d like to think that your mentality doesn\u2019t change no matter who the opponent is, but because of the success the All Blacks have had, you know in your head that you have to go up a level. You wouldn\u2019t have thought about South Africa any differently, but when it comes to an All Blacks game, you know you\u2019re going to get everything bang on, otherwise they will catch you out.\n\nYou have to cover everything that you can in your head, and be in an even better place than you\u2019ve ever been before concentration-wise to make sure you\u2019ve got your job right.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He said a few times that they would use what was said in the press to motivate them, and that\u2019s why I like what Eddie Jones has done this week in trying to put all the pressure on New Zealand by bigging them up. It\u2019s a great idea not because when you big them up they do seem to get an advantage, but because teams who have tried to give them some negativity end up getting absolutely hammered. When I asked Ma\u2019a I could see from his face that they want you to disrespect them because it gives them energy and complete focus, and Eddie hasn\u2019t given them that. I love that.\n\nWhen you face New Zealand, they don\u2019t need too much bigging up so you have to focus on yourself a little bit, but Eddie\u2019s taken all that pressure off the team by taking an attitude towards the press of saying \u2018let\u2019s just go play and see what happens\u2019. But in camp, I know fully well that it will be the absolute opposite on the agenda.\n\nLooking back to 2012, I didn\u2019t recognise during the game that we were on the verge of something special. It was not too dissimilar to the autumn just gone if I\u2019m honest \u2013 we were ahead at half-time and we had a good lead, and then they come back with this purple patch of tries. You feel the momentum shift and go towards the All Blacks, and no matter who the opposition is during the game you feel when the momentum shifts, and we definitely had that with them. But the thing with the All Blacks is when they have that 10-minute period, you have to stop it as soon as possible and hope that the scoreboard is still in your favour or close enough that you can still get more points and that day we managed to plug that gap.\n\nIt was Manu who got the intercept and scored the try that just changed the whole momentum of the match to put us back in front again and just too far ahead for them to catch us \u2013 thankfully \u2013 because you always know they can do that.\n\nWe really should have won last autumn too. Courtney was just offside on that charge down and we just couldn\u2019t get the momentum back off them and they held out, and that was the difference on the day. Manu was able to do that back in 2012 but in the autumn we just weren\u2019t able to wrestle that back off them.\n\nIt\u2019s so frustrating that Courtney was declared offside. Of course I\u2019m going to say no way was it offside because I wanted us to win but they\u2019re the fine margins that will probably decide who wins this weekend. Half a foot, half a shoelace onside, and it\u2019s a win and it\u2019s a great day for us, but the All Blacks just find a way to win by keeping their composure to then get themselves back in front.\n\nYou have to try put them off and distract them from their plan. We were able to do that because of the weather, and because a lot of Ben Youngs\u2019s box-kicks were completely on the money. We had such a strong defence to put them completely off their game plan, and you have to be able to maintain that. If you give them one chance, it doesn\u2019t matter who it is, they\u2019ll take it. In that game we probably gave them two chances and that was it, it changed the game on its head.\n\nBut for the boys who haven\u2019t beaten New Zealand, they can take more than enough out of that game to believe they\u2019re beatable. Being so close like that, what was a whole new experience for the lads is now the knowledge that you give a little bit more and you stop them. When they come for those tries, if you stop that straight away \u2013 which I think they can especially with this back row that they\u2019ve got \u2013 I\u2019m hoping that we can do a job on them.\n\nI think Eddie\u2019s got the team right too. You can\u2019t do so well in such a good quarter-final performance and then make loads of changes. With George Ford and Owen Farrell it\u2019s always going to be up for debate isn\u2019t it? Someone\u2019s always going to have an opinion on that 10-12 axis but Eddie obviously sees something in it this weekend. He said quite openly that he wanted to change the team against Australia and it worked, so who\u2019s to say that he\u2019s wrong this week for changing it back around? You can\u2019t really argue with it because of the way that they performed.\n\nGeorge has been playing really well and I\u2019m sure everyone was pretty disappointed for him to miss out on the starting line-up last weekend so I\u2019m glad he\u2019s back in, it\u2019s a very different line-up and a different way to play but it\u2019s been working for England and I don\u2019t see it as a bad thing.\n\nI also think Tom Curry has had an absolutely outstanding tournament but I\u2019m not surprised in the slightest. He\u2019s been bubbling away for the last 18 months or so and he is an absolute animal at the breakdown. England have had a few of them over the years at seven and he\u2019s mentioned that Richard Hill\u2019s helped him in some way since he\u2019s was at school, though I don\u2019t know if he actually went to school, I think he just got told to do ruck drills every day by his dad!\n\nPlaying and training with England has brought his game on so much so quickly. He\u2019s carrying well, he\u2019s a lineout option now, and one of the reasons for that change is he was chasing too many rucks. Him and Sam Underhill seem to have found a way to master that to find the time and save a little bit of energy so you can give 100 per cent when the time is right, and it\u2019s been a great story so far of those two playing together. Tom deserves everything he\u2019s had at the tournament so far. His tackling has also been ferocious and he fully deserves his place in the team. I wish them all the best for the semi-final and I\u2019m sure England can get the job done.", "description": "It\u2019s a special name because it\u2019s not what they\u2019re called, yet we all know them as the All Blacks.
