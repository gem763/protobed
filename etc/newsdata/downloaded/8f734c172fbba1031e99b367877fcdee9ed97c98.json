The Coalition spent more money than that simply on buying books, including pro-Trump ones written by Bossie himself. Some donors told Axios that they thought they were donating to Trump\u2019s re-election effort when giving to Bossie\u2019s group.\n\nThere are few slights that anger the president more than the perception that somebody is profiting off his name, especially if that money could have benefited his 2020 campaign or his personal business empire. Within just hours of the Axios story publishing, the president instructed aides to punish and publicly lash out at his 2016 deputy campaign manager.\n\nThe news infuriated the president so much that, as The Daily Beast reported in early May, he directed his senior campaign staff to draft and release a statement rebuking Bossie. Though at least one earlier draft of the statement included Bossie\u2019s name, the final draft\u2014which was issued by the Trump campaign\u2014shamed Bossie but did not specifically name him.\n\nThings got worse for Bossie in the weeks that followed. Not only was he for a time persona non grata in Trumpworld, but one of his employers, Fox News, kept him off the air for nearly three months. Three sources familiar with the circumstances said that the cable exile was executed by network brass in part to avoid infuriating the president, who watches Fox News and Fox Business in large quantities.\n\nThe fall out between Trump and Bossie was all the more remarkable considering the role the latter played during the homestretch of the 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. Bossie, who Trump once called \u201ca friend of mine for many years,\u201d was critical to Trump\u2019s upset victory and later was given a slot on the presidential transition. But by then, he had made too many enemies in Trumpworld and among the Republican elite to land a top post in the administration or at the Republican National Committee.\n\nAs the friction between Trump and Bossie has lessened, Bossie has gone back to appearing on both Fox networks, and meeting and playing nice with the president. But even if Bossie has started to patch things up with Trump, it doesn\u2019t seem as though the Trump adviser is ready to forgive Axios for reporting on his shenanigans.\n\n\u201cAxios is working overtime to be the worst in the fake news business,\u201d Bossie posted to Twitter last week, quote-tweeting Trump\u2019s complaint about how the recent \u201cstory by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, two sources familiar with President Trump\u2019s comments confirmed Axios\u2019s nuke-the-hurricanes reporting.", "description": "The former top aide was on the outs after reports of self-dealing.
