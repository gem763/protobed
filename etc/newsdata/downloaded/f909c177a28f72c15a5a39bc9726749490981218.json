BA 2.99% delivered 18 jetliners in August, leaving the aerospace giant on track for its lowest annual total in eight years.\n\nThe plane maker said Tuesday that it delivered 276 planes through August compared with 481 at the same point in 2018, trailing analysts\u2019 revised estimates for about 500 deliveries in 2019. It handed over 64 planes in August 2018.\n\nDeliveries were halted after two 737 MAX planes crashed, with the second accident in March leading regulators to ground the aircraft globally.\n\nThe MAX crisis interrupted a multiyear aerospace boom, prompting the cancellation of thousands of flights, denting airline profits and threatening jobs in Boeing\u2019s global supply chain.\n\nBoeing has suspended financial guidance for the year and warned in July that it might slow or halt production of its 737 MAX jet if regulators don\u2019t approve its return to service by the end of this year.\n\nChief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said at the time that while Boeing plans to continue producing 42 of its 737 jets a month, including the MAX, and to boost that rate to 57 next year, any slippage in the timeline for the return of the MAX could prompt the company to reduce output.\n\nMost MAX operators such as Southwest Airlines Co. don\u2019t expect the plane to return to service until December or January. Some, such as Ryanair Holdings PLC, have already cut planned flying next summer because they don\u2019t expect to have sufficient planes.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can tell you this is uncharted territory,\u201d Steven Udvar-H\u00e1zy, executive chairman of Air Lease Corp. said at an industry conference last week. The plane-rental giant has received 15 of the 165 MAX jets it has ordered.\n\nBoeing shares were up 2.1% Tuesday at $366.16, while the S&P 500 was off 0.6%. The shares have traded within a narrow range in recent weeks, in part because analysts expect a surge in deliveries next year, while airlines continue to make progress payments to bolster the company\u2019s closely watched cash flow.\n\nHowever, Brazil\u2019s Gol Linhas A\u00e9reas Inteligentes SA said last week that it had suspended deposit payments to Boeing. It has received seven of the 129 MAX jets it ordered. Boeing declined to comment on customer issues.\n\nThe company hasn\u2019t updated its July guidance for securing approval for the MAX to fly again early in the fourth quarter, allowing it to resume deliveries. But Boeing has yet to submit the required changes to the scrutiny of global regulators.\n\nMr. Muilenburg is due to update investors at an industry conference on Sept. 11.\n\nRival Airbus SE, which is set to overtake Boeing in terms of deliveries this year, shipped 42 planes in August, taking its year-to-date total to 500. Airbus has secured 95 orders so far this year, after cancellations.\n\nBoeing booked nine orders last month, including two 737 business jets. It booked no MAX deals for the sixth month in succession, though it has 4,544in backlog.\n\nThe company has also suffered setbacks in other programs, with 787 output at its North Charleston, S.C., facility closed for four days last week because of Hurricane Dorian. Testing of its delayed 777X jet has also been interrupted after a testing failure last week. Boeing said Tuesday that the problem wouldn\u2019t have a significant impact on its testing or delivery schedule.\n\nRelated Video Two crashes and the global grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX commercial airliner led to extensive disruption in the international aerospace industry.
