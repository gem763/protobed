Still, it would be wise for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to give the president an opportunity to climb down from his obstructive position.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe could do so by offering him terms for an impeachment proceeding similar to those adopted during previous investigations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton \u2014 not because the House must do so but to assure Republicans and the American public that the process will be transparent and fair. Ms. Pelosi ought to hold a vote by the full House to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry. And the White House should be offered, in return for its cooperation, privileges that were granted to Mr. Clinton, such as allowing his counsel to participate in hearings and rebut charges.\n\nA letter sent to the House by the White House counsel Tuesday falsely claimed that the current impeachment inquiry is illegitimate because those procedures had not been adopted. Again, nothing in the Constitution requires them. But the more open and balanced the impeachment investigation is, the more likely it is that Americans \u2014 and perhaps some congressional Republicans \u2014 will conclude that Democrats are right to consider Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior an offense potentially justifying his removal from office.\n\nIf, in spite of a full House vote and procedural concessions, Mr. Trump persists in his refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas for documents and seeks to prevent testimony by individuals, the merit of an impeachment charge for obstruction of Congress will be made manifest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats need not comply with every GOP demand. Because the Ukraine investigation is being conducted by the House, rather than by a special prosecutor or other outside party, it is reasonable that some preliminary interviews and depositions be carried out in private. Republicans should not be granted unrestricted subpoena power, since their past actions show they are liable to abuse it for political purposes.\n\nNevertheless, Ms. Pelosi should strive to construct the most open and accountable process that is possible in a polarized Congress and with a president who disregards his oath of office. The Democrats have a mountain of facts on their side. They should do as much as they can to allow the public to perceive them clearly and without distractions.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Witnesses on Ukraine are coming forward.
