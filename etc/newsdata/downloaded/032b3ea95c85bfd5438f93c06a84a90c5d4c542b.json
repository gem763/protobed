(Baltimore Orioles)\n\nTo say the Baltimore Orioles have struggled in recent years is an understatement.\n\nTheir miserable 54-108 record this season was the second worst in Major League Baseball behind the hapless Detroit Tigers, and only a slight improvement from last season, when the O\u2019s finished 47-115, dead last. The franchise is attempting a major rebuild, and as expected, its abysmal winning percentage has correlated with sinking fan attendance at home games.\n\nOriole Park at Camden Yards seats nearly 45,600 spectators and is still considered one of the most beautiful stadiums in the sport. But the ballpark saw its worst attendance in team history this past season, according to the Baltimore Business Journal \u2014 and on average, 64 percent of the stadium\u2019s seats remained empty.\n\nYet through the countless trials and tribulations of recent seasons, some fans have remained loyal season ticket holders. Such die-hards return to the ballpark again and again despite having very few reasons to celebrate.\n\nThis week, however, some of these fans will get special recognition. A random selection of Orioles season ticket holders will receive a handwritten note from a player on the team, thanking them for their support in trying times.\n\n[\u2018Winning doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 So what brings fans to see the tanking, dreadful Orioles?]\n\nThe plan was conceptualized by Kristen Hudak, director of public relations for the Orioles, who ran the idea by team leaders and players before carrying it out, The Athletic first reported. About 30 players on the team were asked to take a pen to Orioles\u2019s stationery, and their letters should arrive soon to local mailboxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what the reaction would be. The guys that I spoke to about it were immediately supportive. I saw many of them sit down and start writing right away. It felt like they had something on their minds or something they wanted to say and that was an opportunity for them to do it in a heartfelt way,\u201d Hudak told The Athletic. \u201cAnd then, when I started to collect them, I was just really touched and moved by their answers and the time that they took to be thoughtful.\u201d\n\nThank you notes are a time-honored way to show gratitude but require both patience and care. The messages didn\u2019t come easy for everyone, Hudak told The Athletic \u2014 and there was \u201csome collaboration\u201d as players brainstormed the best way to thank their most loyal fans. Hudak said even players whose native language isn\u2019t English requested to participate, and with the help of translators, reliever Miguel Castro and outfielder Anthony Santander were able to show their thanks, too.\n\nSome notes were just a couple of sentences, while others featured more lengthy prose. The common theme? Thanking fans for sticking with the team, and promising that better times will arrive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some games were tough for you as a fan, but things will be back to the way they were soon enough!\u201d third-baseman Rio Ruiz wrote in his message to a fan named Ron. \u201cHope to see more of you in the next coming seasons. Many blessings!\u201d\n\n\n\nThird-baseman Rio Ruiz's letter to a season-ticket holder named Ron. (Baltimore Orioles) (Dan Kubus/Dan Kubus/Baltimore Orioles)\n\nRuiz told The Athletic he sympathizes with fans who may be frustrated. But he and his teammates share a sense of optimism and pride they want to instill in the letters\u2019 recipients.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like losing. But there\u2019s been something about this whole year that\u2019s been positive,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cAnd it just all started in the clubhouse. If we can reiterate that to the fans, I think it kind of gives them a perspective and a better outlook on what\u2019s to come.\u201d\n\nPitcher Dillon Tate offered a similarly optimistic outlook, telling season-ticket holder Larry he\u2019s \u201cconfident that things will improve.\u201d\n\n\n\nPitcher Dillon Tate's letter to a fan named Larry. (Baltimore Orioles) (Dan Kubus/Dan Kubus/Baltimore Orioles)\n\n\u201cAs you probably have seen, there is work to be done. I\u2019ve learned this year that one\u2019s outlook on any given situation has a lot to do with the result,\u201d Tate wrote. \u201cProgress is progress, no matter how little. The O\u2019s are moving in the right direction!\u201d\n\nTate told The Athletic he sends handwritten notes regularly, and his latest one raises a strong point: The Orioles improved their win total by seven games this season and they have one of the youngest rosters in the league. There\u2019s almost nowhere to go but up.\n\nIf the team wants their most faithful fans to keep showing up in the meantime, a personal, handwritten appeal likely won\u2019t hurt.\n\nRead More MLB:\n\nThe Nats picked wrong time to show the worst of themselves in Game 1 of NLDS\n\nHow to stream the entire MLB postseason\n\nMLB playoff bracket and schedule\n\nLow-budget Rays bust into postseason filled with high-priced behemoths\n\nDavid Ortiz to rejoin Fox MLB broadcast four months after being shot", "description": "About 30 season-ticket holders will receive notes with a common theme: Thank you for sticking with us, and the best is yet to come.", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Am", "Michael Brice-Saddler Is A General Assignment Reporter.
