The 1-6 New York Jets and the 0-6 Miami Dolphins both traded away key players Monday, a day ahead of the league\u2019s trade deadline.\n\nTheir plan is clear: With the season lost, it\u2019s time to focus on the future.\n\nThe Redskins, however, aren\u2019t like most teams.\n\nHalfway through the season, the 1-7 Redskins don\u2019t appear to have any desire to commit to a full-scale rebuild. Interim coach Bill Callahan is not ready to turn the starting job over to rookie Dwayne Haskins. The front office, according to reports, isn\u2019t interested in trading veterans like Ryan Kerrigan and Brandon Scherff for draft picks.\n\nBut in one change, the Redskins are now open to letting left tackle Trent Williams go, after months of resisting trade talks amid the Pro Bowler\u2019s holdout. The NFL Network reported Monday Washington is listening to offers for Williams, though its asking price remains high.\n\nAsked about a potential Williams trade, Callahan said it would be unfair to speculate.\n\nRunning back Adrian Peterson, though, said Tuesday\u2019s deadline has created \u201cuncertainty\u201d within the locker room, given the team\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re 1-7 and you got teams that are out there that are in a lot better positions we\u2019re in. I\u2019m sure looking like, \u2018Hey, we could use this guy, we can use that guy\u2019 to see if this team, other teams are interested,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all part of the business.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Redskins have opened themselves up to criticism with their approach.\n\nFans are frustrated by, what they feel, is the Redskins\u2019 inability to fully accept their standing in the league. Team president Bruce Allen was mocked when he said he believed the team\u2019s culture was \u201cdamn good\u201d after firing coach Jay Gruden earlier this month. On Friday, Callahan received backlash for comparing Haskins\u2018 situation to Steve Young and Aaron Rodgers having to wait to play in San Francisco and Green Bay.\n\nThe key difference \u2014 and this should go without saying \u2014 is that Young and Rodgers had to wait behind Joe Montana and Brett Favre, two Hall of Famers. Keenum, by no means, is close to that. There\u2019s a strong argument to be made that game reps would be the most beneficial for Haskins, especially since the Redskins are far from contention.\n\nSo why are the Redskins so hesitant?\n\n\u201cWe started a course at the beginning of the year philosophically and we\u2019ve held true to that course in terms of where we\u2019re at right now currently and we\u2019re going to maintain that,\u201d Callahan said Monday. \u201cI really believe at the beginning of the year, Case earned the starting quarterback position. He was voted captain by his teammates, certainly deserving, certainly our starting quarterback.\u201d\n\nCallahan\u2019s answer can be nitpicked. Gruden admitted publicly that it was Colt McCoy, not Keenum, who was on track to win the starting job before the 33-year-old hurt his leg in camp.\n\nBut that ignores the larger point: the Redskins don\u2019t feel like Haskins is ready to play. And that\u2019s a problem for a player they drafted 15th overall.\n\nEven then, there\u2019s a chance Haskins could start Sunday in Buffalo.\n\nKeenum suffered a concussion in last week\u2019s loss to the Minnesota Vikings, and the Redskins are waiting to see if he can pass the necessary tests in the concussion protocol.\n\nIn case Haskins does have to play, the first-rounder is taking the steps to be ready. He walked in the locker room, later than the rest of his teammates on Monday \u2014 having spent extra time on the practice field, throwing to wideout Darvin Kidsy.\n\nIn two appearances this season, Haskins has underwhelmed. He threw three interceptions in a Week 4 loss to the New York Giants and went 3 for 5 with an interception in Thursday\u2019s defeat to the Vikings.\n\nCallahan said Haskins had a \u201creally good day\u201d of practice on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shown the willingness and the diligence to improve,\u201d said Callahan, who noted he met with Haskins this weekend individually. \u201cHe\u2019s taken it upon himself to come in and visit and talk and to express himself in terms of what he can do better.\u201d\n\nDespite the praise, it will be up to Callahan when Haskins gets the job on a full-time basis. Allen said as much when he announced Gruden\u2019s firing three weeks ago.\n\nAnd asked what sort of direction he has received from the front office on Haskins\u2018 development, Callahan had a simple answer.\n\n\u201cNone,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
