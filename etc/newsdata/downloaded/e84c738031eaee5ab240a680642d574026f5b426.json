Unfortunately, the Core Four were too distracted by having sex in adjacent rooms (at least we have, collectively, outgrown the seductive, mildewy charms of the bunker) to set an alarm.\n\nPrincipal Weatherbee\u2019s meaner, crankier replacement, Mr. Honey (who, if he is indeed related to Miss Honey, definitely inherited more of the Trunchbull side\u2019s DNA), is displeased by their tardiness. But Mr. Honey soon finds an arch-rival in Cheryl, when he cancels her much-anticipated back-to-school dance. \u201cAt the last student dance multiple students were murdered,\u201d he explains, which, honestly, is not an unfair point? Undeterred, Cheryl decides to host an equally wholesome back-to-school kegger.\n\nOperating in his unofficial capacity as county truancy officer, Archie recruits his boxing-slash-juvenile-inmate-trafficking best bud Mad Dog \u2014 pardon me, Monroe \u2014 to enroll in Riverdale High and join the Bulldogs. Reggie is, to say the least, not on his American Teen Princess Football Captain best behavior, exhibiting a great deal of hostility toward the newest, strapping-est young lad to arrive on the team.\n\nAt practice, some football happens, and I should warn you that I have a very specific form of psychogenic blindness that prevents me from understanding anything about this sport unless (a) they can ever find a way to make TV\u2019s magical floating first-down line happen in real life, (b) I am housing buffalo wings like Dionysus eating grapes, or (c) Tim Riggins.\n\nReggie\u2019s dad, observing from the sidelines, calls his son over and berates him for being outperformed, footballingly sports-wise, by Monroe. It\u2019s not long before Reggie, conspicuously wearing sunglasses, at night, indoors, underground, reveals himself to have a nasty shiner. And at the next practice, when they hut the ball, or whatever, Reggie apparently does a bad job again because his dad marches right onto the field to threaten him, in a cool and normal parental fashion. This explicit display of abuse is lost on no one, not even Archie.\n\nMr. Chipping, a judge from a writing contest that Jughead didn\u2019t win, was nevertheless impressed enough by his story that he invites our little Jug Kerouac to transfer to schmancy Stonewall Prep to study writing with him. Despite Jughead\u2019s skepticism, FP insists he at least take a tour. There, the cafeteria serves \u201cvegan, keto vegan, and raw keto vegan\u201d options and students seem genuinely interested in Moby Dick, which I, for one, find highly suspicious. Jughead \u2014 or as his would-be new Stonewall classmates insist on calling him, Forsythe \u2014 is inspired, though not inspired enough to ditch Riverdale High, or Betty.\n\nBetty\u2019s been keeping busy too, doing some light Mindhunting with her and her boyfriend\u2019s half-brother. Alice has apparently missed a number of her scheduled check-ins with Charles, who is distractingly hot, I\u2019m sorry, it needs to be said. At Charles\u2019s urging, Betty cultivates Kevin \u2014 who has recently apologized for, among other things, aiding in the attempted forced lobotomy of his ex-best friend \u2014 as an asset, given that FBI surveillance has found that he\u2019s in communication with Fangs, who is still very much a part of the Farm.\n\nAnd so she feeds Kevin some fake intel \u2014 that the FBI found a witness to testify against the Farm \u2014 and tails him as he, predictably, meets with Fangs to spill this particular bean. Kevin is seemingly genuinely hung up on a boy, not a cult; Fangs is seemingly more interested in squeezing his ex for as much information as possible than squeezing him, you know, romantically.\n\nCharles dismisses Kevin as a possible source, but Betty disagrees. In fact, she takes what seems like the wild and unnecessary gamble (but then again, I\u2019m not a 17-year-old junior apprentice FBI agent with my very own secret decoder ring) of telling him that her mom is an undercover agent, and requests that he find out whatever he can from Fangs by feeding him Penelope Blossom\u2019s name as the fake witness. For now, it appears Kevin is cooperating as she hoped: He reports that Fangs took him to the Farm\u2019s current hideout, in an abandoned motel beyond the \u201cmaple barrens\u201d (everyone\u2019s favorite episode of The Sopranos). He didn\u2019t see Alice, but did see Edgar, who\u2019s amassed an alarming stockpile of weaponry.\n\nCheryl\u2019s back-to-school party at Thornhill very nearly veers into Weekend at Bernie\u2019s territory, given that she\u2019s done a poor job of concealing her My Decomposing Dress-Up Twin\u2122 doll (life-size! Wheelchair not included!) under a sheet with his hand sticking out. But before Jason can join the festivities, FP arrives to break them up \u2014 someone named Honey called to complain about the noise, he tells the hostess. Lo and behold, the next day at school, a beehive dripping messy CGI honey finds its way onto the principal\u2019s desk.\n\nWith Archie by his side, Reggie steadies himself to take a stand against his monstrous father \u2014 and against Mr. Mantle\u2019s bright-red convertible with MGNFCNT plates (which my broken brain initially interpreted not as \u201cmagnificent\u201d but as, somehow, \u201cmy very educated mother just served us nine pancakes\u201d). \u201cSometimes I think he loves this car more than he loves me,\u201d Reggie tells Archie, evoking Cameron from Ferris Bueller pathos, before smashing it with a baseball bat. After that, Reggie tells his friend that his dad won\u2019t be coming to practice anymore, and the two boys swear to remain \u201cbros for life\u201d \u2014 which would look pretty great engraved on one of those BFF heart necklaces, for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nThe tabloids can\u2019t resist the Lodge family\u2019s swirling legal drama, which means Veronica is being swarmed by press even at school. Mr. Honey confronts her about an unnamed inside source (who is definitely, for sure Hiram) claiming she\u2019s responsible for her father\u2019s crimes in an article on Riverdale.com. (I could not be more excited to tell you that the IRL Riverdale.com is not some cute inside jokey CW redirect (or a www.creedthoughts.gov\\creedthoughts situation), but the extremely unsexy internet headquarters of Riverdale Mills, a \u201cleading American manufacturer of premium quality welded wire mesh fabrics for the marine, security, construction and agriculture industries.\u201d) The principal suggests she take a sabbatical from school. In a rude way, to be clear, not in a nice way.\n\nVeronica finally relents when paparazzi come banging down her apartment door: She\u2019ll hold one and only one press conference, at the Le La Bon Bonne Nuit. First, though, she performs \u201cAll That Jazz\u201d in a sequined leotard for the assembled reporters. (Personally, I would have gone for a more thematically relevant \u201cWe Both Reached for the Gun,\u201d or at least a \u201cRazzle Dazzle.\u201d Based on Archie\u2019s mysterious fluency with The Wild Party, I\u2019m sure he can handle Billy Flynn.) Was this number a bizarre, even inexplicable thing for Veronica to do \u2014 for Riverdale to do? Obviously. But, look: This is season four, and it\u2019s going to take more than one sort-of-non-but-actually-diegetic musical-theater number to rattle us. We made it through the Heathers episode.\n\nVeronica announces that, yes, she did the wrongs that hard-hitting local news outlet Riverdale.com (soon to be acquired by Gannett) accused her of, but \u201cunder duress\u201d from her father, and that she won\u2019t testify on behalf of either of her imprisoned parents. Veronica even decides to adopt her mother\u2019s maiden name for the purposes of her Harvard application. The name on everybody\u2019s lips is gonna be Gomez.\n\nAfter sitting through an overcrowded English class full of paper-airplane-hurling students who clearly didn\u2019t do the summer reading \u2014 and, maybe more troublingly, in which the teacher doesn\u2019t notice Betty and Jughead getting up and leaving the room with neither explanation nor apology \u2014 Betty tells her boyfriend he should transfer. It\u2019s only after Jughead dons his uniform for his first day at Stonewall that FP reveals that Grandpa Forsythe briefly studied there, too, but dropped out. In this case, FP stands for Foreshadowing, Please!\n\nCut to spring break, an eerie flash-forward that echoes the last scene of the season finale: A search team scours the forest for Jughead. I look forward to seeing if our good, good writer boy gets The Secret History\u2013ed, or at the very least A Separate Peace\u2013ed.", "description": "Welcome to senior year.
