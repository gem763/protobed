You're reading the CBC Arts newsletter, and if you like what you see, stick around! Sign up here, and every Sunday we'll send you a fresh email packed with art, culture and a metric truckload of eye candy, hand-picked by our small and mighty team. Here's what we've been talking about this week.\n\nHi, art lovers!\n\n\n\nGet ready for a big, juicy behind-the-scenes slideshow from Season 2 of In the Making. The production team went and gifted us with a massive folder of photos from their travels to Iqaluit and Japan and Vancouver and Montreal and a frequent-flyer-elite-status-qualifying list of other places in between, and really, the timing couldn't be better.\n\n\n\nThe documentary series returns in mere days, and you can watch all eight fresh episodes on CBC Gem starting Friday, Sept. 27. Scroll to discover which Canadian artists they'll be profiling this time around, and if you happen to be anywhere near Toronto, Montreal or Vaughan, Ont., just a reminder: there are still a few stops left on the show's free screening tour. (All the info is on the show's Facebook page.)\n\nOn to those photos!\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures 2019)\n\nYou'll spend time with a few musicians this season, including 2018 Polaris Music Prize winner Jeremy Dutcher. Here, Dutcher is joined by song carrier Maggie Paul in Fredericton.\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures 2019)\n\nPersonally, this is the episode I'm most excited to watch (and if you've read this Guardian profile of Beverly Glenn-Copeland \u2014 or if you just grew up watching Mr. Dressup \u2014 you'll understand where I'm coming from). What bits of his incredible life story will they capture in this half-hour doc?\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures 2019)\n\nGlenn-Copeland is going through a major career renaissance, and the guy on the left, record collector Ryota Masuko, was the catalyst. In the episode, the musician makes a trip to Japan to meet him.\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures)\n\nThat's performance artist Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory (right). In the Making travelled to her home in Iqaluit where she was developing new work.\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures 2019)\n\nAny Wendy fans out there? The comic's creator Walter Scott (right) joins host Sean O'Neill.\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures 2019)\n\nChristopher House is the longtime head of Toronto Dance Theatre. In the Making covers his final season with the contemporary dance troupe.\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures 2019)\n\nThat's the CBC Archives in Vancouver. Deanna Bowen returns to her hometown in this episode to research a new work involving her family story and the history of race relations in Canada.\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures 2019)\n\nAlso in Vancouver, Ken Lum! That's the artist (right) with host Sean O'Neill. They're standing in front of Lum's piece A Tale of Two Children.\n\n(\u00a9 White Pine Pictures 2019)\n\nAnd for anyone who caught Rebecca Belmore's Facing the Monumental (or just wishes they had), this will be a must-watch. In the Making was in Saskatoon with the artist as she opened the career-surveying exhibition at the Remai Modern.\n\nYou've got to see this\n\nA performance 2,300 km in the making - The first-ever Toronto Biennial of Art launched Saturday with a bunch of free events along the waterfront, including this performance from the Embassy of Imagination, a youth collective from Cape Dorset, Nunavut. The event was the final leg of a procession they began up north. Read all about it (and check out more of their work at the biennial's exhibition site on Lake Shore Blvd. until Dec. 1).\n\nSurviving on perogies - Whether you learn anything from Tamarra Canu's trip to the world's largest perogy is kind of beside the point. Will it make you hungry, though? Absolutely. Watch the latest episode of Big Things Small Towns (and please pass the sour cream).\n\nHow did they make that movie look so good? - Production designers from movies including The Lighthouse and Ford v Ferrari spill trade secrets in this conversation recorded during TIFF. Johanna Schneller, host of The Filmmakers, moderates their discussion.\n\nFollow this artist\n\n(Instagram/@jessbellphotography)\n\nJess Bell (@jessbellphotography) - So, I definitely featured this video about Jess and her super photos of super dogs a couple weeks back \u2014 but because so many of you clicked on it (because dogs), I thought I'd do you a solid and show you where to follow her on Instagram. You're welcome.\n\nGot questions? Typo catches? Story ideas?\n\n\n\nWe're just an email away. Send us a note, and we'll do our best to get back to you.\n\n\n\nAnd if someone forwarded you this message and you like what you've read, here's where to subscribe for more.\n\n\n\nBefore I go, a quick heads-up for all you regular readers: I'll be taking a break from the newsletter next week, but it'll be back soon. (Maybe catch up on CBC Arts: Exhibitionists while you wait?) Expect the next mail-out on Sunday, Oct. 5.\n\n\n\nUntil then!\n\nXOXO, CBC Arts", "description": "Watch all eight episodes on CBC Gem starting Friday, Sept. 27.", "authors": ["Leah Collins Is The Senior Writer At Cbc Arts."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292224.1569013824!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/in-the-making-season-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
