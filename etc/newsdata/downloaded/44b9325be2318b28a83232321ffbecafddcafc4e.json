Unfortunately, in some \u00admoments, we didn\u2019t see that. Now I don\u2019t want anyone hiding, not me, not them. It is a moment for us to go and play football and to take \u00adresponsibility as well.\n\n\u201cIn the second half, I didn\u2019t see that ability and in some moments many players were hiding and didn\u2019t give solutions. I want \u00adeveryone there \u2013 football is about playing and showing strong \u00adcharacter. No one can hide. No one, I am always here for you, I am \u00adalways here for our fans, I will not hide, no one can hide.\u201d\n\nSaturday's defeat at home to Sheffield United means Everton have now lost three of their past four Premier League matches this season Credit: PA\n\nA section of Everton supporters booed the team at the end of the Sheffield United defeat and Silva now faces the task of trying to keep his players, as well as the fans, on side. While there is sympathy for Silva in some quarters, following a summer in which no central \u00addefender was signed and the club\u2019s transfer strategy appeared \u00admuddled, there are also issues for the Portuguese to address.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest of those appears to be the mental fatigue some players are feeling as a result of his long, tactical training sessions and \u00adpreference for his squad to stay in a hotel before all games.\n\nThere is also a sense that he is failing to inspire his team and dwells on bad results for too long, rather than quickly lifting his \u00adplayers.\n\nSilva has been attempting to solve his team\u2019s inability to defend set-pieces with little improvement. Since the start of last season, Everton have conceded 20 goals from corners and free-kicks \u2013 more than any other Premier League team.\n\nThe problem has resulted in Silva making his squad practise defending set-pieces for repetitive sessions of up to an hour long at times, but there is a feeling they have \u00adbecome counterproductive.\n\nDefensive lapses have cost Everton dear so far this season such as with this Lys Mousset goal for Sheffield United on Saturday Credit: Reuters\n\nIndividuals have become bored during set-piece practice and switched off to the instructions they are being given. Those not \u00addirectly involved have to hang around and can lose concentration.\n\nSilva likes to keep his players at the training ground for long periods, but groups of them are used to more intense sessions under past managers or at former clubs.\n\nHe also prefers the squad to stay together in a hotel before home and away games, meaning players will often only have a couple of hours to return home after a Friday session before having to meet up again, which can be unpopular.\n\nSilva\u2019s demeanour on the touchline has been commented on by frustrated fans, who would like to see more passion, and questions have been asked over whether he can motivate his players.\n\nSources claim the 42-year-old stews on bad results and is not an inspiring character on the training pitch or in the dressing room. The situation has not yet hit crisis point, but Everton face a critical fortnight before the international break in which they travel to Championship club Wednesday, host Manchester City and visit Burnley.\n\nSilva admitted the Wednesday game had become \u201creally important\u201d, but refused to give any clues over whether he would make wholesale changes.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have to look at \u00adrespecting the competition, respecting our goals for that competition and what we want to achieve in it. We have to be strong, we want to go to the next round, so that is what we want, a reaction in this game.\u201d", "description": "Marco Silva has accused his \u00adEverton players of \u201chiding\u201d ahead of a \u00adpotentially crucial run of games, starting with Tuesday's\u00a0Carabao Cup trip to Sheffield Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mxxjSCc9AgRo9JBJhvuBjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7dm2FebGHaB1.Rxp2w86NA--~B/aD0xMDM2O3c9MTY1ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/efeb66d8e177c42d7c78c32da7bb57f8", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
