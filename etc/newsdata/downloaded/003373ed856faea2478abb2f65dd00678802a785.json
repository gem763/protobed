He and his \u201cBusch Light Supply Needs Replenished\u201d sign got picked up by ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d broadcast on Saturday morning \u2014 and raised $400 in just an hour.\n\n\u201cI made the sign as a joke, and just hoped maybe a couple of people in the crowd would see the sign and maybe toss me $20 so I could get a case of Busch Light,\u201d King, an Iowa State fan, told MarketWatch. But after raking in $600, King and his family decided to donate the windfall to the rival University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital, which is adjacent to the football field in Iowa City. (In fact, during Iowa home games, fans do the \u201cIowa Wave\u201d for the kids watching the game from the hospital windows.)\n\nKing\u2019s mom and his brother shared his fundraiser and Venmo handle (@Carson-King-25) on Facebook FB, +0.03% and Twitter TWTR, +0.00% \u2014 and that\u2019s when the donations really started pouring in.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, King told MarketWatch that people had donated almost $34,000 to his fund. And if brewer Anheuser-Busch BUD, -0.07% and Paypal-owned PYPL, -1.77% money-sharing app Venmo both match the donations, as they have pledged to do on Twitter, the Busch Light lover will be handing over about $100,000 to the hospital (minus the cost of a case of Busch Light, he cracks, which runs $15 or $16.) Individuals have donated as little as 25 cents, and as much as $300, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s turned into something really cool, and a way to help families and to help the kids,\u201d said King, who has taken a break from his studies to work as a casino security officer, and pay down some of his student loans. \u201cIt\u2019s getting shared around the country, and we\u2019ve had people from Canada and Australia [donate.] I actually got a message from someone in Poland on Facebook today, saying how great this story is.\u201d\n\nKing has some fundraising experience under his belt; he has raised between $300 and $400 for the same children\u2019s hospital by kicking up his heels in the Iowa State Dance Marathon. But his beer sign fundraiser is in a different league.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because he was savvy enough to tweet at Anheuser-Busch and ask them to match the total number of donations that he collected. And the brewer is game, tweeting back that \u201cthis is the best thing we have read all year\u201d and offering to match the funds, and even throw in some beer\n\n.@CarsonKing2 this is the best thing we have read all year, we\u2019re inspired.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re going to match your donation to University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, and we\u2019ll throw in some of that Busch Light you were looking for. https://t.co/NPPrPp6zJg \u2014 Busch Beer (@BuschBeer) September 17, 2019\n\nVenmo caught wind of the impromptu fundraiser, and offered to match the donations, as well. A company spokesperson told MarketWatch that, \u201cWe\u2019re constantly amazed by the kindness of the Venmo community and what they\u2019re able to achieve together, which is why we felt inspired to match the donation.\n\nWe see a lot of great stories, but this is one of our favs @CarsonKing2. Count us in for matching the donation to the hospital, too. #ftk\ud83d\udc9b@BuschBeer @CollegeGameDay https://t.co/thS8JXOXC3 \u2014 Venmo (@venmo) September 17, 2019\n\nAnheuser-Busch did not respond to MarketWatch requests for comment by press time. But Amy O\u2019Deen, the interim executive director of the children\u2019s hospital, said in a statement provided to MarketWatch that, \u201cWe are delighted that Carson has so thoughtfully decided to donate these funds to help the pediatric patients and families served by the UI Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital. This organic effort demonstrates the generosity and goodness of Iowans, uniting Cyclone and Hawkeye fans to make a difference for our kids. We are grateful for that support and for the matching gifts.\u201d\n\nKing plans to present the grand total, which he expects to top six figures, to the hospital sometime next month. \u201cThey were really excited, they were so happy when I called to get ahold of someone, and we\u2019re talking about having me take a tour of the hospital and meet some of the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible to see what kind of a difference you can make when people band together.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll drink to that.", "description": "Anheuser-Busch and Venmo are matching donations to the University of Iowa children\u2019s hospital.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR540_busch__ZG_20190918114605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
