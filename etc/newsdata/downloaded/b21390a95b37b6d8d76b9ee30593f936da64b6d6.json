They call it a payoff.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s financial firm scored a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China just days after he traveled with his father for a visit to the country in 2013.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden confirmed in June to ABC News that Biden remains in his position despite questions about his role at a Chinese investment fund.\n\nTrump posited that the cozy relationship that Hunter Biden had with China was part of the reason that China enjoyed good relations with former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably why China, for so many years, has had a sweetheart deal, where China rips off the USA,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president also repeated his call for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, when asked again by reporters what he thought Ukranian officials should do with Biden.\n\n\u201cI would think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens.\u201d\n\nTrump said that Hunter Biden was obviously not qualified for the board position of a Ukranian energy company as his father was leading a crackdown on corruption in the country.\n\n\u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked, that was a crooked deal 100 percent,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden flatly denied Trump\u2019s allegations in a speech on Thursday, insisting that he did nothing wrong in Ukraine.\n\nHe berated Trump for asking the Ukrainian president to investigate him, calling his conversation an abuse of power.\n\n\u201cHe did it because like bully in history he\u2019s afraid, he\u2019s afraid of just how badly he will be beaten in November\u2026 of 2020,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe former vice president pushed back against Trump\u2019s accusations in a speech on Thursday, vowing to stay in the race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said to Trump. \u201cYou are not going to destroy me and you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend Mr. President or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d\n\nBut Trump told reporters that Biden was \u201cgoing down\u201d because of the obvious corruption in China and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think that Biden is going down and I think this whole situation, because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scammed, just like they scammed China and Ukraine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd basically who are they really scamming? The USA and that\u2019s not good.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump said Thursday that China should investigate Hunter Biden and his father former Vice President Joe Biden for corruption.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/china-joe-biden-links-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
