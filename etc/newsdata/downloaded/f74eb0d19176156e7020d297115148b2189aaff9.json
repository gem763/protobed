Tulsi Gabbard changes course on impeachment inquiry", "language": "en", "text": "Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 previously a lone holdout among the crowded field of 2020 presidential hopefuls \u2013 says she has changed her mind about an impeachment inquiry after reading the transcript of President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urging the foreign leader to help with looking into claims against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nInterested in Donald Trump?

Add Interest\n\n\u201cUp to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already badly divided country,\" Gabbard said Friday in a press release from her campaign. \"However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine\u2019s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump\u2019s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent.\"\n\nGabbard said she worries if she doesn't support the impeachment process, future presidents and other federal leaders may get the idea that its OK to abuse their position for personal gain without repercussion.\n\nShe is one of two millennials and the first female combat veteran to run for president. However, in recent days, the spotlight has focused less on her accomplishments and more on her divergent opinion on impeachment compared to other candidates amid the race for the White House.\n\nAlex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBut now, the tides have changed as she joins the growing list of lawmakers and presidential candidates in support of impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf we allow the president to abuse his or her power, then our society will rot from top to bottom. We will turn into a banana republic, where people in positions of power\u2014from the president all the way down to the traffic cop\u2014will feel it's okay to abuse their power with no consequences,\" Gabbard said. \u201cThis is not the kind of country that any of us want to see.\"\n\nGabbard may have changed course in this impeachment process, but she continued to defend her argument against impeachment as a whole. She said the inquiry must be swift, thorough, and narrowly-focused and cannot be turned into \"a long, protracted partisan circus\" that would further divide the country and undermine democracy.\n\nIn the past, she said it should have been the American voters who decided at the ballot box to vote him out.\n\nIn July, the congresswoman told ABC News that impeachment \u201cwould only further divide a terribly divided country. It further emboldens me and my conviction about why I'm running for president because I believe that we need to defeat Donald Trump in 2020.\u201d\n\nIn June, after a visit to Homestead Detention Center in Homestead, Fla., Gabbard was asked about her appeal to voters. She talked to ABC News in an exclusive interview about how her approach was different from the then two dozen Democratic contenders in the race.\n\n\u201cI'm not talking about politics, as usual. I'm not just out there giving a stump speech. I'm out there laying out what's in my heart. And why I'm running for president not because I just want to be president, but actually why I'm running for president who I'm fighting for, and everything that's at stake.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who is a major in the Hawaii National Guard added, \u201cAt no time Is this about me. It's about people who are gathering there, it's about people in this country and people who I'm asking for the privilege and trust to be able to serve.\u201d\n\nScott Eisen/Getty Images\n\nIn recent days, Gabbard had been a relatively lonely voice taking a position that put her in direct odds with fellow 2020 candidate Tom Steyer. Steyer\u2019s press secretary Alberto Lammers told ABC News on Monday, \"anyone who doesn't come out for impeachment now is playing political games.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Andrew Yang one of the last 2020 candidates to come out in support of impeachment came to Gabbard\u2019s defense. Yang told ABC News' Senior Washington Reporter Devin Dwyer that her stance on impeachment shouldn\u2019t disqualify her from running for office.\n\nYang said that after taking the Senate Republican majority into account, \"it\u2019s a reasonable stance to say this might not end up not being the right move.\u201d\n\nGabbard held a packed town hall in Atlanta, with a few hours notice for her supporters on the last day in August. She had failed to make the debate stage for the third ABC News Debate, but that didn\u2019t stop hundreds of her supporters for showing up to support her.\n\nWearing a red pant suit she took questions from the audience ranging from climate change to foreign policy.\n\nShe called on a man to ask a question. When pointed at him he looked nervously over his shoulder. He stood up and identified himself as one of her Republican supporters who voted for Trump in 2016.\n\nGabbard welcomed him by saying \u201cBut you're here now, buddy.\u201d\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fixing it,\" he said.\n\nThe room erupted in applause.\n\nThat moment has stuck with Gabbard on the campaign trail where she has mentioned it several times in recent days. She stressed partisanship is what\u2019s wrong with the political process now.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAt every one of our campaign events. We have Democrats, Republicans, independents, libertarians, almost everyone,\" Gabbard said.\n\nHer campaign, Gabbard has said, isn\u2019t speaking to just Democrats or Republicans. She\u2019s speaking a \u201cmessage of unity, of coming together of leaving no one behind.\u201d\n\nThis week, Gabbard qualified for the upcoming fourth debate and surpassed the donor threshold weeks ago.\n\nIn recent days, at least two candidates \u2013 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro \u2013 have admitted they don\u2019t have the 165,000 donor threshold needed to make the debate stage in November.\n\nBack in June, Gabbard told ABC News that she looked forward to letting people get to know her and her positions, even on positions that aren\u2019t popular with the rest of the field of Democratic contenders.\n\n\"But you know,\" she told the gathering, \"my mission is to always talk straight and let people know who I am, how I feel where I stand on the issues, and call it like it is.\"\n\nABC News' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report.", "description": "Gabbard, previously a lone wolf against impeachment, joins the growing list of democrats supporting the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/tulsi-gabbard-03-as-gty-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
