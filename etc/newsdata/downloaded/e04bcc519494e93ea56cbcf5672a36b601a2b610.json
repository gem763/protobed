The people of Northern Ireland will be in charge of the laws that they live by, and \u2013 unlike the backstop \u2013 will have the right to end the special arrangement if they so choose. #GetBrexitDone #TakeBackControl \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 17, 2019\n\n\u2018Take back control\u2019\n\nCritics of Theresa May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement said it essentially tied the UK to EU laws without giving the country any influence over them.\n\nAnalysts say that while much of the new deal is unchanged, a key difference is the trading relationship the UK will have with the EU after Brexit.\n\nThe new deal has scrapped the UK\u2019s commitment to a \u2018single customs territory\u2019, confirming the need for checks at the border.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, goods will not attract tariffs if they satisfy \u2018rules of origin\u2019 checks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nITV\u2019s Joel Hills says this will make some UK/EU trade more costly.\n\nPolitical Declaration is out. Much of it is unchanged but gone is commitment to \u201ca trading relationship on goods that is as close as possible\u201d. Instead a \u201cfree trade agreement\u201d. This matters.
