A number of disabled people taking part in the protests say they believe they were deliberately and aggressively targeted by police.\n\nIn one incident, police arrested a carer who came to help a seriously ill woman in a wheelchair adjust her oxygen tank as she protested outside New Scotland Yard.\n\nNicki Myers, an organiser of the XR Disabled Rebels group, said: \u201cAfter about an hour, I needed a carer to come and adjust my supplemental oxygen and get some medication that was in the bag on the back of my wheelchair.\n\n\u201c[Another wheelchair user] came down to do that for me and as soon as they arrived, we became an illegal assembly under section 14 and were arrested.\u201d\n\nMyers and other disabled people had been demonstrating to demand the return of independent living equipment confiscated by the Met during the initial stages of the XR protests.\n\nEquipment confiscated by police included wheelchairs, disability ramps, noise-cancelling headphones, specially adapted toilets and other items intended to make protest sites accessible to disabled people, according to sources within XR.\n\nIn its letter to the Met, the DIAG said: \u201cThe actions of the MPS [Metropolitan police service] have not been received well by the disabled and deaf community, many of whom now fear that their legal right to participate in peaceful protests can no longer be exercised if their mobility equipment is to be confiscated, and personal assistants/carers arrested.\n\n\u201cThe effect on the relationship between the MPS and members of our community is at risk of irreparable damage. The actions in the last few weeks will have long-lasting consequences for our community and will take many years to heal.\u201d\n\nNovis said she had heard \u201chorror stories\u201d from disabled people taking part in the demonstrations, some of whom she thought may have cases against police for discrimination or violation of human rights. In one case, she said, a blind protester was released without his cane and left to make his own way home.\n\nMartin Marston-Paterson, an XR legal observer and a member of the Rainbow Rebels group, said information collected by the legal team suggested police were targeting disabled protesters as a \u201cdeliberate intimidation tactic\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn the legal team, we were prepared for violence and collating reports of police violence. What we had not anticipated was that most of those reports would be against disabled protesters, and that is a definite pattern we have determined coming through.\u201d\n\nWhen Marston-Paterson, who has cerebral palsy and arthritis, was arrested in Trafalgar Square, he says he was the only one out of 10 kept handcuffed for the journey to the police station and police confiscated his walking stick.\n\n\u201cAt the police station, the officer justified it on the grounds that he thought it might have been a weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like a medical cane, it\u2019s not decorative or aesthetic, it\u2019s just a metal cane.\u201d\n\nIn response, the Met said it \u201cdoes not single out or disproportionately target any group or community. If those involved in an assembly to protest break the law, they are liable to arrest.\u201d", "description": "Force\u2019s disability advisers lodge complaint about treatment of Extinction Rebellion protesters", "authors": ["Damien Gayle", "Jessica Rawnsley", "Tim Newburn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0608491f2f1c81a06ad1a2fcc1554c2778c19af8/0_190_5266_3160/master/5266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08e9d094609ee7df629671b7781cc8e4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
