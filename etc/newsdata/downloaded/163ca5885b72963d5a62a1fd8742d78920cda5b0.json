Data released on Tuesday showed the US manufacturing sector contracted in September to its weakest level in more than a decade.\n\nStocks fell broadly on the report, and GM's share price was down more than three percent.\n\nThe strike had previously forced GM to lay off at least 2,000 Canadian workers and temporarily close an engine plant in Mexico. Many suppliers have halted or scaled back operations.\n\nJPMorgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in a research note that the strike has cost GM over $1bn, but that the company may be able to recover some lost profit in the fourth quarter. He said GM has $82m a day in lost profit.\n\nGM in Mexico said that \"for the moment\" its three other Mexican plants \u2013 in Ramos Arizpe, San Luis Potosi and Toluca \u2013 are working normally. A spokesman in Mexico said the plants still had parts available, but the company could not say how many more days the plants would remain open.\n\nThe spokesman declined to estimate the daily cost of suspending operations at the Silao complex.", "description": "Labour action could cost United States automaker $1bn, as union workers receive small fraction of regular salaries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/a598d9cdb0b34a19be737633ca3da711_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
