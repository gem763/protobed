The companies argued that the two stood a better chance to compete against AT&T and Verizon (disclosure: Verizon owns TechCrunch) as a single entity. After considerable back-and-forth, the deal was approved by the Justice Department in July. With the FCC\u2019s blessing, the only hurdle is a multi-state lawsuit that both companies have vowed to resolve before the deal closes.\n\nThe report states that Democrats Rosenworcel and Starks dissented in today\u2019s vote, with Republicans Ajit Pai, Brendan Carr and Michael O\u2019Rielly voting in favor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all seen what happens when markets become more concentrated after a merger like this one. In the airline industry, it brought us baggage fees and smaller seats. In the pharmaceutical industry, it led to a handful of drug companies raising the prices of lifesaving medications,\u201d Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement, noting she did not vote for the merger. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think this time will be different. Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that the T-Mobile-Sprint merger will reduce competition, raise prices, lower quality, and slow innovation.\u201d", "description": "Today, the Federal Communications Commission formally approved the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile in a 3-2 vote falling along party lines, The Verge reports.
