The group secretly rehearsed for a month before the Green-Jones' big day.\n\nAll their hard work paid off when the performance time came.\n\nRobert Rinehardt III/TheChancellorsCloset\n\n\"Everyone was surprised at the wedding. No one knew, so there was a lot of cheering, a lot of yelling. It was great,\" Isaiah, 29, said.\n\nThe three-minute performance featured songs like Beyonce's \"Before I Let Go\" and Lil Nas X's \"Old Town Road.\"\n\nThe Lil Nas X song hold significance to the couple \"because it is sung by an openly gay black male artist,\" said Isaiah.\n\nDeron Patterson/Supreme Optics Photography\n\nIsaiah posted the video of their dance on Instagram, where positive comments poured in for the happy couple.\n\n\"Online, there was a lot of support. I think people felt inspired ... because this video showed a little piece of light in the midst of a lot of negative energy out there,\" said Isaiah.\n\nTaylor agreed, adding that they hope their video shows others \"the importance of supporting folks and celebrating love, no matter what that looks like.\"", "description": "A newlywed couple proved that they are both partners in life and dance with an epic flash mob at their wedding.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/reception-1-ht-er-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
