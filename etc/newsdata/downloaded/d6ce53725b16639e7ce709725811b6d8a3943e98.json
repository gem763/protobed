App makers say it could devastate their businesses.]\n\nAfter an inquiry from The Washington Post last month, Apple delayed the rule changes pending discussions with developers.\n\nOn Thursday, Apple amended those rules to allow children\u2019s app developers to use analytics software \u201cin limited cases,\u201d provided the services don\u2019t collect or transmit personally identifiable information about children or data that could be combined with data from other sources to identify them later.\n\nUnder the revised rules, advertising will be allowed, as long as it has been vetted for appropriateness.\n\nGerald Youngblood, whose app, Tankee, offers a kid-safe alternative to YouTube for video game streaming, said he welcomed the changes Apple made Thursday. \u201cWe appreciate Apple listening to the kid tech community and developing policies that benefit kids while supporting the growth of responsible developers in this space,\" he said.\n\nThursday\u2019s developments were first reported by TechCrunch.", "description": "Apple modified privacy rules that developers of apps for children said would hurt their ability to make money and improve their products.", "authors": ["Reed Albergotti", "Reporter Covering Consumer Electronics", "Reed Albergotti Is The Washington Post'S Consumer Electronics Reporter", "Taking Readers Inside Powerful", "Secretive Companies Such As Apple", "Shedding Light On The Murky", "Global Industry Responsible For Building The Myriad Devices That Touch Every Aspect Of Our Lives.
