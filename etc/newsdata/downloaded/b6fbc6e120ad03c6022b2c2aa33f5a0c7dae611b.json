According to the Beast, employees came and went as the day continued on and topped off at around 30 concurrent workers. Someone claiming to be a Blizzard employee posted a photo of workers sitting beside the statue on the r/Hearthstone subreddit, where it was met with praise from members of the Reddit community.\n\nEarlier this week, Blizzard banned professional Hearthstone player Ng \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Wai Chung from participating in tournaments for a year after he yelled a pro-Hong Kong slogan during a post-game interview. \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!\u201d Blitzchung said with his mouth covered by a mask similar to what the protesters wear themselves.\n\nBlizzard is also withholding any winnings Blitzchung would have received for his participation in this past weekend\u2019s Grandmasters tournament.\n\nIn addition to its own employees, Blizzard has been blasted with criticism from lawmakers, other game developers, and its player communities. On Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said, \u201cBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d He continued, \u201cNo American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\u201d\n\nEpic Games, the developer of Fortnite, told The Verge that it would support the speech rights of its players and refuse to ban them for their political beliefs. \u201cEpic supports everyone\u2019s right to express their views on politics and human rights,\u201d a company spokesperson said.", "description": "The employees met at a giant statue depicting an Orc Warrior outside of the Activision Blizzard offices.
