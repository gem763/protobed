Ted Deutch of Florida, who introduced the legislation with Republican Rep. Vern Buchanan, also of Florida.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received support from so many Americans from across the country and across the political spectrum,\u201d Deutch said, reported ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m deeply thankful for all of the advocates who helped us pass this bill, and I look forward to the Senate\u2019s swift passage and the President\u2019s signature.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. House just passed the #PACT Act, legislation that I introduced with my colleague @RepTedDeutch to criminalize animal abuse. This important piece of legislation would make animal cruelty a federal offense. Great news for my fellow animal lovers! pic.twitter.com/fK4qAppXnK \u2014 Rep. Vern Buchanan (@VernBuchanan) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cThe torture of innocent animals is abhorrent and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d Buchanan said as well. \u201cPassing the PACT Act sends a strong message that this behavior will not be tolerated.\n\nThe bill expands upon the 2010 Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, which initially criminalized the creation and distribution of animal crush videos.\n\nThe PACT Act would make it a federal crime for \u201cany person to purposely engage in animal crushing in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe legislation continues:\n\nIt shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly create an animal crush video, if\u2014(A) the person intends or has reason to know that the animal crush video will be distributed in, or using a means or facility of, interstate or foreign commerce; or (B) the animal crush video is distributed in, or using a means or facility of, interstate or foreign commerce.\n\nViolators would be subject to criminal penalties, including a fine, a prison term of up to seven years, or both.\n\nThe measure provides exceptions for unintentional killing of an animal as well as conduct or videos of \u201ccustomary and normal veterinary, agricultural husbandry, or other animal management practice,\u201d \u201cthe slaughter of animals for food,\u201d and other practices such as hunting, trapping, fishing, predator or pest control, scientific research, protecting a person\u2019s life or property, and euthanizing an animal.\n\nIn response to the legislation, pro-life organization March for Life Action tweeted the bill is \u201cgood news for animal lovers\u201d and asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to \u201cshow the same respect and offer protections for unborn humans and those born alive after an abortion.\u201d\n\nThis is good news for animal lovers @SpeakerPelosi Can you show the same respect and offer protections for unborn humans and those born alive after an abortion? #LetThemVote #Endinfanticidehttps://t.co/kAacVReo1n \u2014 March for Life Action (@MFLAction) October 23, 2019\n\nHouse Republicans held a hearing in September on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, legislation that seeks to protect babies born alive after abortion from infanticide.\n\nHouse Democrats have refused to take up the measure, H.R. 962, which states infants who survive abortion deserve the same treatment and care as any other newborn.\n\nPelosi and other Democrat leaders have blocked a vote on the bill more than 80 times.\n\n70% of Dems agree: if a baby is born alive during an abortion attempt, they should be given medical care. @RepHaleyStevens, as a #ProLife Michigander, I call on you to sign the discharge petition to allow a vote on the Born Alive bill to #EndInfanticide! \u2014 Debbie Goelman Smith (@48161debster) October 23, 2019\n\nHouse Republican Whip Steve Scalise (LA) and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) filed a discharge petition on the legislation in April that requires more Democrat signatures in order to bypass Pelosi and force a vote on the Born-Alive Act.", "description": "The House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill Tuesday that would make certain types of animal cruelty a federal felony.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/dogs-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
