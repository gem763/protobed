Although there\u2019s an old-fashioned English feel to this lavish five-star hotel, with Gainsborough silk-lined walls and a royal warrant, there\u2019s a surprisingly homely atmosphere and friendly staff who make children feel welcome. The personalised service is special: children can expect teddy-shaped cakes, a perfectly selected welcome gift tied beautifully with ribbon and card bearing their name, and a bedroom strewn with cuddly sheep toys (The Goring\u2019s mascot is Barbara the sheep). The utmost delight was elicited by a wooden chest filled with immaculate fancy dress costumes.\n\nParents can take a breather while children decorate cakes with the chef and make mocktails with the bartender; they return laden with treats. It\u2019s part of the Bring the Family offer, which allows you to book two adjacent or interconnecting rooms for 50 per cent off the children's room. Mini fluffy bathrobes and slippers, baby toiletries and bath mats are provided. There\u2019s an extensive children\u2019s menu in the Michelin-starred restaurant, a library for children, and the concierge will advise on family-friendly attractions.

There\u2019s also free ice cream for children who complete the hotel\u2019s fun family trail. The Food and Flicks package is ideal for rainy days: unlimited films for 24 hours plus a delicious, generous spread of duck fat-cooked chips, homemade chunky fish-fingers, dough balls with garlic dip, pizza wheels, fruit with chocolate dip and a Coke float.\n\nThe location means children can run around Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park and its excellent Diana Memorial Playground, and the hotel loans Mini Micro scooters plus helmets. The Science Museum and Natural History Museum are a short walk away, too. Choose from connecting rooms or executive rooms large enough for two adults and two children. If parents opt for breakfast, children will get it for free.\n\nRooms from \u00a3260\n\nroyalgardenhotel.co.uk\n\nNeighbourhood: West End\n\nThis hip five-star hotel has a bright, friendly atmosphere that matches Kit Kemp\u2019s colourful and quirky interiors. Ideal if you\u2019re seeing a show as a family, the Haymarket is in the heart of Theatreland. The generous welcome amenities for children are highest quality and tasteful: mini bathrobes and slippers, cookies and milk in bottles with striped paper straws at bedtime, a specially chosen gift and book, organic toiletries, plus a voucher to be exchanged for ice cream or a fruity drink tailor-made by the bartender. Children are welcome in the hotel\u2019s lounges where there are games for all ages; smiley staff are happy to provide additional entertainment. The children\u2019s menu in the Brumus restaurant offers the usual chicken goujons and burgers, but with healthy sides of broccoli or salad, and the choice of a fruit bowl for dessert.

It\u2019s why this hotel, comprising Victorian townhouses and a quiet courtyard set back from the bustle of Victoria, was named Best Family Hotel in the World in the 2019 Hotel of the Year Awards. Our vast, neutrally decorated, contemporary two-bedroom apartment was well equipped including a playmat on which to put the activity books and crayons \u2013 within the goodie bags given to children on arrival \u2013 to use.\n\nExpect animal-themed organic toiletries for the littlest children, rubber ducks, mini bathrobes and slippers, and a turn down service with warm milk, homemade cookies bearing children\u2019s names, and sweet smoothies. Choose DVDs from the selection catering for the whole family and enjoy complimentary popcorn and soft drinks in the rooms. Don\u2019t miss the Alice in Wonderland-themed afternoon tea. Our two and four-year-olds delighted in the exquisitely decorated treats and imagination-sparking details such as tea served in owl-shaped teapots.\n\nRooms from \u00a3400\n\ntaj51buckinghamgate.co.uk\n\nNeighbourhood: Mayfair\n\nSince its 1837 opening, Brown\u2019s has welcomed illustrious guests from Winston Churchill to Rudyard Kipling (The Jungle Book was completed here). Children get their own check-in and Families R Forte passport at Brown\u2019s, in the heart of exclusive Mayfair \u2013 and that is just the start of the many surprises to make them feel spoilt. A hand-written note welcomed our two to their tent to play hideaway, while as part of the Monkey Turndown Service, a plush Jellycat monkey \u2013 the hotel\u2019s mascot Alby \u2013 sits on their bed, which is decked with embroidered bedding.\n\nThe decor here is elegant: sage greens in our room and hand-painted walls elsewhere. There is also a beautifully illustrated Albemarle storybook for bedtime reading, and milk and home-baked cookies. A popcorn machine was a fun addition to our room. A VIP membership card allows children to borrow books from the reception\u2019s \u201clibrary\u201d, while they can also expect their own toiletries and rubber ducks.

It\u2019s also environmentally friendly; water from a borehole beneath is decanted into glass bottles in the bedrooms, and there are no throwaway activity packs here - instead, a basket full of age-appropriate books to borrow, and a cuddly teddy to keep. There are also mini robes in the rooms while cots, extra beds, baby video monitors and a childminding service are available. Chemical-free Ren toiletries are gentle for the whole family. Cots and an extra bed for children aged two-16 can be added to Deluxe Rooms for free, and interconnecting rooms have their own adjoining corridor.

The rooms, neutrally decorated in cream and wood, are more businesslike than characterful, but the views over the City, Shard, Houses of Parliament or the London Eye make up for it. The mini kitchenettes with microwave and kettle make travelling with babies easier, and there\u2019s a family area for breakfast, and a children\u2019s menu.\n\nIts Family Getaway package includes a complimentary gift bag, three vouchers to be redeemed against food and drink, in-room Sky movies, accommodation for two adults and two up-to-12-year-olds in a studio double room or any of the suites, with up to 15 per cent off the best flexible rate, and breakfast for all (children eat breakfast for free).

What the hotel lacks in ambience and frills, it makes up for in comfort. From just \u00a359 a night, you get sizeable rooms with comfortable Hypnos bed \u2013 many king-size \u2013 and two pull-out or sofa beds for children, or a cot (under 16s stay for free). This branch, a short walk from the Tower of London, has nine adjoining rooms.\n\nFor children, there are in-room goodie bags containing sweets, crayons and colouring material (the artworks are then displayed on the restaurant wall), and on weekends every family room with children receives a sweet treat on their bed. Look out for themed activities taking place during some weekends, where staff dress up \u2013 think pirates or Disney. With one dining adult, children also get a free breakfast.\n\nRooms from \u00a359\n\npremierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/greater-london/london/london-bank-tower.htm", "description": "The best family-friendly hotels in London, from quirky boutiques to budget options, as chosen by our resident expert.", "authors": ["Elisa Bray"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/16/istock-1010018868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
