Bush and Barbara Bush had previously held the record). At a time when the average marriage clocks in at just over eight years\u2014and where, according to the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University, only 7% reach the 50-year mark \u2014 to exceed seven decades seems nothing short of a miracle.\n\nWhat do they know, or possess, that most of the rest of us don't?\n\nMany factors go into marital longevity, including a person's age at marriage, wealth, education level, and geographic location. An analysis of divorce trends conducted at the University of Maryland this year found that women who marry after the age of 26 are the most likely to stay married \u2014 if family finances are stable.\n\nReligion, too, may play a part: Although the Pew Research Center reports that 74% of divorced Americans are Christian \u2014 28% of whom are, like the Carters, evangelical \u2014 in one survey of long-married Americans, the center found that about two-thirds credited their successful marriages to having shared religious beliefs.\n\nBut the secret to the Carters' success might be as simple as the fact that, well, they chose to stay together. W. Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project and associate professor of sociology at the University of Virginia, has said that long-lasting couples adopt a commitment to \"marital permanency,\" as he told the Washington Post in 2016 . \"They don't see divorce as an option.\"\n\nOr, at the very least, they don't act on it. In her book \"Wedding Toasts I'll Never Give,\" the writer Ada Calhoun recounts asking her mom, in a fit of frustration with her husband, how she had stayed married. Her mother's response: \"Don't get divorced.\"\n\nThe actor Jamie Lee Curtis expressed a similar sentiment when asked about her longtime marriage to actor-director Christopher Guest. \"It's a fascinating thing,\" Curtis told Today in 2015 . \"I could write a book on marriage called 'Don't Leave.'\" She later elaborated in an interview with Good Housekeeping. \"There's a recovery phrase that says, 'Stay on the bus ... the scenery will change,'\" she said. \"I think it can apply to almost anything where you feel unhappy in that moment. I'm not a wild romantic. I'm a realist. I respect him. And I just don't leave.\"\n\nAt the core of this philosophy is an understanding that happiness is elusive, and often as much a result of a deliberate decision as it is of external circumstances. Buddhists believe that contentment is a choice, a conscious act of feeling secure with what you have, and who you are, right in the moment. The Carters aren't Buddhists, but it's not unreasonable to think this may be an attitude they share with many others who've managed to weather the ups and downs of marriage. Their partnership has endured because they chose to make it endure.\n\nJimmy Carter embraces his wife Rosalynn after receiving the final news that he'd won the presidency in 1976.\n\nWere all the Carters' years happy ones? Likely not; few peoples are. (And, of course, there are certain circumstances in which a relationship is not sustainable or safe, and there is no other choice but to exit; some marriages become toxic, abusive or simply founder. In those cases, staying put can be detrimental.) President Carter's 1980 reelection bid was unsuccessful, and studies do show that work stress can have a damaging effect on a marriage. Later, in 2012, the Carters chose to write a book together, a project that Mrs. Carter told CNN was \"a terrible experience.\"\n\nBut that unhappiness was not reason enough to quit something they obviously both chose to believe in and work to make last. The research speaks favorably on the notion of sticking it out: One study published last year found that for long-married couples, happiness tended to dip pretty intensely between 10 and 20 years of marriage but improved significantly after 20 years of marriage.", "description": "Luck?
