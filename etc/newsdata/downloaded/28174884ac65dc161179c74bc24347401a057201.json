Daniels and Stanford counterpart K.J. Costello were among the players who got knocked out of their season openers. So did Washington senior center Nick Harris.\n\nGraduate transfer Juwan Johnson, expected to start at receiver for Oregon, didn\u2019t even suit up for Saturday\u2019s big game against Auburn. And UCLA was missing several top playmakers.\n\nDaniels\u2019 injury will arguably have the biggest impact on his team. The 6-foot-3 sophomore tore a ligament and the meniscus in his right knee late in the first half of the Trojans\u2019 31-23 victory over Fresno State and will miss the rest of the season.\n\nDaniels was adjusting this season to an Air Raid-style offense under new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell and had fared well in the opener before he was hurt, throwing for 215 yards and a touchdown.\n\nNow USC (1-0) must turn to freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis. There\u2019s also the intriguing possibility that USC could lure back redshirt sophomore Jack Sears, who had announced last week his intention to enter the transfer portal after losing out to Daniels.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Jack and I always talked about, and I said, \u2018Hey, there is always an open door here,\u2019\u201d Helton said Saturday night. \u201cAnd he told me, he said, \u2018Coach, if you ever need me, I\u2019m there for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nSlovis\u2019 debut as starter might come against another QB getting his first start, Stanford\u2019s Davis Mills. The Trojans host the Cardinal (1-0) on Saturday in an early conference matchup at the Coliseum.\n\nStanford coach David Shaw said Costello is questionable for the game.\n\nCostello got a forearm to the facemask from Northwestern\u2019s Earnest Brown late in the first half Saturday. Costello, who threw for 152 yards and a touchdown before he was hurt, did not return. Brown was called for a late hit, but not targeting.\n\nShaw said Tuesday he believed the officials missed the call.\n\nMills, a junior, replaced Costello and threw for 81 yards, but he also fumbled twice and the Cardinal did not score in the second half. With the 17-7 victory, Stanford moved up two spots to No. 23 in the AP Top 25 released Tuesday.\n\nShaw, who had recruited Daniels, called the season-ending injury a shame. But he said it would not have too much impact on Stanford\u2019s preparation.\n\n\u201cOur defensive mentality is to accentuate what we do well and we talk a lot about our scheme versus their scheme, more so than who is playing quarterback,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe young man went in there last week and made some great throws and some nice plays, but for the most part for us we\u2019ve got to go in there and play to our strengths and play our style of football.\u201d\n\nJunior left tackle Walker Little injured his leg on the final drive of the game. Shaw said Stanford hopes to see Little back by midseason.\n\nOREGON\u2019S RECEIVER WOES: It was something of a surprise when Johnson was sidelined for the Ducks\u2019 season-opening 27-21 loss to Auburn.\n\nCoach Mario Cristobal said Monday that the unspecified injury occurred late last week in practice and Johnson is currently listed as day-to-day. The Ducks were already hurting at receiver with Brenden Schooler (right foot) and Mycah Pittman (right shoulder) both out. Promising freshman receiver JR Waters will miss the season with a foot injury.\n\nTo help alleviate the situation, the Ducks have moved redshirt freshman tight end Spencer Webb to receiver. Webb had three catches for 28 yards and a touchdown in the opener.\n\n\u201cHe played a lot of wide receiver or I would say a lot of detached tight end formational stuff in high school,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cSo he\u2019s very natural in space. And when the opportunity arose with all of the injuries that transpired we felt, \u2018You know what, let\u2019s give this thing a look.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Ducks also moved sophomore cornerback Daewood Davis to receiver. That\u2019s where Davis played his first year with the Ducks.\n\nOregon dropped from No. 11 to No. 16 following the loss to the Tigers. Next up, the Ducks (0-1) host Nevada (1-0) at Autzen Stadium on Saturday afternoon.\n\nWOODS INJURY: There\u2019s no word on Washington State standout linebacker Jahad Woods, who had six tackles against New Mexico State before he left the game in the third quarter with an apparent shoulder injury.\n\nBecause Cougars coach Mike Leach doesn\u2019t talk about injuries, it\u2019s unlikely his status will be updated. But Woods\u2019 backup, walk-on redshirt freshman Hank Pladson, filled in the rest of the way and had his first interception in the 58-7 Washington State win.\n\nNext up for the No. 23 Cougars (1-0) is Northern Colorado (0-1) on Saturday at Martin Stadium.\n\nUCLA HAMPERED: The Bruins were without top running back Joshua Kelley (knee), receiver Theo Howard (hand/wrist), cornerback Darnay Holms (undisclosed) for Thursday night\u2019s 24-14 loss at Cincinnati.\n\nHoward, a senior who had a streak of 28 games with a reception going into the opener, was injured for much of training camp but had recently returned to practice, as had Kelley.\n\nCoach Chip Kelly said afterward that the Bruins \u201cmade the decision we weren\u2019t going to put them out there if they weren\u2019t 100%. That wouldn\u2019t have been fair to the player and we\u2019re always going to err on the side of safety.\u201d\n\nNext up for UCLA (0-1) is San Diego State (1-0) at the Rose Bowl.\n\nMELE STEPS UP: Harris was injured in the first half of the Huskies\u2019 47-14 victory over Eastern Washington and did not return, but redshirt freshman backup Matteo Mele jumped right into the role.\n\nHarris is week-to-week with an unspecified injury.\n\n\u201cYou never know when that day is going to come where the guy\u2019s gotta go, so he (Mele) got a lot of good reps,\u201d coach Chris Petersen said. \u201cGotta keep progressing with him and Nick\u2019s week-to-week, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\n\nThe Huskies (1-0) host California (1-0) on Saturday in another early conference game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's just a week into the season and injuries are already taking a toll in the Pac-12.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
