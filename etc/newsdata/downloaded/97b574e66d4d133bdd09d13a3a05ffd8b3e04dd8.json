Nor could he have envisioned musket-bearing reenactors engaging in a mock military battle on his front lawn before huge crowds.\n\nHe undoubtedly would be surprised to find 221 years later a young preservation-minded couple pouring their passion into the house and working to engage with the community, which has welcomed them.\n\n\u201cWe came for the house,\u201d said Alex Aberle, who bought the home in April 2017 with Violette Levy, \u201cbut we\u2019re staying for the neighborhood. \u2026 Germantown and Mount Airy are two incredibly diverse, eclectic and involved communities, and for the first time, we feel inspired to meet our neighbors.\u201d\n\nThe transformation of Upsala from a home to a museum and then back to a home, is an example of how historical properties can return to their original use while still honoring their legacy. At a time when thousands of house museums are languishing, it offers a new way of thinking about how to preserve historical houses.\n\nUpsala, a seven-bedroom, two-bathroom mansion on about 2\u00bd leafy acres in the middle of an urban area, is considered one of the finest examples of Federal-period architecture in the Germantown area. But its historical value predates its existence. Twenty-one years before the house was built in 1798, the land was the site of a Revolutionary War skirmish known as the Battle of Germantown.\n\nAfter capturing Philadelphia, British Gen. William Howe had his forces set up camp in Germantown at Cliveden, a historical property across the street from where Upsala now stands. From what became Upsala\u2019s front lawn, George Washington launched a surprise attack. Although it failed, with the Americans suffering twice as many casualties as the British, it became a turning point in the war.\n\n\n\nAn illustration by G. Illman of the Revolutionary War's Battle of Germantown in 1777 near Cliveden, a property across the street from where Upsala now stands. (Library of Congress)\n\nUpsala\u2019s original owner was a wealthy Quaker, John Johnson III. His descendants remained in the house until the late 1930s when a bank took ownership, according to Tom Mayes, general counsel of the National Trust. For the next several years, it sat vacant.\n\nAfter a fire damaged the house in the 1940s, the Upsala Foundation, a group of local preservationists, raised money to restore the home and open it as museum. When the museum closed in 2005 because of a lack of visitors, Upsala once again sat largely empty for years, said Katherine Malone-France, chief preservation officer of the National Trust.\n\nThe National Trust acquired Upsala in 2005 but struggled to find a use for it. Then in September 2016, it came up with a plan. In conjunction with Cliveden of the National Trust \u2014 which was Upsala\u2019s co-steward \u2014 the house was put on the market with the goal of charting a new future for the property but also honoring its past.\n\n\n\nUpsala has served as a home and museum \u2014 and sat largely empty for a number of years.\n\nUpsala was listed with Louise \u201cButter\u201d D\u2019Alessandro and Janice Manzi of Elfant Wissahickon\u2019s Chestnut Hill office and offers were accepted for three months. Malone-France said the National Trust had worked with the brokerage before and was confident it could market historical properties with preservation easements.\n\nPotential buyers were asked to submit a statement about their preservation experience, plans for the property as well as financials. The house was listed for $499,000 and came with a preservation easement that remains in perpetuity. Future owners had to agree to allow the annual Battle of Germantown reenactment to continue in the front yard. Other restrictions protect the exterior and original interior features such as flooring, windows, window surrounds, wainscoting, baseboards, door surrounds, fireplaces and their mantelpieces, and decorative plaster moldings. The easement also protects the wide variety of mature, nonnative trees.\n\nDespite these restrictions, Upsala garnered nine offers and sold to Aberle and Levy, both 27, for $550,000. Because Upsala was a charitable property, proceeds are held by the National Trust to ensure the easements are monitored and for the ongoing care and maintenance of Cliveden, not for the Trust\u2019s general operations budget, Mayes said.\n\n\n\nViolette Levy and Alex Aberle, both 27, in the upstairs sitting room of Upsala. (Max Burkhalter for The Washington Post)\n\nAberle and Levy are no strangers to real estate. They were friends in high school in Florida, married in 2016, and have flipped four other historical properties, mostly in Brooklyn and South Philadelphia. Aberle, a native of Mahwah, N.J., is a real estate agent with a bachelor\u2019s degree in urban design and architectural studies from New York University. Levy, a native of Sarasota, Fla., has a master\u2019s degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania and is a nanny.\n\nThe couple learned Upsala was for sale while wrapping up the restoration of a home in Philadelphia\u2019s Queen Village, but felt the timing wasn\u2019t right. When that flip sold, they decided to check it out.\n\n\u201cWe were like, let\u2019s just go look at it because we\u2019re never going to be allowed back in after someone buys it,\u201d Levy recalled.\n\n\n\nThe main entryway of Upsala. The couple were struck by the scale of the space and the massive, winding staircase. (Max Burkhalter for The Washington Post)\n\nStepping inside, they were struck by the scale of the space \u2014 including 11-foot ceilings on the first floor and a massive, winding staircase.\n\n\u201cWe sort of fell in love with it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the rest was history.\u201d\n\nBoth the National Trust and Cliveden\u2019s board felt Upsala\u2019s best shot for long-term stewardship and preservation was as a private residence, with a preservation easement, Malone-France said. Although some of the other offers also proposed turning Upsala back into a home, others suggested options including a law office, nonprofit school, and a hybrid private home with gallery space and retail space, Malone-France said. Ultimately, Aberle and Levy prevailed.\n\nTed Reed, executive director of Cliveden\u2019s board of directors, said he wasn\u2019t surprised that the buyers were a young couple, given recent residential renewal in Mount Airy and Germantown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a similar group of people who are buying houses, rehabbing them and restoring them,\u201d Reed said.\n\nMalone-France said she found the response \u201cheartening and inspiring,\u201d but adds she was particularly excited that the offer that rose to the top came from a preservation-savvy duo who understood preservation easements and had a well-thought-out plan for ushering Upsala into a new era.\n\n\u201cThese folks \u2014 Violette and Alex \u2014 we could not ask for better stewards of this property,\u201d Malone-France said. \u201cAnd the fact that they are doing so in such a 21st-century way is even more delightful.\u201d\n\nThe couple moved to the 6,724-square foot home from a 300-square foot apartment in South Philadelphia. Their four rescue cats, Marcel, Nemo, Will and Grace, enjoy following the sun from window to window each day.\n\n\n\nThe main library inside Upsala. The couple has added eclectic furnishings and new paint colors to the historical home. (Max Burkhalter for The Washington Post)\n\nTheir first task after moving in, according to the self-described \u201cclean freaks\u201d was deep-cleaning the entire house. The house had been well-maintained but needed a good wash. They decided not to use any harsh chemicals, instead wiping down every surface, including the floors, with a mixture of water and vinegar. It was a big job because of all the woodwork in the house.\n\nAfter installing central air conditioning on part of the second floor where the master bedroom is, they began painting each room themselves. The interior was largely pale yellow but now includes hues such as Turkish Tile, Roycroft Pewter and Mauve Finery by Sherwin-Williams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun,\u201d Aberle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become pros. The running joke is we can paint a whole room from prep to finish in a weekend.\u201d\n\nEclectic furnishings such as velvet sofas share space with a funky collection of vintage typewriters, juxtaposed next to elaborate 18th-century mantels. Modern art by artists John Holcomb of Topeka, Kan.; Mac Worthington of Columbus, Ohio; and Gunnar Montana of Philadelphia adorn the spaces.\n\n\u201cEach room kind of takes on a life of its own,\u201d Aberle said.\n\nThe house now includes a funky collection of vintage typewriters.

(Max Burkhalter for The Washington Post)\n\nThe couple was pleasantly surprised to learn the dining room\u2019s wallpaper is the lush scene \u201cEl Dorado\u201d by French wallpaper company Zuber & Cie. Hanging art was a challenge because the home\u2019s exterior is stone \u2014 technically \u201cWissahickon schist\u201d \u2014 and interior walls are brick covered with plaster, Aberle said.\n\nUpstairs, a two-stall bathroom pays homage to Upsala\u2019s days as a house museum, while the unfinished third floor has blackened remains from the 1940s fire set by vandals.\n\nThe kitchen, located in the home\u2019s rear wing, got \u201ca little minor Home Depot reno \u2014 it was just a little facelift with new floors and a fresh coat of paint, but it made all the difference,\u201d Levy said.\n\n\n\nA bold blue bedroom in Upsala. (Max Burkhalter for The Washington Post)\n\nThere are definite quirks. A stairway off the kitchen goes nowhere. A second-floor bathroom can be accessed by a rear stairwell but not from the front side of the home, where the couples\u2019 bedroom is, without going down a ladder.\n\nShortly after moving in, the home\u2019s two hot water heaters had to be replaced and one of the two furnaces wouldn\u2019t fire up, but fortunately only needed a starter. And given the thick walls, WiFi reception is a challenge.\n\n\u201cWe ended up getting a mesh system with 11 hotspots,\u201d Aberle said.\n\nThe couple declined to say what they\u2019ve spent on renovations and repairs to date.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not cheap \u2014 it\u2019s a lot,\u201d Aberle said.\n\nSubstantial changes to the house can\u2019t be made without written approval from the National Trust. When the rear of a copper downspout on the front of the home split and a patch failed twice, the couple asked to replace the damaged segment with an identical copper pipe that was thicker and might last longer. The request was approved in less than 24 hours, Aberle said\n\nWould they ever take on a project like this again? \u201cThere\u2019s so much work to do here that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever have the opportunity to start this in another house,\u201d Aberle said.\n\n\n\nThe attic of Upsala. Substantial changes to the house can\u2019t be made without the National Trust's approval. (Max Burkhalter for The Washington Post)\n\nThe couple, who are not required to remain in the house for any length of time, launched the Instagram account ( @historicupsala ) shortly after moving in. A big reason? While the home hadn\u2019t been open as a house museum in more than a dozen years, \u201cwe were very conscious of the fact that what was once a public resource would now be private,\u201d Aberle said.\n\nThe account has more than 2,800 followers and Aberle said he and Levy work to share the home\u2019s transformation and their lives in a way that\u2019s \u201csafe and able to respect our privacy and our boundaries and everything.\u201d\n\nAt the request of the National Trust and subject to the couple\u2019s approval, people affiliated with educational organizations, professional architectural associations and historical societies may be permitted access to study the property, Mayes said.\n\nStrangers sometimes knock wanting a tour or message the couple on social media hoping for a look-see. Usually, they politely reply that they don\u2019t offer tours, but do welcome the community in other ways.\n\n\n\nThe owners had to agree to allow the annual Battle of Germantown reenactment to continue in the front yard. The couple invite friends to watch it from their upstairs rooms. (Violette Levy)\n\nAberle and Levy hosted an invite-only cocktail party earlier this year and raffle for the neighborhood. They loan their yard to organizers of the annual Mt. Airy Day neighborhood block party. In August, the couple held the first annual \u201cSide Hustle Street Fair +Picnic!,\u201d which drew about 100 vendors who promoted their alternative trades or side jobs on Upsala\u2019s front lawn.\n\nThey\u2019ve also come to embrace Halloween. Last year, they transformed Upsala into a reproduction of \u201cAlice In Wonderland,\u201d replete with a mushroom field, Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party and the Queen\u2019s croquet court. Aberle was Tweedle Dee and Levy was the Queen of Hearts.\n\n\u201cWe love doing Halloween because it\u2019s a chance for us to engage with the neighborhood,\u201d Aberle said. \u201cThe house sort of necessitates a grand gesture.\u201d\n\nAnd each year they invite friends to watch the reenactment of the Battle of Germantown from their upstairs rooms.\n\n\u201cOur first year in the house we had no idea what to expect so naturally, we threw a party,\u201d Aberle said of the spectacle, which draws thousands.\n\nLevy added: \u201cPeople think it\u2019s fun to have somewhere to go to have front-row seats to the reenactment.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith an \"Alice In Wonderland\" theme, the couple had fun with the Halloween decorations at the historical home. (Alex Aberle)\n\nA half-hour after the couple closed, the doorbell rang and the neighbor\u2019s young son delivered a homemade card. It read, \u201cWelcome to the neighborhood, we\u2019re so glad to have you!\u201d Two years after working to making this place their own, Levy said the experience has been rewarding for the couple \u2014 and the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe just keep hearing a lot of like, \u2018It\u2019s nice to see activity because there wasn\u2019t activity here for so long,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cPeople appreciate seeing lights on at night, seeing us out in the yard and just having someone in the space.\u201d", "description": "A couple has been making this Philadelphia home livable again \u2013 with guidance from the National Trust.", "authors": ["Pamela Babcock"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2RDHnulWeRXE8Su572t45VwRNlM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DSOYTSWWQUI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
