When everybody\u2014when the Democrats and his opponents and the media are clutching their pearls about some new outrage and they think \u2018Wow, this is the end now,\u2019 he just doubles down!\u201d\n\nNoting that Trump doesn\u2019t feel \u201cashamed or sorry\u201d for being outed that he was pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family, Baker said that this shows Trump feels he\u2019s on \u201cpretty solid ground on this topic.\u201d\n\n\u201cFar from this being an abuse of power, as the Democrats would say, to get a foreign government to investigate a domestic political opponent,\u201d Baker added. \u201cHe feels there is some suspicious, questionable stuff that Hunter Biden has done in his various roles around the world and he feels it is legitimate to ask foreign countries to investigate.\u201d\n\nMoments later, co-anchor Sandra Smith circled back to Trump\u2019s open request that China look into Biden, wondering how the Chinese president would feel about being under this kind of scrutiny amid an ongoing trade war with the United States.\n\nBaker, meanwhile, suggested that Trump could use this to offer China a carrot in their trade negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt adds an interesting a little bit of spice to the trade dispute,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe again for the president, it\u2019s a possible area of agreement between the U.S. and China.\u201d\n\nBaker concluded: \u201cHe is saying look, if there has been something nefarious going on, China lost out from it. We\u2019re anxious to help China investigate as China should want to. So it may, against the background of pretty tough trade negotiations and a deteriorating economic relationship between the U.S. and China without any question, maybe this offers a little sunshine.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWhen the Democrats and his opponents and the media are clutching their pearls about some new outrage and they think \u2018Wow, this is the end now,\u2019 he just doubles down!\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570124204/americas-newsroom_28_novfne"}
