No way to force them to act.\u201d\n\nIf McConnell did refuse to call a Senate trial, it would echo his unprecedented move to refuse a vote on President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016.\n\nWhile McConnell has stated his view that Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense, he has previously told NPR that \u201cif the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into a trial.\u201d\n\nSee: Senate \u2018has no choice\u2019 but to hold trial if House impeaches Trump, according to McConnell\n\nFor his part, Trump has maintained his innocence and ripped those pushing for his impeachment.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me,\u201d he wrote in a Saturday-morning tweetstorm. \u201cOh well, maybe next time!\u201d\n\nAnd while there is a broad expectation that Senate Republicans would exonerate Trump if a trial were held, a number have raised questions about his actions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously lots that\u2019s very troubling there,\u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.).\n\nOpinion: A few small cracks appear in Trump\u2019s solid Republican support\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted: \u201cIf the President asked or Pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out.\u201d\n\nThis report previously appeared at NYPost.com.\n\nRead on: Here\u2019s what will happen next in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump", "description": "Some Republicans are hoping Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will again play the role of Grim Reaper \u2014 and kill any vote or even debate on whether to...", "authors": ["Jon Levine"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GF415_mcconn_ZG_20180313182941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
