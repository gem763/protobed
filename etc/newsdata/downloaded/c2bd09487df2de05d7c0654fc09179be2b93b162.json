But it is also, according to scientists at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Poland, almost indistinguishable in its structure from a purely mathematical multifractal.\n\nThe academics put more than 100 works of world literature, by authors from Charles Dickens to Shakespeare, Alexandre Dumas, Thomas Mann, Umberto Eco and Samuel Beckett, through a detailed statistical analysis. Looking at sentence lengths and how they varied, they found that in an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of the studied texts, the correlations in variations of sentence length were governed by the dynamics of a cascade \u2013 meaning that their construction is a fractal: a mathematical object in which each fragment, when expanded, has a structure resembling the whole.\n\nFractals are used in science to model structures that contain re-occurring patterns, including snowflakes and galaxies.\n\n\u201cAll of the examined works showed self-similarity in terms of organisation of the lengths of sentences. Some were more expressive \u2013 here The Ambassadors by Henry James stood out \u2013 others to far less of an extreme, as in the case of the French 17th-century romance Artamene ou le Grand Cyrus. However, correlations were evident, and therefore these texts were the construction of a fractal,\u201d said Dr Pawe\u0142 O\u015bwi\u0119cimka from the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, one of the authors of the new paper Quantifying Origin and Character of Long-range Correlations in Narrative Texts.\n\nSome works, however, were more mathematically complex than others, with stream-of-consciousness narratives the most complex, comparable to multifractals, or fractals of fractals. Finnegans Wake, the scientists found, was the most complex of all.\n\nI am really one of the greatest engineers, if not the greatest, in the world James Joyce\n\n\u201cThe absolute record in terms of multifractality turned out to be Finnegans Wake by James Joyce. The results of our analysis of this text are virtually indistinguishable from ideal, purely mathematical multifractals,\u201d said Professor Stanis\u0142aw Dro\u017cd\u017c, another author of the paper, which has just been published in the computer science journal Information Sciences.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Multifractal analysis of Finnegan\u0092s Wake by James Joyce: the graph shape is virtually indistinguishable from the results for purely mathematical multifractals.

In a letter about the novel, Work in Progess as he then knew it, he told Harriet Weaver: \u201cI am really one of the greatest engineers, if not the greatest, in the world besides being a musicmaker, philosophist and heaps of other things. All the engines I know are wrong. Simplicity. I am making an engine with only one wheel. No spokes of course. The wheel is a perfect square. You see what I\u2019m driving at, don\u2019t you? I am awfully solemn about it, mind you, so you must not think it is a silly story about the mouse and the grapes. No, it\u2019s a wheel, I tell the world. And it\u2019s all square.\u201d\n\nThe academics write in their paper that: \u201cStudying characteristics of the sentence-length variability in a large corpus of world famous literary texts shows that an appealing and aesthetic optimum \u2026 involves self-similar, cascade-like alternations of various lengths of sentences.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn overwhelming majority of the studied texts simply obey such fractal attributes but especially spectacular in this respect are hypertext-like, \u2018stream-of-consciousness\u2019 novels. In addition, they appear to develop structures characteristic of irreducibly interwoven sets of fractals called multifractals.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sequences of sentence lengths (as measured by number of words) in four books, representative of various degrees of cascading character. Photograph: IFJ PAN\n\nThe other works most comparable to multifractals, the academics found, were A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers, Hopscotch by Julio Cortazar, The USA trilogy by John Dos Passos, The Waves by Virginia Woolf, 2666 by Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Joyce\u2019s Ulysses. Marcel Proust\u2019s \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu showed \u201clittle correlation\u201d to multifractality, however; nor did Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrugged.\n\nThe academics note that \u201cfractality of a literary text will in practice never be as perfect as in the world of mathematics\u201d, because a mathematical fractal can be magnified to infinite, while the number of sentences in a book are finite.\n\n\u201cIt is not entirely clear whether stream-of-consciousness writing actually reveals the deeper qualities of our consciousness, or rather the imagination of the writers. It is hardly surprising that ascribing a work to a particular genre is, for whatever reason, sometimes subjective,\u201d said Dro\u017cd\u017c, suggesting that the scientists\u2019 work \u201cmay someday help in a more objective assignment of books to one genre or another\u201d.\n\nDro\u017cd\u017c suggested today that the findings could also be used to posit that writers \u201cuncovered fractals and even multifractals in nature long before scientists\u201d. \u201cEvidently, they (like Joyce) had a kind of intuition, as it happens to great artists, that such a narrative mode best reflects \u2018how nature works\u2019 and they properly encoded this into their texts,\u201d he said. \u201cNature evolves through cascades and thus arranges fractally, and imprints of this we find in the sentence-length variability.\u201d\n\nEimear McBride, whose multiple award-winning debut novel A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing is written in a stream-of-consciousness style, said she wasn\u2019t taken aback by the results.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that works described as \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d appear to be the most fractal. By its nature, such writing is concerned not only with the usual load-bearing aspects of language \u2013 content, meaning, aesthetics, etc \u2013 but engages with language as the object in itself, using the re-forming of its rules to give the reader a more prismatic understanding of the subject at hand. Given the long-established connection between beauty and symmetry, finding works of literature fractally quantifiable seems perfectly reasonable.\u201d\n\nBut she added that she couldn\u2019t \u201chelp being somewhat disappointed by the idea that the main upshot of this research may be to make the assigning of genre more straightforward\u201d.\n\n\u201cSurely there are more interesting questions about the how and why of writers\u2019 brains arriving at these complex, but seemingly instinctive, fractals?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, given Professor Dro\u017cd\u017c\u2019s pretty inarguable contention that it remains unclear whether or not stream-of-consciousness writing does indeed reveal a deeper layer of consciousness, what distance this research may go to explain why some readers believe themselves to be experiencing exactly that while others have the opposite reaction?\u201d", "description": "Researchers at Poland\u2019s Institute of Nuclear Physics found complex \u2018fractal\u2019 patterning of sentences in literature, particularly in James Joyce\u2019s Finnegans Wake, which resemble \u2018ideal\u2019 maths seen in nature", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6de2f3d405988b083ae397c7bf1e6fed870e973/0_17_1993_1197/master/1993.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bc8ec5991a6a2392d885df84be78aa7e", "published_at": "2016-01-27"}
