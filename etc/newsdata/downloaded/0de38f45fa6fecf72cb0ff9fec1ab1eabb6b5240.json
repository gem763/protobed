A fifth person, also part of the administration team, was gravely injured. The investigation into the \u201cmurder and attempted murder of public agents\u201d in connections with a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d has been handed over to the anti-terrorist brigade.\n\nRicard said the attacker had arrived for work at the police headquarters at 8.58am on Thursday after taking the suburban train near his home in the north-west suburb of Gonesse. At 12.18pm he left the police complex on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9.\n\n\u201cHe went to a shop in the Rue Saint-Jacques and bought two knives. One was a metal kitchen knife 33cm long with a 20cm blade, the other was an oyster knife. Leaving the shop he took a detour and hid the knives he had bought on him,\u201d Ricard told a press conference. He said the attacker\u2019s behaviour during this time \u201cdisplayed no nervousness\u201d.\n\nAfter Micka\u00ebl H returned to his office, Ricard described how \u201cin circumstances to be established \u2026 he mortally wounded with his knife, two victims who were getting ready to go to lunch\u201d. He said that the first victim, a 50-year-old, suffered a large wound to the neck, a second, aged 38, was fatally stabbed several times around the thorax and abdomen.\n\n\u201cThe autopsies carried out after these deaths show that it was a scene of extreme violence,\u201d he added. \u201cThe attacker then went to another office on the same floor and stabbed a 37-year-old agent several times, two of them fatal. He then tried to go into another office, luckily closed, in which three police staff were having their lunch.\u201d\n\nThe attacker then took the stairs and stabbed a 39-year-old police officer, who died of their wounds. At the ground level he attacked a member of the administrative staff, leaving them with serious but non-fatal wounds to the neck.\n\nIn the prefecture courtyard, he was challenged by a trainee police officer who tried to reason with him telling him to drop his knife. He told police that the man ignored his appeals and ran at him with the knife, so he shot him twice. \u201cThe total length of this killing spree is estimated at seven minutes,\u201d Ricard said.\n\nRicard said Mikha\u00ebl H was 45 and had been born on the French island of Martinique, adding he had been left deaf after suffering with meningitis. He had converted to Islam several years ago, according to witnesses.\n\nHe joined the police in 2003, and worked as a computer expert with the surveillance department. He had no criminal record but appeared in court on charges of domestic violence in 2009. \u201cWe are now looking into motives and accomplices to this attack,\u201d Richard said.\n\nHe said Mikha\u00ebl H and his wife, 38, who is being questioned by police as a suspected accomplice, exchanged 33 SMS messages between 11.21am and 11.50am on Thursday. He said the subject matter of these messages were \u201cexclusively religious\u201d and ended with the words: \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and \u201cFollow our beloved prophet Mohamed and reflect on the Qur\u2019an\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese SMS, if not explicit about any possible attack, nevertheless were sent only 30 minutes before the knives were bought,\u201d Ricard said. He added the attacker was believed to have been in contact with others thought to belong to \u201ca Salafist movement\u201d.\n\nWitnesses have told police the attacker showed signs of radicalisation, notably expressing support for Islamist actions, his reluctance to have contact with women, justification of the 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and changing his dress several months ago from \u201cwestern clothing to that suitable for the mosque\u201d.\n\nRicard said the investigation had become one for anti-terrorist investigators because of \u201ca combination of elements \u2026 the premeditated character of the attack, his professed desire to die during the attack, the nature of the attacks and the injuries inflicted on at least one of the victims, the context of latent radicalisation and the exclusively religious message sent before the attack\u201d.", "description": "France\u2019s national anti-terrorist prosecutor said police now believe it was terrorist attack", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ca91572a2b024477aa2d5a63e1e23034e8f8d8c/0_51_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0343998d970093b5fcdbc6ef37a9f669", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
