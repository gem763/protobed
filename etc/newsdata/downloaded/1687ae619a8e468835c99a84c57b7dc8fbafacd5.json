The 28-year-old Brown lived in the same apartment complex as Officer Amber Guyger and Botham Jean when Guyger shot Jean to death in September 2018.\n\nBrown testified in Guyger\u2019s trial about the night that Jean was killed, saying he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived. He said he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots.\n\nGuyger was convicted Tuesday and sentenced the next day to 10 years in prison. Guyger, who was off duty but in uniform, had said she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own and thought he was an intruder. She was fired from the department soon after the shooting.\n\n'I want the best for you': Botham Jean's brother hugs Amber Guyger\n\nDallas ex-cop Amber Guyger convicted of murder in neighbor's shooting (Photo: AP)\n\nA Dallas police spokesman on Saturday would not confirm to The Associated Press that it was Brown who was shot Friday. He said the Dallas County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office would determine the identification Sunday.\n\nPolice said in a news release that they responded to the shooting shortly after 10:30 p.m. Friday. They said several witnesses flagged officers down when they arrived and directed them to an apartment parking lot where the man who was shot was lying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nThe man was taken to a hospital where he died.\n\nLee Merritt, a lawyer for the Jean family, said in a tweet Saturday that he spoke with Brown\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cShe is devastated. We all are,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cJoshua Brown was a key witness in the murder of Botham Jean that helped put Amber Guyger away. We need answers.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/05/amber-guyger-trial-witness-ex-dallas-officers-murder-trial-killed/3887160002/", "description": "The 28-year-old Joshua Brown testified in Amber Guyger\u2019s trial about the night that their neighbor Botham Jean was killed.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published P.M.
