Instead of searching for mimosas and eggs Benedict, make your way to Bistro Mornar (mornar means sailor) for a Rijeka-centric breakfast. Morning shoppers \u2014 with bags of vegetables, butcher cuts and seafood \u2014 stake out tables with red-and-white-checked cloths under a skiff hanging from a wood-beamed ceiling. Grab a sidewalk seat and start with mussels steamed in olive oil, parsley, wine, brandy and garlic. Order a liter of white Malvazija and opt for the lightly seared tuna steak with roasted carrots, potatoes and perfectly blanched kale. Brunch for two runs 400 kuna.\n\n12) 2 p.m. Eye on the prize\n\nTake bus number 32 (26 kuna) nine miles to Croatia\u2019s original resort town, Opatija. A getaway for 19th-century Austro-Hungarian royalty, the Opatija Riviera strings together opulence, beaches and traditional communities. Have a coffee on the terrace of Caff\u00e9 Wagner at Hotel Milenj, once a Hapsburg villa. Then walk the five-mile, seaside Franz Joseph I Promenade, colloquially known as Lungomare. Take in the rotating exhibitions of vintage postcards, posters and old photos at the Croatia Museum of Tourism before ending your stroll in the fishing village of Volosko. Along the way, Rijeka will be in full view on the opposite side of the bay. \u201cPeople here have absorbed a lot of cultures,\u201d said Vojko Obersnel, the mayor of Rijeka. \u201cBecause of that, we accept everyone and keep being ourselves.\u201d\n\nLodgings\n\nOriginally built in 1876, the Grand Hotel Bonavia is \u2014 at least until the Hilton is finished \u2014 the city\u2019s top-end choice. An anchor in the center just a block behind the main pedestrian promenade, Korzo, the four-star hotel has 120 rooms, multiple bars, two restaurants, a gym and a choice of saunas. A double room with breakfast starts at around 920 kuna.\n\nIf private lodging is your inclination, the Molo Longo has 180 apartments, rooms and villas all over the city and surroundings.
