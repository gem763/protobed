Images on TV and social media showed flames shooting up residential hillsides, fanned by winds of up to 50mph.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest evacuation that we\u2019ve had in Santa Clarita,\u201d Kathryn Barger, a county supervisor, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is being done to make sure that we protect not only life but property but also allow our firefighters and first responders to get up there to fight these fires.\u201d\n\nCalifornia wildfires: flames leave destruction across the state \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nMeanwhile, in northern California, the Kincade fire, which broke out late on Wednesday night, continued to ravage the wine-growing region of Sonoma county. The fire has so far destroyed nearly 50 structures and forced the evacuation of 2,000 people in and around Geyserville, a small town and popular tourist destination.\n\nAs of Friday evening, both fires were only 5% contained.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, declared a local emergency to assist with battling the blazes but firefighters face extremely challenging weather conditions \u2013 including strong winds, low humidity and temperatures of up to 90F (32C). A meteorologist described the statewide weather event as an \u201catmospheric hairdryer\u201d.\n\nThe governor made an appearance in the wine country town of Geyserville, where he visited a number of destroyed buildings. \u201cFamiliar sights to all of us, devastating sights to those impacted lives literally torn asunder,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nNearly 2 million residents headed into the weekend facing looming blackouts, after the utility Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) announced plans to shut off power to prevent further fires from sparking amid predictions for windy conditions. PG&E warned of outages that could hit people in the north and central parts of the state from Saturday until Monday.\n\n\u2018A wall of black smoke\u2019\n\nThe Tick fire has upended life in the suburban Santa Clarita Valley, about 40 miles (60km) north of downtown Los Angeles, which has been used as the backdrop for many movies and television productions and is home to the Magic Mountain amusement park.\n\nThe fire, which began in Tick Canyon, has spread \u201caggressively\u201d in the last 24 hours.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters extinguish a house set aflame by the Tick fire.

He spent hours trying to protect his home but was eventually forced to evacuate.\n\nClimate scientists had warned for several days before the wildfires broke out that this would be a week of especially intense fire weather across California. Smoke from the two fires is also disrupting life in two of the state\u2019s biggest cities.\n\nWinds were expected to pick up starting Saturday night, with speeds estimated to reach up to 80mph.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of event that makes me personally nervous, as somebody who has friends and family living in the fire zones in the [San Francisco] Bay Area, and I don\u2019t say that about all the events,\u201d Daniel Swain, climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we get lucky and there are no major ignitions. But if they happen, it\u2019s going to be really hairy Saturday night and Sunday. It\u2019s looking really, really extreme.\u201d\n\nA smokey haze drifting toward the Bay Area prompted warnings to residents to stay indoors, close windows and use masks. Los Angeles officials closed dozens of schools in the San Fernando Valley, just south of the blazes, because of fears over hazardous breathing conditions. Warnings that smoke could affect flights at San Francisco and San Jose international airports were also issued on Friday morning.\n\nFirefighters reckoned with other blazes outside of the Tick and Kincade fires. A brush fire near San Diego, dubbed the Miller fire, started around 1pm and had consumed 10 acres by late afternoon, menacing homes, sending plumes of smoke into the air, and prompting evacuations. The California department of forestry and fire protection\u2019s live fire tracking tool identified more than 10 active fires on Friday.\n\nAnd California wasn\u2019t suffering alone. Parts of Baja Calfornia, just across the border from San Diego in Mexico, are ablaze, fanned by the same wind event fueling fires in southern California. Mexico Daily News reported that in the last 48 hours, firefighters had responded to more than 100 fires in Tijuana alone, 19 of them forest fires, and three of them categorized as major.\n\nQuestions arise for major power company\n\nPG&E, California\u2019s largest utility company, is facing scrutiny over the origins of the Kincade fire. On Friday, PG&E admitted its electrical equipment might have ignited the blaze.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Kincade fire consumed homes in Geyserville, California. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nStrong winds earlier in the week had prompted PG&E to impose sweeping blackouts affecting a half-million people in northern and central California. Power was restored to most people by Thursday evening, PG&E said.\n\nHowever, PG&E said it hadn\u2019t turned off a 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville that malfunctioned minutes before the fire erupted. The utility reported finding a \u201cbroken jumper\u201d wire on a transmission tower Wednesday night.\n\nBill Johnson, the PG&E CEO, said it was too soon to know if the faulty equipment had sparked the fire. He said the tower had been inspected four times in the past two years and appeared to have been in excellent condition.\n\n'Be vigilant, be careful': Californians learn to live with constant threat of fire and power cuts Read more\n\nThe company, which filed for bankruptcy in January, is currently facing hundreds of lawsuits over its role in deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018.\n\nNewsom has pledged $75m to help communities prepare for future blackouts and wildfires, but he was pointed in his criticism of the power company.\n\n\u201cDecades of greed and mismanagement by PG&E have led us to this moment. Californians are infuriated \u2013 I am too. Years and years of greed, years and years of mismanagement, years and years of putting shareholders over people,\u201d he said in a series of tweets.\n\n\u2018This is life out here\u2019\n\nEvacuees at a Santa Clarita shelter waited on Friday for news about when they could return home \u2013 if indeed their homes have survived.\n\nFor some, fleeing wildfires has become an anxious routine. Brenda Taylor, 46, estimated that her family has had to evacuate eight or nine times in the last 20 years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mary Lewis, an evacuee from the Tick fire, sits on a cot at a shelter inside the West Ranch high school gym in Santa Clarita.

It looked like it was right there.\u201d\n\nShe said she had grown accustomed to fleeing fires, adding that she grabbed photos and her children\u2019s diplomas. \u201cI\u2019ve just gotten used to it. This is life out here.\u201d\n\nLarge wildfires require a cocktail of conditions, such as favorable wind speed and direction, fuel, terrain and a spark \u2013 and many agree the climate crisis is making those conditions more likely. Of the 20 largest wildfires in California\u2019s recorded history, 15 have occurred since 2000, at a time when forests have become drier and warmer.\n\nSince 1970, temperatures in the west have increased by about double the global average, lengthening the western wildfire season by several months and drying out large tracts of forests, making them more fire-prone.\n\nJeanne Weiss, 50, said she had \u201ceverything packed\u201d and was ready to leave along with her four cats, who are safe. And while it was her first time evacuating, she was concerned it wouldn\u2019t be her last. \u201cWith global warming, I do worry.\u201d\n\nMario Koran and agencies contributed reporting", "description": "Kincade fire in wine country has destroyed 50 structures while the southern California Tick fire has grown to 4,300 acres", "authors": ["Sam Levin", "Vivian Ho", "Susie Cagle", "Joanna Walters"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48e0b28ec7705b24a4f8917d5606586fafe3f4d/0_107_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8b54ffca3764ef81e902bdf5f6c65a2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
