REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is determined to do so despite parliament ordering him to seek a delay if he cannot negotiate an acceptable transition agreement before then.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies predicted borrowing would rise to 92 billion pounds - equivalent to 4% of national income - by 2021/22 under a \u201crelatively benign\u201d no-deal Brexit scenario, in which there are no major delays at borders.\n\nEven then, the economy would still enter recession in 2020, the IFS said in an annual assessment of the public finances.\n\nIf the government undertook enough fiscal stimulus to stop the economy contracting - roughly 23 billion pounds of extra spending in 2020 and 2021 - annual borrowing would peak at 102 billion pounds\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit would likely require a fiscal short-term stimulus followed by a swift return to austerity,\u201d IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said.\n\nIn the 2018/19 financial year Britain\u2019s budget deficit was 41 billion pounds or 1.9% of GDP, its lowest since 2001/02, following years of efforts to reduce the deficit from a peak of 10.2% during the depths of the financial crisis in 2009/10.\n\nIn the longer term, a no-deal Brexit would mean less money to spend on public services - or higher tax rates - than staying in the EU or leaving with a deal, the IFS said.\n\nEven without Brexit, Britain was likely to have to raise tax rates to fund the cost of pensions and public healthcare for an ageing population, it said.\n\nFinance minister Sajid Javid announced 13.4 billion pounds of extra spending on health, policing, schools and other areas last month - putting borrowing on course to overshoot a cap of 2% of GDP targeted by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for borrowing has worsened dramatically since March,\u201d Emmerson said.\n\nJavid is due to set out fresh borrowing plans an annual budget before the end of 2019, possibly before an early election as Johnson seeks to regain a working majority in parliament.\n\nThe IFS said the government\u2019s budget targets had lost credibility and it was now set to spend almost as much on day-to-day public services as planned by the opposition Labour Party before an election in 2017, promises which drew criticism from the ruling Conservative Party.\n\nIt also said the government should wait until the outlook for Brexit was clearer before setting long-term budget goals, and avoid income tax cuts of the type that Johnson suggested when he campaigned to become Conservative leader.", "description": "Britain's budget deficit is likely to more than double to around 100 billion pounds ($123 billion) if the country leaves the European Union without a deal, quickly requiring a return to austerity, a leading think-tank said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438232867&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961QT", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
