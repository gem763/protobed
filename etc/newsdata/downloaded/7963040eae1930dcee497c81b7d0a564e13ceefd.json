If you sign up, you\u2019ll get six months of Spotify Premium ad-free music streaming as a complimentary bonus along with the subscription.\n\nMicrosoft has been pretty tight with Spotify in recent years, replacing its defunct Groove Music app with Spotify as the default music player on Windows 10. For Xbox One players, the Spotify app lets you listen to music in the background of your games, so it\u2019s a good fit on console as well.\n\nThere are a few catches to keep in mind before you leap at this deal: it\u2019s only available for new Game Pass subscribers (not current or lapsing members), and to be eligible for the free six-month Spotify Premium trial, Spotify\u2019s legal terms for the promotion say that, unfortunately, you can\u2019t take part if you\u2019ve ever subscribed to Spotify\u2019s Premium service or have used a free trial before.\n\nIf you\u2019re part of the subset of people who are still eligible to take advantage of this promotion, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is a fantastic value that\u2019s made even better with free Spotify. It normally costs $14.99 per month, but you can pay $1 for a month or $2 for two months. Microsoft says that you\u2019ll receive a code to redeem your Spotify Premium trial no more than 10 days after you begin your subscription.", "description": "New subscribers to Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass can get a free six-month trial to Spotify Premium.
