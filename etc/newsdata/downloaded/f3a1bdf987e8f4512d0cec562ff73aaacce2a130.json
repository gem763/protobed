He\u2019s a world-class architect and acoustic designer whose built recording studios for everyone from Jimi Hendrix to Jay-Z.\n\nAs someone whose built more than 4,000 audio/video studios, he knows a thing or two about getting a project started, getting over the wall, and seeing a vision come to life.\n\nElectric Lady Studios.

He talks about the architects who\u2019ve inspired him \u2013 Frederick Keisler, Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Cobusier \u2013 with the reverence of a storyteller. But when it comes to his process, his tone is more analytical:\n\nYou can either wait for a lightning bolt \u2014 you can stand outside in the rain and try to attract one, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that \u2013 or you can nibble at it from the bottom. Good questions bring good answers, so you start asking questions and the answers will tell you what to do.\n\nHe told TNW he was working on a new project and had run up against a wall, one of those design problems you just have to think about until you figure it out. We asked him how he usually works through those pain points, he chuckled:\n\nI don\u2019t really think about anything else. I just figure it out. I get grumpy, everybody \u2013 especially my wife \u2013 knows. I get distracted. But I\u2019ll figure it out. I\u2019ll decide how I want the rooms to come together and it\u2019ll all click.\n\nStoryk\u2019s 73 years old, but it\u2019s obvious that passion keeps him young. He talks about owning homes in three different countries and working for legendary musicians with the same gravitas as playing softball or sketching designs by hand. He lives in the moment:\n\nTime goes by at exactly the right speed. I don\u2019t subscribe to this idea that time flies. I don\u2019t have things I regret \u2013 well, I\u2019ll tell you: last night during the 7th inning I did wish I was younger. But otherwise, I don\u2019t worry about that.\n\nCredit: Cheryl Fleming Photography New York University.

You just start asking questions, some of them will have answers. How loud are you going to be? How loud are your neighbors? Some of them won\u2019t, and that\u2019s fine. You answer those questions by answering the previous ones. The process remains the same. If you\u2019re a contractor building a 10,000 square foot building or you\u2019re a designer making a custom $10,000 piece of furniture, the process is still the same.\n\nNot everyone has a meticulous mind for the kind of details that an architect of Storyk\u2018s calibur has, but it\u2019s even rarer that such a detail-oriented mind has such creative device. We asked what it\u2019s like to mentally ride the line between STEM and art, but his only explanation was \u201cit\u2019s just what I do.\u201d Perhaps that explains why he has no plans of stopping anytime soon.\n\nCredit: Cheryl Fleming Photography Jungle City Studios.

That\u2019s the only answer. I love the piano, I play twenty minutes everyday. But what I do isn\u2019t really work to me. It\u2019s not something I want to stop doing, I enjoy it.\n\nNobody, not even John Storyk, can tell you how to design like John Storyk. But according to him: whether you\u2019re a novice or a master, the process is the same. You\u2019ll just have to come up with your own passion.\n\nRead next: Google data shows 2-factor authentication blocks 100% of automated bot hacks", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F05%2Fone.jpg&signature=a99ca86a36165a82c1a6f91800e76368", "published_at": "2019-05-23"}
