REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\n\u201cWe have learned and are still learning from these accidents, Mr. Chairman. We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong,\u201d Muilenburg will tell the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee.\n\nThe testimony, which was first reported by Reuters and made public later on Monday, added that the company had made improvements to the now-grounded MAX 737 airplane \u201cthat will ensure that accidents like these never happen again.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month, will also testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. airlines have canceled flights into January and February because of the grounding and the Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to approve the 737 MAX\u2019s ungrounding until December at the earliest.\n\n\u201cWe also know we can and must do better,\u201d Muilenburg\u2019s testimony says. It also expresses \u201cdeepest sympathies to the families and loved ones\u201d of those killed, noting the hearing would be taking place on the anniversary of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia that killed 189 people. He added that when the 737 MAX returns, \u201cit will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly.\u201d\n\nIn March, after a 737 MAX crash of Ethiopian Airlines 302 killed 157 people, the plane was grounded worldwide.\n\nSenate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker told Reuters last week that the 737 MAX \u201cwon\u2019t fly unless 99.9% of the American public and American policymakers are convinced that it\u2019s absolutely safe.\u201d\n\nIndonesian investigators reported on Friday that Boeing acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on its 737 MAX airliner, sowing the seeds for Lion Air 610 that also involved errors by airline workers and crew.\n\n\u2018LONGER THAN EXPECTED\u2019\n\nMuilenburg noted that both crashes involved the repeated activation of a flight control software function known as MCAS after it got faulty sensor input.\n\nBoeing\u2019s development of that software has come under criticism in reports and from lawmakers and the company is adding significant safeguards to the system. Muilenburg said the changes would \u201celiminate the possibility of even extremely unlikely risks that are unrelated to the accident.\u201d\n\nBoeing has admitted few mistakes since the two fatal crashes. Earlier this month, the FAA questioned why Boeing withheld instant messages from a former pilot for months that raised questions about MCAS.\n\nIn May, Boeing acknowledged it did not tell the FAA for 13 months that it inadvertently made an alarm alerting pilots to a mismatch of flight data optional on the 737 MAX, instead of standard as on earlier 737s. The company insisted the missing display represented no safety risk.\n\nMuilenburg acknowledged that getting the plane in the air \u201chas taken longer than we originally expected, but we\u2019re committed to getting it right, and return-to-service timing is completely dependent on answering each and every question from the FAA.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cregulators should approve the return of the MAX to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane\u2019s safety.\n\nThe flying public deserves nothing less.\u201d\n\nU.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House panel, has one main question for Boeing at Wednesday\u2019s hearing: \u201cHow the hell did this happen?\u201d", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will acknowledge on Tuesday that the aircraft manufacturer made mistakes, as he appears at a congressional hearing on two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people, according to written testimony made public on Monday.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445929437&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1FQ", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
