Moderates might have the \u201cgood will\u201d that leads them to acknowledge injustice, but their very moderation is indicative of a \u201cshallow understanding\u201d that is emptied of the pain of those who currently suffer. For these moderates, injustice is a foreign affair, an abstract problem to be solved. Their response then lacks the urgency that a true understanding would bring. Learning how to expand their moral universe \u2014 learning how to turn opponents into allies \u2014 is just as pressing a problem as ever.\n\nAlmost two centuries ago, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard addressed this very issue. In his work \u201cFear and Trembling,\u201d he went to great lengths to praise the biblical Abraham for his apparent willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac. And while Kierkegaard\u2019s praise of Abraham has led to no small number of misinterpretations, given how horrific it appears to be, Kierkegaard was not suggesting that we too should be willing to commit such an obviously terrible act. Instead, as Dr. King\u2019s \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d helps reveal, Kierkegaard used this story to demonstrate how, to those with a more limited moral imagination, actions which are deeply ethical can often appear as the greatest of crimes \u2014 as if we were willing to sacrifice that which is most dear.\n\nAs Kierkegaard understood, we typically make judgments from the point of view of the conventional ethics in which we are raised, but these ethics are always tied to the particular society we inhabit. And while Kierkegaard realized that our particular social ethics might contain a measure of truth, perhaps even a great deal of it, our adherence to them is often inauthentic. That is, we often act ethically because we have been socialized into a particular ethical worldview and not because we have any deeper underlying ethical commitments.\n\nThis means that there might be ethical actions that fall outside of our ethical horizon. But as we have each been raised to believe in the supremacy of our ethical reality \u2014 we each believe that our values are the true values \u2014 the mere suggestion that an ethical reality lies beyond our horizon threatens to undermine our worldview. So while it is easy to say that Abraham is a criminal, because this is a judgment that we can make from within our ethical worldview, it is harder to accept the possibility that he might not be \u2014 because that requires that we accept that our worldview might have limits. Consequently, even the smallest of such transgressions threatens the integrity of our world. And they tend to elicit the most ruthless of responses.\n\nSeveral years after writing \u201cFear and Trembling,\u201d Kierkegaard would write what is generally considered to be his \u201cmature\u201d ethics, in the aptly titled \u201cWorks of Love.\u201d Unlike the different forms of social ethics that depend on our conformity, for Kierkegaard, love is the deepest expression of our authentic self. And when we learn to love, what we love is this same self in others. When we act out of love, we are not motivated by a fidelity to a particular set of social values, but by an authentic bond that unites all individuals on the basis of our shared humanity.", "description": "A lack of moral imagination can make deeply ethical actions seem like crimes.", "authors": ["Jamie Aroosi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/opinion/30stone-aroosi-1/30stone-aroosi-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
