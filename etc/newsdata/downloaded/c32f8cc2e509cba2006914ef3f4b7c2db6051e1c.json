Supporters of no franchise in particular, but the sport as a whole, Leonie explained the uniquely enthusiastic and feel-good sense of camaraderie that attracted them to make the 447-mile trip.\n\n60,087 people went to see the NFL game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday\n\nThe London fans have been enjoying the spectacle the NFL is able to put on at the matches\n\nThe Carolina Panthers came out on top against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday\n\nAs if their devotion needed any certifying, they showed off photos of their wedding, and a cutting of an American-football themed cake \u2013 goalposts and all.\n\nThis Sunday, despite irritatingly persistent downpours, that level of commitment was no different before the Carolina Panthers faced the Tampa Bay Buccaneers \u2013 game two at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, the NFL know how to put on a show. Whilst you may attend a football match, or watch a game of cricket, at American Football you immerse yourself in a high-value entertainment spectacle, both before, during and after the action. It\u2019s practically non-negotiable.\n\nAnd not just for those attending. Pubs and shops in and around White Hart Lane certainly embrace it too. Situated a stone\u2019s throw from the stadium, the No 8 bar was packed to the rafters two hours before kick-off.\n\nFully-stocked with beers and cider, loud music, dimmed lights, video games \u2013 the No 8 had it all. Supporters of all ages from all backgrounds socialised in good harmony, keen to enjoy the occasion. Other local outlets prospered too.\n\nFan parties have been in full swing across the capital in the run up to the international games\n\nThe Nail Group, situated next to the stadium on Whitehall Street, opted to expand its usual offering as fans flocked to get their faces painted with Panthers and Buccaneers emblems. Convenience stores also benefited from those keen to consume cheap alcohol, as opposed to more expensive pints.\n\nA couple of days after alcohol-fuelled England supporters unexpectedly found themselves in trouble with local police in Prague, with 14 arrests, NFL supporters exemplified a perfect balance. Partisan, passionate, but by no means pig-ignorant.\n\nOnce through the turnstiles too, supporters are treated with entertainment both on and off the pitch. Booming music, an American narrator describing the much-needed detail after each play, and a host of sideline performances, from trampoliners to cheerleaders.\n\nGiant screens in each corner of the stadium offering immediate replays, amusing advertisements and examples of fan engagement; for example, two lucky fans received a platter of sandwiches courtesy of Subway, NFL UK\u2019s primary sponsor.\n\nWill the success of the London games over the past few years lead to even more in the future?\n\nThese controllable elements of the extravaganza, engrossing first-timers down to weekly watchers, were nailed to perfection.\n\nOn the pitch, the Buccaneers had beaten the Panthers in their own backyard in week two, but the fortunes were reversed on this occasion. Jameis Winston threw an interception with his first play of the game, and it set the tone for what was a lacklustre performance from the Bucs quarterback - he threw five interceptions in total.\n\nStar Carolina running-back Christian McCaffrey set the place alight with a trademark series of steps and jinks, leaving three Tampa Bay defenders in his wake for a second-quarter touchdown, and from that moment on, the Buccaneers never looked likely to recover what was a hefty deficit.\n\nIn the end, despite a valiant late Tampa Bay fightback, it finished 37-26 to Carolina. Ron Rivera\u2019s side stretch their record to 4-2 against their NFC South rivals, who are now 2-4.\n\nYet for organisers, much-like the usual soggy British weather, the competitiveness of the action is an uncontrollable. As it happens, these two games by London standards have been pretty good.\n\nBut what do the controllables tell us about any potential expanding of the relationship between the NFL and London?\n\nRight now, two games are held at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and two at Wembley\n\nWith the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium unquestionably passing its two-game curtain-raising audition, decision-makers both sides of the Atlantic can be left in no doubt - everything is in place.\n\nFour London games-a-season is no token gesture anymore. 12 years after its debut, London deserves these now, and are a common point of reference that most franchises have come to embrace midway through the regular season.\n\nAs opposed to those calling for an NFL franchise in London though, with obvious obstacles of scheduling, travel and no city currently prepared to sacrifice its NFL team, an increase of matches is the next logical step.\n\nThat way, we can see if Tottenham and its north London partner Wembley can cope with the increased regularity of games, as opposed to the present-day Autumn exhibition. Maybe even the added drama and significance of a play-off game isn\u2019t too far-fetched an idea also.\n\nWhat\u2019s vital though, is that with this fantastic new facility at Tottenham, all the components are there. Atmosphere? Check. Infrastructure? Check. But most crucially, a continental-wide appetite? Check. Irrespective of who you were rooting for, not one of the 60,087 fans in attendance here today went home feeling short-changed.\n\nRoll on game three at Wembley in two weeks time.", "description": "KIERAN JACKSON AT TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM: Last week, ahead of the first NFL game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, franchise fan parties were in full swing.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/18/19661958-0-image-a-12_1570988610780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
