USA TODAY\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. \u2013 Illinois deserved this moment.\n\nThirty-one point underdogs, the Illinois players celebrated on the field with several thousand of their fans from the announced crowd of 37,363 Saturday afternoon at Memorial Stadium.\n\nJames McCourt\u2019s 39-yard field goal as time expired gave the Illini a 24-23 victory over No. 6 Wisconsin and the right to linger on the field as long as they wanted.\n\nJust as surely, Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst and his players deserved to feel every bit of anger, disappointment or disbelief after losing for the first time this season.\n\nWisconsin players walk off the field as Illinois celebrates their 24-21 win at Memorial Stadium. (Photo: Holly Hart, AP)\n\nThe offense stalled in the red zone, twice settling for field goals after moving inside the 10, and suffered two critical turnovers in the final 7 minutes, 12 seconds.\n\nIllinois turned those turnovers \u2013 a fumble by Jonathan Taylor at the Illinois 19 after a 6-yard gain on second-and-3 and Jack Coan\u2019s third-down interception at the Illinois 47 with 2:32 left \u2013 into 10 points to rally for the victory. Overall, the Illini turned three turnovers into 17 points.\n\nThe Badgers defense made critical stops at times but also gave up too many big plays, thanks in part to gaping holes at the line of scrimmage and missed tackles in the secondary. That included a pass of 18 yards, a run of 22 yards and a 29-yard touchdown pass on the Illini\u2019s four-play, 75-yard drive after Taylor\u2019s fumble.\n\nSCARY SCENE: Oklahoma's Sooner Schooner crashes on field\n\nBAD MOVE: Clemson player ejected after throwing punch at Louisville player\n\nWisconsin\u2019s special teams again faltered, and for the first time this season that miscue contributed to a loss.\n\nCollin Larsh hit field goals of 24, 44 and 20 yards but his miss from 37 yards with 2:39 remaining in the third quarter left the Badgers' lead at 20-7.\n\n\u201cIts on me,\u201d said Larsh, who has made 6 of 10 field-goal attempts this season. \u201cI just mishit the ball, left it out right.\n\nTaylor, who became the fourth Bowl Subdivision player to reach the 5,000-yard rushing mark in his first three seasons, acknowledged those who watched the Badgers stumble Saturday likely came to the conclusion that perhaps this team is less formidable and more vulnerable than many thought after six victories.\n\n\u201cI think people will probably say that,\u201d said Taylor, who finished with 132 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries. \u201cEspecially because we weren\u2019t executing.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do a good job protecting the ball. The coaches do a good job all week of game-planning and scheming all week and they cut us loose on Saturdays. We\u2019ve got to do a (better) job of making those plays come to life.\u201d\n\nThe loss dropped Wisconsin (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten) one game behind Minnesota (7-0, 4-0) in the Big Ten West Division, with the Gophers playing Saturday at Rutgers.\n\nIt also removed much of the luster ahead of the Badgers traveling to No. 4 Ohio State (7-0, 4-0), which less than 24 hours earlier remained unbeaten by decimating Northwestern.\n\n\u201cIt definitely sucks,\u201d tight end Jake Ferguson said. \u201cPut it behind us and it is all about prep for next week.\u201d\n\nThe players will begin preparing Sunday to face an Ohio State that appears more talented across the board than Wisconsin.\n\nBut first, they\u2019ll re-examine all that went wrong against an Illinois (3-4, 1-3), a team that surrendered 34 points to Eastern Michigan, 42 to Nebraska 40 to Minnesota and 42 to Michigan during a four-game losing streak.\n\nThey\u2019ll wonder why they settled for a 24-yard field goal by Larsh for a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter after moving to first and goal at the 7. Taylor rushed for 1 yard on first down; Coan threw incomplete to Quintez Cephus on second down; and Taylor was stuffed for no gain on third down.\n\nThey\u2019ll wonder why they settled for a 20-yard field goal by Larsh and a 23-14 lead with 9:46 remaining in the game after moving to first and goal at the 3. Taylor gained 1 yard on first down; fullback John Chenal gained 1 yard on second down; and Chenal got the ball again on third down and this time lost a yard.\n\nThe decision to give the ball to Chenal rather than Taylor on third down was dubious but the blocking all three runs wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cYou win ball games by getting the ball in the end zone,\u201d said senior guard David Moorman, who got extensive playing time with Jason Erdmann hampered by an unspecified injury.\n\nLogan Bruss, who played right tackle and right guard, Saturday, agreed. Wisconsin moved the ball well at times and finished with 420 yards but championship finish drives with touchdowns, not field goals.\n\n\u201cI think we moved the ball pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t make the plays when we needed to make them.\u201d\n\nThe Badgers entered the day with four shutouts on their record, having allowed a total of four touchdowns and 29 points in six games (342 plays).\n\nThe Illini generated three touchdowns and a field goal in just 56 plays. They burned Wisconsin\u2019s defense with a 48-yard touchdown pass from Brandon Peters to Donny Navarro to pull within 10-7. Reggie Corbin ripped off 43-yard touchdown run through the middle of the defense made the score 20-14 in the final minute of the third quarter. And Peters hit Josh Imatorbhebhe for a 29-yard touchdown to cap the 75-yard drive after Taylor\u2019s fumble.\n\nLinebacker Jake Hansen, who entered the day with five forced fumbles, had the hit that forced Taylor to fumble.\n\nHe walked into the Illinois interview room puffing on a cigar.\n\n\u201cThirty-one point underdogs, huh?\u201d he asked to anyone willing to listen. \u201cIt\u2019 a big (expletive) you.\u201d\n\nWisconsin's coaches and players had no recourse to let the Illini celebrate Saturday. The Illini earned this victory. The Badgers earned this stunning defeat.\n\n\"I don't think we played very well,\" senior outside linebacker Zack Baun said. \"I feel like we didn't have the fire we had in previous games going in.\n\n\"It's not like we weren't prepared. It's not like we didn't know what they were going to run. They ran all the stuff we expected. ...\n\n\"We've got to do a better job in the second half. They stuck around and took advantage of opportunities and just made more plays than we did.\"", "description": "Wisconsin players have no excuses after poor play against Illinois cost the team their unbeaten record and damaged their College Football Playoff bid.", "authors": ["Jeff Potrykus", "Published P.M.
