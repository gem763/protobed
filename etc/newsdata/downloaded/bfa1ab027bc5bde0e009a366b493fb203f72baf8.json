This avoids other people arriving and taking the seats prior to those in the queue.\n\n\"Our system works extremely efficiently and customers rarely have to wait for a table as they are directed to a table once they have their food.\n\n\"Either way I hope your enjoyed your meal elsewhere.\"\n\nThe Elm Tree often respond to reviews on the site, even the good ones - which they mostly are, and like to interact with customers it seems.\n\nThey have over 300 excellent reviews and have an impressive 4.0 review out of 5 - they are definitely worth checking out, despite what this reviewer thinks.", "description": "Roy O'Connell, who runs The Elm Tree in Cork, Ireland, was having none of it when the one-star review was posted", "authors": ["Cormac O'Shea"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645822.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Elm-Tree.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
