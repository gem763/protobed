Among the questions he raised was whether the utility is too large, with a service area covering more than 40 counties.\n\nHe also faulted PG&E for putting what he called \"greed\" ahead of investments in its infrastructure to protect the electrical grid from dangerous winds.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.\n\nPG&E Chief Executive Bill Johnson acknowledged that his company had left \"millions of people\" without a \"fundamental service\" they expect and deserve.\n\n\"This is not how we want to serve you,\" he told a media briefing in San Francisco, adding that PG&E \"was not adequately prepared\" for such a large power outage.\n\n\n\n\n\n'THIRD WORLD COUNTRY'\n\nAs high winds moved south, a similar cutoff was under way by neighboring utility Southern California Edison, which warned that more than 173,000 customers could lose power in parts of eight counties, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura.\n\nResidents, business owners and even public officials expressed frustration about the blackouts, which the utility began on a much smaller scale last year during times of high fire risk.\n\n\"Northern California is not a Third World country,\" the San Jose Mercury Statesman said in an editorial. \"It's unacceptable that the region is being forced to endure this level of disruption as the long-term strategy for dealing with the threat of wildfires.\"\n\nPG&E, California's biggest investor-owned utility, said it had restored power to 126,000 customers by Thursday morning but a further phase of cuts was expected to hit 4,000 more.\n\nPower will be restored to areas once up to 77 mph (124 kph) winds die down and 2,500 miles (4,025 km) of transmission lines could be inspected.\n\n\"We faced a choice between hardship or safety, and we chose safety,\" Michael Lewis, PG&E's senior vice president of electric operations, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the hot gusty winds that usually hit northern California in October, sometimes called the \"Diablo Winds\", will continue into Friday morning.\n\nMuch of northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remains under a state \"red flag\" fire alert, although no major blazes have been reported.\n\n\"As soon as the weather passes, PG&E will begin safety inspections with 6,300 field personnel and 45 helicopters standing at the ready once we get the all clear,\" the utility said in a tweet on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nECONOMIC COST\n\nOakland supermarkets brought in refrigeration trucks to save food and Montclair businesses like Laurie Shepherd's dental clinic were unable to tell patients when they would reopen.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said Shepherd by phone, after she tore a tendon rushing to prepare for the outages. \"We were just left up in the air.\"\n\nMichael Wara of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment estimated the economic cost of the shutdown could reach $2.5 billion, with small businesses hit hardest as they typically lacked back-up generators.", "description": "California Governor Gavin Newsom called a widespread electricity shutdown triggered by a power company to prevent wildfires \"unacceptable,\" saying on Thursday it resulted from years of mismanagement by the utility.
