This week, the Fed cut interest rates for a second time this year as expected.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell described U.S. prospects as \"favourable\" and the rate move as \"insurance.\" He did not rule out future cuts, but his remarks were not as dovish as markets had hoped for.\n\nThe AUD/USD pair rose 0.1% to 0.6794, but the NZD/USD pair slipped 0.2% to 0.6289.\n\nThe USD/JPY pair was down 0.1% to 107.90.\n\nThe USD/CNY pair slipped 0.1% to 7.0866.", "description": "Forex - Pound Rises on Brexit Hope; U.S. Dollar Little Changed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF1H0CT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
