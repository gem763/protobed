He's a director but not listed as a beneficiary of two other entities that added 125 shares each.\n\nAs for Broadbent, she took up $15,000 worth of shares in her own name, and another $15,000 through a company called Queens Park. Of which, her 3Y notice states, she is both a beneficiary and a trustee.\n\nA Macquarie spokesperson said the bank was \"comfortable that both the disclosures and the allocations are correct and in accordance with section 4.6 of the SPP terms\".", "description": "Macquarie directors Jillian Broadbent and Philip Coffee benefited twice from its recent capital-raise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.2156%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_423/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2592770879fb1da73a2f389c55106ea1b880acc3", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
