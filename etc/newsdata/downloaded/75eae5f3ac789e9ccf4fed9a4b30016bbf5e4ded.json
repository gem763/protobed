It is important to take action that can help save your lives.\u201d\n\nAt least one landslide was already confirmed, engulfing three homes in Sagamihara, southwest of Tokyo, where an elderly man was rescued.\n\nHagibis is forecast to be the first storm rated \u201cvery strong\u201d to hit the main island of Honshu since 1991, when the category system was introduced, a JMA official said.\n\nBy early afternoon, 3.25 million people were under non-mandatory evacuation orders, and more than 13,500 people had moved to shelters, including some whose homes were damaged by a powerful typhoon that hit the region last month.\n\n\u201cI evacuated because my roof was ripped off by the other typhoon and rain came in. I\u2019m so worried about my house,\u201d a 93-year-old man told national broadcaster NHK as he sheltered at a centre in Tateyama in Chiba east of Tokyo.\n\n\u2013 Power outages \u2013\n\nHours before the storm neared land, its outer bands brought tornado-like gusts of wind to Chiba, east of Tokyo, where one home was destroyed and several damaged.\n\nFive people including a three-year-old boy were sent to hospital, but none suffered serious injuries, the local fire department told AFP.\n\nIn Gotemba, west of Tokyo, the fire department said it had rescued one man who fell into a swollen canal but was still searching for a second man.\n\nThe JMA has forecast half a metre of rain for the Tokyo area in the 24 hours to midday on Sunday, with more for the central Tokai region, but many rivers were already close to breaching their banks by Saturday afternoon.\n\nThousands of homes in Tokyo and the surrounding areas lost power, though in some cases only briefly, with crews working to reconnect people as quickly as possible.\n\nAutomakers, including Toyota and Honda, have shut down their factories, and many supermarkets and convenience stores in the capital have closed, a day after residents shopping for typhoon supplies emptied the shelves.\n\n\u2013 Rugby, F1 disrupted \u2013\n\nThe storm has forced the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers scheduled for Saturday and the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches: England-France and New Zealand-Italy.\n\nIt could also jeopardise a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday. Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that game until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links.\n\nScotland face elimination if the match is axed and have warned they could take legal action if the game is cancelled. World Rugby called the threat \u201cdisappointing\u201d.\n\nJapan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.\n\nHagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after Typhoon Faxai hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Powerful Typhoon Hagibis roared towards Japan\u2019s coast on Saturday, killing one person and bringing \u201cunprecedented\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/2acd57_hours-worst-storm-arrived-its-outer-bands-killed-man-in-chiba-east-tokyo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
