The intelligence, concerning ISIS in Syria, had been provided by Israel.\n\nThe disclosure to the Russians by the President, though not about the Russian spy specifically, prompted intelligence officials to renew earlier discussions about the potential risk of exposure, according to the source directly involved in the matter.\n\nAt the time, then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo told other senior Trump administration officials that too much information was coming out regarding the covert source, known as an asset. An extraction, or \u201cexfiltration\u201d as such an operation is referred to by intelligence officials, is an extraordinary remedy when US intelligence believes an asset is in immediate danger.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Russia-Us-Spy-Extracted Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
