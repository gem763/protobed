The rojiblanco winger immediately saw all three of Madrid\u2019s central midfielders facing him, blocking down any options, with none having taken a risk to get forward when their team attacked. The counter soon fizzled out. And the game did too.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Simeone also sprung a slight surprise by starting winger Vitolo in a narrow attacking role, meaning lots of bodies in central areas throughout.\n\nThe result was a disjointed first half in which both teams had spells when they dominated possession and pinned their opponents back, but neither goalkeeper had a serious save to make. The second period was not that different, although Madrid did have a couple of good chances. Gareth Bale leaned back and curled too high when the ball ran invitingly to him 15 yards out, and Karim Benzema\u2019s header drew a fine save from Oblak.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Neither made much of an impression, and both were substituted before the end. England international Kieran Trippier dealt well with Hazard while also often getting forward dangerously, while Joao Felix was flattened early by Madrid captain Sergio Ramos and unable to influence proceedings afterwards.\n\n\u201cThe athletes eat the artists,\u201d was a succinct summation in local paper AS on Sunday morning.\n\nThe goalless draw should not have been a huge surprise, as this is the third straight La Liga season in which a derbi has finished 0-0. Not losing to Atletico has become an important matter of pride at the Bernabeu following a number of embarrassing results over recent years. While for Simeone a point against Madrid [or Barcelona] always seems to be enough.\n\n\u201cNeither us nor them took risks,\u201d Oblak said bluntly on Movistar TV afterwards. \u201cWe were careful, nobody wanted to lose. The draw is a fair result. We didn\u2019t play at our best, but when that happens you have to keep a clear head. La Liga is very long.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the post-game news conference Zidane confirmed that for him the most important thing on the night had been to stay solid and not concede chances.\n\n\u201cWe deserved more than one point,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cBut I must congratulate the players, we showed solidarity again, keeping another clean sheet. That is what wins you leagues. Above all we needed to be solid. We did not give up even one chance. And that is important. We lacked something more in attack, but we will improve in that. We must be happy as we are top, picking up points, playing well.\u201d\n\nSimeone claimed soon afterwards not to have been content with just a point at home to the neighbours, but his general demeanour suggested otherwise. The Argentine even threw in a veiled barb at Zidane\u2019s tactics - claiming his team had gone out to play passing football, while their wealthier neighbours just came to defend and counter-attack.\n\n\u201cThey looked to strengthen their midfield, with Valverde in, not James or Modric,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cAnd then to play on counter with Hazard, Bale, Benzema. With Diego Costa, Joao and Vitolo we were looking to play between the lines. But both teams came up a bit short in what they were trying to do.\u201d\n\nSimeone was being just slightly disingenuous. Zidane did put on Modric and new centre-forward Luka Jovic in the second half, while El Cholo\u2019s substitutions were more defensive. The home Wanda fans even whistled the replacement of Joao Felix with holding midfielder Marcos Llorente.\n\nBut the general point that neither coach\u2019s plan came off fully was correct. Simeone\u2019s latest attempt to evolve Atletico\u2019s style of play and make them less direct is not really working so far. Their seven goals in seven La Liga games this season is the lowest of his time in charge. Costa never looked a threat on Saturday evening, with Atletico\u2019s most influential player being holding midfielder Thomas Partey.\n\nMadrid have also reacted to the horrorshow of their 0-3 Champions League group opener at Paris Saint Germain by prioritising defence. Since then they have kept three consecutive clean sheets for the first time in either of Zidane\u2019s spells as coach. They passed 400 minutes of action without even allowing a shot on target - until Costa\u2019s late header was easily saved by his former teammate Thibaut Courtois. But neither have they been creating too much at the other end despite all their big name attackers.\n\nAS spoke on Sunday of the \u2018Zidane\u2019s Cholinizacion' - pointing out the former galactico appears to be following Simeone\u2019s playbook in getting his team to eke out results the hard way. Seven points from their last three games have been achieved by scoring just three goals. Even Madrid\u2019s talented galacticos like Bale and James Rodriguez have been showing their commitment to the cause with hard work off the ball.\n\nWhile both Zidane and Simeone might therefore have been happy with the result going home on Saturday, there is also a feeling that their teams have been unable to take advantage of the absence of the La Liga\u2019s most decisive player. Lionel Messi was again missing injured as Barca beat Getafe 2-0 elsewhere in the Spanish capital earlier on Saturday afternoon, with the goals coming from Luis Suarez and Junior Firpo.\n\nErnesto Valverde\u2019s team were outplayed before Barca goalkeeper Marc Andre Ter Stegen\u2019s superb assist for Suarez\u2019s opener, but grew in confidence from there and controlled the game despite going down to 10 men late on when Clement Lenglet saw a second yellow.\n\n\u201cWe needed to win,\u201d said Valverde after his team\u2019s first away victory since April. \u201cIt was a tough game, but we were solid from the start. If you want to win La Liga you must win games away from home. This will help bring some calm. Today was a difficult test for us.\u201d\n\nThere is a feeling that each of the three title rivals have yet to really get going, and also that their general quality levels have all dipped. It looks very significant that Barca are just two points behind leaders Madrid, and one off Atletico, with Messi only having played 91 minutes across the first seven fixtures.\n\nStill neither Atletico nor Madrid really went for the breakthrough on Saturday evening to try and take control of the title race. Soon after the final whistle AC/DC\u2019s 'You Shook Me All Night Long' was playing over the Wanda loudspeakers - and there was a feeling leaving the stadium that both teams could have kept playing till Sunday morning without either scoring.", "description": "Both Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane and Atletico Madrid\u2019s Diego Simeone got what they wanted out of Saturday\u2019s La Liga 'derbi' - but the real winners in the Spanish capital this weekend were a Barcelona team who made up important ground in the title race.", "authors": ["Dermot Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/10/real-atletico-tactics.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
