Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, per Vox.\n\nThis might sound like paid political content has free reign on his platforms, which include Facebook subsidiary Instagram, but Zuckerberg apparently does draw the line somewhere: public health campaigns for queer communities of color. Apicha Community Health Center\u2014a primary care center in New York City that offers a variety of medical services to underserved communities like Asians and Pacific Islanders (API), LGBTQ people, and individuals living with and affected by HIV/AIDS\u2014attempted to run an ad campaign on Instagram promoting public awareness about PrEP, a drug that significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission, among API men who have sex with men, only to have it rejected on the grounds that the center \"hadn't been authorized to run ads about social issues, elections or politics.\"\n\n\u201cThey said the copy was the problem but were unable to tell us what part of the copy was too political,\u201d said Phillip Miner, Apicha's Director of Grants and Communications, in a phone interview with VICE on Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating to encounter these sort of road blocks.\"\n\nInstagram did not respond to VICE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nJust over a million people are living with HIV in the United States today, according to the CDC, and the annual number of new cases in the U.S. has remained relatively stable since 2012\u2014the same year that the FDA approved Truvada for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV by 99 percent.\n\nIn New York City, the annual number of new cases has dropped by almost 31 percent in that same timeframe. This holds true when broken down by race and ethnicity, with fewer Black, white, and Latinx New Yorkers diagnosed with HIV annually since 2012, but the stats among API residents has stayed relatively the same, hovering between 100 and 150 new cases diagnosed every year.\n\nApicha CHC hoped to make a dent in those numbers by creating a public education campaign about PrEP that specifically targeted API men who have sex with men, using funding from the New York State Department of Health\u2019s AIDS Institute as part of the Institute\u2019s PrEP Aware initiative. The campaign, which is viewable on the @apichachc Instagram account, features artwork and interviews by queer API artists, who discuss stigma, representation, and their personal histories with taking PrEP. The center didn\u2019t have any problems when uploading the campaign posts to its feed or story, but Instagram rejected its attempt to create an ad campaign, which would have pushed the PrEP Aware content into the feeds and stories of people who don\u2019t follow @apichachc.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that a social media platform has rejected one of Apicha CHC\u2019s campaigns, Miner told VICE, though usually the company cites a supposed violation of its adult content policies\u2014the same restrictive policies that have pushed sex workers, artists, and influencers off of these platforms. Twitter initially rejected the center\u2019s PrEP Aware campaign for such reasons, though Apicha CHC was able to successfully appeal the rejection. \u201cUpon further review, we\u2019ve determined that the ad is in compliance [with our Adult Sexual Content policy] and have allowed it to run,\u201d a spokesperson for Twitter told VICE in an email.\n\nThat\u2019s how this process usually goes, according to Miner. Apicha CHC submits a campaign, and it gets rejected for being \u201ctoo sexual.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to talk about sex without talking about sex,\u201d Miner noted.) The center then appeals that rejection, and the campaign goes through. It has never had a campaign rejected on the grounds of it being political. Instagram did not clarify what exactly was too political about the PrEP campaign, which features queer API artists talking about their experiences with stigma and discrimination, but did offer a solution: If Apicha CHC could authorize every employee who uses the center\u2019s social media accounts through Facebook, they would be able to run the ad. This would not be possible, Miner told VICE, as one of his staffers, who wished to remain anonymous, uses a name on Facebook that does not match their government ID for undisclosed matters of personal privacy and security.\n\n\u201cSocial media platforms are the easiest way for us to reach [the communities we\u2019re trying to reach],\u201d Miner said. \u201cTo have social media platforms create these barriers when government entities have given us the resources to reach communities at risk is really hindering the national goal of ending the HIV epidemic.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter .", "description": "The campaign aimed to promote awareness among queer Asian and Pacific Islander communities in New York.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db3406434d426008d55fefd/lede/1572028517308-GettyImages-107091586.jpeg?crop=0.8907xw:0.7721xh;0.082xw,0.2114xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
