Trump hopes to run on by steep tax cuts passed in 2017, a hardline stance on immigration and an aggressive approach to China, as well as divisive rhetoric that appeals to some supporters.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade rolled into Baltimore, it passed one sign reading \u201cDump Trump, Ditch Mitch,\u201d referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. At least one sign favoring Trump in 2020 was seen.", "description": "Dozens of protesters gathered in downtown Baltimore on Thursday as President Donald Trump made his first visit to the city since he blasted it as \"disgusting\" and \"rodent-infested\" in hotly debated tweets in July.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429256783&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C03E", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
