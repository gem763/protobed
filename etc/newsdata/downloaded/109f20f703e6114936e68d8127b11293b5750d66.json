The England international also produced an accomplished display against league leaders Liverpool on Sunday afternoon.\n\nVan der Vaart isn\u2019t the biggest fan of United centre-back Maguire (Picture: Getty)\n\nDespite Maguire\u2019s promising start in United colours, Van der Vaart is yet to be won over by the centre-back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dutchman, speaking ahead of Sunday\u2019s clash at Old Trafford, slammed Maguire while comparing him with Liverpool\u2019s Virgil van Dijk.\n\n\u2018He can do something, but if he is worth so much money, Virgil van Dijk is worth \u00a3300million,\u2019 Van der Vaart told Ziggo Sport.\n\n\u2018If I am going to play with the amateurs on Sunday afternoon, I can easily find three who can do this. I mean that seriously.\n\n\u2018A bit silly to say, but I really think so.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Van der Vaart has taken aim at Maguire either. Back in August, he took aim at the England centre-back for his performances in the Nations League.\n\nVan der Vaart said: \u2018It\u2019s funny because during the Nations League, I was doing work for Dutch television.\n\n\u2018And I remember we were saying Harry Maguire was by far the worst player on the pitch.\n\n\u2018And then two months later, \u00a380-\u00a390m?
