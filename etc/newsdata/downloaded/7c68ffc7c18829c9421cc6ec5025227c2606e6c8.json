Can the story be that the president made no sense?\u201d she mused.\n\nNot only can it be \u2014 it should be. Watching an embattled Trump talk to reporters a day after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry was just the cherry on top of a wild media sundae being served the past couple of days.\n\n\u201cIt was a bombshell of a day,\u201d David Chalian, CNN\u2019s political director, said, and he wasn\u2019t wrong.\n\nStay tuned. There is a lot more to come. And it will challenge the media in ways we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nThere is no guarantee Trump will be impeached, of course, much less convicted and removed from office. But grab a seat in front of the television or computer screen while the process plays out, because news is breaking at an incredible pace, and the media are going to have to hang on for dear life just to keep up.\n\nHave-phone-will-tweet\n\nTrump being at the center of the story only complicates matters. He\u2019s a have-phone-will-tweet president even when he\u2019s not under fire. Separating what politicians say from the actual truth is often a necessary task for the people who cover them. In Trump\u2019s case, it\u2019s a duty magnified by an order of magnitude.\n\nBad for Trump, bad for national security: Ukraine investigation: Donald Trump's defense only makes him look worse\n\nHere\u2019s the pace of the way things are moving. Even as cable-news pundits batted around the fallout from Trump\u2019s press conference, pointing out inaccuracies and ramblings, they were showing Pelosi walking into a secure room to view a whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u2014 this on the afternoon of the morning when the White House released notes of Trump\u2019s call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which is what started the latest mess in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s like watching \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d on TikTok.\n\nTruly, it\u2019s just one thing after another. During Trump\u2019s media session at the U.N., he rambled, which isn\u2019t unusual, but he did so in an almost resigned kind of way, which is unusual. And while the networks covering the event didn\u2019t exactly fact-check in real time \u2014 well, most didn\u2019t; more on that momentarily \u2014 many folks on Twitter did.\n\nWhen it was over, CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer talked about the president serving up mischaracterizations and such, but could not bring himself to utter the \u201cL\u201d word.\n\nHis colleague Jeffrey Toobin had no such qualms.\n\nCalling Trump's lie a lie\n\n\u201cIt was 40 minutes, and it was a torrent of lies,\u201d Toobin said. \u201cJust a torrent of lies.\u201d\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Nicolle Wallace actually interrupted her network\u2019s live coverage of Trump, saying, \u201cThe president isn\u2019t telling the truth.\u201d\n\nA lesson in political patience: Nancy Pelosi's impeachment waiting game paid off. Americans will turn on Donald Trump.\n\nTrump was saying that former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, had been investigated by the Ukrainians already. (At the heart of all this is a phone call from Trump to Zelensky, in which he asks Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and, among other things, investigate Biden, a potential Trump challenger in next year\u2019s election.)\n\n\u201cNone other than the Wall Street Journal included in their report on Friday that the Ukrainians view this issue as having been investigated and adjudicated,\u201d Wallace told viewers. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is that what Trump appears to be trying to do is turn his own impeachment into a deflection.\u201d\n\nGood for her. Reporters need to do this kind of thing more often. Viewers deserve not only some context but the facts.\n\nYou hear this a lot because it\u2019s true: This isn\u2019t normal. None of it. Neither the actions nor the coverage of them, which requires new methods and tools.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be more important. This is history unfolding before us, and it\u2019s the job of the media to report and explain it fully and fairly \u2014 even if fairness means pointing out a lie. It\u2019s no time for false equivalency. It\u2019s time for the truth, as it happens. And it\u2019s happening at a breakneck pace.", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s possible impeachment will challenge the media in anything-but-normal times, as a bizarre Wednesday in the news showed.", "authors": ["Bill Goodykoontz", "Arizona Republic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2QU.MKSevvXybxtnVbllsQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_opinion_532/5e87f650de41afe6b8c8dca9a5802a53", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
