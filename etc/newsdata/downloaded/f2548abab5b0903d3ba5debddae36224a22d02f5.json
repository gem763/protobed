More than two million people RSVP\u2019d to the viral \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop All Of Us\u201d event on Facebook. About a thousand showed up in Rachel and Hiko, two small towns in Nevada that are both hosting music festivals, to either camp in reserved sites or snag a free spot on Bureau of Land Management land.\n\nSEE ALSO: A group of people ready to \u2018Storm Area 51' were met by armed guards at the gate\n\nA crowd did gather at the back gates in the middle of the night between Thursday evening and Friday morning, which was technically the morning of the 20th like the Facebook event planned. But there was some confusion among campers about when the storming was supposed to start, since so many people arrived on Friday. During the day, people trickled in and out of the 9.5 mile unmarked dirt road just off the highway, which leads to the only publicly accessible gate to Area 51.\n\nLed by YouTuber and professional slackliner \"Reckless\" Ben Schneider, Mashable joined a smaller group people as they tried to charge the gates again early Saturday morning. Some of them squeezed in the back of a U-Haul van \u2014 no, there weren't any seats \u2014 at 2 a.m. near the entrance of Alienstock in Rachel. After a bumpy drive, we wandered around the blockaded path until 3 a.m. when Schneider tried to rouse the crowd of less than a dozen into running.\n\n\"Let's all Naruto run in there,\" he shouted, brandishing his plunger like a sword. \"Remember, they can't catch us all!\"\n\nMatt Nyhus, an Alienstock attendee, managed to snag a video of it. Since he doesn't have an active Twitter account, he AirDropped the video to me and gave me permission to tweet it.\n\nI dragged myself out into the freezing cold desert at 3 a.m. to watch a guy with a plunger lead less than a dozen people into storming area 51\n\n\n\nbig thanks to my new friend matt nyhus for this video! we met at a tent of 20 year olds trading grilled cheese for alcohol & chairs! pic.twitter.com/KomBLmFi7k\n\n\n\n\u2014 morgan sung (@morgan_sung) September 21, 2019\n\nAnother stormer named Jasmine, who didn't know Schneider before Alienstock, described her harrowing experience riding in the U-Haul, which she called \"a rapist van.\"\n\n\"I met these random eight dudes who were running around telling me to get in a van with them, and I made the stupid decision to go with them,\" she said after the underwhelming Naruto run. \"I thought I was gonna die. He [an Australian tourist who was the designated driver] didn't know how to drive very well, so we kind of flew into each other a couple of times.\"\n\nReckless Ben and Jasmine sat in the back of a U-Haul van on the way to the Area 51 gate.
