Ninety-four people, or about 69 percent, have been hospitalized due to the outbreak.\n\nA hot tub display within the Davis Event Center at the fair, as well as a cooling fan outside of the center, were identified as possible sources of Legionella bacteria. In an Oct. 3 update, health officials said those sickened were more likely to say they walked by the hot tub display compared to those who were not sickened.\n\nIn its Friday report, North Carolina health officials said a water sample from the women\u2019s restroom within the Davis Event Center tested positive for Legionella pneumophila. However, the sample was \u201cgenetically different\u201d from clinical samples taken from those affected by the outbreak, they noted.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that environmental samples were not collected until between 12 and 22 days after the end of the Mountain State Fair and might not represent conditions during the fair,\u201d officials stated, adding that testing is ongoing.\n\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease is a severe form of pneumonia. People contract the disease when inhaling Legionella bacteria; it\u2019s not spread via person-to-person contact. Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium, is usually the cause of the illness, per the Mayo Clinic. It can be found in soil and water, but more commonly causes infection when it multiplies in water systems (e.g., hot tubs and air conditioners).\n\nLEGIONNAIRES\u2019 OUTBREAK IN NORTH CAROLINA LINKED TO HOT TUBS AT STATE FAIR, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nThe disease is treatable with antibiotics and those who are sickened typically recover in full. Symptoms often include fever, chills, cough and shortness of breath.\n\nThe news comes after health officials in Georgia responded to a massive Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak this past August, linked to a hotel in Atlanta. At the time, a state health official told Fox News that the Legionella outbreak was the largest ever recorded in the state.", "description": "Another person has died as a result of a Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak in North Carolina, state health officials announced late last week.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
