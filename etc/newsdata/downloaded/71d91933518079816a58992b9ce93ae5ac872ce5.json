Brian Stelter left off half of the NOAA forecast in his back-and-forth with Mollie Hemingway on Trump and Alabama \u2013 twitchy.com", "language": "en", "text": "We\u2019re at Day 7 on Sharpitegate with no end in sight. Here\u2019s the latest from Brian Stelter:\n\nDid the language used to cover President Trump\u2019s false tweets about Hurricane Dorian and Alabama end up helping him? @brianstelter digs into #Sharpiegate pic.twitter.com/omMS3BTbm9 \u2014 Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) September 8, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s mad at this meme the president tweeted showing CNN as a cat chasing a laser pointer:\n\nThe Federalist\u2019s Mollie Hemingway rightfully called Stelter\u2019s clip \u201ctedious\u201d (to say the least):\n\nThis video is tedious, but it's fascinating to watch. In response to Trump saying the media are his primary political opponent, CNN's @brianstelter says that the media must ramp up their politicized language and framing in opposition to him. https://t.co/xO5FjIozPD \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 8, 2019\n\nAnd that set Stelter off:\n\nIf stating the truth about Trump's Alabama claims leaves you thinking that a journalist sounds like an opponent, that's because his position opposes reality. Unless we've gone full Orwell, there's nothing political about stating the truth plainly and fully. \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) September 8, 2019\n\nBut Mollie fired right back:\n\nRedefining the media's absurd performances this week as \"stating the truth\" is preposterous. Even if you put the very worst construction possible on story, a hyperpartisan gloss as opposed to straight reporting, still wouldn't have merited 1-gazillionth the coverage or framing \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 9, 2019\n\nKeep in mind, this was all over a tiny flub that only one news station by our count even bothered to point out on Sunday. Granted, the president went scorched earth, but when will the media move on?\n\nThe problem is now the media obsession (well, and yours) has been so delusional and petty versus people's lives ruined or ended by the hurricane https://t.co/yljYUpJvuB \u2014 Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) September 8, 2019\n\nOh, and to justify his criticism of the president, Stelter presented this NOAA forecast from 11 a.m. on Sunday, September 1:\n\nThis was the forecast at the time of Trump's false claims. Everyone who looked at this map knew that Alabama was not at risk. It's as simple as this map. pic.twitter.com/BOoI9lg6zM \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) September 8, 2019\n\nAnd guess what he left out? That\u2019s right. He left out the 120-day wind speed projection that clearly showed a small risk to Alabama for tropical storm winds. If you zoom in, you\u2019ll see that Key West, FL is about the same risk as Alabama and Key West had its Labor Day holiday ruined because of the storm threat. Yes, it was small and yes the president misspoke on Sunday, but the risk to Alabama was never zero:\n\nHere are the latest Key Messages on Hurricane #Dorian. Storm surge and hurricane watches have been issued for portions of the Florida east coast.
