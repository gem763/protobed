REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nSeveral planes operated by Thomas Cook Scandinavian Airlines have not been able to take off because their leasing contracts remained with the British parent, Danish subsidiary Spies said.\n\n\u201cWhen you remove a subsidiary from its parent company as brutally as it happened Sunday night, there will be some loose ends afterwards,\u201d said Spies spokeswoman Lisbeth Nedergaard.\n\n\u201cRight now, one loose end is the leasing contracts of some of our planes. Some were leased through our parent company and subleased to us, others were the opposite.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the situation would be resolved.\n\n\u201cThe owners of the planes are right now looking into who\u2019s got what, and that is why some planes are on the ground until this is resolved,\u201d said Nedergaard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in dialogue with all parties involved as we speak and hope it will be resolved during the morning.\u201d\n\nAmong the disruptions, a flight from Palma de Mallorca to Helsinki was cancelled on Tuesday, according to Finnish airport operator Finavia, while a flight from Helsinki to Palma de Mallorca due to leave at 1740 local time eventually flew at 2347. A flight from Finland to Croatia was also cancelled early on Wednesday, just before boarding was about to begin.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s Nordic business said on Monday it would continue to operate as it is a separate legal entity from its parent, and it was looking for new owners.\n\nThe British parent\u2019s German arm, Condor, similarly remains in business. On Tuesday, the German government said it would guarantee a 380 million euro (\u00a3335.24 million) bridging loan to keep it flying.\n\nThe Nordic business consists of two legal entities, Thomas Cook Northern Europe and Thomas Cook Scandinavian Airlines, and is also known as Ving Group. The business operates under several brands: Ving in Norway, Spies in Denmark, Tjareborg in Finland, as well as Ving and Globetrotter in Sweden.\n\nTjareborg said in a statement that \u201coperations continue normally from Tuesday September 24 onwards. Business as usual\u201d.\n\nHundreds of thousands of holidaymakers were stranded by the collapse of London-based Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest travel firm.\n\nClose to 35,000 holidaymakers from the Nordics were travelling with the company at the time of the announcement.", "description": "Some flights operated by Thomas Cook's Nordic business have been cancelled or delayed as the subsidiary battles to survive the collapse of its parent company earlier this week.", "authors": ["Andreas Mortensen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433665300&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0FJ", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
