A statement from Rivlin\u2019s office indicated that he would pass the mandate to Netanyahu\u2019s main political rival, former Israel Defense Forces chief-of-staff Benny Gantz.\n\nNetanyahu was thwarted in his attempt to form a coalition in April by erstwhile ally and former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman, who refused to bring his party, Yisrael Beyteinu, into a right-wing coalition made of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud and smaller religious parties. Lieberman refused again during the past several weeks, demanding instead that Netanyahu and Gantz form a government together.\n\n\u201cOver the past few weeks I\u2019ve made every effort to bring Benny Gantz to the negotiating table,\u201d Netanyahu said in a video posted on his Facebook page. \u201cUnfortunately, he just simply refused time after time.\u201d\n\nGantz, who leads the Blue-and-White party, wrote on Twitter simply, \u201cThe time has come for Blue-and-White.\u201d (The statement rhymes in Hebrew.)\n\n2019 was the first year in Israel\u2019s history in which the country held two consecutive national elections. Since Netanyahu\u2019s December 2018 announcement that the country would go to elections, Israel has been ruled by what is essentially a caretaker government.\n\nIf no government is formed in the coming weeks, Israel will find itself in the midst of an unprecedented third national election within a year.\n\nThe rollout of President Trump\u2019s Israel-Palestinian peace plan has been delayed as a result of Israel\u2019s political deadlock.\n\nMeanwhile, Netanyahu faces an impending court decision on whether to indict him for corruption charges.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu has failed for the second time this year to form a government.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
