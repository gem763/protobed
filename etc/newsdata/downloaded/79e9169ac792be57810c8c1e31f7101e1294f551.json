With win No. 300, which includes postseason play, Belichick trails only Don Shula (347) and George Halas (324) on the NFL\u2019s all-time list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to coach this team and to coach the guys that I\u2019ve coached throughout my career,\u201d Belichick told reporters Sunday. \u201cFortunately I didn\u2019t play in those games. That\u2019s a good thing for us. But I\u2019ve had a lot of good players, a lot of great players, and they\u2019re the ones who win the games.\u201d\n\nBelichick\u2019s monumental win came against his former team in the Browns. He was 39 years old when he coached Cleveland to a win over the Patriots in 1991. It marked his first victory as an NFL head coach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to win,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to beat Cleveland. It\u2019s good to beat anybody. It\u2019s a tough league to win in. I\u2019m proud of what the guys did, proud of what the team accomplished today, but we\u2019ve got bigger goals ahead.\u201d\n\nRobert Kraft presents Bill Belichick with the game ball after his 300th win. pic.twitter.com/Wy3h9geOGo\u2014 New England Patriots (@Patriots) October 28, 2019\n\nPatriots running back Sony Michel had 74 rushing yards on 21 carries against the Browns.
