He\u2019s saying that he\u2019s furious at Jared because Jared is telling him he\u2019s going to get all these votes of all these felons.\u201d\u2026\n\nThe nub of the issue for Trump, say White House officials, congressional aides and friends of the president, who were granted anonymity to speak candidly on the matter, is that he no longer sees criminal justice reform as a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 booster heading into 2020. He brings it up at official events, in response to reporters, and to religious groups \u2014 and it was a key part of Trump\u2019s State of the Union address in January, when he welcomed home the first inmate to be released under the First Step Act \u2014 but it\u2019s far from a permanent fixture of his reelection campaign.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story Cid Apn"], "top_image": ""}
