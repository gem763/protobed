A second unsuccessful Ashes campaign as skipper. Getty Images 4/11 Jason Roy - 4 Swapped positions with Denly after a torrid time at opener, making 22 and 31. Still looks a long way from proving himself a Test batsman. PA 5/11 Ben Stokes - 4 A crash back to earth after his unforgettable outing at Headingley. Could not produce a third batting miracle of the summer and injured his right shoulder after an expensive stint with the ball. Getty Images 6/11 Jonny Bairstow - 4 Another disappointing return with the bat for a man whose tank might just be empty after a huge workload. Solid with the gloves. Action Images via Reuters 7/11 Jos Buttler - 7 Gave a good account of his battling qualities in each innings in what was easily his best game of the series. Needs a major score soon to silence doubts but this was a start.

His seamers were only a notch above functional but he dug down for nearly three hours in forlorn pursuit of a draw. AP 9/11 Jofra Archer - 4 Wicketless for the first time in his short Test career in the first innings and down on pace before his juices started flowing midway through the match. Still a huge talent but the quietest of his three outings to date. Action Images via Reuters 10/11 Stuart Broad - 7 Continued his playground bullying of David Warner, dismissing him twice for nought, and took his series wicket tally to 19 with five in the match. No blame attached here.

Action Images via Reuters\n\nA strong ninth wicket stand between Craig Overton and Jack Leach had briefly raised hopes of another stunning England escape, and Australia captain Tim Paine hailed his side\u2019s resilience.\n\nPaine said: \u201cI was really proud today with how our bowlers kept sticking at it.\n\n\u201cThis team\u2019s been through a lot in the last 12 to 18 months and I think the character we\u2019ve shown to bounce back \u2013 even from Headingley \u2013 shows a lot about the character of the people we\u2019ve got in our side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable series, it\u2019s been intense, every game\u2019s gone pretty much down to the wire and that\u2019s what we expected and prepared for.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s batting talisman Steve Smith said the victory would take the pressure off the final Test at The Oval, in which England can now do no better than level the series.\n\nSmith said: \u201cThere\u2019s another game left and we\u2019d love to win it but to know it\u2019s coming home is extremely satisfying.\n\n\u201cThe boys were getting a bit tight out there but with the new ball we thought we\u2019d get enough chances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here a few times when things haven\u2019t quite gone our way [so] to come back and get the urn here was always one to tick off my bucket list.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0captain Joe Root expressed his disappointment at losing the Ashes but hailed the character of his side in pushing Australia\u00a0to the wire.
