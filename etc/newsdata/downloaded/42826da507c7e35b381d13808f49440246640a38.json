England Jr. issued a written opinion saying the state law likely violates the U.S. Constitution. England Jr., who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, had announced last month he planned to block the law.\n\nTRUMP ATTORNEY JAY SEKULOW SAYS CALIFORNIA TRIED TO 'SHRED CONSTITUTION' AFTER COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF PRESIDENT\n\n\u201cCalifornia will appeal this ruling and we will continue to make our thorough, thoughtful argument for stronger financial disclosure requirements for presidential and gubernatorial candidates,\u201d Padilla said in a statement. \u201cOur elected leaders have a legal and moral obligation to be transparent with voters about potential conflicts of interest. This law is fundamental to preserving and protecting American democracy.\u201d\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, had signed the proposal into law in July. Jesse Melgar, the governor\u2019s spokeswoman, told the Los Angeles Times that Newsom supported an appeal of Tuesday's ruling, adding: \u201cStates have a legal and moral duty to restore public confidence in government and ensure leaders seeking the highest offices meet minimal standards.\u201d\n\nIn his 24-page decision, England Jr. said the law violates Trump's First Amendment right of associating with voters who share his political beliefs. He also noted the California Legislature is controlled by Democrats, who passed a law targeting a Republican president.\n\n\"The dangerous precedent set by this act, allowing the controlling party in any state's legislature to add substantive requirements as a precondition to qualifying for the state's presidential primary ballot, should concern all candidates alike,\" the judge wrote.\n\n\"The dangerous precedent set by this act, allowing the controlling party in any state's legislature to add substantive requirements as a precondition to qualifying for the state's presidential primary ballot, should concern all candidates alike.\" \u2014 U.S. District Judge Morrison C. England Jr.\n\nTrump attorney Jay Sekulow praised the ruling in an interview on \"Hannity,\" saying the law reflected \"an ongoing pattern and practice of trying to basically shred the Constitution.\" England Jr.\u2019s ruling affirmed that it was outside the state\u2019s authority to set qualifications for running for president. That power belongs to the Constitution.\n\nLawyers from state and national Republican parties, who are also defendants in the lawsuit, voiced concerns during last month\u2019s hearing that leaving Trump off the primary ballot would stifle Republican voter turnout at the primaries and, therefore, ensure that fewer GOP candidates make it to the general election.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nUnder California\u2019s so-called jungle primary system, all candidates, regardless of party, vie for the same elected office and the top two vote-getters move on to the general election. Since it was implemented in California in 2010, this system has often ensured a Democrat-vs.-Democrat general election battle in all but California\u2019s most conservative areas.\n\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson called the ruling a victory for voters and their ability to vote for the candidate of their choice. Patterson said in a news release: \"This decision rightfully stops the Democrats' petty politics and their efforts to disenfranchise millions of California voters and suppress Republican voter turnout.\"\n\nFox News' Andrew O\u2019Reilly and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "California\u2019s chief elections officer said\u00a0Tuesday he will appeal a federal judge\u2019s decision to block a state law that would have required President Trump to submit five years\u2019 worth of his personal income tax returns in order to be included on the state's\u00a02020 primary ballot in March.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace", "U.S. District Judge Morrison C.
