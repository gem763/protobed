REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThe Qataris have been unhappy for months with Paul Achleitner\u2019s stewardship of Germany\u2019s largest bank amid a prolonged stock slump. His failure to get Swiss banker Juerg Zeltner onto the supervisory board was a breaking point, according to six people, including top shareholders, bankers and others with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nRepresentatives of the Qatari royal family have told Deutsche management and other major investors that Achleitner, 63, should announce his departure soon, these people said.\n\nTwo Qatari entities, Paramount Services Holdings and Supreme Universal Holdings, which are each controlled by senior members of the nation\u2019s Al-Thani ruling family, have a combined stake of close to 10% in Deutsche Bank, one person familiar with the matter said, making them the bank\u2019s largest shareholder.\n\nOne person said that Achleitner should leave in the coming months, while a second said he should announce his exit by next year\u2019s annual general meeting in May at the latest.\n\nAchleitner, whose term ends in 2022, has assured colleagues he has been looking for a successor.\n\nDeutsche Bank and Achleitner declined to comment, as did Michele Faissola, CEO of Dilmon, a family office which looks after the Deutsche Bank investments held by members of the Al-Thani ruling family.\n\nThe soured relationship between Achleitner and the Qataris was described by 10 individuals, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nTURNAROUND EFFORTS\n\nThe move against Achleitner underscores the deep frustration with the Austrian. Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price has dropped 70% since he took on his role in 2012.\n\nAchleitner survived a motion to remove him at this year\u2019s annual general meeting.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs banker, who has overseen multiple changes of chief executive at Deutsche, has failed to arrest the decline of the bank. Earlier this year, merger talks with state-backed Commerzbank foundered.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s aggressive expansion into investment banking has left it with multibillion euro fines for misconduct and years of losses.\n\nAfter previously being criticized for moving too slowly to scale back the investment bank, Achleitner has supported Chief Executive Christian Sewing\u2019s deeper overhaul to focus on Germany.\n\nSewing in turn has voiced support. \u201cI am happy that he is here,\u201d he said in September at a conference hosted by a regional German newspaper.\n\nA CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThe two primary Qatari investors are former Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al-Thani and Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani.\n\nIn 2016, when Achleitner was under pressure over Deutsche\u2019s performance, Al-Thani\u2019s investment vehicle Paramount came out in support of him, in a rare public statement.\n\nSince then, relations have cooled.\n\nAt Qatar\u2019s behest, Achleitner in August nominated Zeltner, a former UBS executive, onto the supervisory board.\n\nBut Deutsche\u2019s regulators saw a conflict of interest because Zeltner is chief executive of KBL European Private Bankers, a business that overlaps with Deutsche\u2019s and is controlled by members of Qatar\u2019s royal family.\n\nRegulators at the European Central Bank and Germany\u2019s financial markets watchdog BaFin blocked the appointment this month.\n\nIt was an embarrassing misstep for Achleitner, one of Germany\u2019s best-connected corporate heavyweights, who is currently a director of Monsanto-owner Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and previously the Chief Financial Officer at insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE) .\n\nSome regulators griped privately that Achleitner failed to informally clear Zeltner\u2019s appointment with them before making it public, according to a senior official.\n\nA name several investors floated as a potential candidate to replace Achleitner is Theodor Weimer, currently CEO of Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE). Deutsche Boerse declined to comment but a person close to Weimer said he was in the midst of extending his current three-year contract.\n\nAnother is Nikolaus von Bomhard, currently chair of the boards of Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE).
