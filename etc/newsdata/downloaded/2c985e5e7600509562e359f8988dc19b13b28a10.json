He noticed her outgoing personality and she, his strong back. He asked her out to dinner. She said yes. Three years later, they got married and had a child. But, unlike their romance, their living arrangement is far from a fairy tale.\n\nLok, 31, lives with her parents in North Point, in Hong Kong Island\u2019s Eastern District. It is more than an hour away from the island of Tsing Yi, where 35-year-old Chau lives with his parents. Their three-year-old daughter, Yu, spends Monday to Thursday with Lok and the weekend at Chau\u2019s. They can\u2019t move in together in one of their family homes, Lok says, because the bedroom space is simply too small for two adults and a child.", "description": "Could you live an hour from your spouse?
