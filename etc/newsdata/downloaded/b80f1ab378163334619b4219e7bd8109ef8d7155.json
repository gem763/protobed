Guo is secretary of the powerful Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which oversees all law enforcement, including the secret police.\n\nIn a television interview with Chinese state-owned media organisation CGTN, Bridges said his impression of China\u2019s progress and development was one of \u201camazement\u201d. \u201cIt was always changing \u2026 it keeps developing, you can feel the prosperity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last 70 years in China has seen the most remarkable economic transformation in history, it has taken more people out of poverty than ever before.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand former PM denies writing glowing pro-China piece for Beijing paper Read more\n\n\u201cAll in all it\u2019s an amazing story and it\u2019s one I think New Zealanders relate to because we have been direct beneficiaries of it as well.\u201d\n\nBridges later wrote on Facebook: \u201cToday the economy has been transformed and they are rightly proud of the hundreds of millions who have been lifted out of poverty.\u201d\n\nProfessor Anne Marie Brady of Canterbury university, an expert on Chinese politics, described Guo as \u201cin charge of China\u2019s secret police\u201d.\n\nYou can feel the prosperity Simon Bridges\n\nShe said the Communist party used links with other parties to form bridges with other governments, and in return offered \u201cstatus, trips to China & BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] events, as well as access to CCP [Chinese Communist party] leaders for business opportunities.\u201d\n\nBrady\u2019s alarm at the meeting was echoed by other New Zealand China experts. Stephen Noakes, a senior lecturer in Chinese politics at Auckland university tweeted: \u201cBridges\u2019 comments re Xi\u2019s China are bonkers.\u201d David Capie, director of the centre for strategic studies at Victoria University of Wellington described Bridges\u2019 comments to CGTN as \u201cextraordinary\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlarming to have such a big gap between govt & opposition views/language concerning such a critical relationship.\u201d Capie tweeted.\n\nSimon Bridges (@simonjbridges) A privilege to be at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to meet with Guo Shengkun to discuss the many areas our countries have in common and how we can strengthen ties. pic.twitter.com/HpX5yNaI2s\n\nBridges was also questioned about the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong, and appeared to veer from the New Zealand government\u2019s cautious position by again praising China and failing to mention the democratic right to protest.\n\n\u201cWe understand and accept China\u2019s sovereignty in Hong Kong. We want to see the peaceful resolution. I think the recent step around the extradition bill, to remove it, that\u2019s been very positive,\u201d Bridges said.\n\nA spokesperson for Bridges refused to say if the opposition leader was aware of Guo\u2019s links to secret police, but said the visit to China was paid for out of the leader\u2019s budget.\n\nBridges told New Zealand media that his meetings in China had been overblown mischaracterised and the superpower was a valuable trading partner. Bridges emphatically denied he had had any dealings with the secret police.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming in about this guy, he\u2019s the secret police guy, what he is is one of the leaders of China \u2013 in the top 25 \u2013 who is their justice and law and order spokesperson. I\u2019d say with the greatest respect, be a bit responsible\u201d,\u201d Bridges said.\n\nForeign minister Winston Peters has been contacted for comment.", "description": "Simon Bridges said he was \u2018amazed\u2019 by China\u2019s prosperity and also met Guo Shengkun, who is believed to have links to secret police", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9dcd182274966fa8f946b39dcf8b1e382463dc/0_162_4854_2912/master/4854.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b5f046b59c71b74b3e1445c1c9d64cb", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
