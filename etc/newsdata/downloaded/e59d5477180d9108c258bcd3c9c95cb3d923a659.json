REUTERS/Ognen Teofilovski\n\nNorth Macedonia, Albania and four other Balkan countries - Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia - are trying to join the 28-nation political and trading group following the ethnic wars of the 1990s that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\n\nBut though member states see their eventual membership as inevitable, debate on starting the years-long accession process became emotional at an EU summit in Brussels and lasted into the early hours of Friday, an EU diplomat said.\n\nMacron said the membership bids of Albania and North Macedonia could not progress until the EU changes how and when candidates are vetted on meeting accession targets which range from economic policy to human rights and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cHe stuck to his position despite an attempt by Germany and others to draft a new position,\u201d an EU diplomat said after talks which one envoy described as emotional.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said it was \u201can historic error\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe had to start membership talks, I\u2019m very disappointed,\u201d Conte told reporters.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said the accession of Balkan countries was an important strategic issue, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ll see how to get back to this debate later.\u201d\n\nCONCERNS ABOUT RUSSIA AND CHINA\n\nCroatia joined the EU in 2013. Warning of the risk of inflaming the region by failing to offer EU membership, the European Commission, the EU executive, wants other ex-Yugoslav republics and Kosovo brought into the EU fold to shield them from what they see as the growing influence of China and Russia.\n\nThey say blocking their accession damages the credibility of the EU.\n\nIn Brussels on the eve of the summit, North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said China and Russia would \u201cfill in the vacuum\u201d left by the Europeans and urged EU leaders \u201cnot to fade out the bright stars\u201d of the European Union flag.\n\nNorth Macedonia\u2019 foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, tweeted: \u201cThe least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us. If there is no more consensus on the European future of the Western Balkans ... the citizens deserve to know.\u201d\n\nAfter Skopje agreed to end a dispute with Greece over the country\u2019s name - changing from Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Republic of North Macedonia - German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Paris to at least allow it to start talks.\n\nBut all countries have to agree before approval is given for accession talks.\n\nAll countries except France backed opening membership talks with North Macedonia, which is judged to have met EU targets for a host of reforms and ending disputes with its neighbours.\n\nBut France won support from Denmark and the Netherlands in its resistance to giving Albania\u2019s bid the green light, citing a need to deep measures to tackle corruption and organised crime.\n\n\u201cIt was 27 against one,\u201d a second diplomat said of the support for North Macedonian membership talks.\n\nParis says the EU faces too many challenges to let in two more states from the Balkans, a region still scarred by the legacy of 1990s wars and struggling with crime and corruption.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis attend the second day of the European Union leaders summit dominated by Brexit, in Brussels, Belgium October 18, 2019.
