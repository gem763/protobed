The newcomers are Ivy City\u2019s industrial-chic Gravitas, hearth-fired Middle Eastern hot spot Maydan, Capitol Hill cafe-cum-wine-bar Little Pearl, and Sushi Nakazawa, the New York import located in the Trump hotel.\n\nAD\n\nOne venerable restaurant, Foggy Bottom new American staple Blue Duck Tavern, was bumped off the one-star list. (Another previously starred restaurant, Robert Wiedmaier\u2019s Siren, closed.)\n\nAD\n\nFor stargazers tracking the changes, the 2020 list might have contained a surprise: no Bad Saint, the tiny Filipino hot spot that has garnered national attention. Bad Saint had previously been included on the guidebook\u2019s list of cheap eats (known as the Bib Gourmand designation) but was left off that 2020 list announced last week. The omission this year had some wondering if Bad Saint would graduate to the list of starred restaurants, but it did not.\n\nAn acclaimed French chef is suing over a lost Michelin star. It all started with a cheesy allegation.\n\nA Michelin inspector spoke with us over the phone about the changes, though the company\u2019s hypersensitivity to the anonymity of its reviewers meant he spoke only on the condition that his name be withheld.\n\nAD\n\nFirst, a word about Michelin\u2019s behind-the-scenes process, which has come under more scrutiny than ever since a famed French chef sued the company for demoting his restaurant from three stars to two, claiming that the guide violated its policy of multiple visits.\n\nAD\n\nOf Blue Duck, the inspector said, the decision to \u201csuppress\u201d a star is one the company takes seriously. If a meal at a starred restaurant is off, another inspector will go in for a visit. (Likewise, he says, if an inspector has a meal at an unstarred restaurant that suggests it is star-worthy, another inspector visits to weigh in.) On both visits to the Foggy Bottom restaurant, he said \u201cthe technique and quality weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nAs for the additions, he praised Little Pearl\u2019s \u201cgreat value\u201d; said that Maydan\u2019s live-fire cooking \u201cdazzled us\u201d; praised \u201cthe quality of product and skill going into the meal\u201d at Sushi Nakazawa; and said Gravitas \u201cright away struck us as [offering] star-caliber cuisine.\u201d\n\nThe addition of Little Pearl, the Capitol Hill gem that transforms, Batman-like, from a cafe by day to a wine bar by night, is a coup for chef and owner Aaron Silverman. He\u2019s also the force behind two-star Pineapples and Pearls and one-star Rose\u2019s Luxury, which means all three of his properties now have stars, a feat unmatched by other Washington chefs with multiple restaurants.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGet Voraciously\u2019s Baking Basics newsletter and learn the techniques that make baking a piece of cake\n\nKnowing the drill from previous years \u2014 representatives from Michelin call the morning the list is published \u2014 Silverman told The Washington Post he was waiting with a question. \u201cI was going to ask them what I needed to do to bring Little Pearl up to the level\u201d of a star, he said.\n\nAnd when he was informed that it was a fait accompli? \u201cI was blown away,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the staff, it\u2019s a recognition of their hard work. That sounds cliche, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nHe and his staff had already celebrated the night before; they hosted a collaborative dinner in honor of the Michelin list with fellow one-stars Bresca and the Dabney. \u201cWe do it ahead of time, so there\u2019s no pressure about who got how many stars,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not about stars; it\u2019s about the D.C. restaurant community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs for Bad Saint losing its Bib status, our inspector says, \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely restaurant and well deserves to be a local favorite. But the pricing didn\u2019t align with the Bib\u201d list. The criteria for that list is that two courses plus a glass of wine or dessert should come in at $40 before tax and tip. (In our upcoming fall dining guide, we list Bad Saint\u2019s main courses as ranging from $16-$40; last fall\u2019s guide listed the range at $13-$30.)\n\nAD\n\nThe Michelin star as a measurement of a restaurant might feel a bit dusty. The designation was created almost a century ago by a tire company with the goal of getting diners out on the road (and wearing out those treads!) to discover far-flung gastronomic destinations. These days, we\u2019re eating hyperlocally and more concerned about our carbon footprint than the joys of burning rubber.\n\nBut the star system chugs along.\n\nOne way Michelin is looking to keep up with the times? The company is emphasizing the globe-spanning cuisines on the list. The inspector noted that 36 cuisines are represented in the 130 Washington establishments on the list (which includes the starred establishments, the Bib Gourmands, and a slew of others that merely get the moniker of \u201cMichelin Plates\u201d). Seven appear on the starred list, a coterie that got a boost from the addition of Maydan\u2019s Middle Eastern-meets-African offerings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat was really exciting this year,\u201d he said, \u201cwas that Washington further expressed its rich diversity.\u201d\n\nAnd geographic diversity a little closer to home could be on its way, he added. Since the Michelin guide first came to Washington, there\u2019s been talk about expanding its reach into the gastronomically fertile \u2019burbs ringing the city.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re definitely talking about for the future,\u201d he said.\n\nGwendal Poullennec, international director of the Michelin Guides, said the company could be bringing its signature little red books to other U.S. cities, though he declined to identify what metropolis might be in the mix. \u201cThe U.S. is a very interesting culinary market,\u201d he said. And he served this heads-up to restaurateurs across the land: \u201cWe always have inspectors in the field.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of Washington\u2019s 2020 Michelin starred restaurants:\n\nAD\n\nThree Stars:\n\nThe Inn at Little Washington\n\nTwo stars:\n\nPineapples and Pearls\n\nMinibar\n\nOne star:\n\nBresca\n\nThe Dabney\n\nFiola\n\nGravitas\n\nKinship\n\nKomi\n\nLittle Pearl\n\nMasseria\n\nMayd\u0101n\n\nM\u00e9tier\n\nPlume\n\nRose\u2019s Luxury\n\nSushi Nakazawa\n\nSushi Taro\n\nTail Up Goat\n\nMore from Food:\n\nTo David Chang, the \u2018ethnic\u2019 food aisle is racist.
