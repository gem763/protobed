What\u2019s harder to talk about is the way that the tonal specificity of the show is maintained through the serious-silly dialogue. The characters, themselves, are highly aware of their lives as drama. It\u2019s a heavy situation they\u2019re in, after all: battling for control of a global organization so powerful that it has a body count, led by a man who would sacrifice his own son. This drama, the characters realize, is stuff of the Greeks and Shakespeare but also of Mamet and Sorkin. They\u2019ve read the myths; they\u2019ve absorbed their rhetoric; they\u2019ve put their spin on it.\n\nRead: \u2018Succession\u2019 is better than ever\n\nBut within the world of the show, these characters are not poetic heroes created by accomplished writers. They are just pretentious humans with foot fungus. They are dorks who yell things such as, \u201cThe early bird gets the best cabin!\u201d (Connor, played by Alan Ruck) or, \u201cDid you, like, build a glider out of a Caesar salad?\u201d (Tom). Succession\u2019s weird realism comes from the halfway-profundities and failed jokes and borrowed small talk of characters who don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re trying to say and who are terrified of revealing their true natures. The finale crystallized the show\u2019s acidic insights about how and why people natter.\n\nMost obviously and perhaps most surprisingly, Roman (Kieran Culkin) emerged as a critic of empty snark and pomposity. When he arrived at the family yacht after being held hostage in Turkey, the rest of the Waystar Royco clan greeted him with bratty, amoral sarcasm very much in Roman\u2019s typical style. Kendall (Jeremy Strong) asked who he gave oral sex to in order to escape; Tom made the Caesar salad comment. The only apt barb came from Gerri (J. Smith-Cameron): \u201cThat would have been really traumatizing if you weren\u2019t already so fucked up!\u201d Roman didn\u2019t play along with the roast. \u201cIt was actually fucking scary and we thought that they might kill us,\u201d he deadpanned.\n\nSoon after that he floated the idea to his brother and sister that they should communicate about their feelings more. They immediately mocked that proposal with silly voices, the universal language of sibling hatred and emotional deflection. When it came time for Roman to report to his father, Logan (Brian Cox), about the vital financial negotiations in Turkey, Roman delivered some difficult straight talk: Even though he\u2019d secured verbal assurances from financiers, he didn\u2019t trust the deal.\n\nHonesty of that sort, from a Roy kid to his father, is hard to come by on Succession. In the riveting meal scene during which Logan made his team debate who among them would be the \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d to potentially go to jail, Kendall offered this telling line: \u201cI\u2019m saying this, but I don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m saying it because this is the time we\u2019re all saying things.\u201d Of course, what underlaid each participant\u2019s case for throwing someone else to the jackals weren\u2019t tactics, or truth, but personal prerogatives. At one point, Logan asked why Roman was defending Gerri, and he replied that he was just giving his \u201copinion.\u201d Viewers know he\u2019s personally entangled with Gerri, and they may assume that\u2019s why he spoke up. But then he came up with a decent strategic rationale: Crucifying a woman to deal with a sexual-harassment problem isn\u2019t a good look. His saying that may have been spin, but it was also true.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m saying this, but I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Kendall Roy, in the Season 2 finale, summed up what makes the show such brilliant satire.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/18789cfa4cd1197ccbb7591076cb15aac90256fafa347ac79b0c48b83cda8b82d5867a727f110583a6e1fa525502d24a23d40f8be27ad40c20c3dd5a89ce2566/facebook.jpg?1571174258", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
