That\u2019s because the microphones have to be turned on before the anchors start speaking. You don\u2019t want the microphones to pick up the floor director counting the anchors down.\u201d\n\nCan you knit a quilt? Of course not. And Marco Polo didn\u2019t ride a llama to China.\n\nThank you, Matt of Sacramento. And thank you to all the other readers who have been sending me examples of things the media gets wrong.\n\nThat includes George Hamlin of Clarksville, Md. What bugs him? \u201cGiving the audience a view through binoculars and what you see is two adjoining circles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe actual view through binoculars is one circle.\u201d\n\nBut how would we know the character is looking through binoculars and not a telescope? (It\u2019s easy to tell when they\u2019re looking through a kaleidoscope.)\n\nLet\u2019s call them \u2018Things That Hollywood Gets Wrong\u2019\n\nDavid Ballard of Reston, Va., is impressed by how strong characters on TV and in movies must be. How else to explain how easily they pick up heavy suitcases and toss them around as if they were weightless. Could it be that these prop suitcases are, in fact, empty?\n\nDavid admits to being somewhat intolerant.\n\n\u201cDue to my rather persistent harping about this, other viewers in my family, perhaps influenced by my petty scorn, have been known to denounce out loud the presence of a \u2018movie suitcase\u2019 when watching a movie or show,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLaura Key of Burke, Va., has a similar complaint. \u201cA pet peeve of mine are the actors pretending to have full coffee cups and teetering around the cardboard trays with four \u2018full\u2019 coffee cups or moving their arms around with coffee cups,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey cannot even fake holding a full cup of coffee. It still counts as bad acting. Put some weights inside or fill the cups with water, please.\n\nLaura has a kindred spirit in Sarah Corcoran of Takoma Park, Md., who confesses to being made crazy by empty-cup syndrome.\n\n\u201cIn TV shows and movies, when they use an obviously empty cup to \u2018drink\u2019 coffee or another drink, it drives me to distraction every time,\u201d Sarah wrote. \u201cIf it\u2019s a paper or lightweight cup, you can always tell by how they hold the cup that there is nothing in it. Just put a rock in it! Or water!\u201d\n\nThe District\u2019s Janet Tersoff is irritated by another type of emptiness. \u201cFor me it\u2019s figure skating,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn movies, they often show the big competition in a darkened arena with spotlights on the skater. This never happens in real life, but I believe they simply don\u2019t want to pay extras to fill all of those seats.\u201d\n\nAn online commenter to one of my earlier columns pointed out another error: A desperate character thwarts the bad guy or summons the police by holding a match or lighter under a sprinkler head, causing all the sprinkler heads on the floor or in the building to start gushing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way sprinklers work,\u201d this person wrote. \u201cEach head has a glass bulb filled with a fluid that will expand and boil under heat until the bulb shatters, allowing water to spray from the head. Exposing a single sprinkler head to a flame will only set off that one head.\u201d\n\nI checked with the folks at the National Fire Sprinkler Association, who assured me the reader was correct. \u201cFire sprinklers are heat activated and only the head closest to the fire goes off,\u201d wrote the association\u2019s Vickie Pritchett.\n\nGot that, screenwriters?\n\nBarb Roach said her two sons, Dale and Erik, were fortunate enough to go dog sledding in Northern Minnesota with their Alexandria, Va., Boy Scout troop several years ago.\n\n\u201cThey reported that Hollywood gets it wrong whenever you see a line of dogs pulling a sled and barking as they glide through a winter scene,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey said the dogs bark like crazy at all times (especially as you get out their harnesses) except when they are running. They are working so hard that they are silent as they run!\u201d\n\nMe? I gasp and wheeze when I run.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Sprinkler heads that gush like waterfalls are just one of the things Hollywood gets wrong.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4ZMRQEW5QYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
