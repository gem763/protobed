When I bring it up, he says he loves me and that my worry about the relationship is unfounded and that he doesn't want to get in an argument. But I can't remember the last time I felt special with him or when he last wanted to spend time with me.\n\nI'm not asking for anything special, just a dinner spent not watching TV or a day where we actually do something together. I'm wondering if I'm wasting my life on someone who has no space for me and if maybe I should move on and make my plans separately.\n\n\u2014 Back Burner\n\nBack Burner: It certainly sounds possible that he\u2019s just not interested in spending time with you; I\u2019m sorry. His disengagement could also be a symptom of undiagnosed depression or the anxiety talking.\n\nInstead of \u201cmove on and make my plans separately,\u201d though, you might try reversing that \u2014 make your plans separately and then, if necessary, move on. By that I mean, plan the dinner not watching TV, plan the thing you would like to do together, and do it \u2014 with him or without.\n\nIf he goes along, then there you have it; his mental health is likely the obstacle, and your planning it will make you and your marriage more accessible to him.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t go along, then commit unflinchingly to the plan B \u2014 go with a friend instead, or see the movie/performance solo, etc. This way, you\u2019ll be living more of the life you want, at least, while you figure out what\u2019s happening in your marriage, instead of logging in another lonely dinner glued to the tube.\n\nPlus, changing things up in this nonbinding way will likely give you a different view of what\u2019s happening \u2014 quite literally, when your plans take you out of the house \u2014 which tends to expand comprehension. You\u2019ve obviously stared at this problem for a long time, so now it\u2019s time to walk away from it for a bit.\n\nThis is especially useful in response to \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to get in an argument\u201d claims. Regardless of how he got there, his saying this tells you he\u2019s through discussing with you.\n\nIn fact, if that\u2019s his answer to everything, including your assurances that you just want to talk or just want his company or just want to change things up, then it\u2019s time to explore the possibility the marriage isn\u2019t viable. In deference to your husband\u2019s health issues, begin this exploration process with a therapist qualified to address whatever his ailment is. That expertise can help you sort out \u2014 in solo appointments to start \u2014 how much of your marital neglect you can reasonably attribute to his illness, how much you can\u2019t, and how likely things are to improve with (potential) treatment. It won\u2019t be that black and white, but it is a place to start.", "description": "Making plans on her own might help this wife get a new perspective on the situation.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NXBGEYGWOMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
