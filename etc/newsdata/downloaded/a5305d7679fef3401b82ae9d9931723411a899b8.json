The company already offers a mobile-app feature that lets customers total up items in store so they know exactly what they will pay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to be at the leading edge of value and convenience, and we hear our customers talking about this a lot,\u201d Mr. Wenkoff said, referring to the ability to purchase online and pick up in store.\n\nCarman Wenkoff, chief information officer at Dollar General.

Dollar Tree Inc. allows customers to purchase items online and have them shipped to a store, while Five Below Inc. doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve tried to do with technology is to come up with a strategy on how to enhance the shopping experience,\u201d said Mr. Wenkoff, who joined Dollar General in 2017 from sandwich chain Subway, where he was CIO and chief digital officer. Dollar General hired him in part to improve its online payment tools, loyalty programs and other customer-facing services. The retailer has had an e-commerce site for about eight years.\n\nTo make the buy-online, pick-up-in-store feature work, Mr. Wenkoff\u2019s team will need to integrate the mobile app with several data systems and applications that have information about the company\u2019s supply chain and inventory. If an item is out of stock, the app could suggest similar items that are available. It could also let customers use digital coupons on items purchased online.\n\nAbout 45% of Dollar General customers use digital tools from Dollar General or other retailers when shopping, the company said.\n\nSuch \u201cdigitally engaged customers\u201d spend twice as much as the average checkout receipt, which is about $12, Dollar General said.\n\nThe company\u2019s digital tools include the \u201ccart calculator\u201d feature in one of its mobile apps, which lets in-store customers calculate the exact total of items in their cart, including taxes and discounts, before they go up to the cash register. It is available in about 75% of stores. Another feature lets customers know when a coupon is available for an item in their cart.\n\nIn about 250 stores, the mobile app also lets customers scan and pay for items in store using their phones, skipping the checkout line. The feature is expanding to 500 more stores by early next year, the company said.\n\nThe initiative to buy online and pickup in store will be a slow test, said Dollar General\u2019s chief executive, Todd Vasos, in an August earnings call: \u201cWe want to make sure that the consumer resonates with that.\u201d\n\nSome cost-conscious customers who are pressed for time will find that the ability to order items online and pick them up in store adds another level of convenience, said Anthony Chukumba, managing director and senior research analyst at Loop Capital Markets LLC.\n\nBut the move is unlikely to make a significant impact for most customers because Dollar General stores aren\u2019t huge and items are easy to find, he said.\n\nMarshal Cohen, chief retail analyst at market-research firm NPD Group Inc., said the move could help the company attract customers between the ages of 21 and 37, who are set to become more cost-conscious as the economy shows signs of cooling down.\n\nHistorically, Dollar General\u2019s average consumer has been between 35 and 55, Mr. Cohen said. The younger demographic is digitally savvy and \u201call about convenience,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody even wants to get out of the car anymore.\u201d\n\nPRO TIPS Strategy insights from Dollar General\u2019s chief information officer, Carman Wenkoff: Customers are much more likely to adopt a new technology if the user experience is good.\n\nDon\u2019t get distracted by risky \u201cbleeding-edge technologies\u201d that might not pay off, such as the use of virtual reality in retail.\n\nBuilding technology for cost-conscious customers requires thinking differently. Dollar General recently said it is consolidating its two apps into one: \u201cOur customers are on a fairly tight budget which means they have limited data and memory on their phones. We wanted to make that app as light as possible,\u201d Mr. Wenkoff said.\n\nWrite to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com", "description": "The discount-store chain is working on making it possible for customers to buy its wares online and pick them up at a nearby store, a move that analysts say could help the retailer attract a younger demographic.", "authors": ["Sara Castellanos", "Sara.Castellanos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-114965/social", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
