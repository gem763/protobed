I have not seen the play, but I read the script last night, and I kept thinking: this really can\u2019t be this good, can it? It is. People like me \u2014 politically and religiously conservative \u2014 don\u2019t expect to encounter contemporary art about ourselves. Reading Heroes brought to my mind the one other time in my life when I encountered serious art that was about my people: discovering the short stories of Flannery O\u2019Connor in high school.\u201d\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company cuts its eight-relationship with BP short. Some person who has a very strange view of art and co-directs an organization called \u201cCulture Unstained\u201d said the decision was \u201cfantastic news.\u201d\n\nAnthony Sattin reviews William Dalrymple\u2019s The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company: \u201cIn three of his previous books, Dalrymple brought us the gloriously detailed stories of Britons who fell for Indians or India; of the last King of Delhi in what the British call the Indian Mutiny and the Indians call the First War of Independence; and of the First Afghan War. The East India Company was a major player in each of those stories, but now Dalrymple has brought the Company center stage. And here there should be a warning: the spotlight reveals truths you might find very uncomfortable, which is exactly what revisionist history aims to do.\u201d\n\nThe puzzle of Delacroix\u2019s violent Lion Hunt: \u201cThat Delacroix himself was in love with the subject \u2013 dangerously, scandalously \u2013 is part of the story. \u2018My painting is a turpitude,\u2019 he said to a young admirer. There is always a thin line, that is, between showing violence and \u2018aestheticising\u2019 it, and it is never certain what the effect of either will be. But again, what kept me looking and thinking in front of Delacroix at his best was (and remains) the mobility \u2013 the strangeness and humanity \u2013 of his treatment of the theme. \u2018The sensation of the terrible,\u2019 he wrote in his journal in 1857, \u2018and, even more, that of the horrible, is not to be borne for very long \u2026 The terrible in art is a natural gift like that of grace \u2026 Shakespeare alone could make spirits talk.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe story of medicinal lithium: \u201cLithium is a silvery-white metal that is so light it can float on water and so soft it can be cut with a butter knife. Along with hydrogen and helium it was produced during the Big Bang and so formed the universe before the emergence of the galaxies. It is employed to harden glass and to thicken grease, but its best-known industrial use is in the manufacture of rechargeable batteries. Lithium salts are found in considerable quantities in brine and igneous granite and the element is present in trace quantities in the human body. Lithium is also one of the few metals \u2013 along with platinum for cancer, gold for rheumatoid arthritis and bismuth for dyspepsia \u2013 that are used as medicines. In 1949, a 37-year-old Australian doctor called John Cade produced a paper reporting that lithium quietened patients suffering from acute manic excitement. He reminded readers that lithium salts had been commonly used in the 19th century to treat gout and other disorders believed to be associated with high uric acid levels but had disappeared from the pharmacopoeia due to safety concerns. He then went on to describe a series of preclinical experiments he had carried out in a disused kitchen that had led him to consider lithium as a treatment for both manic depression (now often called bipolar disorder) and epilepsy.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nCan politics be too moral? That seems like a dumb question given the current state of governing and political discourse. But in National Affairs, Greg Weiner argues that the answer is yes:\n\n\u201cOn July 10, 1919, the chaplain of the U.S. Senate, Reverend Forrest Prettyman, opened the chamber\u2019s day on a world-historical note, praying that \u2018the God of our fathers will lead us on and fulfill the great design in us as a Nation.\u2019 After dispatching some routine business, Vice President Thomas Marshall introduced the guest whose appearance prompted the chaplain\u2019s millenarian tone: Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States and \u2018first citizen of the world,\u2019 fresh from his triumph at Versailles, the first chief executive since George Washington to visit the Senate and personally deliver a treaty.\n\n\u201cHis case for the Treaty of Versailles and its centerpiece, the League of Nations \u2014 the latter of which had already been under assault in the Senate for months \u2014 was mostly workmanlike. It was not until the peroration that Wilson\u2019s tenor did justice to the grandiosity of Prettyman\u2019s invocation. The cause of the war was now not mere national interest, as it had been when Wilson sought a declaration of war in 1917 on the grounds of Germany\u2019s unrestricted submarine warfare. The war was now a moral crusade: \u2018It was our duty to go in, if we were indeed the champions of liberty and of right. We answered to the call of duty in a way so spirited, so utterly without thought of what we spent of blood or treasure\u2026so wrought out of the stuff of all that was heroic, that the whole world saw at last, in the flesh, in noble action, a great ideal asserted and vindicated, by a nation they had deemed material and now found to be compact of the spiritual forces that must free men of every nation from every unworthy bondage. It is thus that a new role and a new responsibility have come to this great nation that we honour and which we would all wish to lift to yet higher levels of service and achievement.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn his vaunted closing, Wilson declared that \u2018[t]he stage [was] set\u2026by the hand of God\u2026.We cannot turn back. We can only go forward\u2026.The light streams upon the path ahead, and nowhere else.\u2019\n\n\u201cWilson was known as a moralizer of Olympian proportions. Robert Nisbet recounted in The Present Age: Progress and Anarchy in Modern America that \u2018[v]irtually everything [Wilson] touched became instantly transformed into an Armageddon.\u2019 All the features of Wilson\u2019s moralism are evident in the 1919 Senate speech: There was no moral choice other than the path Wilson wanted to take, no prudential discretion; only the \u2018light\u2019 on his path or the apparent darkness encasing any other. A prudential matter of statecraft became a moral crusade, with God called into its service. There was no limit to the blood or treasure that would be expended to succeed. That premise of limitless commitment was itself absurd. But even when the aim was purportedly achieved, the fact of success itself rechanneled moral energies to \u2018yet higher\u2019 goals.\n\n\u201cThis is the essence of moralistic politics. It is different from politics oriented toward moral ends.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Wildenhof Chapel\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
