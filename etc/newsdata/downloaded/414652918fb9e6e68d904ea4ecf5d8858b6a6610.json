With Rice a regular, the onus is more on Mount to show us what he can offer.\n\nOn Friday they have the chance to persuade the England manager to start them together more\n\nIf Southgate opts for 4-3-3, he is likely to be on the left of Rice with Jordan Henderson on the right. If 4-2-3-1, Mount could be a No 10.\n\nWe have grown used to seeing the versatile playmaker in that role for Chelsea, though the left side of midfield is not alien to him. He has been used there under Frank Lampard this season too.\n\nI don't see him struggling in either role for England.
