For two years, she worked six or seven days a week, sometimes as much as 17 hours a day. She made about $50,000 a year.\n\n\u201cIt was enough to live on then. It wouldn\u2019t be now,\u201d Ms. Milland said.\n\nThe work at that time didn\u2019t really involve A.I. For another project, she would pull information out of mortgage documents or retype names and addresses from photos of business cards, sometimes for as little as a dollar an hour.\n\nAround 2010, she started labeling for A.I. projects. Ms. Milland tagged all sorts of data, like gory images that showed up on Twitter (which helps build A.I. that can help remove gory images from the social network) or aerial footage likely taken somewhere in the Middle East (presumably for A.I. that the military and its partners are building to identify drone targets).\n\nProjects from American tech giants, Ms. Milland said, typically paid more than the average job \u2014 about $15 an hour. But the job didn\u2019t come with health care or paid vacation, and the work could be mind-numbing \u2014 or downright disturbing. She called it \u201chorrifically exploitative.\u201d Amazon declined to comment.\n\nSince 2012, Ms. Milland, now 40, has been part of an organization called TurkerNation, which aims to improve conditions for thousands of people who do this work. In April, after 14 years on the service, she quit.\n\nShe is in law school, and her husband makes $600 less than they pay in rent each month, which does not include utilities. So, she said, they are preparing to go into debt. But she will not go back to labeling data.\n\n\u201cThis is a dystopian future,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am done.\u201d", "description": "Artificial intelligence is being taught by thousands of office workers around the world.
