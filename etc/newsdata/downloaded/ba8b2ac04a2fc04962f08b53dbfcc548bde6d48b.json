Anonymous performances in the Champions League final and in the Nations League finals with England preceded a much needed break.\n\nExcept after resuming pre-season training, Alli injured his hamstring again and it has restricted him to just four appearances this term.\n\nOnly 30 minutes of those have come in the Premier League at Arsenal, while the only time he has completed a full game was in the humiliating League Cup exit at Colchester United.\n\nAlli's poor form then looks like it stretches back to January. In a perfect storm it resulted in him returning to a Spurs side who have looked woeful with or without him since.\n\nBut there were signs of a decline before his Craven Cottage injury. He became less of a key figure in the Spurs squad during last term - with early reasons for that being put down to a lack of rest and a pre-season following that long World Cup summer with England.\n\nAlli once wowed Spurs fans with classy finishes including last December in a win over Arsenal\n\nSPURS STATS 2015-16: 46 apps, 10 goals, 11 assists 2016-17: 50 apps, 22 goals, 13 assists 2017-18: 50 apps, 14 goals, 17 assists 2018-19: 38 apps, 7 goals, 8 assists 2019-20: 4 apps, 0 goals, 0 assists\n\nIn the Premier League last term his contribution dipped alarmingly in attack even when taking into account his injury lay-off.\n\nHe had 39 attempts on goal, 19 on target, from 25 games. That is on average 1.6 shots on goal per game.\n\nThat's down on the 2017-18 campaign where the average was around 1.9, and way off his peak season of 2016-17 where the figure was nearer 2.5. A possible reason for this could be down to teams simply finding out a way of playing against him - ideally nullifying him by closing him down much quicker.\n\nBut it could also be a change of tactics from Pochettino that has not helped his cause. Players far from happy with the diamond midfield, and he struggles to get involved in games in his advanced role up the pitch - often reduced to playing ambitious flicks and passes which rarely come off.\n\nAfter returning from injury, Alli struggled and was substituted in the Champions League final\n\nAlli's form for England has been just as poor and has led to Gareth Southgate dropping him\n\nFlair he once displayed that helped make Spurs so good to watch has all but disappeared.\n\nThe incredible control and volley against Crystal Palace in 2016, the clinical double to help Tottenham win at Chelsea two years later and his delightful lob to win the north London derby at the Emirates Stadium in December are now just symbols of what Alli once was.\n\nBut if Alli was just going through the motions, then being dropped from the England squad should be the wake-up call. This year alone he has gone from being a key player for club and country to an afterthought at both.\n\nAlli's long term England place is under serious threat following the emergence of Mason Mount\n\nJames Maddison has impressed at Leicester and has climbed above Alli in the pecking order\n\nAt Spurs he is no longer guaranteed a starting spot such is his ineffectiveness while England have three players who are offering far more end product in Ross Barkley, Mason Mount and James Maddison.\n\nThe positives for the 23-year-old is he is still young enough to bounce back. His malaise seems mainly to be down to his setbacks from injury and fatigue last term and having to return to a team in turmoil.\n\nUnfortunately, the latter especially means his struggles don't look like coming to a halt anytime soon. But there does also seem to be a confidence void in Alli who needs to rediscover his flamboyance that made him such an all-round threat for club and country.\n\nSpurs and England fans will just hope that there are still embers ready to turn into flames again rather than seeing a talented star burning out.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Dele Alli has been a key member of Tottenham Hotspur and England teams in the last few years but a torrid 2019 has seen him falling down the pecking order at both.", "authors": ["Dan Ripley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/15/19300288-0-image-a-16_1570198468766.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
