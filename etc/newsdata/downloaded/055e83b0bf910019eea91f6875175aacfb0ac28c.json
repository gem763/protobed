Woodstock was staged, and it\u2019s still with us in many ways.\n\nAlso, 50 years ago, a remarkable film was released starring John Wayne. Based on the novel by Charles Portis, \u201cTrue Grit\u201d has become one of the best loved Westerns of all time and the one for which the Duke finally got his Oscar as best actor.\n\nIn Ridgway, Colorado, where much of the movie was filmed, the community is going all out during the second weekend in October to honor the 50th anniversary of \u201cTrue Grit.\u201d The Old Town portion of Ridgway stood in for Fort Smith, Arkansas, and many sites are still there, including the park where hangings were held, the courthouse facade, the railroad depot and the saloon where the villain Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey) shoots the father of teenager Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) in the street.\n\nThat event triggers the film\u2019s theme, which is Mattie\u2019s courageous and relentless pursuit of justice. She\u2019s aided by Wayne and Texas Ranger LeBoeuf (Glen Campbell), who have baser motives (reward money) but, like Han Solo in \u201cStar Wars,\u201d come through in the clinch. By the way, just as Ridgway has no \u201ce,\u201d LeBouef has no first name.\n\nThe story is so good that the Coen Brothers made a more accurate albeit far-less scenic remake in 2010 starring Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld.\n\nRidgway\u2019s True Grit Cafe is a veritable shrine to Wayne, who died in 1979 at the age of 72 from cancer. He had already lost a lung before the filming, but went on to make \u201cRooster Cogburn\u201d (1975) and his last movie, \u201cThe Shootist\u201d (1976).\n\nWhen people do something big, it often leaves a legacy of good or ill. Woodstock, which culture critic Rabbi Daniel Lapin describes as a \u201cfinger in the eye of God,\u201d gave us some memorable pop music.\n\nBut the dark side of Woodstock left its mark. All too many baby boomers believed the lies of the sexual revolution and drug-themed music and became charter members of the Me Generation. The resulting wreckage \u2014 abortion, sexual anarchy, broken families, recreational drug use and perpetually adolescent citizens looking for handouts and someone else to blame \u2014 is Woodstock\u2019s enduring curse.\n\nColorado, blessed with stunning Rocky Mountain beauty, is a potent cultural mix of John Wayne and Woodstock.\n\nThe Duke\u2019s imprint is seen in the proud, independent Western culture all over the state. In a gun shop in Vallecito Lake in southwest Colorado, a woman shopkeeper happily showed me a lightweight AK-47-type rifle imprinted with \u201cSnowflake\u201d and \u201cBeto,\u201d after the Texas Democrat who is openly calling for the government to confiscate these types of rifles. American flags are everywhere. Washington, D.C., seems far, far away.\n\nBut you also see the state veering politically from purple to blue. Marijuana dispensaries and head shops are all over Denver and Colorado Springs. They\u2019re springing up even in remote mountain towns, along with Bernie stickers, which makes perfect sense. Bernie is selling a free ride; stoned people are not in the best frame of mind to defend their freedom against a sugar daddy government bent on creating a dependent population.\n\nSure, plenty of potheads distrust The Man and have figured out that big government is not their friend. But those folks lean libertarian, sucking away votes from conservatives and allowing Democrats to continue to build toward a Godless, socialist America.\n\nThe Democrats are now Woodstock on steroids. Get free stuff; smoke all the pot you want; watch all the porn you want; kill all the babies you want; change your God-given sex if you want. We\u2019ll even rig the law to force others to pretend with you. Just don\u2019t complain when we run the rest of your lives.\n\nBack in John Wayne country, you see his witticisms on plaques and mugs: \u201cCourage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway.\u201d \u201cLife is tough, but it\u2019s tougher when you\u2019re stupid.\u201d And: \u201cNever apologize and never explain; it\u2019s a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nFew people in Ridgway today were around when the movie was made. Visitors center volunteer Rick Gregory, 73, has spoken to several. He said they found the Duke far friendlier in person than his flawed, on-screen persona, federal Marshal Reuben J. \u201cRooster\u201d Cogburn. \u201cHe was very human, very popular, he made time for people,\u201d Mr. Gregory said, noting that when a production crew member\u2019s car broke down, Wayne bought him a new one.\n\nRidgway and nearby Ouray, where the courtroom scene was filmed, seem more Wayne than Woodstock. Near Owl Creek Pass (altitude 10,114 feet), you can easily find Deb\u2019s Meadow, the aspen-ringed field where Wayne as Rooster Cogburn charges his horse at four armed outlaws while firing a shotgun in each hand.\n\nIt takes faith and courage \u2014 true grit \u2014 to dare big and do great things. John Wayne did it superbly on screen.\n\nThe American astronauts who thrilled the entire world on July 20, 1969, risked their very lives. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were undoubtedly scared to death.\n\nBut they saddled up anyway.\n\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
