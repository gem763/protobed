The video was taken down by Sunday, with an explanation from Twitter: \u201cThis video has been removed in response to a report from the copyright holder.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign has been criticized repeatedly for unauthorized use of music from artists including Neil Young, Adele, Axl Rose, the Rolling Stones, Elton John \u2014 and Prince\u2019s estate just three days ago.
