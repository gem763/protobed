To be here as part of this franchise and to do something special like that and be on that list with those legends means a lot to me.\n\n\"What's more important is I'm happy that we got the win. It was a grind there in the first half. My team-mates trusted me, told me to get going, and that's what I tried to do.\"\n\nDavis, who managed 30 minutes, expanded on how he managed to perform despite niggling shoulder pain.\n\n\"I was really just trying to figure it all out. It was bothering me a lot, very sore,\" he said. \"But I didn't want to come out the game.\n\n\"I just came to the back and adjusted some things and felt good to go back out. I went back out and, late in the second, felt good.\n\n\"I did some more stuff at half-time and then went out in the third, just to test it out in the third, and it felt good. That was that.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I'm fine. It's still a little sore. I got hit a couple of times tonight. But there's a couple of days before we play again, so hopefully I'll feel better by then.\"\n\nCoach Frank Vogel added: \"He gutted it out despite playing in some pain. He was dominant \u2013 that's probably the word. He impacted the game on both ends of the floor.\"", "description": "A shoulder injury did not slow Anthony Davis as he became just the sixth player to go 40-20 for the Los Angeles Lakers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kiS5Fm2nxBx6LcxQkjRYbQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FjsZNJWiJMI9aFAf1JL7eg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/fe7f9b735685d99c02853ae1513de517", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
