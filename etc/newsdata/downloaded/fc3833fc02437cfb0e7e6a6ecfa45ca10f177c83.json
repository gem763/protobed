While digging this weekend the mole backed about halfway out of the ground. Preliminary assessment points to unexpected soil properties as the main reason.

The device \u2013 nicknamed \u201cmole\u201d \u2013 is supposed to reach a depth of 16 feet (5 meters) as part of research into how rocky planets such as Mars are formed. The digging began in February, several months after the lander touched down on the planet in November 2018.\n\nAlso on rt.com Mysterious magnetic pulses & evidence of groundwater discovered on Mars\n\nLike this story?
