The discussions further gained momentum in the last few years due to worsening asset quality of India banks in general and PSBs in particular.\n\nGiven the inherent systemic risk associated with banks for any economy, the Indian government took two key decisions \u2013 provide capital support to address the short-term solvency risk and merge weaker banks with stronger banks to address the long term structural risk.\n\nThe mergers are envisaged to create few large strong banks, reduce operational and infrastructural overlaps, bring in economies of scale and reduce government\u2019s oversight needs.\n\nFundamentally, I completely agree with the logic and rationale.\n\nAre the combinations perfect?\n\nThere are lot of factors that one needs to consider before deciding to merge two entities \u2013 size, geographical focus, customer profile, corporate structure, technology systems, capital structure, asset quality etc.\n\nGiven the diversity of factors, there can never be a perfect solution and any merger always involve compromises. The objective is to create best possible synergies with least possible headwinds.\n\nBased on various viewpoints and discussions happening around the subject, it\u2019s very difficult to comment whether the announced combinations perfectly meet this criteria. However, I believe that the government would have worked with the best possible available alternatives. While making the selections, I do believe that a greater emphasis has been put around the technological compatibilities of the merging banks \u2013 which is very critical to ensure a smooth operational integration.\n\nIs the timing correct?\n\nGovernment started the PSBs consolidation drive in 2016 and the current merger announcements are continuation of the same. The announcements coincided with the economic revival measures undertaken by the government recently.\n\nIn the last few months, there has been a continuous flow of negative news around the Indian economy and situation seems to have worsened drastically. GDP growth numbers are concerning, auto sales is at multi year lows, liquidity situation is tight, asset quality of banks continue to remain questionable, corporate bigwigs have sounded alarms, economists and analysts have cut down the estimates drastically.\n\nUnder the current economic situation, I personally see mergers announcement to create more hurdles in the recovery process. Mergers take time to settle down. There are varied interests that are required to be managed. Liquidity in the market is tight and government has been trying hard to address the same.\n\nI sincerely hope that merger related disruptions don\u2019t create hurdles for the borrowers and further dent the already suppressed sentiments (my regular readers would relate this with my previous articles, wherein time and again I have been highlighting poor sentiments to be the main reason for the current economic slowdown).\n\nExamples of merger related disruptions for the borrowers \u2013 strikes by the trade unions, movement of banks\u2019 manpower, newsflow, tighter collateral/ credit terms/ information requirements from the borrowers of the weaker merging banks by the stronger anchor banks etc.\n\nAm I getting positive on PSBs?\n\nTraditionally, I have rarely invested in PSBs. Most of the times, my investments in the private sector have fared better due to varied reasons.\n\nHowever, I have a background of being a banking analyst and a value conscious investor \u2013 so yes, I do keep a watch on PSBs.\n\nWhether the announced mergers are making me attracted towards the PSBs\u2026\u2026. No !\n\nIt's a classic case where my heart says \u2018yes\u2019 but mind says \u2018no\u2019 \u2013 there are many variables that need to be kept in mind while making an investment decision. I continue to keep a close watch !\n\nIt's not important to buy every business that looks promising..... only the ones with higher conviction are important !Disclaimer: Above is my personal opinion and the reader should do his own independent research while taking a decision.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Nitin Jain covering: .
