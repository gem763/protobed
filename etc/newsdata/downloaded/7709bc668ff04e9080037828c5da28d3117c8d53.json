REUTERS/John Gress\n\nThe strike is the second-longest in a wave of teachers\u2019 strikes that played out across West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona and California over the past few years, topped only by a three-week strike in June in Union City, California.\n\nChicago Teachers Union leadership gave its 825 members of the House of Delegates an update on negotiations behind closed doors on Tuesday evening. It marked the first time since the strike began that the delegates met.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d union president Emerita Karen Lewis said in a Tuesday night statement, imploring Mayor Lori Lightfoot to make a deal.\n\n\u201cOur members have resolve and will not relent when it comes to the families they serve,\u201d she warned Lightfoot, for whom the strike represents the first major political test since election in April.\n\nThe third-largest school district in the United States has canceled classes for its 300,000 students every school day since the union went on strike on Oct. 17, after contract talks failed to yield agreement.\n\nThe union represents 25,000 teachers who have been without a contract since July 1. Since the first day of the work stoppage, teachers have picketed in front of many of the district\u2019s 500 schools and rallied several times in downtown Chicago.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful and we are close, really close to a deal,\u201d said Allison Bates, 43, an elementary school science and social studies teacher who serves as a union delegate.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten most of what we asked for but there probably needs to be some compromises from both sides,\u201d said Bates as she huddled with a handful of other picketing teachers under a tent as it rained in front of her North Side school on Wednesday morning.\n\nChicago teachers had pushed for more money to ease overcrowded classrooms and add nurses, social workers and teaching aides, besides seeking a wage increase.\n\nThe union is seeking for a contract that runs three years instead of five and more paid prep-time for elementary school teachers.\n\nLightfoot said she and Chicago Public Schools Chief Executive Officer Janice Jackson met with union leadership for more than three hours on Tuesday, but both sides did not come to a resolution.\n\n\u201cWe made some movement to try to get a deal done and I was deeply disappointed that with that movement ... they would not take the deal,\u201d she said during a news conference.\n\nDistrict officials said on Tuesday they had proposed to spend $25 million to reduce overcrowding in the district and a further $70 million to hire support staff, such as nurses and social workers.\n\nLightfoot has said the district could not afford the union\u2019s full demands, estimating they would cost an extra $2.4 billion each year for an increase of more than 30% in the current school budget of $7.7 billion.", "description": "A teachers' strike in Chicago moved into the 10th school day on Wednesday, as the teachers' union and district worked to resolve a contract deadlock over class sizes, support staff levels and pay at the bargaining table.", "authors": ["Brendan O", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446561683&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T08Z", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
