Rob Shumaker, president of the zoo, said the center also aims to assist researchers with their work, including fundraising, talking to policy makers and crafting social media campaigns.\n\n\"It's no exaggeration to say that every significant conservation project in the world will be touched by the Global Center for Species Survival,\" Shumaker said in written remarks.\n\nThe center is a collaboration between the zoo and the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission, or IUCN. The zoo and IUCN signed a deal Monday to establish the center during a commission meeting in in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe IUCN , founded 70 years ago and composed of biologists who maintain a list of threatened species, is considered the world's largest and most significant environmental conservation organization.\n\nThe Species Survival Commission, known as SSC, prepares action plans to save species and provides information to IUCN that is used to develop and define the Red List, which identifies and evaluates endangered species.\n\nCEO Michael Crowther, who is retiring from the commission at the end of 2018, started working with SSC leaders two years ago to develop the concept of the center, the zoo said. The center is a natural offshoot from the Indianapolis Prize, which the zoo has awarded every other year since 2006.\n\nRuss Mittermeier, a former Indianapolis Prize winner, said the new center will cement the city as a hot spot for visiting conservationists.\n\n\"Their visions have really made Indianapolis a real center for species conservation already and now they're taking it to the next level with this incredible commitment,\" Mittermeier said.", "description": "The Indianapolis Zoo plans to open an international center devoted to saving threatened species, an effort that zoo officials call a natural extension of their biennial Indianapolis Prize honoring animal conservation leaders.
