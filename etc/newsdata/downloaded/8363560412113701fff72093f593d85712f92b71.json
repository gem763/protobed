You starting to think this is a real story or no?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d said Van Buren. \u201cEssentially, the first complaint surfaced the phone call\u2013the full transcript is available online. Anyone can read it and it\u2019s clearly not crazy or frightening, it clearly doesn\u2019t represent any kind of demand for political quid pro quo or anything along those lines.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen however is some very clever teeing up of information and kind of a three-way pitch and toss between the Democrats, the media, and what\u2019s going on with this so-called whistle-blower,\u201d continued Van Buren. \u201cThere is a second whistle-blower that we are led to believe is somehow adding to the narrative, but I think what is emerging is that the second whistle-blower is actually the source for the first whistle-blower, which means it\u2019s all the same thing.\u201d\n\nThe former State Department official pointed out that the political underhandedness the left is engaging in is familiar, yet a bit different than what we recently saw in another high-profile case of attempted political butchery.\n\n\u201cThis is different than in the Kavanaugh case where they sent Michael Avenatti out to find additional victims wherever he could,\u201d said Van Buren. \u201cIn his case, there are other lawyers who took time off from chasing ambulances to go on Twitter and play out their second whistle-blower.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in fact, he [the second Ukraine whistleblower] is simply the source for the first whistleblower. The CIA\u2013this is an old trick. It\u2019s called a feedback loop. What you do is you set up one of your sources to back up another source and you make it appear that your initial source is more credible by feeding information into the loop. That\u2019s what seems to be going on here. They are repurposing a witness as a second whistleblower.\u201d\n\nWatch the Tucker Carlson segment \u2026\n\nVideo by Fox News", "description": "Peter Van Buren said the Ukraine whistleblower flimflam is a \"three way pitch-and-toss\" by Democrats and a \"CIA trick\" that is \"called a feedback loop.\"", "authors": ["Victor Rantala", "John Hawkins", "David Limbaugh", "Larry Elder", "Michelle Malkin", "Stephen Moore", "Tucker Carlson", "Neil Patel"], "top_image": "https://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SG-Carlson-Van-Buren-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
