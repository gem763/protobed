But those with such documentation were asked to get off the Balearia after the passenger manifest was submitted to the US federal agency on Sunday night, according to some of the crew, because they said the US would not accept them.\n\nCBP fired back on Monday. Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner, said there was simply \u201cconfusion\u201d over people fleeing the Bahamas being able to come to the US.\n\n\u201cWe will accept anyone on humanitarian reasons that needs to come here,\u201d he said at a White House briefing, adding that those with serious criminal records were automatically disqualified.\n\nStephen Silvestri, the acting director for CBP at Port Everglades, told a reporter from Miami news station WSVN who was onboard the ferry: \u201cIf those folks did stay on the boat and arrived we would have processed them, vetted them and worked within our laws and protocols and done what we had to do to facilitate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was a business decision by Balearia to remove them. They were not ordered off the boat by any government entity.\u201d\n\nThe ship\u2019s owners, Balearia Caribbean, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement to WSVN on Monday afternoon, the company said it had \u201cboarded the passengers with the understanding that they could travel to the US without visas, only to later having been advised that in order to travel to Ft Lauderdale they required prior in-person authorization from the immigration authorities in Nassau.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe regret and apologize for the hardship and inconvenience experienced by the 119 passengers who are residents from Grand Bahama Island who could not be transported,\u201d the company added.\n\nMost of the passengers had spent hours at the crowded dock in Freeport on Sunday, trying to secure a seat on board the 1,000-capacity vessel.\n\nRenard Oliver, an evacuee from Grand Bahama trying to reach Florida with his two young daughters, told WSVN: \u201cThey\u2019re saying they just got a call from CBP and CBP told them that everyone that doesn\u2019t have a US visa and was travelling on a police record has to come off.\n\n\u201cAt the last minute like this it\u2019s kind of disappointing. It\u2019s hurting watching my daughters cry.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, 1,500 evacuees from Grand Bahama reached Palm Beach, Florida, aboard the Grand Celebration, a ship operated by Paradise Cruise Line. The difference, according to CBP, was that Paradise had coordinated the voyage with Bahamian government and US officials in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cCBP relies on the transportation companies \u2026 to be engaged in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of any individuals that have been devastated by this tragedy and that requires transparent communication and planning for adequate resources to receive any arrival,\u201d a CBP statement issued on Monday said.\n\nSince the category 5 hurricane tore into north-western islands of the Bahamas eight days ago, with winds gusting above 200mph and a storm surge of more than 20ft, thousands have been evacuated to Nassau or the US.\n\nMilitary transport planes flying from Abaco and Grand Bahama enhanced efforts begun by dozens of operators of private boats and aircraft in the immediate aftermath of the storm.\n\nMarco Rubio, the US senator for Florida, backed the CBP position in a Monday lunchtime tweet, claiming that it appeared Balearia \u201cdidn\u2019t coordinate in advance. And decided to leave instead of waiting a few hours to complete process.\u201d\n\nRubio toured the worst-hit islands last week with his fellow US senator Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, the former and current governors of Florida, the trio urging the Trump administration to waive or suspend certain visa requirements for Bahamian nationals to come to the US.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Morgan, the acting commissioner of CBP, said no visa documentation requirements had changed. Immigration officers at points of entry, he said, had discretion \u201cto issue humanitarian or medical parole on a case-by-case basis\u201d.", "description": "Crew said people without visas must disembark ferry to Florida because of CBP\u2019s \u2018last-minute call\u2019 that they would not be admitted", "authors": ["Richard Luscombe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24519093b5ad12a4e931c51fd1e90cf9c2b3661f/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=400becd7a49b64ee5d2c7fbb9d006e0f", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
