I\u2019d rather be dead in a ditch.\u201d\n\nAsked if that means he would sooner resign than delay, he dodged the question but criticized MPs for forcing an extension that he said would cost \"a billion pounds a month\" and achieve \"absolutely nothing.\"\n\nMPs have voted for a bill that would prevent a no-deal Brexit on October 31 by forcing Johnson to seek a Brexit extension until January 2020, in the event that no agreement is in place by October 19. The bill is set to become law early next week.\n\nJohnson's government plans to hold another vote on whether to hold an early election on Monday, after its first attempt failed on Wednesday night. Opposition parties are refusing to back Johnson and on Thursday held discussions on how to proceed. Options open to them include withholding support for a government election motion until the Brexit extension is in force, or holding a vote of no confidence in Johnson's government that could lead to an election in late October.\n\nSpeaking in front of two rows of police officers in Yorkshire, Johnson insisted he does not want an election \"at all\" but \"frankly I cannot see another way.\u201d\n\nIn an occasionally rambling speech Johnson also responded to the resignation of his brother Jo Johnson, the universities minister, who announced on Thursday he was standing down as an MP at the next election. Jo Johnson has previously expressed serious concern about a no-deal Brexit and said he had been \"torn between family loyalty and the national interest.\"\n\nAsked about his brother's decision, the prime minister said \"people disagree about the EU. But the way to unite the country is to get this thing done.\u201d\n\nThe event came to an unfortunate end after one of the police officers standing behind Johnson appeared close to fainting and had to sit down. Johnson asked whether the officer was OK, but continued answering a question before wrapping up the press conference.", "description": "PM says extension would cost \u2018a billion pounds a month\u2019 and achieve \u2018absolutely nothing.\u2019", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "Paul Dallison", "Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166063092-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
