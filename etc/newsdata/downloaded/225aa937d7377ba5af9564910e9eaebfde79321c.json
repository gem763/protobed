REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nThe 16-year-old Swede electrified the U.N. summit in New York when she denounced world leaders for failing to tackle climate change, unleashing the outrage felt by millions of her peers by demanding: \u201cHow dare you?\u201d\n\nPutin, chairing a session at an energy forum in Moscow, said: \u201cI may disappoint you but I don\u2019t share the common excitement about the speech by Greta Thunberg.\n\n\u201cNo one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different and ... people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump mocked Thunberg and Canadian Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier called her alarmist and mentally unstable. Thunberg said their mockery of children showed her message had become \u201ctoo loud to handle\u201d.\n\nPutin said young people who paid attention to environmental issues should be supported, adding: \u201cBut when someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl. But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.\u201d\n\nInspired by Thunberg\u2019s solitary weekly protest outside the Swedish parliament a year ago, millions of people have poured onto the streets around the globe to demand governments take emergency action on climate change.\n\nThunberg told the U.N. conference: \u201cThis is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?.\n\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier this week, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament, the Duma, invited Thunberg to Russia to deliver a speech.", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday took aim at teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, telling an energy forum he did not share the excitement about her United Nations speech last month.", "authors": ["Vladimir Soldatkin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436274161&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9110J"}
