I would not,\u201d Kemp told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand the anger. And I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I thought that God could forgive her and I said, \u2018Yes, God can forgive you and has,\u2019\u201d she added.\n\nIn the moments after Brandt Jean, the younger brother of Botham Jean, forgave Guyger in a now-viral moment, Kemp took time to speak to both Jean\u2019s family and Guyger. Kemp gave Guyger the Bible, saying \u201cyou just need a tiny mustard seed of faith. You start with this,\u201d before giving her a hug and continuing, \u201cyou haven\u2019t done as much as you think you have, and you can be forgiven. You did something bad in one moment in time.

Co-presidents Don Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor wrote that \u201chere, compassion crossed the line into coercion. And there can be few relationships more coercive than a sentencing judge in a criminal trial and a citizen accused and convicted of a crime.\u201d\n\nBut Kemp defended the display of religiosity during her recent interview, telling the AP that she was entirely motivated by a desire to prevent Guyger from falling into depression.\n\n\u201cIf she wanted to start with the Bible, I didn\u2019t want her to go back to the jail and to sink into doubt and self-pity and become bitter,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause she still has a lot of life ahead of her following her sentence and I would hope that she could live it purposefully.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Judge Tammy Kemp defended her decision to give ex-cop and convicted murderer Amber Guyger a hug and a bible in the moments after the conclusion of last week\u2019s trial, in her first public interview after the event.\u201cFollowing my own convictions, I could not refuse that woman a hug.
