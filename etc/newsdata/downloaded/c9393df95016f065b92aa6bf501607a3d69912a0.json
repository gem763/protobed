Fletcher told the government\u2019s lawyer, as he and the others on the three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals pondered how to fix things.\n\nAt issue is the administration\u2019s Migrant Protection Protocols, a key part of the president\u2019s attempt to stop the flow of migrants from Central America surging across Mexico en route to the U.S. with bogus asylum claims.\n\nUnder the MPP, Homeland Security is making many of them return to Mexico and wait for their court dates in U.S. immigration courts. The philosophy is twofold \u2014 if they crossed Mexico, they have no fear of that country, and making them wait outside the U.S. could discourage those without legitimate claims from attempting to make the journey.\n\nImmigrant-rights advocates say the policy, dubbed \u201cReturn to Mexico,\u201d is unfair and even dangerous for some of the migrants who have legitimate fears and for whom waiting in Mexico could be just as treacherous as being in their home countries.\n\nAt least two of the judges during oral argument in the 9th Circuit on Tuesday were sympathetic to that complaint.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving them nothing, that is to say you\u2019re not even asking them the key question \u2026 that is to say, are you afraid?\u201d Judge Fletcher prodded Scott Stewart, the deputy assistant attorney general defending the policy.\n\nMigrants who do express fear of waiting in Mexico are allowed into the U.S.\n\nMr. Stewart said the administration figures migrants will volunteer the information on their own, and there\u2019s no need to prod them with specific questions.\n\n\u201cSomeone can raise this claim at any time,\u201d he said.\n\nJudge Fletcher said it was \u201cspeculation\u201d that people would come forward on their own.\n\nBoth U.S. law and treaties the country has signed prohibit the government from sending refugees to any country where they face persecution or abuse.\n\nThe Trump administration acknowledges that restriction, but says there\u2019s a difference between permanently sending someone back to their home country they fled, and asking them to wait in a third country they just crossed through.\n\nJudy Rabinowitz, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who argued against the Trump administration Tuesday, said the government should still ask whether migrants believe they could be harmed by being returned \u2014 even temporarily \u2014 to Mexico.\n\nShe also said she wants the standards lowered so it\u2019s easier to prove fear, and she questioned the speedy nature of the government\u2019s decisions.\n\n\u201cYou have no time to prepare, you have no notice you should even be talking about your fear of return to Mexico, if you have an attorney you can\u2019t even consult with that attorney,\u201d she told the court.\n\nMexico says it did not agree to the MPP, but is still working to accommodate U.S. efforts by offering protections to the people the U.S. is shipping back across the border.\n\nA district court had blocked the MPP earlier this year but another panel of the 9th Circuit lifted that block, ruling the policy could take effect while the case was being battled.\n\nThe panel Tuesday did not issue an immediate ruling.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
