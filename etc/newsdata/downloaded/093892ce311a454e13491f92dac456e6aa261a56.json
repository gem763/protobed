They didn't expect that because we'd never played in this formation before.\"\n\nThe score did not flatter the home side, though, as they missed several chances to win by a bigger margin, having ripped into the visitors with crisp one-touch passing and darting raids down both flanks.\n\nAtalanta barely threatened and missed their best chance after the damage had already been done, as Dinamo keeper Dominik Livakovic pulled off a magnificent save to deny Duvan Zapata.\n\nElsewhere, a blunder from Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky handed Lokomotiv Moscow a 2-1 win over the German side in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\nWith the score tied at 1-1, Hradecky sent a pass straight to Lokomotiv midfielder Dmitry Barinov, who promptly scored.\n\nLokomotiv had taken the lead through Grzegorz Krychowiak in the 16th minute before Leverkusen leveled when Charles Aranguiz's shot took a deflection off Benedikt Howedes and was ruled an own goal.\n\nThe defeat is a big blow for Leverkusen, which had been widely considered more likely than Lokomotiv to challenge Juventus and Atletico Madrid for the qualifying places in Group D.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
