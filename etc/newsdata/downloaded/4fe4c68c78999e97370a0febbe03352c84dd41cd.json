The average of those attributes contributed to their final ranking.\n\nMany of America\u2019s fastest-growing jobs, such as personal-care aides and fast-food workers, pay the lowest wages in the nation, while the highest-compensated professions, like doctors and lawyers, have few openings a year. Registered nurses and software developers hit the sweet spot, pairing relatively high wages with robust demand\u2014making them among the most promising careers in our analysis.\n\nSearch our interactive for more than 800 jobs with information on their rankings, median pay, projected employment changes and growth rates, and typical education needed.\n\nBest Jobs Select an occupation in the dropdown for employment projections and median salaries.
