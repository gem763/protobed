In addition, they will show off their five-month-old son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, who has not yet officially been seen in public.\n\nPRINCE HARRY RECEIVES AN APOLOGY FROM BBC FOR PUBLISHING \u2018RACE TRAITOR\u2019 IMAGE THAT DEPICTED HIS ASSASSINATION\n\n\u201cAfter a summer of scathing headlines about their private jet use, the Sussexes will fly commercial for their first long haul flight with baby Archie,\u201d explained Nicholl. \u201cAnd the expectations will be high once they get there. Their tour last fall to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga was a rousing success, but also came just months after their wedding and immediately after Meghan had announced her pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were welcomed with open arms, their baby news celebrated at every engagement they attended and any talk of republicanism seemed to disappear the moment they touched down in Sydney,\u201d Nicholl continued. \u201cWhen they returned home the Queen is understood to have written to them to congratulate them on a tour well done.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nicholl shared that this year\u2019s royal tour is different and comes with high expectations from the couple. Sources close to the couple told Nicholl that Harry, 35, and Markle, 38, are aware that there is no room for error that can result in bad publicity.\n\n\u201cThis year, their trip comes after not only the private jet drama but what was perceived as a family snub when the Sussexes decided not to visit the Queen at Balmoral, even as Meghan flew to New York for the U.S. Open a week later,\u201d said Nicholl. \u201cThe couple has hired an American PR firm to help with damage control, and sources say they hope the upcoming trip will help turn the tide.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE WILLIAM WISH PRINCE HARRY A HAPPY BIRTHDAY WITH SWEET MESSAGES\n\nIngrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, told Nicholl Archie will play a crucial role in making this tour a success.\n\n\u201cPeople will want to see baby Archie who could be the key player in this,\u201d said Seward. I think if they show a glimpse of Archie it could turn things around for the Sussexes.\n\nSeward pointed out that royal babies have been essential in promoting positive press. When Prince Charles and then-wife Princess Diana took an infant Prince William to New Zealand, his crawling in Auckland immediately made international headlines. William\u2019s firstborn Prince George was also highly praised following his visit to Australia and New Zealand in 2014 when he was less than a year old.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small thing but it could end up being a very big thing in terms of better press coverage,\u201d Seward admitting. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a tough run, this is a chance to make it better.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE ENDS MATERNITY LEAVE TO PROMOTE NEW CHARITY FASHION LINE\n\nNicholl shared Harry and Markle have appointed an all-female staff who will be joining them in Africa. Their new private secretary Fiona Mcilwham will also learn \u201cthe ins and outs of a royal tour\u201d from Samantha Cohen, who has been at the palace for over 15 years and used to work for Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nOne source said the couple feels confident Cohen will ensure everything goes smoothly during the trip. It is also believed this is Cohen\u2019s last job before she leaves the royal household.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d said Seward. \u201cWhen you look at all the bad press they\u2019ve had, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019ve got to claw back some of the goodwill that made them so popular around the royal wedding and which has diminished ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think part of the problem is that they have been trying to do things their way when what they\u2019re expected to be doing is their duty,\u201d continued Seward. \u201cThey did really well in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, and now they have another chance to show they can be great ambassadors for the Queen and country.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY ARE 'PUBLIC RELATIONS DISASTER' FOR ROYALS: REPORT\n\nAccording to Nicholl, there won\u2019t be a traditional welcome at the airport when the family and their entourage arrive on Monday because the South African president is not there to greet the couple. Instead, they will go straight to work and head to Cape Town to view a workshop that teaches children self-defense classes and female empowerment training. Both Harry and Markle are expected to speak at the event and give speeches they wrote themselves.\n\nThe couple will also tackle five engagements a day. After Harry leaves Cape Town for Botswana, Angola and Malawi, Markle will stay behind with Archie to tackle her own royal duties. However, many of her meetings will be private to avoid overshadowing Harry\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWhile on his own Harry will visit his charity Sentebale\u2019s new project in Kasane, Botswana, which works with young people affected with HIV,\u201d said Nicholl. \u201cIn Angola, he will visit the landmine site his mother famously visited in 1997 with the Halo Trust; the images of him visiting the very street his mother saw when it was a dangerous minefield, now a thriving town, is expected to be some of the most poignant of the tour.\n\n\u201cAnd in Malawi, Harry will visit a girls\u2019 educational center and dedicate Liwonde National Park to the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Canopy. He\u2019ll then reunite with Meghan in Johannesburg where they will carry out more engagements before the end of the tour.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY BRINGING BABY ARCHIE ON 10-DAY AFRICA TRIP\n\nEarlier this month, Harry broke his silence about his and Markle\u2019s use of private jets despite their negative impact on the environment following a flood of backlash.\n\n\"I spend 99 percent of my life traveling the world by commercial [flights],\" said Harry during a speech in Amsterdam to promote Travalyst, a new travel sustainability initiative.\n\n\"Occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family [is] safe.\"\n\n\u201cWe can all do better and while no one is perfect, we all have a responsibility for our own individual impact,\u201d he also said, according to People. \u201cThe question is what we do to balance it out.\u201d\n\nPIERS MORGAN: MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY ARE HYPOCRITES FOR PRIVATE JETS, PREACHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe couple drew criticism this summer when they took a private jet to go on vacation to Ibiza, then to Nice, France, despite the flight's carbon impact on the planet.\n\nThey reportedly flew from Farnborough, U.K., to Ibiza, Spain, on Aug. 6, then back on Aug. 12.\n\nOn Aug. 14, they flew from Farnborough to Nice, France, to visit pal Elton John, then back to Farnborough on Aug. 17.\n\nThe couple is believed to have taken a Gulfstream 200, which seats 19 people, to Ibiza from Farnborough, and a Cessna 500 XL, which seats nine, on their return trip.\n\nKATE MIDDLETON, PRINCE WILLIAM FLY COMMERCIAL AFTER MEGHAN MARKLE-PRINCE HARRY PRIVATE JET CONTROVERSY\n\nTheir trip to Nice was to spend time at John's home.\n\nThe singer, 72, later said in a statement that he provided the flight for the Sussexes to preserve their safety and privacy.\n\nFox News\u2019 Jessica Sager contributed to this report.", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s upcoming royal tour in Africa beginning this Monday will be their attempt to overcome their bad publicity, one royal expert is claiming.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/06/694940094001_6084101428001_6084096213001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
