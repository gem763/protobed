It will be implemented through a government decree.\n\nThe Treasury forecast in December that the web tax would yield 600 million euros in revenues from 2020.\n\nGualtieri also said Italy had just asked the European Commission to present a proposal on minimum taxation for companies across Europe.\n\nEU Economic Affairs Commissioner-designate Paolo Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister, has said he plans to oversee EU efforts to harmonize corporate taxes across the 28-nation bloc.\n\nHe has also said the EU will introduce a tax on digital services even in the absence of a global accord on a web tax.", "description": "Italy will implement a planned \"web tax\" in 2020, obliging big digital companies to pay a 3% levy on some Internet transactions, Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438498135&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9719I", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
