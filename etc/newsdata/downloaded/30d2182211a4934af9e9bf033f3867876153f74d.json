USB charging also means you can get a sneaky top up at your desk before your commute home.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the term lumens cropping up again and again in our tests \u2013 it\u2019s a measure of output, with one lumen being about the same as a full moon on a clear night.\n\nIt's estimated you ned at least 100 lumens to be seen in daylight and more than 600 to light your way home on an unlit road at night.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

They are thinner and lighter, at less than 60g each, yet offer massively increased output \u2013 400 lumens at the front and 300 at the rear (the old ones were 150 at the front, 125 rear). The designers have gone for two different types of LED. There\u2019s a COB (chip on board) version offering a more diffuse output \u2013 giving 270-degree visibility \u2013 plus a single, super-bright Cree light that grabs the attention from up to 3km away.\n\nThey fix to your bike via a little plastic mount held in place by O-rings. It looks flimsy but there\u2019s a video on the See.Sense website showing the lights staying put on a bike dropped from a second-storey balcony. Clever tech means the lights sense dangerous moments on your ride and change their flash patterns to make you more visible. As if by magic, they can work out when you are braking for junctions or filtering into traffic.\n\nThere\u2019s also a phone app to unlock extra features such as theft warnings and to trigger alerts to warn a contact if you crash. You can also tailor the flash patterns to suit your preferences. See.Sense promise up to 16 hours of use depending on your chosen flash pattern.\n\nBuy now\n\nProviz LED 360 biek light set: \u00a359.99, Proviz\n\nProviz is the king of reflective cycling gear and now it's making lights too. This sleek-looking set offers USB charging and water resistance. Both units use quality LEDs made by Cree plus Samsung batteries. There\u2019s 300 lumens output at the front and 220-degree wide angle coverage at the back to make you that bit more visible from the sides. The front light clips into a plastic mount that\u2019s held in place by a quick release lever, while the rear uses a simple O-ring. Run-time at the front ranges from six hours on full power to up to 13 on a flashing \u201cSOS\u201d setting. At the rear you\u2019ll get 3.5 hours on full or up to 6.5 on flashing.\n\nBuy now\n\nFWE rechargeable bike light set 300/30 lumen: \u00a335, Evans Cycles\n\nIf you need a budget set for occasional use or to get you home in an emergency, these should fit the bill. Both lights have rugged alloy bodies, USB charging and are secured by O-rings. The front unit can be clipped out of its mount making it handy to use as a torch too.\n\nOutput is up to an impressive 300 lumens at the front and 30 at the rear, with run times of up to 12 hours in flashing mode.\n\nA quick double click turns them on and you can check the amount of charge left in the front light by holding the power button down for a few seconds. Our only criticism is that the front light slides out of its mount quite easily if you knock it, so clumsier commuters might want to wrap a rubber band around it for extra security.\n\nBuy now\n\nKnog mid cobber bike light : \u00a349.99, Wiggle\n\nThis rear light is brilliant in more ways than one. As well as packing a 270 lumens punch in flashing mode, the clever semi-wraparound design gives it a 330-degree viewing angle. That means you\u2019ll be much more visible to drivers sideways at junctions and roundabouts. It will run for up to 60 hours in flashing mode or two at a steady 130 lumens output. The light attaches to a magnetic mount that\u2019s secured to your seatpost via an O-ring, and you can head online to the Knog website to customise the flash patterns to your own taste.\n\nBuy now\n\nBrightside bike light: \u00a322.99, Halfords\n\nCrossing junctions at night or in low light fills us with dread \u2013 after all, 70 per cent of accidents happen at intersections and roundabouts. But this clever light should catch the eye of any driver. It fits sideways on to your frame and flashes an amber warning for up to 20 hours on a single charge, with both day and night-time settings. You can top up the charge at your desk thanks to a USB port, and at \u00a322.99 we reckon it\u2019s a bit of a bargain.\n\nBuy now\n\nBeryl laserlight core bike light: \u00a369.99, Beryl\n\nProject and survive is the idea behind this clever gadget. It beams a bright green laser image of a bike onto the road just ahead of you, warning drivers you\u2019re there. It\u2019s a great night-time safety feature, especially if you find yourself stuck in a vehicle\u2019s blind spot. You can set it to steady or flashing mode at the click of a button.\n\nThere\u2019s an additional white light with up to 400 lumens of output \u2013 again with flashing and steady settings \u2013 to light your way home in the dark or catch motorists\u2019 eyes in daylight. Beryl claims you can run it for up to 41 hours on the lowest output setting and it\u2019s got a two-year warranty.\n\nBuy now\n\nBeryl burner brake bike light: \u00a339.99, Beryl\n\nWe loved this clever 200 lumens alternative to a standard rear light. It can sense when you are braking and flashes brighter to warn any traffic around you. We tested it with our riding buddies and found it worked really well. It attaches to your bike via a silicone mount that will fit fancy aero seat post as well as standard round ones. Holding the central button turns the light on and off, while another press allows you to click through all five lighting modes. Charging is via USB and is lightning fast \u2013 it will hit full load in a 90 minutes and run for up to 17 hours.\n\nBuy now\n\nBikeHut 1600 lumen front bike light: \u00a350, Halfords\n\nA beast from Halfords\u2019 own brand BikeHut, this one uses three quality Cree-made LEDs and a trio of lithium-ion batteries to pack an unbelievable 1600 lumens punch. It\u2019s seriously bright, meaning you can ride down dark lanes at night in safety. There\u2019s a power indicator to tell you how much running time you have left and it can double up as a power bank if you need to charge gadgets while on an adventure. It comes with an out front mount that will hold a Garmin bike computer too, saving space on your handlebars. But if you don\u2019t ride with a computer you can just use the standard rubber strap mount that\u2019s included in the box.\n\nBuy now\n\nLezyne stripdrive 150 bike lights: \u00a321.78, Halfords\n\nThis tough cookie is rugged enough to stand up to the rigours of the daily commute. It\u2019s water resistant and the USB port is protected by a sturdy rubber cap to keep out the weather. Five LEDs provide up to 150 lumens of output and it will charge from empty in two hours. It\u2019s got 11 different modes including flashing and daytime ones, so you\u2019ll certainly be able to find the perfect setting for your ride.\n\nBuy now\n\nExposure traceR daybright bike light: \u00a345, Evans Cycles\n\nThe traceR might be tiny but its output is eye-catching and it\u2019s ideal for commuting and road riding. The aluminium body is not much bigger than your thumb and sits neatly on your seat post in a strap-on plastic mount. You can choose between three different intensities up to a maximum 75 lumens, and each has a steady and flashing mode. The lowest intensity flash will give you up to 24 hours of running time on a full battery. When you switch it off, the light gives a green or red indicator to let you know if you needs a top up. The USB port is protected by a band which is quite fiddly to remove, but the overall build quality is superb.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Bike lights\n\nSee.Sense are a great buy for both commuters and racers who want some extra protection while putting in the training miles. You\u2019ll find the quirky Beryl laserlight core makes a great talking point among your fellow commuters, but if you need extra illumination at a great price take a look at the mighty 1600 lumens offering from BikeHut.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
