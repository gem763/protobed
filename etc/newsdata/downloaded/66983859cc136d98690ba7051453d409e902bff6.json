The rest of the field are polling in single figures.\n\nThe legacy of President Obama came up repeatedly, while there were also questions on immigration, climate change and gun control. But it was healthcare which sparked the fieriest clashes.\n\nWhy is healthcare controversial?\n\nThe issue of how to reform the US healthcare system has divided moderate and more progressive Democrats.\n\nMr Sanders and Ms Warren both back Medicare for All, which would expand an existing federally run programme for the elderly to cover all Americans in a single-payer insurance system.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders (left), Former US Vice-President Joe Biden (centre) and Elizabeth Warren\n\nMr Biden criticised Mr Sanders' Medicare for All plan as being too expensive to work and said the country should focus on improving President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act instead.\n\n\"I know the senator [Warren] says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack. I think Obamacare worked,\" Mr Biden said. \"My plan costs a lot of money...but it doesn't cost $30tn (\u00a324tn).\"\n\nMs Warren defended the policy, saying families have to deal with exorbitant healthcare bills now, and only wealthier individuals and corporations would see increased costs from the plan.\n\nSome of the lower polling candidates also attacked Mr Sanders and Ms Warren, with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar saying of Medicare for All: \"I don't think that's a bold idea. It's a bad idea.\"\n\nHow about gun control?\n\nFormer Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, whose hometown El Paso was the site of a mass shooting that left 20 dead, was asked whether he supports confiscating assault-style rifles.\n\n\"Hell yes we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" Mr O'Rourke said to applause. \"We're not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore.\"\n\nCalifornia Senator Kamala Harris drew President Trump into the debate, saying: \"Obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.\"\n\nIn their opening remarks most of the candidates attacked President Trump, blasting him for being a divisive leader and accusing him of racism.\n\nWhat else happened?\n\nThough some sparks flew there was also a lot of common ground between the candidates.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Andrew Yang's debate surprise - a $120,000 giveaway to random families\n\nHere are some of the other memorable moments:\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang used his opening speech to announce he would be using donations to his campaign to start a \"freedom dividend\", giving $1,000 (\u00a3810) a month to 10 American families, prompting laughter from other candidates\n\nNew Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who is a vegan, was asked by a Spanish-speaking moderator whether he wanted Americans to stop eating meat to combat climate change. He replied: \"First of all, I want to say, no. Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish: No.\"\n\nMr Biden gave a rambling answer about combating the legacy of slavery by getting into education, talking about keeping a \"record player on at night [to] make sure that kids hear words\"\n\nHousing secretary under President Obama Juli\u00e1n Castro responded to South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg's criticism that debate fighting was \"unwatchable\" by saying: \"That's called an election\"\n\nMr Castro also took on Mr Biden, accusing him of \"forgetting what you said two minutes ago\" in an exchange on healthcare\n\nImmigration rights protesters entered the hall at one point, interrupting Mr Biden as he responded to a question on resilience by talking about coping with the loss of his first wife and children\n\nMr Buttigieg, the first openly gay presidential candidate, spoke about coming out in his final remarks, saying: \"I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer.\"\n\nUnlike the two previous debates, Thursday's event took place over one night as only 10 candidates fulfilled the stricter polling and donor requirements. Ten others remain in the race, and four have dropped out.\n\nPresident Trump said he had no plans to watch the debate but would catch a re-run. He said that Mr Biden was most likely to win if he avoided any \"major mistakes\".\n\nWho will take on Trump?\n\nChoose your candidate and filter by category", "description": "Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders share the stage for the first time in a testy debate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07n6swb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
