But that\u2019s not something we\u2019re able to confirm.\u2019\n\nThe season five finale aired back in May after a two-year gap between series and since then fans have been eager to find out exactly when season six will be hitting our screens.\n\nBut if we are set to get a new series in 2020, it may be later in the year as opposed to earlier, as Jed admitted that the production is still at the \u2018planning stage\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018That\u2019s something that we have at the planning stage, so we are working towards a date. We can\u2019t confirm everything until things are in place.\u2019\n\nVicky McClure stars as Kate Fleming in Line Of Duty (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe series follows AC-12\u2019s Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), DI Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) and DS Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) as they investigate corrupt police officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s not too much info yet on exactly what to expect from the next series of the show, but Jed did drop a pretty huge potential clue on Twitter earlier this year as he hinted that series six would feature a crossover of the first and second series.\n\nRe-posting a photo of Lenny James and Keely Hawes, who played Tony Gates and Lindsay Denton on the show, he commented: \u2018Looking forward to seeing you meet in Series 6.\u2019\n\nJed is currently discussing the future of his other hit show Bodyguard (Picture: BBC)\n\nBut bringing them back might be tricky as both characters \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 have been killed off.\n\nJed \u2013 who also created Bodyguard for the BBC \u2013 revealed earlier this year that he was in talks with the broadcaster about the future of both his shows.\n\nHe previously said: \u2018We\u2019re currently in talks with the BBC about the future of both series. So at this point it\u2019s not possible to say what will happen next.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s impossible to work on the two of them simultaneously, so it would have to be sequential.\u2019\n\nHe has made it clear he would love Line of Duty to return for a seventh series after a sixth was already commissioned.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
