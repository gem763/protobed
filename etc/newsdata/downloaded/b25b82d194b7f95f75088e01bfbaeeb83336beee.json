Tonight\u2019s statement from Commissioner Silver is an absolute joke,\u201d Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott tweeted, referring to Adam Silver. \u201cThe NBA is kowtowing to Beijing to protect their bottom line and disavowing those with the temerity to #standwithHongKong .

Ted Cruz defended the GM of his home state team: \u201cAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong. Now, in pursuit of big $$, the @nba is shamefully retreating.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, including former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and California Rep. Eric Swalwell, chimed in.\n\n\u201cChina is using its economic power to silence critics \u2014 even those in the U.S.,\u201d Castro wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d\n\nChina is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government. https://t.co/87U4jgsAAp \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 7, 2019\n\nTexas Republican Sen.

The Rockets have strong support in China: Hall of Famer Yao Ming \u2014 now the chair of the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 is a former player, and a recent digital study found the Rockets were the second most popular NBA team in China, behind the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe GM tweeted Sunday that he had \u201ca lot of opportunity\u201d to hear other perspectives since posting the photo and that his views were his own.\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,\u201d Morey wrote.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/90/5a/951760cb41daa3ec94d35db03136/webp.net-resizeimage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
