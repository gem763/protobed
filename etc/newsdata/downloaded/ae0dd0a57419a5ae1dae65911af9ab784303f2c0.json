He could still secure approval for his deal, perhaps without having to make use of the Brexit extension beyond Oct. 31, which Johnson was forced to request Saturday. After more than three years of uncertainty, there might be a tight majority for his agreement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn case his deal is approved, Johnson is likely to celebrate himself as the man who got \u201cBrexit done\u201d \u2014 a phrase he has frequently used in the past. But in reality, the United Kingdom\u2019s Brexit woes are here to stay. Many of the Brexit concerns that have been on Britons\u2019 minds in recent years \u2014 a breakup of the United Kingdom or the possibility of severe economic ramifications, for instance \u2014 would remain a risk, even if Johnson\u2019s deal is approved.\n\nNorthern Ireland is expected to remain at the center of the Brexit debate one way or another. So far, concerns have mostly focused on a \u201cno deal\u201d outcome, which would trigger the introduction of border controls and could disrupt the Good Friday Agreement. That agreement ushered in a more peaceful era for Northern Ireland in the late 1990s, after a bloody conflict between Nationalists, who favored unifying with the Republic of Ireland, and Unionists, who backed remaining part of the United Kingdom.\n\nJohnson\u2019s proposed deal would avoid the reintroduction of border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but only because it would, in practice, move the customs border into the Irish Sea, which separates the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. Even though Northern Ireland would leave the E.U. customs union with the rest of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland would \u2014 at least initially \u2014 in some aspects remain aligned with the European Union.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s a major headache for Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has so far backed the Conservative Party in Parliament but won\u2019t support Johnson\u2019s deal. The party fears that his plans would drive Great Britain and Northern Ireland apart and could lead to Northern Ireland eventually unifying with the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\u201cParadoxically Mr. Johnson and Brexit may have done more for a united Ireland than the [Irish Republican Army] ever did,\u201d Jonathan Powell, a former adviser to prime minister and Labour party leader Tony Blair, wrote in the Financial Times over the weekend. Poll numbers indicate that support for unification is on the rise in Northern Ireland.\n\nThose advocating a break with the United Kingdom could see a similar rise in support in Scotland, where First Minister and Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has been rallying support for a second independence referendum. Five years ago, Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom, but \u2014 like Northern Irish voters \u2014 Scots predominantly backed remaining in the E.U. in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast week, Sturgeon reiterated that \u201cit is clearer than ever that the best future for Scotland is one as an equal, independent European nation.\"\n\nScotland\u2019s competitive disadvantage from the \u2018deal\u2019 in a nutshell - ergo, I\u2019d suggest it\u2019s not very good for the Union at all. #indyref2 https://t.co/F55WJ812tU \u2014 Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) October 18, 2019\n\nThere is no indication that the approval of a Brexit deal would hurt Johnson\u2019s critics in Northern Ireland and Scotland. In fact, the opposite might be true. If Parliament passes his deal, the basics of the United Kingdom\u2019s current relationship with the E.U. would remain unchanged until at least the end of next year, giving negotiators time to prepare a potential free-trade deal and settle other aspects related to future E.U.-British ties.\n\nBut pro-E.U. MPs worry that hard-line Brexiteers may be hoping to derail those trade talks, in which case Britain could crash out of the current arrangements. In some ways, the economic ramifications of that would be similar to a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario and could result in a plummeting GDP.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIronically, all of this \u2014 including Johnson\u2019s deal itself \u2014 would constitute a more radical break with the E.U. than even some Brexiteers proposed back in 2016.\n\nSince 2016, however, the British electorate appears to have moved in the exact opposite direction. Whereas few \u201cleave\u201d or \u201cremain\u201d voters appear to have changed their minds on Brexit, polls have still started to show a consistent preference for remaining in the E.U. for at least a year.\n\nPollsters argue that the growing support for remaining in the E.U. is mostly due to demographic change, The Post\u2019s Karla Adam writes. Some older voters \u2014 who tend to be more supportive of Brexit \u2014 have died. Meanwhile, younger Britons who have reached the voting age since 2016 are predominantly in favor of staying in the European Union.\n\nAD\n\nAs the idea of a confirmatory referendum on Johnson\u2019s deal appears to be gaining momentum among the opposition Labour Party, there is a theoretical chance that British voters\u2019 increasingly pro-remain attitude could still derail Johnson\u2019s plans, even if Parliament passes the deal. The emphasis here, of course, should be on \u201ctheoretical.\u201d\n\nBrexit has consistently proved to be unpredictable. After more than three years, there does appear to be one certainty, however: Whatever happens, Brexit won\u2019t just be \u201cdone,\u201d as Johnson is suggesting.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
