Although the four-month-old son of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, was seen arriving with the royal couple when they landed in Cape Town, he was missing in action as his parents carried out public engagements throughout the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Duke of Sussex gave a brief but understandable reason for the infant's absence while speaking to well-wishers today. \"He's sleeping,\" he told 81-year-old Somaya Ebrahim, who greeted the royal couple during their visit, per People.\n\n\"He's not grouchy, just exhausted,\" Harry explained to another fan today, saying that the flight from the U.K. to South Africa left his son feeling tired.\n\nDespite the long journey, little Archie stayed entertained on the flight by checking out the views. He was \"staring out the window\" looking at Cape Town's local landmark Table Mountain, Harry revealed, according to royal correspondent Emily Andrews.\n\nHarry tells Cape Town locals that Archie was very impressed with local landmark Table Mountain! \u201cHe was staring out the window as we flew in... looking at Table Mountain\" #Archie #RoyalTourAfrica #sussexroyaltour pic.twitter.com/FzeD4Ul81M \u2014 Emily Andrews (@byEmilyAndrews) September 23, 2019\n\nAlthough Archie sat out of today's engagements, he was still acknowledged at the events. His parents received a tiny T-shirt on his behalf that read \"Be a Voice for Justice,\" and he was given a traditional South African Xhosa name, Ntsika, chosen by the local township grandmothers.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Karwai Tang - Getty Images More\n\nIt's unclear when we'll finally see Archie out for an appearance on the royal tour. A source told People that the duke and duchess are hoping to include him in the program, but it's \"difficult to schedule\" due to his young age. Regardless, we're keeping our fingers crossed for an Archie cameo soon.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The four-month-old traveled with his parents, but he wasn't around for the public engagements.", "authors": ["Erica Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eHDEG5QskSQo7Ky2VT3XmQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MjE1NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/dd3572ed6aa4d18ee595a1bcafd6cf07", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
