In the autumn, willow trees sweep their branches in the water, and the place gives the impression of a lazy, golden city from the last imperial days.\n\nGulou, often called the heart of old Beijing, is one of the only areas left that still have the city\u2019s ancient winding alleyways, or hutongs. Yang and his mother live in Yu\u2019er hutong, which lies just off the well-known and tourist-packed Nanluogu Xiang pedestrian street and is a short stroll from the ancient Drum and Bell Towers once used to tell the time across the city.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Yu (or Jade) River was restored in 2014. Much of the real estate immediately surrounding it has already been developed into highly-priced recreational spaces.

In the months leading up to the 2008 Olympics, the historic Qianmen/Dashilar neighbourhoods to the south of the Forbidden City palace were demolished and rebuilt into a shiny shopping area. Dashilar remains popular with visitors but is largely mourned by locals for its \u201csoulless, modern replicas\u201d of old Beijing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A restaurant shut down as part of the \u201cGreat Brickening\u201d \u2013 in which businesses were forced to shut storefronts were bricked up.

In 2010 the area was designated to be completely demolished to make way for Beijing Time Cultural City \u2013 an underground museum and shopping complex. The plan faced a severe backlash, from the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center among others, and was put on hold indefinitely by city authorities.\n\nThe areas around Yu\u2019er already suffer from what is colloquially known as the \u201cGreat Brickening\u201d \u2013 in which businesses in the hutongs are forced to shut down awaiting development and storefronts are bricked up.\n\nThe Four Hutongs project is different. It is not a large-scale demolition and transformation like the 2010 proposal, and in contrast to the Great Brickening, it concerns residential rather than commercial properties.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In the months leading up to the 2008 Olympics, the historic Qianmen/Dashilar neighbourhoods were demolished and rebuilt as a shopping area.

Although the four hutongs won\u2019t be replaced by modern shopping malls or concrete high-rises, the renovated homes can be turned into recreational spaces, private clubs or expensive courtyard houses.\n\n\u2018The city is still growing\u2019\n\nMany longtime residents wonder what this gentrification means for them.\n\nZhou, who is in his late 60s, grew up in Yu\u2019er hutong with his parents and six siblings in a one-room house with a lean-to kitchen. In 1969, as a teenager, he was sent to live in Jilin province under Mao Zedong\u2019s \u201cre-education\u201d programme. He didn\u2019t make it back to Beijing until the 1990s. \u201cSo much of what wasn\u2019t city is now city, and it\u2019s still growing,\u201d he says, shaking his head in disbelief.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hutongs off Nanluogu Xiang in 2016.

Unlike Yang\u2019s side of the hutong, Zhou\u2019s area isn\u2019t being completely torn down \u2013 instead, he and his neighbours will be offered the choice to move back in after renovations.\n\nOthers are being offered apartments in high-rise superblocks on the outer edges of the city or monetary compensation in proportion to the square footage of their current homes.\n\nMore than 400 of 662 households have registered to move out, many happy enough with a move to higher-quality housing that would otherwise not be possible given Beijing\u2019s inflated real estate prices.\n\nBut some are intimidated. Changing lifestyles so late in life is daunting for elderly people who have lived in one-storey houses their whole lives, they say, and they would miss the intimate communal feel of the hutongs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zhou with his dog, Coconut, outside his house. Photograph: Lavinia Liang\n\nAs demolitions start around them, others find they can\u2019t move out even if they want to. Yang fears his mother\u2019s condition is too fragile. Zhou, due to his time away from Beijing, has a bureaucratic hurdle: the house is not in his name because his family formalised the document when he was in Jilin.\n\nZhou lights a cigarette and leans back in his chair. Just outside the door is his family\u2019s aged dingxiang tree. He recalls how his parents used to yell at his friends if any of them picked the fragrant white flowers.\n\nChina's radical plan to limit the populations of Beijing and Shanghai Read more\n\n\u201cHalf of it\u2019s dead,\u201d he says, pointing out a cluster of gnarled, empty branches. \u201cBut that part\u201d \u2013 he points to the other half, which holds a number of blossoms \u2013 \u201cthat half is still alive.\u201d For now, at least.\n\nLavinia Liang\u2019s family have lived just off Nanluogu Xiang for more than 50 years.
