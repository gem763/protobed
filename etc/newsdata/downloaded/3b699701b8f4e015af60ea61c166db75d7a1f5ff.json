However, human decisions are often based on noisy data and flawed judgments,\" Pomona researchers Naomi Baer, Erica Barry and Gary Smith wrote.\n\nSome of the other stocks used in the study included Papa John's (PZZA), Boingo Wireless (WIFI), Thermogenesis Corp. (KOOL), Mammoth Energy Services (TUSK) and Dentsply Sirona (XRAY).\n\n\"If a ticker is easy to pronounce or clever, it is likely that the symbol invokes a sense of creativity and positivity when an investor reads or hears about it,\" the researchers said. \"This positive feeling \u2014 albeit completely unrelated to the success or relevant financial characteristics of the company \u2014 may then be implicitly associated with the stock when the investor recalls details about it.\"\n\nThe analysis follows work done in a 2009 paper that tested the same theory from 1984-2005 and found similar results.\n\nStudies since then have shown that stocks with easier-to-read ticker symbols have greater liquidity and trading volume, though the results of the broader research haven't been reproduced. The Pomona research also found that the outperformance of the clever-ticker stocks wasn't due to a few stars that carried the day, as 19 of the 22 companies in the basket did better than the broader market.", "description": "Choosing stocks with cute tickers like those has proven to be a profitable strategy over the previous 12 years.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101377369-papa_johns.jpg?v=1391096304"}
