You can grab your tickets to the shows right here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to welcoming this talented group of Australian comedians to the Prime Video Family,\u201d James Farrell, Head of International Originals for Amazon Studios said. \u201cThese are hilarious performances that we know our customers will love in Australia and around the world.\u201d\n\nJust last month, Amazon Prime announced its first Aussie Amazon Original series set to be hosted by Rebel Wilson. It\u2019s called LOL: Last One Laughing. Yes. In a nutshell you have ten leading Aussie comedians battling it out to make each other laugh first. The winner cops a cool $100,000.\n\nAlso, Wilson is randomly going to host Seven\u2019s new competition dog styling show Pooched Perfect. This will also premiere next year. I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s about dogs so I\u2019ll probably tune in for an episode or two.", "description": "Amazon Prime Video has locked in 10 Aussie comedians - exactly who you'd expect - for ten worldwide specials slated for release next year.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Tom-Gleeson.png"}
