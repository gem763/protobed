But while the strength world clearly has problems, it\u2019s also changing in positive ways that might not be immediately visible to outsiders who just see a bunch of jacked people doing seemingly impossible things. The shock value of Bob Paris coming out as gay is a vestige of a different time; strength athletes now constitute a wide spectrum of gender and sexual identities. In that respect, powerlifting and strongman and other strength fields have begun to reflect the broadening cultural embrace of diversity. Followers of these fields are getting new exposure to people who challenge restrictive norms.\n\nAs a journalist covering these areas, I\u2019ve experienced that positive impact firsthand. When I interviewed the transgender powerlifter Janae Kroc in 2017, I heard a narrative related to Paris\u2019s: After quickly rising to the top of powerlifting, Kroc decided that setting world records was a secondary consideration next to expressing an evolving gender identity. But unlike Paris, whose immediate impact on the strength world would likely have been dulled by the less welcoming climate for LGBTQ folks in the 1990s, Kroc broadcast a powerful message on social media and in a documentary that streamed on Netflix.\n\nRob Kearney, who is gay and a contender for World\u2019s Strongest Man, has told me he hopes his hard work will make other LGBTQ people feel comfortable pursuing their own strength goals. By being open about his identity, Kearney believes he can help transform gyms into safer places for people looking to re-create themselves outside the trappings of conventional masculinity.\n\nLiefia Ingalls, too, has divorced strength from its staling masculine connotations. She is, quite literally, the strongest woman in the world. Her strength was hard-won over the course of a decade in a way that certain kinds of male strength never could be. She says that being strong is about being \u201ccapable and athletic,\u201d and she has no reservations about getting as jacked as possible. \u201cWithin myself and when I am within the strength community, I always feel strong and capable now,\u201d she told me.\n\nIngalls still has to struggle against stigma and shame, but perhaps surprisingly, she says those things mostly come from outside the strength world. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out in public, I have had mixed experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cI have definitely been \u2018fit-shamed\u2019 before, and I tend to feel looked down upon by women in other settings. The more we stand out from the norm, the more we receive unsolicited comments on our bodies and appearance.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve been exposed to all these perspectives, I\u2019ve been able to reconsider my own sense of relative weakness. Growing up, I simply saw strength as the absence of vulnerability: I took it for granted that I needed to be big, because if I wasn\u2019t, I would embarrass myself at sports and disappoint my father and get beaten up. But the strength community, for all its lingering baggage, has challenged such a limited outlook. After all my conversations with people who have broken the mold of what it means to be jacked, I\u2019m more attuned to how strength has enriched other aspects of my identity.", "description": "Getting ripped comes with cultural baggage.", "authors": ["Oliver Bateman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_81825952/facebook.jpg?1568995868", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
