Tyson will be joined on \u201cFight Game\u201d by co-host Sean O\u2019Connell, PFL ESPN play-by-play announcer and PFL 2018 light heavyweight champion.\n\n\u201cWe can take this to another dimension,\u201d Tyson told The Associated Press. \u201cWe can brand it the proper way. Give it the proper advertisement. We can take these fighters and publicize these fighters properly. We can take all the fighters from all over the planet, and all the techniques and all the disciplines and put them in one tournament and find out who really is the baddest (fighter) on the planet that ever lived.\u201d\n\nThe PFL is a tournament-based organization that kicks off the playoffs this week. PFL playoffs are held over three nights in October: Friday\u2019s fights are headlined by women\u2019s 155 pounds and welterweights; Oct. 17 features featherweights and lightweights; and Oct. 31 has light heavyweights and heavyweights. Each male fighter must fight twice and win twice that night to advance to the championship finals.\n\nTyson can add TV host to an entertainment tableau highlighted by a scene-stealing stint in \u201cThe Hangover .\u201d He voiced himself in an animated show on the Cartoon Network and even starred in a one-man show on Broadway . He hosted a podcast and founded his own cannabis company.\n\nTyson has long been ant uncensored, unfiltered athlete who has unloaded quotes like this one on Evander Holyfield (whom he bit twice during their infamous 1997 fight): \u201cI want your heart! I want to eat his children!\u201d Or this one on his own persona: \u201cI comes across as crass, a Neanderthal, a babbling idiot sometimes. I like to show you that person. I like that person. He makes you want to come and listen to me.\u201d\n\nHe hopes fans will tune in as he transitions to the PFL.\n\n\u201cI really want to get into the essence of what people are really about,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cYou really never know a person until you get there and talk to him. You have to make him comfortable when he\u2019s uncomfortable. That\u2019s when you really get into the essence of people.\u201d\n\nThe league was formed in 2017 when a group of investors turned what was the World Series of Fighting into the tournament-style PFL. Kayla Harrison, a two-time Olympic gold medalist , has emerged as the star of the league and is set to face Genah Fabian in her semifinal match Friday. The winner advances to the championship.\n\nTyson, who has also invested in PFL, singled out Harrison as the kind of fighter he wants to hype.\n\nThe 53-year-old Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title. Had MMA leagues been around when Tyson was in his fighting prime, he said he might have stepped inside the cage instead of the ring.\n\n\u201cListen, if I could have made the money I made when I was fighting, I would have loved to try it,\u201d Tyson said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Tyson is ready to talk your ears off about MMA.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/tyson_professional_fighters_league_94730_c0-334-6762-4276_s1770x1032.jpg?acebbd5698a1ab7bf9311f434f30704172593082", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
