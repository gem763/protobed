Both teams open conference play after a bye week. Penn State (3-0) will aim to stay undefeated after the team barely slid past Pittsburgh two weeks ago, while Maryland (2-1) hopes to spark confidence around the program after a loss to Temple stymied its strong start to the season.\n\nMaryland Coach Michael Locksley and Penn State Coach James Franklin coached together in College Park from 2000 to 2002. They were the only two coaches Ralph Friedgen kept on staff when he took over as the head coach in 2001. At the time, Locksley coached running backs and Franklin led the receivers group. Friedgen, who was Maryland\u2019s most successful coach in recent history but fired in 2010, will be honored during Friday\u2019s game. He\u2019s only visited the school two other times since his head-coaching tenure ended.\n\nHow to watch\n\nWhen: Friday, 8 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Maryland Stadium in College Park\n\nLine: Penn State by 6\u00bd\n\nTV: FS1\n\nStreaming: Fox Sports\n\nPenn State had to replace quarterback Trace McSorley this season, but Sean Clifford has played well thus far in the role. Clifford has yet to throw an interception and has dynamic players around him, including receiver KJ Hamler, who has 245 yards on 10 catches through three games. Hamler also presents a significant challenge for the Terps on punt and kickoff returns. The Nittany Lions\u2019 defense has allowed just 10 points per game so far this season.\n\nAfter the sluggish showing in Philadelphia, Maryland\u2019s offense could use this game as a chance to rebound back. But the unit will have to do so with a thin offensive line that lost starting right guard Terrance Davis to a knee injury against Temple.\n\nIn Maryland\u2019s loss to the Owls, quarterback Josh Jackson never found his rhythm and finished the game with the worst completion percentage in his career. The graduate transfer quarterback from Virginia Tech threw for just 183 yards with one touchdown and an interception. But he and Locksley have confidence that performance was simply an outlier. They hope that against Penn State, he\u2019ll revert to playing like the reliable quarterback was against Howard and Syracuse.\n\nPregame reading\n\nWhen Maryland and Penn State play, their coaches will be joined at the roots\n\nJosh Jackson, facing Penn State after his worst game, chalks it up as an \u2018outlier\u2019\n\nMaryland\u2019s bowl path is tougher after Temple loss but maybe not as tough as once thought\n\nMaryland has an entire bye week to stew over its offensive line issues\n\nRalph Friedgen, back in fold with Maryland, will be honored during Penn State game", "description": "Everything you need to know to get ready for the Big Ten opener for both teams.", "authors": ["Emily Giambalvo", "Reporter Covering University Of Maryland Athletics", "September At Am", "Emily Giambalvo Covers University Of Maryland Athletics For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jPM9P8slicCCQzW4eydX4c4-3TY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5N4UI3W3BAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
