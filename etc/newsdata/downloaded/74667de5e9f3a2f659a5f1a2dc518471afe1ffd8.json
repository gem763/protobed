She had a message for white folks: \"ya'll were running from us. ... and you still running because we're no different than the immigrant families that are moving in,\" the former first lady said.\n\n... unbeknownst to us, we grew up in the period, as I write, called white flight. That is families like ours, outstanding families like ours, you know, who were doing everything we were supposed to do and better. As we moved in, white folks moved out because they were afraid of what our families represented. And I always stop there when I talk about this out in the world because I want to remind white folks that ya'll were running from us. You know, because this family -- this family, with all the values that you read about -- you were running from us, and you still running because we're no different than the immigrant families that are moving in... the families that are coming from other places to try and do better.\"\n\nMichelle Obama was referring to her ghostwritten book, \"Becoming,\" where someone else writes about her childhood experiences. But at the Summit on Tuesday, a hypocritical Obama reprimanded white folks for having the audacity to leave their Chicago neighborhoods in search for a better life, something Michelle did when she got into Princeton, Harvard Law School, then the White House. Of course, she had the opportunity to return after her husband left office. But she bought a mansion with a $14.8 million price tag in Martha's Vineyard instead. Talk about a disinvestment from her community.\n\nMichelle Obama says white people are still running from black communities. Welcome to the Obama\u2019s new Chicago... ?? ?? https://t.co/uXxBgXgs0a \u2014 Deneen Borelli (@deneenborelli) October 30, 2019\n\nIn her defense, the Bushes did take flight from the White House in 2008 after President Obama was elected. White folks again took flight in 2012 when they headed to the polls to keep the Obamas in office.\n\nBigotry is an ugly thing. I can only hope Michelle Obama can achieve some sort of success in this country. https://t.co/5Xwt4MzLLC \u2014 Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) October 30, 2019\n\nAfter accusing white people of racism, Michelle then proceeded to complain about the country being so divided. For the first time in her adult life, Michelle Obama should stop trying to divide us.\n\n(Video via Now This News)", "description": "Perennial victim Michelle Obama complained about \"white flight' in an appearance at the 2019 Obama Foundation Summit on Tuesday. .10/30/2019 19:15:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/284/65c6f7cb-352f-43c5-bc69-cba04a43e608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
