As she looked at him in the mirror, he suddenly slipped his hands under her bra straps, she said, then reached down into her robe and grabbed her bare breast.\n\n\u201cIt hurt,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was not gentle. He groped me hard.\u201d She said Domingo then turned and walked away, leaving her stunned and humiliated.\n\nWilson, now 48 and a college voice teacher in the Dallas area, was one of 11 women to come forward after an Aug. 13 AP story in which numerous women accused the long-married, Spanish-born superstar of sexual harassment or inappropriate, sexually charged behavior and of sometimes damaging their careers if they rejected him.\n\nIn the weeks since that story was published, the women have shared new stories about encounters with Domingo, currently the general director of Los Angeles Opera, that they said included unwanted touching, persistent requests for private get-togethers, late-night phone calls and sudden attempts to kiss them on the lips.\n\nSeveral additional backstage employees described for the AP how they strove to shield young women from the star as administrators looked the other way.\n\nTaken together, their stories reinforce a picture of an industry in which Domingo\u2019s behavior was an open secret and young women were left to fend for themselves in the workplace.\n\nDomingo\u2019s spokeswoman issued a statement disputing the allegations but provided no specifics.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing campaign by the AP to denigrate Placido Domingo is not only inaccurate but unethical. These new claims are riddled with inconsistencies and, as with the first story, in many ways, simply incorrect,\u201d spokeswoman Nancy Seltzer said. \u201cDue to an ongoing investigation, we will not comment on specifics, but we strongly dispute the misleading picture that the AP is attempting to paint of Mr. Domingo.\u201d\n\nWilson said she was spurred to come forward after the 78-year-old Domingo\u2019s reaction to the AP\u2019s initial story, in which he said he believed his actions \u201cwere always welcomed and consensual\u201d and added that \u201cthe rules and standards by which we are \u2014 and should be \u2014 measured against today are very different than they were in the past.\u201d\n\nWilson rejects the idea that such behavior has ever been acceptable.\n\n\u201cWhat woman would ever want him to grab their breast? And it hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I had to go on stage and act like I was in love with him.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Placido Domingo acknowledges the audience after receiving the 1999 Hispanic Heritage Award at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, on Sept. 14, 1999.\n\nMelinda McLain, who was the production coordinator at LA Opera for its inaugural season in 1986-87 and also worked at the Houston Grand Opera with Domingo, told the AP she made it a point not to put Domingo in rehearsal rooms alone with young female singers, even if he specifically requested it, and also tried to supply him with male dressers.\n\n\u201cWe created these elaborate schemes for keeping him away from particular singers,\u201d McLain said. \u201cI never would have sent any woman of any sort into his dressing room.\u201d\n\nMcLain said another strategy was to invite Domingo\u2019s wife, Marta, to attend company parties \u201cbecause if Marta was around, he behaves.\u201d\n\nSeveral people who have worked in the costume department of the LA Opera, where Domingo has served in various capacities since the 1980s, said his backstage behavior was common knowledge and that management had been aware of it for years. One employee said her colleagues tried to steer clear of sending women into fittings with Domingo as recently as the 2016-2017 season.\n\n\u201cI was told by my direct boss that they avoided sending any sort of attractive young woman into a fitting with him because of his behavior,\u201d said one employee who requested anonymity because she is still in the opera industry and fears repercussions. She said Domingo was known for \u201cgetting too close, hugging, kissing, touching and being physically affectionate.\u201d\n\nAnother costume employee described narrowly avoiding a wet kiss on the lips from Domingo by turning her head at the last minute so it landed on the side of her mouth. She said she reported it to a supervisor who told her to avoid being alone with Domingo.\n\nThe need for women to come up with their own avoidance strategies just to get their jobs done is a classic example of a sexually hostile work environment, a key legal component of sexual harassment, experts note.\n\nThe LA Opera has hired outside counsel to investigate the allegations in the initial AP story.\n\nWilson was the only new accuser to speak to the AP on the record. The others requested anonymity because they still work in the industry and said they feared recriminations in a world long dominated by Domingo and other powerful men.\n\nOne established soprano said she feared not only for herself but for her husband, who also works in opera. Others spoke of wanting to protect an art form that is struggling to remain relevant in the U.S. And some said vocal support for Domingo in Europe \u2014 and skepticism of the women\u2019s accusations \u2014 has made them more fearful of coming forward publicly.\n\nDomingo\u2019s sometimes brazen backstage pursuits were an open topic of discussion, according to a number of singers and others in the industry.\n\nOne former LA Opera staffer said Domingo once backed her up against a wall, grasped her hand and whispered into her ear as her male boss looked on awkwardly. Someone should have told Domingo it was inappropriate, she said, \u201cbut it shouldn\u2019t be the girl in the hallway on a headset trying to do her job.\u201d\n\nThe employee said wardrobe staff had a joke about spraying female singers \u201cwith tenor spray, like bug spray, to keep the tenors off you.\u201d\n\nSome of the women told the AP that avoidance strategies included asking Domingo about his grandchildren to distract him and giggling awkwardly and pretending they didn\u2019t quite understand when he asked for their phone numbers or suggested they meet somewhere.\n\nBaritone Robert Gardner said he was surprised the star\u2019s behavior hadn\u2019t become public sooner \u201cgiven his reputation inside the industry.\u201d\n\nGardner contacted the AP to say he witnessed Domingo\u2019s behavior with mezzo-soprano Patricia Wulf, who previously was the only accuser willing to be identified by name. Wulf worked with Domingo and Gardner in 1998 at Washington Opera, where the legend also served as general director, and the baritone confirmed that the star persistently propositioned her.\n\n\u201cI saw him positioning himself and maneuvering around rehearsal rooms and in the hallway to get close to her, and she was clearly avoiding him,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nWulf told the AP that Domingo would confront her night after night when they performed together with the same whispered question, uttered very close to her face: \u201d\u2018Patricia, do you have to go home tonight?\u2019\u201d\n\nThough she strenuously tried to avoid him, she said his pursuit seemingly had no bounds and that she feared leaving her dressing room if he was in the hallway. Though Domingo did not physically touch her, she said there was no mistaking his intentions.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Spanish tenor Placido Domingo sings during a rehearsal in Copenhagen, Denmark Tuesday April 4, 2006.\n\nBoth Wulf and Angela Turner Wilson said they did not report the star\u2019s behavior to management, fearing they wouldn\u2019t be believed and that they would be the ones penalized.\n\nWilson told the AP she was aware of Domingo\u2019s reputation by her third season at Washington Opera, but wanted to believe his interest was professional when he began to single her out in the fall of 1999. She said he would sit by her during rehearsal breaks for \u201cLe Cid\u201d and talk to her, telling her \u201cI adore you, Angela.\u201d But it soon became clear his interest was not entirely in her singing, she said.\n\nThere were frequent invitations, Wilson said \u2014 to come to his apartment to watch a video of a role he wanted her to sing. To go to dinner. Just the two of them.\n\n\u201cI would say \u2018No, maestro.\u2019 I said that a lot. I felt like if I put \u2018maestro\u2019 on it, it would still be respectful,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI stuck to no \u2014 \u2019No, I won\u2019t meet you. No, I won\u2019t go with you upstairs to your apartment. No, no, no.\u201d\n\nNot long after performances started Oct. 30, she said he came to her dressing room and entered without knocking, saying he wanted to wish her a good show. Then, she said, he added: \u201cI need a kiss. It\u2019s a demanding role. I need a kiss for strength.\u201d\n\nWilson said she declined, again reminding him she was married, but he continued to insist.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking \u2018I have to get to the door,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI started to open the door and he slammed the door with his foot and his hand and kept his hand on the door and he said, \u2018I need that kiss.\u2019 And he wouldn\u2019t let me out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll make you a deal. You can kiss my cheek\u2019 So he kissed me on my cheek. And then he left. And it scared me so badly. I went back to my dressing table and was shaking. I remember thinking, \u2018Now I\u2019m in trouble. How am I going to manage him now?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the rest of the run, she said, \u201cI would lock my dressing room door. My dresser would tell me if he was outside. She would tell me if he was in the hall and if it was safe.\u201d\n\nLater in the show\u2019s November run, Wilson said she was scheduled to have her makeup done alongside Domingo, which \u201cI thought was strange. ... Usually, big stars, especially headliners, get their makeup done in their dressing room.\u201d But she said was reassured by the fact that the makeup person was also present and the door to the room was open.\n\nShe said that when Domingo first placed his hands on her shoulders, it merely seemed friendly.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was in jeopardy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were having a friendly conversation. ... It just came out of nowhere. It wasn\u2019t like he was complimenting me or seducing me or anything, where I would think I need to be on guard.\u201d\n\nShe said that after he grabbed her breast, she cried out in pain and asked the makeup person, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d Reached by the AP, the makeup artist said he did not recall the incident and did not want to comment further on the record.\n\nShe said she called her husband and her parents that night \u2014 and also the night he tried to kiss her \u2014 and all three confirmed to the AP that she was upset and in tears when she related to them what happened.\n\nWilson provided the AP with copies of a journal she kept at the time that notes rehearsals for \u201cLe Cid\u201d began Oct. 4, 1999. In an entry a month later, she wrote that Domingo \u201chas told me several times how happy he was with my singing,\u201d but also \u201che hits on me all the time.\u201d She added, \u2019Please God don\u2019t let it get any worse.\u201d\n\nThe next season, she said she had three roles but that Domingo barely talked to her or acknowledged her.\n\nThough she won the company\u2019s prestigious Artist of the Year award that season, in 2000, she said the Washington Opera never again hired her, which she attributes to her interactions with Domingo.\n\n\u201cAnybody who gets \u2018singer of the year\u2019 at that company or any company looks at it as a ticket to a relationship with that company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s saying you have done good work and deserve to come back. It\u2019s not usually a farewell.\u201d\n\nHer career lasted another decade before she switched mainly to teaching. She sang three seasons at the New York City Opera and at other venues around the country, including the Dallas Opera and Boston Lyric Opera. She also performed at a state dinner at the White House during the Clinton administration and at the opening of George W. Bush\u2019s presidential library.\n\nA number of the women who criticized Domingo\u2019s behavior also expressed a lingering admiration for the star, calling him charismatic and generous, with a knack for remembering everyone\u2019s name, and someone who has made indelible contributions to the industry.\n\nWilson said she realizes it\u2019s hard for many among his legions of admirers to come to terms with stories of his sexually aggressive actions.\n\n\u201cIt would be hard as a fan to justify or rationalize how somebody so charming and generous in so many ways could be this person,\u201d she said.\n\nFor years, Wilson said she remained silent about her experiences with Domingo \u201cbecause I felt that nobody else would say anything.\u201d But when she read the initial AP story, she said she realized something could be done.\n\n\u201cI know if I miss this opportunity and move on in silence, I will feel 20 times worse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big burden to carry around through your life. And every time another #MeToo story comes out, I go into a dark place, and I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\nShe said she also came forward for the sake of the young women she now teaches as the chair of a university voice department.\n\n\u201cThe music, the art, is so wonderful,\u201d she said, \u201cand I wish the business could at least have the integrity to give these young women a fair shot.\u201d\n\n___\n\nContact Associated Press writer Jocelyn Gecker via Twitter: https://twitter.com/jgecker", "description": "The womens' stories reinforce a picture of an industry in which Domingo\u2019s alleged behavior was an open secret and young women were left to fend for thems...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d711fec250000e2130510a5.jpeg?cache=6qehel0gzm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
