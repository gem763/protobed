REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nPolice fired tear gas and water cannon to break up Tuesday\u2019s rallies in Jakarta and another city, some of the biggest since 1998 student protests fueled unrest that led to the fall of former strongman leader Suharto.\n\nJakarta police chief Gatot Eddy Pramono said 265 students and 39 police were injured on Tuesday, but the extent of their injures was not immediately clear.\n\nPramono said 94 people were arrested in Jakarta where skirmishes continued late into the night. Some of those detained had carried petrol bombs, he told reporters.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo on Friday delayed parliament\u2019s vote on the new criminal code, which would replace a Dutch colonial-era set of laws, saying a new parliament should deliberate on the bill next month.\n\nThe revisions to the code include penalties for sex outside marriage, insulting the president\u2019s dignity, a four-year jail term for abortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape, and a prison term for black magic.\n\nPramono said police are investigating the role of non-student groups in the protests, but he did not give details.\n\n\u201cIf it is proven that they caused damage, whether to the cars or fences, or civilians or security forces, we will take strict measures against them and start the legal process,\u201d Pramono said, referring to fences damaged around parliament.\n\nAside from opposing the new criminal code, students say they are against changes to a law governing the anti-graft agency, known by its initials KPK, and the appointment of new agency commissioners that critics say will weaken the fight against corruption.\n\nOn walls near the parliament building in Jakarta, protesters had scrawled: \u201cParliament is the state\u2019s clown\u201d and \u201cRIP KPK\u201d.\n\nStudents also want a ban on military or police personnel taking up public posts, and the release of \u201cPapuan political prisoners\u201d, referring to the remote Papua region convulsed by civil unrest in recent weeks.\n\nThe students also call for stepped up prevention of forest fires blamed for haze problems, and a renewed effort to address human rights issues.\n\nThousands of students held fresh protests on Wednesday in cities such as Gorontalo, on the island of Sulawesi, and Surabaya in Java, media reported.\n\nStudents from the University of Indonesia had not yet decided if they would rally on Wednesday outside parliament in Jakarta, student leader Manik Marganamahendra told Reuters.\n\nOn Tuesday, speaker of parliament Bambang Soesatyo held a news conference to urge calm, but he declined to say whether the vote on the new criminal code would be held in the current parliamentary session or postponed to a new session.", "description": "Indonesian students rallied for a third day on Wednesday against proposed new laws, including a criminal code that would ban extramarital sex and insulting the president's honor, a day after clashes in the capital injured more than 300 people.", "authors": ["Stanley Widianto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433664140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0EX", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
