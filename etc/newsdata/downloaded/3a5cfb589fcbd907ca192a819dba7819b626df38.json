I\u2019ve just spent half an hour trying to find a parking space. It\u2019s a beautiful day and even the National Trust overflow car park is, well, overflowing. Zen is the very last thing I feel as I head into The Red Lion pub to meet six spiritually minded female friends for a quick ploughman\u2019s lunch before we do a bit of swinging. That\u2019s divining with crystal pendulums to be clear.\n\nOver the remains of the crusty white bread and cheddar, we \u201ccharge\u201d pendulums made of rose quartz and amethyst. Holding them tight in our hands, we imagine them first cleansed by pure white light then filled with a pink mist of love, before asking the pendulums to show us which direction they\u2019re going to swing to give an answer in the positive, an answer in the negative and a \u201chow the hell would I know?\u201d\n\nNever mind the pink mist, I had a feeling I was filling my stone with scepticism. I\u2019m as eager as anyone to have some answers in these uncertain times, but could a crystal pendulum really tell me whether it\u2019s worth betting my life savings on a No Deal Brexit at Paddy Power so I\u2019ll at least be hedged in the worst case scenario?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere are those who believe that crystals can do a whole lot more than that. According to charmsoflight.com, rose quartz \u201crestores trust and harmony in relationships, encouraging unconditional love\u2026 purifies and opens the heart at all levels to promote love, self-love, friendship, deep inner healing and feelings of peace.\u201d Meanwhile Cosmiccuts.com claims that amethyst promotes hormone balance, detoxifies the body and reduces headaches.\n\nShelley Von Strunckel, best known for her astrology \u2013 1.5 million people read her columns every week \u2013 has a wider interest in spirituality and crystals in particular. When I asked her which crystals we should use to attract all the big ticket items people want: love, money, fame, she answered with a hearty laugh. \u201cPeople ask me, will this bring me love? Will this heal me? I have to tell them, no. It\u2019s just a rock. It\u2019s a rock with a pedigree but it\u2019s still a rock.\u201d\n\nShe does, however, believe that crystals are able to attract and store energy. They can hold a charge. She explains that the crystals used in healing work in the same way as the chip in your computer or the quartz in a battery-powered watch. Until energy \u2013 in the case of that computer chip for example, electricity \u2013 flows through them, nothing happens.\n\nCrystal healing doesn\u2019t work because you\u2019ve chosen the right colour rock to \u201cattract\u201d love or cash. It works because crystals amplify our own energy. Von Strunckel gives the example of a bishop\u2019s ring, traditionally a large amethyst, amplifying his blessing. Or the diamonds in the Crown Jewels. \u201cThe seat of wisdom is traditionally the Crown chakra, in the middle of the forehead. So you whack a great big jewel on top of it.\u201d\n\nVon Strunckel summed it up. \u201cUse your crystals as a catalyst to accentuate the positive. A crystal won\u2019t help you find a partner or win the lottery, but it could help you to stay positive and in turn your own positive energy could attract the things you want into your life.\u201d\n\nBack in Avebury, I decided to suspend my disbelief and see if I could instead amplify a little bit of optimism. Avebury is a small village surrounded by a vast Neolithic henge, comprising three stone circles. One of the most famous prehistoric sites in Britain, it\u2019s still a place of spiritual importance to modern believers. The stones at Avebury are \u201csarsen\u201d \u2013 a shortening of Saracen stone. It\u2019s a type of sandstone, which is sand bound with silica. Silica is commonly found as quartz, just like our pendulums. I figured this made the enormous stones at Avebury count as crystalline super-conductors for my purposes.\n\nStanding in front of a stone as big as an elephant, I tried to feel the energy. I certainly felt a breeze. The stones were strangely cold to the touch despite the heat of the day. As I stood with my back against one, I felt a welcome coolness that grew the longer I stood there. One of my companions, who lay her head against a dip in another stone said she could feel her head vibrating before she suddenly burst into happy tears.\n\nWe watched as a majestic greyhound made a beeline for one stone in particular (and not to pee). He circled it several times while his owner told us how the dog had recently undergone an operation to remove a grass seed from one of his lungs. He was still patched with bandages. After the op, the vet did not expect the poor pup to last the night. He told the dog\u2019s owner that she should take him home to make him comfortable and wait for the inevitable. She\u2019d brought him to the stone circle instead. A week later, the dog was getting better by the day. Coincidence? Further on, we encountered a ram leaning heavily against another stone, looking especially blissed out. Are animals more tuned in to the earth\u2019s subtle energies than we are?\n\nWe stopped by the last stone before the National Trust tea-rooms to ask our pendulums some questions. I asked about the novel I\u2019ve just started writing, which is a departure from my usual style. Could I make it work? My pendulum swung clockwise for \u2018yes\u2019. Starting a new book is always difficult. I was happy to take that answer even if I suspected that I was subconsciously helping the pendulum go the right way. In some ways, it didn\u2019t matter did it? I wasn\u2019t really asking the stones about my book. I was asking myself if I thought I had it in me. The crystal was amplifying my answer. My energy, as Von Strunckel had explained.\n\nAfterwards in The Old Forge gift shop, where shelves full of crystals and other esoteric nick-nackery promise all manner of things, I bought a ring made of hematite for \u00a31.50. A little sign claimed that hematite could \u201cdissolve negativity, boost self-esteem and support the blood and circulatory system.\u201d It added: \u201cAlso said to be grounding and protecting.\u201d All for the price of half a latte.\n\nI came home from my day trip to Avebury feeling light-hearted and, yes, I\u2019ll say it, energized. But was it the standing stones? Or the hematite ring, which I cleansed and recharged under running water according to Von Strunckel\u2019s instructions? Hematite is just plain old iron oxide, after all. Or was it the effect of spending a sunny August day in a beautiful setting in the company of good friends? I\u2019m still wearing the ring for now, just in case. At the very least, every time I look at it, I\u2019m reminded of the glorious Wiltshire countryside, the feeling of sunshine on my face and the lazy buzz of bees on summer flowers. And that\u2019s no bad thing.", "description": "It\u2019s\u00a0Tuesday lunchtime in Avebury, home to the world\u2019s largest stone circle.
