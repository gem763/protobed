(Mark Lennihan/AP)\n\nAdam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s embattled co-founder and chief executive, is stepping down.\n\nNeumann\u2019s leadership has come under fire in recent weeks after the co-working space startup, recently renamed the We Co., postponed a bid to go public as its valuation plummeted. He will stay in leadership as nonexecutive chairman of the board.\n\nHe will be replaced by two co-CEOs: Artie Minson, formerly the company\u2019s co-president and chief financial officer; and Sebastian Gunningham, who was vice chairman.\n\nThe news was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday and was later confirmed by the company.\n\n[Adam Neumann\u2019s chaotic energy built WeWork. Now it might cost him his job as CEO.]\n\nThe unseating of Neumann is the latest in a string of roller-coaster months for tech companies attempting to go public in what was supposed to be a record year. Ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft both stumbled out of the gates with IPOs earlier this year, as investors failed to value the largely unprofitable companies as high as expected. Meanwhile, Slack Technologies debuted well with a direct offering.\n\nThe We Co. was valued at $47 billion as recently as January, according to Pitchbook. It publicly filed for an IPO in August, though the plan was delayed after investors expressed skepticism about the company\u2019s valuation and concerns arose about Neumann\u2019s leadership. Reuters reported earlier this month that the firm might seek a valuation as low as $10 billion.\n\nThe disappointing IPOs of Uber and Lyft brought increased scrutiny to the valuation of We Co., said D.A. Davidson analyst Barry Oxford. Investors have grown more concerned about a potential recession and are more reticent to invest in a company with such high, long-term costs. And the emphasis on Neumann\u2019s leadership as core to the company\u2019s future success signaled potential corporate governance issues.\n\n\u201cIf you take those things and you throw in erratic behavior, that was the proverbial straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d said Oxford.\n\n[WeWork IPO filing follows uneven road for other companies going public]\n\nIn a news release, Neumann said the scrutiny directed toward him \u201chad become a significant distraction\u201d and that it was in the company\u2019s best interest for him to step down.\n\nNeumann\u2019s departure casts the future of the We Co. in doubt. In its IPO prospectus, the company said its success \u201cdepends in large part on the continued service of Adam Neumann.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Adam does not continue to serve as our Chief Executive Officer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nThe 40-year-old Neumann has been a controversial figure for the company, in part because he walked around the office barefoot and made alcohol \u2014 including tequila \u2014 a big component of the startup\u2019s culture, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal. His goals include becoming a trillionaire, establishing WeWork on Mars and even becoming \u201cpresident of the world,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nNeumann has majority voting rights, as well as the power to fire the board. His risky practices of borrowing against his stock, as well as holding stakes in companies that lease to the company have resulted in worries about potentially problematic self dealings.\n\nWeWork even paid Neumann nearly $6 million for his trademark rights to the word \u201cWe\u201d before he returned the money, according to company filings. The We Co. prospectus contains the word \u201cAdam\u201d 169 times.\n\n[WeWork Isn\u2019t Solving Its Biggest Problem]\n\n\u201cAdam is a unique leader who has proven he can simultaneously wear the hats of visionary, operator and innovator, while thriving as a community and culture creator,\u201d according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cGiven his deep involvement in all aspects of the growth of our company, Adam\u2019s personal dealings have evolved across a number of direct and indirect transactions and relationships with the Company.\u201d\n\nWeWork\u2019s core \u201cspace-as-a-service\u201d business involves turning leased buildings into co-working spaces that offer perks like yoga classes and kombucha taps. Recently, the company has expanded into other ventures under the We Co. umbrella, such as apartment rentals, data analytics and education.\n\nSince its founding, the company has raised more than $12 billion in funding but has never turned a profit. It burned through $2 billion last year alone, according to its prospectus. Multiple outlets recently reported that some board members had lost confidence in Neumann and were contemplating his removal.\n\nThe company has hundreds of offices in more than 30 countries. It is currently the largest private office tenant in Manhattan.", "description": "Neumann\u2019s leadership has come under fire in recent weeks after a WeWork bid to go public was postponed as the company\u2019s valuation plummeted.", "authors": ["Marie C.
