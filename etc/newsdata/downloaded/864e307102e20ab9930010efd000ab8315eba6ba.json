Both the Taliban and the Islamic State group are active in Nangarhar province.\n\nWitnesses said the roof of the mosque had fallen through after the \"loud\" explosion, the nature of which was not immediately clear.\n\n\"Dozens of people were killed and wounded and were taken in several ambulances,\" Haji Amanat Khan, a 65-year-old local resident, told AFP.\n\nThe blast came after the UN released a new report on Thursday saying an \"unprecedented\" number of civilians were killed or wounded in Afghanistan from July to September.\n\nThe report, which also charts violence throughout 2019 so far, underscores how \"Afghans have been exposed to extreme levels of violence for many years\" despite promises by all sides to \"prevent and mitigate harm to civilians\".\n\nIt also noted the absurdity of the ever-increasing price paid by civilians given the widespread belief that the war in Afghanistan cannot be won by either side.\n\n\"Civilian casualties are totally unacceptable,\" said the UN's special representative in Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, adding they demonstrate the importance of talks leading to a ceasefire and a permanent political settlement.\n\nThe figures - 1 174 deaths and 3 139 injured from July 1 until September 30 - represent a 42% increase compared to the same time period last year.\n\nThe UN laid most of the blame for the spike at the feet of \"anti-government elements\" such as the Taliban, who have been carrying out a bloody insurgency in Afghanistan for more than 18 years.\n\nJuly alone saw more casualties than in any other month on record since the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) began documenting the violence in 2009.\n\nThe first six months of 2019 had seen casualties drop slightly compared to previous years.\n\nBut the violence has surged so far in the third quarter that it yanked the overall total for the year back on par with the bloodiest since NATO withdrew its combat forces at the end of 2014.", "description": "At least 28 worshippers were killed and dozens wounded by a blast inside an Afghan mosque during Friday prayers, officials said, a day after the United Nations said violence in the country had reached \"unacceptable\" levels.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/b866152942464460b586357fd696f032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
