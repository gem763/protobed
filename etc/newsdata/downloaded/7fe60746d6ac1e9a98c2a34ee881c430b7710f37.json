The RBA considers that 2020 is possibly the low year for the residential construction sector.\n\nThe RBA's observations are consistent with the latest market insights from CoreLogic, which suggests an undersupply of dwellings in Melbourne is likely in the next 24 months, if not earlier. New housing supply continues to be an issue in Hobart, with Tasmania having the lowest affordability, relative to income, for both buyers and renters.\n\nDr Debelle noted in his speech that the long lead times for high-density construction projects means the supply response to increased housing demand can be slow, leading to higher prices for existing stock.\n\nRBA deputy governor Guy Debelle. Peter Rae\n\nGiven the significance of the residential construction sector to the overall Australian economy (6 per cent of GDP for the three years from the beginning of 2016), Dr Debelle highlighted that the downturn in residential construction will have an effect on the economy that is \"greater than the direct effect of the decline in construction, with significant spillovers to other parts of the economy and also inflation\".\n\nIn light of these clear warnings on the significant negative impacts of a residential construction sector slowdown, it is reasonable to ask whether state surcharges that deter foreign investment in residential property are currently doing more harm than good.\n\nAt a Commonwealth level, the Foreign Investment Review Board website states: \"The Government's policy is to channel foreign investment into new dwellings as this creates additional jobs in the construction industry and helps support economic growth\". Consistent with this policy, FIRB restrictions mean that foreign buyers are limited to purchasing new dwellings or vacant residential land for development.\n\nIt follows that to the extent state surcharges are deterring foreign investment in new dwellings, this is having a negative effect on the residential construction sector and associated economic growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, surcharge rates that can be dialled up at the peak of the residential property cycle can be dialled down towards the bottom of the cycle. This presents the states with a stimulus option not available during previous residential construction downturns.\n\nProviding new housing investment stimulus is not a zero sum game. If increased foreign investment results in new housing stock that would not have otherwise been built, this will improve GST revenue (because GST only applies to the first sale of new residential premises). All GST revenue is distributed to the states and territories, meaning it is effectively a state tax.\n\nOn October 23, the West Australian government announced it would provide a 75 per cent duty rebate for off-the-plan purchases of new apartments for the next two years, capped at $50,000 per apartment.\n\nThis rebate approach may have been preferred on the basis it will reduce duty costs for both local and foreign buyers, while also incentivising a wider pool of potential purchasers.\n\nAs a proud alumnus of the UTAS Law School in Hobart, I'm baffled by the Tasmanian government's plans to increase duty surcharges during a housing affordability crisis.\n\nWhen the Tasmanian budget was released in May, it was announced the current 3 per cent surcharge would increase to 7 per cent from January 1, 2020. However, the Tasmanian government recently announced it would lift the rate to 8 per cent, seemingly for no other reason than to match NSW and Victoria.\n\nLower duty surcharges may not be a silver bullet, but it is difficult to see how higher rates will encourage much-needed new investment that may relieve pressure on rental and housing prices.\n\nMatthew Cridland is a partner at K &L Gates.", "description": "In less than four years, all six Australian states have quickly introduced duty surcharges on foreign buyers of residential property.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cf4180c8f06050cc22bd8a40be365842ac86a74f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
