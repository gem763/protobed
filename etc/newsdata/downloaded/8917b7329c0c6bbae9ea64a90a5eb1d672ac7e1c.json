Both countries entered recession with household savings rates in 2007 that were above their 10-year average.\n\nBy contrast, Spain, Portugal and Finland took longest to recover -- around nine to 10 years -- and had household savings rates furthest below their 10-year average in 2007.\n\nBritain, which entered recession with a slightly below-average household savings rate, was broadly in the middle of the pack in terms of recovery time, at roughly 5 years.\n\nThe analysis excluded Australia, which avoided recession, and Italy and Greece, whose economies have yet to recover to their pre-crisis sizes.\n\nThe world's fifth-biggest economy shrank in the second quarter of 2019 and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has raised the risk of its first recession since the financial crisis, even if some of those concerns were eased last week when data showed output grew in July more strongly than expected.\n\nOn the plus side, wages in Britain are growing at their fastest pace since before the financial crisis, which should help to restore household finances.\n\nBut the broader picture still suggests Britain will need to lean on spending by the government to drive any recovery from a future recession.\n\nBritain's household savings ratio stood at 4.2% in 2018, up only slightly from the record low of 3.9% struck in 2017.\n\n\"The poor savings ratio for more than two years suggests rainy day funds are thinner in UK than in other G7 countries,\" French from Panmure Gordon said.\n\nUK household savings rate and recesssions: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/613/609/hh23.png\n\nFISCAL FIREPOWER\n\nThe Resolution Foundation think-tank last week said Britain was not ready for a recession and proposed changes to the way it manages its economy to see off the downturn when it comes.\n\nIt called for a pipeline of shovel-ready infrastructure projects which could be sped up in a crisis and it said direct payments could be made to households if necessary.\n\nFinance minister Sajid Javid has promised the biggest day-to-day spending increases in 15 years, a move widely seen as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's push for an election to break the Brexit impasse.\n\nHe is due to announce new fiscal rules later this year.\n\n\"With government borrowing costs running at record lows and monetary policy lacking conventional ammunition to fight a slowdown in the economy, the economic case for a rise in public spending is a strong one,\" Martin Beck, an economist at consultancy Oxford Economics, said.", "description": "Stretched households could mean lengthy UK downturn, if it comes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8F0UU_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
