But few scenes encapsulate how ridiculous things have gotten like the spat that led to the White House suspending Playboy White House reporter Brian Karem\u2019s press pass.\n\nA judge ruled Tuesday that the White House must return Karem\u2019s pass \u2014 but not before laying out in excruciating detail exactly how we arrived at that point: to wit, a confrontation between him and former White House aide Sebastian Gorka.\n\nThe White House Rose Garden was particularly ripe for such a scene July 11, as right-wing \u201cinfluencers\u201d were invited to meet with Trump before the news conference and then allowed to attend it alongside the mainstream media that many of them deride as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what followed, according to the judge\u2019s ruling, including the original citations. You can click on the yellow highlights to read my annotations via Genius.\n\nOn July 11, 2019, President Trump hosted a number of internet influencers and personalities at the White House grounds at what the administration called a Social Media Summit. At the Summit\u2019s conclusion, the attendees were invited to the Rose Garden to watch the President deliver prepared remarks with the Attorney General. Unlike the Summit itself, the remarks were open to the White House press corps, so Brian Karem decided to go. Upon arrival in the Rose Garden, Karem and other members of the press were directed to a roped-off, standing-room-only press area that had been set up around the rows of chairs where the Summit attendees were permitted to sit. Some Summit attendees were already in their seats, and the atmosphere became, in the words of one press member, \u201cunusually tense.\u201d McAteer Decl. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 2-9. Certain Summit attendees began photographing the members of the press and calling them \u201cfake news.\u201d Id. Among those attendees participating was former presidential advisor Sebastian Gorka, who at one point stood up to take a wide-frame picture of the press \u2014 calling it a \u201cFake News panorama.\u201d Id.; Ex. 70 at 0:05\u20140:08.1\n\nUltimately, the President gave his remarks without incident, and when he finished, he turned to walk back into the White House. Karem called out in an attempt to ask the President a question, but the President ignored it and went inside. Ex. 60 at 0:00\u20140:09. Karem\u2019s question did, however, draw a reaction from some of the Summit attendees. One shouted, \u201cHe talked to us, the real news.\u201d Id. at 0:10\u20140:12. Another said sarcastically, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, don\u2019t be sad.\u201d Id. at 0:13\u20140:15. Karem responded by smiling and making what was apparently a joke. Gesturing toward the seated Summit attendees, he said, \u201cThis is a group eager for demonic possession,\u201d before saluting and turning away. Ex. 61 at 0:01\u20140:06.\n\nKarem\u2019s statement drew laughter from several of the attendees, but Gorka took it differently. Seated a number of rows in front of Karem\u2019s position in the press area, Gorka turned around in his chair and yelled, \u201cAnd you\u2019re a \u2018journalist,\u2019 right?\u201d\u2014making air quotes with his hands. Ex. 60 at 0:21\u20140:25. With the event having concluded, Gorka and other seated attendees began to stand, and as they did so, Karem said, \u201cHey come on over here and talk to me, brother, or we can go outside and have a long conversation.\u201d Ex. 61 at 0:10\u20140:14. Karem simultaneously motioned backward with his right thumb over his shoulder and raised his eyebrows. Id.\n\nBy the time Karem had finished his sentence, Gorka was walking briskly toward him across the Rose Garden \u2014 shouting, \u201cAre you threatening me now in the White House? In the Rose Garden? You are threatening me in the Rose Garden?\u201d Ex. 60 at 0:29\u20140:36. As Gorka approached, Karem took a few steps forward himself, but remained within the roped-off press area. Ex. 61 at 0:16\u20140:21. Karem, his voice now slightly quieter, explained \u201cI said I\u2019d be happy to talk to you.\u201d Id. at 0:17\u20140:19. Gorka, still yelling, responded, \u201cYou are a punk! You\u2019re not a journalist! You\u2019re a punk!\u201d Id. at 0:20\u20140:24. Gorka then turned and walked away, at which time some of the Summit attendees began chanting, \u201cGorka! Gorka! Gorka!\u201d Ex. 62 at 0:01\u20140:08. While Gorka walked away and the crowd\u2019s chant was ongoing, Karem raised the volume of his voice again, and twice said to Gorka, \u201cGo home,\u201d before shouting \u201cHey Gorka, get a job!\u201d Ex. 61 at 0:23\u20140:29.\n\nMoments later, another one of the Summit attendees, who was filming the scene on his phone, said loudly to Karem, \u201cHey, just for the record he\u2019d kick your punk a--\u201d (\u201che\u201d meaning Gorka). Id. at 0:31\u20140:37; Ex. 62 at 0:09\u20140:11. From others in the crowd, this remark prompted a mixture of laughs and groans \u2014 and even an exasperated \u201cOh my God.\u201d Ex. 62 at 0:11\u20140:14. Karem, meanwhile, responded to the remark by taking a couple of steps to his right and saying, \u201cAnd that\u2019s the measure of everything, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ex. 60 at 0:48\u20140:53. By this time, Karem was (perhaps inadvertently) standing on the other side of the press-area\u2019s demarcating rope, which had at some point fallen to the ground. Id. A Secret Service agent quickly noticed and approached Karem, who stepped back into the press area. Id. at 0:54\u20141:01. Karem and the agent then spoke for a few seconds, but the substance of their conversation is not audible in the various video recordings. E.g., id. at 0:54\u20141:01.\n\nA few minutes later, after leaving the Rose Garden, Karem saw Gorka again \u2014 this time in the White House\u2019s Palm Room. Karem walked over, put his left hand on Gorka\u2019s right arm, and tried to explain that, in making his earlier comment, he had only meant that he wanted to talk. See Ex. 63 at 2:59\u20143:02. Gorka, however, disagreed, which prompted Karem to raise his right index finger and repeat, \u201cI said \u2018talk.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 3:04\u20143:05. Gorka, who noticed that a White House staffer was trying to usher all press out of the room, responded by repeatedly saying to Karem, \u201cYou\u2019re done.\u201d Id. at 3:02\u20143:12. Recognizing that he had to leave, Karem tried to shake hands, but Gorka refused, so Karem walked away.
