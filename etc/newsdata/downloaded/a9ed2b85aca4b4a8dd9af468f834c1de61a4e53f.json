Maybe the answer is to shirk at work instead\n\nName: \u201cWorking from home.\u201d\n\nAge: The child-rearing years.\n\nAppearance: \u201cBusy.\u201d Seriously \u201cbusy\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s with all this \u201cquotation business\u201d? Obviously some people need to work from home sometimes to look after their kids or whatever, but \u2026 \u201cWorking from home\u201d always sounds as though it has quotation marks around it, don\u2019t you think?\n\nNo. I work from home all the time. Ah, but do you really? Do you sit at your desk when the working day begins, and work just as hard as you would in the office?\n\nYes, I really do. I\u2019m extremely lazy in the office too, remember. And when you\u2019re \u201cworking from home\u201d, do you by any chance have long lunches in front of Bargain Hunt?\n\nHell yeah. A-ha! That is just what some employers suspect! According to a survey of its members, a professional network called Cityparents says that 38% of 683 respondents based in London did not think that flexible working \u201cis \u2018genuinely encouraged\u2019 in their firm\u201d.\n\nYou mean they\u2019re on to us? Could be.\n\nBut I put on a clean shirt when we have video conferences! Sometimes even trousers! Those are smart moves, but they may not be enough. \u201cToo many people refer to \u2018shirking from home\u2019 for working from home to be considered a genuine benefit,\u201d one respondent said.\n\nWould bosses prefer people to shirk in the office? At least then they could catch you doing it, I guess. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get one day a week work from home approved,\u201d another respondent said, \u201c\u2018in case I did my washing\u2019.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much danger of me doing mine. Not even at the weekend. That is sadly true.\n\nAnd should I trust this survey, in which 38% of people being offered the chance to work from home don\u2019t think they can take it? Well, Cityparents campaigns for more flexible working, and that is what its members said.\n\nSo they asked people who agree with them whether they agree with them? Yes.\n\nAnd it turns out they do? That\u2019s right.\n\nThey make a strong case. Except \u2026 if your employer can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019ve done your job when you \u201cwork from home\u201d, does your job actually need doing? Er \u2026\n\nAnd if you can get away with shirking, isn\u2019t that proof you should be made redundant anyway? Ssh!\n\nAnd maybe your bosses should be sacked for hiring you in the first place? That\u2019s a much better idea.\n\nDo say: \u201cDon\u2019t work hard at home. Work slowly in the office.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cThis is an automatic reply. I\u2019m in the bath today.\u201d", "description": "According to a survey, flexible working is still discouraged by suspicious managers.
