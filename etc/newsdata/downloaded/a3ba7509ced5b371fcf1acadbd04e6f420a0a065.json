While showrunner Peter Morgan has remained tight-lipped on what to expect, a quick brush up on our Royal Family history tells us what we will probably see happen in future episodes.\n\nThis is the era in which Queen Elizabeth II worked closely with new Prime Minister Harold Wilson with the government leader set to be introduced in the third season. Britain's first female PM Margaret Thatcher will also appear, but likely toward the end of the third season if nor the the fourth.\n\nThis next batch of episodes is also expected to include Princess Margaret\u2019s eight-year affair with baronet Roddy Llewellyn that culminates in her divorce from Lord Snowden.\n\nRoyal figures confirmed to appear in the back half of the third season include Camilla Parker-Bowles (Emerald Fennell) and Lady (later Princess) Diana Spencer who will reportedly be the focus of the fourth season. She'll be played by Emma Corrin.\n\nOther key moments set to be ticked off include the birth of Prince Edward as well as the 1969 coronation of Prince Charles who will feature more prominently in the season ahead.\n\nWho will star in it?\n\nThe identity of the actors replacing the show\u2019s original stars has been the subject of a lot of speculation, but the confirmed cast members have taken shape (you can feats your eyes on first-look photos here):\n\nOlivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II\n\nTobias Menzies as Prince Philip\n\nHelena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret\n\nJosh O\u2019Connor as Prince Charles\n\nMarion Bailey as Queen Mother\n\nBen Daniels as Antony Armstrong-Jones\n\nJason Watkins as Harold Wilson\n\nGillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher\n\nErin Doherty as Princess Anne\n\nEmerald Fennell as Camilla Parker Bowles\n\nCharles Dance as Lord Louis Mountbatten\n\nEmma Corrin as Princess Diana", "description": "In three short years, The Crown has become one of the most successful shows on television.
