Harvard College Writing Centre director Jane Rosenzweig praises the nine-page whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration in a New York Times op-ed, listing four techniques that make the complaint clear and effective. They might just help you write like a pro, too.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly outlined\n\nThree of the techniques \u2014 an urgent introduction, strong, connected subheadings, and topic sentences \u2014 reflect the piece\u2019s clear and linear structure. You could pull out the subheadings and topic sentences to create a bullet-point outline of the document\u2019s takeaways.\n\nThis makes the document easy to read and hard to dismiss. It also helps the information spread, because news outlets can accurately summarise the complaint for a wider audience \u2014 an audience that will read a two-page article but not a nine-page government memo.\n\nIt\u2019s active\n\nThe other technique \u2014 active sentences with a subject and verb \u2014 assigns cause and effect to specific people. The whistleblower believes specific people did specific things, in violation of specific rules. He only uses the passive voice when he knows that someone did something but can\u2019t figure out who. He points this out, making the limits of his complaint clear instead of vaguely implying blame:\n\nAccording to these officials, it was also \u201cmade clear\u201d to them that the [U.S.] President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy \u201cchose to act\u201d in office. I do not know how this guidance was communicated, or by whom.\ufeff\n\nThis is an obvious foil to President Word Salad\u2019s love for water-muddying phrases like \u201cmore and more people are saying.\u201d\n\nYou can write like that too\n\nIf you want to write with a strong structure, you have two options: outline meticulously and then write inside that outline, or write first, then rearrange your writing into a clear outline.\n\nDepending on your style and your mood, one of these will feel much less scary than the other. Sometimes it\u2019s outlining: You don\u2019t have to do the \u201creal\u201d writing yet, you\u2019re just listing the ideas you want to write later! If you\u2019re really on a roll, you\u2019ll keep outlining at smaller increments, until you\u2019ve accidentally written most of the piece.\n\nThe outline method is especially effective for persuasive and explanatory writing, like memos and essays and emails. But it can work in creative writing too, if it doesn\u2019t stifle fun ideas and make your work boring and predictable.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s less scary to write freely, putting down your thoughts in the order they come to you. You don\u2019t have to do the \u201creal\u201d writing yet, you\u2019re just saying all the interesting things first and you\u2019ll put them in order and fill in the blanks later!\n\nIt\u2019s harder to \u201caccidentally\u201d write an entire piece this way, but it leaves more room for surprises, and for discovering what you actually want to say when you\u2019re not sure yet. When you have the urge to say something, but you don\u2019t know what, just get it all out with no self-editing. Then put down your draft, come back after an hour or more, and edit. Repeat this cycle several times.\n\nYou\u2019ll often write in between: writing full sentences, trying to make each make sense, and trying to organise as you write. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that. But if you start to hate the process of writing, try only free writing or only outlining. Yes, you\u2019re putting off the hard part, but you\u2019re making it less hard in the process.\n\nThe Whistle-Blower Knows How to Write | NYT", "description": "This is not normal: A U.S. government employee wrote a good memo.
