More than 87,000 people have visited Chernobyl so far this year, up from 72,000 in 2018.\n\n\u201cChernobyl has been a negative part of Ukraine\u2019s brand,\u201d President Zelensky has said previously. \u201cThe time has come to change this.\n\n\u201cWe will create a green corridor for tourists. Chernobyl is a unique place on the planet where nature was reborn after a huge man-made disaster.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have to show this place to the world: to scientists, ecologists, historians and tourists.\u201d", "description": "The control room of Chernobyl\u2019s reactor four, the site of the world\u2019s most devastating nuclear catastrophe, is to open to tourists.
