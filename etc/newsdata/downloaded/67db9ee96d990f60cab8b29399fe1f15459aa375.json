Most agreed.\n\n\u201cI want to echo the sentiments and the emotion of Greta -- that she could come here and condemn us all,\u201d said Allen Michael Chastanet, prime minister of the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia. \u201cAnd deservedly so.\u201d\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called on world leaders at Monday\u2019s Climate Action Summit -- held in tandem with a two-week general assembly -- to make more aggressive pledges to curb greenhouse-gas emissions and keep the world from warming to catastrophic temperatures. The meeting was marked by at times contrite remarks from the likes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron and India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Even U.S. President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance, but didn\u2019t speak.\n\nIt followed youth-led climate strikes that inspired millions to take to the streets on Friday and over the weekend in major cities from London to Paris to New York and kicked off a series of more than 150 climate-related events being held across Manhattan as part of a larger program known as Climate Week. In all, billions of dollars were pledged by governments and businesses to combat global warming, but few made commitments that went significantly beyond what they were already doing.\n\nAnd the leaders of the world\u2019s two biggest polluters -- the U.S. and China -- were noticeably absent from the speakers\u2019 list.\n\n\u201cNot one single nation is getting the job done,\u201d former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said during an opening ceremony of Climate Week. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder our kids are in the streets, screaming at us.\u201d\n\nHere are the highlights of Monday\u2019s climate talks:\n\nA Sense of Optimism\n\nGuterres worked in the days leading up to the summit to instill a sense of urgency among heads of state. He warned that the world faces \u201cat least 3 degrees Celsius of global heating by the end of the century.\u201d And while he won\u2019t be there to see it, he said, \u201cMy granddaughters will. And your grandchildren, too. I refuse to be an accomplice in the destruction of their home and only home.\u201d\n\nDespite the dire warning, several world leaders stressed that it\u2019s not too late. Climate change is a serious problem, they said, but there are solutions. \u201cWe are still in time -- let us not allow that window to close,\u201d Pope Francis said in a video address that was broadcast at the summit.\n\nTrump\u2019s Surprise Visit\n\nTrump made an unexpected appearance at the UN, along with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mick Mulvaney, acting chief of staff. Trump only stayed for about 15 minutes, and wasn\u2019t in the audience for Thunberg\u2019s speech, but he did hear remarks by Modi and Merkel.\n\nThe president on Sunday denied that he intended to snub the climate event, pointing to a briefing he received on flooding in the Houston area as evidence he is concerned about climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s not a snub at all. I\u2019m very busy,\u201d Trump said as he departed the White House. \u201cThe floods are very important to me, and uh, climate change -- everything is very important.\u201d\n\nAttacks on Trump\n\nHis appearance didn\u2019t keep the critics away. Trump\u2019s climate change policies, mostly notably his efforts to roll back environmental policies and his 2017 decision to pull the U.S. out of the global Paris climate agreement, came under attack several times.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell happened to our country that we have the president that we have in this issue,\u201d California Governor Gavin Newsom said during the Climate Week opening ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely humiliated.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the world will continue to battle climate change without the U.S. While Wang didn\u2019t call out Trump by name at the UN summit, he said the \u201cwithdrawal of certain parties\u201d from the global climate agreement \u201cwill not shake the collective will of the international community, nor will it reverse the historical trend of international cooperation.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- World leaders and chief executives of global corporations gathered at a United Nations summit on Monday to say that a 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden is right: They are failing.Greta Thunberg -- the teenager who sparked a global youth movement to fight climate change -- arrived", "authors": ["Will Wade", "Saijel Kishan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2PR5cm1j92MwHnOoSx044g--~B/aD02ODQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/edad976b1e059bcb57ce7bd414a33d10", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
