He also serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget.", "description": "Top White House aide Mick Mulvaney said Sunday he has \"absolutely not\" been asked to resign over his public admission that Donald Trump had tied military aid for Ukraine to Kiev's opening a probe into the Democrats.
