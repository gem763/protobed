REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz\n\nThe campaign made its plea in letters to the companies after a false claim spread on social media this week that the gunman responsible for an Aug. 31 mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, had a sticker supporting O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy on his truck.\n\nIn its letter to Twitter, the O\u2019Rourke campaign pointed to an account with the handle @suemo54 and name Sue Moore, which posted the claim on Sunday. It has been retweeted more than 11,000 times since then.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, said in the letters that the campaign thought a network of bots on Twitter and Facebook amplified the false claim.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t our job to clean up: it\u2019s theirs,\u201d she wrote on Twitter, calling for increased transparency into misinformation on the sites and for Twitter to start labelling false content of public importance.\n\n\u201cOur democracy depends on these platforms managing the crisis of disinformation. We\u2019re aware they\u2019ve all made efforts to improve. We are saying these efforts have been insufficient,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote.\n\nTwitter declined to comment on the matter.\n\nTwitter users trying to access the @suemo54 account on Friday were shown a warning that it was \u201ctemporarily restricted\u201d due to \u201cunusual activity.\u201d The tweet could still be viewed, however.\n\nThe nonpartisan FactCheck.org website on Friday debunked the claim. It cited Sergeant Oscar Villarreal, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, as saying \u201cthere was no sticker\u201d on the gunman\u2019s car and that he was not aware of the gunman\u2019s political preferences.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has taken an increasingly vocal stance on the campaign trail against gun violence in the wake of recent mass shootings, including one that killed 22 people on Aug. 3 in El Paso, Texas, which he used to represent in Congress.\n\nA Facebook spokesman said the company had taken action through its fact-checking programme by limiting the distribution of a post spreading the sticker claim that had been shared 42,000 times. It also added the FactCheck.org piece as a \u201crelated article\u201d below the post.\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign\u2019s letter to Google pointed out that terms like Odessa and the shooter\u2019s name were trending queries related to its candidate on the search engine after the misinformation was published. A Google spokeswoman told Reuters that its search function is not a recommendation system and so a \u201ctrending\u201d query in Google Trends does not mean that the site is recommending a topic to users.\n\nThe letters come just days after federal law enforcement met with Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O) at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, to discuss collaboration over election security strategies.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke's campaign on Friday called on Facebook , Twitter and Alphabet's Google to do more to fight disinformation ahead of the November 2020 election.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427094358&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8600Y", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
