REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nSome protesters threw bricks at police outside the nearby Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army base in the city and tore down and set fire to a red banner proclaiming the 70th anniversary on Oct. 1 of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nOne water cannon caught fire after being hit by a petrol bomb. The water cannon fired blue jets of water, used elsewhere in the world to help identify protesters later.\n\n\u201cPolice warn the protesters to stop their illegal acts and leave the scene immediately,\u201d police said in a statement.\n\nThe Chinese-ruled territory has been rocked by more than three months of clashes, with demonstrators angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nOn July 1, the anniversary of the city\u2019s 1997 return to China, protesters wearing hard hats, masks and black shirts laid siege to the Legislative Council building and swarmed inside.\n\nEarlier in the day, protesters gathered peacefully outside the British Consulate, calling on Britain to rein in China.\n\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984, lays out Hong Kong\u2019s future after its return to China in 1997, a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\n\u201cSino-British Joint Declaration is VOID,\u201d one placard read in the protest outside the British Consulate.\n\n\u201cSOS Hong Kong,\u201d read another.\n\n\u201cOne country, two systems is dead,\u201d protesters shouted in English under umbrellas shielding them from the sub-tropical sun, some carrying the colonial flag also bearing the Union Jack. \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nViolence has broken out on previous weekends with protesters trashing metro stations and setting fires in the streets. The police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nThe spark for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.\n\nThe protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\n\u2018LEGALLY BINDING\u2019\n\nChina says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement, denies meddling and says the city is an internal Chinese issue. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by the 1984 declaration.\n\nHong Kong island was granted to Britain \u201cin perpetuity\u201d in 1842 at the end of the First Opium War. Kowloon, a peninsula on the mainland opposite Hong Kong island, joined later, after the Second Opium War.\n\nThe colony was expanded to include the New Territories, to the north of Kowloon, on a 99-year lease, in 1898.\n\nBritain returned all of the territory to China, which never recognised the \u201cunequal treaties\u201d, in 1997.\n\nSlideshow (26 Images)\n\n\u201cThe Joint Declaration is a legally binding treaty between the UK and China that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago,\u201d a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in June.\n\n\u201cAs a co-signatory, the UK government will continue to defend our position.\u201d\n\nBut it was not immediately clear what Britain could or would want to do to defend that position. It is pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with China, which since 1997 has risen to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after it leaves the European Union at the end of next month.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired water cannon and volleys of tear gas to break up protesters throwing petrol bombs and bricks near the Legislative Council building and central government offices on Sunday, the latest in weeks of sometimes violent unrest.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430067106&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E07J", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
