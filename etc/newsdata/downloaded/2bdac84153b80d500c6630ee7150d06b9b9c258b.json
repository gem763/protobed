They call on Iran to co-operate with the IAEA on all relevant matters, including safeguards issues.\"\n\nThe row comes as Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei ruled out fresh talks with the US ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week.\n\nUntil sanctions are lifted, Ayatollah Khamenei said \"there will be no talks at any level between officials of the Islamic Republic and Americans, neither in New York, nor elsewhere,\" according to state media.\n\nIt comes after the US alleged Iran was to blame for attacks at oil facilities in Saudi Arabia - a claim Tehran denies.\n\nIranian-backed Houthi rebels, who are at war with a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, have claimed they carried out the strikes.\n\nDowning Street said work is still ongoing to establish what happened in the attacks at a processing plant and a key oil field.\n\nThe prime minister spoke to German chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday, where the pair \"discussed Saturday's attacks in Saudi Arabia and the need to work together, alongside international partners, to agree a collective response\".\n\nThe PM's official spokesman said: \"On the issue of Iran, they reaffirmed their commitment to a common approach and the importance of avoiding the further escalation of tensions in the region.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson\u00a0should follow Donald Trump's lead and declare the Iran nuclear deal is\u00a0\"dead\", a former Tory cabinet minister is expected to say.
