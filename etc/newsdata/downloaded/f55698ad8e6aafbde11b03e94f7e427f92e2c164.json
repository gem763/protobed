They Should Just Embrace It", "language": "en", "text": "Let\u2019s dispense with the fiction that the media is objective and impartial, and admit that we\u2019ve returned to the historical norm of biased news.\n\nIf you were under the impression that the mainstream media is unbiased and committed to reporting \u201cjust the facts,\u201d then the media spectacle in recent days should disabuse you of that outdated notion. In fact, it should disabuse all of us of the idea that the news is objective and unbiased, and hasten the day when journalists and publishers can just be honest about their viewpoints, biases, and agendas.\n\nA pair of articles adapted from a new book about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh illustrates the point well. The book, written by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, includes a supposedly new misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh. But the excerpt that ran in the Times last week omitted an important detail: the alleged victim never made a claim against Kavanaugh and told friends she had no memory of the incident described by Pogrebin and Kelly.\n\nThe Times was forced to make a correction when my colleague Mollie Hemingway pointed out the omission. In several subsequent media interviews, Pogrebin and Kelly blamed their editors, insisting they included the crucial detail in an earlier version of the article but it was taken out by mistake in the editing process\u2014an excuse that strains credulity, especially since any final edits would have required the authors\u2019 approval.\n\nThen, it happened again. An excerpt of the book published this week in The Atlantic, \u201cWe Spent 10 Months Investigating Kavanaugh. Here\u2019s What We Found,\u201d also contains a major error. In a section explaining why they believe the uncorroborated accusation of Deborah Ramirez, Pogrebin and Kelly write, \u201cThe people who allegedly witnessed the event\u2014Kavanaugh\u2019s friends Kevin Genda, David Todd, and David White\u2014have kept mum about it.\u201d\n\nAs Hemingway noted, this isn\u2019t true. In the original New Yorker story about Ramirez\u2019s highly dubious accusation, Kavanaugh\u2019s friends weren\u2019t quiet about it. One male classmate denied any memory of the party in question, and others released a statement disputing Ramirez\u2019s account: \u201cWe can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it\u2014and we did not\u2026 Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this.\u201d\n\nYet Pogrebin and Kelly continue to pretend they\u2019re just reporting the facts. In a recent interview on \u201cThe View,\u201d Pogrebin said, \u201cWhat\u2019s lost in all this discussion is that what we tried to do was kind of what we always do as reporters, which is seek the facts, and put them out there, and let people come to their own conclusions.\u201d\n\nNYT Reporter Robin Pogrebin complains that \"people have seized on certain things\" but that \"it's fine to have Democratic candidates calling for impeachment\" pic.twitter.com/o5BFoLedPN \u2014 Madeline Osburn (@madelineorr) September 17, 2019\n\nBut they\u2019re not just reporting the facts. In the epilogue of their book, they admit as much, writing that even though they found no evidence\u2014no facts\u2014to support the claims against Kavanaugh, they concluded that his accusers were telling the truth because their \u201cgut\u201d told them so and because the accusers\u2019 stories \u201cring true.\u201d This is of course precisely the conclusion they\u2019re trying to get their readers to arrive at as well.\n\nThe Idea Of \u2018Objective\u2019 News Is Relatively Recent\n\nObviously, Pogrebin and Kelly have an agenda, just as their reporting was obviously guided to a large extent by their emotions, not the facts. The problem isn\u2019t necessarily that these two journalists are biased against Kavanaugh. The problem is that they pretend they\u2019re not biased when everyone can see that they are. The entire purpose of their book is to dredge up these horrible accusations\u2014however flimsy, regardless of the credibility of the accusers or the denials of supposed eyewitnesses\u2014and smear Kavanaugh.\n\nIf you want to write a book about how you think Kavanaugh was a serial sexual predator in college, and how you believe the accusations against him even though they can\u2019t be corroborated, then fine. Write away! But don\u2019t then go on national TV and claim that you\u2019re just a reporter reporting the facts.\n\nAll of this gets to a larger point, which is that journalism would be better off if major media organizations and journalists simply admitted they have biases and embraced viewpoint-specific news coverage.\n\nAfter all, the notion that journalism should be unbiased or \u201cfair and balanced\u201d is of relatively recent vintage. For much of American history, everyone knew that different newspapers and magazines had their particular biases, sometimes openly partisan ones. If you read Joseph Pulitzer\u2019s New York World you\u2019d get one perspective on the news, and an entirely different perspective if you read William Randolph Hearst\u2019s New York Journal. The advent of \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d journalism was in some ways a marketing ploy by the successors of Pulitzer and Hearst, who hoped to distinguish their papers from \u201cyellow journalism.\u201d\n\nIt was good marketing, bolstered by the advent of radio in the late 1920s and television in the 1940s, which brought the New Deal\u2019s Fairness Doctrine to bear on news broadcasting. What emerged in the middle of the last century, then, was a unique set of circumstances in which the idea of \u201cobjective\u201d news could thrive. As Telly Davidson argued in an essay for the American Conservative last year, a lot of this rested, as much of American life did in the postwar decades, on a broad cultural consensus:\n\nWhat today\u2019s controversies illustrate is that a so-called \u2018Fairness Doctrine\u2019 and \u2018objective\u2019 newspaper reporting could only have existed in a conformist Mad Men world where societal norms of what was (and wasn\u2019t) acceptable in the postwar Great Society operated by consensus. That is to say, an America where moderate, respectable, white male centrist Republicans like Thomas Dewey, Dwight Eisenhower, Nelson Rockefeller, and Gerald Ford \u2018debated\u2019 moderate, respectable, white male centrist Democrats like Harry Truman, Adlai Stevenson, Hubert Humphrey, and Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe Postwar Consensus Is Gone, and Never Coming Back\n\nAll of that is gone now, and has been gone for a while. The advent of the digital age has overthrown the postwar consensus of the electric age. Instead of uniting and binding us together, digital has atomized, fragmented, and enervated us. The result, in news media at least, is that everyone\u2019s biases and prejudices are impossible to hide, making a mockery of the idea that the news is \u201cobjective\u201d in any meaningful sense.\n\nWhat we have instead is the advent of a kind of digital yellow journalism. There\u2019s a reason President Trump\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d epithet has been appropriated by both sides of the political divide. It\u2019s really just another way of saying \u201cI don\u2019t recognize your authority over the facts.\u201d\n\nConsider a strange article NBC News recently ran, asking readers to confess their climate \u201csins.\u201d \u201cTell us: Where do you fall short in preventing climate change? Do you blast the A/C? Throw out half your lunch? Grill a steak every week? Share your anonymous confession with NBC News.\u201d\n\nThis, from a network news outlet that Americans with fond memories of Tom Brokaw\u2019s reassuring voice still think of as objective and unbiased. The article isn\u2019t just biased in favor of the religio-environmentalist view of carbon offsets being the new indulgences, it unapologetically promotes such a view.\n\nThat journalists and editors are overwhelmingly liberal is nothing new. But the imbalance is arguably getting worse. Even financial journalists, once thought to lean conservative, are overwhelmingly liberal. Last year, a survey of financial journalists at places like The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and Washington Post found that more than 58 percent identified as either \u201cvery liberal\u201d or \u201csomewhat liberal.\u201d Less than 5 percent said they were very or somewhat conservative.\n\nNow more than ever, media outlets should recognize that the myth of objectivity won\u2019t lend them credibility. In fact, a failure to admit bias will eventually undermine their credibility, not least because their reporters and editors will spout off on Twitter, or email and text chains will be leaked, or their readers will notice how errors and omissions always seem to benefit liberals and hurt conservatives.\n\nTo the extent that left-leaning journalists grasp this, many only seem to grasp it lightly. A great example is Lauren Duca\u2019s syllabus for a class called \u201cFeminist Journalist\u201d now being offered at New York University. (That Duca, mostly known for posting an offensive tweet upon the death of Billy Graham, is teaching a university-level journalism course is itself an indictment of the idea of unbiased journalism.)\n\nMedia coverage of our current political climate has been plagued by the mental Napalm [sic] that I call \u2018both sides-ism.\u2019 This is a kind of classic \u2018he said, she said\u2019 form of journalism where the reporter tries to give both sides of an issue, even if one side is completely bogus. You\u2019ll also hear it referred to as \u2018balance,\u2019 although in many cases it\u2019s \u2018false equivalency,\u2019 because attempting to appear balanced just serves to create more distortion.\n\n\n\nThe truth is not a math equation. In the midst of the ongoing American dumpster fire, there is, I believe, only one side to journalism, and it is motivated by building a truer, more equitable democracy. As this course will establish, not only does this effort allow for feminist journalists, it renders feminist journalism a moral necessity. We cannot build to social justice without adequate representation of intersectional perspectives.\n\nTo Duca\u2019s credit, she at least recognizes that objectivity in journalism is an illusion. But she takes the wrong lesson from it. Instead of embracing a transparency about her own bias, and recognizing that all journalists and media outlets have biases, she concludes there is \u201conly one side to journalism.\u201d No surprise that it happens to be the side she\u2019s on\u2014the side of \u201csocial justice.\u201d\n\nBut in fact there are many sides to journalism, all of them informed by biases, agendas, prejudices, and animosities. Anyone can see that. Almost everyone does. It would be great if journalists would start seeing that, too.", "description": "Let\u2019s dispense with the fiction that the media is objective and impartial, and admit that we\u2019ve returned to the historical norm of biased news.", "authors": ["John Daniel Davidson"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pulitzer-Hearst-War.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
