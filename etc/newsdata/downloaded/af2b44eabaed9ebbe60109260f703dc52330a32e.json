The bill including the proposed changes is expected to be voted on this month.\n\n\"Those provisions must be withdrawn now,\" said General Confederation of Workers in Greece (GSEE), the country's largest labour union, which represents about 2.5 million workers.\n\nLast week, the country's island ferries, along with public transport, hospitals and state schools, faced disruptions during a 24-hour action by the civil servants' umbrella union and other labour groups.\n\nBefore the most recent rallies, turnout had been low at such events in recent years, largely believed to be as a result of fatigue after years of a financial crisis that led to three international bailouts in exchange for pension and wage cuts, tax hikes and unpopular labour reforms.\n\nLenders want economy to grow\n\nUnions were once an influential force in the Greek workplace, but the country's eight-year recession, which wiped out a quarter of its economy, changed that.\n\n\u03a4he last conservative administration, in power from 2012 to 2014, effectively eliminated the public sector's right to strike by ordering transport workers and teachers to work on pain of imprisonment. It cited a law that gave the government special powers to protect the public interest.\n\nUnions now fear that the workers' rights lost during the recession, the worst in a developed post-World War II economy, will now remain suppressed in the name of the country's economic growth.\n\nGreece exited its third bailout programme in 2018, two years after returning to growth. However, its progress is still being monitored by its lenders, who expect it to achieve an ambitious primary surplus target, meaning the amount of income earned is higher than state spending, of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) annually through 2022 and 2.2 percent a year thereafter.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), one of the creditors, has also called for the labour market to be further freed up.\n\nMitsotakis's government has promised to negotiate a lowering of the targets with European lenders and wants to distribute a retirement bonus to pensioners next year, as his predecessor did before losing the elections in July.\n\nHe has also pledged to increase wages by reducing social security contributions and ease taxation to attract investors.", "description": "Workers walk off the job, responding to a government bill critics say will hurt unions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/22611da8edc04f0c8bbd0d589dae6e60_18.jpg"}
