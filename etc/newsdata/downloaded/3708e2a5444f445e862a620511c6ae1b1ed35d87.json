I got my husband to fill the hot water bottle for me with water from the kettle.\n\n\u2018I always tuck it down the front of my leggings to keep it secure. When I did it split down the seam.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t explain how it felt, I instantly felt sick.\n\n\u2018I shouted to Mark. I was trying to take my clothes off but my hand was burning. My husband ripped them off and started chucking cold tea towels at me to cool me down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Mark phoned an ambulance and I went into shock as my veins had collapsed.\u2019\n\nSophie, before the accident, is warning people to listen to advice and never use boiling water in hot water bottles (Picture: MEN)\n\nThe mum-of-four said she \u2018immediately felt sick\u2019 (Picture: MEN)\n\nSophie was rushed to hospital where she needed two skin grafts to repair the extensive damage to her stomach and leg, where her skin had painfully burnt off.\n\nA burn on her hand had left her nerves exposed.\n\nShe said: \u2018The nurses were trying to get control all the blisters that were coming up \u2013 there must have been 100 blisters on my stomach and legs. They were popping them open and covering me up to protect my me.\u2019\n\nOn 4 October, Sophie underwent a three hour operation to cover her burns by covering them with skin from the back of her right thigh.\n\nShe said: \u2018They didn\u2019t initially know how deep the burns were because they take about two or three says to show how bad they are.\n\n\u2018When I went for a check up they weren\u2019t sure whether I needed a skin graft, but I went back on Friday and they said I needed two.\n\n\u2018After the operation I had to stay in hospital as my graft was bleeding and I had to go back last night as well.\n\nThe water bottle had been tucked into Sophie\u2019s leggings when it split open (Picture: MEN)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m in a lot of pain and my mobility is very limited. It\u2019s had a very big impact and it\u2019s going to for a while. It\u2019s not going to get better for months.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriends were horrified by the accident and Sophie has urged them and others to never fill hot water bottles with boiling water.\n\nShe said: \u2018Listen to your husband when he says don\u2019t do it. He\u2019s been telling me for years and I\u2019ve been saying you\u2019re paranoid.\n\n\u2018I know so many people who\u2019ve said they do this. They always advise not to put boiling water inside in case this happens.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just grateful it happened to me and not a child.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
