That\u2019s down from its 2.6% estimate in April and a gain of 3% last year.\n\nA closely watched index of factory activity dropped to 47.8 in September from 49.1 the prior month, according to the Institute for Supply Management. That\u2019s below the reading of 50 that economists expected and reflects a contraction in the sector for the second straight month. An index above 50 means expansion while below means contraction.\n\nHow to ace this college aid application: Avoid these 3 pitfalls when filling out the FAFSA\n\nIt's Techtober: Your guide to releases from Amazon, GoPro, Facebook and more\n\nThe index clocked in at the lowest level since June 2009, just after the Great Recession ended.\n\nManufacturing makes up only about 12% of the economy. But troubles in the sector can have an outsize effect on the economy by damping business confidence and curtailing factory payrolls, which in turn hurts consumer spending, says economist Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics.\n\n\u201cThis does increase the likelihood of entering a more pronounced slowdown,\u201d Daco says. Oxford reckons the odds of a recession are 40% next year but many economists are predicting a downturn. Solid consumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic activity, had somewhat eased fears of a slump but the deepening skid in manufacturing is stoking those concerns anew.\n\nMeasures of production and employment shrank more sharply than in August while new export orders fell at a faster pace for a third straight month. An index of overall orders \u2013 which typically foreshadows future production -- rose slightly but remained in contraction territory.\n\nManufacturing activity track for the second straight month in September.

Trump has slapped tariffs on most imports from China, increasing costs for U.S. businesses and consumers. China has responded in kind, crimping U.S. exports to that country.\n\nPresident Trump, however, blamed the weakening manufacturing outlook on one of his favorite targets \u2013 the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cAs I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. \u201cFed Rate too high.
